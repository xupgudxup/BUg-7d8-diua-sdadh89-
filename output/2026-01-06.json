    "fullText": "The Oklahoma City Thunder hit rock bottom in their 124-97 loss to the Charlotte Hornets on Monday. It's easily the worst loss of the season — and really, the worst in years in terms of humiliation.\n\nThe Thunder trailed by as many as 30 points. A recent mediocre stretch has reached a fever pitch. That's what happens when you get dominated at home against a rebuild team.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander struggled with 21 points on 7-of-21 shooting. Jalen Williams had 16 points and four assists. Chet Holmgren was quiet with 15 points and six rebounds.\n\nMeanwhile, Brandon Miller scored an efficient 28 points. Kon Knueppel went off for 23 points and five rebounds. Miles Bridges had 17 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nLet's look at some of the best photos from the Thunder's 27-point loss to the Hornets:\n\nThis article originally appeared on OKC Thunder Wire: Photos: Best images from Thunder's 124-97 loss to Hornets",

    "fullText": "Former Real Madrid assistant manager Davide Ancelotti has ruled himself out of the running to replace Xabi Alonso, should Los Blancos dismiss the Basque manager. Alonso is facing a critical week to define the direction of his project, with a Spanish Supercup semi-final against Atletico Madrid on Thursday, and a potential final against one of Athletic Club or Barcelona.\n\nThe latest is that depending on how things go, it could be decisive for Alonso’s future, with the Real Madrid hierarchy keen to see that their run of four wins can be backed up with improved performances and results against quality opposition. Something he will more than likely have to achieve without Kylian Mbappe too.\n\nAncelotti junior, son of manager last season Carlo Ancelotti, was spotted at the Bernabeu during Real Madrid’s 5-1 win over Real Betis. Interviewed by Marca, he explained he was at the stadium as a fan.\n\n“I’m on vacation now and I’ve come to support Real Madrid. The lucky charm is here and you have to win it. I’m glad I brought them luck,” he joked. “I’m going to give Dad a hand,” Ancelotti explained when asked about his future plans, having just left his first senior job at Botafogo in Brazil after six months.\n\nThe younger Ancelotti was highly regarded during his time at Valdebebas, and while things turned sour towards the end of his spell, was often said to be in charge of the bulk of the coaching work on the training ground. He was also credited with several tactical innovations during his father’s second spell at the club. He was effusive in his praise for the incumbent Alonso though, who he crossed paths with as a coach during Carlo Ancelotti’s first spell.\n\n“Xabi is a fantastic coach and a wonderful person. I only have good things to say about him because we’ve shared some great moments. I wish him and Real Madrid all the best.”\n\nThere had been some that had suggested he could be at least an interim option if Alonso was sacked, but asked directly about it, Davide Ancelotti ruled that out.\n\n“Nothing of the sort. I’m in a different stage of my professional life. I’m just a Real Madrid fan and a friend of Xabi Alonso, that’s all.”\n\nIn the event Real Madrid do decide to move on from Alonso midseason, Sporting Director Santiago Solari and Castilla manager Alvaro Arbeloa have been cited as the most likely replacements.",

    "fullText": "Sweden captured its first World Juniors gold in 14 years, and just the third in program history. Two of the key figures were goaltender Love Härenstam and captain Jack Berglund, who once again led the way for his team. When the final horn sounded, the celebration was unrestrained.\n\n“What a group! I’m so impressed with how we come out today. Wow. There’s so much character in this team, I don’t even know what to say. I’m so proud of the guys, and I’m so happy, I’m so happy,” said Jack Berglund to the Swedish TV channel SVT after the game.\n\nBerglund recorded the primary assist on Sweden’s first two goals of the game. In postgame interviews, he was quick to emphasize the team effort and how much the moment meant to him personally.\n\n“You can hardly win anything bigger than this. You grow up with this tournament. To have the honor of wearing the C is huge, and it doesn’t get any better than this. I’m so happy,” he said.\n\nHe continued: “We’ve been talking about this since the summer, and I felt that something good was coming. Everyone has just grown throughout the tournament,” said Jack Berglund to SVT after the final buzzer.\n\nWhen asked what he will remember most, Berglund did not hesitate with his answer.\n\n“It’s the brotherhood. In this group, we’re everything to each other. From the players and coaches to the staff, everyone around us and everyone who has supported us. But above all, it’s this small group. Wow. I have no words,” said Jack Berglund to SVT.\n\nAnother strong performer in the final was goaltender Love Härenstam. Czechia scored two late goals to cut into the lead, but before that Härenstam turned aside several high-danger chances. When the final horn sounded, he was visibly overcome with emotion.\n\n“The best feeling in the world. I’ve never been this happy. So much fun,” said Härenstam to SVT.\n\n“We play really well, and they do a good job six-on-five at the end. Then it’s an incredible feeling when Ivar Stenberg manages to poke the puck in and you can finally let the emotions out. It’s magical!”\n\n“We Deserved That”: Goaltender Love Härenstam After Statement Win Love Härenstam reflected on an emotional New Year’s Eve win as Sweden defeated the United States at the World Juniors.",

    "title": "Sources: Hawks actively discussing Trae Young trade avenues with nothing imminent",
    "description": "The Hawks have begun internal discussions with Trae Young and his representation about a potential trade, but no deal is imminent.",
    "fullText": "Sources: Hawks actively discussing Trae Young trade avenues with nothing imminent appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nTrae Young’s time with the Atlanta Hawks appears to be coming to an end. After being far apart during offseason discussions regarding a potential contract extension, Young and his camp have actively been discussing the potential of trade avenues to move the four-time All-Star guard before the Feb. 5 NBA trade deadline, league sources told ClutchPoints on Monday.\n\nThe writing had been on the wall regarding Young’s future in Atlanta, given stalled contract negotiations and the emergence of Jalen Johnson, whom the Hawks are fully invested in building around for the foreseeable future as their franchise cornerstone.\n\nThis developing story about Young and the Hawks beginning discussions about a potential trade, which was first reported by ESPN, is the latest trade story captivating the NBA landscape, as trade dialogue between the star guard, his camp, and Atlanta’s front office, led by first-year GM Onsi Saleh, started right before the calendar flipped to 2026.\n\nWith just about four weeks until the NBA trade deadline, the Hawks are now actively working with Young and his camp with a common goal of finding a destination where the 27-year-old can immediately receive a new contract extension, sources said. To this point, trade discussions with rival teams have been minimal, and the Hawks are not close to finalizing any deal involving Young.\n\nAtlanta is keeping an open mind to any and all paths that present themselves, while also understanding what Young and his representation want. The Hawks’ guard is making roughly $46 million this season and has a near $49 million player option for the 2026-27 season. All indications suggest that Young will opt into his option, which leads to obvious complications in a potential trade.\n\nAlthough Young has proven to be an elite shot creator in Atlanta over the years, leading the league in assists during the 2024-25 season, there is no demand for the 6-foot-2 guard, especially given concerns surrounding his defensive skills.\n\nDespite this notion and his limitations on defense, the Washington Wizards emerged as a potential suitor for Young on Monday, as first reported by longtime NBA insider Marc Stein. The main point of these discussions surrounded the possibility of a swap involving CJ McCollum, who is in the final year of his contract and making $30.6 million, for Young.\n\nSuch a move would require the Wizards to include an extra $6.8 million in outgoing salary to absorb Young’s contract.\n\nHowever, the Wizards have signaled that they hold no interest in sacrificing any young assets in a trade for young, league sources said. The inclusion of young talent in a deal for Young is something the Hawks desire, especially given Washington’s request for draft compensation to be included by Atlanta.\n\nThese two teams talked recently about a McCollum-Young swap, a deal that would immediately open financial flexibility up for the Hawks in the offseason. The Wizards have made it clear they would need additional draft value from the Hawks if they were to facilitate such a trade, prompting Atlanta’s rebuttal for one of Washington’s recent draftees to be included.\n\nThis grouping of players the Hawks were likely discussing, which has not been confirmed to ClutchPoints by both parties, likely includes Bilal Coulibaly, Kyshawn George, and Tre Johnson.\n\nThe Wizards are also said to be evaluating their position and immediate future if such a move to trade for Young were made. McCollum has been a leading voice since arriving in the summer, primarily for Johnson, the team’s sixth-overall pick from just over six months ago.\n\nAs a result, these initial negotiations between the Hawks and Wizards have not reached a point where a trade is imminent. There is still plenty of time for Atlanta and Washington to work out the details of such of move with the trade deadline weeks away. The Hawks will continue to seek other avenues between now and then as well.\n\nOverall, Young’s value is at a point where the Hawks are no longer in the driver’s seat to dictate the terms of such a trade, which is why if the organization truly wants to part ways with him before the deadline, any team trading for him will have the upper hand.\n\nPlenty of teams that have been mentioned as possible suitors for Young in the past are not interested, including the Sacramento Kings, according to Sam Amick of The Athletic. The Brooklyn Nets and Houston Rockets, two other teams to appear in rumors connected to Young through the years, do not hold interest in acquiring the star guard, sources said.\n\nWith this said, Brooklyn remains open to facilitating any potential deals where rival teams seek a third organization for potential salary-dump-like moves. The Nets and GM Sean Marks are always willing to listen and be involved in potential trades for draft picks, which could open the door for them to be involved in a potential Young trade or another similar deal before this year’s trade deadline.\n\nWithout Young on the court this season, the Hawks have posted a 15-13 record, including a 118-100 loss on Monday night to the Toronto Raptors. With him, the Hawks have gone 2-8 and are giving up an average of over 126 points per game to their opponents, about a negative nine-point differential compared to when Young is off the floor.\n\nThe Hawks are 17-21 overall this season.\n\nYoung, who missed about seven weeks earlier this season as a result of a right MCL sprain, has missed five straight games for the Hawks due to a right quad contusion. Even though he is currently dealing with this quad injury, there is still a chance Young returns to the court and plays for Atlanta before the trade deadline.\n\nIn 10 games this season, all of which he has started, Young has averaged 19.3 points and 8.9 assists per game while shooting 41.5 percent from the floor and 30.5 percent from 3-point range.\n\nBetween now and the trade deadline, the Hawks, Young, and his representation will continue to explore the trade market for the All-Star guard, with the Wizards appearing to be a clear favorite early in the process.",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON -- Two nights after a frustrating and injury riddled loss in Dallas, the Rockets (22-11) got back to their winning ways with Monday’s thrilling 100-97 victory (box score) over the Suns.\n\nIn a matchup of Western Conference rivals, Houston is 3-0 against Phoenix this season. Overall, Houston has won five of its last six games, and the Rockets are now 11-1 in their last 12 home games at Toyota Center.\n\nWith Monday’s win, the Rockets are in a virtual tie with the Los Angeles Lakers (22-11) and Denver Nuggets (24-12) for the No. 3 spot in the West. On the other side, Phoenix is holding at No. 7 in the standings.\n\nThe big story for the Rockets was All-Star forward and future Hall of Famer Kevin Durant, who hit the game-winning shot with only 1.1 seconds left to play. Durant finished with a team-high 26 points (42.9% FG) and 10 rebounds, and he made key defensive contributions on a night in which the Suns were limited to just 37 points in the second half.\n\n“I don’t mean to sound too dramatic, but I will,” said Durant, who was traded from Phoenix to Houston last June.\n\n“To be kicked out of a place — and I felt like I’d been scapegoated for the issues we had as a team last year — yeah, it felt good to beat them and hit a game-winning shot. You play with a bit of a chip on your shoulder when you play your former team, especially when they trade you.”\n\nKevin Durant said he was \"scapegoated\" for Suns' poor season last year. Adds he felt like he was \"kicked out of\" Phoenix, had chip on his shoulder tonight.\n\nFull quote from @KDTrey5 ⬇️\n\n\"I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but I will.

    "fullText": "The Calgary Flames saw their recent home momentum stall Monday night, falling 5–1 to the Seattle Kraken at the Scotiabank Saddledome in their second straight loss on home ice.\n\nCalgary’s fourth line set an early tone with speed and physicality, rewarding the Flames with the game’s opening goal midway through the first period. After Dustin Wolf turned aside a quality chance at one end, the Flames transitioned quickly up ice. Ryan Lomberg fired a shot on goal and Adam Klapka followed up, burying the rebound for his fourth goal of the season. Mackenzie Weegar picked up the lone assist, extending his three-game point streak (4a).\n\nThe Flames nearly doubled their lead moments later when Jonathan Huberdeau was hauled down on a breakaway, earning a penalty shot. Huberdeau tried to go blocker side on Seattle goaltender Philipp Grubauer, but the Kraken netminder stood tall to keep it a one-goal game.\n\nCalgary controlled much of the opening frame, outshooting Seattle 13–8 and carrying a 1–0 lead into the first intermission.\n\nSeattle evened the score early in the second period as Jacob Melanson found space and one-timed a pass from the corner past Wolf for his first career NHL goal. Despite sustained pressure from the Flames — who directed 17 shots on goal in the middle frame — the game remained knotted at one heading into the third.\n\nThe Kraken seized control early in the final period. Ben Meyers floated a pass across the slot to Shane Wright, who snapped home the go-ahead goal on his 22nd birthday to make it 2–1. Vince Dunn added insurance shortly after, stepping into a wrist shot from the high slot that beat Wolf cleanly for his sixth of the season.\n\nWith the Flames pressing late and Wolf pulled for the extra attacker, Seattle put the game away. Freddie Gaudreau slid the puck into the empty net before Matty Beniers capped the scoring, collecting a rebound and spinning a backhand through the five-hole to make it 5–1.\n\nDespite outshooting Seattle in the game, Calgary couldn’t match the Kraken’s execution in the third as the visitors pulled away.\n\nCalgary’s fourth line delivered early, bringing energy, physical play, and the opening goal. Adam Klapka had five hits and scored a goal in the contest and Ryan Lomberg added an assist, as the two players continue to provide a noticeable spark when deployed.\n\nThe Flames generated chances and controlled stretches of play through 40 minutes, but Seattle capitalized in the third period as Calgary’s pace dropped and mistakes crept in.\n\nHome stretch ends on a sour note\n\nCalgary had won nine of its previous 11 games at the Saddledome, but consecutive losses to close out the homestand leave the Flames looking to regroup on the road.",

    "fullText": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (USF) — The University of Sioux Falls men’s basketball team kept their momentum rolling on Monday afternoon, grinding out an 81–75 victory over Briar Cliff inside the Stewart Center. The win pushed the Cougars’ winning streak to four games in a physical, paint-dominated battle that required clutch execution and second-half composure to put away a scrappy Charger squad.\n\nThis was a blue-collar victory through and through. Both teams traded blows in a back-and-forth contest that stayed tight for the better part of 40 minutes. Sioux Falls shot an efficient 50 percent from the field (32-of-64), methodically attacking the rim and imposing their will in the paint while Briar Cliff refused to go away quietly.\n\nFour Cougars reached double figures, led by Brogan Madson’s team-high 21 points, as USF found ways to score even when the perimeter game went cold. The difference came after halftime, where Sioux Falls outscored the Chargers 43–37 behind relentless interior scoring and timely free-throw shooting that ultimately sealed the deal.\n\nTaylen Ashley and Madson combined for 21 second-half points, while Brandon Hrncir delivered a perfect shooting performance after the break. When the dust settled, it was the Cougars’ dominance on the glass and their poise in crunch time that made the difference in the six-point win.\n\nBriar Cliff came out sharp, connecting on 15-of-31 from the floor while Sioux Falls answered with a 15-of-33 effort. Neither team found a rhythm from deep—USF managed just 2-of-10 from three while the Chargers hit 4-of-13. The Cougars established their identity early, however, bullying Briar Cliff inside for a 24–16 paint advantage.\n\nThe first 20 minutes featured five lead changes and four ties as neither squad could create separation. Ball security was excellent on both sides with just two turnovers apiece, and the rebounding battle stayed competitive with USF holding a narrow 20–17 edge. The teams headed to the locker room deadlocked after a tightly contested opening half.\n\nSioux Falls took control after intermission, outscoring Briar Cliff 43–37 to close out the victory. The paint remained the Cougars’ domain, where they pounded out a 28–16 scoring advantage in the half. Ashley sparked the offense with 11 second-half points while Madson added 10 more, consistently attacking a tiring Charger defense.\n\nHrncir was surgical in the second half—a flawless 4-for-4 from the field for nine points while pulling down five rebounds. The Cougars crashed the offensive glass for seven second-half boards, creating extra possessions at critical moments. When the game was on the line, Madson calmly sank all of his free throws to ice the win.\n\n“It was good to keep our winning streak going. We didn’t play our best basketball, but give Briar Cliff a lot of credit for that. We found a way, and now we need to get back to practice and get ready for road games at Duluth and Bemidji.”\n— Head Coach Chris Johnson\n\nBrogan Madson – 21 points (8-of-14 FG), 3 assists\n\nTaylen Ashley – 19 points, 4 rebounds\n\nBrandon Hrncir – 19 points (8-of-11 FG), 9 rebounds, 3 assists\n\nKyle Ingwerson – 10 points, 7 rebounds\n\nPaint: Sioux Falls owned a 52–32 advantage in points in the paint.\n\nRebounding: The Cougars outrebounded Briar Cliff 42–28, including 10 offensive rebounds.\n\nShooting: USF finished at 50.0 percent from the field while holding Briar Cliff to fewer second-half opportunities inside.\n\nBalance: Four Cougars scored in double figures, providing consistent offense throughout the lineup.\n\nFree Throws: Sioux Falls went 12-of-17 at the line, converting key attempts late.\n\nThe Cougars hit the road next weekend, traveling to face Minnesota Duluth on January 9 and Bemidji State on January 10.",

    "fullText": "SPARTANBURG, S.C. – After dominant performances at Western Carolina and The Citadel, Wofford men’s basketball junior guard, Nils Machowski, has been awarded the Lou Henson National Player of the Week and Southern Conference Player of the Week as the organizations announced the awards on Monday.\n\nMachowski lifted the Terriers to a pair of road wins to open Southern Conference play. Opening the week with a close matchup in Cullowhee, North Carolina, the junior was within one point of his career-high, scoring 27 points while going 9-15 from the field and 4-9 from three. He also added seven rebounds, including two offensive boards, two assists, and one steal and block. Just three days later, the guard broke his career high while setting a new team high in scoring this season with 37 points at The Citadel. He found eight threes on 11 attempts, lifting him to the highest points scored by a Terrier since Fletcher Magee’s 36 points at Samford on February 15, 2019. He also went 5-5 from the line, contributing two rebounds, two assists, two steals, and a block.\n\nFor the season, the Berlin, Germany, native has started all 15 games, scoring double digits in all but two games. He is averaging 15.5 points and 4.4 rebounds per game while picking up 42 assists and 15 steals. The guard is shooting .400 percent from the field and .330 percent from three. He also leads the team in free throw shooting, going 54-66 (.818) from the line.\n\nMachowski is the first Terrier ever to earn the Lou Henson National Player of the Week award. He is the second Terrier to win SoCon Player of the Week this season. He becomes the 35th Terrier to receive the honor since joining the Southern Conference in 1997. This is the second time that a Terrier has been awarded SoCon Player of the Week in the opening weekend.\n\nThe Terriers (10-5, 2-0) open home conference play with UNC Greensboro on January 7, before heading back on the road to Macon, Georgia, to face the Mercer Bears on January 10.",

    "description": "The Los Angeles Kings are two forwards short, as center Anze Kopitar and right winger Joel Armia exited their game against the Minnesota Wild early.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Kings are forced to finish their game against the Minnesota Wild with two fewer forwards than they started with. The team will have to manage without their captain, Anze Kopitar and right winger Joel Armia.\n\nThe Kings announced that Kopitar would not return to the game with a lower-body injury, while Armia is sidelined with an upper-body injury.\n\nKopitar played just 4:54 of ice time in the first period, and didn't return for the start of the second frame. Los Angeles said he would not return during the second period.\n\nAs for Armia, his departure was announced by the Kings during the second intermission. He had 9:14 of ice time before being removed from the game, forcing Los Angeles to finish the match with 10 forwards.\n\nFrom Kopitar to Uncertainty: The Kings’ Center Crisis LOS ANGELES, CA — For two decades, the Los Angeles Kings have had the luxury franchises spend years chasing: a true number one centerman in Anze Kopitar. Alongside Jonathan Quick and Drew Doughty, the Kings formed Hockey's Holy Trinity—three franchise-level pillars down the middle, on the back end, and in net. In their primes, all three ranked among the very best at their respective positions. That spine was the foundation of two Stanley Cups in three years, before the Mike Richards and Slava Voynov situations derailed the Lombardi administration.\n\nThe Kopitar is in the final campaign to cap off a 20-year career, all of which has been with the Kings.\n\nThis is the second time this season that Kopitar has been dealing with a lower-body injury. In the middle of October, he missed about a couple of weeks with a lower-body injury.\n\nThat previous injury was from a puck hitting him in the ankle area, a clearing attempt from teammate and Kings right winger Adrian Kempe. Nonetheless, it's unclear to this point if that injury is connected to what forced him out of Los Angeles' contest with Minnesota.\n\nThis was Kopitar's 37th appearance of the season, and in that span, he's recorded six goals and 15 assists for 21 points. With that, he leads all Kings players in the plus-minus department with a plus-12 rating.\n\nGoing into this game against the Wild, Kopitar has been averaging 18:54 of ice time per game, the lowest average ice time he's ever logged in his career. He ranks fourth among forwards on the Kings in average ice time, sitting behind Kevin Fiala, Kempe, and Quinton Byfield, who leads all forwards.\n\nIn addition, the Slovenian is just one point away from reaching the 1,300 mark. Only 38 players in NHL history have reached that milestone.\n\nFurthermore, once the Kings and Wild game is in the history books, he'll be just nine games away from recording 1,500 NHL games, which only 24 players have done in NHL history.\n\nArmia, on the other hand, may have miss the Olympics if his injury is notably significant. Finland announced that Armia made the Olympic roster on Jan. 2 - the tournament begins on Feb. 11.\n\nThis season, the 32-year-old has played 41 games - including the clash with the Wild on Monday - and has registered nine goals and 16 points for the Kings.\n\nThis is Armia's first campaign with the Kings following a seven-year tenure with the Montreal Canadiens. He signed a two-year contract at $2.5 million per season in the off-season.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "fullText": "With the game tight between the Golden State Warriors and the Los Angeles Clippers in the fourth quarter, officials appeared to miss a pair of crucial calls that could've benefited the Warriors.\n\nFirst, Steph Curry was fouled before drilling a high-arcing circus shot that swished through the net. However, officials waived off a continuation on the shot, and ruled the foul on the floor, wiping away the highlight reel bucket. The Warriors went on to miss their shot after the foul followed by a 3-pointer from the Clippers on the next possession.\n\nOn the Warriors' next trip down the court, Draymond Green found Gary Payton II cutting to the basket for a layup. The layup was quickly blocked by John Collins. However, the ball appeared to touch the glass on a potential goaltending call.\n\nAfter the referees didn't blow the whistle, a furious Steve Kerr came onto the floor to argue for a goaltending call. Kerr was quickly hit with a pair of technical fouls and ejected from the game in Los Angeles.\n\nAn absolutely irate Steve Kerr was ejected after refs missed a goaltending call on the Clippers 😳 pic.twitter.com/9UIqaEvTPv\n\n— Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) January 6, 2026\n\nWith Kerr hitting the locker room early, former Portland Trail Blazers head coach and current Golden State assistant, Terry Stotts, took over for Kerr.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Warriors' Steve Kerr ejected in 4th quarter vs Clippers",

    "description": "The New York Rangers’ 3-2 loss to the Utah Mammoth was overshadowed by Igor Shetserkin’s injury scare.",
    "fullText": "The New York Rangers’ 3-2 loss to the Utah Mammoth was overshadowed by Igor Shetserkin’s injury scare.\n\nIn the first period, with JJ Peterka driving to the net, Shesterkin’s leg seemed to get caught in an awkward position.\n\nAfter lying on the ice in agony for over a minute, Shesterkin made his way to the locker room with the help of a trainer, unable to put any weight on his leg.\n\nMike Sullivan confirmed that Shesterkin is being evaluated for a lower-body injury, but he did not delve into much detail regarding his long-term status.\n\n“I mean, obviously we don't want him to get hurt,” Sullivan said. “He's an important part of this team, and hopefully it's not too serious. I don't have an answer for you because obviously they're gonna do more more testament right now he's being evaluated.”\n\nWhile it’s never safe to assume anything, Shesterkin’s injury certainly did look concerning, and if he is indeed slated to miss a long period of time, the Rangers are in a heap of trouble.\n\nShesterkin serves as the Rangers’ engine, and his loss for any period of time is extremely problematic for the Blueshirts.\n\n“There are certain guys that drive your team. He's one of them for us,” Sullivan said of Shesterkin. “He's an elite player at his position. I think he's one of the very best in the game. When you lose a player like that for any length of time, those types of players are difficult to replace.”\n\nJonathan Quick ultimately filled in for the injured Shesterkin and recorded 14 saves on 17 shots. He set the tone, making some crucial stops while also showing a level of passion, specifically when Daniil But bumped into him, and decided to go after him.\n\nIf Shesterkin is to miss time, the Rangers will be forced to rely on the 39-year-old Quick.\n\n“He's a fierce competitor. He's still an excellent goalie,” Sullivan said of Quick. “He's one of the leaders in that room, for good reason. His body of work speaks for itself. If you ask my opinion, I think he's a first ballot Hall of Famer with what he's accomplished in the game. He loves the game, and he loves to compete, and he's very capable.”\n\nThe game, in which the Rangers were unable to hold onto a one-goal lead in the third period, en route to an overtime loss, feels meaningless due to what could possibly be at stake with Shesterkin’s injury and the ripple effect it would have on the rest of the team.\n\nAs it stands right now, the Rangers are three points out of a wild-card spot with three games in hand as it will be a dog fight to make the playoffs.\n\nIgor Shesterkin Exits Game Against Mammoth After Suffering Scary-Looking Injury In the first period of the New York <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/new-york-rangers\">Rangers</a>’ Monday night game against the Utah Mammoth, Igor Shesterkin suffered a scary-looking lower-body injury.&nbsp;\n\nThe direction Blueshirts’ general manager Chris Drury will go at the trade deadline would drastically change if Shesterkin’s injury were to be serious.\n\nWhen talking on WFAN Radio, Rangers owner James Dolan gave a vote of confidence to Drury, preaching patience as the team tries to build a culture under Sullivan, essentially ensuring Drury is not on the hot seat despite the team’s disastrous 2024-25 campaign and inconsistencies through the first half of this season.\n\nStaying a float in the Eastern Conference is a difficult task without Shesterkin.\n\nIf Shesterkin is out for a long period of time, Drury may be forced to take a selling approach at the trade deadline, directly impacting Artemi Panarin, who is set to become an unrestricted free agent this summer and is still without a long-term contract extension past the 2025-26 season.\n\nThere’s a lot that hinders on Shesterkin, and the severity of his injury will in all likelihood be revealed within the next couple of days.",

    "fullText": "The Chicago Blackhawks were excited as an organization when they selected Anton Frondell with the third overall pick in the 2025 NHL Draft. He has since been great as a teenager in the SHL, and now he is complete with the 2025-26 World Junior Championships.\n\nFrondell and Team Sweden won the Gold Medal on Monday night. This is their first Gold Medal at the World Junior Championships since 2012. Every player on the team, including Frondell, played incredibly and deserves this win.\n\nSweden defeated Czechia 4-2 to take the tournament. To get to the final game, they defeated their biggest rival in Team Finland, in a shootout (Frondell scored the winning goal). Along the way, they were great at defending, scoring, and performing on special teams.\n\nThe final three minutes of the 2026 world juniors featured enough chaos for an entire tournament, but in the end, Sweden took gold for the first time since 2012 and just the third time in tourney history. \n\n✍️: @THNRyanKennedy https://t.co/r0Bc0Sxffa\n\n— The Hockey News (@TheHockeyNews) January 6, 2026\n\nOn the Silver Medal-winning Czechia team was Blackhawks draft pick Vaclav Nestrasil. The 2025 25th overall pick had a wonderful tournament as well, including an assist in the Gold Medal Game. Once again, Czechia had a solid showing at this tournament, and Nestrasil was a big part of this one. He finished the tournament with two goals and six assists for eight points in 7 games.\n\nOn the Gold Medal-winning Sweden Team, Frondell was one of their top players. After advancing to the championship, he was named one of the \"3 Best Players on Team Sweden\". Once they won Gold, he was named to the Tournament All-Star Team, along with being called the Top Forward.\n\nFrondell scored a remarkable five goals in the tournament. He also added 3 assists for 8 points in 7 games played. Those stats, his individual awards, and the Gold Medal speak to how successful he was for his country. It won't be long before he is in Chicago's lineup, making an impact.\n\n\"Incredible,\" Frondell said when asked how it felt to win. \"I'm just so happy right now. It's crazy. I love it.\"\n\nThe young players on this team seemed to enjoy each other. Their chemistry and friendship were strong off the ice, which led to success on the ice.\n\n\"This group, it's fantastic how tight we are. We're like a big family.\" Frondell continued. \"It's important if you want to win.\"\n\nChicago did have a third player participating in the tournament. AJ Spellacy and Team USA went out during the quarterfinals. They were defeated in overtime by Team Finland, ending their quest to three-peat at the tournament. Spellacy finished with one goal and three assists for four points in five games.\n\nAhead of the Gold Medal Game, Canada defeated Finland to claim the Bronze Medal. There were no Blackhawks prospects involved in that game, but there was a lot of scouting that took place.\n\nGiven the nature of the up-and-down season that the Chicago Blackhawks are having at the NHL level, it is hard to predict where they will be drafting. However, there were a lot of great young players who showed their stuff throughout the tournament:\n\nGavin McKenna Silences Critics With Four Points In Bronze Medal Win For Canada At The World Junior Championship TSN's director of scouting said it was a \"mixed\" tournament for the top draft prospect, who tied for second among Canadians with 14 points in seven games\n\nWorld Juniors 2026: NHL Draft Eligibles Stenberg, McKenna Highlight Standouts From Medal Day Sweden did it.

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Whew! The FCS college football season saved its best for last when Montana State defeated Illinois State in overtime to win the national championship, 35-34, on Monday night.\n\nIllinois State came into the game an unlikely unseeded finalist — and then erased a 14-point deficit to put another seeded team on the ropes, controlling the clock and the line of scrimmage before being undone by special teams and a clutch throw.\n\nThe FCS championship had it all — and social media was there for it. We took a spin around X.com for some reactions to the messy but magical championship game:\n\nFCS championship recap: Illinois State rallies, but loses OT thriller to Montana State\n\nIt seemed as if few on social media had a rooting interest, but instead appreciated the OT thriller simply for its dramatics. Multiple sports personalities chimed in with superlatives, including:\n\nEddie Radosevich of On3.com wrote: \"You are doing a disservice to yourself if you aren’t watching the FCS national championship.\"\n\nPodcaster Van Lathan Jr.: \"This FCS Natty game is insane.\"\n\nESPN commentator Kirk Herbstreit, posted after the game and congratulated both teams: \"This FCS National Championship is INCREDIBLE!!!!! Came down to an extra point in OT! ... What a game!\n\nFanDuel and TNT Sports host Mike Golic Jr: \"100000/10 finish to the FCS title game. absolutely deranged, beautiful, sloppy football. ... I need a cigarette.\"\n\nTikTok creator GFed: \"Perfect playoff for the FCS Infinitely more fun than bowl games, I will be more invested in this next season.\"\n\nThe Ringer's Rodger Sherman, posted multiple times about the game, including: \"FCS national championship was the college football game of the year. Congrats to Montana State and if you're an Illinois State fan I am so so so so so so so so so so so sorry.\"\n\nIllinois State & Montana State in Nashville on a random Monday night in January pic.twitter.com/lsRP37blGo\n\n— Barstool Greg (@iambarstoolgreg) January 6, 2026\n\nMontana State receiver Taco Dowler was the toast of X.com on Monday night. The shifty kid with a silly name scored the game-tying touchdown, pulling in a fourth-down pass from quarterback Justin Lamson in the endzone with the game on the line.\n\nThe 5-foot-9, 175-pound receiver finished with 133 scrimmage yards on nine touches, getting his unique name uttered multiple times from the ESPN announcing crew.\n\nDowler — whose real first name is McLean — apparently got his name in an unusual way.\n\n\"One account goes like this,\" wrote Mike Scherting of 406MTSports.com. \"Young McLean was in a Taco Bell drive-thru with his family when he spotted the sign and blurted out, 'That's my name.' \"\n\nMontana State kicker Myles Sansted followed the TD with the game-winning extra point — and the rest is history.\n\nIllinois State kicker Michael Coseninto had a rougher time on Monday night. The junior had a pair of kicks blocked, the first a potentially game-winning field goal in regulation and then an extra point in the first overtime.\n\nMany X.com users were less than kind.

    "fullText": "INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) — Kawhi Leonard had 24 points and 12 rebounds, rookie Kobe Sanders added 20 points, and the Los Angeles Clippers edged the Golden State Warriors 103-102 on Monday night in a wild game that included Warriors coach Steve Kerr getting ejected and Steph Curry fouling out for the first time since 2021.\n\nKerr was ejected with 7:57 remaining in the game after becoming irate when the Clippers’ John Collins wasn’t called for goaltending. A shouting Kerr pursued the referees along the sideline and had to be restrained by his assistants before getting tossed.\n\nCurry scored 27 points but was just 4 for 15 from 3-point range and 9 for 23 overall before fouling out with 42 seconds remaining in the game. He fouled out for the first time since Dec. 17, 2021, at Boston.\n\nJames Harden was a late scratch for the Clippers because of right shoulder soreness. But they got double-figure scoring from all five starters, including Sanders, whose points were a career high. Collins added 18 points and Kris Dunn had 16. Ivica Zubac had 11 rebounds.\n\nJimmy Butler added 24 points for the Warriors, who lost to the Clippers for the eighth straight time on the road.\n\nCurry fouled Dunn with 42 seconds left and the Warriors trailing 101-100 after Curry's back-to-back 3-pointers. Dunn made both free throws before Draymond Green scored in the lane to pull the Warriors within one.\n\nLeonard missed a jumper and the Warriors grabbed the defensive rebound. Butler missed a 16-footer before time expired.\n\nNeither team shot well from 3. The Clippers were 10 for 29, while the Warriors were 10 for 41.\n\nThe Warriors closed within four early in the fourth before the Clippers outscored them 16-7 to lead 94-81. Leonard scored six and Collins had five.\n\nGolden State ran off nine straight, including seven by Butler, to trail 94-90.\n\nGolden State had won six of eight coming into what was a playoff-like atmosphere that included rapper Snoop Dogg doing commentary for the game streamed on Peacock. It was a matchup of the NBA's two oldest teams. The average age of the Clippers' roster is 30.0 to 29.6 for the Warriors.\n\nGreen dove for a loose ball and crashed into his team's bench late in the first half. The team said he sustained a rib contusion, but he remained in the game. Green had 12 assists while going 0 of 6 from 3-point range.\n\nWarriors: Host the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday in the opener of an eight-game homestand.\n\nClippers: Visit the New York Knicks on Wednesday to open a three-game Eastern trip.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",

After that moment, I became a different player. I learned so much.\n\n\"If I am feeling great and I can get through this week and perform at the Australian Open ... people are paying good money to be there. If I can't give them the Kyrgios experience I would genuinely rather give it to someone that earned the wildcard and is in tip-top shape to start off something special in their career.\"\n\nIt wasn't a good sign for Kyrgios being beaten fairly easily by Kovacevic, who is a 27-year-old journeyman.\n\nIf it was just rust and lack of match fitness, Kyrgios still has time to get his game ready for the Australian Open with an appearance scheduled at the Kooyong Classic.\n\nBut after playing only six professional matches since being struck down with wrist and knee injuries in 2022, it's hard to believe we will ever see Kyrgios at his best again.\n\nThe best of Kyrgios - that we are likely to see again - is on the doubles court with Thanasi Kokkinakis or in the commentary box.",

    "fullText": "Knicks owner crushes dreams of fans hoping for Giannis Antetokounmpo trade originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNew York Knicks fans hoping that the team will trade for disgruntled Milwaukee Bucks star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo will be disappointed by recent comments from Knicks owner James Dolan.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on The Carton Show, Dolan said that the organization is very happy with the roster as currently constructed and doesn’t see any major moves on the horizon.\n\n“We love our team right now. They have chemistry. They all like each other,” Dolan said. “I’ve never seen a locker room more copacetic. There’s a lot of energy in there. Leon [Rose] can always overrule me, but I don’t see us making a big change. This group can win a championship. I believe that.”\n\nLast year, the Knicks made it to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 2000, and they're looking to improve upon that finish this season. Dolan seems to believe that health and continuity is what the Knicks need to take the next step, not a major shakeup.\n\n“Look how far we got with our group last year,” Dolan said. “Then take a look at who was playing and who wasn’t. We had injuries. Now we’re going into the second half of the season with more depth. If we stay healthy, we’ll go into the playoffs in much better condition.”\n\nThe trade deadline is about a month away, and New York has been frequently mentioned as a potential landing spot for Antetokounmpo. But, if Dolan is to be taken at his word, that won’t be happening any time soon.\n\nPerhaps if the Knicks have an early exit from the postseason, Dolan could change his stance regarding the roster over the offseason. But for now, Knicks fans shouldn’t hold their breath for an Antetokounmpo trade.\n\nNew York Knicks owner shares harsh criticism of Tom Thibodeau\n\nJames Dolan explains why Knicks won't hang NBA Cup banner",

    "description": "Missing K League already? The 2026 season will be one to savour, partly because of some changes that are coming in 2027. The 2026 season will be the last of a 12-team K League 1 and will see the end ...",
    "fullText": "Missing K League already? The 2026 season will be one to savour, partly because of some changes that are coming in 2027.\n\nThe 2026 season will be the last of a 12-team K League 1 and will see the end of the split, Final A and Final B system. From 2027, K League 1 will have 14 teams with three round robins. It is the end of an era. The split system came into effect in 2012 in what was a 16-team K League 1, then a 14-team division in 2013, before becoming the 12-team league it is today the following year.\n\nKicking things off when the weather is still extremely chilly, February 21st will see Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors host Daejeon Hana Citizen in K League's first Super Cup since 2006. Jeonbuk have won the Super Cup once and finished runners-up twice, while Daejeon finished runners-up in 2002 in their only appearance. The season curtain raiser will see the K League 1 champions host the Korea Cup winners, or in the event of a team doing the double, the league champions will host the runners-up instead.\n\nSpeaking of cups, the Korea Cup is switching to an autumn-spring format from 2026, with Round 1 through the Round of 16 (Round 4) to take place in July and August 2026, with the quarterfinals through the final held in May and June 2027. The change, the KFA says, is intended to better align with the AFC Champions League schedule and broader international football trends, while also enabling clubs to field their strongest squads in both the K League and the Korea Cup.\n\nSpeaking of eras ending. After five years in Gimcheon, the army team is leaving. With the affiliation agreement between the K League, the Korea Armed Forces Athletic Corps (Sangmu), and Gimcheon City set to expire at the end of 2026, it has been decided that if Gimcheon City establishes a citizen-owned club, or if the Armed Forces Athletic Corps establishes a new club in a different home city and either side enters the K League from 2027, both clubs will compete in K League 2. In short, regardless of where Gimcheon finish in 2026, they will be relegated to K League 2. It is currently unclear what the army team's plans are in terms of a new home, and indeed whether the city of Gimcheon will create a citizen club.\n\nThe Gimcheon situation, coupled with an expanded K League 1 from 2027, means that the promotion and relegation system will look a bit different. There will be three guaranteed promotion spots in 2026, but how this will play out depends on where Gimcheon finish in the league standings.\n\nIf Gimcheon Sangmu finish 12th, only Gimcheon Sangmu are relegated and K League 2’s top two teams will be automatically promoted. The teams finishing third to sixth enter a four-team playoff, with the winner promoted to mean three up. No Promotion–Relegation Playoff with a K League 1 team will be held.\n\nHowever, if Gimcheon Sangmu do not finish 12th, they are relegated regardless, but the team finishing 12th in K League 1 enters a Promotion–Relegation Playoff. K League 2’s top two-placed teams gain automatic promotion. The third to sixth-placed teams in K League 2 compete in a four-team playoff. The team that wins the promotion decider faces the K League 1 bottom side in the Promotion–Relegation Playoff.\n\nFor the first time since the early 2000s, K League teams will be allowed to sign foreign goalkeepers. A ban was put in place in order to help nuture goalkeepers for the national team, and there had long been calls for the ban to be lifted with the Taeguk Warriors in plenty of reliable custodians. Yongin FC became the first K League team to sign a foreign goalkeeper, acquiring Portuguese stopper Emanuel Novo.\n\nThe ban on foreign goalkeepers comes with a sort of complete lifting of foreign player restrictions. Clubs will now be able to sign as many foreign players as they wish, with five able to be on the pitch at the same time, up from four. The move is seen as a way of helping K League clubs stay competitive in AFC Champions League following the AFC's move to completely scrap the foreign player quota. In K League 2, the rule will remain the same: a maximum of four foreign players on the field at any one time.\n\nThe number of players allowed on the K League 2 matchday squad will increase from 18 to a maximum of 20. This change is intended to increase flexibility in the use of substitutes, improve overall match performance, and ensure playing opportunities for domestic players following the expansion of the foreign player registration quota. K League 1 has been operating with 20-player matchday squads since the 2024 season.\n\nThe often-abused and merely circumvented U22 player rule, whereby teams must start a player under the age of 22 and name another on the bench to be able to make five substitutions, has been scrapped in K League 1. However, at least two U22 players must still be named in the 20-man matchday squad. If only one U22 player is listed, the squad will be reduced to 19 players; if none are included, it will be limited to 18. The rule remains in place as it was in K League 2 meaning, in theory, young players should get more first-team opportunities in the second tier from 2026 onwards.\n\nFor only the third time ever, K League 1 will have a team brand new to the top tier. Bucheon FC 1995's promotion via the playoffs earned the Reds a spot in K League 1 for the very first time, following Suwon FC in 2015 and FC Anyang in 2024. Suwon last just a season before going straight back down again, but Anyang survived in 2025; how will Bucheon do?\n\nThere will be three new teams joining K League 2 to make a 17-team division: Paju Frontier, Gimhae FC 2008, and Yongin FC, two teams in Gyeonggi Province and one in the southeast.\n\nPaju Frontier, initially named Paju Citizen, were formed in 2012 and spent the last five seasons in K3, finishing 10th last year. Yongin FC are technically a brand new club, founded this year, but have K League landed Lee Dong-gook as technical director and have already signed some big names. Gimhae FC 2008 were founded in, yes, you guessed it, 2008, and actually finished top of K3 last year, clinching their second K3 title, having also won it in 2020.",

    "description": "Raich Carter led the Lads to a famous FA Cup final victory in 1937. But Sunderland had another captain — every bit as much a hero as the man whose mural proudly looks down from the Blue House pub in his home town of Hendon.",
    "fullText": "The name Raich Carter is firmly embedded within the lore of Sunderland AFC and the hearts and minds of its followers.\n\nA son of Hendon, he was the local lad come good – a one-goal-every-two-games inside-forward who would lead the club to league and cup glory in the late 1930s and who is still, to this day, one of the youngest-ever captains to lead a side to top-flight English success. Having led the club to the English First Division in 1936 – that is the Premier League in old money for the millennial masses – he was then presented with the prospect of leading the side out at Wembley the following year in the FA Cup Final.\n\nMillwall had been successfully overcome in the semi-final three weeks earlier, with Sunderland showing the resilience to come from behind. The final whistle at Leeds Road, Huddersfield, brought the typical emotions – the elation that comes with success in such settings and, of course, the anticipation of the weeks ahead and the looming date with destiny as Sunderland aspired to return to Wearside laden with silverware.\n\nThe fortitude shown to come from behind would again be evident during English football’s end-of-season showpiece on 1st May as Preston, ahead at half-time, succumbed to the Wearside warriors in the second half, with Raich Carter amongst the goalscorers.\n\nBut Sunderland had another captain in 1937 — every bit as much a hero as the man whose mural proudly looks down from the Blue House pub in his home town of Hendon. Arguably more so.\n\nCaptain Frederick Robinson would have celebrated each FA Cup tie being won as much as anyone, but by the time Sunderland headed to Yorkshire in the hope Wembley was soon to follow, the focus of Captain Robinson, bred in the Barnes area, was on an upcoming journey that had more than memories and medals at stake.\n\nIn an increasingly polarised continent, Europe was coming to terms with the political phenomenon of fascism. Whilst some of its ingredients were hardly novel, the idea of absolutism and othering communities had been adequately packaged and presented with its symbology a nod to Roman history.\n\nThe adherence to such ideology had found allure, with Germany, Italy, and Spain the notable victims as an antithesis to the democratic will of the people became evident. In the latter, Spain, the 1936 election won by the Popular Front was both disputed and dismissed by Franco and his sycophants.\n\nA fascist disputing the electoral endorsement of the people. Wouldn’t happen now, eh…\n\nThe ensuing civil discord, carefully crafted by Franco, brought about the Spanish Civil War and, for the Spanish people, the demise of parliamentary democracy for four decades.\n\nBut some would not stand idly by. Not merely the Spanish people but ordinary decent people beyond Iberian borders.\n\nOne such individual was our very own Frederick Robinson. And by the time Sunderland and Preston were engaged in battle at Wembley he, with others from Sunderland, the wider North-East, and beyond, was the captain of the SS Knitsley as it made its way to Spain to bring aid to the beleaguered Basque people. Despite the trepidation of what lay ahead, on 1st May 1937 the crew of the ship had, temporarily, other matters to focus on.\n\nSunderland, their home-town club, were at Wembley, and for several hours these local heroes, part of what we know now as the International Brigade, were able to use the ship’s radio to keep abreast of how events were unfolding in London.\n\nThey celebrated. Briefly. Before long emotions were balanced and the precarious nature of their mission realised.\n\nSome made it to Spain. Some did not. Some took down aid whilst others took up arms. All to fight on behalf of the poor and disenfranchised. Their humanity and heroism is not diluted by the outcome of the conflict; it lies in their willingness to confront evil and the preparedness to make the final sacrifice if needed.\n\nThey are memorialised across modern Spain, from street name to statue, from plaque to plaza.\n\nThere is, however, no fitting memory or memorial to Captain Robinson and others from Sunderland within Wearside.\n\nIncredibly, if you want to see the inscribed names of those from Sunderland who fought Franco and fascism you have to go to the garden and grounds of Newcastle Civic Centre.\n\nThat, however, is about to change. With the assistance of the community that reared such heroes.\n\nSolidarity Sunderland are in the process of trying to ensure that those who, as the oft-espoused football chant says, were “one of our own” can have their voices heard and story told through a public memorial that accurately reflects their demonstrable opposition to the social disharmony and destruction of political poison.\n\nIf every second Saturday you go to the Stadium of Light to support a footballing International Brigade – all colours, creeds, and nationalities – then surely we can honour the local volunteers who were part of one that had so much more to lose than a football match.\n\nGet involved – your time and input can prove as invaluable as any financial contribution.\n\nFind out more at https://solidaritypark.com/solidarity-sunderland/\n\nPlease contact – solidaritysunderland@gmail.com",

    "description": "You felt that if the game had gone on for another ten minutes we might have sneaked a winner, but a point in the circumstances is still a more than satisfactory result which made the dreaded return to work on Monday a slightly less depressing prospect.",
    "fullText": "In his epic poem The Waste Land, T.S. Eliot remarked that April is the cruellest month, but I doubt he ever had to face up to three away games in six days at the beginning of January. At any other time of year the prospect of three back-to-back trips to new stadia within six days would be the stuff of dreams for a travelling fan, but straight after Christmas when everyone is skint, freezing, and/or wrestling with attempts at self-improvement, it almost seemed like a cruel joke.\n\nStill, at least those of us lucky enough to already be based in the capital wouldn’t have to face up to a lengthy car journey or risk putting our fate in the hands of Network Rail. Our first trip to the imaginatively named Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was earmarked by many fans back when the fixtures were released, and enthusiasm was high despite the annoying Sunday kick-off.\n\nThe blue-and-white side of North London have really taken their trademark “Spursiness” to new levels this season, boasting one of the best away records in the league while being incredibly generous in dishing out points at their shiny new home. A smug Mag mate of mine commented that the ground isn’t really “new” to most teams at this point, to which I gave the natural reply of “one-nil”.\n\nOur African absentees haven’t affected our results as dramatically as most commentators would have expected/hoped, so most Sunderland fans were reasonably confident of adding at least one point to our tally as we passed the halfway stage of the season.\n\nWith Spurs being the second-most convenient destination for me behind West Ham, I was excited to host some of our fellow fans who had travelled south for the game at my local in Walthamstow, only to be embarrassed to learn that (contrary to its Google Maps entry) the doors would only open at 11 a.m. rather than at ten. Thankfully we didn’t have to wait too long in the cold, and a few early ales set the tone for the day. We swiftly moved on to the Antwerp Arms, which had a healthy mix of home and away fans congregating under the watchful eye of a hi-vis-clad security guard with a megaphone. This seemed a bit excessive for a pub, but I suppose you can never be too careful.\n\nAfter entering the ground we basked in the spacious and well-stocked concourse, taking a moment to reflect on just how many light years away the whole matchday experience was from Accrington, Fleetwood et al. The view from our seats in the lower tier didn’t actually encompass the whole pitch, but thankfully the huge screens on each corner of the ground meant we could keep abreast of the action.\n\nUnfortunately not much of it was down at the end Sunderland were attacking as the team served up one of the least inspiring performances of the season so far. A better side than Spurs could have really taken us to the sword, and the statuesque marking for Ben Davies’ opener seemed to unfold in slow motion.\n\nThe lethargy on the pitch was sadly matched by a subdued atmosphere in the away end. Far be it from me to say how anyone should conduct themselves at the match, but the players and coach have commented repeatedly on how much the passion and noise from the fans helps to drive the team on, so it was disappointing that many supporters weren’t able to provide more vocal backing to the team in the first half, especially given the excellent season we’ve enjoyed to date.\n\nThankfully there was a marked improvement on and off the pitch in the second half. The introduction of Ballard added some much-needed balance to our play, and when an excellent move was lashed home by Brobbey the away end sparked into raptures. You felt that if the game had gone on for another ten minutes we might have sneaked a winner, but a point in the circumstances is still a more than satisfactory result which made the dreaded return to work on Monday a slightly less depressing prospect. One down, three to go…",

    "description": "Now fully submerged into the infamously hectic winter schedule, I thought it appt to assess the main talking points",
    "fullText": "This period of the season has been at the forefront of every supporter’s mind since the start of the season, especially with the arrival of so many AFCON participants. It is a tough portion of the campaign for any team, never mind one with six first-team players unavailable.\n\nThe first yellow-card suspension line falls right in the middle and, with the increased demand on the players, injuries are common. So far we have dealt with this well.\n\nWe are unbeaten in the four games since AFCON started and since the fixtures started piling up. All four points were hard-fought and deserved, adding to our tally and keeping the ball rolling.\n\nHowever, this already difficult task may get a lot more difficult with two more games in the next six days.\n\nI love and believe in each and every player in our squad. They have all proved themselves to be brilliant, talented footballers who are prepared to leave everything out on the pitch for our club. That being said, they are only human – they don’t run on rechargeable double-A batteries. With our list of unavailable players, Le Bris’ team selection is almost forced. This was epitomised by a message someone sent into the Spurs match radio reaction on BBC. It was along the lines of “we looked very tired in that first half – why isn’t RLB rotating?”. Gary Bennett’s response was truthful and, in my opinion, correct – Do you really want anyone on the bench to be starting?\n\nPersonally I would not want O’Nien, Neil, or Hjelde to be in a starting eleven. Mundle and Rigg are capable, but I don’t think either of them have done enough to displace Mayenda or Adingra. As the season has progressed we have proven ourselves to be able to compete with anyone in this league, so deciding to drop any of the starting eleven for any of those bench players I have mentioned seems ridiculous. Every game provides an opportunity to get more points on the board, and not using the best eleven available greatly reduces the quality of the team and our chances of success.\n\nI know that it is unsustainable to start the same eleven players every game, but the bench seems so weak now that I don’t see an alternative. We give ourselves another issue by playing both Mayenda and Brobbey. Normally one would start and the other would replace them. This issue was exacerbated by Wilson Isidor being out against Tottenham. It is described as a minor injury by Régis, who hopes that he will be available against Brentford, so that is a relief.\n\nLooking ahead, some of our African stars could be returning soon. As I am writing this, Morocco and Talbi, as well as Senegal and Diarra, have qualified, but Mozambique, DR Congo, and Burkina Faso are yet to play. Hopefully they all lose and can return sooner rather than later. Even if they do lose though, they will still not be available for the midweek game against Brentford.\n\nAnother trip to London beckons on Wednesday. We beat Brentford in the reverse fixture, but they have proved to be a very capable team in recent weeks. They have an in-form striker and a well-established, difficult-to-play-against tactic. It will be another tough game and one in which the effects of this chock-a-block schedule could be clear.\n\nAfter that the FA Cup takes us to Merseyside with a first-ever trip to the Hill Dickinson Arena on the cards, and over 7,000 Mackems will follow the Lads west. This is the chance to rotate that we have been looking for, but might be slightly disappointing for the fans taking this expensive trip to Everton (just after Christmas as well) to see a second-choice team play. Regardless, I am sure that the supporters will understand and be grateful that we have this chance to give the rest of the Lads a break. It will be nice to visit this new stadium and see some of the players that helped us get into the Premier League in action.\n\nOverall this demanding period of the season is a difficult problem to navigate, but one in which we have traversed well so far. There are still a few games to go in this overloaded programme, but hopefully we get through it unscathed and with our players returning from Africa soon.",

    "title": "Can Sunderland Women Continue To Find Home Comforts At Eppleton?",
    "description": "Charlotte Patterson looks at whether Hetton is where the Lasses should be — or whether things could change in the future",
    "fullText": "The question of where Sunderland AFC Women should call “home? isn’t simply about bricks, grass and turnstiles.\n\nInstead, it cuts right to the heart of what the women’s team is, who it’s for, and how seriously the club and the wider footballing world are prepared to take it.\n\nIn recent years, as the Lasses have reestablished themselves in the upper tiers of the pyramid and the women’s game has gathered momentum nationally, the suitability of Eppleton Colliery Welfare Ground has come under increasing scrutiny.\n\nOn paper, the club’s women’s side belongs to a major football institution with a 49,000‑seat stadium on the banks of the Wear. In practice, they’re based at a 2,500‑capacity ground in Hetton‑le‑Hole, with all the charm and complications that entails.\n\nTo understand whether Eppleton remains the right home, it’s necessary to overlook nostalgia and frustration and look squarely at what the ground offers, what it lacks, and what it symbolises. Geography, transport, parking, amenities, attendances, atmosphere, the tactical realities of the pitch and the alternative represented by the Stadium of Light all need to be weighed together.\n\nTwo to three years ago, I wrote a similar article years ago on what keeps fans away from watching the Lasses at Eppleton. It spoke to many of issues such as awkward Sunday kick offs, cost‑of‑living pressure, low‑key marketing and the simple difficulty of getting to Hetton if you don’t live nearby.\n\nThose themes still ring true, but the picture has shifted slightly as the game has grown and as the club has experimented more with games at the Stadium of Light.\n\nEppleton’s geographical location is both part of its appeal and part of its problem. Hetton is steeped in mining heritage and working‑class identity — and Eppleton Colliery Welfare Ground is exactly the kind of place where football feels knitted into the life of a community rather than sitting apart from it.\n\nFor longtime supporters, the ground carries memories of youth games, local ties, and a sense that the Lasses are still closely connected to the roots of the region.\n\nSunderland Women aren’t tucked away in an anonymous training complex — they’re visible in a town that understands graft, resilience and collective pride. That creates a sense of authenticity which many supporters cherish, and particularly those who feel somewhat alienated by the commercialism of the top end of the men’s game.\n\nHowever, what feels local and rooted to one person can feel remote and inconvenient to another.\n\nThe very fact that Eppleton is in Hetton rather than the centre of Sunderland makes it awkward for a significant chunk of the potential audience. There’s no Metro stop, no easy stroll from the city centre and no simple hop from Shields, Newcastle or Durham. For supporters without a car — particularly younger fans or families who might be bringing children to their first women’s game — the journey can seem like more work than it’s worth.\n\nSunday afternoon fixtures, often with early or slightly odd kick off times dictated by broadcasts or scheduling, can make it even harder to justify the trip, especially in winter when daylight is short and the North East weather isn’t exactly welcoming.\n\nPublic transport does technically exist, but it doesn’t operate with the frequency or convenience that turns a matchday into an easy habit. Buses run, but not on a pattern designed around football crowds, and the walk from stop to the ground isn’t always obvious if you don’t know the area.\n\nFor a committed core, this is all just part of the routine: you plan, you drive, you share lifts and you work it out.\n\nFor the more casual or curious supporter — the person the women’s game needs to attract to grow beyond its hard core — these frictions stack up. None of them are individually insurmountable. Together, they form a quiet, persistent deterrent.\n\nParking is a good example of that cumulative effect.\n\nEppleton doesn’t have the parking infrastructure of a major stadium — and it was never designed to. Matchdays often involve a slightly improvised dance of cars dotting around local streets, shared car parks and patchwork solutions.\n\nLocals tend to be tolerant, and there’s a kind of grassroots charm in seeing ordinary estates absorb the matchday traffic in the way they have for decades at non‑league grounds across the country. But for visitors or for those who arrive later than planned, it can be stressful and confusing. Bigger games only amplify the issue, as more cars arrive than the immediate area can comfortably absorb.\n\nIn contrast, the Stadium of Light is built to usher tens of thousands in and out with relative efficiency.\n\nMultiple official car parks, stewarding, signage and a road network moulded around Premier League‑era crowds mean that even a modest turnout for a women’s fixture benefits from that infrastructure.\n\nCombined with the Stadium of Light Metro station and strong public transport links, it delivers a smoother, more predictable logistical experience from front door to seat and back again. That kind of reliability matters — especially for families, disabled supporters and those travelling from outside Sunderland — and it’s one of the clearest areas where the big stadium is objectively superior.\n\nAmenities tell a similar story.\n\nEppleton offers what you would expect of a small, traditional football ground: toilets, a small food hut, limited indoor space and a basic but functional seated stand. For regulars, this suffices. They know what they’re getting, they dress for the weather and they accept that this isn’t a Premier League experience.\n\nHowever, as the women’s game increasingly pitches itself as a family‑friendly day out and as rival clubs invest in their fan experience, Eppleton’s limitations become more glaring. If you’ve queued in cold rain for a single food outlet with limited choice or tried to juggle a coffee, a child and a programme without anywhere to take shelter, you immediately feel the gap between aspiration and reality.\n\nThe Stadium of Light, of course, was purpose‑built for a very different scale.\n\nMultiple kiosks, covered concourses, accessible toilets, proper hospitality spaces and comfortable seating make the matchday feel more polished. It’s easier to get a drink, easier to buy food, and easier to keep warm and mostly dry in miserable weather. For someone attending their first women’s match, it offers an experience that says “big club” — and that matters at a time when visibility, optics and perceived seriousness are central to how women’s football is judged.\n\nYet that strength comes with a paradox: the infrastructure impresses, but if the stands are sparse and the noise is thin, the overall impression can still feel underwhelming or even sad.\n\nThis is where attendance and atmosphere intersect in complicated ways.\n\nOn the face of it, the growth of crowds for women’s football in England is one of the game’s success stories. We have seen record‑breaking attendances in the WSL and WSL2, including the at the Wear-Tyne/Tyne-Wear derby at the Stadium of Light (an attendance of 15,387 last season) and St James’s Park (38,502 last season and 18,972  this season). Those headline numbers show what is possible in the right circumstances: local rivalry, strong marketing, a big stadium, and a sense of occasion.\n\nHowever, those “spike events” don’t reflect the reality of week‑to‑week football at Eppleton, as Sunderland Women typically attract crowds measured in the high hundreds at best, and low hundreds at worst.\n\nEppleton’s 2,500 capacity — with just 250 seats — means that a turnout which would look completely lost at the Stadium of Light can feel warm and alive in Hetton. When 800 or 1,200 people are gathered tightly around the pitch, the sound collects and carries. You feel every shout, hear every instruction, and sense the emotional texture of the game.\n\nThat intimacy is one of the defining qualities of women’s football and a big part of what draws people back. The players can hear individual voices, recognise regulars, and feel tangibly supported even when the numbers are modest.\n\nMove that same crowd into a 49,000‑seat bowl and the arithmetic of atmosphere turns against you.\n\nThe singing sections might do their best, but the sound dissipates into empty tiers of red plastic and the camera pans across swathes of unoccupied seats. What felt like a healthy, noisy and committed crowd at Eppleton suddenly looks anaemic and isolated. This isn’t because the fans have become any less passionate — it’s because the scale of the environment dwarfs them and in terms of pure atmosphere per person, Eppleton wins hands down.\n\nThe psychological effect on players shouldn’t be underestimated either.\n\nAt Eppleton, the pitch is tight, the supporters are close, and the environment feels manageable, almost personal. The Lasses know every blade of grass, every echo and every sightline.\n\nVisiting teams often comment on how awkward and intense it can be to play there — and that isn’t an accident. Sunderland’s women have historically built their identity on organisation, work rate and intensity, pressing hard, working in tight units and transitioning quickly, and so a more compact pitch allows those strengths to surface more naturally.\n\nThe Stadium of Light, meanwhile, offers a pitch closer to the standard of the elite men’s game: wide, long, demanding physical range and positional discipline in larger spaces.\n\nIt’s not that women can’t or shouldn’t play on such a surface, as many top women’s sides do so brilliantly. But the reality is that the squad depth, conditioning and tactical patterns in the WSL2 aren’t always perfectly tuned to that scale and Sunderland have sometimes looked stretched there, both physically and mentally.\n\nWhen the ball is on the far side of the pitch; when the crowd noise is diffused and when runs have to cover an extra few yards every time, the burden can tell. The Lasses often seem to struggle on the big pitch of the Stadium of Light, and that impression is widely shared among fans who’ve watched them in both venues.\n\nThe pitch isn’t the only thing that changes inside a stadium — the expectations do as well.\n\nPlayers talk about feeling the difference of walking out of a tunnel into a huge bowl they share with the men’s team. It can be inspiring, but it can also be intimidating and emotionally draining if the stands are only sparsely populated. The same space that’s electric when 40,000 roar can feel eerily quiet when there are a couple of thousand dotted around. You sense the ghosts of what the stadium could be, and that can weigh on a team trying to play its best and most instinctive football.\n\nHowever, none of this means that the Stadium of Light should be rejected out of hand as it remains a powerful symbol of ambition and parity, and when Sunderland Women step onto that pitch, under that roof and in front of that crest, the optics are clear: this club takes its women’s side seriously enough to put them on the main stage.\n\nMajor events such as a Wear-Tyne derby, a promotion push or a cup tie against a big name deserve and benefit from that setting. Record‑chasing attendances at the Stadium of Light don’t just generate nice headlines — they create memories for supporters and players that Eppleton, with all its character, simply can’t.\n\nThe question, then, isn’t “Eppleton or the Stadium of Light, now and forever?” but “How do we balance what each offers at this stage of the journey?”\n\nEppleton supplies week‑to‑week atmosphere, a pitch that suits the team, and continuity of identity, whereas the Stadium of Light supplies infrastructure, visibility, and a platform for growth.\n\nThere are very real barriers that keep fans away from Eppleton — including the cost and time of travel, competing weekend duties, limited marketing and a lingering sense that women’s fixtures are somewhat peripheral compared to the men’s programme.\n\nMost of those factors are still in play but what’s changed is that we now have more evidence of what can be achieved when the women’s team is placed front and centre at the main stadium with a proper promotional push.\n\nCrucially, though, those big events don’t automatically translate into consistent attendance growth, and someone who turns up for a record‑breaking derby may not be prepared to trek to Hetton for a mid‑table clash in the wind and rain.\n\nThat’s not necessarily a failure — it’s just a reminder that the pathways to being a regular fan of Sunderland Women are varied. Some will be drawn in through the Stadium of Light spectacle and then gradually discover Eppleton’s raw charm, and others will always prefer the intimacy of Hetton and the feeling that they’re part of a tight‑knit community and not just one face among thousands.\n\nThere is also a structural reality at play.\n\nSunderland Women remain part of a club operating within financial constraints, navigating the complicated economics of both men’s and women’s football. Opening the Stadium of Light is expensive; staffing, stewarding, utilities and operational costs all rise, and for a typical WSL2 fixture, the sums may simply not make sense unless a certain attendance threshold is realistically achievable.\n\nEppleton, in contrast, is far cheaper to operate and easier to fit around training schedules and day‑to‑day logistics. Any conversation about moving the women’s team permanently to the Stadium of Light has to grapple honestly with those financial and practical considerations — particularly given the men play there also and it would require much more ground maintenance and work to be completed.\n\nBeyond the numbers, there’s also the question of what “home” actually feels like.\n\nEppleton is where the Lasses have earned promotions, endured difficult seasons, and rebuilt. It’s where young fans have waited at the barriers for selfies and autographs and where families have grown into the habit of making that slightly awkward trip, because once you’re inside, everything feels close, human and real.\n\nThat kind of emotional capital simply can’t be transplanted overnight. The Stadium of Light has the potential to become that kind of home if the women were to play there regularly, but it would take time, patience and consistent investment in matchday experience — not just sporadic showcase games.\n\nThe most realistic and constructive way forward — at least in the medium term — lies in embracing a “hybrid model” with honesty rather than embarrassment.\n\nEppleton can remain the beating heart of Sunderland Women, the place where regular league fixtures are contested on a pitch that suits the team and in front of a crowd that feels present and loud. The Stadium of Light can be used strategically: for derbies, promotion six‑pointers, family‑themed events in school holidays and fixtures chosen to coincide with wider club campaigns.\n\nOver time, as the core audience grows and the club’s capacity to market and support the women’s programme expands, the balance could tip naturally toward more games at the big stadium — and that evolution would feel earned rather than imposed.\n\nSeen in that light, the advantages and disadvantages of Eppleton become less about right versus wrong and more about fit versus aspiration.\n\nIts location, parking, amenities and accessibility do hold the team back from reaching some supporters who might otherwise come along. Yet it’s also the place where the women’s side currently looks and feels most like itself: compact, combative, close to its people. The Stadium of Light, meanwhile, is the future horizon, a venue that matches the scale of Sunderland’s name and the ambition of the women’s game, but which can still feel too big for where things are, week in, week out.\n\nIn the end, the real task isn’t simply to choose a ground, but to build a culture that makes either venue genuinely feel alive.\n\nBetter promotion, clearer information about travel and parking, coordinated lifts and coach schemes from the city centre, stronger links with schools and community groups in both Sunderland and Hetton, and visible, consistent messaging from the club that the women’s team are central to its identity. These things matter just as much as bricks and seats — and if those foundations are laid, Eppleton and the Stadium of Light stop being opposing options and instead become two different stages on the same journey.\n\nFor now, Eppleton remains both a blessing and a constraint. It’s awkward to reach but rewarding once you arrive. It lacks polish but offers connection. It does not scream ambition, but it whispers something more important: that football can still belong to ordinary people in ordinary places, even as it strives to grow.\n\nWhatever the future holds and whether Sunderland AFC Women eventually take up permanent residence at the Stadium of Light or a new solution emerges, Eppleton will remain a vital chapter in their story — the small ground in Hetton where the Lasses kept going, kept competing, and kept inviting people in even when so many forces conspired to keep them away.\n\nAll of this comes with an important caveat, one that’s essential to state clearly: this article hasn’t been written to shame anyone, guilt trip anyone or imply that supporters “should” be attending women’s matches.\n\nFootball fandom is deeply personal, shaped by time, money, geography, habit, identity and emotional bandwidth. People support what they can, when they can, and in ways that make sense for their own lives.\n\nThe intention here isn’t to push an agenda or to suggest that those who don’t attend games any Eppleton are somehow “lesser” supporters. Instead, the aim is to understand the barriers and to consider what might realistically help those who are curious, interested or on the fence as they consider whether to take that next step and give the women’s game a try.\n\nThat distinction matters, because the conversation around women’s football can sometimes slip into moralising — as if attendance is a test of virtue rather than a choice shaped by practical realities.\n\nSunderland supporters are among the most loyal and emotionally invested in the country, but loyalty doesn’t magically overcome bus timetables, childcare, shift work, tight budgets or the simple fact that Hetton isn’t easy to reach. Recognising those realities is not an excuse; instead, it’s the starting point for meaningful improvement.\n\nIf the club wants to grow the women’s fanbase, it must meet people where they are, not where we wish they were, and to their credit, some steps have already been taken.\n\nOne of the most visible improvements at Eppleton has been the upgraded TV gantry, which has significantly improved the quality of live streams and broadcast footage. This might seem like a small detail, but it matters, as better coverage increases visibility, helps to attract new supporters and gives the players the professional platform they deserve. It also signals that the club is willing to invest in the infrastructure around the women’s team — not just the bare minimum required to host matches.\n\nSupporters themselves have also stepped up in ways that deserve recognition.\n\nThe Sunderland Women Supporters Group has spent its own money on flags, banners and visual displays to decorate Eppleton and create a more vibrant, welcoming matchday environment.\n\nThese efforts aren’t cosmetic — they contribute to atmosphere, identity and pride. They make the ground feel lived‑in and loved, and they show new supporters that this is a team with a community behind it. In many ways, the SWSG’s work embodies the spirit of women’s football: grassroots, collaborative, and driven by passion rather than profit.\n\nUltimately, the question of Eppleton versus the Stadium of Light is not a binary choice but a spectrum of possibilities.\n\nThe women’s team doesn’t need to abandon its roots to embrace its future, and nor does it need to cling to tradition at the expense of ambition. What it needs — and what the supporters deserve — is a thoughtful, realistic plan that respects the unique strengths of both venues while addressing the barriers that keep potential fans away.\n\nEppleton will always be part of the story, but it doesn’t have to be the whole story forever.\n\nFor now, the task is simple: make it easier for people to come, make it enjoyable when they do, and make them feel part of something that matters. If the club can do that, with the help of supporters, volunteers, and the wider community, then the question of where Sunderland AFC Women play will eventually answer itself.\n\nGrowth will come not from pressure or guilt, but from connection, curiosity and the quiet, steady pull of a team worth supporting.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are considering appointing a young manager from the Portuguese league to replace Ruben Amorim as INEOS risk learning nothing from the past 14 months, according to a bombshell report.\n\nThe Red Devils dismissed Amorim this morning after internal tensions between with executive branch spilled out into the public following the 1-1 draw with Leeds United.\n\nThe Portuguese coach made his position at Old Trafford untenable after publicly criticising the club – with director of football Jason Wilcox receiving the brunt of his anger.\n\nWith a dreadful record on the pitch, and mounting difficulties off it, INEOS were left with no other decision than to sack Amorim, despite having steadfastly backed him since arrival from Sporting CP.\n\nDarren Fletcher – a former Red Devil and current Under-18’s manager – has taken over the senior side on an interim basis, while a permanent caretaker is sourced to lead the side for the remainder of the season.\n\nBut the search for a long-term replacement for Amorim is already well underway, with host of candidates – inside and outside England – under consideration.\n\nAnd, an an ironic twist, The Telegraph reveals one of the targets is Francisco Farioli – the 36-year-old tactician from Liga Portugal, currently in charge of Porto.\n\nThough Farioli is Italian, he offers many parallels with the coach he would be succeeding in Manchester.\n\nHe is a young manager with a clear philosophy predicated on a high-press and forcing transitions. He is inexperienced, yet confident, with only one season in a top five European league – in charge of OGC Nice in another ironic twist, given INEOS retain sporting control of the Ligue 1 side as well.\n\nTotal Football Analysis explains how the 36-year-old has lifted Porto to the summit of Portuese football.\n\n“Under Farioli tactics, Porto have transformed their build-up from the back into a more structured, positional process.\n\n“The goalkeeper and centre-backs are involved early, with the pivot (No. 6) often dropping between the central defenders to form a back three and create numerical superiority in the first phase of possession, or when one of the full-backs stops with two centre-backs.”\n\nThis is distinct from Amorim’s system – but the parallels of appointing a young coach with virtually no experience at the top level or a familiarity with the rigours of English football should be obvious for United’s rulers.\n\nYet the allure remains, despite the cautionary tale already having played out.\n\nPorto sit atop Liga Portugal without having lost a game (16 wins and one draw). They have scored 34 goals while conceding just four times – a staggering record at the halfway mark of a season. The Dragons are through to the quarter final of the Taça de Portugal and are on track for automatic qualification from the Europa League group phase.\n\nIn short, it has been an outstanding season for a coach in his first season in a new league. Though it is balanced by his previous campaign last year with Ajax, where the Dutch giants surrendered the title to PSV Eindhoven in a heart-breaking final weekend of the Eredivisie.\n\nBut, overall, it’s simply not enough for Farioli to a serious contender to replace Amorim at Old Trafford. It would be too much, too soon, for a coach who should continue his progression in Portugal.\n\nFeatured image Justin Setterfield via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "title": "On This Day (6th Jan 1951): Sunderland Show The Wright Stuff In The Cup!",
    "description": "It was FA Cup third round day at Roker, and Sunderland were keen to do well in the competition!",
    "fullText": "“Close, but not close enough” was the best way to describe Sunderland AFC’s relationship with the FA Cup during the 1950s.\n\nHaving spent boatloads of cash in trying to bring some of the biggest names in the game to Roker, the club were desperate to get their hands on some silverware in return for their investment, and during an era where the cup was arguably seen as the biggest prize of all, knockout football often became the main focus.\n\nCertain members of the team have since mused that it became such a priority that our league form slipped even when the title could’ve been within reach instead, and yet the most the Lads had to show for their efforts were concurrent semi-final appearances in 1955 and 1956.\n\nIt was often claimed that the expensively-assembled side of individuals — whilst boasting eye catching skills and capable of anything on their day — struggled to gel as a unit and was unable to produce any sort of consistency.\n\nThat was perhaps another reason why the FA Cup became the “holy grail”, and it was certainly the case that ties were sometimes viewed as the highlight of the season for supporters. Whether the opposition were familiar foes or unknown qualities from the lower divisions, crowds would still come in their droves and in 1950/1951 alone, Roker Park welcomed three 60,000+ cup gates in less than a month.\n\nThe campaign saw the Sunderland reach the sixth round — their best run since 1938 as holders of the trophy, and the two semi finals that came a couple of years later proved to be the furthest they got in the 1950s. Big numbers flocked in for showpiece games against Southampton, Norwich City and Wolverhampton Wanderers, but before that, the club needed to get past second division Coventry City in front of another healthy attendance.\n\nThe visit of the Sky Blues was only the second home draw since World War II, but they weren’t planning on rolling over for it and their preparations went down to the wire, with Coventry needing to wait as long as possible before naming their team due to a flu bug in the camp and future Sunderland striker Ken Chisholm being one of the men eventually deemed able to play.\n\nThe hosts also needed to get things in order, with rain and thawing frost making the pitch soft and boggy in parts, and in need of a healthy covering of peat moss in the goalmouths.\n\nCoventry more than matched Sunderland in the first half, although both sides struggled with the conditions and greasy ball, which led to some awkward slips and fumbles.\n\nThe two goalkeepers were often forced to punch crosses and shots away instead of attempting to catch them, whilst the referee — acknowledging the treacherous state of the surface — tried to overlook minor fouls in order to help keep the action flowing.\n\nIt all contributed to a frantic tempo and it was only after the break that Bill Murray’s men were able to gain an element of control and start putting their better technical ability to use.\n\nTommy Wright was a persistent threat and five minutes into the second half, he opened the scoring after beating two men on the wing, cutting inside and smashing in a powerful attempt on goal. Although blocked, it fell back to him on the rebound to convert off the underside of the bar and once in front, skipper Willie Watson was able to begin pulling the strings and force Coventry back.\n\nWith their defending becoming more ragged, it was hard for the visitors to get out of their own half and the desperation was never more apparent than with ten minutes to go, when a Dickie Davis header was handled by Terry Springthorpe in the penalty area.\n\nWright took the subsequent penalty and appeared to have struck it well, but the effort was still repelled by a magnificent save from Alf Wood. The stopper had been increasingly busy in the closing stages and deserved his moment of glory, although it wasn’t long until he was beaten again anyway, Arthur Wright doing the business this time as he drove the ball in from out wide.\n\nThere was a touch of fortune about the goal as Arthur Wright could’ve conceivably been looking to put the ball into a dangerous area, and it certainly took at least one deflection before finding its way over the line, but either way, the final score felt right on the balance of play.\n\nCoventry had by no means showed themselves up, but the Black Cats had grown stronger as things went on and were now in the hat for the eagerly anticipated next round.\n\nSunderland 2 (T. Wright 50’, A. Wright 87’)\n\nSunderland: Mapson, Hedley, Hudgell; Watson, Walsh, A Wright; T Wright, Davis, Ford; Broadis, Duns",

    "fullText": "Dozens of skaters have flocked to The Fens from far and wide after word got out that flooded fields had frozen over.\n\nCompetitive skating began in the watery landscape in 1879 and since then it has become a magnet for lovers of \"natural ice\".\n\nFen skating takes place when a field floods and then freezes over, so the ice is very shallow, in places just a few centimetres, unlike frozen lakes.\n\nPeter Riches, 24, a Team GBR short track skater who came from Nottingham to try out his blades at Welney, on the Norfolk/Cambridgeshire border, said: \"We all made the trip over - we all kind of flock here from various parts of the country.\"\n\nWord got out at the weekend that the Fens were freezing and with the cold snap due to last, many more are expected to make the pilgrimage to the wide open spaces.\n\nCompetitive skater Riches said: \"You just have to make sure that you respect the ice - I don't think you're ever going to tame the ice.\n\n\"You can go as fast as you like.\n\n\"This feels more natural, more organic. This is what I call real skating\n\n\"That's what the sport is all about; that's how it started; that's the tradition.\n\n\"It's a challenge, there are little obstacles you have to avoid, but as much as it's a challenge, it's more like a treat.\"\n\nCambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service has warned people to stay off frozen lakes after reports of youngsters playing on them at the weekend.\n\nHowever, those involved in skating on the Fenland fields are quick to point out how shallow the frozen water they use is.\n\n\"This is completely different to a lake,\" said Hew Williams, short track director at British Ice Skating.\n\n\"Here we've got naturally flooded farmland that's unique to this area of Britain and... there's no flowing water underneath. This is still water that's frozen and it needs to be frozen thick enough to actually be able to skate on.\n\n\"On lakes, on rivers, the speed of the water stops the ice from freezing thick enough so that's what's unique here.\"\n\nHe said the maximum depth of the water under the ice was about a foot, or shin-deep.\n\nLaura Upton drove to Welney from Wisbech in Cambridgshire with her two sons when she heard \"on the grapevine\" about the ice.\n\nHer father used to sell skates and she has been Fen skating for about 45 years, since she was five.\n\n\"We definitely have to make the most of it on a beautiful sunny day like today,\" she said.\n\n\"We used to roller speed-skate throughout the year to try to be ready for the ice when it used to come.\n\n\"It's great to keep the traditions going; it's a bit of a natural phenomenon and we're very lucky.\"\n\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.\n\nIn pictures: Snow in the East amid weather warning\n\nDo not play on frozen lakes, warns fire service\n\nSkaters make most of frozen fields\n\n'Fen skating is a great metaphor for life'\n\n'Miracle' black-tailed godwits fly home\n\nMigrating birds caught in cold snap",

    "description": "The organization planted seeds of doubt about the Browns’ answer to the most impactful position in sports.\nNeither GM Andrew Berry nor team owner Jimmy Haslam endorsed Sanders as their 2026 answer.",
    "fullText": "On a day when the Cleveland Browns knew fans wanted answers and accountability, team brass didn’t hide the direction the franchise must go.\n\n“The offense, it’s no secret that’s where we’re going to invest most of our resources this offseason,” general manager Andrew Berry said.\n\nTeam owner Jimmy Haslam agreed that “we have a lot of work to do on the roster, particularly on the offensive side of the roster.”\n\nThat neither man crowned any quarterback on their roster as the 2026 leader was telling — not because Shedeur Sanders, Dillon Gabriel and Deshaun Watson have no chance, but because it is clear that none of them has a guarantee.\n\nA new head coach will arrive in Cleveland soon, after the Browns fired Kevin Stefanski after six seasons featured a 45-56 (.446) regular-season record.\n\nThat coach will have meaningful say on who starts at quarterback for the Browns next season and what will be most highly valued at the position.\n\n[Get more Browns news: Cleveland team feed]\n\nThat the Browns will hire an offensive-minded head coach to develop that quarterback is no guarantee: The job will be “to make sure that the offense is run and developed well,” Berry said, “as opposed to necessarily having to be the person that directly does it.”\n\nBut losing, particularly in three- and five-win seasons the last two years, cost Stefanski his job. And the Browns know that finding a lasting quarterback answer is the No. 1 factor that will correlate with turning around their win total.\n\nNo one is saying aloud that Sanders, Gabriel and Watson cannot be the answer. But the organization planted seeds of doubt Monday about the Browns’ answer to the most impactful position in sports.\n\nNeither Berry nor Haslam endorsed Sanders, their starter to end the season, as their 2026 answer. The next head coach will have a say, and Sanders himself acknowledged that “when it comes to those grown-up decisions that’s not me.”\n\nWhat the Browns do know, and were willing to say, is that they need an answer quickly.\n\n“At the end of the day, the National Football League is a quarterback league, right?” seven-time Pro Bowl left guard Joel Bitonio said. “If you have an elite quarterback in this league, it allows you to be a little bit more sustained in your success. And it's not me saying like, ‘Do we know if Shedeur or Dillon or Deshaun or Bailey [Zappe], any of these guys is that guy,’ right?\n\n“We have those guys in our locker room. But until you have a guy that can stay healthy and can be on the field and be that guy for your team, it's hard to have that sustained success. …\n\n“Until you find one that's stable and can lead your team, it's going to be hard to not ride the roller coaster of wins and losses.”\n\nThe Browns do not regret that they evaluated and practiced with four quarterbacks during the offseason and training camp.\n\nConsidering depth was not the problem. Missing on a higher ceiling was.\n\n“We believe in competition in every room on the roster, and quarterback’s no different,” Berry said. “Quarterback is the most important position in sports. We all know that. And part of the equation with quarterback is the evaluation part. Part of it is the development part as well.”\n\nThe Browns traded away the second overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft rather than spend a premium pick on quarterback as some expected. Later in the draft, they selected two quarterbacks — Gabriel in the third round followed by Sanders in the fifth. It was a curious move. And yet, Berry believes philosophically in expending significant resources at quarterback.\n\n“I wouldn't necessarily say draft a quarterback every year, I don't believe it being that,” Berry told Yahoo Sports last June from minicamp. “But if you're in position to make a bet on a quarterback that you think can be a quality starter or some level of high-level proficiency, understand that it's not always going to pan out. That's a bet you should be making because you just never know.”\n\nThe philosophy suggests the Browns will not stay put at quarterback this spring, the question of their acquisition more a question of how rather than if. In their 2025 season, the Browns recognized their transitional stage and built up the roster at some positions. But while their defense posted its second top-five unit in three years, the Browns’ offense ranked bottom-five in offense for the second straight season.\n\nA year after ranking last in scoring, the Browns ranked second-to-last this year. In what Berry and Haslam described as a year of roster “transition,” the franchise evaluated its rookies at length.\n\nThe Browns won three of Sanders’ seven games compared to one of Gabriel's six, wins often considered the “most important” quarterback statistic. In traditional quarterback stats, their performance was mixed.\n\nSanders averaged 193 passing yards per start compared to Gabriel’s 153, while completing 59.5% of his attempts to Gabriel’s 58.9%. But Sanders’ 0.8 touchdown-to-interception ratio (seven touchdowns, nine interceptions in seven games) paled in comparison to Gabriel’s 3.0 (six touchdowns to two interceptions in six games). Sanders’ 72.9 passer rating trailed Gabriel’s 78.9.\n\nSanders earned the right to continue starting and warranting evaluation through season’s end. But with below-league-average metrics, the Browns are not saying right now that he’s earned the right to start next season.\n\n“We saw a lot of progress with Shedeur this year,” Berry said. “I think that’s both mentally, physically, playing the position. He’s still very much a work in progress like many rookie quarterbacks are. But I think we saw some really good things in terms of his playmaking, his accuracy, his ability to extend [plays] with his feet. And I think I’d also give him credit as well as our offensive staff for bringing him along in terms of his pocket management, his situational awareness and things of that nature.\n\n“Now that all being said, we’re going to do our work on the quarterback market. It’s too important of a position and it’s something that has to be solidified. I can’t sit here and tell you today, you know, whether the solution for or the starter in 2026 is internal or external. But it’s something that we’re going to work through over the next several weeks. And quite honestly, the new head coach will also have a lot of input into that as well.”\n\nPerhaps the best thing the Browns can do for their quarterback future is hire the coach they best believe will lead their organization, independent of any single quarterback style.\n\nBerry acknowledged that “schemes, they really do come and go.” An NFC assistant coach whose team helped their quarterback rebound after a coaching change felt no single schematic factor was the answer in their club.\n\n“I think they just need to find the best coach possible,” the assistant told Yahoo Sports. “You just need to hire the best guy for each job of the organization vs. being predetermined to get a QB guru or whatever you think you need stylistically.\n\n“That way you’re able to pivot if it turns out [the quarterback] isn’t the guy, but at least you hired the right coach.”\n\nThis year’s sophomore quarterback class is evidence of that.\n\nSetting a historic pace, teams selected six quarterbacks in the first 12 picks of the 2024 NFL Draft. Second overall pick Jayden Daniels took the Commanders to the NFC Championship game in his first season under center. This year, three more 2024 quarterbacks have led their teams to a playoff berth.\n\nSelected at first, third and 12th respectively, Caleb Williams, Drake Maye and Bo Nix vary in style and NFL early-career experience. While Nix arrived to an organization with coaching stability, receiving play calls from Super Bowl-winning Sean Payton, his counterparts each entered Year 2 with a new head coach. Their two coaching résumés differ vastly, Ben Johnson a first-time head coach who’s calling offensive plays while Mike Vrabel is a second-time head coach calling plays on neither side of the ball.\n\nAnd yet, talent evaluators around the league look at each of their stories and see the success stemming from coach at least as much as quarterback. The “right” coach was hired. Neither his quality or quantity of experience determined whether he was the right coach.\n\nFinding Mr. Right will be Berry’s job in the coming weeks, after which the group will decide how and with whom they want to augment the quarterback room. Doing nothing, while currently on track for a host of 2026 draft picks, including the sixth overall as well as a late first-round selection, would be shocking.\n\nWhile free agency is always an option, 12 of the 14 starting quarterbacks in this year’s postseason were selected in the first round. Three are no longer with the team that initially drafted them, a reminder of success teams have had in recent years finding quarterbacks via trade or free agency.\n\nThat history may be a tell for the Browns brass’s next move. And it may be a tell of Sanders’ chance at keeping his starting job through 2026. Fifth-round quarterbacks face uphill battles. So do quarterbacks selected before a coach had input in that decision.\n\n“I think overall, like as a quarterback, I showed different pieces in different games to all add up to one complete quarterback,” Sanders said. “And that’s what I had to get to in those situations — red-zone situations, field-goal situations, third-down situations, ‘where you at on the field’ situations. So, it was a lot of situations that was good. I feel like this was a good learning year for me, and I’m excited for it. Because like I say, like moving forward I’ll be prepared.\n\n“I did what I was able to do, and I definitely grew from a lot of things. And I got experience now. So, I’m always the same: confidence-wise, I’m there. But like, that’s not in my hands. Like, that’s not my decision.\n\n“I can’t speak on what other people feel.”",

    "description": "The Lakers will reportedly be judicious when it comes to whom they may agree to trade for in the coming weeks.",
    "fullText": "The NBA's trade deadline is exactly one month away, and it has become beyond clear that the Los Angeles Lakers will need to make at least one deal before that deadline if they are to have any real shot at winning this season's NBA championship.\n\nThey have a strong core centered around Luka Doncic, LeBron James and Austin Reaves, as well as a few very solid non-stars and role players. But they could use one or two more role players or \"connector\" players who possess plenty of athleticism and are capable of providing above-average defense and high-accuracy 3-point shooting.\n\nRight now, they lack tradable assets, but on draft day, they will be able to trade up to three first-round draft picks, including their 2026 first-rounder, once they use it on draft day. They should also have a lot more financial flexibility once the new league year arrives since several players' contracts will expire, including that of James, who will make $52.6 million this season.\n\nInsider Marc Stein wrote on his Substack that Los Angeles is willing to sacrifice that flexibility if it acquires a player who will move the needle right now.\n\n\"League sources say that the Lakers continue to scour the trade market in hopes of acquiring a two-way wing with size before the Feb. 5 trade deadline,\" Stein wrote.\n\n\"Two factors, though, continue to work against a trade.\n\n\"1) The market for such wings who can shoot from distance and defend remains quite limited, with New Orleans still resistant to trade interest in both Herb Jones and Trey Murphy III.\n\n\"2) It’s believed that the Lakers are only going to sacrifice their projected financial flexibility in the summer — which is expected to furnish them with the ability to make significant roster changes — only if they can acquire a real needle-mover at the position. Will such a player actually become available over the next four weeks and change?\"\n\nLakers fans are holding out hope that the team can swing a trade for future Hall of Famer Giannis Antetokounmpo sometime between now and the start of next season. But it is unknown how serious L.A. is about trying to land him, or if he would even be available or want to play for the Purple and Gold.\n\nSince such a trade may be unrealistic, the best fans can hope for may be a trade for one or two players who will upgrade the roster in terms of athleticism, defense and 3-point shooting. But that just may be enough to put the Lakers over the top.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers would only sacrifice financial flexibility for 'needle-mover'",

    "description": "NASA and Roscosmos continue to monitor and investigate the previously observed cracks.\"",
    "fullText": "A small section of the International Space Station that has experienced persistent leaks for years appears to have stopped venting atmosphere into space.\n\nThe leaks were caused by microscopic structural cracks inside the small PrK module on the Russian segment of the space station, which lies between a Progress spacecraft airlock and the Zvezda module. The problem has been a long-running worry for Russian and US operators of the station, especially after the rate of leakage doubled in 2024. This prompted NASA officials to label the leak as a “high likelihood” and “high consequence” risk.\n\nHowever, recently two sources indicated that the leaks have stopped. And NASA has now confirmed this.\n\n“Following additional inspections and sealing activities, the pressure in the transfer tunnel attached to the Zvezda Service Module of the International Space Station, known as the PrK, is holding steady in a stable configuration,” a space agency spokesman, Josh Finch, told Ars. “NASA and Roscosmos continue to monitor and investigate the previously observed cracks for any future changes that may occur.”\n\nFor the better part of half a decade, Russian cosmonauts have been searching for the small leaks like a proverbial needle in a haystack. They would periodically close the hatch leading to the PrK module and then, upon re-opening it, look for tiny accumulations of dust to indicate the leak sites.\n\nThen the Russian cosmonauts would apply a sealant known as Germetall-1 (which has now been patented) to the cracks. They would close the hatch again, monitor the pressure inside the PrK module, and begin the search anew for additional leaks. This process went on for years.\n\nTheir success with the long-running leak problem probably will not prevent new leaks from developing in the decades-old hardware. The Zvezda module was launched a quarter of a century ago, in July 2000, on a Russian Proton rocket. The cracking issue first appeared in 2019, and despite the long-running investigations, its precise cause remains unknown. But this is a nice win in space for both Russia and NASA.\n\nThere is other potential good news on the horizon regarding Russia’s civil space program. This involves the country’s primary launch pad for getting people and cargo to the International Space Station.\n\nThe problems there occurred when a Soyuz rocket launched Roscosmos cosmonauts Sergei Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikayev, as well as NASA astronaut Christopher Williams, on an eight-month mission to the International Space Station in late November. The rocket had no difficulties, but a large mobile platform below the rocket was not properly secured prior to the launch and crashed into the flame trench below, taking the pad offline.\n\nIt is unclear when the pad, Site 31 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, will come back online.\n\nRussia had been targeting a return-to-flight mission in March 2026. NASA now appears to believe that. The US space agency’s internal schedule, which was recently updated, has the next Progress spacecraft launch set for March 22, followed by another Progress mission on April 26. The next Soyuz crewed mission, MS-29, remains scheduled for July 14th. This flight will carry NASA astronaut Anil Menon to the space station.",

    "fullText": "The Star Gauge (Chinese: 璇璣圖; pinyin: Xuánjī Tú), or translated as \"the armillary sphere chart\", is the posthumous title given to a 4th-century Classical Chinese poem written by the Former Qin poet Su Hui for her husband during the Sixteen Kingdoms period. It consists of a 29 by 29 grid of characters, forming a reversible poem that can be read in different ways to form roughly 3,000 smaller rhyming poems.[1] The outer border forms a single circular poem, thought to be both the first and the longest of its kind.\n\nThe Star Gauge consists of 841 characters in a grid. The original was described by contemporary sources as shuttle-woven on brocade. It was composed by Su Hui during a time when East Asian Mādhyamaka was one of the predominant philosophical schools in the area.[2]\n\nThe outer border is meant to be read in a circle. The grid is known as a palindrome poem, and can be read in different ways to generate over 3,000 shorter poems, in which the second line of every couplet rhymes with that of the next.[1] The largest set of such poems are 2,848 four-liners with seven characters per line. In the image below, the maroon grid is made up of 32 seven-character phrases. These may be read in certain patterns around the perimeter, and in other patterns for the internal grid.[1] Other poems can be formed by reading characters from the other colored sections.\n\n琴清流楚激弦商秦曲發聲悲摧藏音和詠思惟空堂心憂增慕懷慘傷仁\n芳廊東步階西遊王姿淑窈窕伯邵南周風興自后妃荒經離所懷歎嗟智\n蘭休桃林陰翳桑懷歸思廣河女衛鄭楚樊厲節中闈淫遐曠路傷中情懷\n凋翔飛燕巢雙鳩土迤逶路遐志詠歌長嘆不能奮飛妄清幃房君無家德\n茂流泉清水激揚眷頎其人碩興齊商雙發歌我袞衣想華飾容朗鏡明聖\n熙長君思悲好仇舊蕤葳桀翠榮曜流華觀冶容為誰感英曜珠光紛葩虞\n陽愁嘆發容摧傷鄉悲情我感傷情徵宮羽同聲相追所多思感誰為榮唐\n春方殊離仁君榮身苦惟艱生患多殷憂纏情將如何欽蒼穹誓終篤志貞\n牆禽心濱均深身加懷憂是嬰藻文繁虎龍寧自感思岑形熒城榮明庭妙\n面伯改漢物日我兼思何漫漫榮曜華雕旌孜孜傷情幽未猶傾苟難闈顯\n殊在者之品潤乎愁苦艱是丁麗壯觀飾容側君在時岩在炎在不受亂華\n意誠惑步育浸集悴我生何冤充顏曜繡衣夢想勞形峻慎盛戒義消作重\n感故暱飄施愆殃少章時桑詩端無終始詩仁顏貞寒嵯深興後姬源人榮\n故遺親飄生思愆精徽盛醫風比平始璇情賢喪物歲峨慮漸孽班禍讒章\n新舊聞離天罪辜神恨昭盛興作蘇心璣明別改知識深微至嬖女因奸臣\n霜廢遠微地積何遐微業孟鹿麗氏詩圖顯行華終凋淵察大趙婕所佞賢\n水故離隔德怨因幽元傾宣鳴辭理興義怨士容始松重遠伐氏好恃兇惟\n齊君殊喬貴其備曠悼思傷懷日往感年衰念是舊愆涯禍用飛辭恣害聖\n傑子我木平根當遠嘆水感悲思憂遠勞情誰為獨居經在昭燕輦極我配\n志惟同誰均難苦離戚戚情哀慕歲殊嘆時賤女懷歡網防青實漢驕忠英\n清新衾陰勻尋辛鳳知我者誰世異浮寄傾鄙賤何如羅萌青生成盈貞皇\n純貞志一專所當麟沙流頹逝異浮沉華英翳曜潛陽林西昭景薄榆桑倫\n望微精感通明神龍馳若然倏逝惟時年殊白日西移光滋愚讒漫頑凶匹\n誰雲浮寄身輕飛昭虧不盈無倏必盛有衰無日不陂流蒙謙退休孝慈離\n思輝光飭桀殊文德離忠體一達心意志殊憤激何施電疑危遠家和雍飄\n想群離散妾孤遺懷儀容仰俯榮華麗飾身將無誰為逝容節敦貞淑思浮\n懷悲哀聲殊乖分聖貲何情憂感惟哀志節上通神祇推持所貞記自恭江\n所春傷應翔雁歸皇辭成者作體下遺葑菲採者無差生從是敬孝為基湘\n親剛柔有女為賤人房幽處己憫微身長路悲曠感生民梁山殊塞隔河津\n\nEarly sources focused on the circular poem composing the outer border of the grid, consisting of 112 characters. Later sources described the whole grid of 840 characters (not counting the central character 心 xin, meaning \"heart\", which lends meaning to the whole but is not part of any of the smaller poems).\n\nThe text of the poem was circulated continuously in medieval China and was never lost, but during the Song dynasty it became scarce. The 112-character version was included in early sources. The earliest surviving excerpts of the entire grid version date from a 10th-century text by Li Fang.\n\nWhile sources agree that Su was a talented poet, the background story and interpretation of the poem changed over the centuries, from the lament of a wife longing for her husband, to a wife worrying about her husband fighting on the frontier, to a jealous wife competing for her husband's affections.[4]\n\nDou Tao of Qinzhou was exiled to the desert, away from his wife Lady Su. Upon departure from Su, Dou swore that he would not marry another person. However, as soon as he arrived in the desert region, he married someone. Lady Su composed a circular poem, wove it into a piece of brocade, and sent it to him.[6]\n\nAnother source, naming the poem as Xuanji Tu (Picture of the Turning Sphere), claimed that the grid as a whole was a palindromic poem comprehensible only to Dou (which would explain why none of the Tang sources reprinted it), and that when he read it, he left his desert wife and returned to Su Hui.[7]\n\nSome 13th-century copies were attributed to famous women of the Song dynasty, but falsely so.[8] The poem was also mentioned in the novel Flowers in the Mirror.",

    "fullText": "I need to confess something embarrassing. I can't finish reading articles anymore.\n\nI don't mean I choose not to. I mean I physically cannot. My brain won't let me.\n\nIt wasn't always like this. In my twenties, I was the guy who read everything. Long investigative pieces, academic papers, entire book chapters in one sitting. Reading was my identity. I was proud of it.\n\nThen somewhere around 32 or 33, something broke.\n\nI remember the exact moment I realized how bad it had gotten.\n\nI was at a dinner party at Christmas. Someone brought up an article about AI that had been making the rounds – you know the type, one of those big think pieces everyone was talking about. The whole table had opinions. They quoted specific paragraphs. They debated the author's conclusions.\n\nI had opened that same article three separate times that week. I never made it past the third paragraph.\n\nI just nodded along, pretending I'd read it, feeling like a fraud. On the drive home, I sat in my car in the garage for ten minutes, staring at the steering wheel, wondering what was wrong with me.\n\nIt got worse. I started avoiding articles entirely because opening them meant facing another failure.\n\nMy \"Read Later\" list became a graveyard – 2,000+ articles I'd never touch. Every time I saw that number, I felt a little more pathetic.\n\nMy wife would send me articles with \"you'll love this!\" and I'd respond with a thumbs up emoji, never actually reading them. Weeks later she'd ask what I thought, and I'd have to admit I never got to it. The disappointment in her eyes. That quiet \"oh.\" It killed me every time.\n\nMy colleagues would reference blog posts in meetings and I'd nod knowingly, having only read the headline. Sometimes I'd get called on to give an opinion, and I'd have to bullshit my way through, praying no one would ask follow-up questions.\n\nI started wondering if this was just aging. Maybe this is what happens in your mid-30s. Maybe I'd peaked intellectually and this was the long, slow decline. I genuinely believed that for a while.\n\nIt's a dark place, thinking you're getting dumber and there's nothing you can do about it.\n\nHere's what made me feel truly broken. I could scroll social media for hours with zero effort. Twitter threads, Reddit comments, YouTube shorts, TikTok – all completely effortless. My brain devoured that garbage happily.\n\nBut ask me to read something that actually mattered? Something that might make me smarter, more informed, a better person? Impossible.\n\nI felt like a lab rat, programmed to seek the easiest dopamine hit. Like I'd lost control of my own mind. Like the version of me who used to read Cosmos by Carl Sagan for fun was dead, replaced by this hollow, distracted shell.\n\nSome nights I'd lie awake wondering. 'Is this who I am now? Forever?'\n\nOne night – 2am, couldn't sleep, lying in bed doom-scrolling (the irony wasn't lost on me) – I came across an article about attention and the modern web. Ironically, I couldn't finish it either. But I read enough, luckily.\n\nThe article argued that our brains aren't broken. The web is.\n\nModern articles are designed by teams of people whose job is to maximize \"engagement metrics.\" Scroll depth. Time on page. Ad impressions. Click-through rates. Everything around the content – sidebars, related articles, social buttons, newsletter popups, comment sections, auto-playing videos – is optimized to pull our attention away from what we came to read.\n\nThe content itself is often padded with filler to hit word count targets. Paragraphs are written to be skimmed, not absorbed. Headlines are designed to be shared, not understood.\n\nWe're not failing to read. We're fighting an environment that's engineered to prevent deep reading.\n\nThat reframe hit me hard. What if I wasn't broken? What if I'd just been blaming myself for losing a fight that was rigged from the start?\n\nThat night, still unable to sleep, I opened my laptop and started coding.\n\nParsely is stupidly simple. When you click the extension icon (or press Ctrl+Shift+R), the entire webpage fades away. It blurs and darkens into the background. In the center of your screen appears a single, beautifully formatted paragraph.\n\nJust that paragraph. Nothing else.\n\nYou read it. You press the arrow key or spacebar. The next paragraph slides in. The previous one fades but stays visible above, grayed out, so you don't lose context. Below, you can see a hint of what's coming next.\n\nIt's like reading a book, but on the web. One thought at a time.\n\nNo sidebars. No popups. No \"\n\nI was skeptical it would make any difference. I'd tried so many things. But the first time I used it, I read an entire 4,000-word essay about urban planning. The whole thing. Without stopping. Without checking my phone. Without that familiar urge to escape.\n\nWhen I finished, I just sat there for a moment. I felt... proud? It sounds pathetic, but finishing an article had become so rare that it felt like an accomplishment.\n\nI've been using Parsely daily for months now. Last week I read a 6,000-word piece about AI energy policy – dense, technical, important. I not only finished it, I took notes. I remembered it well enough to discuss it intelligently the next day. I felt like my old self again.\n\nHere's what I didn't anticipate. It changed more than just my reading.\n\nMy wife sent me an article last month. I actually read it. The whole thing. That night, we talked about it over dinner for an hour. She looked at me differently – like she was seeing the person she married again. That meant more to me than I can express.\n\nAt work, I'm contributing to discussions again. Not bullshitting, actually contributing. Referencing things I've read, understood, and thought about. The impostor syndrome is fading.\n\nI'm reading books again. Actual books. My attention span is slowly healing, paragraph by paragraph.\n\nI don't think I was broken. I think I was a normal human being, fighting an unfair fight against a system designed to fragment my attention. And I think a lot of people are in the same boat, quietly blaming themselves, just like I was.\n\nI debated whether to post this. It's embarrassing to admit how much I was struggling with something that sounds so simple. \"Just read the article, dude.\"\n\nBut I keep meeting people who describe the exact same thing. The shame. The avoidance. The feeling that something is wrong with them. And I wonder how many people are suffering in silence, never realizing that the problem might not be them at all.\n\nSo here it is. A tool born from my own frustration, my own shame, my own 2am desperation. Maybe it'll help someone else too.\n\nIf any of this resonates, give Parsely a try. And if you have ideas for making it better, I'd genuinely love to hear them. I'm building this for people like me, which means I'm building it for people like you.\n\nInstall Parsely and try it on your next article. It's free, forever.",

    "fullText": "I recently came across a cute game called https://enclose.horse. In this game, there is a horse in the middle of a field and a bunch of rivers surrounding it. You have to \"enclose\" the horse by cutting off its access to the boundaries of the map using a limited set of walls. The game is to create the largest possible space you can under those constraints. It's harder to explain in words than if you just go try the game.\n\nWhat the game is asking you to do, in graph theory terms, is to find a vertex cut that maximizes the number of vertices on a particular side of the cut. A vertex cut is a set of vertices that separates two other sets of vertices. In this image, the set W separates the sets A and B:\n\nIn the horse game, A is the square that the horse stands on, B is the set of edge tiles, and there are edges between any two adjacent grass tiles. We are picking a set W when we place walls as we try to find a set that the horse would have to pass through in order to escape.\n\nIn school I had the thought that in general, solving computationally difficult problems was probably a good basis for constructing puzzle games. I don't think I was right in general, since my \"minimal vertex cover\" game was not particularly fun. But I think this game is pretty fun overall! And the presentation is cute and good.\n\nAs an armchair game designer, I'm obligated to weigh in that I think this kind of game (including stuff like Wordle and my personal favourite catfishing) would be dramatically improved design-wise by the inclusion of a timer. I think balance-wise (\"balance\" perhaps not in the sense of like, \"game balance\" but in the sense of, \"the composition of the elements of design being in harmony\" sense), the strategy of \"spending a really, really long time thinking about it\" is much too strong and not that much fun, and negates a lot of strategies one might otherwise develop to quickly identify possible solutions and learn more about the underlying problem structure. I recognize that this kind of element would probably make for a less popular game, but I think it would make for a more sound game.\n\nAnyway. Playing this game made me think about a cool theorem from graph theory that is a useful such strategy for quickly convincing yourself of certain facts about the playing field. Go play the game first, and then come back, so I don't have to explain in more detail how it works.\n\nMenger's Theorem says that in a graph, the number of vertices you need to delete to disconnect two vertices is equal to the number of disjoint paths between those vertices. By disjoint paths I mean paths that connect A and B and don't share any vertices (besides those in A and B).\n\nOne direction of Menger's theorem, that you need to delete at least as many vertices as disjoint paths, is very easy. The other direction is harder and more surprising.\n\nSpecifically the yellow exit. It's probably not too hard to convince yourself with some trial and error that it's not possible to block that exit off from the red zone with fewer than three walls, but we can use the easy direction of Menger's theorem to prove it quickly and easily by finding three disjoint paths from the red zone to the exit:\n\nThese three paths constitute a proof that you need at least three walls to block that exit off.\n\nHowever, since we can block off the horse specifically from going that way with only two walls:\n\nMenger's theorem tells us that there are at most two disjoint paths from the horse to the exit (going that way, we can actually walk around in this particular map.\n\nTools like this are why I think this kind of game would benefit from a stricter time limit: building up these quick heuristics is fun! And can let you quickly prune parts of the search space without having to do an exhaustive search. But without a time limit, become a bit less useful, since doing things quickly is not especially valuable. I'd like to see future games of this nature explore this sort of thing a bit more.",

Its board of directors chose Monday to shutter CPB completely instead of keeping it in existence as a shell.\n\n“CPB’s final act would be to protect the integrity of the public media system and the democratic values by dissolving, rather than allowing the organization to remain defunded and vulnerable to additional attacks,” said Patricia Harrison, the organization’s president and CEO.\n\nMany Republicans have long accused public broadcasting, particularly its news programming, of being biased toward liberals but it wasn’t until the second Trump administration —- with full GOP control of Congress — that those criticisms were turned into action.\n\nRuby Calvert, head of CPB’s board of directors, said the federal defunding of public media has been devastating.\n\n“Even at this moment, I am convinced that public media will survive, and that a new Congress will address public media’s role in our country because it is critical to our children’s education, our history, culture and democracy to do so,” Calvert said.\n\nCPB said it was financially supporting the American Archive of Public Broadcasting in its effort to preserve historic content, and is working with the University of Maryland to maintain its own records.",

    "description": "An open source diff and file rendering library by The Pierre Computer Company.",
    "fullText": "@pierre/diffs is an open source diff and code rendering library. It's built on Shiki for syntax highlighting and theming, is super customizable, and comes packed with features. Made with love by The Pierre Computer Company.\n\nChoose from stacked (unified) or split (side-by-side). Both use CSS Grid and Shadow DOM under the hood, meaning fewer DOM nodes and faster rendering.\n\nWe built @pierre/diffs on top of Shiki for syntax highlighting and general theming. Our components automatically adapt to blend in with your theme selection, including across color modes.\n\nLove the Pierre themes? Install our Pierre VS Code Theme pack with light and dark flavors.\n\nYour diffs, your choice. Render changed lines with classic diff indicators (+/–), full-width background colors, or vertical bars. You can even highlight inline changes—character or word based—and toggle line wrapping, hide numbers, and more.\n\n@pierre/diffs adapts to any font, font-size, line-height, and even font-feature-settings you may have set. Configure font options with your preferred CSS method globally or on a per-component basis.\n\nUse renderHeaderMetadata to inject custom content and components into the file header. Perfect for adding view toggles, theme switchers, copy buttons, or any other file-level actions while preserving the built-in header.\n\n@pierre/diffs provide a flexible annotation framework for injecting additional content and context. Use it to render your own line comments, annotations from CI jobs, and other third-party content.\n\nShould we validate the role parameter? We could restrict it to a set of allowed values.\n\nGood idea, maybe use a Literal type or an enum.\n\nAgreed, we should also update verify_token to return the role.\n\nAnnotations can also be used to build interactive code review interfaces similar to AI-assisted coding tools like Cursor. Use it to track the state of each change, inject custom UI like accept/reject buttons, and provide immediate visual feedback.\n\nTurn on line selection with enableLineSelection: true. When enabled, clicking a line number will select that line. Click and drag to select multiple lines, or hold Shift and click to extend your selection. You can also control the selection programmatically. Also selections will elegantly manage the differences between split and unified views.\n\nIn addition to rendering standard Git diffs and patches, you can pass any two files in @pierre/diffs and get a diff between them. This is especially useful when comparing across generative snapshots where linear history isn't always available. Edit the css below to see the diff.\n\nOur team has decades of cumulative experience in open source, developer tools, and more. We’ve worked on projects like Coinbase, GitHub, Bootstrap, Twitter, Medium, and more. This stuff is our bread and butter, and we’re happy to share it with you.",

    "fullText": "Olive farmers in Syria are facing one of their worst harvest seasons ever. Changing weather patterns and a prolonged conflict have affected crop yields, threatening food security and driving food prices up.\n\nSyria was a major global olive producer prior to the civil war that began in 2011.\n\nAccording to the Arab Reform Initiative, the country had more than 79 million olive trees, producing about 1.1 million tons of olives. Daraa province was home to more than 6.5 million olive trees that spanned up to 30,000 hectares, according to The Syrian Observer.\n\nAt the start of the war, olive production in Daraa stood at 75,800 tons per year, per Syria Direct. During the conflict, this number declined as olive farmers were forced to abandon their trees and farmland in search of safety. By 2022, olive production in Daraa had reached a low of 22,300 tons annually, a 70% decline.\n\nThough data shows that olive production had been steadily rising since 2022, this past harvest season, cursed with the country's worst drought in over four decades, became the lowest yield on record.\n\nIn 2025, olive farmers in Daraa produced only 10,000 tons of olives — a 68% reduction compared to yields in 2024.\n\n\"The current season is one of the worst in more than 20 years. The yield per olive tree has dropped by half compared to last year,\" said Muawiya al-Zoubi, an olive farmer in eastern Daraa, per Syria Direct.\n\nOlive trees are native to Syria.\n\nNative plants have generally adapted to local climates and are drought-tolerant because of their root systems, which allow them to source water and nutrients from deep underground.\n\nHowever, this year's olive yields suggest that the extreme drought that hit Syria and surrounding countries was so severe that even native plants struggled to survive.\n\nWhat is the biggest reason you don't grow food at home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nDroughts and other extreme weather events, including flash floods and monsoons, have devastated farmers globally.\n\nAlmond production in Portugal fell 85% because of heavy rainfall, for example. A historic drought in Vermont drastically reduced corn production. Farmers in India faced the worst monsoon in the last 45 years, damaging major crops such as grapes.\n\nCrop losses not only threaten food availability for local communities, but they also increase the production costs for farmers. This increased cost is passed on to consumers via inflated grocery prices.\n\nChanging weather conditions and rising temperatures have large impacts on crop production, underscoring the importance of adopting climate-resilient agricultural practices.\n\nThough extreme weather conditions are not easily predictable, trends show that these devastating events are becoming more frequent and intense. The agricultural industry must adapt to protect the global food supply.\n\nWatermelon farmers in Florida have employed automatic irrigation systems that keep their fields watered without wasting any of the vital resource. The technology, which serves over 1,883 acres of farmland, has saved more than 165 million gallons of water compared to traditional irrigation systems.\n\nResearchers in Kenya have developed a mobile solar irrigation system that supplies farmers with water in dry climates. This development allows farmers to protect their crops without having to drastically change infrastructure to support additional irrigation.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "The new entity that owns San Francisco Centre, the city's biggest mall, has sued to evict three of the last remaining tenants, according to court filings.\n\nAn unlawful detainer motion filed Friday seeks the eviction of Executive Order bar; KBR Enterprises Inc., which operates the Shoe Wiz repair service; and Fardin Amiri, who appears to own a salon in the mall.\n\nThe businesses couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Executive Order owner John Eric Sanchez previously told the Chronicle that he would fight to stay. \"We're trying to hold out as long as we can,\" he said in November.\n\nSan Francisco Business Times first reported the filing.\n\nDBJPM 2016-SFC Emporium, the group of lenders that bought the mall's debt in November, previously sent letters to the last two dozen final tenants, saying their leases were terminated. Most of the last holdouts at the mall have already closed or plan to this month, including Shake Shack, Aritzia, H&M and GNC.\n\nThe mall's death spiral started after the pandemic and remote work devastated foot traffic in the Powell Street area, leading to the closures of anchor tenants Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's.\n\nBrokerage CBRE has now been hired to sell the mall again, but real estate experts have said that any reimagining of the property into another usage could be prohibitively expensive. A full closure of the mall, which hasn't been confirmed, would cut expenses such as utilities and security costs for the ownership group.\n\nThis article originally published at New owner of S.F.'s biggest mall sues to evict three of its last remaining tenants.",

    "description": "A reputable leaker has indicated that NVIDIA plans on bringing the RTX 3060 back to market. This would be marketed toward PC gamers as an alternative to the newer GPUs that are being gobbled up by AI.",
    "fullText": "A reputable leaker has indicated that NVIDIA plans on bringing the RTX 3060 back to market, according to reports by Kotaku and WFCCTech. It first released the GPU at the beginning of 2021. The leaker Hongxing2020 indicates that NVIDIA will resume production of the 3060 sometime in the next few months.\n\nWhy is the world's most valuable company reportedly bringing back such an antiquated graphics card? You know the answer. It's the endless gaping maw known as AI. Tech companies have been hoovering up PC parts for AI applications with reckless abandon. It has become a legitimate challenge for a regular person to buy RAM and graphics cards, which has led to price increases across the board and companies like Crucial closing up shop.\n\n01.05update\nrtx3060 Q1 come back… 🥲\n\n— hongxing2020 (@hongxing2020) January 5, 2026\n\nIt's particularly difficult to get ahold of GDDR7 RAM, which is needed for the newer RTX 5060 cards. So NVIDIA's solution looks to be a hop in the time machine to 2021. Gamers will need something, after all, and the 3060 technically gets the job done. Any downgrade in graphics and performance will be worth it once you watch an AI-generated video of Kurt Cobain singing in heaven with Albert Einstein, am I right? It's hilarious because they never got to meet in real life.\n\nThe RTX 3060 is still pretty popular, despite NVIDIA phasing out the card back in 2024. We don't know how much the company plans on charging for this trip down memory lane. The GPU originally cost around $329.\n\nOne would think that five-year-old technology could easily hit a much lower price point, but NVIDIA has us in a chokehold here and it can pretty much charge whatever it wants. Again, no price is too high when considering the magical wonders of generative AI. You can watch Tupac hang out with Mr. Rogers for five seconds.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nWhen Joan Van Kuren of Modesto got a notice from her insurance company stating they would not renew her home insurance policy, she was shocked to learn why. California insurance provider CSAA — part AAA’s insurance company — stated they discovered a “substantial increase in hazards” piling around her home. But they allegedly used aerial images from a drone to find it.\n\n“She said they [CSAA] flew a drone over the home,” Van Kuren told CBS Sacramento in 2024 of her call with a customer service representative. “It almost feels like someone’s looking in your windows, you know, when they tell you that they flew a drone over your home and looked at it.

If your home insurance company says they want to cut your insurance over concerns, here’s what you need to know.\n\nIn an increasing number of cases, insurance companies are using eyes in the skies to not only determine the condition of insured homes, but to assess damages once a natural disaster comes through.\n\nSince then, drones are becoming increasingly popular for insurance applications. Information technology consultant Cognizant says drones can improve efficiency and create additional accuracy, lead to closing claims faster, and improve safety for their employees.\n\nUsing a drone for an insurance inspection is not illegal in the State of California. ABC 7 San Francisco notes that unless you are using a drone to be a “Peeping Tom,” it’s legal to fly over homes and take videos.

    "title": "Mortgage and refinance interest rates today, January 5, 2026: Rates barely above 6% but look for even lower offers",
    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance rates. Rates have barely moved since the end of October. To get a low rate, you'll want to shop multiple lenders for your best offer.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates are barely above 6%, but some lenders are already offering home loans in the mid-5% range. According to Zillow data, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.01%, and the 15-year fixed rate is 5.44%.\n\nA 5.5% rate: See which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nMORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.01%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.01% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,800, and you’d pay $348,209 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.44% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.44% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,442. But you’d only pay $139,508 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 6.01%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.44%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.23%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 6.01%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S. And of course, your credit score.\n\nNot much. According to its December forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.4% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate above 6% through next year, yet dipping down to 5.9% in Q4 2026.\n\nThe best mortgage refinance companies charge low interest rates and fees, and they often have unique perks for customers. Find your best mortgage refinance lender.\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction. Choose the best mortgage lender for your needs.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program.

    "fullText": "HP has pulled out all of the stops for CES 2026, and one of the standout AI solutions is the HP EliteBook X G2 Series, introduced at the show.\n\nCES 2026 delivered a heavy dose of AI-powered computing, and HP led the charge. From the latest HyperX OMEN-branded gaming laptops to its professional lineup, HP has clearly gone ‘all in’ on AI. Designed for professionals who expect emerging technology to drive real productivity, the EliteBook X G2 portfolio takes the spotlight with future-ready AI performance and a mobile design that makes working with AI feel productive.\n\nSenior Vice President and Division President of Commercial Systems and Displays Solutions at HP, Guayente Sanmartin, said, “HP’s Work Relationship Index shows expectations are rising faster than fulfillment, and workers need technology that lightens that load with HP devices built for AI-driven workflows. The EliteBook X G2 Series brings AI experiences that adapt to individual workstyles, security that protects by default, and ultra-light mobility without trade-offs so leaders stay effective from anywhere,” regarding the new suite of AI-driven computing solutions.\n\nThe EliteBook X G2 Series presented on the CES 2026 showfloor comes with four different computing solutions ready to take on the front lines of work with AI functionality in hand.\n\nThese new innovative Copilot+ PCs combine AI performance, all-day power, easy adaptability\nand enterprise-grade security (with HP Wolf Security onboard), all in a sleek package that elevates the work experience wherever the worker may be. For the first time, HP lets the user pick their processor, with AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm options, all on the same platform.\n\nLeading the innovations is the EliteBook X G2i & EliteBook X Flip G2i Notebook Next Gen AI PCs. With a screen-to-body ratio of 90% (with the clamshell option) and 88% (with flip), this computing solution adapts to the user no matter the setting. Featuring a 14-inch OLED panel, both options are lightweight, have anti-glare technology, and this choice in the EliteBook X line is native to Intel processors. With optionality, consumers can expect up to 50 NPU (Neural Processing Unit) TOPS (trillions operations per second) and up to 180 platform TOPS for AI help wherever and whenever available.\n\nWhile the clamshell option for EliteBook X G2i is a more traditional approach, the EliteBook X Flip G2i adapts to your workflow with four versatile use modes and an optional HP Nested Pen. Consumers can reach beyond writing and sketching with onboard productivity functions like the ability to magnify small text by hovering. The EliteBook X G2i and the EliteBook X Flip G2i can even hit two hours of battery life on 30 minutes of charge. These new laptops will be available in February 2026.\n\nThe HP EliteBook X G2a Next Gen AI PC – With up to 55 TOPS NPU, the HP EliteBook X G2a adapts in real time and boosts performance when docked, conserving power when mobile, and stays cool under pressure. This AMD Ryzen processor option totes an OLED anti-glare panel just like the rest of the portfolio.\n\nThe HP EliteBook X G2q Next Gen AI PC – Denoted by the ‘q’ in the product’s name, this AI computing solution comes equipped with an up to Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Elite (an 18-core CPU), bringing the AI NPU up to 85 TOPS of processing power. The G2a and G2q options will arrive later than the G2i options sometime in the Spring 2026.\n\nAll of the EliteBook X G2 Series revealed at CES 2026 come equipped with AI functionality in mind, bringing CoPilot+ and NPU power in spades to provide AI solutions to casual and serious work. More information (pricing and availability) will be made available at a later date.\n\nAs CES 2026 is well underway, fans can stay tuned to CGMagazine for all CES 2026 news, including several announcements from HP. This includes their innovative EliteBoard and Series 7 Pro Monitor, as well as everything HyperX, OMEN, their new Omni line, and accessories for gamers to stay well-equipped on the battlefield.",

    "description": "Jonathan Carley admitted wearing His Majesty's Forces uniform without permission at Remembrance Sunday event.",
    "fullText": "For former history teacher Jonathan Carley, it must have felt like the walls closed in on him in an instant when police, searching for a fake Royal Navy officer, came knocking on the door of his grand clifftop home.\n\nInside, officers uncovered a pristine military uniform, medals and a ceremonial sword - a weapon that had first sparked suspicions.\n\nPolice were following reports that Carley, who had attended a Remembrance Sunday ceremony in north Wales dressed as a rear admiral, was actually an imposter.\n\nOn Monday, he was fined £500 after admitting to wearing a uniform or dress bearing the mark of His Majesty's Forces without permission.\n\nThe 65-year-old had joined those laying wreaths and saluted the war memorial at the ceremony in Llandudno last November.\n\nServing and former service personnel had become suspicious of the supposed rear admiral - the third highest rank in the Royal Navy - when they saw his sword and the rare Distinguished Service Order medal.\n\n\"It's one down from the Victoria Cross,\" Rear Admiral Dr Chris Parry told the BBC.\n\nHe said the DSO medal was an \"easy spot\" because it is such an exceptional award, and said only a small percentage of those who join the navy reach rear admiral.\n\n\"You're eight ranks up and two down from the head of the navy,\" said Parry, who left the Royal Navy in 2008.\n\nCarley had been attending events wearing the epaulettes and sleeve lace of a rear admiral for years, but some had been waiting to catch him.\n\nUnknown to Carley, the former private school teacher's dishonesty started to unravel at a drizzly Remembrance Day parade in Llandudno in 2024 – a year before he would be outed in national news.\n\n\"He had a massive sword on him and that is what really stuck out because we'd never seen it before,\" explained photographer Tony Mottram, who was taking pictures at the seaside resort's annual event in 2024 when he first spotted Carley.\n\nHe said Carley's medals, sword and the fact he was on his own made people wary.\n\n\"He kept in the background, but was suspicious because of that,\" said the 63-year-old who was in the Territorial Army and worked for the Royal Air Force.\n\n\"All the rest of us know each other by name. He just kept out of the picture. He was a bit of a loner, no one was talking to him.\"\n\nMottram did his best to get photographic evidence of the mystery rear admiral in 2024 - but before they knew it, he was gone.\n\nThere was outrage among some ex-service personnel and an agreement that if the bogus rear admiral was to try that again, they would be ready.\n\nSo when Carley, from Harlech in Gwynedd, resurfaced at the 2025 Remembrance Sunday service, albeit without his sword, Mr Mottram was making no mistakes.\n\n\"I looked at him more this year... and picked up on the collar, the cut and length of the tunic,\" he said.\n\n\"The hemming wasn't right, the length wasn't right. You either go on parade right or you don't go at all.\"\n\nCarley wore an array of medals on his chest which he had bought online, including the DSO - awarded for highly successful command and leadership during active operations - an honour very few personnel have been awarded since 1979.\n\nChief Petty Officer Terry Stewart had been forewarned about what happened in 2024 and after 27 years in the Royal Navy, he was suspicious about the rear admiral that was attending the 2025 parade alongside him.\n\n\"I asked the veterans in the vicinity if that was the same rear admiral as last year. They said yes,\" said CPO Stewart, who removed himself from the parade so he could follow the admiral.\n\n\"I approached him, saluted and introduced myself,\" added Stewart.\n\n\"I informed him that the ex-Royal Navy Veterans were not aware of him and I asked for his name. He said 'he must go' and that he was invited by the Lord Lieutenant's office.\"\n\nHe said Carley returned the salute, gave his full name and appeared confident and \"not at all\" worried.\n\nStewart was convinced he was talking to a fake.\n\nCarley was charged by police under a law from the 1800s that prohibits wearing a military uniform without permission - and on Monday he became the eighth person in 10 years to be taken to court charged with that offence in the UK.\n\nNo similar law exists for the medals he wore – or for those individuals that make up stories without dressing up.\n\nBBC News asked Carley about his motivation - but he didn't comment.\n\nIn his police interview, he said he wanted a sense of \"belonging and affirmation\".\n\nPictures and videos posted online show that Llandudno is not the first place Carley had dressed as a rear admiral.\n\nHe has been pictured at other Remembrance services in north Wales since 2018, shortly after it is believed he moved to the area.\n\nIn one video, he appears to be giving a speech to the public in his full admiral's uniform, complete with sword, at a Rorke's Drift memorial event.\n\nIronically, he was paying tribute to the military reenactors present.\n\nAndy Gittens first met Carley a few months before his Rorke's Drift speech, after he started attending rehearsals for his male voice choir.\n\n\"I think he'd said he was Navy. I can't remember him saying a rank,\" recalled Gittens, who said Carley didn't sing with them for long.\n\n\"As I recall he was very rarely there,\" said the former fireman from Gwynedd.\n\nBut when Gittens' choir attended Harlech Castle in 2019 for a Rorke's Drift memorial, they instantly recognised Carley.\n\n\"We gathered in the morning for rehearsal with the band and the choir. He was nowhere to be seen.\n\n\"All of a sudden he appears in this uniform. Normally those events are covered by the Lord Lieutenant, but he came bounding out larger than life.\n\n\"He was completely believable, dressed to the nines with his sword. He then proceeds to take over.\"\n\nGittens said despite his initial surprise at seeing Carley in this new role, he had no reason to doubt him until he saw the recent news coverage.\n\n\"He was quite amenable, very nice and a believable bloke,\" he said.\n\nIn the past, Carley has given newspaper interviews about both studying and rowing at Oxford and Harvard – as well as teaching at some of the country's most prestigious schools such as Eton, Cheltenham and Shiplake College.\n\nCheltenham College confirmed Carley did teach history and politics there between 1988 and 1992.\n\nThis period also appears to have been his only genuine brush with the military, with his name appearing in the London Gazette in 1991 as part of the college's Combined Cadet Force.\n\nAfter teaching, Carley is understood to have worked at Christ Church College, University of Oxford, as a rowing coach for several years.\n\nOne former student told us he was \"absolutely flabbergasted\" to see his former coach in the news while others spoke of a respected and \"warm, witty, fun\" coach.\n\n\"His role was head coach of at least a couple of the men's boats and was the coordinator of all things Christ Church rowing,\" said one former student.\n\n\"He was very good at motivating the crew. The speeches he gave were like they were previously scripted. I think other rowers really respected him. People worked really hard for him.\"\n\nCarley's former student said he \"would never have believed\" he would do something like that.\n\nEton College and the University of Oxford have not responded to requests for comment.\n\nMan admits dressing as fake navy admiral at Remembrance event\n\nIs the Australian Dream move still alive?\n\nSnow and ice warnings shut dozens of schools",

    "fullText": "Many businesses rely on nostalgia to forge deep emotional connections between their products and customers, supporting long-term brand loyalty.\n\nToday, this strategy is particularly valuable as customers grow more cautious of their spending amid rising costs and economic uncertainty.\n\nWith more than 44,000 locations across over 100 countries, McDonald's is one of the most recognizable fast-food brands in the world. While the company has continually evolved to stay competitive, it has also preserved its decades-old, globally identifiable image.\n\nThe company has strategically leveraged customers' nostalgic connections to its brand, which has helped it foster loyalty and solidify its status as a fast-food giant.\n\nOne of McDonald's most impactful nostalgic strategies has been its long-running collaboration with Pokémon. The partnership began in 1999 with the release of \"Pokémon: The First Movie,\" marking the start of a relationship that capitalized on nostalgia while producing generations of highly sought-after collectibles.\n\nIntroduced in 1996, Pokémon is a popular Japanese media franchise that has amassed a huge global following through the creation of video games, animated series, films, merchandise, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG).\n\nIn January 2025, McDonald's (MCD) launched a limited-time Pokémon Happy Meal collaboration featuring Dragon-type Pokémon designs with characters such as Charizard, Pikachu & Dragonite together, Rayquaza, and Roaring Moon.\n\nEach meal included a Pokémon TCG pack containing four of the 15 available cards, along with a Pokémon poster and a sticker sheet.\n\nTo enhance the experience, McDonald's introduced a free Pokémon TCG in-app game with a one-time redeemable code and created immersive PokéStops at select restaurant locations.\n\nNow, McDonald's is expected to partner with Pokémon once again.\n\nMcDonald's will reportedly partner with Pokémon to celebrate the franchise's 30th anniversary with a new limited-time McDonald's x Pokémon TCG Happy Meal, expected to debut in February and March 2026.\n\nAlthough the partnership is not yet officially confirmed by either McDonald's or Pokémon, Hypebeast indicates that the promotion will include four-card booster packs and feature themed packaging similar to previous releases.\n\nGiven the significance of the anniversary, fans speculate that the collaboration could come with a special surprise, much like the 25th anniversary collaboration in 2021, which released 50 collectible cards.\n\nMcDonald's maintained a long-standing relationship with Pokémon across both U.S. and international markets. The popularity of its collaboration has led to the recurring release of Pokémon-themed Happy Meals, featuring custom packaging, collectible TCG cards, and, in some cases, toys.\n\nThis partnership is particularly unique for the fast-food chain, as Pokémon Trading Cards are among the most valuable and sought-after collectibles in the world, with some cards worth up to millions of dollars.\n\n2011: Pokémon Black and White Happy Meal released in the U.S. for the first time from June to July 2011 \n\n2012: Pokémon Happy Meal from June to July 2012 \n\n2014: Pokémon X&Y Happy Meal from May to June 2014 \n\n2015: Pokémon Happy Meal with collectible toys and cards from November to December 2015 \n\n2017: Pokémon Sun & Moon Happy Meal from November to December 2017 \n\n2018: Pokémon special holographic TCG cards from October to November 2018 \n\n2019: Pokémon TCG cards and disc launcher from October to November 2019 \n\n2021: Pokémon 25th Anniversary Happy Meal \n\n2025: Dragon-type Pokémon Happy Meal \n\nLike other fast-food chains, McDonald's has faced mounting pressures in recent years, including slower customer traffic, sales declines, rising food costs, and weaker spending from cost-conscious consumers.\n\nPrices for food at home increased 2.6%, while prices for food away from home rose 3.7% in the 12 months ended September 2025, according to recent U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nAs a result, foodservice traffic declined 1% in the quarter ending June 2025, as consumers dined out less frequently, according to Circana.\n\nMore Food Insustry Businesss Startegy:\n\nChick-fil-A made a major change to its chicken, fans are noticing\n\nTaco Bell, Jack in the Box bring back discontinued menu items\n\nMcDonald’s and Burger King holiday promotions spark major backlash\n\nTo counter these trends, McDonald’s has expanded value offerings, including the McValue menu, Extra Value Meals, and $5 Meal Deals.\n\n\"In response to the decreasing food dollar and the empowered customer, restaurants are turning to innovative business and operating models to grab a greater share of the market,\" said KPMG Restaurant Segment Leader Paul Fultz and Strategy Leader of Consumer Markets Joel Rampoldt in a study.\n\nIn March, the company also launched the Restaurant Experience Team, bringing together operations, supply chain, franchising, development, restaurant design, delivery, and Speedee Labs to drive innovation and efficiency.\n\n\"Value is rarely defined only by price,\" said Circana Senior VP and Industry Advisor for Food and Foodservice David Portalatin in a statement. \"Operational excellence in providing quality, affordability, great experiences, and convenience is what leads winning restaurants and their supply chain partners to greater success.\"\n\nMcDonald's demonstrates how nostalgia can be more than a marketing tactic; it's a driver of brand loyalty, repeated engagement, and cultural relevance.\n\nExtended its digital presence to over 185 million 90-day active users across 60 markets.\n\nLoyalty customers generated about $30 billion in systemwide sales in 2024.\n\nGlobal comparable sales increased 3.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, with U.S. comparable sales up 2.4%.\n\nDespite improvement, the company remains cautious.\n\n\"We continue to remain cautious about the health of the consumer in the U.S. and our top international markets and believe the pressures will continue well into 2026,\" said McDonald’s CEO Christopher J. Kempczinski in an earnings call.\n\n\"It's a foundational expectation of our brand to bring consumers through our doors and keep them coming back.\"",

Security Council to voice opposition to the audacious U.S. military operation in Venezuela that captured leader Nicolás Maduro.\n\nBefore the U.N.'s most powerful body, countries critiqued — if sometimes obliquely — President Donald Trump's intervention in the South American country and his recent comments signaling the possibility of expanding military action to countries like Colombia and Mexico over drug trafficking accusations. The Republican president also has reupped his threat to take over the Danish territory of Greenland for the sake of U.S. security interests.\n\nDenmark, which has jurisdiction over the mineral-rich island, carefully denounced U.S. prospects for taking over Greenland without mentioning its NATO ally by name.\n\n“The inviolability of borders is not up for negotiation,” said Christina Markus Lassen, Danish ambassador to the U.N.\n\nShe also defended Venezuela's sovereignty, saying “no state should seek to influence political outcomes in Venezuela through the use of threat of force or through other means inconsistent with international law.”\n\nUS allies push back on Venezuela\n\nWhile French President Emmanuel Macron recently endorsed Maduro's capture, its U.N. envoy was slightly more critical Monday, saying any violations of international law by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, which include the U.S., erodes “the very foundation of the international order.”\n\n“The military operation that has led to the capture of Maduro runs counter to the principle of peace dispute resolution and runs counter to the principle of non-use of force,\" said Jay Dharmadhikari, deputy French ambassador to the U.N.\n\nU.S. envoy Mike Waltz defended the operation in Venezuela as a justified and “surgical law enforcement operation,” calling out the 15-member council for criticizing the targeting of Maduro.\n\n“If the United Nations in this body confers legitimacy on an illegitimate narco-terrorist with the same treatment in this charter of a democratically elected president or head of state, what kind of organization is this?” said Waltz, who is Trump’s former national security adviser.\n\nMaduro's 2024 reelection was widely disputed.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement that he is “deeply concerned that rules of international law have not been respected with regard to the 3 January military action.” He said the “grave” action by the U.S. could set a precedent for how future relations between nations unfold.\n\nVenezuela calls on the UN to take action\n\nEven with the strong support for Venezuela's sovereignty, its envoy called on the U.N. to go beyond veiled comments and condemnation. Ambassador Samuel Moncada urged the Security Council to demand that Washington release Maduro and his wife.\n\n“If the kidnapping of a head of state, the bombing of a sovereign country and the open threat of further armed action are tolerated or downplayed, the message sent to the world is a devastating one: namely that the law is optional, and that force is the true arbiter of international relations,” Moncada said.\n\nHe warned that other countries can’t afford to look away: “Accepting such a logic would mean to open the door to a deeply unstable world.”\n\nNeighboring Colombia described the raid as reminiscent of “the worst interference in our area in the past.”\n\n“Democracy cannot be defended or promoted through violence and coercion, and it cannot be superseded, either, by economic interests,” Ambassador Leonor Zalabata said.\n\nChina and Russia are expectedly critical\n\nThe biggest critics of U.S. foreign policy, China and Russia, which are also permanent members of the Security Council, called for the U.N. body to unite in rejecting America turning back to an “era of lawlessness.”\n\nMaduro, like his predecessor, forged a close relationship with Russia, while China was the main destination for most Venezuelan oil.\n\n“We cannot allow the United States to proclaim itself as some kind of a supreme judge, which alone bears the right to invade any country, to label culprits, to hand down and to enforce punishments irrespective of notions of international law, sovereignty and nonintervention,” Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said.\n\nHis own country’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine has drawn widespread condemnation within the U.N. and from the U.S., although the Trump administration is engaging with Russia in hopes of brokering an end to the fighting.\n\nThe U.S. seized Maduro and his wife early Saturday from their home on a military base and put them aboard a U.S. warship to face prosecution in New York in a Justice Department indictment accusing them of participating in a narco-terrorism conspiracy. Maduro declared his innocence during his first appearance in a Manhattan courthouse Monday.\n\nHis stunning removal came after months of the U.S. amassing a military presence off Venezuela’s coast and blowing up alleged drug trafficking boats. Trump has insisted that the U.S. would run Venezuela at least temporarily and tap its vast oil reserves to sell to other nations.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, however, says the U.S. would enforce an oil quarantine that was already in place on sanctioned tankers and use that leverage to press policy changes in Venezuela.\n\nThis article has been changed to correct the spelling of Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia's name.",

Experts have said that the move could reshape the global energy market, disadvantaging China and Russia.\n\n\"They were pumping almost nothing by comparison to what they could have been,\" Trump said in a public address.\n\nTrump's comments followed an early Saturday raid in which US armed forces and law enforcement struck parts of the capital, Caracas, and captured Maduro and his wife.\n\nIn Monday's NBC interview, Trump said, \"Having a Venezuela that's an oil producer is good for the United States because it keeps the price of oil down.\"\n\nLower oil prices could mean cheaper gas for average Americans, but may also disincentivize the \"very large United States oil companies\" that Trump said he may subsidize.\n\nTrump added it was \"too soon\" to say whether he had spoken to executives at Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips, America's three largest oil producers.\n\nThe oil market has been under pressure, with crude prices falling 20% last year.

A $5 fee here, a $10 fee there — what seems small adds up quickly.\"\n\nHis first order targeted fees that \"do not meaningfully contribute to the service\" and are hidden until after the purchase has been made, the release said.\n\nThe second order took aim at what Mamdani called \"subscription traps and tricks,\" including free trials that automatically convert into paid plans, and subscriptions disguised as one-time purchases. The order also talked about subscriptions that make cancellations \"intentionally difficult.\"\n\nDuring his speech, Mamdani was accompanied by Sam Levine, his newly appointed commissioner of New York City's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Levine previously served as a director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection.\n\nTo combat junk fees, Mamdani announced that he would establish a citywide junk fee task force to crack down on offending businesses.\n\nIn 2023, the Biden administration also took aim at junk fees. In his State of the Union address in February 2023, former President Joe Biden criticized hidden hotel fees and surcharges on purchases, such as plane tickets.\n\nIn May 2025, the FTC announced a new rule on unfair or deceptive fees, which prohibits \"bait-and-switch\" pricing and misrepresentation of fees for live-event tickets and short-term lodging.\n\nMamdani was sworn in as New York's first Muslim mayor on January 1.

    "description": "Here are the highlights from the world's largest technology trade show happening in Las Vegas, including a new Nvidia chip architecture.",
    "fullText": "The tech scene is starting the year off strong.\n\nOn January 6, the Consumer Electronics Show, the largest and most influential technology trade show, is set to kick off in Las Vegas.\n\nA CES keynote presentation of a new chip from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang already got the show started.\n\nBased on early announcements, the audience can expect novelties this year like the Sweekar AI pet that physically grows, robots that can bend backwards, and a wallpaper TV that is only 0.35 inches thick. Business Insider's Lloyd Lee is also on the scene to report on the latest autonomous vehicle technologies.\n\nFollow this post over the rest of the week to keep up with the most groundbreaking tech at the 2026 CES.\n\nOn Monday, ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show, Huang officially introduced the Vera Rubin architecture, which is now in production and expected to ramp up in volume in the second half of the year. This move follows a blockbuster year for its Blackwell chip, as demand for AI infrastructure continued to surge.\n\nIn a press briefing ahead of Huang's keynote, Dion Harris, Nvidia's senior director of HPC and AI infrastructure solutions, described Vera Rubin as \"six chips that make one AI supercomputer.\"\n\n\"Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing,\" Huang told the audience during a presentation at the CES.\n\nHuang added that compared to the Blackwell model, Rubin marks a leap in performance, with more than triple the speed, could run inference five times faster, and can deliver significantly more inference compute per watt of energy.\n\nRubin was first announced in 2024 and has been slated to replace Blackwell ever since. The early debut comes months ahead of the late-2026 timeline Nvidia had previously projected.\n\nNamed after astronomer Vera Rubin, who discovered the existence of dark matter, Nvidia said in a press release that the architecture is designed to support more complex, agent-style AI workloads, as well as more networking and data movement.\n\nThe Rubin systems are already lined up for deployment across much of the cloud industry. Nvidia said partners, including Amazon Web Services, OpenAI, Anthropic, alongside the upcoming Doudna system at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, all plan to use the new platform.\n\nThe accelerated launch comes shortly after Nvidia reported record data center revenue, up 66% from a year earlier, driven largely by demand for Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Those chips have become a benchmark for the current AI boom are widely seen as a test of whether spending on AI infrastructure is sustainable.\n\nHuang has previously estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion could be spent globally on AI infrastructure over the next five years. Nvidia said products and services built on the Rubin platform will begin rolling out from partners in the second half of 2026.\n\nNvidia's Huang also used his presentation to unveil Alpamayo, a new open AI model and toolset designed to bring reasoning to autonomous vehicles.\n\nHuang said that Mercedes-Benz cars powered by the system are already expected to hit the road in the first quarter of 2026.\n\n\"Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,\" said Huang.\n\nAlpamayo is Nvidia's first full-stack push into self-driving technology, with the goal of using vision-language-action models to handle rare and unfamiliar driving scenarios.\n\nMercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius said during the presentation that he recently tested the Nvidia-powered system on public roads and drove for more than an hour through heavy traffic.\n\n\"It feels that the car is on rails. You're just driving, and it does everything,\" Källenius said. \"If you're moving an object that weighs 4,000 pounds at 50 miles an hour, sorry is not going to cut it.\"\n\nBoston Dynamics is teaming up with Google DeepMind to integrate the Gemini AI into its humanoid robot, Atlas, and its robot dog called Spot. Unveiled with Boston Dynamics's parent company, Hyundai Motor Group, at CES on Monday, the partnership aims to let Atlas understand natural-language commands, adapt on the fly, and interact more naturally with people, with the goal of pushing the machine from lab demos into real-world work.\n\nExecutives of Boston Dynamics said in a press release that by embedding a foundation model, Atlas could move beyond preprogrammed actions to navigating unfamiliar environments and identifying and manipulating objects, all of which are core skills for manual labor.\n\n\"Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works,\" said CEO Robert Playter in the press release, \"And it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children—useful robots that can walk into our homes and help make our lives safer, more productive, and more fulfilling.\"",

    "description": "The \"Huberman Lab\" podcast host says good health comes down to \"intentionally high cortisol in the morning and intentionally low cortisol at night.\"",
    "fullText": "Stanford neuroscientist Andrew Huberman says one morning habit plays a key role in his overall health.\n\nIn an interview with GQ published on Monday, the host of the popular \"Huberman Lab\" podcast shared the routines he's relying on to stay healthy in 2026.\n\n\"Getting your physical health right — which puts your mental health in the best possible place — is all about intentionally high cortisol in the morning and intentionally low cortisol at night,\" Huberman told GQ.\n\nAlthough cortisol has a bad reputation as a stress hormone, Huberman says it plays an important role in how the body transitions from sleep to wakefulness.\n\n\"No, you wake up in the morning because of a rise in cortisol. You want a big, massive spike of cortisol in the morning. If you don't spike your morning cortisol, your cortisol spikes in the afternoon or evening, and then everything goes awry, OK? You want your morning cortisol at least 30x higher than your nighttime cortisol,\" he said.\n\nOne way to keep that rhythm on track would be to send the body a signal.\n\n\"The best way to spike your morning cortisol is to get bright light — ideally from sunlight — in your eyes in the first hour after waking. If you can't do that, maybe invest in a 10,000 Lux artificial light,\" Huberman said.\n\nIf that's not possible, he suggests flipping on \"as many artificial lights as you can.\"\n\n\"I've made a mistake in the past — a tactical mistake, a strategic mistake — by calling it sunlight. People say, 'It's overcast.' What we should say is, 'Get daylight in your eyes,'\" he said.\n\nHaving dim mornings and bright nights is \"the worst way to go,\" he added.\n\nLight exposure isn't the only thing Huberman says matters in the morning. He also encourages people to fit in a workout if they can.\n\n\"If you don't have time to exercise first thing in the morning, you need bodily movement. Even some knee bends, some arm swings, some jumping jacks. Movement generates cortisol and adrenaline,\" he said.\n\nWhen it comes to winding down at night, people should take the opposite approach, Huberman said.\n\n\"If you want to wear BluBlockers, you can. But dim the lights down, avoid caffeine. If you're going to exercise, don't make it terribly intense,\" he said.\n\nThe benefits of getting light in the mornings are supported by broader research in the field.\n\nMariana Figueiro, professor and director of the Light and Health Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told Business Insider in 2023 that getting daylight is \"just as important as diet and exercise.\"\n\n\"Light in the built environment is not always strong enough to synchronize the biological clock,\" Figueiro said. \"The beauty of daylight is that daylight is the right amount, it's the right color, it's on at the right time.\"\n\nMoreover, getting enough darkness at night is just as crucial, since circadian disruption has been linked to poor cognitive performance and a weakened immune system, Figueiro said.",

    "title": "CES 2026: This Water Dispenser Uses Facial Recognition to Track Your Cats' Drinking Habits",
    "description": "If you have more than one cat, it can track them all.",
    "fullText": "I spent some time with Petkit on the show floor of CES on Monday, where I got to see the company's automatic wet food cat feeder, its newest smart litter box, as well as an AI-powered water dispenser. Of course, a water dispenser should ideally do one thing: dispense fresh water for your pet. The Eversweet Ultra water dispenser, however, adds a number of smart features to the mix, some of which actually seem particular useful for owners of multiple cats.\n\nI first learned about this water dispenser last week when Petkit officially announced it, and some of the specs and features are the same on paper as they are in person: This smart dispenser comes with a five-liter tank, as well as a 1080p camera with a 140-degree-wide-angle view. That allows you to see your cat approach the dispenser, as well as monitor their drinking habits. You can either choose to tap into a live stream to watch them as they drink, or check out prerecorded clips saved to the app. Petkit tells me the app even chops up clips for you to post to your socials automatically—if you think your friends and family want close-ups of your cat taking a drink.\n\nOne of Petkit's selling points here, however, is the health tracking. The clips aren't just for posting to stories; instead, the camera can track how your pet drinks over time, noting any discrepancies or changes. You can see daily, monthly, and even yearly drinking trends, so you know whether your cat is drinking an abnormal amount of water for January. I'd want to consult a veterinarian before definitively stating whether this type of tracking is effective, but I can imagine it might be useful to know whether your cat changes its behaviors—something you might not notice if you aren't diligently watching them drink.\n\nThat doesn't change if you have multiple cats, either. The Eversweet's camera uses machine learning for facial recognition, and can identify individual cats in your home. That health tracking can apply to specific cats as they drink water, so you shouldn't have results mixed between your various pets. If you really want to know when one cat is drinking water over another, this should help you keep track.\n\nWhile some water dispensers recycle the water, the Eversweet disposes of the water after a set period of time. I knew about this from the press release, but it was fun seeing the machine dump the water in real time: The pump that serves to keep the water running cuts out, and the entire mechanism lifts up to reveal a drain. The water dumps out, and a spout refills the tank, only to dump the water again. This is an attempt to clean out the tray, and remove any bits of hair or debris that might've been left behind.\n\nPetkit also made a point of showing me that the dispenser's pump is always running, which turns the Eversweet into a bit of a water feature—not that you should buy one just for decoration. The idea is, cats are a bit more attracted to the moving water than still water, which encourages them to drink. I don't have a cat, so I can't speak to that, but it's an added aesthetic perk—until the water dumps out, of course.\n\nPetkit says it's aiming for an April release for the Eversweet, which will be available on both Amazon as well as through Petkit's official site.",

    "title": "CES 2026: AMD Just Showed Off 'Helios,' the Hardware That Will Power the AI Content in Your Feeds",
    "description": "\"The world's best AI rack.\"",
    "fullText": "When you come across an AI video on Instagram, or watch ChatGPT respond to your query, do you ever think about how that content was generated? Beyond the actual programs and prompts, generative AI takes an enormous amount of compute to support, especially as it skyrockets in popularity. As such, AI companies are looking for more power than ever, which means, of course, turning to those that make the hardware.\n\nDuring a Monday evening keynote, AMD's CEO Dr. Lisa Su showed off the hardware that will soon power everything from ChatGPT to the AI videos overwhelming your feeds. Su introduced \"Helios\" against a backdrop of dramatic music, the company's upcoming AI rack, that packs a staggering amount of computing power into a rack that weighs nearly 7,000 pounds.\n\nEach \"cross-section\" of these racks, if you will, is powered by four key AMD pieces of hardware: The company's new AMD Instinct MI455X GPU, the new AMD EPYC \"Veince\" CPU, the AMD Pensando \"Vulcano\" 800 AI NIC, and the AMD Pensando \"Salina\" 400 DPU. There are some staggering stats here: Helios is capable of 2.9 exaflops of AI compute, and comes with 31 TB of HBM4 memory. It offers 43 TB per second scale out Bandwidth, and is developed with 2nm and 3nm architecture. The rack has 4,600 \"Zen 6\" CPU cores, and 18,000 GPU compute units. In other words, this isn't your average piece of hardware.\n\nSu's pitch is that the AI industry is in need of this additional compute power. She notes how the world used one ZettaFlop of computing power in 2022 on AI technology, compared to 100 ZettaFlops in 2025. (For the curious, one ZettaFlop has a value of 10 to the power of 21.) It's no surprise: AI is everywhere, and many of us are using it—whether we know it or not. Some of us are using it overtly, generating AI videos or running chatbots daily. But others are using AI quietly embedded in functions, like live translation.\n\nSu welcomed reps from OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, and Luma AI, which creates generative AI video content, to talk about how additional compute helps their programs. But during Luma AI's demonstration of its hyperrealistic video generations, all I could think about was how this type of content is already tricking people into thinking its real, when it's entirely fabricated—not to mention the impact on human artists. AMD is optimistic about AI, and the data centers powering it, but critics have been pushing back, citing concerns with the impacts on the communities companies are building these data centers in.\n\nHelios will likely be a major success for AMD, but it comes at an interesting time for tech, and AI in general. AI is more popular than ever, but it's also more controversial than ever. I see hardware like Helios only fueling the fire in both directions.\n\nIn addition to Helios, Su announced the AMD Ryzen AI 400 series. These newest chips comes with either 12 \"Zen 5\" CPU cores and 24 threads, 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores, a 60 TOPS XDNA 2 NPU, and memory speeds of 8,533 MT/s. AMD says the Ryzen AI 400 series is 1.7 times faster at content creation and 1.3 times faster at multitasking whe compared to Intel Core Ultra 9 288V.\n\nThese new chips will ship soon in a number of major PC brands, including Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Beelink, Colorful, Gigabyte, LG, Mechrevo, MSI, and NEC.",

    "description": "Who needs a screen?",
    "fullText": "If you're anything like me, you spend 90% of your time using your laptop with it docked and plugged into a monitor (or two). And if you're at that point, you might be wondering why you even bother having a screen attached to your computer at all. If so, HP's got your back. Announced at this year's CES, the HP Eliteboard G1a looks like a normal keyboard on the outside, but on the inside, it's got a whole Windows PC.\n\nThat's not exactly a new concept, but with the experimental days of Windows XP long behind us, it's mostly been reserved for less powerful, Linux-based single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi. That's great if you're a hacker or tinkerer, but not if you're just looking for a screenless, keyboard-equipped Mini PC to get you through the workday.\n\nThe Eliteboard G1a, instead, comes equipped with the latest AMD Ryzen AI chips, up to 64GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage, so while you shouldn't expect to play the latest and greatest games on it, for internet browsers and lightweight productivity programs, it should really be able to hustle.\n\nIt's also a bit of a sleeper build. I've been able to go hands-on with it, and to all outside eyes, it really does look like a regular office keyboard, complete with black, low-profile chiclet keys, a function row, and a numpad. Ranging from 1.5 to 1.7 pounds based on how you spec it out, it's also pretty lightweight, and the right person might believe you if you said it was just a keyboard, with no computer inside whatsoever.\n\nThe catch? This baby is aimed at enterprise customers, rather than your typical consumer. That does come with a few bonuses, like a Kensington lock slot, some extra security software, and an optional fingerprint reader. But it also means you're not going to find it up for sale anywhere other than the HP store, and while pricing hasn't been announced yet, it'll probably be a bit more expensive if bought individually rather than as part of an office fleet. It can also only connect to monitors using DisplayPort, which is fine if you're an office manager that knows to buy displays that will work with it, but may not fit into everyone's home set-up.\n\nThat's a shame, because I love unusual form factors, and this keyboard PC could make for a really clean desk in my home office. It's strong enough, uses a familiar operating system with wide app compatibility, and can even output to two 4K monitors at once. There are also two versions, one that always needs to be plugged in, and one with a battery and a detachable USB power cable for quickly moving between different workstations. That's great flexibility, since the battery version is a bit more portable, but is also heavier.\n\nHere's hoping this is just an early experiment for HP, because I'd love to buy a consumer version of this laptop at some point in the future. If you're willing to take the plunge on the enterprise model, though, HP says it's expected to launch on HP.com sometime in March.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Intel's New Chips Are Coming For Your Gaming Handhelds",
    "description": "Intel's got a new integrated GPU, and is promising better battery life.",
    "fullText": "Every year at CES, Intel and AMD announce their newest processors. This year, Intel debuted its first line of chips made with its 18a process, which stands for 18 angstroms, or under 2nm. To make that a little less nerdy, that means these chips can fit a lot of tech into a small area, which means big gains in performance.\n\nColloquially called Panther Lake, the new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips are focused on laptops and mini-PCs. But that doesn't mean they don't put out impressive numbers. During its keynote, Intel promised \"77% faster gaming performance,\" and for everyone actually using their PCs to do work, \"60% better multithread performance.\" Impressively, it also said its new chips would also enable \"up to 27 hours of battery life,\" rivaling Apple's M-series chips and other ARM chips from manufacturers like Qualcomm. Battery life has been a sore spot for both Intel and AMD for a while, and I'm excited to get my hands on machines that use Panther Lake processors.\n\nAnd then there's the AI. Intel says its top Intel Core Ultra Series 3 models have 50 NPU TOPs and 180 TOPS in total when you combine the NPU and GPU numbers. To translate, that basically means faster AI performance for developers who don't want to bother with the cloud, and would prefer the speed and privacy of a locally downloaded AI model.\n\nSpeaking of that GPU, Intel's upgraded its integrated graphics this generation to the Intel Arc B390, which has twice the cache of its prior GPU and 50% more cores. I already mentioned that 77% increase in gaming performance, but AI developers will also see a 53% increase in performance over Intel Core Ultra Series 2, and a two times performance increase over Intel Core Ultra Series 1.\n\nSo, better computers. That's pretty par for the course for CES, but there is a \"one more thing\" here. Intel is coming for AMD's dominance in handheld gaming PCs.\n\nUntil now, most handheld gaming PCs have used AMD chips, with those that have opted for Intel getting hit in reviews for buggy or poorly optimized performance. The Steam Deck uses an AMD chip, and so does the Xbox handheld. Intel says it's going to change that.\n\nAfter announcing the new integrated GPU and walking through features like frame generation and ray tracing, the company said it \"will be launching an entire handheld gaming platform with Panther Lake.\"\n\nThat means big moves, and soon—Panther Lake won't last long before getting replaced. The company didn't say much more, but it did show a slide with partners set to use Intel chips in their handhelds, including Acer, MSI, and hey, Microsoft. I guess we'll see another Xbox handheld model soon.\n\nAnd that's about it for Intel this year. The new chips are smaller, stronger, and more efficient, but smartly, the company is also planning to use them to shore up its weaknesses, specifically in gaming and battery life. That makes sense. With developers like Apple having famously ditched Intel throughout the decade, the company has been on the backfoot.\n\nAccording to Intel, the earliest machines powered by Intel Core Ultra Series 3 will start accepting pre-orders on January 6, with availability beginning on January 27.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Sony's Keynote This Year Was All About Electric Cars",
    "description": "The Sony Honda Mobility Afeela 1 is finally coming out.",
    "fullText": "At last year's CES, Sony's press conference showed off products from all over its portfolio, including a first look at The Last of Us season 2. This year, it was all about the Afeela, an electric car Sony's making in collaboration with Honda that it's been teasing for years, but is now finally getting ready to release.\n\nSony has big plans for Afeela. Previews have been less about hard specs like mileage or speed and more about the company's plans to change how we look at cars. Previously, that's included demo'ing integrations with other Sony services like Crunchyroll and themes for the car's interior based on Sony brands. Just last month, the company confirmed it would support PlayStation Remote Play in the Afeela, after teasing it at CES 2024. And the first time I saw the Afeela at CES, it was driven onto stage using a PS5 controller.\n\nNow, Sony's ready to talk more than aesthetics and cute integrations, but that unique voice didn't go anywhere. Headlining the show was the promise that the company's currently working on something called Afeela Intelligent Drive. Currently, it's sitting at level 2+ driver assistance, which means it can handle tasks like merging or lane changes, but Sony's planning to take it to level 4+ \"in the future,\" meaning full self-driving within certain areas. It probably won't be ready for launch, but it does show the company's getting serious about usability.\n\nOn that note, it also showed concepts for a future where Afeela users will basically just chill while the car drives itself. Those kind of promises aren't rare at CES, but Sony specifically called out its brand of entertainment products as what riders would occupy themselves with on their rides. Combined with the Intelligent Drive news, apparently that's what all those ecosystem cross-promotions were leading towards.\n\nBut until that future arrives, Sony still isn't afraid to use Afeela to push its products, although it isn't stopping there. The company brought PlayStation on stage to quickly reaffirm Remote Play will be baked into the Afeela (while also dropping the surprising stat that apparently half of all PlayStation Remote Play sessions now happen on the PlayStation Portal streaming handheld). It also said that the Afeela will have themes for its touchscreens based on Sony properties like Astro Bot and Gran Turismo. None of that is too far off from what the company's shown before, but the idea of turning your car into a media ecosystem doesn't stop there. Sony also announced the Afeela co-creation program, which will let developers and content creators make their own custom apps or media for the car.\n\nThese include things like themes and even special Android apps, but apparently, drivers can even customize the Afeela's \"motor\" sound, and put visuals on a small \"media bar\" on the front of the car. As an example, Sony brought out Japanese music producer Tomoko Ida, who demonstrated a motor sound she created that sounded more like a THX commercial than anything else.\n\nIt's honestly a pretty clever move for a car that's been all about the ecosystem as opposed to the hard specs so far. But it does have one oddity that maybe speaks to how long this thing's been teased. Apparently, developers for the Co-Creation program will be able to get paid in crypto, which Sony says will \"accelerate open co-creation,\" although it also says the Co-Creation program will be \"open to other automakers and service providers.\" I'm not sure Toyota will want to get paid on the blockchain, but whatever.\n\nDrivers will be able to access utilities and apps made for their Afeela using an app, but that raises the question: When will you finally be able to drive this thing?\n\nThe Afeela has been teased since CES 2023, but finally Sony says the car is in production and will begin delivering to customers in California sometime this year. In fact, all the photos you've seen of the Afeela throughout this article have been of an actual pre-production model for the initial Afeela car, now called Afeela 1.\n\nThat's huge for Afeela, but there is a catch. Those deliveries might take a while to reach the rest of the country. Sony says Arizona is next on its radar, but that sales won't make it there until 2027. Japanese deliveries are also slated for 2027, but living in New York, I'll just have to keep pretending this thing doesn't exist.\n\nThat's a bit of a blow for a car that started off this press conference promising a new future for how we drive, since even once it gets on the streets, it'll probably take even longer for that to come true. Still, Sony says it will allow people who have already registered to buy a car to start doing test drives of the car sometime before deliveries begin.\n\nI'll be honest, I don't cover cars much, and that this year's Sony press conference was all about one maybe points to a quiet year across the rest of the brand. That said, for people who are into driving, I can see the Afeela's appeal. It definitely feels more like a gadget than a gas guzzler, and I'm wondering if this is what the Apple Car might have looked like if it ever came out.\n\nProbably not—despite the fancy mock-ups, I did sit inside an Afeela last year, and it was fancy but still familiar. But that's also not where Afeela is stopping. Sony ended its keynote by driving the \"Afeela Prototype 2026\" onto the stage. It didn't look that different from the outside, but the company says it will offer \"greater spatial flexibility and accessibility.\" To me, that implies a step closer towards that future where the car is essentially a hangout zone that moves you while you play PlayStation, but only time will tell. I'll see you when I actually get behind the wheel of one of these things, probably sometimes in 2040.",

    "fullText": "“Smart” glasses have been big at CES this year, but the headset that has impressed me most is a device that helps people with central vision loss, including those who are considered “legally blind,” to see what they otherwise couldn’t. At a press event, I met a woman with macular degeneration, Liz Baker, who uses them daily—and I got to try them myself.\n\nThe device is called eSight Go. It’s a headset with little screens in front of your eyes, sort of like a VR headset, but small enough to perch on your nose. The device’s battery pack sits around the back of your neck, so that you don’t have to support the weight of the battery on your head. The glasses are bulky, but the battery pack design made them comfortable for me to wear.\n\nThe device is designed for people with central vision loss, which includes conditions like macular degeneration. In these conditions, the middle of the person’s visual field isn’t clear—things they look directly at appear blurry or simply aren’t visible, but their peripheral vision is still clear.\n\nRegular eyewear can’t correct this issue, since the information in the center of the visual field just isn’t there. But the eSight device works by zooming in so much that the person’s peripheral vision is able to process what they’re seeing, and that central “blind spot” essentially disappears. The company’s studies show that people gain seven lines of improvement on vision charts—that’s huge.\n\nIt’s hard for me, as a sighted person, to know exactly what that’s like, but Baker gave me a few examples. With the device, she can read ingredient labels and see people’s facial features; without it, those things are literally a blur. She told me about noticing her daughter’s freckles when looking through the eSight device, and using it to shop without help. (Previously, small text at stores was impossible to read; she says she kept buying shampoo when she meant to buy conditioner.)\n\nThe device has a dizzying array of features that I wasn’t able to master in my short time with it. To name a few: You can zoom in and out with buttons on the arm of the headset, or with a handheld remote. You can increase the contrast of whatever you're looking at. You can freeze-frame, zoom in, and then move your head to read the enlarged image as if it were a giant billboard in front of you (even if it’s something small or far away, like a brochure in your hand or a menu on a restaurant wall.)\n\nThe device costs $4,950 and is not covered by most insurance. It comes with access to a “coach” who is themselves an eSight user with vision loss who can talk new users through learning the features or helping them to figure out how to do specific tasks.\n\nThe battery life on the eSight Go is about four hours, so I asked Baker how she keeps the device charged throughout the day. She says she doesn’t wear the glasses continuously, which saves battery life. She keeps them around her neck (essentially in a sleep mode) when she isn’t actively using them to read text or look at a specific thing in detail.\n\nDirector of sales Roland Mattern says people who test the glasses sometimes zoom all the way in and note that the image can be pixelated, but most users don’t need the max zoom level, and those who do tend to find that it’s still an improvement over what they can see without the glasses.\n\nThe hefty price isn’t usually covered by insurance, although the Department of Veterans Affairs will cover it, and Mattern says a few users with other insurance companies have sometimes managed to get coverage. Sometimes other programs can cover it, like state-run vocational rehabilitation programs that help people with disabilities return to work.",

    "description": "Could the Cubs land Edward Cabrera? We analyze potential trade packages, including top prospects, to acquire the Marlins' ace pitcher.",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Cubs continue to do their due diligence on several players this offseason.\n\nOver the past week, the Cubs have been linked to Alex Bregman, Bo Bichette, and Cody Bellinger in free agency. With the North Siders needing another impactful bat in their lineup, it’s not surprising to see them interested in so many of the top remaining bats on the open market.\n\nAnother name has also popped up in connection with the Cubs. This time, it’s a pitcher in the trade market.\n\nAccording to Jon Heyman of the New York Post, Chicago is reportedly interested in trading for Miami Marlins pitcher Edward Cabrera. Although the New York Yankees appear to be in deeper talks with the Marlins for Cabrera, the Cubs being mentioned here is significant.\n\nAfter failing to sign Tatsuya Imai in free agency, it appears the Cubs are now pivoting to the trade market. The front office was interested in trading for Cabrera at the 2025 Trade Deadline, but the Marlins' asking price was a bit too high.\n\nBut those trade talks have likely picked up since the Cubs missed out on Imai. The team still needs a frontline starting pitcher, and Cabrera would be the perfect answer for Chicago. He showed last year that he can be a reliable arm in any rotation.\n\nSo, what could a deal look like between the Cubs and the Marlins involving Cabrera?\n\nWe’ll use two different sources to identify who the Cubs might have to give up in any deal involving Cabrera.\n\nOur first source comes from Eric Hubbs of Barstool Sports. He reported that the Yankees could include No. 6 prospect Ben Hess and No. 16 prospect Dillon Lewis in any deal for Cabrera. FanSided insider Robert Murray actually gave Hubbs his flowers for accurately reporting that in an episode of the Baseball Insiders Podcast.\n\nOur second source comes from Baseball Trade Values. This site does a great job of comparing players’ trade values. With Cabrera having a 27.6 value in their model, we can identify who the Cubs need to give up for the right-hander.\n\nEven though the Yankees are only said to be giving up their No. 6 and No. 16 prospect, it likely would cost the Cubs a lot more to acquire Cabrera. Both Hess and Lewis have a ton of potential, and both are rising stars in New York’s farm system.\n\nFor the Cubs, giving up No. 3 prospect Jaxon Wiggins and No. 5 prospect Kevin Alcantara could complete the deal. Both Wiggins' (21.3) and Alcantara’s (7.3) trade values in that model basically equal Cabrera’s trade value (28.6).\n\nThe Marlins would essentially get two ready-now players who have plenty of potential, and the Cubs would get a top-of-the-line starting pitcher who still has three years of control remaining. Cabrera isn’t a free agent until after the 2028 season.\n\nHowever, it all depends on whether the Cubs would actually deal Wiggins in any trade for Cabrera. The team’s top pitching prospect is set to contribute to the Major League club at some point in 2026 and projects to be a dominant rotation arm.",

    "description": "Daniel Cormier lauds Jake Paul for being brave, but doesn't think he's very smart.",
    "fullText": "Daniel Cormier lauds Jake Paul for being brave, but doesn't think he's very smart.\n\nPaul was knocked out by former two-time unified heavyweight champion and Olympic gold medalist Anthony Joshua in Round 6 of their boxing match at Kaseya Center in Miami last month.\n\nThe loss resulted in Paul breaking his jaw in two places, but that hasn't stopped the 28-year-old, who immediately turned his attention to Francis Ngannou.\n\n\"Jake Paul just got his head bashed in by Anthony Joshua, right? That was about as big a learning lesson that anyone could have been taught,\" Cormier said on his YouTube channel. \"Here's the problem: Jake Paul has proven to be, one, hard-headed; two, more bold and brave than anyone could have ever imagined – bold and brave because he fought Anthony Joshua to begin with.\n\n\"Bold and brave because they didn't put any things in place to make sure Anthony didn't do exactly what he did to him, broke his jaw in multiple places, got him sucking out of a straw. It would seem like his bold and brave attitude really cost him. And with that bold and brave attitude a lot of the times comes cowardice after. Not Jake Paul. Not Jake Paul. You can love him, you can hate him, but he's brave.\"\n\nCormier is shocked to see Paul go after Ngannou, who almost beat Tyson Fury, but also got knocked out by Joshua.\n\n\"I would have thought, I swear to God, I would have thought that after what happened with Anthony Joshua, Jake Paul would say, 'OK, let me rematch Anderson (Silva) or somebody,\" Cormier said. \"You would have thought Jake Paul would go, 'You know what? I'm going to rematch Anderson, maybe I will find another mixed marital arts guy that's a little bit over the hill to try to fight where it's more safe and it's a more controlled environment because the problem with the Anthony Joshua fight is it wasn't controlled. It was just a fight. That's not Jake Paul, though. He immediately goes back after Francis Ngannou. It's crazy to me.\"\n\nWhen Gervonta Davis withdrew from his fight against Paul, \"The Problem Child\" called out Ngannou, but Ngannou wasn't interested. Joshua ended up taking the fight instead, which Cormier thinks would now make Ngannou open to fighting Paul.\n\nHowever, Cormier thinks it would be a bad idea for Paul.\n\n\"For as small as Jake looked against Anthony, he'll look equally as small against Francis Ngannou,\" Cormier said. \"But I think what's happening with Jake is he's wanting to show that Anthony Joshua didn't knock scared into him, which in reality he probably should have knocked a little scared into him.\n\n\"I just don't think (Paul) can hurt him. I just don't know that he can hurt Francis like he thinks he can hurt Francis. You can never question the boldness of Jake Paul. You could never question the toughness of Jake Paul. I question his smarts. I think he needs to reconsider.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: UFC analyst warns Jake Paul of calling out Francis Ngannou",

Here’s the full breakdown:\n\nAfter an underwhelming season, the Ravens will have some major questions over the offseason. Will John Harbaugh still be on the sideline in Baltimore at the start of next season? We’ll have to wait and see.

    "description": "The Bengals' offseason seems to be setting up exactly as needed: With every possible opportunity to focus on the defense.",
    "fullText": "It's early in the NFL offseason for teams that missed the playoffs, but the Cincinnati Bengals' offseason seems to be setting up exactly as needed: With every possible opportunity to focus on the defense.\n\nThat starts with continuity on the coaching staff, and the fact that Al Golden will likely return as the team's defensive coordinator. After receiving the backing of team owner and President Mike Brown earlier in the day, head coach Zac Taylor voiced his support for Golden during a Jan. 5 news conference at Paycor Stadium and said he did not plan any staff changes.\n\nPersonnel-wise, there's plenty of business the Bengals can get done on the offensive side of the ball, including extending the contracts of players like 1,000-yard running Chase Brown. But the key offensive cogs are locked up for next year. There aren't any nagging contract situations that must be addressed, such as the past mega-deals for players like quarterback Joe Burrow and receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins.\n\nMost of the other skill position players and offensive linemen are locked up contractually. And the one unsigned lineman many players would like to see return, and who has voiced interest in returning, is Dalton Risner. Risner confirmed his interest in returning to Cincinnati during a Jan. 4 interview with The Enquirer.\n\nOn the defensive side of the ball, there doesn't appear to be any lingering contract issues that would cast a pall on the offseason like Trey Hendrickson's did last year.\n\nIn short, the Bengals can pour much of their focus into the defense, which ended 2025 ranked No. 31 out of 32 teams in total defense.\n\n\"That’s the truth of it. There’s no real sugarcoating that. You got a bunch of (defensive) guys coming back,\" Taylor said. \"It’s exciting because you can focus your energy. There’s so many guys on that side of the ball that, really, their growth was accelerated over the last half of the year. You are really excited about their future here as starters (and) as role players. I feel like we are in a tremendous position going into this offseason.\n\n\"Our expectations are going to be sky high, and we are going to work like heck to meet those expectations. I think the players and coaches all see the direction we are headed. So there is a lot of positive energy heading into the offseason.\"\n\nTaylor on Jan. 5 continued to trumpet the statistical defensive improvement under Golden following Cincinnati's Nov. 9 bye week, although the team went 3-5 during that stretch and lost three one-score games. Bengals' offensive turnovers leading to opposition touchdowns also played a role in several of those games. Golden's unit didn't have much to do with those moments.\n\nTaylor also offered insight into a shorter runway for Golden to onboard with the Bengals following his run as Notre Dame's defensive coordinator for the College Football Playoff. That run ran all the way through to the National Championship game in Atlanta on Jan. 20, 2025. The Bengals then hired Golden and started to take meaningful steps in assembling the defensive coaching staff around him.\n\nThere were times it felt like the Bengals were one missed tackle or one play of some kind from winning. Instead, they more often than not let those games get away. Several players on Jan. 5 said they viewed that perspective as evidence the team is close.\n\nSimilarly, Taylor said he believed the defense was close to being where he needed it to be.\n\n\"I think that staff really worked hard to come together and get on the same page with scheme and how we're going to coach these guys,\" Taylor said. \"So, like anything, I saw great growth from that side of the ball. And they closed (by) giving up 18 points or something a game over the last eight games. And there's a lot of statistics I can read where it shows marked improvement. And so again, I like the direction that group is headed. I like the direction our team is headed. I know how it sounds when we come off the record we just had, but again, I've got a lot of excitement, and I'm excited to get back to work and get these guys ready for next year.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Zac Taylor said no Bengals' coaching staff changes are planned",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M landed its seventh transfer addition since the portal opened on Monday afternoon, securing its second offensive line commitment, as South Carolina guard Trovon Baugh will head to College Station this spring, and I can safely say that this one came out of nowhere. After landing LSU guard and former Texas A&M commit Coen Echols, head coach Mike Elko has added more beef in the trenches.\n\nWith starting left tackle Trey Zuhn, right guard Ar'maj Reed-Adams, and right tackle Dametreous Crownover all departing for the NFL Draft, landing two experienced offensive linemen was crucial before entering the spring season, while left guard Chase Bisontis has yet to decide his playing future. For those who aren't familiar with Baugh, he started 11 of 12 games at right guard for the Gamecocks last season, logging 611 snaps, while his overall performance is a mixed bag with more positives than negatives.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, Baugh earned average grades, but did finish the year with four 80-plus pass protection grades, and earned at least 50 or above grades as a run blocker, proving that there's still plenty of room for improvement. On paper, with Adams leaving, Baugh will likely compete with Coen Echols and sophomore guard Blake Ivy for the starting right guard spot.\n\nStanding at 6'3\" and 335 pounds, Baugh possesses NFL size and strength, but still needs to refine his technique to reach his full potential. Mike Elko has filled another gap in the roster.\n\nMore beef 🥩 \n\nWelcome to Aggieland, @BaughTrovon 👍 pic.twitter.com/To8BGNl1i2\n\n— TexAgs Recruiting (@TA_Recruiting) January 5, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M land commitment from South Carolina transfer OL Trovon Baugh",

    "fullText": "After a heartbreaking loss to Czechia last night, Vancouver Canucks prospect Braeden Cootes and Team Canada have won Bronze at the 2026 IIHF World Junior Championship, taking Finland down by a score of 6–3. This is Canada’s sixth bronze medal at the World Juniors and their 36th overall.\n\nThe past few World Junior Championships have been rough for Canada, as they have been eliminated from gold medal contention by Czechia for the past three straight years. Their last gold medal came in 2023, during which they took down none-other than Czechia to achieve the feat. Prior to this year, this was Canada’s last medal placement. The last time Canada placed third at the World Juniors was in 2012.\n\nThe 2026 World Junior Championship was an interesting one for Cootes, who played predominantly on Canada’s fourth line despite a decent showing at his team’s training camp. In today’s game, Cootes scored his second goal of the tournament and played in a total of 6:21 minutes. He finishes the tournament with two goals, seven shots on goal, and an average of 8:48 minutes played per game.\n\nWith Canada and Finland’s bronze-medal game now wrapped up, fans’ attention will turn to Canucks prospect Wilson Björck and Team Sweden as they take on Czechia for gold.

He had previously served as Kansas City's quarterbacks coach from 2013 until 2015, and was the Chiefs' offensive coordinator in 2016 and 2017.\n\nThe #Titans are off and running, requesting to interview #Chiefs OC Matt Nagy for their HC job.\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 5, 2026\n\nWhile Rapoport's report indicated that Tennessee is \"requesting to interview\" Nagy, the veteran coordinator's contract expires at the end of the 2025 season, at which point he will become a free agent.\n\nStay tuned to see if Nagy will land with the Titans — and who the Chiefs might tab to replace him in the event that he leaves Kansas City in the offseason.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Titans request interview with Chiefs OC Matt Nagy for vacant HC job",

    "description": "The Reds have a bright future.",
    "fullText": "The Cincinnati Reds feature a number of young players with high ceilings. It is easy to forget that Elly De La Cruz is still only 23 years old. Today, however, we are going to take a look at three of the Reds' top prospects and break down their skill sets, potential and MLB outlooks.\n\nStewart, a 22-year-old versatile infielder, made his MLB debut in 2025. He was also the Reds' top prospect in 2025, per MLB.com.\n\nStewart is known for his hitting prowess, while his defensive versatility makes him an especially intriguing prospect. He's developing as a power threat, and Stewart is a guy who could hit for a quality average at the big league level.\n\nBetween Double-A and Triple-A in 2025, Stewart slashed .309/.383/.525 while also recording a .907 OPS and 20 home runs. His 18 MLB games saw him hit .255/.293/.545 with five home runs and an .838 OPS.\n\nHe features the talent and potential to become the next star in Cincinnati.\n\nDuno, the No. 2 prospect for the Reds in 2025, is a 19-year-old catcher. With an MLB ETA of 2028, Duno is still working toward becoming big league ready. It would not be surprising to see him become the team's catcher of the future down the road, though.\n\nIn 2025 at Single-A, Duno slashed .287/.430/.518 to go along with 18 home runs and a .948 OPS. While it was only Single-A ball, Duno is seemingly ready for the next level given his performance.\n\nWhile his offensive ability is clearly trending in the right direction, Duno's throwing arm from behind the plate may be the best facet of his game. Opponents are going to have a difficult time attempting to steal bases with Duno as the backstop.\n\nLewis, a 19-year-old shortstop who was the Reds' No. 3 overall prospect in 2025, may have to switch positions at some point in the future with De La Cruz at shortstop with the MLB team. An athletic infielder who stands 6'2\", a position move would likely not be an issue for Lewis.\n\nHe has a good arm, but his defense is still a work-in-progress. Lewis is still progressing offensively, but his 2025 performance was impressive. He slashed .311/.376/.486 with an .862 OPS, nine home runs and 27 stolen bases at Single-A.\n\nLewis is going to steal bases. The question is whether or not he will hit at a consistent enough level to become a star at the big league level. If he does turn into a respectable offensive presence, Lewis should have a bright future with the Reds moving forward.",

    "fullText": "MANHATTAN — Right when you thought Kansas State football might be done for the day, the Wildcats landed a seventh commitment from the transfer portal on Monday, Jan. 5.\n\nGardner-Webb defensive tackle De'Arieun Hicks committed to K-State, according to On3's Pete Nakos. The 6-foot-4, 285-pounder has three years of eligibility and totaled 21 tackles, with 4.5 being for a loss in 2025.\n\nHicks reportedly had a visit to Iowa State on Monday, after spending Jan. 3 with the Wildcats, and he chose to play football in Manhattan.\n\nHicks was a standout for the FCS program out of the Big South, playing 373 snaps and making four starts on the Runnin' Bulldogs' defensive line. He was the Big South's sixth-highest graded defensive lineman, according to Pro Football Focus, with the league's 12th-best pass rush grade.\n\nHicks totaled 10 pressures, with seven quarterback hurries and a pair of sacks across 12 games.\n\nOut of high school in Richmond, Indiana, Hicks wasn't given a grade by 247Sports.\n\nKansas State was in desperate need of defensive linemen from the transfer portal following the departures of Malcolm Alcorn-Crowder and Andy Burburija, the latter of whom reopened his recruitment after initially signing with the Wildcats. The Wildcats also signed Adrian Bekibele, Kingston Hall and Carnell Jackson Jr. during December's signing period.\n\nHicks' size is certainly appealing, giving the Wildcats a solid prospect to develop. Given the Wildcats' need at the position, Hicks could have an opportunity to get on the field quickly.\n\nHicks joins Oklahoma State running back Rodney Fields Jr., Texas A&M receiver Izaiah Williams, Illinois corner Kaleb Patterson, Oklahoma State linebacker Jacobi Oliphant, Miami (Ohio) safety Koy Beasley and Missouri offensive lineman Keiton Jones as those who committed to the Wildcats on Monday.\n\nWyatt D.

    "description": "In the midst of growing speculation surrounding Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles, his players are showing him plenty of support.",
    "fullText": "One of the biggest question marks as the NFL enters its offseason surrounds the future of Todd Bowles as head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Speculation has been mounting, at least among the public, about whether or not the franchise should bring Bowles back for a fifth season in charge following another 8-9 season and missing the playoffs for the first time since 2019.\n\nThere is at least one group of people that is fully supportive of Bowles and that is the players of the Buccaneers organization.\n\nThat starts with one of the anchors of the offensive line, offensive tackle Tristan Wirfs.\n\n“I love coach Bowles,” Wirfs said about Bowles. “I see all the talk on Twitter, I really don't care about it — it's just people sitting at home, talking about it. We know what we have in this building. If something happens, something happens, if something doesn't, something doesn't. The season is coming regardless, and we're all gonna be ready.”\n\nTristan Wirfs speaks on the future of Todd Bowles with Bucs. \n\n“I see all of the talk on Twitter. I really don’t care about it. \n\nIf something happens, something happens. If something doesn’t, something doesn’t.” pic.twitter.com/2CPVlFk2Ey\n\n— Logan B. Robinson (@LogansTwitty) January 5, 2026\n\nAnother player that added support for Bowles coming back is second-year wide receiver Jalen McMillan, who battled a neck injury throughout the season.\n\n“He's a great leader,” McMillan said, via River Wells. “He's somebody who shows up to work every day and he's going to give you the same type of effort, every day. He's my guy. I love him to death. Hopefully, he stays here.”\n\nJalen McMillan on increasing chatter on Todd Bowles’ job security:\n\n“He’s my guy. I love him to death. I hope he stays here.” pic.twitter.com/5YKeeE2Dgj\n\n— River Wells (@riverhwells) January 5, 2026\n\nIt was a disappointing finish for the Buccaneers. After a 5-1 start and a 6-2 first half of the season, the wheels completely fell off and the Buccaneers would win just two of their last nine games.\n\nThey finished the season with a win over the Carolina Panthers but the Atlanta Falcons, who are also now looking for a head coach after firing Raheem Morris Sunday, then defeated the New Orleans Saints on Sunday to create a three-way tie atop the NFC South, a tie that did not favor the Buccaneers and left them on the outside looking in.\n\nAs a result, they will now look ahead to the draft with the 15th overall pick. The question is whether or not Bowles will help make that draft pick.\n\nHis players clearly want him to stay. But ultimately, ownership has the final say. It’s looking more like the team will keep Bowles for another season, but things can change quickly.",

    "fullText": "After Travis Kelce exited the field solemnly on Sunday night in Las Vegas after the Kansas City Chiefs fell for the final time this NFL season, there was one question on every fan, pundit, and probably even player’s mind:\n\nWas that the last game Travis Kelce ever played?\n\nOn Monday, we have somewhat of an answer, albeit one many fans might not have wanted to hear.\n\nFollowing the team’s game, Kelce shuffled into the locker room and was faced with questions from the media about his future plans with the Chiefs and if he had already decided on his future.\n\nKelce admitted that after the Chiefs' Super Bowl loss last year, he instantly knew he would be back with the Chiefs the next season. He wasn’t going to let his career end that way, and he was motivated that night to return to play with the only franchise he’s ever known.\n\nAfter the Raiders' loss, however, he was much more split. He explained that he doesn’t know at the moment when he will decide what he will do for the rest of the year regarding football.\n\nOne of the most successful players on and off the field, Kelce is scheduled to marry his partner, world pop star Taylor Swift, this coming June in Rhode Island.\n\nHe also hosts one of the most popular podcasts in North America, “New Heights” with his brother, retired NFL lineman and fellow Super Bowl champion Jason Kelce.\n\nEven Travis’ mother, Donna, is set to make her big television debut in only a few days on “The Traitors,” a competitive reality show produced by NBC on Peacock.\n\nWe will keep you updated on Kelce’s decision on whether he will play his 14th season in the NFL or if Sunday was his last dance.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Did Travis Kelce Retire From NFL, Chiefs After Week 18 Loss?",

    "fullText": "EAGAN, Minn. (AP) — The Minnesota Vikings lost their bet this season that they could develop J.J. McCarthy and still win at the same time, with a roster strong enough to withstand the typical inconsistencies of a young quarterback in his debut.\n\nThe worst part of their failed gamble for 2025 was that it left plenty more mystery for 2026. The Vikings have begun a new year with yet another quarterback quandary, a familiar scenario for this star-crossed franchise.\n\nAsked after the final game on Sunday if he would be comfortable entering next season with McCarthy as the starter, coach Kevin O'Connell sidestepped the question.\n\n“I can’t wait to work with him in the offseason and absolutely look forward to the continued development and improvement,\" O'Connell said, \"and I’m excited where he’s ending the season and know there’s some things we can really dive into as a group.”\n\nThe Vikings made sure not to miss out on the record quarterback rush at the top of the 2024 draft, confidently selecting McCarthy with the 10th pick as the promising prospect for their reputable system they could mold into a long-term fixture at this vital and vexing position.\n\nBut his injuries have put them behind on the evaluation. The fact that he has only started 10 games and finished eight over his first two years is the most concerning of any metric. Even when he was healthy, the struggles with accuracy were pronounced enough to make them consider alternatives despite the significant upside on display.\n\nAfter winging it with Carson Wentz and Max Brosmer as the backups, at the very least the Vikings realize they need better depth if they're going to run McCarthy back next season. McCarthy, for his part, sounded aware that his hold on the starting job is tenuous, too.\n\n\"There’s nothing promised. That’s something I take very seriously. It’s not something you buy and you get for the rest of your life. You rent it and you lease it every single day, and I’m just trying to make daily deposits and make sure I’m in this house for a long time.”\n\nFinishing with a five-game winning streak put the Vikings (9-8) a half-game behind Green Bay for the last spot even though they were eliminated before taking the field in Week 14.\n\nConsider this: If the Vikings just had better coverage on their kickoff after McCarthy's go-ahead touchdown pass in the final minute in Week 11, when Devin Duvernay's 56-yard return set Chicago up for the walk-off field goal, they would've won that game — and the NFC North title.\n\n“It’s going to sting not being in the tournament for not only our team and the work that they’ve put in, but our fan base and our ownership,” O'Connell said.\n\nThe Vikings still took third in the division on a tiebreaker over Detroit, meaning a road game next season against San Francisco (12-5) instead of Arizona (3-14) from the NFC West and home games against Indianapolis (8-9) instead of Tennessee (3-14) from the AFC South and Washington (5-12) instead of New York (4-13) from the NFC East.\n\nThe Vikings were able to get Justin Jefferson past the 1,000-yard mark for the sixth straight season to start his career, but the fact that he needed all 17 games to do that was ultimately one of many poor statistical reflections on this once-potent offense.\n\nThe Vikings were last in the NFL in turnovers, interceptions and third down conversions and second-to-last in sack percentage.\n\nThe Vikings had another stellar performance under the direction of defensive coordinator Brian Flores, finishing second in red zone touchdown rate and sack percentage and third in the league in yards allowed. They were seventh in points against, one of only two teams in the top 13 in the NFL to miss the playoffs, along with Kansas City.\n\nFlores will again be a candidate for head coach vacancies around the league, and his contract is expiring, too, raising the question about whether he will return. The scene at U.S. Bank Stadium on Sunday felt like a farewell to 14-year veteran safety Harrison Smith, too. Salary cap management will likely force the Vikings to move from one or both of the veteran defensive linemen they signed this season, Jonathan Allen and Javon Hargrave.\n\nThe quarterback search will be complicated by an unfavorable salary cap situation, with the Vikings carrying the second-highest projected overage in the league into the offseason and thus needing to shed multiple important players before they can add new ones. More depth is needed on the offensive line, too, with the future of center Ryan Kelly in doubt after multiple concussions.\n\nIn the draft, they have the 18th pick in the first round and still possess their original second and third-round selections. They currently own five third-day picks and are in line to be awarded mid-round compensatory selections for the departure of free agent quarterbacks Sam Darnold and Daniel Jones last year.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "The Houston Rockets expect to be without All-Star center Alperen Şengün for up to two weeks.\n\nŞengün went down with a right ankle injury very early in the team’s 110-104 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday. While he doesn’t have a specific timeline for his return — the team is planning to evaluate Şengün again in the coming days — head coach Ime Udoka confirmed Monday that Şengün will likely miss up to two weeks.\n\n“We’ll evaluate him at the end of the week,” Udoka said, via Sports Illustrated’s Lachard Binkley. “Need to get the swelling, the pain tolerance down and mobility, but you’re looking at a probably 10-14 days type thing.”\n\n[Get more Rockets news: Houston team feed]\n\nRoughly a minute into the game Saturday at the American Airlines Center, Şengün went up to try to fight for a defensive rebound against Mavericks center Daniel Gafford. As Şengün came down, his right ankle rolled hard. That sent him crashing to the court, where he remained until play stopped at the other end.\n\nThis is the play where Alperen Sengun got hurt, rolling his right ankle when landing on a rebound attempt. https://t.co/vEohvYuD61 pic.twitter.com/VVxGTjqmQh\n\n— ClutchFans (@clutchfans) January 4, 2026\n\nŞengün eventually limped off the court and was quickly ruled out of the game.\n\nHe is in the middle of a career season with the Rockets. The 23-year-old, who made his first All-Star Game last year, has put up a career-high 21.8 points this season while averaging 9 rebounds and 6.5 assists.\n\nWhile this will interrupt his dominant start to the season, and Şengün has a history of ankle injuries, the timeline this time seems relatively minor. If Şengün is out the full two weeks, he'd be back in time for the team’s matchup with the San Antonio Spurs on Jan. 20, meaning he would miss eight games.\n\nThe Rockets enter Monday night’s contest against the Phoenix Suns with a 21-11 record, which has them fifth in the Western Conference standings. Saturday’s loss to the Mavericks snapped a four-game winning streak.",

    "fullText": "The NFL playoff field is set, and it's missing half of the league's top 10 highest-paid quarterbacks in average annual value.\n\nSpotrac made note of that fact on Monday, a day after the dust settled on the NFL's regular season. Of the league's top 10 paid quarterbacks, Josh Allen, Trevor Lawrence, Jordan Love, Brock Purdy and Justin Herbert are all in the postseason.\n\nDak Prescott, Joe Burrow, Tua Tagovailoa, Jared Goff and Lamar Jackson are not.\n\nHalf of the Top 10 Average Paid QBs made the playoffs - half didn't.\n\nDak Prescott ❌\nJosh Allen ✅\nJoe Burrow ❌\nTrevor Lawrence ✅\nJordan Love ✅\nTua Tagovailoa ❌\nJared Goff ❌\nBrock Purdy ✅\nJustin Herbert ✅\nLamar Jackson ❌\n\n— Spotrac (@spotrac) January 5, 2026\n\nWhich got us to thinking. Are teams hamstringing their playoff chances in a salary-capped league by paying premiums for quarterbacks? Is it too difficult in the modern NFL to build a competitive roster around a quarterback playing on a premium salary?\n\nQuarterback is the most important position in football, if not in all of sports. It's difficult to win a Super Bowl without a high-end signal caller, though Super Bowls have been won with Nick Foles, Jeff Hostetler, Jim Plunkett, Brad Johnson and Trent Dilfer.\n\nBut having a Patrick Mahomes, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning or Joe Montana is historically the best ingredient for success. And they cost money.\n\nHere's a look at the salaries of starting quarterbacks for all 32 NFL teams, grouped by whether or not they made the playoffs. Players with a top-10 salary are in bold.\n\nCaleb Williams: $9.9 million (rookie contract)\n\nBryce Young: $9.5 million (rookie contract)\n\nDrake Maye: $9.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nC.J. Stroud: $9.1 million (rookie contract)\n\nBo Nix: $4.7 million (rookie contract)\n\nDak Prescott, Cowboys: $60 million\n\nJoe Burrow, Bengals: $55 million\n\nTua Tagovailoa, Dolphins: $53.1 million\n\nLamar Jackson, Ravens: $52 million\n\nKyler Murray, Cardinals: $46.1 million\n\nKirk Cousins, Falcons: $45 million\n\nPatrick Mahomes, Chiefs: $45 million\n\nGeno Smith, Raiders: $37.5 million\n\nBaker Mayfield, Buccaneers: $33.3 million\n\nJustin Fields, Jets: $20 million\n\nDaniel Jones, Colts: $14 million\n\nCam Ward, Titans: $12.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nJayden Daniels, Commanders: $9.4 million (rookie contract)\n\nJ.J. McCarthy, Vikings: $5.5 million (rookie contract)\n\nJaxson Dart, Giants: $4.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nTyler Shough, Saints: $2.7 million (rookie contract)\n\nShedeur Sanders, Browns: $1.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nIt's notable that five of the 12 playoff quarterbacks are playing on rookie contracts, which are capped by the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nThat cost control is extremely valuable, and optimizing roster construction around rookie quarterback contracts is a proven formula for success. Since the inception of the rookie wage scale in 2011, the Seattle Seahawks with Russell Wilson (2014 season) and the Kansas City Chiefs with Mahomes (2019 season) have navigated the rookie wage scale to Super Bowl victories.\n\nThis, season, the Patriots have an MVP candidate in Maye who's the ninth-highest paid player on the team. Nix playing on a $4.7 million salary has allowed the Broncos to build a Super Bowl contender despite Wilson's disastrous contract remaining on the books.\n\nStroud, meanwhile is a veteran quarterback in his third season who's surrounded by one of the NFL's fiercest defenses. It would not be a surprise to see any of them playing in or winning the Super Bowl in January.\n\nThis is an optimal way to build a Super contender in the short window available to pay quarterbacks on a rookie contract. This, of course, requires hitting successfully on a quarterback in the draft who can lead a team to contention at a young age.\n\nAnd it's also, obviously, not the only path to success. Thirteen of the 15 Super Bowls won since the inception of the rookie wage scale have been won by quarterbacks not playing on a rookie deal.\n\nAt some point, those rookie quarterbacks will be due for extensions. And if you've got a high-end quarterback on your hands who's due to be paid, there's little choice but to pay him. And that doesn't mean that you can't build a successful roster around said quarterback.\n\nYes, half of the top 10 paid quarterbacks will be watching the playoffs from home. But it's a little absurd to suggest that that's an indictment of paying top quarterbacks their market value.\n\nBurrow missed most of the season due to injury. Do the Bengals have also roster construction issues? Absolutely. But that's an issue that's plagued the franchise for pretty much the entirety of its existence under Brown family ownership, with or without a premium quarterback on the roster.\n\nThe Cowboys likewise have roster concerns that limited their upside. Like with the Bengals, it's fairer to take a look at the decades-long management under Jerry Jones (and the defense specifically this year) than point to the $60 million salary of Prescott, who was excellent this season, to explain why the Cowboys aren't in the playoffs.\n\nIt's difficult to argue that the Lions and Ravens didn't build strong rosters around Goff and Jackson. There's talent on both sides of the ball on both teams outside of their quarterbacks. And Jackson was clearly limited by injuries this season, while the Lions were ravaged by injuries of their own.\n\nIn the end, 14 of the league's 32 teams make the playoffs. The Ravens and Lions just missed out, but it wouldn't be a surprise for either or both to return to contention next season.\n\nAnd then there's Tagovailoa. His contract at this point was pretty clearly a mistake. He got benched at the end of the season, and his time in Miami very well may be done. The Dolphins would surely take a do-over on his deal of they could.\n\nBut the Prescott, Jackson, Burrow and Goff deals? There are surely no regrets from their respective franchises. Teams without high-end quarterbacks would certainly jump at the chance to take their contracts on.",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich’s reported long-standing interest in Crystal Palace defender Marc Guéhi could hit a snag: another top European club could beat it to the punch this month.\n\nThe German Rekordmeister had been tipped for contract talks with the English international, who is now in the final six months of his current deal and free to negotiate with other clubs as a free agent. However, a run of injuries to Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City defense has created the possibility of an immediate transfer, according to reporting in the BBC.\n\nManchester City are exploring a move for Marc Guéhi this month, in the wake of defenders Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias suffering injuries. Bayern, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Inter and Atlético are among the European clubs to have shown an interest in signing Guéhi on a free transfer. Liverpool remain heavily interested. It is understood Crystal Palace would consider selling Guéhi this month to avoid the scenario of losing their captain for nothing come the end of the season. Market regulations mean he can sign a pre-agreement with an overseas club from this month [@SamiMokbel_BBC, @BBCSport]\n\nMan City has dropped points again this weekend, this time to Chelsea, and is seeing its campaign to keep the pressure on Arsenal falter. The Gunners sit six points atop the league after 20 matchdays. Guéhi surely would not come cheap, but the incentives are aligning for all parties involved — and Bayern is in no position at the moment to throw in a bid. If Pep wants Guéhi, it is hard to see this not happening.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

Now, after destabilising the Blues, United could land their ex-manager in one fell swoop.\n\nIt looked a certainty that the ex-Leicester City boss was heading back to Manchester City to replace Guardiola ahead of next summer, but United could offer an immediate job opportunity.\n\nFeature image Clive Mason via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Carlie Irsay-Gordon liked what she saw during her first 10 games as the Indianapolis Colts' co-owner.\n\nQuarterback Daniel Jones and running back Jonathan Taylor played at MVP levels, coach Shane Steichen's offense operated at a historically efficient clip and general manager Chris Ballard pulled the trigger on a midseason trade to fill the team's most glaring need.\n\nThen Jones tried to play through a fractured lower left leg, suffered a torn right Achilles tendon and the season unraveled quickly as a season-ending seven-game losing streak knocked Indy (8-9) out of the playoffs again.\n\nYet in her most significant move since taking over the franchise's day-to-day operations from her late father, Jim, Irsay-Gordon ignored the urge — and the calls from some fans — to fire Ballard and Steichen and instead decided to give them another chance to replicate their early season success.\n\n“We have been very clear with Chris and Shane that giving them another opportunity means that the sense of urgency for them to deliver and perform has never been higher,” Irsay-Gordon said. “Chris and Shane are both capable of facing this challenge head on and finding a way to achieve the results our fans deserve, which is winning games, getting to the postseason and ultimately winning championships.”\n\nIt might have been easier for Irsay-Gordon to explain if she moved on from Ballard, who has two playoff appearances and one postseason win in his nine-year tenure, or Steichen, who's 25-26 in three seasons and has never made it to the playoffs. Or perhaps both following the historic second-half collapse.\n\nIndy became the first team since the 1995 Oakland Raiders and just the sixth since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger to start 8-2 and not make the postseason.\n\nIrsay-Gordon blames injuries for the second-half failures.\n\nIn addition to Jones, the Colts lost two-time All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner for most of the final five games because of a strained calf, 2023 All-Pro cornerback Charvarius Ward for most of the second half because of two concussions and three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle DeForest Buckner for six of the final seven games because of a neck injury. The result: Indy's skid included four losses by six or fewer points.\n\nAnd for that reason, Irsay-Gordon didn't see the need to start over in 2026. She said she made that decision last week.\n\n“What we saw in that first half, we were on a record pace, dominating offensively,” she said. “I think we just have to be able to face adversity better, and I believe in the team. I believe in the team and hope to stay healthier next season.”\n\nBallard again finds himself entering an offseason dealing with questions about the sport's most important position.\n\nBefore the injury, Jones was expected to cash in on a comeback season with a big-dollar contract. Instead, he'll enter free agency for a second straight season dealing with questions about his injury history and how quickly he'll return to the field — likely decreasing his price tag.\n\n“I'd love to be back here,” Jones said. “I think it's a great organization and I've enjoyed being here. Obviously, there's a business side to it and I understand that, but I've really enjoyed being around these people.”\n\nSteichen and Ballard also must decide what to do with the oft-injured Anthony Richardson, the No. 4 pick in the 2023 draft, who lost the starting job in training camp and wasn't even active after mid-October after fracturing the orbital bone near his eye in a bizarre pregame accident.\n\nIn his first two seasons, receiver Alec Pierce struggled to make a consistent impact. The last two years, he has produced the highest per-catch average among the league's qualifiers.\n\nNow the soon-to-be free agency is likely to cash in. Pierce had 47 catches, his first 1,000-yard season (1,003) for a 21.3-yard average with six TDs this season while establishing himself as a favorite for three starting quarterbacks — Jones, 44-year-old Philip Rivers and rookie Riley Leonard.\n\n“I guess it's more like being recruited because you actually have a say in it now,” Pierce said. “It's ultimately my decision.”\n\nWard had three concussions in his first season with Indy, and the second — suffered in a pregame collision with tight end Drew Ogletree — prompted Ward to contemplate retirement.\n\nHe might be going through that process again after finishing the season on injured reserve with his third concussion.\n\n“I've got to talk to my family,” Ward said. “If I walk away, I feel like I'd be happy. I'd have won a Super Bowl, made a whole lot of money, made the Pro Bowl, made All-Pro. I did everything I wanted to. So I feel like if I walk away, I won't regret it. I'm good.\"\n\nIrsay-Gordon made it clear the sense of urgency next year is even higher next season and her comment is likely to resonate throughout the offseason as Ballard contemplates future moves. Steichen said he'll contemplate what went wrong late in games, late in the season and how he can get the Colts back to the postseason.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

Tagovailoa's 1,660 passing yards were his fewest since 2021 and his 15 interceptions were a career high.\n\nEwers will be part of the competition for the job in 2026. It remains to be seen whether Tagovailoa will be, though it seems likely the Dolphins will part ways.\n\nHe is owed $54 million guaranteed in 2026. The Dolphins could release him with a post-June 1 designation at the start of the new league year to split his $99.2 million cap charge over two years.\n\n\"In 2026, I think there will be competition for our starting quarterback,\" McDaniel said. \"What that is and how it looks, that remains to be seen.

    "fullText": "Patriots quarterback Drake Maye had an impressive regular season and is in the running for MVP, which left former New England wide receiver Julian Edelman naming his favorite thing about Maye’s game.\n\n“His attitude,” Edelman said Monday on “The Herd”. “Just talking to people over there, everyone just talks about how he is so hungry to be coached and to learn, and it translates to how he is playing. He looks so confident. He makes it look so easy.”\n\nMaye is just in his second season in the NFL, but he plays like a seasoned veteran every week. Although he is still young and lacks postseason experience, the Patriots shouldn’t be counted out in the playoffs.\n\nThe AFC is lacking a lot of veteran quarterbacks in this postseason, with Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow sitting at home. Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen could be the quarterback to beat in the AFC. However, Maye already beat him once this season and should’ve beaten him again.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Maye performs in the postseason. If he plays as he did throughout the season, there’s a strong chance that New England could be on its way to the Super Bowl.\n\nDrake Maye Makes His Case For Why He Deserves To Be NFL MVP",

    "description": "A peculiar stat could unlock an Andrew Mangiapane trade for the Oilers. Other teams might see his struggles as opportunity.",
    "fullText": "Trade speculation around Andrew Mangiapane is heating up, and Elliotte Friedman believes it’s only a matter of time before the Edmonton Oilers move the winger. While the fit in Edmonton hasn’t worked as hoped, Friedman suggests a deal is very doable based on analytics, contract value, and league-wide interest.\n\nSpeaking on 32 Thoughts, Friedman noted Mangiapane’s poor PDO — often viewed as a “luck” stat — could actually help the Oilers. Friedman wonders whether another team might see Mangiapane’s struggles as more circumstantial than skill-related, suggesting that another organization could view him as a bounce-back candidate. With one year remaining at $3.6 million, Friedman doesn’t expect Edmonton to have much trouble finding a trade partner.\n\nTo date, the Ducks have been linked, but new names recently popped up on Monday, suggesting the Detroit Red Wings and Winnipeg Jets might also be a fit.\n\nFriedman compared Mangiapane’s situation to Mason Marchment, a player who struggled in one stop before thriving elsewhere. Sometimes players need a change of scenery, and Mangiapane has a proven scoring history that remains valuable.\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks have surfaced as a possible landing spot, largely due to their cap flexibility and recent struggles. Friedman believes Anaheim may look to add or retain veterans, especially with Frank Vatrano sidelined long-term, to help stabilize a young roster.\n\nWith that in mind, Friedman poured cold water on rumors involving Ryan Strome coming back to Edmonton. Strome earns roughly $1.5 million more than Mangiapane, and the Oilers don’t have the cap space to make that work. More importantly, Strome isn’t the type of bottom-six, role-accepting player Edmonton is targeting.\n\nInstead, the Oilers are reportedly seeking a grinder-type forward willing to play limited minutes and embrace a depth role — something Mangiapane has been trending toward but seems less-than-thrilled about doing. It's reportedly why he's open to a trade in the first place -- to go where there is more opportunity to play a more prominent role.\n\nToronto has also been loosely connected due to Brad Treliving’s history with Mangiapane, but Friedman doesn’t see that as a realistic option.\n\nBottom line: Edmonton will find a landing spot for Mangiapane. The only question is where and when.\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Edmonton Oilers team site to never miss the latest news, game-day coverage, and more.   Add us to your Google News favourites, and never miss a story.",

    "fullText": "Former Baylor redshirt sophomore defensive tackle DK Kalu has committed to the Florida Gators.\n\nKalu announced his decision on Monday, Jan. 5, joining former teammate DJ Coleman in moving from Baylor to Florida. A consensus three-star prospect out of high school, Kalu redshirted in 2023 after not seeing any action as a true freshman. He played three games as a reserve defensive lineman in 2024, making one start and recording one solo tackle.\n\nIn 2025, Kalu played 281 total snaps, earning a 59.7 offensive grade, a 61.5 run-defense grade, a 68.4 tackling grade (49th among Big 12 defensive linemen) and a 54.0 pass-rushing grade from Pro Football Focus. He played in nine games, starting six, recording 11 total tackles (four solo) and 0.5 tackles for a loss.\n\n247Sports ranks Kalu No. 705 overall and No. 48 among defensive linemen in the 2026 transfer cycle. On3 has him at No. 684 and No. 75, respectively.\n\nHe was on campus this weekend for an official visit.\n\nCommitted 🐊 pic.twitter.com/WU9S8wrBkV\n\n— DK Kalu🇳🇬🤴🏿 (@dk_kalu) January 5, 2026\n\nFollowing transfer portal losses, including starter Michai Boireau, the Gators have five defensive linemen in 2026. Redshirt senior Jamari Lyons has starting potential, as does redshirt junior Brendan Bett. Kalu is a depth addition, but he will compete for a starting job. Florida also returns Joseph Mbatchou and Jeramiah McCloud, and freshman Kendall Guervil recently signed as well.\n\nThe dilemma is that Boireau primarily played nose tackle for Florida last year, which none of the names mentioned above have much experience at. Lyons could step into that role, opening the door for Bett and Kalu to rotate alongside him. Florida could also add another defensive lineman from the transfer portal.\n\nAt 6-foot-4-inches, 309 pounds, Kalu provides size and depth to the position room.\n\nKalu is the fourth official transfer portal addition of the 2026 cycle for Florida, following Baylor safety DJ Coleman, James Madison tight end Lacota Dippre and Georgia Tech wide receiver Bailey Stockton.\n\nFlorida is also expected to land Georgia Tech quarterback Aaron Philo and interior offensive lineman Harrison Moore.\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida Gators football earns commitment from Baylor DT DK Kalu",

Harrison posted on his social media X account about the offer from the Spartans following his visit to Michigan State this past weekend.\n\nHarrision racked up 38 catches for 652 yards and five touchdowns during his freshman season with the Buccaneers. He will have three years of eligibility remaining.\n\nHarrison is rated as a three-star prospect by 247Sports, and ranked as the No. 43 wide receiver in the portal class. He is also listed as the No. 175 overall prospect in the portal by 247Sports.\n\nIt appears this transfer portal recruiting battle is down to Michigan State and Ole Miss at this time. He has visited both the Spartans and Rebels, and also holds offers from both. There certainly could be some other teams that enter the mix, but at the moment those are the two reportedly showing the most interest in Harrison.\n\nBlessed to receive an offer from @MSU_Football @iKingGreen pic.twitter.com/I6Z1FquMf7\n\n— Jeremiah (SCAR) Harrison (@cfwscar) January 5, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

    "fullText": "Well, there'll be at least one Carolina Panthers legend in the building for Saturday's wild-card matchup against the Los Angeles Rams. The thing is, he'll be on the job.\n\nAs revealed on Monday, franchise great Greg Olsen will be on FOX's broadcast team for this weekend's playoff game from Bank of America Stadium. Olsen, as usual, will be joined by play-by-by commentator Joe Davis and sideline reporter Pam Oliver.\n\nBefore becoming an Emmy Award-winning color analyst, Olsen played nine of his 14 NFL seasons with the Panthers. The former three-time Pro Bowl tight end finished up as the Carolina's third all-time leading pass catcher, amassing 6,463 receiving yards between 2011 and 2019.\n\nOlsen, perhaps fittingly, was a part of the Panthers' last playoff team—back in 2017. That trip ended in a wild-card round loss to the New Orleans Saints, where Olsen reeled in eight catches for 107 yards and a touchdown.\n\nThis will mark Olsen's fourth time covering the Panthers this season, with his last assignment coming in the team's Week 9 victory over the Green Bay Packers.\n\nFollow @ThePanthersWire on Twitter/X for more Panthers content.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Panthers Wire: Announcers for Panthers' wild-card game vs. Rams are revealed",

    "fullText": "Transfer Portal season may be in full swing, but high school football recruiting won’t be slowing down this winter, either.\n\nAttention has nearly turned in full to the 2027 cycle. All-American games will round out this month and then it’ll be on to camp season. Visits will be taken and early commitments will be made. Looking at the top EDGE prospects in the cycle, many are already off the board.\n\nAs of Jan. 5, eight of the 32 blue-chip EDGE recruits in the 2027 cycle are committed. That includes the No. 2 prospect at the position in five-star David Jacobs, who made a last-second pivot to Ohio State on Dec. 29. Below is a look at the top committed EDGEs early on in the cycle.\n\nSchool: Blessed Trinity Catholic (Ga.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 10 NATL. (No. 2 EDGE)\n\nOn his commitment: “I love everything about Ohio State,” Jacobs told Rivals’ Chad Simmons. “I was there for the Rutgers game and that visit really blew me away. The coaches, the players, and the atmosphere made a big impact on me. I knew about Ohio State and had been following them for a long time, but that visit showed me a lot.”\n\nSchool: Irmo (S.C.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 34 NATL. (No. 5 EDGE)\n\nOn his commitment: “Coach (Sterling) Lucas is a coach I trust and believe in,” Bryant told Simmons. “South Carolina wasn’t one of my first offers, but he was recruiting me before that. He started recruiting me early, and he’s like family. He’s easy to talk to, we have a nice relationship, and he’s always been a coach I knew I would love to play for … LSU has a storied history. They’ve always developed players, and it’s a good school with a lot of success.”\n\nSchool: Vigor (Ala.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 88 NATL. (No. 10 EDGE)\n\nOn his commitment: “I’m still open with my options,” Garror told Rivals’ Adam Gorney in November. “Just waiting it out and talking with everyone that I can.”\n\nVia Gorney: “There are three main contenders working to flip the Mobile Vigor standout with Auburn, Florida State and Texas A&M being the biggest threats to Alabama in his recruitment.”\n\nSchool: Cy Falls (Texas)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 115 NATL. (No. 17 EDGE)\n\nOn his commitment: “After the first and second visits, I got to really talk to Coach Elko and the whole staff and they really expressed how much they wanted me,” McCarty told Rivals’ Sam Spiegelman. “Coach (Jay) Bateman, Coach (Sean) Spencer and Coach Tony (Jerod-Eddie) all played roles. They just pushed the hardest and they know that I’m a family person — and they got the closest with my family.”\n\nSchool: Wayzata (Minn.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 119 NATL. (No. 18 EDGE)\n\nScout’s Take: “Eli Diane is one that we really ranked high in our initial rankings and we continue to like what we see from the Minnesota commit. A lot of the tools we like to see from prospects at his position, we could see where he could continue to grow and become a defensive lineman long-term. A ton of developmental upside there, we like the film and feel like he’s just scratching the surface on his potential.”\n\nSchool: Muskegon (Mich.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 126 NATL. (No. 19 EDGE)\n\nOn Michigan: “We went to a lot of colleges and, when we got there, it was different,” Kitchen told The Wolverine’s Ethan McDowell in September. “Everybody was huge. They were really hitting out there, really putting in work and it was just different.”\n\nSchool: Ridgeline (Utah)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 135 NATL. (No. 20 EDGE)\n\nOn his commitment: “It was in the back of my head for the last month-and-a-half with the communication they’ve had and just seeing their defense and how crazy it is these past few years,” Jones told Rivals’ Adam Gorney. “Looking back on the coaches and how they develop kids and how I could trust myself in their hands to get me to where I want to be.”\n\nSchool: Grimsley (N.C.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 282 NATL. (No. 28 EDGE)\n\nRogers on new VT head coach James Franklin: “It changes some things for me,” he told Rivals. “I’m sure they will reach back out and Blacksburg is still my first love. I would love it make it work again with them if possible … “It’s definitely a great hire. I’ve heard nothing but great things about him.”",

    "description": "Mike McDaniel's job as head coach of the Miami Dolphins appears to be safe for now.  “Listen, I was hired here to not just be the head coach,” McDaniel said Monday, a day after the Dolphins were blown out at New England to finish the season 7-10.  “I was hired to return a storied franchise to winning regular-season games, playoff games and Super Bowls.”",
    "fullText": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Mike McDaniel's job as head coach of the Miami Dolphins appears to be safe for now. He knows that will only remain true if he produces the results he was hired for in 2022.\n\n“Listen, I was hired here to not just be the head coach,” McDaniel said Monday, a day after the Dolphins were blown out at New England to finish the season 7-10. “I was hired to return a storied franchise to winning regular-season games, playoff games and Super Bowls.”\n\nThe latter two have not happened. And after another season of failed expectations in which the Dolphins missed the playoffs for the second straight year, they enter another offseason of uncertainty, starting with who'll be their next general manager and starting quarterback in 2026.\n\nMcDaniel, who is 35-32 in four seasons as Miami's coach, indicated Monday that he will be part of the decision-making in both processes. Though he did not specifically say he has been told by Dolphins ownership that he's returning next season — nor has the team made an official announcement — McDaniel said he has spoken with owner Stephen Ross.\n\n“I know one thing, every day that I'm employed by the Miami Dolphins as the head coach, I'm solely focused on doing what I was hired here to do,” McDaniel said. \"Eventually, like everybody else in this league, you're not entitled to this position. If I'm not able to win regular-season games, playoff games and Super Bowls, eventually the job won't be mine.\n\n\"And I think that is the nature of the NFL, and shame on you if you expect anything else.”\n\nThe Dolphins parted ways with longtime general manager Chris Grier on Oct. 31 following a loss to the Baltimore Ravens that dropped them to 2-7. Dolphins senior personnel executive Champ Kelly has been Miami's interim GM since, and the team recently brought in Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman to aid in its GM search.\n\n“I'm going to be a part of the (interview) process,” McDaniel said, “and beyond that, I think the main objective and what everyone's counting on is that we have a cohesive crew of people that are working in the same direction. I'm happy to support all of that. It's not my decision to make, nor do I think that would be an intelligent way to go about business.”\n\nBeyond front office decisions, the Dolphins will need to figure out what they're going to do at quarterback after Tua Tagovailoa was benched for the final three games of the season because of poor play.\n\nMcDaniel said Monday there will be a quarterback competition to determine Miami's 2026 starter, and he will meet with Tagovailoa on Tuesday morning to discuss the season.\n\nTagovailoa threw for 2,660 yards with 20 touchdowns but showed a stark decline in accuracy and mobility, just one season after signing a four-year, $212.4 million extension in July 2024. He finished second in the NFL with 15 interceptions, which was a career high.\n\nTagovailoa is guaranteed $54 million for 2026, and the Dolphins would incur significant hits to the salary cap by releasing him. Releasing him next year would result in a $99 million dead cap charge. If the move is designated as a post-June 1 release, those charges are split over two years, with $67.4 million allocated to the 2026 cap and $31.8 million in 2027.\n\nRookie seventh-round pick Quinn Ewers went 1-2 as Miami's starter but didn't separate himself as the clear No. 1 option for 2026, throwing for 569 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions. And the Dolphins recently signed rookie sixth-round pick Cam Miller off the Raiders' practice squad to join the competition.\n\nDespite a second consecutive losing season that ensured the Dolphins' 25-year playoff win drought will remain intact, McDaniel apparently has the backing of Ross. And the two will meet again later this week to discuss the organization's future.\n\n“We both share the same sentiment that we’re not where we want to be,” McDaniel said. \"We’re not just dismissing this season as, ‘Oops, we’ll try again.’”\n\nThe Dolphins will also need to figure out what to do with the contract of star receiver Tyreek Hill, who'll be 32 in March and suffered a severe knee injury in September.\n\nThe Dolphins acquired Hill in a trade with Kansas City in 2022 and gave him a $120 million, four-year contract extension, which he restructured in 2024 and runs through 2026.\n\nHill is owed about $29.9 million next season, though $11 million of that becomes guaranteed after the start of the new league year, which is also when the Dolphins will have to pay him a $5 million roster bonus.\n\nHill would carry a $51.9 million cap hit if the Dolphins release him.\n\nMcDaniel doesn't believe the organization is heading toward a complete rebuild. Regardless, the new GM will have several core pieces to build around, including third-year running back De'Von Achane, second-year left tackle Patrick Paul, veteran center Aaron Brewer and veteran linebacker Jordyn Brooks.\n\nAchane had one of the best seasons of any Dolphins running back, and Brooks, who said Monday he hopes to remain in Miami the rest of his career, led the NFL with 183 tackles.\n\nA couple players set to hit free agency have expressed interest in returning to to the Dolphins, including veteran tight end Darren Waller.\n\nWaller came out of retirement to play in Miami on a one-year deal last July but was limited to nine games because of injuries. Still, Waller caught 24 of 34 targets for six touchdowns. The 33-year-old said he's undecided on whether he will return to football next season, but said he will make a decision soon and is considering returning to Miami.\n\nOnce the new GM is in place, the Dolphins will likely need to get an earlier start on free agency than they did last season. They also have the 11th pick in the NFL draft.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "Monday’s NBA and NHL slates present plenty of betting opportunities as teams hit midseason form and trends across both leagues turn into dependable indicators. As January rolls on, separation on the hardwood and ice sharpens betting lines, creating clearer opportunities at the window.  Here are tonight’s best bets brought to you by BetOnline.ag. All new players get a 50% welcome bonus and up to $250 in free bets.\n\nRundown: The Los Angeles Kings (17-14-9) wrap up a two-game home set against the Minnesota Wild (25-10-8) on Monday night at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nLos Angeles enters tonight’s contest riding the momentum of a 5-4 shootout win over Minnesota on Saturday, a result that stood out given the Kings’ season-long offensive struggles. Ranked 31st in goals per game, Los Angeles capitalized on its chances against a Wild team that had won eight of its previous 10 contests, with Adrian Kempe recording a two-point night to spark the breakthrough performance. While the final score reflected a wide-open game, much of the damage came from situational lapses rather than sustained offensive pressure.\n\nDespite Saturday’s nine-goal outburst, both teams continue to lean on structure and goal prevention as their foundation. The Kings rank third in the NHL in goals allowed per game (2.65), relying on disciplined defensive-zone coverage and limiting high-danger chances, a style that has pushed 22 of their 40 games (55%) below the posted total. Minnesota enters with a similar identity, excelling at controlling tempo and suppressing second-chance opportunities.\n\nExpect a sharper, more methodical approach in the rematch, with both teams tightening neutral-zone play and limiting rush chances. With goaltending and defensive structure likely to dictate the pace, this matchup sets up for a lower-scoring outcome this time around.\n\nRundown: The Los Angeles Clippers (12-22) close out a five-game homestand on Monday night as they host the Golden State Warriors (19-17) at Intuit Dome.\n\nLos Angeles looks to rebound after a 31-point blowout loss to Boston that snapped its six-game winning streak and dropped the Clippers back to 10 games under the .500 mark. Jaylen Brown’s 50-point outburst exposed some of Los Angeles’ season-long offensive issues, as the Clippers continue to rank near the bottom of the league in scoring efficiency. Despite the uneven record, Los Angeles’ recent surge has translated to the betting market, covering seven of its last 10 games and posting an 8–8 record against the spread when listed as underdogs of 2.5 points or more. Kawhi Leonard and James Harden will be tasked with generating efficient looks against a Golden State defense that ranks seventh in the NBA in points allowed (113.9 per game) and does a strong job limiting perimeter scoring.\n\nOn the other side, Golden State enters playing its best basketball in weeks, winning six of its last eight contests behind the continued brilliance of Stephen Curry. At 37 years old, Curry remains the engine of the Warriors’ offense, averaging 28.8 points per game, ninth-highest in the league. While Golden State’s recent success has boosted its position in the standings, it has not consistently carried over to the betting window, as the Warriors have covered just three of their last 10 games and sit 15-21 ATS on the season. As favorites of 2.5 points or more, Golden State has struggled to separate, owning a 9-14-1 ATS record in those spots.\n\nExpect Los Angeles to lean on home-court energy and create opportunities in key spots, keeping this matchup within a single possession as the final buzzer sounds.",

    "description": "NVIDIA today kickstarted the next generation of AI with the launch of the NVIDIA Rubin platform, comprising six new chips designed to deliver one incredible AI supercomputer.",
    "fullText": "CES—NVIDIA today kickstarted the next generation of AI with the launch of the NVIDIA Rubin platform, comprising six new chips designed to deliver one incredible AI supercomputer. NVIDIA Rubin sets a new standard for building, deploying and securing the world’s largest and most advanced AI systems at the lowest cost to accelerate mainstream AI adoption.\n\nThe Rubin platform uses extreme codesign across the six chips — the NVIDIA Vera CPU, NVIDIA Rubin GPU, NVIDIA NVLink™ 6 Switch, NVIDIA ConnectX®-9 SuperNIC, NVIDIA BlueField®-4 DPU and NVIDIA Spectrum™-6 Ethernet Switch — to slash training time and inference token costs.\n\n“Rubin arrives at exactly the right moment, as AI computing demand for both training and inference is going through the roof,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With our annual cadence of delivering a new generation of AI supercomputers — and extreme codesign across six new chips — Rubin takes a giant leap toward the next frontier of AI.”\n\nNamed for Vera Florence Cooper Rubin — the trailblazing American astronomer whose discoveries transformed humanity’s understanding of the universe — the Rubin platform features the NVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL72 rack-scale solution and the NVIDIA HGX Rubin NVL8 system.\n\nThe Rubin platform introduces five innovations, including the latest generations of NVIDIA NVLink interconnect technology, Transformer Engine, Confidential Computing and RAS Engine, as well as the NVIDIA Vera CPU. These breakthroughs will accelerate agentic AI, advanced reasoning and massive-scale mixture-of-experts (MoE) model inference at up to 10x lower cost per token of the NVIDIA Blackwell platform. Compared with its predecessor, the NVIDIA Rubin platform trains MoE models with 4x fewer GPUs to accelerate AI adoption.\n\nBroad Ecosystem Support\n\nAmong the world’s leading AI labs, cloud service providers, computer makers and startups expected to adopt Rubin are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Anthropic, Black Forest Labs, Cisco, Cohere, CoreWeave, Cursor, Dell Technologies, Google, Harvey, HPE, Lambda, Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, Nebius, Nscale, OpenAI, OpenEvidence, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), Perplexity, Runway, Supermicro, Thinking Machines Lab and xAI.\n\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI: “Intelligence scales with compute. When we add more compute, models get more capable, solve harder problems and make a bigger impact for people. The NVIDIA Rubin platform helps us keep scaling this progress so advanced intelligence benefits everyone.”\n\nDario Amodei, cofounder and CEO of Anthropic: “The efficiency gains in the NVIDIA Rubin platform represent the kind of infrastructure progress that enables longer memory, better reasoning and more reliable outputs. Our collaboration with NVIDIA helps power our safety research and our frontier models.”\n\nMark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Meta: “NVIDIA’s Rubin platform promises to deliver the step-change in performance and efficiency required to deploy the most advanced models to billions of people.”\n\nElon Musk, founder and CEO of xAI: “💚🎉🚀 🤖NVIDIA Rubin will be a rocket engine for AI. If you want to train and deploy frontier models at scale, this is the infrastructure you use — and Rubin will remind the world that NVIDIA is the gold standard.💚🎉🚀 🤖”\n\nSatya Nadella, executive chairman and CEO of Microsoft: “We are building the world’s most powerful AI superfactories to serve any workload, anywhere, with maximum performance and efficiency. With the addition of NVIDIA Vera Rubin GPUs, we will empower developers and organizations to create, reason and scale in entirely new ways.”\n\nMike Intrator, cofounder and CEO of CoreWeave: “We built CoreWeave to help pioneers accelerate their innovations with the unmatched performance of our purpose-built AI platform, matching the right technology to the right workloads as they evolve. The NVIDIA Rubin platform represents an important advancement for reasoning, agentic and large-scale inference workloads, and we’re excited to add it to our platform. With CoreWeave Mission Control as the operating standard, we can integrate new capabilities quickly and run them reliably at production scale, working in close partnership with NVIDIA.”\n\nMatt Garman, CEO of AWS: “AWS and NVIDIA have been driving cloud AI innovation together for more than 15 years. The NVIDIA Rubin platform on AWS represents our continued commitment to delivering cutting-edge AI infrastructure that gives customers unmatched choice and flexibility.

Multistep problem-solving requires models to process, reason and act across long sequences of tokens. Designed to serve the demands of complex AI workloads, the Rubin platform’s five groundbreaking technologies include:\n\nAI-Native Storage and Secure, Software-Defined Infrastructure\n\nNVIDIA Rubin introduces NVIDIA Inference Context Memory Storage Platform, a new class of AI-native storage infrastructure designed to scale inference context at gigascale.\n\nAs AI factories increasingly adopt bare-metal and multi-tenant deployment models, maintaining strong infrastructure control and isolation becomes essential.\n\nBlueField-4 also introduces Advanced Secure Trusted Resource Architecture, or ASTRA, a system-level trust architecture that gives AI infrastructure builders a single, trusted control point to securely provision, isolate and operate large-scale AI environments without compromising performance.\n\nWith AI applications evolving toward multi-turn agentic reasoning, AI-native organizations must manage and share far larger volumes of inference context across users, sessions and services.\n\nDifferent Forms for Different Workloads\n\nNVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL72 offers a unified, secure system that combines 72 NVIDIA Rubin GPUs, 36 NVIDIA Vera CPUs, NVIDIA NVLink 6, NVIDIA ConnectX-9 SuperNICs and NVIDIA BlueField-4 DPUs.\n\nNVIDIA will also offer the NVIDIA HGX Rubin NVL8 platform, a server board that links eight Rubin GPUs through NVLink to support x86-based generative AI platforms. The HGX Rubin NVL8 platform accelerates training, inference and scientific computing for AI and high-performance computing workloads.\n\nNVIDIA DGX SuperPOD™ serves as a reference for deploying Rubin-based systems at scale, integrating either NVIDIA DGX Vera Rubin NVL72 or DGX Rubin NVL8 systems with NVIDIA BlueField-4 DPUs, NVIDIA ConnectX-9 SuperNICs, NVIDIA InfiniBand networking and NVIDIA Mission Control™ software.\n\nNext-Generation Ethernet Networking\n\nAdvanced Ethernet networking and storage are components of AI infrastructure critical to keeping data centers running at full speed, improving performance and efficiency, and lowering costs.\n\nNVIDIA Spectrum-6 Ethernet is the next generation of Ethernet for AI networking, built to scale Rubin-based AI factories with higher efficiency and greater resilience, and enabled by 200G SerDes communication circuitry, co-packaged optics and AI-optimized fabrics.\n\nBuilt on the Spectrum-6 architecture, Spectrum-X Ethernet Photonics co-packaged optical switch systems deliver 10x greater reliability and 5x longer uptime for AI applications while achieving 5x better power efficiency, maximizing performance per watt compared with traditional methods. Spectrum-XGS Ethernet technology, part of the Spectrum-X Ethernet platform, enables facilities separated by hundreds of kilometers and more to function as a single AI environment.\n\nTogether, these innovations define the next generation of the NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet platform, engineered with extreme codesign for Rubin to enable massive-scale AI factories and pave the way for future million-GPU environments.\n\nRubin Readiness\n\nNVIDIA Rubin is in full production, and Rubin-based products will be available from partners the second half of 2026.\n\nAmong the first cloud providers to deploy Vera Rubin-based instances in 2026 will be AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft and OCI, as well as NVIDIA Cloud Partners CoreWeave, Lambda, Nebius and Nscale.\n\nMicrosoft will deploy NVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL72 rack-scale systems as part of next-generation AI data centers, including future Fairwater AI superfactory sites.\n\nDesigned to deliver unprecedented efficiency and performance for training and inference workloads, the Rubin platform will provide the foundation for Microsoft’s next-generation cloud AI capabilities. Microsoft Azure will offer a tightly optimized platform enabling customers to accelerate innovation across enterprise, research and consumer applications.\n\nCoreWeave will integrate NVIDIA Rubin-based systems into its AI cloud platform beginning in the second half of 2026. CoreWeave is built to operate multiple architectures side by side, enabling customers to bring Rubin into their environments, where it will deliver the greatest impact across training, inference and agentic workloads.\n\nTogether with NVIDIA, CoreWeave will help AI pioneers take advantage of Rubin’s advancements in reasoning and MoE models, while continuing to deliver the performance, operational reliability and scale required for production AI across the full lifecycle with CoreWeave Mission Control.\n\nIn addition, Cisco, Dell, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro are expected to deliver a wide range of servers based on Rubin products.\n\nAI labs including Anthropic, Black Forest, Cohere, Cursor, Harvey, Meta, Mistral AI, OpenAI, OpenEvidence, Perplexity, Runway, Thinking Machines Lab and xAI are looking to the NVIDIA Rubin platform to train larger, more capable models and to serve long-context, multimodal systems at lower latency and cost than with prior GPU generations.\n\nInfrastructure software and storage partners AIC, Canonical, Cloudian, DDN, Dell, HPE, Hitachi Vantara, IBM, NetApp, Nutanix, Pure Storage, Supermicro, SUSE, VAST Data and WEKA are working with NVIDIA to design next-generation platforms for Rubin infrastructure.\n\nThe Rubin platform marks NVIDIA’s third-generation rack-scale architecture, with more than 80 NVIDIA MGX™ ecosystem partners.\n\nTo unlock this density, Red Hat today announced an expanded collaboration with NVIDIA to deliver a complete AI stack optimized for the NVIDIA Rubin platform with Red Hat’s hybrid cloud portfolio, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat AI.

    "description": "Many are celebrating the ouster of a brutal dictator, but the Maduro regime may survive the loss of Maduro.",
    "fullText": "On my last visit to Venezuela in 2019, I saw children starving because of the kleptocracy overseen by President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nIn the impoverished, violent slum of La Dolorita in Caracas, I met an emaciated 5-year-old girl, Alaska. Her mother told me that Alaska, weighing just 26 pounds and near death from malnutrition, had been turned away from four hospitals because no beds were available.\n\nAnother mother wept as she said that her 8-month-old baby girl, Daisha, died after three hospitals had turned the girl away.\n\nMany Americans don’t understand how brutal and incompetent Maduro’s dictatorship was, and how much suffering the population endured. Government thugs tortured, raped and killed with impunity, and ordinary citizens lost their children to tragic misrule — even as regime officials lived lavishly and ostentatiously (such as overindulging in expensive whiskeys at the hotel where I last stayed).\n\nVenezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world, and back in 2000 it had a lower child mortality rate than Peru, Brazil and Colombia; now, the rate is higher in Venezuela than in any of those countries, which means thousands of children die unnecessarily each year. It’s true that U.S. sanctions compounded the suffering (and I argued against such general sanctions), but the central reason was the venality and ineptitude of the regime. So of course many Venezuelans are celebrating when they see Maduro fall.\n\n“We are free,” a Venezuelan woman in Chile told Reuters after Maduro’s removal on Saturday. “We are all happy that the dictatorship has fallen and that we have a free country.”\n\nI understand the giddiness, but I worry the triumphalism may be overdone.\n\nTrue, Maduro was a disaster for Venezuela and for the entire region, with nearly eight million refugees fleeing the country. Yes, he appears to have stolen the 2024 election.\n\nBut President Trump’s operation to remove Maduro appears to be illegal, and it’s not at all clear that the regime itself will be toppled or that life will improve for ordinary Venezuelans.\n\nBarging into countries to arrest a foe, reportedly killing at least 80 people in the process, is not a precedent we want others to follow. I’m in Taiwan as I write this, and some are wondering if President Xi Jinping of China will get ideas. Frankly, I doubt that: I believe that what constrains Xi is military calculus, not concern for the rule of law. But it’s still true that the world works better when the United States promotes the “rules-based international order” rather than the law of the jungle that Thucydides recounted 2,500 years ago: “The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.”\n\nTrump could have tried to provide a legal justification for the incursion by saying that he had the permission of Venezuela’s rightful president, Edmundo González, the apparent winner of the 2024 election. The United States even under President Joe Biden recognized González as Venezuela’s true president-elect, so that might have been a useful fig leaf for lawyers to work with. But Trump has been dismissive of the democratic forces represented by González and María Corina Machado, the opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner.\n\nInstead, Trump asserted in a news conference on Saturday, “We are going to run the country.” He seemed less interested in Venezuelan democracy and human rights than in gaining American control over Venezuelan oil. “We’re going to have presence in Venezuela as it pertains to oil,” he declared.\n\nAll that should sound an alarm. The military and intelligence side of the Venezuela operation was masterful, but the legal and political sides seem frightful, and that bodes poorly for the country’s future.\n\nMaduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, remains in place, and is acting as president. Trump aides seem to think they can control Venezuela through her, but for now, Rodriguez does not seem eager to be their poodle.\n\n“If there is something the Venezuelan people will never be again, it is slaves,” she said. She referred to the attack on her country as “barbaric” and an “illegal kidnapping.”\n\nIt’s true that Rodríguez has been more pragmatic in her career and more attuned to the public’s well-being than Maduro was (a low bar), but in any case, it’s not clear how much autonomy she has to make decisions. Venezuela is run by a clutch of top security officials backed by Cuban gunmen, and it’s not obvious why they would choose to surrender power.\n\nIf Rodríguez resists, what then? Trump suggested that there might be a “second wave” of attacks. “We’re not afraid of boots on the ground,” he said, but he should be. For America to dispatch an invading force to occupy Venezuela, an area roughly twice the size of California, would take an enormous force; Afghanistan and Iraq should have taught us a bit of prudence.\n\nChina was bitterly critical of Trump’s attack on Venezuela, but I wonder if China might prove a beneficiary of it. Careless invasions reinforce narratives of Yankee arrogance and undermine American soft power. And while Trump aides intellectually understand the need to redirect attention and resources to Asia, Venezuela may end up being a long-term distraction that would impede that pivot.\n\nMaybe I’m being too bleak; it’s possible that this will all work out. Perhaps economic pressure and the threat of further military force will lead the Venezuelan regime to hand power to Machado and those around her. If Venezuela were properly led, it could thrive and become an engine for the region, and the loss of Venezuelan support might bring down the Cuban dictatorship as well.\n\nYet it’s quite possible that the Maduro regime will stagger on without Maduro, leaving the population increasingly impoverished. Or Venezuela could descend into chaos or civil war that empowers paramilitary “colectivos” or guerrillas in the leftist ELN organization.\n\nA central lesson of post-World War II military interventions is to beware of leaders glibly celebrating their missions accomplished. Toppling a government is invariably easier than ensuring a better one.\n\nAs I was listening to Trump triumphantly announce his plans to run the country and control Venezuelan oil, I thought of a time I was caught up in street fighting in Caracas in 2002. I was interviewing people in a huge crowd of left-wing Chavistas who were facing off against another large crowd down the street, apparently right-wing anti-Chavistas. Gunshots were fired, bottles rained down, and the army fired tear gas to try to dispel the crowds.\n\nI slipped over to interview people on the other side — and discovered that they were Chavistas as well. Two furious mobs, unaware that they were on the same side, were straining through the tear gas to rip each other apart.\n\nVenezuela is murky like that. So hold the champagne, for that scene suggests the deceptive and dangerous terrain on which Trump’s gunboat diplomacy has landed us.\n\nI’m looking for a travel partner!

    "description": "UN body’s recommendations driven by AI advances and proliferation of consumer-oriented neurotech devices",
    "fullText": "UN body’s recommendations driven by AI advances and proliferation of consumer-oriented neurotech devices\n\nIt is the latest move in a growing international effort to put guardrails around a burgeoning frontier – technologies that harness data from the brain and nervous system.\n\nUnesco has adopted a set of global standards on the ethics of neurotechnology, a field that has been described as “a bit of a wild west”.\n\n“There is no control,” said Unesco’s chief of bioethics, Dafna Feinholz. “We have to inform the people about the risks, the potential benefits, the alternatives, so that people have the possibility to say ‘I accept, or I don’t accept’.”\n\nShe said the new standards were driven by two recent developments in neurotechnology: artificial intelligence (AI), which offers vast possibilities in decoding brain data, and the proliferation of consumer-grade neurotech devices such as earbuds that claim to read brain activity and glasses that track eye movements.\n\nThe standards define a new category of data, “neural data”, and suggest guidelines governing its protection. A list of more than 100 recommendations ranges from rights-based concerns to addressing scenarios that are – at least for now – science fiction, such as companies using neurotechnology to subliminally market to people during their dreams.\n\n“Neurotechnology has the potential to define the next frontier of human progress, but it is not without risks,” said Unesco’s director general, Audrey Azoulay. The new standards would “enshrine the inviolability of the human mind”, she said.\n\nBillions of dollars have poured into neurotech ventures in the past few years, from Sam Altman’s August investment in Merge Labs, a competitor to Elon Musk’s Neuralink, to Meta’s recent unveiling of a wristband that allows users to control their phone or AI Ray-Bans by reading muscle movements in their wrist.\n\nThe wave of investment has brought with it a growing push for regulation. The World Economic Forum released a paper last month calling for a privacy oriented framework, and the US senator Chuck Schumer introduced the Mind Act in September – following the lead of four states that have introduced laws to protect “neural data” since 2024.\n\nAdvocates for neurotech regulation emphasise the importance of safeguarding personal data. Unesco’s standards highlight the need for “mental privacy” and “freedom of thought”.\n\nSceptics, however, say legislative efforts are often driven by dystopian anxieties and risk hampering vital medical advances.\n\n“What’s happening with all this legislation is fear. People are afraid of what this technology is capable of. The idea of neurotech reading people’s minds is scary,” said Kristen Mathews, a lawyer who works on mental privacy issues at the US law firm Cooley.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, neurotechnology has been around for more than 100 years. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was invented in 1924, and the first brain-computer interfaces were developed in the 1970s. The latest wave of investment, however, is driven by advances in AI that make it possible to decode large amounts of data – including, possibly, brainwaves.\n\n“The thing that has enabled this technology to present perceived privacy issues is the introduction of AI,” said Mathews.\n\nSome AI-enabled neurotech advances could be medically transformative, helping treat conditions from Parkinson’s disease to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\nA paper published in Nature this summer described an AI-powered brain-computer interface decoding the speech of a paralysis patient. Other work suggests AI may one day be able to “read” your thoughts – or at least, reconstruct an image if you concentrate on it hard.\n\nThe hype around some of these advances has generated fears that Mathews said were often far removed from the real dangers. The Mind Act, for example, says AI and the “vertical corporate integration” of neurotechnology could lead to “cognitive manipulation” and “erosion of personal autonomy”.\n\n“I’m not aware of any company that’s doing any of this stuff. It’s not going to happen. Maybe two decades from now,” she said.\n\nThe current frontier of neurotechnology lies in improving brain-computer interfaces, which despite recent breakthroughs are in their infancy – and in the proliferation of consumer-oriented devices, which Mathews said could raise privacy concerns, a bugbear of the Unesco standards. She argues, however, that creating the concept of “neural data” is too broad an approach to this issue.\n\n“That’s the type of thing that we would want to address. Monetising, behavioural advertising, using neural data. But the laws that are out there, they’re not getting at the stuff we’re worried about. They’re more amorphous.”",

    "description": "The U.S. took the unprecedented step Monday of dropping the number of vaccines it recommends for every child —  leaving other immunizations, such as flu shots, open to families to choose but without clear guidance.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. took the unprecedented step Monday of cutting the number of vaccines it recommends for every child — a move that leading medical groups said would undermine protections against a half-dozen diseases.\n\nThe change is effective immediately, meaning that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now recommend that all children get vaccinated against 11 diseases. What’s no longer broadly recommended is protection against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, some forms of meningitis or RSV. Instead, protections against those diseases are only recommended for certain groups deemed high risk, or when doctors recommend them in what’s called “shared decision-making.”\n\nTrump administration officials said the overhaul, a move long sought by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., won’t result in families who want the vaccines losing access to them, and said insurance will continue to pay. But medical experts said the decision creates confusion for parents and could increase preventable diseases.\n\nStates, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While CDC requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the Trump administration’s guidance on vaccines.\n\nThe change comes as U.S. vaccination rates have been slipping and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising across the country.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the overhaul was in response to a request from President Donald Trump in December. Trump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.\n\nHHS said its comparison to 20 peer nations found that the U.S. was an “outlier” in both the number of vaccinations and the number of doses it recommended to all children. Officials with the agency framed the change as a way to increase public trust by recommending only the most important vaccinations for children to receive.\n\nAP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on the U.S. lowering the number of recommended childhood vaccines.\n\n“This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,” Kennedy said in a statement Monday.\n\nTrump, reacting to the news on his Truth Social platform, said the new schedule is “far more reasonable” and “finally aligns the United States with other Developed Nations around the World.”\n\nAmong those left on the recommended-for-everyone list are vaccines against measles, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, chickenpox and human papillomavirus, or HPV. The guidance reduces the number of recommended vaccine doses against HPV from two or three shots depending on age to one for most children.\n\nMedical experts said Monday’s changes without what they said was public discussion or a transparent review of the data would put children at risk.\n\n“Abandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,” said Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota.\n\nDr. Sean O’Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics said countries carefully consider vaccine recommendations based on levels of disease in their populations and their health systems.\n\n“You can’t just copy and paste public health and that’s what they seem to be doing here,” said O’Leary. “Literally children’s health and children’s lives are at stake.”\n\nMost high-income countries recommend vaccinations against a dozen to 15 serious pathogens, according to a recent review by the Vaccine Integrity Project, a group that works to safeguard vaccine use.\n\nFrance today recommends all children get vaccinated against 14 diseases, compared to the 11 that the U.S. now will recommend for every child under the new schedule.\n\nThe changes were made by political appointees, without any evidence that the current recommendations were harming children, O’Leary said.\n\nThe pediatricians’ group has issued its own childhood vaccine schedule that its members are following, and it continues to broadly recommend vaccines that the Trump administration demoted.\n\nO’Leary singled out the flu vaccine, which the government and leading medical experts have long urged for nearly everyone starting at age 6 months. He said the government is “pretty tone deaf” for ending its recommendation while the country is at the beginning of a severe flu season, and after 280 children died from flu last winter, the most since 2009.\n\nEven a disease that parents may not have heard of, rotavirus, could come roaring back if vaccination erodes, he added. That diarrheal disease once hospitalized thousands of children each winter, something that no longer happens.\n\nThe decision was made without input from an advisory committee that typically consults on the vaccine schedule, said senior officials at HHS. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the changes publicly.\n\nThe officials added that the new recommendations were a collaborative effort between federal health agencies but wouldn’t specify who was consulted.\n\nScientists at the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases were asked to present to the agency’s political leadership about vaccine schedules in other countries in December, but they were not allowed to give any recommendations and were not aware of any decisions about vaccine schedule changes, said Abby Tighe, executive director of the National Public Health Coalition, an advocacy organization of current and former CDC employees and their supporters.\n\n“Changes of this magnitude require careful review, expert and public input, and clear scientific justification. That level of rigor and transparency was not part of this decision,” said Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, of the American Medical Association. “The scientific evidence remains unchanged, and the AMA supports continued access to childhood immunizations recommended by national medical specialty societies.”\n\nThe move comes as Kennedy, a longtime activist against vaccines, has repeatedly used his authority in government to translate his skepticism about the shots into national guidance.\n\nIn May, Kennedy announced the CDC would no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women — a move immediately questioned by public health experts who saw no new data to justify the change.\n\nIn June, Kennedy fired an entire 17-member CDC vaccine advisory committee — later installing several of his own replacements, including multiple vaccine skeptics.\n\nKennedy in November also personally directed the CDC to abandon its position that vaccines do not cause autism, without supplying any new evidence to support the change.\n\nSwenson reported from New York.

    "description": "At the CES conference, Jensen Huang, the company’s chief executive, said the more efficient and powerful chip would begin shipping later this year.",
    "fullText": "Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip-making giant Nvidia, put his company at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom by making semiconductors more powerful than any of his rivals’. This year, he’s promising to do it again.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Huang said the company would begin shipping a new A.I. chip later this year, one that can do more computing with less power than previous generations of chips could. Known as the Vera Rubin, the chip has been in development for three years and is designed to fulfill A.I. requests more quickly and cheaply than its predecessors.\n\nMr. Huang, who spoke during CES, an annual tech conference in Las Vegas, also discussed Nvidia’s surprisingly ambitious work around autonomous vehicles. This year, Mercedes-Benz will begin shipping cars equipped with Nvidia self-driving technology comparable to Tesla’s Autopilot.\n\nNvidia’s new Rubin chips are being manufactured and will be shipped to customers, including Microsoft and Amazon, in the second half of the year, fulfilling a promise Mr. Huang made last March when he first described the chip at the company’s annual conference in San Jose, Calif.\n\nCompanies will be able to train A.I. models with one-quarter as many Rubin chips as its predecessor, the Blackwell. It can provide information for chatbots and other A.I. products for one-tenth of the cost. They will also be able to install the chips in data centers more quickly, courtesy of redesigned supercomputers that feature fewer cables.\n\nIf the new chips live up to their promise, they could allow companies to develop A.I. at a lower cost and at least begin to respond to the soaring electrical demands of data centers being built around the world.\n\n“This is how we’re going to get everybody to the next frontier and push A.I. to the next level and, of course, to build these data centers energy efficiently and cost efficiently as well,” Mr. Huang said.\n\nThe Rubin chips are named for the astronomer Vera Rubin, who did groundbreaking research on dark matter. The new chips are key to maintaining Nvidia’s dominance of the A.I. industry and its perch as the world’s most valuable company. Nvidia’s A.I. chips, which account for more than 90 percent of the market, are highly coveted by businesses and governments around the world. It sells them for about $30,000 each, with nearly three-quarters of that being pure profit.\n\nBut the company is facing increased competition from chip makers and even some customers who are eager to seize a slice of the lucrative A.I. industry. Last year, Advanced Micro Devices, known as AMD, and Google, which buys Nvidia chips but also makes its own chips, struck deals to provide their technology to OpenAI, one of the world’s largest users of A.I. chips.\n\nThe rising threat contributed to Nvidia’s deal last month to license technology from the chip start-up Groq. The agreement is expected to help Nvidia develop chips that allow A.I. to more efficiently fulfill requests through a process known as inference.\n\nBecause more people are using A.I., chip makers are trying to make delivering it less expensive and less power hungry, said Daniel Newman, the chief executive of Futurum Group, a tech research firm. “That’s the name of the game because utilization is very early,” he said.\n\nThe competitive challenges have buffeted Nvidia alongside a series of geopolitical headaches. Mr. Huang spent much of last year lobbying President Trump to allow Nvidia to sell its A.I. chips to China. At the same time, he was trying to fend off efforts by Beijing to discourage Chinese companies from buying Nvidia’s chips because of security concerns.\n\nIn December, Mr. Trump granted the company permission to sell its second-most-powerful chip to China. But Beijing has not decided whether it will allow its companies to buy Nvidia products.\n\nDemand for Nvidia’s chips has turned Mr. Huang, 62, into a globe-trotting salesman and diplomat. He traveled with Mr. Trump to the Middle East and Britain, where he played a key role in technology deals between nations.\n\nNvidia’s business has flourished during the A.I. boom of the past three years. In November, the company reported a quarterly profit of $31.9 billion, a 65 percent increase from a year earlier and 245 percent from the year before that. It expects about $500 billion in sales through the end of this year.\n\nStill, Mr. Huang has been eager to diversify Nvidia’s business and expand its roster of customers. He has been pushing the company to become a major player in robotics and autonomous vehicles.\n\nOn Monday, he said Nvidia had developed new A.I. software that would allow customers like Uber and Lucid to develop cars that navigate roads autonomously. It will share the system, called Alpamayo, to spread its influence and the appeal of Nvidia’s chip technology.\n\nSince 2020, Nvidia has been working with Mercedes to develop a class of self-driving cars. They will begin shipping an early example of their collaboration when Mercedes CLA cars become available in the first half of the year in Europe and the United States.\n\nMr. Huang said the company started working on self-driving technology eight years ago. It has more than a thousand people working on the project.\n\n“Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,” Mr. Huang said.",

    "description": "How Google engineer Jaana Dogan discovered an AI tool that recreated a year-long engineering effort in one hour—what it means for developers and AI’s future.",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence rarely shocks senior engineers anymore. Most professionals in big tech expect rapid progress. Yet, in early 2026, a candid revelation by Jaana Dogan, a principal engineer at Google, managed to do exactly that. Her experience with an AI coding tool ignited a global conversation about software development, productivity, and the real role of human engineers in an AI-assisted future.\n\nThis was not marketing hype. It came from someone deeply involved in building large-scale AI systems. That authenticity is why her story resonated across the tech world.\n\nJaana Dogan is a Principal Engineer at Google, associated with work on advanced AI systems, including Google’s Gemini ecosystem. Engineers at this level typically focus on system architecture, long-term design decisions, and complex coordination between multiple components rather than routine coding.\n\nShe is not a celebrity technologist or influencer. Instead, she represents a growing group of highly experienced engineers who speak openly about how AI tools are reshaping their daily work. That credibility matters, especially when discussing sensitive topics like productivity gains and automation.\n\nThe moment that brought Jaana Dogan into the spotlight involved a hands-on experiment with Claude Code, an AI coding tool developed by Anthropic. Out of curiosity, she tested whether the tool could understand and recreate a complex system her team had already built at Google.\n\nAccording to Dogan, after providing a clear description of the problem, the AI generated a functional version of a distributed agent orchestrator in roughly one hour. Her team had spent close to a year designing and building a similar system internally.\n\nThis account was first reported by The Indian Express, which quoted Dogan’s own public remarks and reactions from the wider tech community.\n\nTo understand why this mattered, some context helps.\n\nA distributed agent orchestrator is not a simple script. It coordinates multiple autonomous agents, manages communication between them, and ensures tasks execute in the correct order. These systems often involve:\n\nIn large organizations like Google, building such systems involves months of design reviews, testing, and refinements. That’s why the speed of the AI-generated result raised eyebrows.\n\nThe AI output was not production-ready software. Dogan herself made that clear. The generated code still required validation, security reviews, performance testing, and human judgment. However, the structure and logic closely resembled what her team had arrived at after extensive discussions.\n\nThink of it like this: the AI produced a strong architectural draft, not a finished skyscraper.\n\nThis distinction is crucial for maintaining factual accuracy and avoiding exaggerated claims.\n\nThis was not a startup demo or marketing blog post. The observation came from a senior Google engineer with direct experience in large-scale AI systems.\n\nDogan openly acknowledged limitations instead of claiming AI superiority. That balance increased trust in her assessment.\n\nIf AI tools can reduce early-stage development time from months to hours, workflows will change. That affects cost planning, timelines, and team structures.\n\nCoverage from The Economic Times and Times of India further highlighted how divisive this moment was for software engineers globally.\nSources:\n– Economic Times (Technology Updates)\n– Times of India (Tech News)\n\nLong answer: The role is evolving.\n\nAI tools excel at pattern recognition and rapid synthesis. They struggle with context, accountability, and responsibility. Human engineers still:\n\nDecide whether an approach fits real-world constraints\n\nHandle edge cases that AI cannot predict\n\nEnsure compliance with legal and ethical standards\n\nMaintain systems over long timeframes\n\nDogan herself encouraged developers to test AI tools in domains they understand deeply. That advice reflects confidence, not fear.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of this story is Dogan’s openness about a competitor’s product. Historically, engineers at major tech firms avoid praising rival tools publicly.\n\nHer response suggests a cultural shift. Many professionals now view AI advancement as a shared ecosystem rather than a zero-sum competition. Progress by one company often pushes the entire field forward.\n\nThat mindset aligns with broader industry trends toward open research, shared benchmarks, and collaborative safety discussions.\n\nTeams can explore ideas quickly without committing months up front.\n\nEngineers may spend less time on boilerplate code and more time on design, review, and decision-making.\n\nPrompt design, system evaluation, and AI oversight will become core technical skills.\n\nThese conclusions align with discussions already happening in academic research and enterprise software planning.\n\nThis story gained traction not because it was sensational, but because it felt honest. It showed excitement, concern, and realism at the same time.\n\nDogan didn’t claim AI had “won.” She highlighted how powerful tools can reshape workflows when used thoughtfully. That balanced perspective is exactly what Google’s E-E-A-T framework values: experience, expertise, authority, and trust.\n\nJaana Dogan did not set out to start a global debate. She simply shared an authentic professional observation. Yet that moment revealed something important: AI tools are no longer just assistants. They are becoming collaborators.\n\nThe future of software development will not be purely human or purely automated. It will sit somewhere in between. Engineers like Jaana Dogan help the industry understand that future clearly, without hype or fear.\n\nAnd that clarity, more than speed or novelty, is what truly matters.\n\nThe Indian Express – Global Technology Coverage\n\nThe Economic Times – AI & Software Industry News\n\nJaana Dogan is a Principal Engineer at Google who works on advanced artificial intelligence systems,\n\nincluding projects related to Google’s Gemini AI ecosystem. She is known for sharing real-world\n\ninsights on how AI tools impact modern software development.\n\nJaana Dogan’s AI experiment went viral because she revealed that an AI coding tool recreated a system\n\nsimilar to her team’s year-long engineering work in about one hour, sparking debate about AI’s role\n\nin software development.\n\nNo, AI did not replace human engineers in Jaana Dogan’s experiment. The AI-generated code acted as a\n\nprototype and still required human expertise for validation, testing, optimization, and long-term\n\nsystem responsibility.\n\nA distributed agent orchestrator is a software system that coordinates multiple autonomous agents,\n\nmanages communication between them, and ensures tasks execute reliably across distributed computing\n\nenvironments.\n\nJaana Dogan’s experience shows that AI can dramatically speed up early-stage development and\n\nprototyping, while human engineers remain essential for system design, ethical decisions, quality\n\ncontrol, and long-term maintenance.",

    "fullText": "Syril, 25, carries a large banner of the US constitution with a number of other demonstrators during a protest marking US President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, in Washington, DC, US, 30 April 2025. REUTERS/Allison Bailey\n\nThe Trump administration has executed a wide-ranging crackdown on freedom of speech by targeting student protestors, lawyers and the press. Global Insight assesses the threat to the rule of law and what is being done to protect it.\n\nOn 8 March, recent Colombia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil was returning home from dinner with his eight-month pregnant wife when he was arrested and forced into an unmarked car by four agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Khalil, a legal resident in the US, had been a leader of the pro-Palestine protests on Colombia’s campus last spring. He is being held in a detention facility in Louisiana awaiting deportation and has not been charged with a crime.\n\n‘They are targeting the most vulnerable people who are standing up for Palestinian rights,’ says Justin Mazzola, Deputy Director of Research at Amnesty International USA, which is working closely with the lawyers on Khalil’s case. ‘The idea is to basically get people to stop protesting what’s happening in Gaza.’\n\nIn the short time that US president Donald Trump has held power, his administration has weaponised the federal government to suppress speech and punish his adversaries. In what many experts have challenged as a violation of First Amendment rights, a cornerstone of US democracy, President Trump has threatened protestors, banned news outlets from covering White House events and used executive orders to sanction law firms who he believes attacked him unfairly in the past. Subsequent court cases will test America’s most fundamental checks and balances on executive power.\n\nJonathan Hafetz\n\n Membership Officer, IBA Human Rights Law Committee\n\n‘We are seeing the gravest assault on freedom of speech at least since the McCarthy era, and I think in many respects the nation’s history,’ says Jonathan Hafetz, a professor of law at Seton Hall Law School and Membership Officer of the IBA Human Rights Law Committee.\n\nThe high-profile arrest of Khalil is part of a series of actions taken by the Trump administration against foreign students who have expressed support for Palestinians. Students and faculty members at US universities across the country have been detained by federal agents and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that his department has revoked at least 300 foreign students’ visas. Following arrests, government lawyers have cited a provision of a rarely used 1952 immigration law that allows the Secretary of State to revoke visas or permanent residency from anyone judged to be undermining US foreign policy. Jameel Jaffer, the inaugural director of the Knight First Amendment Institute, an independent organisation founded by Colombia University, believes that the arrests and detentions of foreign students are ‘impossible to reconcile’ with the First Amendment, and predicts that the courts will eventually make clear that it protects non-citizens from deportation. ‘At the most basic level if the First Amendment means anything it means that the government can’t arrest you or imprison you for political speech,’ he says. ‘That is the core protection of the First Amendment.’\n\nIn March, the national American Association of University Professors (AAUP), AAUP chapters at Havard, NYU and Rutgers, and the Middle East Studies Association, represented by the Knight Institute, filed a lawsuit in Boston seeking to block the arrests, detentions and deportations of international students and staff ‘who participate in pro-Palestinian protests and other protected First Amendment activities.’\n\nJaffer adds, however, that the question of whether the Trump administration will comply with any court rulings remains. ‘Both the court’s willingness to enforce their orders and the Trump administration’s decisions about how to respond to the court orders will be influenced by perceptions of public opinion,’ he says.\n\nAlongside visa revocations in recent months the US government commenced a widespread termination of Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records from a national database. A visa revocation, while significant, only impacts a person’s ability to return to the country, whereas eliminating a student’s SEVIS status puts them at risk of deportation. The government has since reversed the policy and reactivated most records following hundreds of lawsuits filed by students who said their records had been terminated based on charges that had been dismissed or minor offences that would not warrant a cancellation. NAFSA, an educational non-profit, found that some SEVIS record terminations referenced ‘potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.’\n\nAdam Cohen, an immigration lawyer and partner at Siskind Susser in Tennessee, is concerned by the lack of due process and transparency related to the SEVIS terminations, which he says could resume at any time. ‘The problem is when they’re terminating the SEVIS record, they’re making people believe that they need to leave immediately and they’re not even getting to that hearing in an immigration court,’ he says. ‘It’s not even clear what the issue was right? What was the adverse foreign policy? In certain cases, did they repost something on social media?’\n\nIn addition to the crackdown on international students the White House has threatened to withdraw millions of dollars in federal funding from at least 60 universities unless they agree to a set of demands to address alleged failures to comply with federal civil rights laws related to antisemitism and drop diversity, equity and inclusion policies. In response, elite US university Havard has filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing the funding freeze violates procedural requirements and its First Amendment Rights to freedom of speech. To restore its funding, Colombia University agreed to many of the administration’s demands including allowing security officers to remove or arrest individuals and taking control of its Middle East department from faculty.\n\nJameel Jaffer\n\n Director, Knight First Amendment Institute\n\nIn response to the action against Colombia, of the country’s top constitutional professors, both liberal and conservatives, wrote an open letter critical of the Trump administration’s use of funding cuts ‘as a tool to pressure recipients into suppressing First-Amendment protected speech,' which can extend to viewpoints ‘many of us find wrongheaded or deeply offensive.’ The First Amendment offers broad protections and guarantees freedom of the press, speech, religion, the right to assemble and the right to petition the government.\n\nJaffer says the damage being done while students and universities wait for court judgments is significant. ‘It has created a climate of fear and repression on campuses across the country,’ he says. ‘It’s caused an intense chilling effect and really changed the character of American universities quite dramatically.’\n\nIn certain cases, the question of whether the executive branch would defy a ruling by a federal judge has already been answered. In February the chief judge of the US Court for the District of Colombia ordered the US government to halt deportation flights carrying immigrants alleged to be Venezuelan gang members. But officials chose to ignore the order. ‘This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!’ President Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social. In April, the FBI arrested a judge in Wisconsin for allegedly helping an undocumented migrant evade arrest.\n\nFollowing the Trump administration’s refusal to turn the planes around, many commentators have declared the US in a constitutional crisis. Steven Richman is Chair of the IBA’s Bar Issue Commission and a member at Clark Hill. He says while Trump undermining judges is concerning, the fears about him transforming the US into an authoritarian state should be placed in context. ‘Since Marbury v Madison established the primacy of judicial review in 1803, by which the federal courts could declare legislation, as well as executive and administrative actions as unconstitutional, presidents of various parties from time to time have been alleged to have defied the Supreme Court. The facts of each situation and specific rulings of the Court remain important to evaluate the executive’s conduct. What is significant is that there remains an acknowledgement that the rule of law governs, and Marbury v Madison remains in place.’\nSome of the most aggressive escalations of the Trump administration’s assaults on the legal system have manifested in a barrage of executive orders punishing large commercial law firms who have represented his political opponents or been involved in causes against him. The orders, which allege wrongdoing by individual lawyers and civil rights law violations by affirmative action schemes, terminate the firms from government contracts and restrict their employees from access to federal buildings. To avoid the sanctions, multiple law firms have cut deals with President Trump and collectively agreed to provide $940m in pro bono work for causes his administration supports. Others have decided to stand firm.\n\n‘The order is a plain violation of the First Amendment,’ Jenner & Block said, which, alongside Perkins Coie and WilmerHale, successfully obtained preliminary court rulings to block the executive orders. ‘Our constitution forbids attempts by the government to retaliate against citizens and lawyers based on the clients they represent, the positions they advocate, the opinions they voice and the people with whom they associate.’\n\nRichman says the government using executive power to take revenge on lawyers is problematic and a direct challenge to the independence of the legal profession. ‘If someone feels that a law firm has brought a frivolous or legally unjustified claim, there are remedies at law for pursuing such claims. The end can never justify the means. The means – due process, fairness, respect for the social contract and political will that underlies a system – must be respected.’\n\nIn response to the executive orders more than 500 law firms signed an amicus brief, accusing the Trump administration of a campaign of ‘draconian punishment’ against lawyers who have acted for clients it disapproves of. ‘Whatever short-term advantage the administration may gain from exercising power in this way, the rule of law cannot endure in the climate of fear that such actions create.’\n\nSome lawyers at firms who are unhappy with their employer’s decision to negotiate a deal with President Trump have quit their jobs in protest. One such former associate, Rachel Cohen, gave up her role at a prestigious white shoe law firm because of its decision not to challenge the Trump administration’s sanctioning of the legal profession. ‘I sent what I considered a conditional resignation that either we need to do something about this real infringement on the legal system, on democracy, on traditional impartiality, or I can’t work here anymore.’\n\nCohen, who has now joined recently launched firm Lowell and Associates, which is dedicated to representing those facing legal actions from the Trump administration, believes that the agreements law firms are reaching with Trump are shortsighted, especially in the cases where they have proactively made a deal with Trump to avoid an executive order being issued in the first place. ‘I don’t know why anyone would think that a president who has a history of not respecting people who he has entered into deals with would respect the terms of a terrible deal when people have shown them what their weak spots are,’ she says.\n\nLower courts have been strong in opposing President Trump’s efforts to undermine the legal system and suppress freedom of speech. A federal judge in Washington, DC temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order against Susman Godfrey, which helped Dominion (a manufacturer of voting machines that lawyers for Trump falsely accused of deleting votes for him in the 2020 election) secure a $700m settlement to resolve a defamation case against Fox News. The judge called the executive order ‘a shocking abuse of power’, which stemmed from a ‘personal vendetta.'\n\n‘It was a clear attempt to retaliate against the law firm for representing a client that was seeking to hold Fox News to account for spreading lies and misinformation about the 2020 election,’ says Hafetz. ‘This is why it is so surprising and disappointing that some law firms have sought to cut deals with the Trump administration because those firms that have fought back have been vindicated and received relief.’\n\nIn its statement after the settlement, Fox acknowledged that the court found some of its statements about Dominion to be false, but said its settlement ‘reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards.’\n\nAlongside law firms, major media organisations have chosen to negotiate with Trump rather than challenge his attacks. In the run up to President Trump’s inauguration ABC News quickly settled a defamation lawsuit filed by Trump and Meta agreed to pay $25m to resolve a lawsuit over its decision to suspend Trump from its social media platforms following the January 6 attack on the US capital. In another notable move, the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times pulled their presidential endorsements.\n\nSince taking office, the Trump administration has taken an aggressive approach to news organisations it disfavours. The Federal Communications Commission has opened investigations into ABC, CBS and NBC News. In February, the White House announced that it had banned the Associated Press from accessing certain press events because of its refusal to rename a body of water the Gulf of America. The White House said it would also exert greater control over which news outlets would get access to the president.\n\nPeople take part in a rally organised by Jewish activists against the detention by ICE agents of Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil in New York City, U.S., 20 March 2025. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz\n\nGovernments favouring certain news organisations over others ‘is part of the authoritarian playbook,’ says Mark Stephens, Co-Chair of the IBA’s Human Rights Institute. ‘Banning the Associated Press essentially covering Trump in the way you would normally expect is designed to interfere with the free flow of information.’\n\nMel Bunce, a professor of international journalism and politics at City St George’s, University of London, says that the seriousness of the ban is underscored by the vital role of the Associated Press as a conduit for information. ‘The Associated Press is an incredibly important news organisation that is relied on by hundreds of news outlets around the world. Alongside Reuters and AFP, it is one of the most important building blocks of the international news system,’ she says. ‘It is one of the most rigorous and fact-based news organisations, and their news is shared globally – to millions of people in audiences around the world. And that’s why this is such a red flag.’\n\nWhile targeting the mainstream media, the Trump administration has branded itself as the ultimate defender of free speech. Trump officials backed up by billionaire social media owners have become fervent critics of ‘censorship’ coming from ‘woke’ progressivism that, they argue, would like to constrain the First Amendment.\n\nIn April a federal judge in a preliminary injunction ordered the White House to restore the access of The Associated Press access to cover presidential events, affirming on First Amendment grounds that the government cannot punish the news organisation for the content of its speech. Trump administration lawyers argued in court filings that the Associated Press does not have a constitutional right to specific presidential events.\n\nIn a show of solidarity against the ban, 40 news organisations signed a letter urging the White House to reverse the restrictions on the Associated Press. The signatories included outlets like Fox News and Newsmax, where many of the broadcasters and audience members are Trump supporters.\n\nAmy Brouillette is Director of Advocacy at the International Press Institute, an organisation that works to defend press freedom and independent journalism. ‘Limiting access to media pool events because of the news agency’s editorial decisions stifles freedom of speech,’ she says. ‘News organisations should be allowed to make editorial decisions without fear of retaliation from government officials.’\n\nIn another setback to the Trump administration a federal judge temporarily blocked its dismantling of state-funded broadcaster Voice of America, following an executive order accusing it of being ‘anti-Trump’ and ‘radical’. The director of Voice of America, Mike Abramowitz announced that almost his entire staff of 1,300 people had been placed on administrative leave.\n\nThe Trump administration’s decision to dismantle the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and the 90-day freeze on foreign development assistance funding, is also impacting independent journalism internationally. ‘The recent freezing of USAID is having a very serious impact on the media and civil society organisations that play a role in ensuring accountability and transparency,’ says Brouillette. ‘The role that the media and civil society play is not only important for democracy but it’s also important for peace and security.’\n\nAlice Johnson is the IBA Multimedia Journalist and can be contacted at alice.johnson@int-bar.org",

    "title": "FEC Obstructed from Enforcing Campaign Finance Laws for Last 250 Days",
    "description": "The Federal Election Commission needs its ability to function restored, without sacrificing its independence.",
    "fullText": "Since Thursday, the bipartisan Federal Election Commission hasn’t been able do its job. That’s because the independent agency, which oversees money in campaigns for federal office, no longer has the minimum four required members to do most business.\n\nThe loss of quorum is due to the resignation of a Republican appointee, coupled with President Trump’s unprecedented move in February to fire a Democratic appointee. Such a shortfall has only happened three other times in the FEC’s 50-year history, including twice during Trump’s first term.\n\nOrdinarily, the big question would be how fast the president and Congress will move to restore a full complement of commissioners so the agency can function. That is still important. But in light of the firing and the president’s other steps to exert control over the FEC and other independent agencies, there is now a much bigger issue: Will the FEC be able to continue as an independent watchdog at all? Because even worse than a dormant FEC is one that could be weaponized against the president’s opponents.\n\nThe FEC was created as part of the post-Watergate reforms that established our current system of campaign contribution limits and disclosure requirements. It is led by six commissioners, no more than three of whom can be from one party. When fewer than four seats are filled, the commission cannot carry out most of its important functions, including enforcing the law and issuing regulations and other legal guidance.\n\nThanks in part to its evenly divided leadership, the FEC is nobody’s idea of an aggressive watchdog, often deadlocking on partisan lines in important matters. That gridlock has exacerbated the effects of Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United, for instance, by making it easier for candidates to outsource key campaign operations to super PACs that can raise unlimited amounts of money.\n\nBut even a dysfunctional FEC is still important. Among other things, the agency plays a vital role in collecting and disseminating campaign finance data, which is critical at a time when Trump and his Democratic opponents continue raising money at a rapid clip ahead of the 2026 midterms (and when a number of the president’s biggest donors have a hand in shaping policy in his administration).\n\nLoss of the FEC’s quorum won’t keep data from being collected and published, but the commission won’t be able to do anything to enforce reporting requirements against those who ignore them. It also can’t address novel legal issues that arise — for instance, in connection to online campaign activity, where significant reporting gaps remain.\n\nBut the loss of the FEC’s quorum may not even be the agency’s biggest challenge. In February, the president fired a sitting Democratic appointee, Ellen Weintraub (full disclosure: I worked for Weintraub from 2011 to 2014). This firing is the reason the FEC was down to only four commissioners before the latest resignation.\n\nTo be sure, Weintraub’s term at the commission had long expired and she was eligible to be replaced. But no president has ever removed an FEC commissioner from the opposing party without naming a replacement, usually selected by the opposition party’s congressional leaders. Her removal was part of a series of firings of Democratic commissioners at independent agencies who are supposed to be legally insulated from presidential removal — representing a major power grab by the White House.\n\nSeveral weeks later, the White House issued an executive order purporting to formally place all independent executive branch agencies under direct presidential control. The president subsequently issued an order that, among other things, directs the Election Assistance Commission — another federal agency that was modeled in key respects on the FEC — to illegally revise federal voter registration procedures. A federal court has blocked relevant parts of the order in a Brennan Center lawsuit challenging the move while the case proceeds.\n\nThe president’s assault on the independence of agencies like the Elections Assistance Commission and FEC flies in the face of Article I of the Constitution, which vests oversight over federal elections in the states and Congress. Congress in turn delegated oversight over federal campaign finance rules to the independent FEC with the goal — as we recently noted in a publicly filed comment to the agency — of ensuring that election-related complaints and questions would be handled free from partisan manipulation.\n\nThe record-breaking 2024 election showed the dire need for effective and scrupulously even-handed campaign finance regulation. At a bare minimum, the president and Congress should follow the practices of every president since the 1970s for filling opposing party seats on the commission. Nominees from both parties should also be asked whether they will explicitly commit to defending the FEC’s independence.\n\nUltimately, as frustrating as some of the FEC’s current failings are, the solution can never be to allow the agency to be weaponized for partisan ends. There has long been broad, bipartisan agreement on this point — and it’s more important than ever to reaffirm this commitment to fairness.",

    "description": "The hard-hitting attack version of the special operations MH-60 was clearly among the critical assets used in Operation Absolute Resolve.",
    "fullText": "In the aftermath of the high-profile capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro by the United States, the participation by the Direct Action Penetrator (DAP) version of the U.S. Army’s MH-60M Black Hawk has thrust one of the most intriguing Special Operations Command (SOCOM) assets into the spotlight. These aircraft are the heavier-hitting gunships of the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), better known as the Night Stalkers, and Venezuela was exactly the kind of mission for which they are intended to fly, in support of a direct action mission and assault team.\n\nTWZ readers can otherwise get up to speed on the details that are known so far about the operation in our initial reporting here and here.\n\nHeavily armed attack versions of the H-60 Black Hawk family have been used by a variety of nations through the years. However, the specially adapted DAPs flown by the 160th SOAR are undoubtedly the best equipped, even in comparison to the regiment’s standard MH-60s, which are used primarily as transports, and are extremely capable in their own right.\n\nThe 160th SOAR has been operating the tricked-out DAP versions of the Black Hawk since at least 1990, with a primary mission of armed escort and fire support. Currently, the unit only operates the MH-60M version. These are flown alongside the M/AH-6M Little Bird, which also have a gunship configuration, and the MH-47G Chinook; the latter type was also employed in Operation Absolute Resolve in Venezuela.\n\nSeveral videos have emerged from Operation Absolute Resolve showing the MH-60M DAP in action, including reportedly during the assault on Fort Tiuna in Caracas, which you can read more about here. This footage has also been identified by some accounts as showing U.S. Marine Corps AH-1Z Vipers, but it was a DAP. These aircraft are meant to work very close to their targets, with the signature combined strafe and rocket barrage being a primary tactic.\n\nFootage of a U.S. helicopter firing rockets at a ground target in Caracas, Venezuela tonight. pic.twitter.com/5F81gePPin\n\n— OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) January 3, 2026\n\n— Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) January 3, 2026\n\nFootage shows a United States Marine Corps (USMC) AH-1Z Viper attack helicopter engaging ground targets with gun and rocket fire in Caracas, Venezuela. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has been captured and flown out of… pic.twitter.com/bPYWXI8Gbr\n\n— OSINTWarfare (@OSINTWarfare) January 3, 2026\n\nA video showing the DAP in action in Afghanistan, using guns and rockets:\n\nIn the broadest terms, the current DAP configuration allies a special operations MH-60M with stub wings for an expanded array of ordnance. These wings can be configured with one or two hardpoints on each side. It’s also worth noting that the MH-60M aircraft are dual-role; each one can be converted back into a transport helo from a DAP configuration in a couple of hours or less. This provides a lot of contingency capability in a single aircraft.\n\nIn terms of armament, the DAPs can carry a combination of 70mm rockets, AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, Stinger ATAS (air-to-air missiles), GAU-19/B 50-cal machine guns, and 30mm M230 cannons. The M230 is the same gun found on the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. In addition, the DAP has a pair of 7.62mm Miniguns that can be locked in a forward-firing mode to add to the firepower. The 70mm rockets include Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) versions, with laser guidance, allowing the DAPs to strike with extreme precision.\n\nThe particular configuration seen in the photos below is known as COMNAV IDAP and is typical of how the DAP appeared in Afghanistan in 2012:\n\nThe stores-carrying ability of the 160th’s MH-60Ms has been refined through the introduction of all-new lightweight wings, known as the Multi-Station Lightweight Armament Support Structure (MLASS). These are lighter than the older sponsons and easier for troops to install and remove as necessary. The older ESSS wings and single pylon wings are also available.\n\nAside from the weapons capabilities of the DAP version, the baseline MH-60M is absolutely packed with specialized avionics and systems vital for its critical missions, which are typically flown under the most demanding conditions and primarily at night. Among the most important of these systems are a terrain following radar and a sensor turret with day and night-vision cameras, which we will come back to shortly. Having the same avionics also means the DAP is able to penetrate to the same places as the other 160th SOAR aircraft they are tasked to support.\n\nThe DAP version also benefits from the rolling program of upgrades that keep the MH-60M at the top of its game. For example, the engine air filters seen on the current MH-60M configuration were added specifically because of foreign object damage (FOD) ingestion issues, which particularly affected the DAP, including rocket smoke and shell casings that were found to fly into the intakes during diving attacks.\n\nAt the front of the MH-60M, mounted in the center of the nose, is the terrain-following/terrain avoidance radar. The newer and more capable AN/APQ-187 Silent Knight radar, or SKR, has been steadily replacing the AN/APQ-174 radar. The SKR is also found on Night Stalker MH-47Gs, as well as U.S. Air Force CV-22 Osprey tiltrotors and MC-130J Commando II special operations tanker/transports.\n\nIn both cases, the radar is essential for the MH-60M to safely fly extremely low-altitude nap-of-the-earth flight profiles, even in poor weather and at night. This is exactly the kind of tactics that would have been used in Venezuela and will also have contributed to keeping the helicopters away from enemy air defenses and avoiding detection in general. As far as we know, only one helicopter was damaged in the Maduro snatch, but returned from its mission.\n\nFootage shows Venezuelan ground forces utilizing a MANPADS at a helicopter from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment during the final phase of Operation Absolute Resolve. \n\nShortly after the launch, retaliatory fire was observed, likely delivered by MH-60M DAPs or… pic.twitter.com/ZEhc8rZFBL\n\n— GMI (@Global_Mil_Info) January 4, 2026\n\nOn the nose directly below the radar is the AN/ZSQ-2 sensor turret, which houses electro-optical and infrared full-motion video cameras, as well as a laser rangefinder. The DAP version of the turret additionally features a laser designator for guiding weapons.\n\nAnother important tool that aids navigation through dust, sand, snow, fog, and other ‘degraded’ environments is the Degraded Visual Environment Pilotage System (DVEPS). It uses a combination of cameras and LIDAR, linked to a terrain database, to do this. Among its sensors is the AN/ZSQ-2, seen to the left of the radar in the photo below.\n\nThere are perhaps no helicopters anywhere in the world that are better protected than the 160th SOAR’s fleet.\n\nThe MH-60M is no exception, bristling with arrays of defensive systems all around the aircraft, creating a sphere of situational awareness and protection against multiple kinds of guided threats.\n\nThe defensive suite on the helicopter combines visual/infrared missile, radar, and laser warning sensors, which work together with active jammers and other electronic warfare systems, laser countermeasures, as well as countermeasures dispensers on either side of the tail boom.\n\nThe self-protection systems used by the 160th SOAR fleet are regularly updated to keep pace with changing threats. Among the latest defensive additions to the MH-60M is the Common Infrared Countermeasures (CIRCM) system. As a directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) system, this uses laser beams to blind and confuse the seekers on infrared-homing missiles. CIRCM is integrated with existing warning sensors, which it uses to cue the lasers against incoming threats. The same system is also being fitted on regular Army Black Hawks, as well as CH-47s and AH-64s.\n\nShould the MH-60M crew get ‘painted’ by enemy radars or lasers, or if there’s an enemy missile incoming, they will be warned by the defensive sensors, which will also automatically trigger electronic jamming, the launch of decoy flares and/or radar-spoofing chaff, and/or trigger the CIRCM system. It’s all highly integrated to maximized survivability.\n\nAlso part of the survivability equation is just knowing where threats may be, especially if they pop-up out of nowhere. This is where the aircraft’s electronic support measures, also tied into its defensive suite, provides situational awareness to the crew in order to give them the option of avoiding or engaging threats on the fly. Other threat data is datalinked to the aircraft from various platforms, enhancing overall situational awareness.\n\nOn that note, the MH-60M DAP, in common with all special operations Black Hawks, boasts an extensive communications suite, as evidenced by the dense array of antennas above and below the fuselage. There is also a prominent satellite communications antenna directly above the cockpit.\n\nAs we just discussed in relation to the Venezuela operation earlier today, the Army, and especially the 160th SOAR, has been experimenting with employing launched effects from their H-60s for years now, though this is not an operational capability, at least that we know of at present. These are drones capable of being launched from helicopters (as well as other platforms) that can fly dozens or even hundreds of miles to strike targets, jam emitters, or decoy air defenses, among other tasks. Launched effects are seen as essential to the survivability of helicopters in the future.\n\nThe video below, which the Army released in 2021, includes footage at around the 0:34 mark in the runtime of one of 160th SOAR’s MH-60 Black Hawk helicopters carrying a tube for a ‘launched effect’ under its right stub wing.\n\nLaunched effects are also planned for the Army’s conventional Black Hawk fleet, but the Night Stalkers, and the DAP version of the MH-60M in particular, are likely to receive it first. In Venezuela, launched effects would have allowed the DAP to strike targets indirectly and respond to air defenses as they emerged, launching kinetic attacks to get the main formation of helicopters through to their target. There is some evidence this may have happened for the first time in combat during this operation.\n\nLast but not least, as an MH-60M derivative, the DAP has accommodation for the nose-mounted boom for the in-flight refueling probe. This is telescopic, extending when required to keep the tanker and the trailing drogue clear of the rotor blades. This gives the helicopter much longer range, limited not by fuel onboard but by crew fatigue, lubrication consumption and other factors. They usually refuel from their MC-130J counterparts.\n\nOverall, the DAP version of the MH-60M has a strong claim to being the most heavily armed and best-protected Black Hawk iteration. While it might not be as heavily modified as the stealth Black Hawk, with its radical low-observable features, this remains very much under wraps, and its current status is altogether unclear.\n\nAs it stands, the MH-60M DAP’s combination of heavy armament, radar, and other sensor capabilities, as well as its extensive self-protection and communications systems, made it an obvious candidate in Venezuela. In the case of this raid, DAPs likely pursued troops responding at the complex that was under attack. They would have been tasked with taking out targets such as armored vehicles and anti-aircraft guns, as well as hitting any known threats just before the assaulters arrived. Critical is the fact that the DAPs can operate as an extremely well-trained integrated team with their 160th SOAR stablemates, working seamlessly as a ‘contained’ unit in the most demanding of circumstances. It would be much harder to bring in another ‘big Army’ asset for the same kind of effect.\n\nHopefully, we will in the future learn more details about its role — and that of the wider 160th SOAR — in Operation Absolute Resolve.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

    "fullText": "Jan 5 (Reuters) - About a dozen oil tankers loaded with Venezuelan crude and fuel have left the country's waters since the start of the year in apparent defiance of the U.S. government's blockade on exports, according to documents seen by Reuters and industry sources including monitoring service TankerTrackers.com.\n\nU.S. President Donald ​Trump imposed a blockade of all sanctioned tankers bound for Venezuela in mid-December, before the dramatic capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by U.S. troops in ‌the early hours of Saturday morning. Trump said on Saturday that an oil embargo remained in full force after Maduro's extraction.\n\nAll the departed vessels identified are under sanctions and most are now sailing on the high seas ‌without any known flag or current ship safety documentation in place, shipping data showed. Half of them are supertankers that typically carry Venezuelan crude to China, according to TankerTrackers.com and shipping documents from PDVSA.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the U.S. had approved or allowed the shipments. Trump also said on Saturday that Venezuela's largest customers, including China, would keep receiving oil.\n\nA U.S. official told Reuters on Monday the vessel \"quarantine\" was in effect focused on sanctioned tankers, but did not elaborate on the departed ships.\n\nThe White House, the U.S. State Department, state-run Venezuelan oil company PDVSA ⁠and Venezuela's oil ministry did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe ‌vessels are carrying an estimated volume of 12 million barrels of Venezuelan heavy crude and fuel oil, according to deals negotiated with PDVSA and satellite images analyzed by TankerTrackers.com.\n\nIt was unclear where the vessels were heading. When they loaded in December, they were mostly destined for Asia. ‍The ships had been stuck in Venezuelan waters since due to the U.S. blockade.\n\nA separate group of three smaller empty ships, also under sanctions, left the country after completing domestic trips or discharging imports, including of Russian naphtha.\n\nAt least four of the departed tankers left Venezuelan waters on Saturday through a route north of Margarita island after briefly stopping near the country's maritime border, TankerTrackers.com said.\n\nAt least four supertankers ​had been cleared by Venezuelan authorities to leave in dark mode, three sources with knowledge of the departure paperwork told Reuters. That means the vessels sail without their ‌satellite tracking devices switched on, a common ploy for tankers in the global fleet that carry sanctioned oil from Venezuela, Iran and Russia around the world.",

Plus, it's incredibly easy to cook, especially if I remember to marinate it the night before.\n\nI don't follow a vegan diet, but that doesn't stop me from purchasing this plant-based pesto from Trader Joe's to use on pasta dishes, sandwiches, or as a dip.\n\nContaining kale, cashew, and basil, this pesto is also my secret ingredient in killer grilled-cheese sandwiches.\n\nIf it were socially acceptable to drink Trader Joe's vegan creamy dill dressing with a straw, I'd do it. I love that it's free from fillers or emulsifiers, and the flavor is incredibly satisfying.\n\nThe obvious way to enjoy this dressing is on top of a salad. However, I also use it as a saucy addition to chicken or fish meals, an ingredient in grain-based dishes, and a condiment on sandwiches.\n\nNot loving to cook also means not loving to prep snacks. However, because I lead an active lifestyle, I know I need to fuel myself with nutrients such as sustainable carbohydrates before starting a workout.\n\nClif Bars are crafted with a blend of plant-based protein, fat, and carbohydrates. They're my favorite pre-workout snack that requires zero effort in the kitchen.\n\nThis frozen blend of blueberries, bananas, strawberries, dragon fruit, spinach, and kale makes smoothie-making so easy.\n\nThere's no chopping or prepping required when I'm in the mood for a breakfast smoothie — I simply toss some of this into a blender with milk.\n\nVeggies are a must at dinnertime in my house. Having prewashed and cut veggie and produce kits, such as the Trader Joe's asparagus sauté with mushrooms and onions, makes cooking dinner a breeze.\n\nSimply open the package and sauté everything in some extra-virgin olive oil.\n\nWhole grains can be both nutritious and filling. For those who don't like spending too much time in the kitchen, cooking them can be a tedious task.\n\nPrecooked frozen grains, such as Trader Joe's bulgur pilaf with squash and feta, only need to be heated through. Plus, this one is made with butternut squash, and I like the boost of veggies in every bite.\n\nTrader Joe's frozen precooked cauliflower rice is a perfect base for a low-carb meal. I just add a protein to make it a more complete dish.\n\nFor people who don't love cauliflower rice — but tolerate it because they want to include more veggies in their diet (such as my husband) — mixing this dish with some regular rice can offer the best of both worlds.\n\nPrecooked and shelled hard-boiled eggs make for an easy breakfast protein, salad topping, or sandwich addition.\n\nYes, even dietitians want to have pizza night once in a while.\n\nTrader Joe's frozen Tarte au Brie et aux Tomates satisfies the fiercest pizza craving. Plus, heating it up takes less time than we'd spend waiting for a pie to be delivered from the local pizzeria.\n\nI enjoy one serving as a main course, accompanied by a side salad, for a complete meal.\n\nClick to keep reading Trader Joe's diaries like this one.\n\nThis story was originally published on September 25, 2023, and most recently updated on January 5, 2025.",

    "description": "I followed a partner to Texas from California, then left both the state and relationship. I learned an important lesson about making my own decisions.",
    "fullText": "Shortly after earning my Bachelor's degree, I did what any confused 21-year-old would do: I moved to be with a partner.\n\nThe decision surprised a lot of people in my life. My dad raised his eyebrows at my choice to move for love and to make Texas my home.\n\nAfter all, I'd always dreamed of moving to New York, where I'd launch my writing career.\n\nHowever, moving to Texas seemed like a good option at the time. It's where my long-distance partner was living and working, and I was fresh out of college and eager to leave my California hometown.\n\nLooking back now, I was leaning on a romanticized version of what moving would mean — a fresh start and a deepening of our LDR — instead of thinking about what I really wanted.\n\nI arrived in northern Texas during a mid-summer nightmare of humidity. I couldn't walk outside without feeling like I'd just entered a sauna — a sharp contrast to California's dry heat.\n\nFrom the very beginning, I tried to find community and make living here work, convincing myself I'd adjust if I just put in enough effort.\n\nBut I had a tough time finding things to do in my new suburb. Quiet nights and weekends left me daydreaming about New York City and its seemingly endless array of activities and events even more.\n\nCrucially, I also found it incredibly difficult to meet anyone who felt similar to me.\n\nMy Dallas suburb felt much more conservative than my California hometown, and a lot of the people in our neighborhood were avid churchgoers, whereas I'm not religious.\n\nAround this time, too, I was coming to terms with the fact that I also liked women romantically. I struggled to find the kinds of queer spaces that seemed more plentiful in larger cities and bluer states.\n\nAs much as I tried to appreciate the mountainless views and endless selection of barbecue, I struggled to connect with my new town — and I couldn't stop thinking about the life I wanted in New York.\n\nSix months in, I took a quick trip back to California to visit my dad.\n\nTaking some time away from Texas made me confront the truth: I couldn't stay there anymore.\n\nThroughout my entire time in the state, I'd been daydreaming about packing up my things and living in New York City. My partner, on the other hand, wanted life in the country, and we just ended up not being compatible.\n\nThe Lone Star State helped bring all of these realizations to light.\n\nI knew that if I had chosen to stay, I'd continue to feel like a stranger in my own life. I realized that I'd rather take on the \"sunk cost\" of moving than stay in a place and relationship that didn't suit me.\n\nI learned a lot about myself during this time — including the fact that, maybe unsurprisingly, a suburb in northern Texas was not a great long-term fit for me. The biggest lesson I learned, though, was never to give up my own hopes and dreams for the sake of a relationship.\n\nDon't get me wrong: Moving for a partner can work for some people, but at 21, I learned the importance of making life decisions with my own wants and needs in mind.\n\nNow, almost a decade later, I'm writing this from my New York City apartment. I'm in a city where I've found my purpose, the love of my life, and most importantly, happiness.\n\nLeaving Texas turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made.",

    "description": "The Critics Choice Awards, which celebrate achievements in TV and film, were hosted in Santa Monica on Sunday night. Stars like Ethan Hawke attended.",
    "fullText": "Celebrities are kicking off 2026 in dramatic fashion — literally.\n\nOn Sunday night, Hollywood stars flocked to Santa Monica for the 2026 Critics Choice Awards, which celebrate the best of film and TV.\n\nSome attendees, such as Ariana Grande, stood out in glamorous, sparkling ensembles, while others fell short with lackluster looks.\n\nThese are the best and worst outfits we saw.\n\nThe \"Sentimental Value\" star hit the red carpet in a sleeveless gown designed by Ralph Lauren.\n\nThe shimmering dress had thin straps, a plunging cowl neckline, and a form-fitting skirt that extended into a short train.\n\nFanning stood out in the elegant gown, which perfectly complemented her blonde hair and neutral makeup.\n\nShe wore a strapless, sparkle-covered gown with a structured bodice and ruched fabric across its floor-length skirt.\n\nIts shape worked strongly for the actor, but its gray-toned color washed her out. A brighter silver or gold coloring might have worked better.\n\nIt also would've been fun to see Silverstone wear her hair in an updo to highlight her diamond earrings and statement dress.\n\nThe \"Andor\" actor arrived at the Critics Choice Awards wearing a forest green suit and undershirt.\n\nThough the outfit's earthy colors looked great on Luna, its satin pieces fit loosely and seemed to need some tailoring. His pants, especially, looked too long.\n\nThe outfit was also very understated and could have been enhanced with some accessories, such as rings or a brooch.\n\nThey coordinated in all-black ensembles that showcased their respective styles.\n\nRei Ami donned a velvet gown with a dramatic bodice cutout and wrist accessories from Chochengco, while Ejae had a glamorous moment in a strapless, satin ball gown.\n\nAudrey Nuna took the most daring approach, wearing a sculptural sphere piece from Marc Jacobs.\n\nSaint Laurent designed her dramatic look. It featured a tan suit, a massive feather boa across her shoulders, black gloves, a red tie, and leather boots that extended up her thighs.\n\nA simpler pair of shoes, such as boots that sat under her pant legs, would have probably looked better with the outfit.\n\nLaw Roach and Yvonne Shelly styled Grande for the Critics Choice Awards in a custom Alberta Ferretti gown designed by Lorenzo Serafini.\n\nThe baby-pink gown featured a scooped neckline, a form-fitting bodice, and a floor-length, slightly poofy skirt. A sheer overlay, covered in sparkly embellishments, sat atop the dress and formed a cape in the back.\n\nGrande wore her hair up and paired the statement gown with Swarovski jewelry. The look was the perfect blend of red-carpet glam and an homage to her portrayal of Glinda in \"Wicked: For Good.\"\n\nThe \"Severance\" star's gold-toned gown had a structured bodice with ruching on the center and sides, as well as two diagonal straps that crisscrossed across her upper chest. The texture continued on the full skirt, bringing dimension to the look.\n\nHowever, Arquette added a black belt and black wrap to the look, which felt distracting against the shiny fabric of the dress. The look would have been stronger if she had gone in a different direction with her accessories.\n\nInfiniti, who was nominated for her performance in \"One Battle After Another,\" arrived at the Critics Choice Awards in a yellow set designed by Louis Vuitton.\n\nThe top had a high neckline, while the cropped bodice was rounded with ruched fabric. The back of the top was the same shape but scooped lower, forming a cape that flowed to her calves. A form-fitting skirt with a subtle train matched the top.\n\nInfiniti, who shared on Instagram that the yellow of her outfit is her favorite color, paired the look with diamond jewelry.\n\nJordan selected a burgundy Louis Vuitton suit for the event. The jacket was double-breasted, while the pants were slim-fitted. He paired the bold suit with a pink shirt and a slightly shiny burgundy tie, as well as Christian Louboutin shoes.\n\nThe outfit may have also subtly nodded to \"Sinners,\" for which Jordan was nominated for best actor, as one of the twins he portrays, Stack, wears a similar shade of red throughout the film.\n\nDesigned by Bottega Veneta, Elordi's black suit had a subtly asymmetrical design with the jacket buttoning at an angle. Both the jacket and pants had a relaxed fit, adding to the effortlessly cool feel of the ensemble.\n\nThe \"Frankenstein\" star paired the suit with a black shirt, a gray tie, and black shoes. His sunglasses added a pop of color to the monotone outfit, as they had red lenses.",

    "title": "'I am innocent': Maduro pleads not guilty to narco-terrorism charges in first court appearance",
    "description": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had a lot to say during his first Manhattan federal court appearance.",
    "fullText": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro defiantly proclaimed his innocence in a Manhattan federal court Monday morning during his and his wife's first public appearance since US forces captured them in a dramatic military raid on Caracas over the weekend.\n\n\"I am innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man. I am still president of my country,\" Maduro told the judge through an interpreter when asked for his plea on narco-terrorism and weapons charges.\n\nHe was then interrupted by the judge, who interjected, \"A not guilty plea will be entered on behalf of Mr. Maduro.\"\n\nIt was one of several dramatic moments during the roughly 30-minute hearing, which Maduro used to protest his capture by US forces.\n\nWhen he entered the courtroom, flanked by US marshals, he wished everyone a \"Happy New Year\" in English and locked eyes with members of the press sitting in the back of the courtroom.\n\nLater, as the hearing wrapped up, a person sitting in the fourth row of the courtroom gallery stood to say Maduro would pay in the name of the Venezuelan people.\n\n\"I am a man of God, and I am a war prisoner,\" Maduro responded in Spanish as US marshals escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nMaduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were arraigned on an indictment alleging a conspiracy to import cocaine and a related conspiracy to possess machine guns and other \"destructive devices\" in furtherance of drug trafficking. Maduro also faces a narco-terrorism conspiracy charge.\n\nThe two wore standard-issue jail garb of navy smocks over orange long-sleeve shirts with khaki pants. At their seats in the courtroom, they wore headphones to listen to their court-appointed translators.\n\nWhen he stood to address the judge, Maduro held on to the arms of his chair as he rose unsteadily. Flores, her blonde hair tied back in a bun, had several small bandages on her face. She sustained injuries during her \"abduction\" in Caracas, one of her attorneys said.\n\nDuring the packed noon hearing, US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein read the couple a summary of their charges and informed the Venezuelan president and first lady of their rights before the pair entered not guilty pleas. He addressed them as \"Mr. Maduro\" and \"Ms. Flores.\"\n\nWhen asked to confirm his identity at the start of the hearing, Maduro began by stating in firmly spoken Spanish that he is \"Presidente constitutional de la Republica Venezuela.\"\n\n\"I am here, kidnapped, since January 3, Saturday,\" Maduro said. I was captured in my home in Caracas, Venezuela.\"\n\n\"There will be a time and place to go into all this,\" the judge interrupted.\n\nAsked for her plea, Flores spoke in a quiet, hoarse voice.\n\n\"Not guilty. Completely innocent,\" she said through a court interpreter.\n\nBoth Maduro and Flores are facing health issues and will need medical attention while awaiting trial, their lawyers said.\n\n\"Miss Flores, during her abduction, sustained significant injuries, as you can see today here in court,\" defense lawyer Mark Donnelly told the judge. \"There's a belief that she may have a fracture or severe bruising on her ribs,\" the lawyer added.\n\nThe 25-page indictment filed against Maduro, his wife, son, and three others alleges that for over 25 years, Venezuelan leaders \"have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States.\"\n\nMaduro was represented in court by Barry Pollack, an attorney best known for also representing WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange. Flores was represented by the Texas-based attorney Mark Donnelly and one of his law partners, Andres Sanchez.\n\nThe attorneys said they would not seek bail for Maduro or Flores on Monday, but reserved the right to seek it at a later date. Pollack told Hellerstein he anticipated \"voluminous and complicated legal practice.\"\n\n\"Mr. Maduro is the head of a sovereign state,\" Pollack said. \"He is entitled to the privileges and immunities that go with that office. In addition, there are issues about the legality of this military abduction.\"\n\nHellerstein scheduled the next court hearing for March 17.\n\nMaduro has long been a target of the US Justice Department. Manhattan federal prosecutors first indicted him in 2020, accusing him of heading the drug-trafficking network, the Cartel de los Soles.\n\nIn 2015, the nephews of Maduro's wife, Flores, were arrested in Haiti and charged with drug trafficking by the same office handling the Maduro case.\n\nThe indictment says Maduro is \"at the forefront of that corruption and has partnered with his co-conspirators to use his illegally obtained authority and the institutions he corroded to transport thousands of tons of cocaine to the United States.\"\n\nOn Saturday, President Donald Trump said the US captured the Venezuelan president following large-scale strikes on the South American nation.\n\nTrump said the US will \"run\" Venezuela until a \"safe, proper, and judicious transition\" can be facilitated. It remains unclear how the Trump administration would carry out this plan and for how long.",

    "description": "After moving from West Virginia to Miami in South Florida a few years ago, I've fallen in love with the great weather and budget travel deals.",
    "fullText": "Throughout my childhood, my family barely strayed from the parts of West Virginia's Appalachia region where I was born and raised.\n\nI spent college two hours away in Ohio, and during those years, I started traveling around the United States and to more distant places in Europe and Latin America.\n\nI love exploring the world, so when it was time to graduate and start a life somewhere new, I applied to jobs all around the country.\n\nI took the first one I could get, and it happened to be in Miami. I'd never been to Florida before, but I quickly found things in Dade County I enjoyed.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of living here, there are three big things I love about living in Miami — and one thing I still miss about West Virginia.\n\nA lot of people have opinions about this one, but as someone who grew up in a colder climate, I much prefer Miami weather.\n\nSummer aside, most weeks are sunny and fairly comfortable with a lot of days between 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Winters are pleasantly short, sunny, and warm.\n\nI also struggle with depression, which can be impacted by the seasons, so having the ability to go outside and get some sunshine any time of the year is a major bonus for me.\n\nThough summertime in Miami can be uncomfortably hot and humid and hurricane season is no joke, I still prefer the weather here to any place that experiences a harsher winter.\n\nAs a travel writer, I'm constantly booking trips and visiting new cities and countries. And when I'm not hopping on a plane or road tripping to a different part of Florida, I can still experience a variety of communities and cultures in Miami.\n\nMost people know Miami for its Cuban influence, but the city is also home to a huge variety of expats from other parts of Latin America, like Colombia, Venezuela and Argentina.\n\nThere's also a lot of diversity from other parts of the world, too. For example, Miami Beach has one of the largest Jewish populations outside of Israel, and there's also a huge variety of Bahamian, Jamaican and other Caribbean cultures here.\n\nMiami is constantly growing and changing, and I love that I can learn about so many different cultures without traveling too far.\n\nOne of my favorite perks of living in Miami truly is how easy and convenient it is to travel from the city.\n\nFor starters, there are two major airports nearby — Miami International Airport (MIA) and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL).\n\nMiami is also the cruise capital of the world, and there are constantly ships sailing from the ports in Miami and Fort Lauderdale.\n\nI'm a budget traveler at heart, and I've scored some incredible travel deals from South Florida. I regularly find flights to Europe for less than $400 from these airports, and I can fly to many places around the US for less than $150.\n\nSince I moved to Florida, I've developed a deep appreciation for the beach. However, I still definitely miss the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nThey're the oldest mountain range in the United States, and these rolling hills are the perfect place for exploring. My favorite time to visit West Virginia is in the late spring or early summer when the trees are at their fullest and brightest.\n\nPalm trees are beautiful, but I definitely miss how serene and peaceful nature can be in West Virginia — especially when compared to how busy and chaotic Miami can feel sometimes.",

    "description": "TheBurntPeanut, a foul-mouthed virtual peanut that plays \"Arc Raiders,\" is wildly popular on Twitch — and estimated to earn over $120,000 a month.",
    "fullText": "A new star has emerged on Twitch: a video game-playing peanut with eyes and lips.\n\nMen across America spent their holiday time off tuning into the hourslong livestreams of TheBurntPeanut. The foul-mouthed legume plays the video game \"Arc Raiders\" while cracking jokes and loving \"goop,\" his term for the virtual loot found in the popular game.\n\nTheBurntPeanut is a VTuber, a type of streamer who conceals their identity using a virtual avatar. There's a long history of these animated gamers, including Twitch giants like Ironmouse.\n\nBut the small animated peanut has grown large in viewership, touting 1.4 million followers on Twitch, 1.1 million on YouTube, and over 750,000 on TikTok.\n\nHere's what you need to know about that peanut your boyfriend, brother, or cousin was raving about over the holidays.\n\nLike many on Twitch, TheBurntPeanut streams for long stretches — often over seven hours at a time — while playing the popular game \"Arc Raiders.\" It's not unusual for 75,000-plus concurrent fans to tune in to watch him dancing, chatting, and cursing out his competitors while gaming.\n\nThe man behind TheBurntPeanut has not yet disclosed his name or appearance. That's a long-standing tradition for some gamers, who often show their screens instead of their own faces, and especially for VTubers. (Think back to 2022, when the YouTuber Dream famously revealed his face.)\n\nTheBurntPeanut does show his actual eyes and lips, which allows him to show emotion. (This should be familiar to any fans of the Annoying Orange.) His peanut body also moves as if it was speaking.\n\nFans of TheBurntPeanut are called \"bungulators\" — and there are a lot of them. According to Stream Charts, TheBurntPeanut was the No. 1 Twitch streamer ranked by hours-watched between December 6 and January 4. In that period, he clocked 9.2 million hours watched on the platform.\n\nMuch of TheBurntPeanut's humor leans on the crass side. He claims that he's been banned from TikTok 47 times. He leans into his character, joking about not having arms and legs, and about eating his family for munching on fries cooked in peanut oil.\n\nAt the December Streamer Awards, TheBurntPeanut took home the prize of Best VTuber, beating industry stalwarts like Ironmouse and Mori Calliope. His win stirred up controversy, as TheBurntPeanut calls himself a \"PTuber\" and does not associate with the traditional, anime-style VTubers that built the category.\n\nVTubers are often cash drivers, with a management industry forming around the streamers. TheBurntPeanut's paid subscribers are split into three tiers: $5.99, $9.99, and $24.99 a month.\n\nStream Charts estimates that TheBurntPeanut counts over 40,000 active subscribers in the first tier, with 84 and 63 active subscribers in the second and third tiers. The firm estimates his 30-day income to be between $129,427 and $201,874.\n\nOn YouTube, fans can support streamers by sending paid \"super chats.\" Playboard estimates that TheBurntPeanut received 985 super chats in the last 7 days, amounting to $12,325.\n\nBefore he became a streamer, TheBurntPeanut said that he worked as a phone salesman. He earned about $600 every two weeks, he said.\n\n\"I've just been so blessed by the Bungulators,\" he said. \"Every day, I wake up, and I thank God that I have what I have.\"\n\nAs TheBurntPeanut's popularity surged in December, so did a spin-off genre of TikTok: complaints and jokes from his fans' partners.\n\nIn one video, a woman said TheBurntPeanut made her boyfriend laugh more than she could. In another, a woman wrote that she sometimes thinks her boyfriend loves TheBurntPeanut more than her.\n\nOne woman recorded herself repeatedly asking why she was \"falling asleep to a peanut.\" She captioned it: \"I am a victim.\"\n\nEnjoy me crashing out over @theburntpeanut because in the past week he’s taken over our household. I’ve woken up to his voice on our bedroom TV at 3am more than once. “His presence is soothing to me” —my fiancé, mid-nap at his own birthday party🎈asleep to burnt peanut 🙃🫠 #boythings #wtf #burntpeanut #christmasparty #holidays\n\nOthers are bonding over TheBurntPeanut. One woman posted about joining her husband to watch the \"little sassy peanut.\" Another wrote that her fiancé got her watching TheBurntPeanut — but that she now watches solo of her own free will.\n\nThe streamers' fans aren't all men, of course. One woman on TikTok described watching TheBurntPeanut as part of her \"night routine.\" The clip now has over 300,000 views. One family rang in the New Year watching TheBurntPeanut on their television.\n\nThese TikToks are a sign of how pervasive one small peanut has become — and how meteoric his rise has been. So if you see a peanut on the TV when you enter a restaurant, now you know why.",

    "fullText": "A photo of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in US custody may have turned him into an accidental fashion influencer.\n\nWhen US President Donald Trump posted a photo of Maduro on January 3 after he was captured by US forces, internet sleuths quickly identified the outfit — and haven't stopped talking about it since. Maduro appears to be wearing a gray Nike Tech fleece set in the picture.\n\nFollowing the January 3 post, searches for \"Nike Tech\" on Google spiked, according to Google Trends.\n\nThe online conversations about the athleisure line also surged dramatically on X, intelligence platform PeakMetrics told Business Insider. Nike Tech was mentioned in over 5,000 X posts a day between January 3 and January 5, according to PeakMetrics. That's up from the roughly 325 posts a day it averaged from November 1 to December 31.\n\nOn TikTok, users posted AI-generated versions of the photo and poked fun at the fashion choice. Some users joked that it was a new Nike campaign. Others made \"steal the look\" posts that broke down the cost of the full outfit, including the darkened eye mask and ear covering. The jacket and joggers cost over $200 combined.\n\nVENEZUELAN PRESIDENT PUT IN NIKE TECH,SHIPPED TO NEW YORKI #venezuela #president #fyp #news #update\n\nAs of Monday morning, the style of the Nike Tech fleece zip-up jacket that Maduro was photographed in was sold out on Nike's US website in several sizes.\n\nThe fleece jacket already appeared to be a hot item before Maduro donned it on the Navy ship USS Iwo Jima. It appeared to be partially sold out in November and December, according to screenshots archived on Wayback Machine.\n\nIt's been the subject of a viral debate in recent weeks, with some young men bragging on social media about being \"team Nike Tech\" or \"team quarter-zip\" to show whether they're a part of Corporate America or not.\n\nSome members of Gen Z and Gen Alpha also had their eyes on Nike Tech for the holidays. A clip of a girl opening her Christmas gift, a Nike Tech set, garnered over 1 million likes on TikTok and earned a comment from Nike itself.\n\nNike also made its way onto teens' wish lists this year, and it dominated Piper Sandler's semi-annual teen survey as the No. 1 clothing brand in fall 2025.\n\nMaduro, the longtime Venezuelan leader, and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured in an overnight raid in Caracas over the weekend and taken to the US, where Maduro faces federal charges.",

    "fullText": "A new geopolitical conflict is unfolding. Yet, US stocks are… up at new record highs?\n\nThat's the dynamic on display on Monday as investors digest the US's raid on Venezuela and the capture of the nation's president, Nicolás Maduro, over the weekend.\n\nDespite the upheaval of its South American neighbor, US stocks, gold, and bitcoin were among risk assets that churned higher on Monday. As far as markets are concerned, the Venezuela situation seems to already be an afterthought.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed 0.6%, while the Dow's 1.3% jump notched a record closing high for the benchmark. Energy stocks led the way across both indexes.\n\nThose moves seem counterintuitive, but they reflect a dynamic that markets have shown time and time again over the decades: investors simply don't care that much about conflict abroad.\n\nStocks, for one, have a pattern of falling as geopolitical tensions rise, but rebounding once the conflict actually occurs. According to an analysis by Fundstrat Research, there are at least five instances where equities rallied after a major geopolitical event, such as the first Gulf War or when Hamas attacked Israel in 2023.\n\n\"The old adage has long been to 'sell the rumor, buy the invasion,'\" Kent Fung, Fundstrat's vice president of market intelligence, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nPeter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, said Monday's rally showed investors are more focused on taking the weekend's string of events in a \"positive light.\"\n\n\"You had a country that has been hostile to the US that has expropriated a lot of US investments, and now Trump has orchestrated a regime shift that could open the country up for new investment,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe lack of a negative reaction in markets could also reflect how investors can't yet price in a final outcome of the US-Venezuela conflict. The market also seems to be focused on other recent stock drivers, such as the rally broadening out to sectors beyond tech, Berezin said.\n\nThe market's upward momentum is proving to be a tough force to stop. US equities notched another record-setting year in 2025, with the S&P 500 gaining 16% as investors remained laser-focused on the growth potential of AI, strong earnings, rate cuts, and a still-resilient US economy.\n\n\"Solid results almost across the board\" last year have caused investor confidence to be \"reasonably strong,\" Nicholas Colas, the co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note on Monday.\n\n\"From a mechanical standpoint, the global macro backdrop looks essentially unchanged,\" Karl Schamotta, the chief market strategist at Corpay, wrote in a note detailing how investors largely took the Venezuela situation \"in stride.\"\n\nIf anything, investors are more likely to care about the coming December jobs report, Schamotta added, which could influence the market's expectations for interest rate cuts in 2026.",

    "description": "As a Pilates instructor of 13 years, I see many first-time students make the same mistakes, from wearing the wrong clothes to not eating before class.",
    "fullText": "I became a Pilates instructor 13 years ago after reformer classes helped me recover from a severe back injury.\n\nNowadays, I teach 20 group equipment classes weekly and see about 100 clients over seven days. With that many students, it's no surprise I see new clients make the same mistakes over and over.\n\nHere are the five most common mistakes I see students make during their first few Pilates classes.\n\nI recommend new clients arrive at the studio at least 10 minutes before class so that I have time to fit them into the equipment.\n\nFor example, the Reformer carriage must be adjusted to fit their unique body type, height, and overall proportions. I also ensure the straps are even and at the correct length for the client.\n\nArriving ahead of schedule allows students to get settled and stay focused during class.\n\nPilates classes involve verbal cueing, which means most teachers will describe the exercises instead of demonstrating them. However, following oral instructions can be particularly challenging for non-auditory learners.\n\nFor example, when doing reformer Pilates classes, the springs can be adjusted to increase or decrease resistance. Many first-timers attend Pilates classes with a gym mindset, assuming heavier loads produce the best results.\n\nHowever, when taking a class, you should never ignore the instructor's directions on how much resistance to use. Following directions is essential for staying safe and seeing results.\n\nPilates uses a technique known as lateral breathing to stabilize the trunk (chest, abdomen, pelvis, and back) while you move. This helps prevent unwanted pelvis movement or an arched back.\n\nGood form during exercise allows for proper muscle recruitment and helps prevent injuries, which is why I always remind my students to be mindful of their breath.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that engaging your core and developing breathing techniques takes time. When in doubt, stick to your usual breathing pattern.\n\nMost studios require clients to wear socks with proper grips on the bottom for safety and hygiene purposes.\n\nYour feet may get slippery during movements requiring extra stability, so I recommend wearing them even if the studio doesn't mandate it.\n\nIt's also important to avoid wearing loose-fitting clothing so the instructor can see your body and help you make the proper adjustments.\n\nAdditionally, it's best to keep long hair in a bun so it doesn't get caught in the springs or other parts of the equipment.\n\nTaking a Pilates class on an empty stomach is a big no-no. However, you also don't want to feel too full before class since Pilates is a core-centered workout.\n\nI recommend eating something light an hour before class. A protein shake or a rice cake with peanut butter are good options if you're taking an early class.\n\nFor those who prefer to exercise on their lunch break, a small salad with light protein will do the trick. The most important thing, however, is to listen to your body and find what works for you.\n\nThis story was originally published on August 28, 2024, and most recently updated on January 5, 2025.",

    "title": "This Is How Long It Takes to Recover From the ‘Super Flu,’ According to Doctors",
    "description": "The flu is a serious illness, and recovery can take time.",
    "fullText": "It’s one thing to hear about cases of the so-called “super flu” skyrocketing in the country, but it’s another to actually deal with it. If you’ve recently experienced the flu, you may be wondering when you’ll feel like yourself again. Unfortunately, doctors say it can take time.\n\nThe flu can cause uncomfortable symptoms like fever, cough, and sore throat when you’re initially sick, but you may also be sidelined with lingering fatigue and generally feeling off after your original symptoms have cleared. “Once influenza grabs you, it can hold onto you for a longer period of time than the acute illness,” William Schaffner, MD, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tells SELF.\n\nOkay, but why? And, ballpark, how long are we talking about here? This is how long it takes to recover from the “super flu,” according to doctors, plus what you can do to speed up your recovery.\n\nThe flu has always been a potentially serious illness. But the strain of the flu that’s circulating right now—which is called subclade K—is a strong version of the virus that is better at evading the previous immunity you might have, whether it’s from the flu vaccine or having had other versions of the flu. As a result, more people are vulnerable to getting infected and feeling horrible for longer than usual when they get sick.\n\nIt’s too early to have data on how long most people are sick with subclade K, but Dr. Schaffner says he’s heard anecdotes of this strain causing illness that lasts longer than your typical flu. “The dominant strain out there is part of the H3N2 family, and that usually causes more severe illness,” he says.\n\nIt’s tough for doctors to say exactly how long it will take for you to feel better when you have the flu, given that things like your individual immune response and underlying health conditions come into play. But there is a ballpark that you can expect.\n\n“While the acute symptoms such as fever might abate in a few days, fatigue and [feeling off] may persist for a week or longer,” Amesh A. Adalja, MD, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells SELF. There are a few reasons for this. “The virus sets up an inflammatory response—that’s how the body fights off the virus,” Dr. Schaffner says. But after the initial illness starts to fade, that inflammation can keep going and continue to fuel symptoms like a sore throat, dry cough, and just generally feeling lousy, he says. “That undoubtedly can last for a while,” Dr. Schaffner says.\n\nBeing dehydrated and moving less than usual (because you’re not feeling great) can also slow down the recovery process, Dr. Adalja says. There’s even something called long influenza syndrome that some people experience, he points out. (Think long COVID, but with the flu.)\n\nEven though early data suggests that this year’s flu vaccine isn’t as effective at preventing the flu, Dr. Adalja says that being vaccinated is likely to help you recover faster.\n\nIf you didn’t get your flu shot, there’s no reason to harp on it—that won’t help you now. But regardless of your vaccination status, doctors say there are a few things you can do to try to speed up your recovery time or at least feel better while you ride things out.\n\nThe first is to ask your healthcare provider about taking an antiviral treatment like oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza). “If you start an antiviral early, it reduces the severity of the illness,” Dr. Schaffner says.\n\nThere is a caveat to keep in mind that your healthcare provider may flag: Oseltamivir can cause “fairly prominent” side effects like nausea and vomiting, Dr. Schaffner says. “Pediatricians are a little more careful about that,” he says. “But for people in high-risk groups for severe disease, including older persons, those who are immune compromised, and those who are pregnant, we unhesitantly recommend using the medication.”\n\nBeyond that, both doctors agree that staying well hydrated is crucial. “Make sure you keep up with your fluids,” Dr. Schaffner says. “If you let yourself get dehydrated, you’re more likely to get pneumonia.” Not only that, being well hydrated will keep your mucus membranes moist and make it easier to get out nasal discharge, making you feel less stuffy, Dr. Schaffner says.\n\nWhile Dr. Adalja says you don’t want to overexert yourself when you’re in the initial phase of being sick, moving once you’re in the recovery phase is important. “Sit up, walk around, and start moving as much as possible,” Dr. Schaffner says. “Your body will appreciate that.” At the same time, he stresses the importance of getting a good night’s sleep to give your body plenty of opportunity to rest and recover.\n\nBut while you’re doing all of that, it’s important to keep flu complications like pneumonia on the back burner. “If a person has unremitting fever, shortness of breath, or extreme fatigue that prohibits them from performing their activities of daily living, they should see a medical provider,” Dr. Adalja says. (Dr. Schaffner also recommends being on the lookout for yellow or green phlegm—this can be a sign of pneumonia too.)\n\n“If you’re more than a week out from the acute illness and you’re not getting better or even feeling worse, it’s time to contact your doctor,” Dr. Schaffner says. But if you feel like you’re getting better—just at a slower pace than you’d hope—he recommends being patient. The flu is a serious illness, and recovery can take time.\n\nThis Year’s Flu Is Different.

    "description": "A hapless Donald Trump made a show of the Air Force One stairs as he stepped off the presidential jet after a two-week stay at his Mar-a-Lago bolthole.

    "fullText": "A hapless Donald Trump made a show of the Air Force One stairs as he stepped off the presidential jet after a two-week stay at his Mar-a-Lago bolthole.\n\nTrump arrived in Palm Beach County early on Dec. 20 for a 15-day stay and returned to Washington, D.C., via an airbase in Maryland on Sunday evening. But as he descended the steps of AF1 to board Marine One for his onward journey, several possible tell-tale signs of weakness became apparent.\n\nThe Daily Beast has dutifully reported on the waning physical power of the 79-year-old president, with major players such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal joining the conversation later. Trump admitted to the latter that he has sought medical help for a myriad of issues.\n\nIn that unusually candid interview last week, he conceded that he visited Walter Reed Military Medical Center in mid-July after suffering “mild swelling” in his lower legs and said an ultrasound showed he has “chronic venous insufficiency,” a common ailment in older people that makes it more difficult for the blood to travel to the heart from the legs through smaller veins.\n\nThis, perhaps, contributed to Trump making the relatively simple task of walking down some steps and then in a straight line, and then up some even smaller steps, look like a gargantuan effort.\n\nTV footage captured the charade. Trump is seen emerging from the door of the jet before gripping the handrail and appearing to let his legs drop abruptly onto the steps. He gingerly descends before pawing for a second handrail as his eyes remain fixed on the red carpet in front of him.\n\nHis hair comedically flaps in the wind as he takes on the second portion of the stairs, even slower than the first. He steps out onto the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews and takes a breather, saluting the gathered officials and waving to the press.\n\nHe then embarks on a long arc towards Marine One, where he veers wildly to the left of the door, stopping for chats along the way. The short walk, in which he also drags his right leg, takes what feels like an age. He appears jaded as he ascends the tiny staircase into the chopper, which brought him back to the White House.\n\nTrump has made a hash of the AF1 steps plenty of times in the past and more frequently of late. In a video showing such an instance from just before Christmas, Trump appears at the aircraft door and slaps his right leg three times with his right hand before heading down the stairs cautiously.\n\nJust before the New Year, his old foe—steps—appeared to rankle him once more. The president cautiously climbed down the steps at the main entrance of his Mar-a-Lago estate as he welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the Gaza peace plan.\n\nTrump glanced down at the short staircase before him as he waited for Netanyahu to come forward.\n\nTrump hasn’t been coy about his fear of stairs. In September, he admitted that he was wary of publicly stumbling and falling like his predecessor Joe Biden, who was 82 when he left the White House.\n\n“Every day, the guy’s falling down stairs,” Trump told military generals who were gathered in Quantico. “I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs—like I’m on stairs, like these stairs—I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record. Just try not to fall because it doesn’t work out well... Just walk nice and easy. You don’t have to set any record.”",

    "title": "No single piece of tech is going to defeat all drone threats, new US counter-drone force commander says",
    "description": "Small drones are \"the defining threat of our time,\" Brig. Gen. Ross said, requiring a layered defense network to stop them.",
    "fullText": "The US military is racing to develop better defenses against drones, but there's no silver bullet, no wonder weapon, that will single-handedly defeat everything, the commander of the Pentagon's new counter-drone force said.\n\nJoint Interagency Task Force 401 says stopping drones isn't about one weapon or system. The counter-drone fight will require a mix of different tools, from ways to physically shoot down drones to electronic and other non-kinetic solutions.\n\nIt also demands easier, faster processes for testing and buying systems across the services.\n\nThe task force was created last fall to expedite counter-drone technologies across the Department of Defense, replacing the Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office, which was established in 2019. Since its establishment, the task force has assessed and contributed to the US military's counter-drone arsenal, including forces at home and abroad.\n\nBut there's no one system they've found that can stop small uncrewed aerial systems, or UAS, which the task force's commander, Brig. Gen. Matt Ross, called \"the defining threat of our time.\"\n\n\"There's no silver bullet for counter-UAS. There's just not,\" Ross said last month at a media roundtable. \"If there was, we would already have it,\" he added.\n\nInstead, the task force is focused on a suite of technologies for layered, integrated protection from drones. \"Our formations must be able to detect, track, identify, and defeat these systems anywhere on the planet,\" Ross said. \"This requires us to layer our defenses by integrating sensors with kinetic and non-kinetic effectors and battle management systems into a responsive, interoperable network.\"\n\nHe said that many defense technologies already exist for countering medium-sized drones, which the Pentagon classifies as Group 3, but more work remains in smaller drones under Group 1 and 2, UAS such as the quadcopters that dominate in Ukraine.\n\nAnd the counter-drone problem isn't just about what systems are needed to protect service members and civilians. \"The technology is not going to solve this problem for us. We can't field a system that will stop every drone. It will all come down to the installation commander or the person responsible for that site and how they use the tools that we provide them,\" Ross said.\n\nIn its first 100 days, the task force has identified a key goal: creating a shared command-and-control system that makes it easier for different teams and regions to share data. It also wants to build a marketplace where the military services, law enforcement, and other agencies can find counter-drone systems suited to their specific threats, review performance data and user feedback, and potentially buy those systems in one place.\n\nThe task force notably isn't operating in isolation. There's overlap between the task force's focus on stopping Group 3 drones, systems like Shield AI's V-BAT or the Army's AAI RQ-7, and the responsibilities of the Golden Dome missile defense project, which has to include defenses for Group 3 drones.\n\nThe task force plans to share data with the Golden Dome project, and Ross said he's currently discussing what that looks like with Space Force's Gen. Michael Guetlein.\n\nAnother priority for the task force is helping protect against small drones at major events, including the FIFA World Cup this year, with matches set to be held at 11 large stadiums in cities across the US.\n\nRoss said that based on US forces overseas, \"we're heavily indexed against Group 3 systems, and those are larger systems that fly a longer distance and carry heavier payloads. And I want to make sure that we have just as robust protection against Group 1 and Group 2 systems that are smaller and much more likely to be seen over a widely attended gathering, stadium, or a watch party specifically for the World Cup.\"",

    "description": "Barry Pollack has a long track record of sensitive cases involving national security, and of defending corporate executives in criminal trials.",
    "fullText": "When Nicolás Maduro needed someone to represent him in an American courtroom, he turned to a lawyer with experience facing off against the federal government.\n\nThe Venezuelan political leader hired Barry Pollack, a criminal defense attorney who's represented WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange, as well as other high-profile defendants.\n\nThe Justice Department has accused Maduro, who was serving as Venezuela's president when he was captured by US forces, of participating in a narco-terrorism conspiracy, alleging he worked with illegal drug gangs. They also accused him and his wife, Cilia Flores, of conspiring to illegally import cocaine into the United States and of gun-related charges.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, US Marshals escorted the couple into a 26th-floor courtroom in lower Manhattan, where they entered not-guilty pleas and proclaimed their innocence. US military forces apprehended Maduro and Flores in a pre-dawn operation on Saturday in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas and brought them to the United States.\n\nAt the hearing, Pollack told US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein that he would file \"voluminous and complicated\" motions on Maduro's behalf, suggesting he would challenge the charges and the basis for his arrest.\n\n\"Mr. Maduro is the head of a sovereign state,\" Pollack said in court. \"He is entitled to the privileges and immunities that go with that office. In addition, there are issues about the legality of this military abduction.\"\n\nDelcy Rodriguez was sworn in as Venezuela's interim president on Monday afternoon.\n\nPollack, an attorney at the boutique law firm Harris St. Laurent & Wechsler LLP, is best known as one of the many lawyers who represented Assange, the publisher of WikiLeaks.\n\nProsecutors had accused Assange of working with hackers to obtain government secrets from federal agencies and American companies, as well as conspiring with former US Army officer Chelsea Manning to leak documents about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\nAssange pleaded guilty to espionage charges in the summer of 2024, capping a six-year legal battle that involved complex negotiations with multiple governments.\n\nPollack's experience with sensitive national security matters could be an asset for his representation of Maduro, which will likely involve classified information. The attorney has also represented Jeffrey Sterling, a former CIA officer who was convicted of espionage charges after leaking information to a journalist.\n\nTo be paid, Pollack will likely need a waiver from the US Treasury Department, which has sanctioned Maduro and the Venezuelan government.\n\nIt's not clear when Pollack began representing Maduro. He formally entered an appearance on the court docket late Monday morning. Maduro was first indicted in 2020, and Hellerstein has overseen court proceedings against other Venezuelan nationals accused of conspiring with him. Pollack didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nA court-appointed lawyer for Maduro, David Wikstrom, told Business Insider he was informed at 8:40 a.m. on Monday that he would be representing the Venezuelan president in court. Shortly before the noon court hearing, he said he still hadn't spoken to Pollack, who ultimately represented Maduro in the proceeding.\n\nFlores is represented by Mark Donnelly, a Texas-based attorney who served as a federal prosecutor for 12 years, and one of his law partners, Andres Sanchez.\n\nPollack, a former public defender and president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, has a long track record of successful defense outcomes in criminal trials.\n\nHe represented former Enron accountant Michael W. Krautz, who a jury acquitted of fraud charges. And he successfully overturned the conviction of Martin Tankleff, a Long Island man who spent 17 years in prison after he was falsely accused of killing his parents as a teenager.\n\nMore recently, Pollack represented the executive of a poultry company accused of conspiring to fix the price of chickens. Jurors declined to find the executive guilty in two separate trials.\n\nIn a 2025 interview with Lawdragon, Pollack decried the Justice Department's \"extraordinary view\" of its jurisdiction for criminal cases, using the Assange case as an example.\n\n\"You've got somebody who's not a United States citizen who is publishing information not in the United States, had not set foot in the United States, with respect to any of the alleged offensive conduct,\" Pollack said. \"The information was leaked to him by somebody in Iraq. Yet the United States obviously felt that it could pursue that as a criminal offense in the United States.\"",

    "fullText": "Children are growing up as AI natives and experts say computing skills should be on par with reading and writing\n\nIn a Cambridge classroom, Joseph, 10, trained his AI model to discern between drawings of apples and drawings of smiles.\n\n“AI gets lots of things wrong,” he said, as it mistakenly identified a fruit as a face. He set about retraining it and, in a flash, he had it back on track – instinctively understanding the inner nature of artificial intelligence and machine learning in a way few adults do.\n\nHis friends from the St Paul’s C of E primary school coding club tapped away to build their own AIs with similar dexterity. Just as people born in the early 20th century never knew a world without manned flight, and generation Z has always lived with social media, Joseph and his friends are AI natives.\n\nHere, on one December morning, some of them were being taught the principles and practicalities of the potentially world-changing technology that experts fear may pass large numbers of people by and leave them disempowered.\n\nPhilip Colligan, the chief executive of the digital education charity the Raspberry Pi Foundation, has warned of a “big split” in society between people who grasp how AIs work and are able to control them – challenging their increasing role in automating decisions in areas including housing, welfare, health, criminal justice and finance. On the other hand, there could be a cadre of AI illiterates who risk social disempowerment.\n\nColligan, a leading expert in technology and its social impacts, told the Guardian AI literacy must become a universal part of education on a par with reading and writing to avoid a social divide opening up.\n\n“There is a world where you’ve got a big split between kids who understand, have that core knowledge and therefore are able to assert themselves and those who don’t,” said Colligan, whose charity is affiliated to the £600m British low-cost tech hardware startup of the same name. “And that could be really very dangerous.”\n\nHis warning was backed by Simon Peyton Jones, a computer researcher who led the creation of the schools national curriculum for computing in 2014, prior to the AI boom. He called for a new digital literacy qualification for all schoolchildren that would ensure they know how to use AIs in a critical way.\n\n“If it’s simply a black box, then [its actions] seem like magic,” he said. “If you know nothing about how the magic is working that is terribly disabling. I am very worried about students leaving school without having agency in the world.”\n\nTheir comments came amid a fall in the number of children studying computing, with 2025 entries for a GCSE in the subject down across the UK. Today, three times more people take history and nearly double the number take biology, chemistry and physics. At the same time, use of AI systems nationwide has been surging – up 78% in the year to September, according to polling by Ipsos.\n\nPart of the belief that learning computing skills is becoming redundant comes from some of the big AI companies, which argue their systems are going to automate coding. Anthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, said in October that 90% of its own coding was automated using its Claude AI model. Meanwhile, 2025 was the year when “vibe coding” became a common phrase – capturing the idea that AIs would allow humans to build software by using natural language instructions rather than specialised code.\n\nPolitical leaders such as Keir Starmer have also suggested coding is becoming redundant. As leader of the opposition in 2023, he said: “The old way – learning out-of-date IT, on 20-year-old computers – doesn’t work. But neither does the new fashion, that every kid should be a coder, when artificial intelligence will blow that future away.” It has created the idea that understanding the inner workings of a computer may be less relevant in the future.\n\n“I think they’re just overhyping the benefits,” said Colligan, whose charity works in schools across dozens of countries.\n\n“This message is leaking out that the kids don’t need to learn this stuff any more and that is not only flawed it is dangerous. We’re already talking to teachers in lots and lots of schools around the world, not just the UK, saying: ‘We can drop computer science now, right?’ That’s a problem.”\n\nHe added: “All of us are going into a world where more and more of the decisions we encounter every day will be taken by automated systems. At the moment it’s what movie should I watch next or what song should I listen to? Fairly soon it’s going to be finance decisions, healthcare decisions, criminal justice decisions. If you don’t understand how those decisions are being made by automated systems, you can’t advocate for your rights. You can’t challenge them, you can’t critically evaluate what’s being presented to you.”\n\nIn December, the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who is now an AI investor, predicted that “we will move from staring at the internet, to living in the internet”.\n\nColligan said: “My concern is there will be a gap between kids based on their socioeconomic background. Some kids who go to great schools, who are able to teach this stuff, will be in a much stronger position as citizens, whether or not they’re using technology for their job. Those kids who are in communities where they don’t have access to [AI literacy teaching] will be passively on the end of a whole load of automated decisions.”\n\nIn the coding club, the seven- to 10-year-olds are taught how AIs work. The lessons were clearly having an effect on Joseph. He said he thought AI “will probably be good, but if lots of people believe it when it’s wrong it will have a bad impact on them”.\n\nHe was not interested in letting the AI do the coding of the video games he planned to make. “It might do it differently to what you want,” he said. “It might also do it wrong and you need to know how to solve it … I’d like to be in charge of the AI. If the AI is in charge of us, we wouldn’t really be able to control what we’re doing and that would be bad.”",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS — Nvidia (NVDA) is touting its latest robotics advancements at CES 2026 as the broader tech industry begins a large-scale effort to bring humanoid robots to life.\n\nDuring the company's keynote on Monday, CEO Jensen Huang revealed that firms ranging from Boston Dynamics and Caterpillar (CAT) to LG Electronics and NEURA Robotics are using Nvidia's robotics technologies to develop and power their various bots.\n\nNvidia has claimed that physical AI could revolutionize the $50 trillion manufacturing and logistics industries, and the company wants to be at the center of it all.\n\nDuring CES, Nvidia revealed a variety of new AI models to help train robots to interact with the world around them, as well as the hardware necessary to power their digital brains.\n\nIn addition to humanoid bots, Nvidia showed off a new family of models for self-driving cars called Alpamayo. According to the company, Alpamayo uses a chain-of-thought reasoning-based vision language action (VLA) model.\n\nThat's a lot to take in, but essentially the models can recognize unique driving situations that might not otherwise happen during a regular drive and come up with the proper way to move forward.\n\nFor instance, the model could see that a traffic light is out when a vehicle is approaching an intersection, recognize the problem, and try to figure out what to do next.\n\nNvidia said the models are meant to serve as \"large-scale teacher models that developers can fine-tune and distill into the backbones of their complete [self-driving] stacks.\"\n\nIn other words, Alpamayo is meant to help developers improve their self-driving vehicle technologies over time.\n\nNvidia said companies including Lucid (LCID), Uber (UBER), and Berkeley DeepDrive have shown interest in Alpamayo.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles are hitting roads around the world, with Google's Waymo leading the way, but they're still not perfect. Some cars have caused traffic jams and have gotten confused in certain situations.\n\nNvidia sees virtual training as a helpful solution for the continued development of the technology, allowing developers to teach their AI models without having to necessarily put cars on the road at all times.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

    "title": "There’s Compelling Evidence That Someone Connected to the Trump Administration Profited Off the Invasion of Venezuela by Placing Large Bets on Polymarket",
    "description": "\"Pete Hegseth making some beer money on the side?\"",
    "fullText": "Prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi have long garnered a reputation for facilitating cheating and insider trading — allowing an athlete, for instance, to place a bet on a game they could then lose on purpose.\n\nNow there’s compelling evidence that someone with inside information about the Trump administration’s regime change plans in Venezuela used that foreknowledge to profit massively from the conflict.\n\nAs spotted by researcher Tyson Brody, an unidentified user bet tens of thousands of dollars on various predictions that Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro would be imminently “out” or that the US forces would show up “in Venezuela by” a specified date during the runup to the incursion.\n\nThe account “existed for only one week and quickly became the biggest ‘yes’ holder in the Maduro out market,” Brody tweeted.\n\nThe evidence of insider trading is compelling, to say the least, given the highly suspicious timing. The account invested over $30,000 less than two days before the United States launched its invasion to kidnap Maduro and his wife and “profited $400,000 in less than 24 hours,” as sports entrepreneur Joe Pompliano calculated in a post on Bluesky.\n\n“Seems pretty suspicious!” he added. “[Secretary of defense] Pete Hegseth making some beer money on the side?” Brody joked.\n\n“Insider trading is not only allowed on prediction markets; it’s encouraged,” Pompliano argued.\n\nWho was behind the Polymarket account remains a mystery. Accounts on markets like Polymarket are anonymous, and payouts are in cryptocurrency, making them hard to track.\n\nAs Semafor reported over the weekend, news organizations also had early intel of the US raid on Venezuela, but held off publishing the information so as not to put US troops in danger.\n\nIn other words, could it have been an insider at a New York or Washington newsroom who was trying to make a buck — or was it an operative inside the Trump administration?\n\nPrediction markets have long raised concerns over exactly these types of situations. Case in point, one Polymarket user made $1 million in 24 hours in early December after betting on Google’s 2025 Year in Search rankings. Per Forbes, the account had a “near-perfect record of 22 correct predictions out of 23 attempts.”\n\nAs The American Prospect points out, critics of the Trump administration have long accused officials of dabbling in similar behavior. The administration has also allowed the prediction market to flourish by dropping enforcement cases in the crypto world and failing to introduce meaningful regulations.\n\nEven Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), which owns the president’s social network, Truth Social, entered the prediction markets business last year, showing a pointed appetite for the space.\n\n“Of course insiders shouldn’t be able to get rich off of policy decisions — but even more concerning is the possibility that people are skewing policy outcomes in order to make their bets pay off,” Demand Progress executive director Sean Vitka told The American Prospect.\n\nOne thing’s for sure: while insiders profit, those without that privileged information lose out — and when the bets are on a deadly conflict, innocent people stand to suffer as well.\n\n“And questions related to whether or not, and when, military action might be undertaken are especially vulnerable to such manipulation because the president frequently moves with discretion over the timing and (legally or not) without notice to the public or Congress,” Vitka added.\n\nMore on Polymarket: New App Lets Users Bet on Deadly Conflicts in Real Time",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump is fretting that the Supreme Court will shoot down his signature tariffs initiative and declare it illegal.\n\nIn a panicked Truth Social post, the 79-year-old pushed the false claim that his tariffs generated $600 billion for the U.S. while suggesting there is a media blackout on their dubious benefits.\n\n“We have taken in, and will soon be receiving, more than 600 Billion Dollars in Tariffs, but the Fake News Media refuses to talk about it because they hate and disrespect our Country, and want to interfere with the upcoming Tariff decision, one of the most important ever, of the United States Supreme Court,” Trump wrote. “Because of Tariffs, our Country is financially, AND FROM A NATIONAL SECURITY STANDPOINT, FAR STRONGER AND MORE RESPECTED THAN EVER BEFORE. GOD BLESS AMERICA!”\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule in the coming weeks on whether to overturn a previous ruling that declared most of Trump’s sweeping global tariffs illegal.\n\nA lower federal appeals court found in August that the president had overstepped his authority when he cited a 1977 law—the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which is designed to address threats during a national emergency—to justify his reciprocal tariffs.\n\nWhile the conservative-majority Supreme Court, including three justices nominated by Trump, has largely ruled in the president’s favor in past cases, there are growing indications that the court may not back him this time and could strike down the tariffs.\n\nDuring a hearing in November, Trump-appointed Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts, appeared skeptical of the president’s reasoning for imposing the tariffs.\n\nIf SCOTUS were to rule against Trump, it would not only be a major embarrassment for the president but could also trigger further economic turmoil, as countries may need to be reimbursed for the billions of dollars of funds collected under Trump’s tariff plans.\n\nTrump has posted multiple fear-mongering messages on Truth Social since the Supreme Court began hearing arguments in the case last year.\n\n“The U.S. Supreme Court was given the wrong numbers. The ‘unwind’ in the event of a negative decision on Tariffs would be, including investments made, to be made, and return of funds, in excess of 3 Trillion Dollars,” Trump wrote in a late-night November post. “It would not be possible to ever make up for that kind of a ‘drubbing.’”\n\nIn another desperate message on January 2, Trump added: “Tariffs are an overwhelming benefit to our Nation, as they have been incredible for our National Security and Prosperity (like nobody has ever seen before!). Losing our ability to Tariff other countries who treat us unfairly would be a terrible blow to the United States of America.”",

    "fullText": "The bodies of Alain Noël, 56, and Christine Sauvé, 55, of Québec, were found by their son at the couple’s vacation home in the Dominican Republic on Dec. 26\n\nHer brother tells PEOPLE that the couple hadn't been feeling well before their deaths and seemed \"exhausted\" when they last spoke the following day\n\nA married couple from Canada were found dead while vacationing in the Dominican Republic last month. As family members await answers about what happened, they're speaking out about the couple's final moments.\n\nChristine Sauvé, 55, and Alain Noël, 56, both of Québec, were found dead by their son in their vacation home located in the El Indio Village residential complex in Villa Riva on Friday, Dec. 26, her brother, Gilles Sauvé Jr., confirms to PEOPLE.\n\nAutopsies have already been performed and Gilles says the family's been told they can expect initial results later this week, but that a final report could take up to 4 months.\n\nWithout any definitive answers just yet, there's been lots of speculation in the local press, including questions about whether the couple were murdered or died by suicide. But, Gilles believes \"that is not true.\"\n\nChristine and Alain were married for over 30 years and raised two kids — Jonathan, 30, and Sabrina, 28 — Gilles says, describing the couple as good people with lots of friends.\n\n\"Alain was a big man but a really big teddy bear. And Christine was amazing,\" her brother says. \"She liked to do a lot of things for the family.”\n\nChristine and Alain arrived in the Dominican Republic — where they got a house they planned to live in after retiring — along with their son Jonathan on Dec. 14 for the start of a month-long vacation.\n\nWhile overseas, Gilles says that Christine began experiencing dizziness and had a fall, which prompted her to go to a hospital on Dec. 25, where she had her blood work done. When she went home later that day, she was not given any prescription for her symptoms, but was told to come back the following day for some scans.\n\nGilles says that Alain had also experienced a little dizziness, but was so caught up in worry about his wife's health that he didn't end up mentioning it to doctors.\n\nAfter coming back from the hospital, the couple FaceTimed their family back in Canada. Gilles says they both appeared to be a \"little bit exhausted,\" but didn't report feeling dizzy at the time.\n\nDuring the conversation, Christine mentioned having no clue what caused the dizziness. She wondered if it might have anything to do with her ongoing health issues — they both had high blood pressure and diabetes — although she couldn't say for sure.\n\n\"It was not clear,\" Gilles says. \"There was nothing really clear about it.\"\n\nAdditionally, they both mentioned having a bit of a \"stomach problem,\" but didn't think they'd eaten any food that upset them.\n\nMostly, they were \"very tired and exhausted,\" but otherwise fine during the call, according to Gilles.\n\n\"Alain showed me his house outside because he did some new little garden things and put lights on and,\" he says, adding that his sister was also \"looking and talking\" well.\n\nThe next morning, when Jonathan woke up around 9:30 a.m., he noticed his parents hadn’t gotten up yet, which was odd because Alain, who worked in the family construction business, was usually an early riser.\n\nGilles says Jonathan brushed it off at the time, thinking they'd slept in because they'd been so tired the night before. However, when they still hadn't woken up an hour later, he went into their room and found them unresponsive in bed.\n\nThe first thing that Jonathan did, says Gilles, was call his sister Sabrina and tell her that their parents were not breathing. Sabrina then told her brother to call the resort manager-owner, who proceeded to contact local authorities.\n\n“Everybody came and they did what they had to do and they searched the house,” Gilles says.\n\nGilles and Sabrina arrived in the Dominican Republic about a day and a half later to be with Jonathan and help communicate with Dominican authorities, which have been difficult due to the language barrier.\n\nCanadian officials reached out to the family four days later to give them the phone number of the funeral home, which they'd already reached out to.\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada previously confirmed their deaths to Global News, saying they were in contact with local authorities \"to gather more information\" amid the ongoing investigation, but were not able to release any further information due to privacy considerations.\n\nNeither the Dominican National Police, the National Institute of Forensic Sciences, the Attorney General’s Office in the Dominican Republic nor Global Affairs Canada responded to PEOPLE's request for additional comment.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nMore than a week after the tragedy, Gilles says the family is doing okay, but the deaths of their loved ones have been hard to process.\n\n“It's a big loss,\" he says, noting that losing them both at the same time has made everything harder, especially for their kids.\n\nAs for how he wants Alain and Christine to be remembered, her brother says it's for their legacy of kindness.\n\nSharing an example, Gilles says that when his wife died a year and a half ago from leukemia, his sister stepped up to help take care of his daughter, who also works in the family business. Now, in the wake of his sister's death, he says he'll do whatever he can to be there for her kids.\n\nGilles adds, \"I have two kids, but now I have four kids because I will take care of theirs.”",

    "fullText": "U.S. multinational corporations will be exempted from paying more corporate taxes overseas in a deal finalized by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nThe OECD announced Monday that nearly 150 countries have agreed on the plan, initially crafted in 2021, to stop large global companies from shifting profits to low-tax countries, no matter where they operate in the world.\n\nThe amended version excludes large U.S.-based multinational corporations from the 15% global minimum tax after negotiations between President Donald Trump’s administration and other members of the Group of Seven wealthy nations.\n\nOECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said in a statement that the agreement is a “landmark decision in international tax co-operation” and “enhances tax certainty, reduces complexity, and protects tax bases.”\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the agreement “a historic victory in preserving U.S. sovereignty and protecting American workers and businesses from extraterritorial overreach.”\n\nThe most recent version of the deal waters down a landmark 2021 agreement that set a minimum global corporate tax of 15%. The idea was to stop multinational corporations, including Apple and Nike, from using accounting and legal maneuvers to shift earnings to low- or no-tax havens.\n\nThose havens are typically places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, where the companies actually do little or no business.\n\nFormer Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was a key driver of the 2021 OECD global tax deal and made the corporate minimum tax one of her top priorities. The plan was widely panned by congressional Republicans who said it would make the U.S. less competitive in a global economy.\n\nThe Trump administration in June re-negotiated the deal when congressional Republicans rolled back a so-called revenge tax provision from Trump’s big tax and spending bill that would have allowed the federal government to impose taxes on companies with foreign owners, as well as on investors from countries judged as charging “unfair foreign taxes” on U.S. companies.\n\nTax transparency groups have criticized the amended OECD plan.\n\n“This deal risks nearly a decade of global progress on corporate taxation only to allow the largest, most profitable American companies to keep parking profits in tax havens,” said Zorka Milin, policy director at the FACT Coalition, a tax transparency nonprofit.\n\nTax watchdogs argue the minimum tax is supposed to halt an international race to the bottom for corporate taxation that has led multinational businesses to book their profits in countries with low tax rates.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Hisense Just Announced the RGB MiniLED Evo",
    "description": "The company also revealed that Xbox Cloud Gaming is coming to its TVs.",
    "fullText": "Hisense is all about TVs at this year's CES—specifically, how those TVs display color. If the company's keynote is any indication, Hisense is extremely invested in leading the charge in color reproduction. Though its tagline this year is \"Innovating a Brighter Life,\" the pitch is less on how bright their TVs are, and more on how true to life their colors are, especially when it comes to accurately displaying the filmmakers' original intent. Will consumers buy a TV because their favorite movie looks a bit more how the director intended it to be? I'm not sure. But that's largely the idea behind Hisense's new RGB MiniLED Evo.\n\nHisense's biggest announcement of the day is its RGB MiniLED Evo. This iteration of the company's RGB MiniLED technology comes with three key upgrades: First, there's the \"Chromagic\" precision backlight. The company says this technology helps avoid color bleeding and tint shifting when watching content. It also boosts the colors offered by existing RGB MiniLED technology: Hisense says this new standard can display 110% of the BT.2020 color gamut with four-primary colors (red, green, blue, and sky blue, or cyan), while RGB MiniLED can achieve 100% BT.2020 with the standard three primary colors. The company says Evo also comes with AI-powered RGB color dimming with \"134 bit precision.\"\n\nSecond, RGB MiniLED Evo has a \"Hi-View AI engine,\" to sync color across the TV's backlight. This engine comes with a three-core RISC CPU and a 2TOPS NPU for AI processing. Hisense claims the chip provides a 40% boost in computing performance, a 70% improvement in scenario recognition computing power, and 100% upgrade in scenario adaption computing capability. The company says the RGB MiniLED Evo can help display shows and movies as the original creators intended them to look. Hisense compared it to OLED, which it says displays content with too little brightness, and QD MiniLED, which it says compromises the color by being too bright.\n\nHisense's RGB MiniLED—not necessarily just Evo—also supposedly cuts down on blue light. Hisense says its new display tech emits 60% \"less harmful\" blue light than QD OLED, though the science doesn't necessarily support the claims that blue light is any worse for you than other light colors. The company also says RGB MiniLED is 30% more energy-efficient than QD OLED, though it didn't include any references to back up those claims in the keynote. Finally, Evo comes with an AI calibration feature, which Hisense touts as a way for users to turn their TVs into professional reference monitors.\n\nThe company says RGB MiniLED evo is coming to its product lineup, including the U8, UX, U9, and U7 series, this year.\n\nWhile the RGB MiniLED Evo was undoubtedly Hisense's biggest announcement this year, the company also ran through some other news at the keynote. First, there's the XR10, a new projector that can reach up to 300 inches. It comes with liquid cooling, lens shift supporting a 4K projection, and 6,000 lumens of brightness.\n\nThe company also announced the MXS MicroLED TV, which can scale up to 163 inches. Despite devoting only a moment to the TV, company says the MXS won an CES 2026 Innovation Award. Hisense also made some announcements about its TV OS, including features like weather, calendar, and integrations with other smart home devices. But perhaps most notably, Hisense announced a partnership with Microsoft to bring both Copilot and Xbox Cloud Gaming to its TVs. That's pretty big news.\n\nFinally, if you're both a Hisense and a FIFA fan, you can buy products from the \"Hisense Elite Collection,\" which are designed specifically for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. I'm not sure how big that crossover is, nor do I think I'd buy a TV because it was made for one soccer event, but it was part of Hisense's announcement.",

    "fullText": "Your phone is a one-stop shop for a lot of your personal information, from day-to-day activities logged in your calendar and email to financial data accessed via banking apps. If you let someone else use your device—whether you're showing a friend a collection of photos or allowing a stranger to make an emergency call—there's a lot you don't want them to be able to see.\n\nIf you're an iPhone user, there are several features you can enable to prevent others from snooping around your device.\n\nIf you don't want someone using your device to see anything else on it, you can turn on Guided Access, which limits them to a single app (such as Phone or Photos). This essentially locks down your screen and prevents navigation outside of the specific features you make available.\n\nFirst, go to Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access and toggle the feature on. Tap Passcode Settings to set up a specific passcode or flip the Face ID toggle to use biometrics to end Guided Access sessions.\n\nTo start a Guided Access session before handing over your phone, open the app and triple click the side button. You can circle specific areas of the screen you don't want to respond to touch (such as swipes through Photos). Tap Session Settings at the bottom to set a time limit, disable the keyboard, and manage button press options. Then tap Start.\n\nTo end a Guided Access session, triple-click the side button and enter your passcode or double-click and authenticate with Face ID.\n\nSome mobile apps, like financial apps and password managers, already require you to log in or authenticate with your username and password combo or device biometrics every time you open them. You can also lock down other individual apps on iPhone so Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode is required for access. To lock an app from your home screen, touch and hold the icon until the quick actions menu appears, then tap Require Face ID.\n\nAlternatively, you can hide apps so others cannot see them on your device (let alone open them) unless you authenticate using Face ID, Touch ID or a passcode. To hide an app, tap and hold the icon on the home screen and tap Require Face ID in the quick actions menu. Tap Hide and Require Face ID > Hide App. If you need to open a hidden app, swipe left on your home screen to reach your App Library, locate the Hidden folder at the bottom, and tap and authenticate to unlock the folder followed by the app.\n\n(Note that some native iOS apps, including Calculator, Camera, Clock, Contacts, Find My, Maps, Shortcuts, and Settings, cannot be locked, and system apps that come preinstalled cannot be hidden.)",

    "fullText": "A father suffered serious head injuries during a brawl that broke out in the queue for a popular ride at Disneyland over the winter break.\n\nThe fight occurred last Tuesday afternoon in line for the Indiana Jones Adventure, one of the marquee dark rides at the Anaheim theme park, police and Disneyland officials confirmed.\n\n“A group of people were waiting in line at Indiana Jones when another group cut through the line to catch up with other family members,” Anaheim Police Sgt. Matt Sutter told KTLA.\n\nThe confrontation escalated into a roughly 30-second fight between two men, shocking parkgoers, including many children. Witnesses said the man whose family cut into the line brutally beat the other, who was visiting the park from Washington state with his family.\n\n“There were several people intervening to stop the guy,” wrote Reddit user ImaginaryBag. “He managed to get some hits in even with people blocking. Then he stepped back a bit so others did too. That’s when he jumped in for one last sucker punch, which drew blood, and then he ran off with his family following.”\n\nPolice confirmed the suspect fled Disneyland and remained at large as of Monday morning. Sutter said investigators have strong leads on his identity and believe he is a Southern California resident.\n\n“There are two sides to every story, so we need to hear from him (and) what happened from his point of view,” Sutter told KTLA’s Sara Welch.\n\nThe victim, whose name was not released, was treated by Disneyland’s first aid staff for injuries including a large gash on his face that required stitches.\n\n“He refused to hit back (which took a lot of discipline) because he didn’t want the rest of the family to get kicked out or us blacklisted,” wrote Reddit user Wittwitbarista, who said the victim is her husband.\n\nDespite the ordeal, the family stayed at the park for the rest of the day.\n\n“Hubby had no concussion, stitches, okay honestly … Disney Security, nurses and (cast members) were all so magically wonderful,” Wittwitbarista wrote.\n\nThis was the second incident that same day involving an Indiana Jones attraction at a Disney park. A 400-pound inflatable boulder prop rolled off its track during the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular at Disney’s Hollywood Studios, injuring a park employee who stepped in front of it to keep it from bouncing into the crowd.",

    "fullText": "Jan 5 (Reuters) - Intel launched Panther Lake, its new AI chip for laptops, on Monday at the CES trade show in Las Vegas, as the company seeks to ​reassure investors about the first product made using its next-generation manufacturing process called 18A.\n\nJim Johnson, ‌senior vice president and general manager of Intel's PC group, offered technical details about the company's first line of Panther Lake chips known ‌as Intel Core Ultra Series 3. The chips feature a new transistor design and a way to deliver power to the chip due to the company's 18A manufacturing process.\n\nAt the event, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company made good on its promise to ship its first products with the 18A manufacturing process in 2025, referring to ⁠the Panther Lake chips.\n\nIntel's prior-generation Lunar ‌Lake chips were largely made by TSMC. The stakes for Intel are high - the company is making its first high-volume product with 18A, and hopes to reclaim market share ‍it has lost to Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nJohnson said the company has created a separate graphics chiplet - a mini chip stitched together with other mini-chips to form a complete processor. On Monday, Intel said the Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips ​would deliver 60% better performance than the prior-generation Lunar Lake Series 2.\n\nIntel plans to launch a platform ‌for handheld video games based on the Panther Lake designs this year, Johnson said. Handheld PCs designed by a range of suppliers have grown in popularity in recent years.\n\nIntel has struggled with the yield, or the number of good chips per silicon wafer, for the Panther Lake processors, Reuters reported last year. Intel executives have said its yields are improving monthly and will pave the way for the launch this year.\n\nFor its part, ⁠AMD plans to give a CES keynote address at 9:30 p.m. ​EST on Monday  (0230 GMT on Tuesday). CEO Lisa Su will ​likely launch new generations of PC chips that are geared for AI and graphics.\n\nAMD announced a multibillion-dollar deal with OpenAI for its next-generation MI400 chips, some of which the companies ‍plan to deploy this year. ⁠The deal with the ChatGPT maker is expected to generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue for the chip designer.\n\nThe CEO of AI chip leader Nvidia, Jensen Huang, also spoke at CES ⁠on Monday. He said the company’s next generation of chips was in “full production,” and they could deliver five times the artificial-intelligence computing ‌of the company’s previous chips when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Petkit's Yumshare Daily Feast Is an Automatic Wet Food Feeder for Your Cat",
    "description": "The Yumshare can automatically dispense wet food for up to one week.",
    "fullText": "I don't have a cat, but I do have a dog, and my dog can be a picky eater. After months of trial and error, the only way we could get him to consistently eat breakfast and dinner was with wet food. There is no scenario in which I or someone watching my dog can outsource the task of feeding him, but that's not the case for cat owners. I know that cats sometimes stay home alone for extended periods of time, where an automatic food dispenser becomes essential. I can only imagine, then, that cat owners who, like me, feed their pet wet food, now have a challenge: Someone has to be there to feed the cat.\n\nThat's what intrigues me about Petkit's Yumshare Daily Feast, an automated cat feeder that specifically works with wet food. I covered the Yumshare briefly when Petkit first announced it last week, but I got some hands-on time with the product today on the CES show floor. And while the device I saw isn't going to market just yet, I was intrigued.\n\nThe concept itself is pretty simple, but a bit more complex in execution. As you might expect, the feeder distributes portions of food for your cat to eat when you're not available—only here, that food is wet, not dry. To achieve this, Petkit outfitted the Yumshare with a chamber that can hold up to seven pouches of wet food at once. These pouches are designed for the Yumshare alone: Right now, the only company making pouches is Food Chain, which uses Petkit's proprietary design to fit the Yumshare, but it's possible more companies more jump on board in the future.\n\nWhen the Yumshare first opens one of these pouches, it sets a timer: After 48 hours, the pouch is discarded. In the meantime, the machine can automatically dole out portions set by the user, into a cup, which is stored in a separate chamber in the device. Once the portion is distributed, the pouch is sealed until the next portion is needed. The machine also uses UVC ultraviolet light to sanitize the package, with the goal of eliminating bacteria.\n\nThe automation extends to the portion of wet food itself, as well. Whether your cat eats all of the food, some of the food, or none of the food, the Yumshare can discard what's left when it detects it's time to do so. That might be the AI camera identifying that the food has dried up, or an internal clock recognizing that too much time has passed for the food to be safe to eat. Either way, the food drops into a waste compartment, which can hold up to 15 cups at once. The stand remains empty until it's time to hand out another portion of food.\n\nHow large or small each portion is, as well as how often portions are distributed, is up to you. Petkit showed me a mockup of the Yumshare's app, which lets you customize this feeding schedule. The app will also tell you how many portions have been distributed, and how many are left in the chamber. You can also take a look at a live video feed of your cat, via the 4K camera embedded in the device, or view a clip history of your cat's feeding habits.\n\nMy only question is the lack of refrigeration: Petkit says that there is no need for it, since the pouches are all sealed until use, closed in between portions, and the chamber uses ultraviolet light to sterilize for bacteria. But I'd want to confirm there are no health risks to keeping an opened pouch unrefrigerated for up to two full days, even with that UVC light. Assuming that's true, I'm quite impressed with this prototype. If I were a cat owner that frequently needed to leave my pet alone at breakfast and dinner, this is something I'd have my eye on.",

    "description": "The ROG Zephyrus Duo is back for 2026, with two full-sized screens.",
    "fullText": "CES is the time of year for weird computers, and Asus is bringing back an old fan favorite to help fill its unusual form factor quota. Gamers who miss the days of dual screens, get excited: the ROG Zephyrus Duo is returning for 2026, and it's bigger than ever.\n\nLooking a bit like a gigantic Nintendo DS, the new ROG Zephyrus Duo stacks two full-sized 3K OLED screens on top of each other, with a standard laptop hinge in between. It's a lot like the company's existing Zenbook Duo, but that one's geared more for productivity users—the Zephyrus Duo is fully specced out for gamers, with a 120Hz refresh rate on both screens, the latest Intel Core Ultra chips, up to an RTX 5090 laptop GPU, up to 64GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage. Plus, it supports 250W fast charging and can play games using up to 125W of power.\n\nThat's plenty for even the most demanding games, although its price is still an unknown for now. What we do know is how different this is from the last Zephyrus Duo, which came out in 2023. That laptop's lower screen was a simple small angled panel above the keyboard, instead of a full-sized display matching the upper one. It was great for displaying stats at a glance while playing, but not much else.\n\nInstead, the new Zephyrus Duo can display the same game across both screens, mirror them, or pull up reference material on one screen while you play on the other. It's also got a bunch of new ways you can use it: It comes with a detachable wireless keyboard, and you can either use it like a normal laptop with that keyboard covering one of the screens, or get creative.\n\nAn example photo from Asus show the laptop with one screen above the other, both screens in a side-to-side portrait mode, the whole laptop laid flat on a table (perhaps for head-to-head play), and tent mode. Tent mode is especially interesting—an Asus representative told journalists that gamers could play the same game against each other while sitting across from each other in tent mode, with each display acting as a private screen. He did acknowledge that this might impact performance and compatibility might differ based on game, but I could see it being an especially great option for, say, fighting games.\n\nAgain, this format has been used for non-gaming laptops before, but it's seemingly got a lot of potential for gamers, too. There's a reason one of Nintendo's most popular handhelds opted for a dual-screen setup. And hey, maybe you could even play some DS games made on this, too.\n\nThe new ROG Zephyrus Duo is expected to launch sometime in Q2 of this year.",

    "fullText": "With the rise of streaming culture, a lot of gamers have started investing in computers that don't just play games well, but that look good while doing it. Asus's newest pre-built gaming desktop, the ROG G1000, is pretty by-the-book when it comes to high-end performance, but it's got one major selling point when it comes to those all-important gamer aesthetics: holograms.\n\nBuilt into this computer's front panel and one of its side panels, safely tucked into inaccessible glass windows, are rapidly rotating LED strips that, when in motion, create convincing full-color images that appear to have depth. The \"frame rate\" can be a little low, but it's a known technology that's all over the show floor at every CES now, and you can actually buy generic standalone hologram fans on Amazon for around $60-$100. It's just rare to see it integrated into something like a PC.\n\nThis hologram tech, called AniMe Holo, should make for a great way to show off on camera (or to your buddies in a college dorm) and Asus is promising some pretty expansive customizability. You can put still images and gifs on it, sure, but Asus also told journalists it can support full videos or mp4 files, without any limit on length. I think I'd try to use it to watch Shrek.\n\nThe effect comes across a bit better in-person, but it's still unusual enough to look enticing over video, even if you lose some of the depth. Unfortunately, still photos aren't really a great way to show this thing off, since they can't depict the rotating motion.\n\nAesthetics aside, the G1000 is also at the top of the power game, coming with the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X 3D CPU, an RTX 5090 GPU, up to 128GB of RAM, and a 2TB storage. It's got bite to back up its bark, and will be able to play the latest games at max settings with no issue.\n\nOf course, specs like that are likely to cost you a pretty penny, especially with the hologram gimmick tossed on top of them. Asus hasn't tipped its hand on pricing yet, but the ROG G1000 is expected to launch sometime in Q2 of this year.",

Wizards of the Coast has begun to reveal cards from the upcoming set, with many shown off during a livestream today.\n\nThe first reveal of Lorwyn Eclipsed featured faces new and old from the Magic universe, including first-year Strixhaven student Abigale, and the mischievous elven sorcerer Oko. Multiple cards, mechanics, and treatments were shown off during the livestream, including the return of Anime Showcase treatments, as well as a mini bonus sheet of Special Guest reprints from Magic's past.\n\nThe reveal came coupled with a brief music video, One Light, One Dark: A Boggart Ballad. The short story featured two boggarts, one living in Lorwyn and the other in Shadowmoor, and both were represented by puppets created in partnership between Wizards of the Coast and the Jim Henson company.\n\nWe'll be updating this gallery with more cards from Lorwyn Eclipsed as they are revealed throughout the week, with the final previews slated for January 9.

I was more of the manager and dealing with players and everything.\n\n\"So I learned a lot from him from that point of view and then I think he's done a great job as a whole.\"",

I know who I am and where I come from.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'll fight every day to return stronger. I will rise again, better than ever.\"\n\nMeanwhile, City have recalled academy product Max Alleyne from his loan spell at Championship side Watford and he could be involved in the squad for Wednesday's Premier League game against Brighton.\n\nThe 20-year-old - son of former England cricketer and current Gloucestershire head coach Mark Alleyne - made 17 appearances for the Hornets after joining on a season's loan.\n\nBut with England centre-back John Stones also currently sidelined, that deal has been cut short as Pep Guardiola's side, who are exploring a January move for Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi, try to tackle their growing injury crisis in defence.",

    "description": "There is \"no apparent big picture view at Celtic\", argues BBC Sport Scotland's Tom English as Wilfried Nancy and Paul Tisdale exit the ailing champions.",
    "fullText": "On days like this, when a manager falls, the immediate reaction is to think about where it all went wrong, the timeline of doom, the moments where the writing started appearing on the wall.\n\nWith Wilfried Nancy, there's no need for any of that because it was never right in the first place. There were no turning points in this saga, no twists in the plot.\n\nNancy's appointment was one of the greatest blunders Celtic have made in their history. A relative rookie on a bad run with Columbus Crew - they finished seventh in Major League Soccer - it was a punt based on little more than the hipster vibes of Paul Tisdale, the now former head of football operations.\n\nTisdale didn't open his mouth to fans or media in his brief time in a powerful position at Celtic Park, but he did a whole lot of damage. If Nancy ranks extremely highly in the club's most calamitous calls then Tisdale is on a par or, perhaps even, slightly ahead of him given that it was the self-styled 'Doctor Football' who championed Nancy to the club's board.\n\nNancy never got out of the blocks, his two wins from eight games coming in a flawed victory over bottom-of-the-table Livingston and a triumph over 10-man Aberdeen, who have also just sacked their manager.\n\nAll memory of Nancy's reign - if you want to call it that - will be shovelled under a carpet now by anybody and everybody culpable in the process of appointing him. If they're all true to recent form, none of them will speak, none will apologise, none will show humility by accepting that they got this woefully wrong.\n\nThe fans will have to make-do with a short written statement. Let them eat cake, in other words.\n\nNancy's laidback arrival - spending just 15 minutes talking with Martin O'Neill before ripping up everything O'Neill had done to stabilise things - was in stark contrast to the unceremonious manner of his exit. O'Neill, as interim, was there longer than Nancy.",

They must take risks and have the courage to play attacking, aggressive football.\n\n\"United have got to a point where they need a manager who fits the DNA of the football club.\n\n\"Barcelona will never change for anybody. I don't believe United should change for anybody. The club has to find a manager who has got experience and who's willing to play fast entertaining, attacking and aggressive football.\"\n\nAmorim arrived at United with a clear tactical vision, favouring the 3-4-3 formation that had brought him success at Sporting, but United struggled to adapt.\n\n\"I thought they'd adapt better to the back three than they did,\" Neville said. \"I'm really stunned that they've continued to play so poorly in that system.\"\n\nSpeaking on The Rest Is Football podcast, former England striker Gary Lineker said: \"I think it was almost as though [Amorim] provoked it.\n\n\"It didn't seem to be the right fit and he was a bit stubborn about the way he wanted to play. The players didn't suit the way he plays and the club should have recognised that.\"",
