    "fullText": "Liverpool have given the fans a glimpse into the club's future. We're in an imperious position.\n\nThe signings of Alexander Isak, Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike in the summer, alongside the news that Dominik Szoboszlai, Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister are all set to be approach over a new contract, all combine to quite the spectacle over the next few years. All six are massive talents.\n\nAnd there's still a few daunting questions that fans will want to be answered when it comes to Virgil Van Dijk and Mohamed Salah's futures, alongside those of Ibrahima Konate and Andy Robertson beyond this season in particular, but the rumoured potential replacements are incredibly exciting.\n\nBut it's aside from all that where I'd like to concentrate. Giovanni Leoni's signing in the summer kind of went under the radar, and his ACL tear on debut won't have helped the lack of conversation around him, but he's an extraordinary talent. A recent transfer move that Liverpool completed suggests that me that Liverpool are going to be imperious in the future. It's that good a signing.\n\nEven though we've only had the chance to see 81 minutes of these two players combined, with Leoni getting just the one appearance and Ifeanyi Ndukwe's transfer only being confirmed on Friday night, it feels like something remarkable is brewing at Liverpool and I can't wait to see the pairing in action.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nIn the 19-year-old Italian, you've got a defender who Richard Hughes felt sufficiently impressed by to warrant a £26m plus add-ons approach, which is a serious transfer fee for a teenage centre-back.\n\nHis primary attributes are that he's 6ft 4ins, composed on the ball and and an incessant ball-winner; take the Southampton match as an example - he won four of his five duels, he made three interceptions, six clearances and three recoveries, alongside having a pass accuracy of 97%.\n\nThat's a player with a lot of potential, and while it might take him some time to recover from his ACL tear, he's actually showed a lot of promise in his limited time on the field. He's one half of the story.\n\nThe other is the Reds' new unconfirmed signing, 17-year-old Austrian centre-back Ndukwe. He'll move to Merseyside in the summer, as he'll have turned 18 by then and he'll spend some time working with the under-21s set-up before it's expected that the first-team will be calling for him.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about him, but in summary, he's incredibly tall like Leoni, and he also oozes composure on the ball, which is a trait that normally comes with maturity and experience.\n\nAnfield Watch's own Ben Bocsak has been effervescent over him in recent months, emphasising how big a talent he is, how high a ceiling he's got and what a brilliant signing he'd be for whoever got him.\n\nFabrizio Romano gave the 'Here We go' on his move to the Reds on Friday, and in a Youtube video on his channel, he revealed that Italian and German clubs were trying to secure him last season, only for him to choose to wait at Austria Vienna for a while longer. It turns out, Liverpool couldn't be ignored.\n\nAs a pairing, the 17-year-old and 19-year-old could be imperious for Liverpool in the next few years, and it's important that the timescale is emphasised here. Van Dijk and Konate will continue for the rest of this season, it's understood that Marc Guehi and at least one other defender will be signed in the next 12 months, and once everything's settled, then the two youngsters might get some chances.\n\nThat's all well and good, because you shouldn't rush young players' development, but when you see the potential they have, alongside other young talents such as Rio Ngumoha and Trey Nyoni, for example, it's difficult to not get carried away. The Reds' talent ID has always been really impressive, but the negotiation to convince these players to join Liverpool shouldn't get overlooked.\n\nIn signing Ndukwe, sporting director Richard Hughes has done exceptionally great work, and if he's able to realise his potential, alongside Leoni when he's recovered, then the club will have a glorious future. Others may come and go, but the youngsters being lined up right now are massive talents.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nA potential New York bidding war could be forming around Kyle Tucker, and if the market goes that way, the New York Yankees and New York Mets could find themselves battling it out.\n\nEarly predictions had Tucker in the $400 million range, but as the offseason has unfolded, that no longer feels safe to say, and that matters for two teams that are always willing to spend some money when it matters most.\n\nTucker is still viewed as one of the best players in baseball. He impacts the game on both sides of the baseball, can really swing it, and fits most lineups.\n\nFor the Yankees, he’d provide another middle-of-the-order presence with Aaron Judge. For the Mets, he’d represent another franchise bat to pair with Juan Soto.\n\nBoth New York teams have shown a willingness to spend, and both could use a player of his caliber after disappointing years a season ago.\n\nAccording to Jon Heyman, both squads have checked in on the left-handed hitting slugger.\n\n“Though he might not reach the early $400M predictions after his typically excellent but ultimately unsatisfying platform season with the Cubs, the all-around star (he, Mookie Betts, Aaron Judge, Juan Soto and José Ramírez are the only players to post a 4 WAR the past five seasons) should still be worth $300M-plus based on past deals and comps. But if he doesn’t mind resetting, the Dodgers could become an option for a short term and high AAV. The Yankees and Mets (and all big-market teams) have checked in, but Cody Bellinger’s versatility and lower price tag make him the New York mark — at least for now,” he wrote.\n\nIf Tucker’s asking price continues to come down, don’t be surprised if New York City turns into the center of his free-agency race.\n\nKyle Tucker now viewed as ‘fallback option’ for Yankees amid Cody Bellinger rumors\n\nAmid Jazz Chisholm rumors, Yankees predicted to sign Blue Jays’ Bo Bichette to $180 million contract\n\nRed Sox have shown interest in an All-Star the Yankees have been linked to in trade talks\n\nMariners reportedly willing to move top prospects for Yankees trade target, possibly take New York out of contention\n\nCubs predicted to make a deal for former Yankees dud and Blue Jays infielder who ruined World Series\n\nEx-Yankees fan favorite and top prospect linked to American League contender after hitting .318 last season",

    "fullText": "LSU football added a highly-touted defender to its transfer portal class on Tuesday. According to The Advocate's Wilson Alexander, the Tigers are signing former Boise State safety Ty Benefield.\n\nBenefield is one of the top safeties in the portal. Per 247Sports, Benefield is the No. 33-ranked player available. The On3 Transfer Portal Industry Rankings consider Benefield top-10 at his position.\n\nBenefield brings a wealth of experience to LSU's defense, playing over 2,000 snaps in three years at Boise State. In 2025, he made 80 tackles and recorded 30 stops to go along with two interceptions and three pressures. In his career, he's racked up 71 stops, five interceptions, two forced fumbles, 15 pressures, and three sacks.\n\nBenefield is versatile. LSU returns TaMarcus Cooley and Da'Shawn Spears at safety, but LSU DC Blake Baker likes to play three safeties in his dime package. We could see Benefield assume the STAR role if LSU opts to play a traditional defensive back in that position with Harold Perkins off to the NFL.\n\nLSU is signing Boise State transfer safety Ty Benefield, a source confirmed with @theadvocatebr. There's a lot of optimism about what he can bring to the secondary.\n\nMore: https://t.co/xHhyfUkji0 pic.twitter.com/2xCAFmEfzy\n\n— Wilson Alexander (@whalexander_) January 6, 2026\n\nBenefield stands at 6-foot-2 and has the physicality to play in the box along with the athleticism to run in coverage.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: LSU football signs veteran transfer portal safety",

    "fullText": "Jan. 6 (UPI) -- NASCAR commissioner Steve Phelps will resign at the end of January, he announced Tuesday.\n\nHis departure comes amid fallout from an antitrust lawsuit, which revealed disparaging messages he sent during revenue-sharing negotiations.\n\nPhelps, 63, joined NASCAR in 2005 as vice president of corporate marketing and later served as chief marketing officer, senior vice president, executive vice president, chief operating officer and president. He was promoted to commissioner in March.\n\n\"As a lifelong race fan, it gives me immense pride to have served as NASCAR's first commissioner and to lead our great sport through so many incredible challenges, opportunities and firsts over my 20 years,\" Phelps said in a news release. \"Our sport is built on the passion of our fans, the dedication of our teams and partners, and the commitment of our wonderful employees.\n\n\"It has been an honor to help synthesize the enthusiasm of long-standing NASCAR stakeholders with that of new entrants to our ecosystem, such as media partners, auto manufacturers, track operators and incredible racing talent.\n\nFront Row Motorsports and 23XI Racing, owned by basketball legend Michael Jordan and NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin, sued NASCAR in federal antitrust case.\n\nThe discovery process during that lawsuit revealed several disparaging remarks through message sent from Phelps, with the commissioner calling NASCAR legend and team owner Richard Childress a \"stupid redneck\" in once instance. Phelps apologized to Childress during the trial, but his remarks drew harsh criticism from those connected to the sport.\n\nNACAR reached a settlement with the teams in December.\n\nThe racing league did not announce additional leadership or personnel changes and said Phelps' departure \"comes during a time of stability with an exceptional leadership team in place.\"\n\n\"Steve will forever be remembered as one of NASCAR's most impactful leaders,\" NASCAR chairman and CEO Jim France said. \"For decades he has worked tirelessly to thrill fans, support teams and execute a vision for the sport that has treated us all to some of the greatest moments in our nearly 80-year history.\n\n\"It's been an honor to work alongside him in achieving the impossible like being the first sport to return during COVID or in delivering the unimaginable by launching new races in the LA Memorial Coliseum and NASCAR's first-ever street race in downtown Chicago. Steve leaves NASCAR with a transformative legacy of innovation and collaboration with an unrelenting growth mindset.\"\n\nThe 2026 NASCAR Cup Series season will start with the Cook Out Clash at Bowman Gray Stadium on Feb. 1 in Winston-Salem, N.C.

    "fullText": "Athletics pitcher Mason Miller throws to the Baltimore Orioles during the ninth inning of a baseball game Sunday, June 8, 2025, in West Sacramento, Calif. \n\nThe MLB team formerly known as the Oakland Athletics may not be able to call itself the Las Vegas Athletics when it moves to Sin City.\n\nThe A’s played their final season in Oakland in 2024. As they wait to finalize plans on a move to Vegas, the team has been using a Minor League field in Sacramento as their temporary home.\n\nShould the move to Vegas be completed, however, the team may have a different name. As pointed out by attorney Josh Gerben on his blog, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office denied multiple requests from the team, including for “Las Vegas Athletics” and “Vegas Athletics.” The trademarks were denied due to the names being deemed too generic.\n\nAccording to the USPTO, the dominant portion of each mark refers to a well-known geographic location (Las Vegas) while the remaining wording, ‘Athletics,’ lacks distinctiveness as applied to the goods and services identified in the applications.\n\nThe examining attorney noted that “athletics” is defined as “activities such as sports, exercises, and games that require physical skill and stamina,” and concluded that the term directly describes “the purpose and feature of the applicant’s goods and services.” As a result, the USPTO found that the marks merely describe a professional sports team located in Las Vegas rather than functioning as unique indicators of source.\n\nIn an effort to persuade the USPTO, the team pointed to decades of using the name “Athletics” throughout its history. The office, however, stood firm in its ruling.\n\nGerben added that he believes the Athletics will ultimately secure the trademark, noting that such an issue is rarely seen among professional sports teams.\n\nThe post The A’s Just Hit a Massive Speed Bump on Their Move to Las Vegas first appeared on Mediaite.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCleveland’s offseason begins with sweeping uncertainty after the organization dismissed head coach Kevin Stefanski following a five-win 2025 campaign.\n\nWhile general manager Andrew Berry will oversee the search for the franchise’s next head coach, the most pressing question centers on the quarterback position, which remains unresolved heading into 2026.\n\nBerry made clear the team is not locked into any one option under center. Rookie Shedeur Sanders closed the season as the starter, appearing in the final seven games, but the front office has stopped short of naming him the long-term answer.\n\nCleveland’s recent history suggests caution. The Browns have cycled through 13 starting quarterbacks during Stefanski’s tenure, including seven over the past two seasons alone, and the offense finished 31st in scoring at 16.4 points per game.\n\nSanders’ rookie year reflected both promise and struggle. He completed 56.6 percent of his passes for 1,400 yards with seven touchdowns and 10 interceptions across eight appearances.\n\nHe also added 169 rushing yards and a score. Despite a standout 364-yard, three-touchdown outing against Tennessee, Sanders posted a 19.0 Total QBR, ranking among the lowest marks recorded for quarterbacks with at least 200 pass attempts since 2006.\n\nBerry emphasized that no decision has been made, saying,\n\n“We’re going to do our work on the quarterback market… I can’t sit here and tell you whether the solution for the starter in 2026 is internal or external.” That evaluation will extend into the hiring of the next head coach, who Berry confirmed will have significant influence on the final call.\n\nCleveland’s options remain complicated by the presence of Deshaun Watson, whose contract continues to loom over roster planning.\n\nWatson missed the entire 2025 season while recovering from a second Achilles surgery after re-injuring the tendon in January.\n\nBerry said the team expects Watson to remain on the roster in 2026, noting his engagement during rehab and meetings, while also acknowledging the uncertainty ahead.\n\nBehind Sanders, Dillon Gabriel also remains under contract. The No. 94 pick started six straight games before a concussion sidelined him in Week 11, opening the door for Sanders.\n\nGabriel finished 1-5 as a starter, completing 59.5 percent of his throws for 937 yards with seven touchdowns and two interceptions. Joe Flacco opened the season as the starter before being benched and later traded to Cincinnati.\n\nCleveland’s draft capital adds another layer. The Browns hold the sixth overall selection in the 2026 draft, along with a second first-round pick acquired from Jacksonville.\n\nFor Sanders, the focus now turns inward. “It’s not in my hands, it’s not my decision,” he said, framing 2025 as a foundational learning year. As Cleveland resets yet again, that uncertainty defines the road ahead.\n\nBrowns star retiring?

    "title": "Browns HC search: Matt’s top 3 options include Kliff Kingsbury, potential wildcard",
    "description": "These 3 HC options could surprise some people, but they all have an excellent track record offensively.",
    "fullText": "Now that Cleveland has officially moved on from Kevin Stefanski, they could choose to go about finding their next head coach in a variety of different ways. One specific thing that their new head man will absolutely, without a doubt, have to do is find a quarterback.\n\nAs Andrew Berry recently said, the team doesn’t know who their starting quarterback will be in 2026, whether they’re already in the organization or outside of it. It seems that whoever they hire as the next head coach will have to be determined to find their ideal candidate almost immediately.\n\nBased on this ideology, three of the most realistic options could be:\n\nKingsbury is a coach who takes a no-nonsense approach to the offense. He knows the type of players he needs, especially at quarterback, and knows how to elevate them with an innovative, air-raid-esque scheme.\n\nHe’s also a coach who’s known to be aggressive when it comes to finding his guy at quarterback. His expertise from a passing game standpoint would also be a breath of fresh air for a Browns team that’s relied heavily on the run for almost a decade now. We’ve all seen what he recently did in Washington with Jayden Daniels, and it would be nice to see something like that play out in Cleveland.\n\nSimilar to Kingsbury, McCarthy has a reputation around the league of being very specific about the quarterback position. He’s someone who usually won’t stop searching until he gets who he wants to lead the offense.\n\nThis is a completely different mindset from what Kevin Stefanski had, and it ultimately led to his demise in Cleveland, though he wasn’t the only one at fault.\n\nMcCarthy has a lot of fans and a lot of haters out there, but his ability to lead and be a winner is undeniable at the NFL level. Bringing in a veteran head coach with a winning past would also be something new in Northeast Ohio.\n\nNagy has shown the ability to be incredibly effective as an offensive playcaller, but he needs a legitimate quarterback to do so. He’s the type of offensive mind who wouldn’t be able to sleep until he has a quarterback that he knows can be successful in his offensive scheme.\n\nThough it didn’t work out for him as a head coach in Chicago, he still went 34-31 in his four seasons there and won the NFL’s Coach of the Year Award in 2018. Nagy is still seen as an excellent offensive-minded coach, and there’s a reason that he’s been to so many Super Bowls as an offensive coordinator.\n\nIf Cleveland hires any one of these three coaches, I truly believe that the Browns will have their next legitimate quarterback within their first two years with the organization.\n\nWho are some of your top options at Head Coach for Cleveland? Join fellow Browns fans in the comment section below.",

According to consistent reports from Fabrizio Romano and 'The Athletic', talks are said to have taken place today.\n\n\"Ole is ready to say YES,\" reports transfer expert Romano. He is expected to lead the team until the summer, after which a new coach will be appointed. Oliver Glasner remains the favorite for the position.\n\nAfter the club dismissed Ruben Amorim on Monday after just 14 months in charge—his explosive outburst following the draw against Leeds proved to be the final straw for the club's leadership—United initially appointed U18 coach Darren Fletcher as interim manager.\n\nThe Scotsman will oversee the team in Wednesday's match at Burnley and is also expected to be on the sidelines for Sunday's FA Cup clash against Brighton. After that, United legend Solskjær could take over until the end of the season.\n\nBack in 2018, he had already taken over as interim coach and subsequently served as head coach from 2019 to 2021.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "Former Arizona Cardinals head coach will apparently get a look from New York.",
    "fullText": "Kliff Kingsbury is leaving his job as Washington Commanders offensive coordinator to “pursue other opportunities.” One of those opportunities is likely to be with the New York Giants, where Kingsbury is expected to interview for the team’s vacant head-coaching position.\n\nKingsbury was offensive coordinator with Washington the past two seasons. His parting with the Commanders was described as a mutual decision between Kingsbury and Washington head coach Dan Quinn.\n\nKingsbury was praised for his work with the Commanders during Jayden Daniels’ 2024 rookie season as Washington went to the playoffs and had one of the league’s better offenses. With Daniels suffering through an injury-plagued 2025, the Commanders won just five games and Kingsbury’s offense was not nearly as prolific.\n\nDaniels and other Commanders players are apparently not happy with Kingsbury’s exit.\n\nKingsbury was head coach of the Arizona Cardinals for four seasons, from 2019-2022. He compiled a 28-37-1 (.432 winning percentage). His best season was 2021, when the Cardinals went 11-6 and lost in the Wild Card round of the playoffs to the eventual Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams.\n\nPrior to Arizona, Kingsbury went 35-40 (.467) in six seasons as head coach at Texas Tech.\n\nI discussed Kingsbury with David Harrison, Commanders insider for Locked on Commanders, recently. Harrison said he would “lean to the side of no,” when I asked him if he thought Kingsbury should be in the conversation for the Giants.\n\n“I think that to be fair, like I don’t get to see, and you know this obviously, but to those who don’t, I don’t get to see Cliff do his day-to-day job and and all those things and full interaction with the players. So there there’s got to be a big grain of salt taken with I think any media member’s opinion on whether or not a guy would be a good head coach,” Harrison said. “But just looking at some of the things I can look at, Cliff still seems to be a guy who is very much kind of stuck in his way.\n\n“Kliff Kingsbury at the end of the day when he feels the he has the excuse, when he feels he has the reason, he’s going to revert back to what he wants to do. It’s not really about what is best for my team. It’s not and and don’t me wrong, like he thinks it’s best for his team, right? I should I should definitely put that in there. It’s not like he’s saying, “I don’t care that that’s what’s best. I want to do what I want to do.” Like, he thinks it’s best for his team. But what he doesn’t have is the situational awareness to understand that like, ‘No, it’s not’.\n\n“… until the head man says, “Hey dude, this is what we’re going to do.” He’s not going to see it himself. And if I’m hiring a head coach, I need a guy that can see the picture for what it is, not see the confirmation bias, that he wants to tell himself that he’s right all the time. And I just don’t think that Cliff is there.”",

    "fullText": "Slovenian Domen Prevc matched his brother's feat 10 years ago by clinching his first Four Hills title after finishing second in the final leg of the prestigious ski-jumping competition on Tuesday.\n\nThe World Cup leader jumped last in the first round on the Bischofshofen large hill but showed no signs of nerves to top the halfway rankings with 138 metres.\n\nA second jump of 138.5m for a combined 299.8 points meant he was nudged into second by last year's Four Hills winner and defending World Cup champion Daniel Tschofenig, who managed 137m and 140.5m for 303.9 in front of cheering home fans in Austria.\n\nThree-times Four Hills champion Ryoyu Kobayashi was third on the night.\n\nPrevc still triumphed over the four events, having won the German legs in Oberstdorf and Garmisch-Partenkirchen as part of seven victories in eight World Cup meets.\n\n\"You feel super blessed, you feel super amazing, super overwhelming,\" he told ARD.\n\n\"I'm super proud of my work, finally things came together at the right moment, at the right time. Winning the Golden Eagle is a childhood dream, a childhood dream that came true. I was dreaming about this moment.\"\n\nHe narrowly lost out to Ren Nikaido in Innsbruck at the weekend to end his hopes of a rare Four Hills clean sweep. Overall Prevc scored 1,195.6 in the Four Hills ahead of Austrian duo Jan Hörl and Stephan Embacher.\n\nThe 26-year-old world champion looks the favourite for Winter Olympic glory in Milan/Cortina next month and is part of the first sibling duo to win ski jumping's famed prize.\n\nDomen's older brother Peter Prevc won the Four Hills in 2016 and there is a further reason for a big party in the Prevc household.\n\nIn the women's World Cup, Domen's sister Nika Prevc wrapped up back-to-back wins in Austria's Villach as she extended her lead in the overall standings - having recently also won the women's Two Nights Tour.\n\nThe 2024 and 2025 World Cup champion edged Austrian Lisa Eder by 0.6 points, with Germany's Agnes Reisch picking up her first podium of the season on the normal hill.\n\nThe next World Cup ski-jumping action for the men is a super team event on the Zakopane large hill in Poland on Saturday, when the women take to the normal hill in Slovenia's Ljubno.",

    "fullText": "Texas transfer redshirt freshman wide receiver Parker Livingstone has committed to rival Oklahoma, On3’s Hayes Fawcett and Pete Nakos report.\n\nLivingstone, who was a four-star recruit out of Lovejoy in the 2024 class, exploded onto the scene for the Longhorns in 2025. The Lucas, TX native hauled in 29 receptions for 516 yards and six touchdowns. He caught two passes for 29 yards in Texas’ 23-6 win over Oklahoma on Oct. 11.\n\nThe departure of Livingstone came as a big blow to Texas starting quarterback Arch Manning, who was Livingstone’s roommate in Austin. As news of his transfer emerged, Manning posted an Instagram story of him and Livingstone with a teary-eyed emoji.\n\nLivingstone now joins an Oklahoma program fresh off an appearance in the College Football Playoff. The Sooners went up 17-0 over Alabama in their First Round matchup, but were outscored 34-7 over the remainder of the game in a 34-24 loss.\n\nDespite the loss, head coach Brent Venables made it clear how proud he was of both the players returning next season and those moving on: “We couldn’t have done it if they didn’t stick with it, if they didn’t continue to believe when a lot of the things were going on around them,” Venables elaborated. “They could’ve bowed out, and they chose not to.”\n\nAlthough it appeared he could be one of the top quarterback prospects in the 2026 NFL Draft following a red-hot start to the season, quarterback John Mateer will likely return to Norman for his redshirt senior. season. In 12 games this season, Mateer completed 62.2% of passes for 2,885 yards and 14 touchdowns with 11 interceptions. He also totaled 431 yards and eight scores on the ground.\n\nMateer addressed his future immediately following the Sooners’ loss to the Crimson Tide. He was non-committal when discussing what’s next for his football career. “I haven’t really thought about it yet,” Mateer said. “I’m pretty sure I’ll take some time and weigh all the options and we’ll see.”\n\nESPN’s Kirk Herbstreit however implored Mateer to return to Norman next season. “Why would he leave a place that’s become home? I guess if someone paid him,” Herbstreit said. “My guess is, he’s going back to OU.”\n\nWith Mateer and Livingstone leading the OU offense, back-to-back College Football Playoff appearances are certainly the expectation for the Sooner faithful.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire.\n\nThe On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.",

    "fullText": "Interim Manchester United boss Darren Fletcher confirmed that he expects Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes to be back in the squad to face Burnley this midweek.\n\nFletcher took his first press conference as United boss after Ruben Amorim was sacked by the club on Monday.\n\nFernandes has missed the last three Premier League matches with a hamstring injury and Mount has missed the last two with a knock.\n\nFletcher gave injury updates on the pair.\n\n“”I think Ruben [Amorim] alluded to it,” he said. “Mason and Bruno were pushing to play against Leeds, but the decision was that they weren’t quite ready. They have trained and they should be back in the squad.\n\n“They will be on managed minutes because they have only just returned to training. That is good news obviously to have players back who have been in good form. Mount’s form has been fantastic and Bruno Fernandes, well we don’t have to speak about Bruno.\n\n“He’s the captain, the leader of the team. To have them available for selection is great news for me, the players, the club and the fans.”\n\nThe match against Burnley will be Fletcher’s first as manager since Amorim was sacked and he was asked whether he thinks he will stay on for more after the match.\n\n“Honestly, it’s not something I’ve thought about,” he explained. “I’m focusing on Burnley. I think that discussion is for after the game.\n\n“There has been that much going on and it has all happened so quickly that all my concentration, efforts and thoughts have gone into Burnley. I know that sounds like a generic answer but it is what it is.”\n\nThe Scotsman made 342 appearances in 20 years as a player at the club and he reflected on now being able to lead the team out as manager this week.\n\n“”Surreal [24 hours]. As you say, it’s an amazing honour to be able to lead a Manchester United team,” Fletcher said. “I don’t even think it was in my wildest dreams that it could potentially happen, even thinking about playing for the club and stuff like that.\n\n“But to lead out the team is an amazing honour and something I am really proud to do.\n\n“It’s not [happened] in the circumstances that I expected it to happen, it is something that doesn’t sit quite easy with me, but I just have to think of having a job to do and I’ve got to lead the team tomorrow and think of the great honour and pride in doing that.”",

    "title": "Trae Young trade destinations: What's next for the Hawks and their All-Star guard?",
    "description": "Where could Trae Young land? And should Atlanta pursue Anthony Davis?",
    "fullText": "Trae Young and the Hawks are reportedly working together on a trade. Where could the four-time All-Star land? Could he be the starting point guard on a title team? And should Atlanta pursue Anthony Davis, whom it has reportedly shown interest in? Our writers weigh in.\n\nTom Haberstroh: It’s about time. The Hawks have clearly checked out with Young on the floor, allowing 126.2 points per 100 possessions with Ice Trae on the court this season. That’s the highest rate for any starter in the league, and an embarrassing figure for an All-Star. With Jalen Johnson taking the wheel, Young’s defensive liabilities became too much to handle.\n\nSteve Jones: I’m not surprised. Good intentions don’t always lead to great results and it was clear the Hawks had gotten a new wardrobe, took the long road home and stopped telling their franchise player about the future. It’s time for both sides to move on and focus on the future. I’m sure Young will look to remind the world what he’s capable of contributing moving forward.\n\nMorten Stig Jensen: While I think Young does have significant upside, fact is, that upside has turned far more theoretical than practical. He just doesn't weave himself into the fabric of a team offense, and we obviously know of his defensive limitations. As such, the Hawks can surely find better use for his forthcoming $49 million salary slot, as they build around Johnson.\n\nBen Rohrbach: Not surprising. I’m sure the Hawks have canvassed the trade market for Trae Young for some time. If they haven’t, they have been derelict of duty. They have long been better defensively without Young, and now they have an offense that can serve that defense without Young. Why not gauge interest from around the league, to see if they can improve that edition of this team? The question, then, is whether they can secure anything close to equal value for him.\n\nRohrbach: The Minnesota Timberwolves? They are the only team that would have the array of defenders — Anthony Edwards, Jaden McDaniels, Julius Randle and Rudy Gobert — to create a championship-caliber outfit around Young. Of course, they surely would have to give up one of those salaries in order to make the math work on a Young deal, and that could tip the scales against Young’s fit on a title contender. These are inherent issues around trading Young’s salary.\n\nJones: I believe he is spiritually a Washington Wizard or a Sacramento King.\n\nJensen: Chicago Bulls? With Young insisting upon being the primary player, likely negating championship upside in the process, we need to identify a team wherein that's not a problem. Hello, Chicago? The Bulls have the necessary expiring contracts to get it done, and Young's presence would allow Josh Giddey to play his more natural position.\n\nHaberstroh: On the waiver wire. That way, we can get him to fun places. His contract — $46 million this season and a $49 million player option next season — makes any trade so challenging. Minnesota would be an ideal fit with Gobert, but the Wolves really can’t make the money work unless Gobert is included. I just don’t love anywhere else.\n\nJones: Absolutely not. If you did not feel like you could it done with Trae Young, what would make you believe you can do it with Anthony Davis? Build toward the future.\n\nHaberstroh: I wouldn’t. Move off of Young, but keep this thing going with the youngsters. I’d rather have Kristaps Porziņģis on a $30.7 million expiring deal and try to work out a sensible deal in free agency than go after Davis, who will be looking for a max extension in the offseason. Doubling down on AD at this point in his career reeks of desperation.\n\nRohrbach: To what end? I don’t think Davis transforms a Trae Young-less Hawks roster into a championship contender, especially as an oft-injured big man aging into his mid-30s. His timeline does not mesh with the new version of Atlanta, which boasts Jalen Johnson, Dyson Daniels and Zaccharie Risacher as young, exciting wings. There is already an oft-injured big on the roster. Why not spend Porziņģis’ expiring salary more wisely in free agency in the summer?\n\nJensen: Trading for a soon-to-be 33-year-old, who is often injured, has lost a step athletically, and is owed $111 million after the conclusion of this season is just never a good idea, so that would be a hard no from me.\n\nJensen: True, if he's able to adjust his game and conclude he's not the best player on the team. He'd have to be better off-ball, integrate himself as more of a helper, than the heliocentric player that he is. Defensively, I'm not sure there's anything he can do, so it would make sense for that team to have elite defenders around him, and at least a real superstar helming everything.\n\nHaberstroh: True, only if Wemby is his center. It’s looking more and more that the deep playoff run in 2021 was an aberration. He presents so many problems defensively that he requires an all-time center to put out all the fires behind him. Elite passer. So-so shooter. Calamitous defender.\n\nRohrbach: True, to a degree. I do not think a team that counts Young as the high-usage engine of its offense can win a championship. Now, if you were to build a team of talented two-way players (like the Timberwolves) around Young, and he were to accept his role as a secondary or tertiary option to a more well-rounded superstar, who is to say that version of the four-time All-Star point guard — an idealized one we’ve long anticipated — couldn’t help a team to a title.\n\nJones: Yes, it’s a possibility. He has scoring and playmaking, and he draws attention in pick-and-roll. On the right squad, with the right defenders and the right balance it could happen. Find a way to nail show and recover and hope everything else pays off.",

    "fullText": "Marco Brescianini is emerging as one of the most sought-after midfielders ahead of the January window, with interest now extending beyond Serie A to the Premier League.\n\nThe Atalanta midfielder is believed to be considering a move away from Bergamo in search of regular playing time, and several clubs are monitoring his situation closely.\n\nFiorentina and Lazio have both shown concrete interest in recent weeks, but they are no longer alone in the race.\n\nPARIS, FRANCE – SEPTEMBER 17: Marco Brescianini of Atalanta BC runs with the ball whilst under pressure from Ibrahim Mbaye of Paris Saint-Germain during the UEFA Champions League 2025/26 League Phase MD1 match between Paris Saint-Germain and Atalanta BC at Parc des Princes on September 17, 2025 in Paris, France. (Photo by Franco Arland/Getty Images)\n\nAccording to Tuttomercatoweb, via FirenzeViola, Bournemouth have also made an initial enquiry.\n\nThe Premier League side are understood to be gathering information at this stage rather than pushing ahead with a formal bid, but their involvement adds further competition.\n\nBournemouth’s interest is being driven by sporting director Tiago Pinto, a familiar figure in Italian football.\n\nAtalanta’s stance will be crucial.\n\nLECCE, ITALY – AUGUST 19: Marco Brescianini of Atalanta celebrates after scoring his team’s opening goal during the Serie A match between Lecce and Atalanta at Stadio Via del Mare on August 19, 2024 in Lecce, Italy. (Photo by Maurizio Lagana/Getty Images)\n\nThe club are not inclined to sanction a simple loan move and would instead seek an obligation to buy tied to conditions, or potentially a permanent transfer outright. That position could complicate negotiations for clubs hoping for a low-risk deal.\n\nWith Brescianini keen to find space and Atalanta open to evaluating offers on their terms, developments are expected in the coming days.\n\nThe midfielder appears increasingly likely to move on, but only if the right formula is found.",

    "fullText": "With six head-coaching openings in the NFL, and possibly more, Bill Belichick's name will be mentioned publicly for one or more of the jobs. Whether he's privately considered for any of them remains to be seen.\n\nAppearing on the Let’s Go! podcast, Belichick was asked by host Jim Gray whether Belichick is interested in returning to the NFL.\n\n“Nothing's changed,\" Belichick said. \"I’m where I was a month ago. I'm here at North Carolina. I really appreciate the love and support that we've gotten from the community down here, from the school, from Chancellor Roberts, the ADs, Bubba Cunningham, Steve Newmark, working with Mike Lombardi and our staff here. We're building a good program and I'm excited about the direction we're headed in.”\n\nIt wasn't a \"no.\" But it's not relevant until someone wants to talk to him.\n\nSince being fired two years ago, he has had one interview, with the Falcons. The Falcons are looking again, with a clean slate (for now) in the front office.\n\nWould owner Arthur Blank want to give Belichick another look, periodic trolling by Jordon Hudson notwithstanding? While it's unclear where his coaching skills currently reside (e.g., would Belichick put a defensive coach in charge of the offense?), we're confident that Belichick wouldn't have given $100 million guaranteed to Kirk Cousins before using a top-10 pick on Michael Penix Jr. if he'd been the Atlanta coach in 2024.\n\nBelichick is currently on the board for five existing vacancies: +4000 for the Giants, +8000 for the Titans, +4000 for the Browns, +1200 for the Falcons, and +1600 for the Raiders. (DraftKings doesn't have odds for the Cardinals' job, for some reason.)\n\nA team will first need to be interested in Belichick. And he'd need to be interested in the team. (Belichick expressed to Gray disdain for teams that use search firms, which could make the search firm running the Falcons' search less inclined to seek him out.)\n\nLast year, when it became clear to Belichick that he wouldn't get a job in the 2025 cycle, he went to North Carolina. Lombardi thereafter questioned whether there are any good jobs in the NFL, while also explaining that he and Belichick prefer working in college football.\n\nMost of the jobs that come open are open for a reason. Still, if Belichick wants to catch Don Shula for the all-time wins record, no number of victories at UNC will matter.",

    "description": "Texas A&M left guard Chase Bisontis has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft after three impressive seasons.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M's offensive line will look very different in 2026, as head coach Mike Elko and O-line coach Adam Cushing will need to replace four starters, now including junior left guard Chase Bisontis, who has officially declared for the 2026 NFL Draft after three successful seasons in College Station.\n\nA New Jersey native, Bisontis chose the Aggies over Rutgers in the 2023 recruiting class, bringing elite size and versatility at 6'5\" and 315 pounds, and during his first season with the Aggies, Bisontis started at right tackle amid former head coach Jimbo Fisher's final season at the helm.\n\nAfter Fisher was dismissed, Mike Elko felt that Adam Cushing was the perfect choice to help Bisontis reach his full potential, slotting him at left guard, where he has dominated ever since. Logging 1,962 snaps in his Texas A&M career, including 795 snaps, all at left guard during the 2025 season. Bisontis's elite strength will quickly translate to the next level, knowing that NFL scouts see him as a \"plug-and-play\" option at left or right guard.\n\nPro Football Focus graded Bisontis as an above-average pass protector (70.7) and average run blocker (62.7). Still, these grades, compared to most SEC starting guards, prove the level of defensive competition within the conference.\n\nOver the last three days, Texas A&M landed commitments from LSU transfer guard Coen Echols and South Carolina guard Trovon Baugh, which now makes even more sense given today's news. Needing size and SEC experience at left and right guard is key to avoiding a substantial drop-off in the trenches, and credit to Mike Elko for preparing for the inevitable.\n\nTexas A&M OL Chase Bisontis has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft, per his Instagram (chase_bisontis) 👍 #GigEm @CBisontis pic.twitter.com/iQfPNJsSQI\n\n— Luke Evangelist (@lukeevangelist_) January 6, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M star OL Chase Bisontis has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft",

    "description": "After her flight got cancelled, one woman explains how travel chaos is threatening her job and costing her thousands. She hopes to leave on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kaci Jane Hansen. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning on January 3rd, I was putting my suitcases in the back of an Uber and heading to the airport in San Juan after a Puerto Rican New Year's celebration with friends. They had all left on the 2nd, but my flight was early the next morning.\n\nA text came through to say my flight had been delayed by 360 minutes.\n\nOnce I got to the airport, it was totally chaotic. People were crying, and there was hardly space to move.\n\nI soon realized my flight wasn't just delayed — I wouldn't be getting back to New York that day. It was later confirmed that my flight had been canceled.\n\nI got on the phone with Delta to try to rebook my flight, and was told by an automated voice message that it would be a two-hour wait. When a representative finally came on the line, the call was accidentally ended. I phoned back and was told I would have to wait nine hours to speak with someone.\n\nWhile waiting on the phone, I made my way back to my hotel, where I had a quick sleep because my booking hadn't run over yet. But when I woke, I had to check out. There were people and suitcases in the lobby, everyone trying to get a room.\n\nDelta rebooked my flight for Thursday, January 8th, my birthday, and five days after my original flight was meant to be.\n\nJust out of curiosity, I checked to see how much it would cost to charter a private flight — it was about $22,000, which is clearly too expensive for me to afford.\n\nI managed to book an Airbnb until Thursday. I was really lucky to get somewhere because when I was looking, the availability just kept disappearing.\n\nAlthough I feel very fortunate to have a flight booked and a safe place to stay, I am terrified about how this may impact my work.\n\nFor the last year, I have been auditioning all over the US for a part in a production. I got it. It was going to be my big break. I told everyone about it and planned my life around the filming, which starts on January 6th.\n\nI'll still be stuck in Puerto Rico when filming starts.\n\nThe production team could cut me in two seconds. It would be perfectly justified if they did. That would mean that a year of sacrificing and working endlessly would have been for nothing. And what if I don't get another chance like this ever again, to do a job that I have worked so hard for?\n\nNo one is paying for this — for being stuck in Puerto Rico — except for me.\n\nI've had to shell out at least $3,000 for the extra five days here. That's a lot of money I didn't budget to spend. Everything I'm spending is out of pocket — I'll never get reimbursed.\n\nAnd if they drop me from this role, my next paycheck isn't going to come.\n\nEach time I think about the impact this delay in Puerto Rico could have on the future of my career, I get anxious and tearful. I'm trying, I'm really trying, to have a sense of humor and see some bright side in all this, but I'm struggling right now.",

    "description": "Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport has experienced five days of mass cancellations and huge delays due to snow.",
    "fullText": "Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport has led the world in cancellations over the past few days as snow disrupted travel in the Netherlands.\n\nMore than 2,700 flights were canceled in and out of the Dutch capital between last Friday and Tuesday, as of 4 p.m. per data from FlightAware.\n\nIn that time, the cancellation rate rose from 28% to around half of all scheduled flights.\n\nHandling over 66 million passengers a year, Amsterdam is the fourth-busiest airport in Europe and is a major hub for transcontinental travellers.\n\nAs it has a temperate climate and is near the sea, snow is relatively rare in Amsterdam. As such, when it does happen, it can have an outsize impact on travel. This week, several issues, including the snow, high winds, and a lack of capacity for de-icing planes in the cold weather, have combined to exacerbate the disruption at Schiphol Airport.\n\nData from Flightradar24 showed the chaos on the tarmac on Monday.\n\nA KLM flight was supposed to take off for London at 9 a.m. But after it left the gate, it taxied around the airport twice before going back to the gate after almost two and a half hours.\n\nFlight-tracking data also showed how an Emirates Airbus A380 spent three hours on the tarmac after landing before being able to move to its assigned gate.\n\nIt later flew back to Dubai, seven hours behind schedule.\n\nFor about an hour on Monday morning, some incoming flights had to divert while the weather was at its worst, an airport spokesperson said.\n\nThese included an Air Canada flight that diverted to Frankfurt, Germany; two KLM flights from South America that landed in Paris; and a Garuda Indonesia flight from Jakarta that ended up in Brussels.\n\nFlights that were still able to take off from Schiphol have faced average delays of almost two hours.\n\nWith temperatures below freezing, the delays are, in part, being caused by queues for de-icing. Every plane has to be clear of snow and ice before it can take off.\n\nKLM, the Dutch flag carrier, said it is responsible for de-icing most of the planes at Schiphol. However, it added, stocks of de-icing fluid are running low and its German supplier \"is unable to guarantee timely replenishment.\"\n\n\"This challenge is currently widespread across Europe,\" the airline said. \"KLM is doing everything possible to secure additional supply, for example, KLM will collect the fluid itself in Germany.\"\n\nIt added that its 25 de-icing trucks have all been in continuous use since Friday, and its team of 100 employees has been working \"around the clock.\"\n\nThe Schiphol spokesperson said the airport is \"continuing to monitor the weather situation closely.\"\n\n\"At present, only limited flight operations are possible,\" they added.\n\nAre you caught up in the disruption in Amsterdam?

As of Monday's close, Interactive Brokers founder Thomas Peterffy is a distant runner up with a roughly $8 billion gain.\n\nIt's not exactly clear why Musk's fortune has swelled this year.

    "fullText": "Thank You For Your Feedback Loop is a newsletter that shares previously unpublished reporting and analysis on the elite capture of disability movements. We will do our very best to post four times a year and thank paid subscribers for their patience and dedication to our work.\n\nIn 2017, Caroline Casey “rode 5 weeks across Colombia on horseback from Cartagena to Bogota [and] onto the main stage” of a conference that is “often referred to as junior Davos” where Paul Polman, then CEO of Unilever was in attendance. According to Casey, she did this to “capture his attention because everybody kept me away from him, [and] I’m known to generally eventually get what I need.”\n\nCasey’s stunt had her intended effect, and Polman became her first “follower.” Leveraging his connections, “Casey succeeded in bringing disability inclusion onto the main stage at DAVOS for the first time ever.” She used the platform to launch a campaign to recruit 500 CEOs to sign a pledge to “end the inclusion delusion that left disability outside the inclusion and diversity agenda.” She called her project the Valuable 500, which got its name when “we picked a number. We said 500 - The Fortune 500, The Valuable 500.”\n\nThere’s a reason why it took them just two years and four months to get 500 CEOs to sign their pledge. According to Valuable 500 CEO Katy Talikowska, “for too long, companies have made empty promises without being held accountable.” It’s a dynamic feminist writer Sara Ahmed writes about, in which commitments have “become a way of not doing something by appearing to do something.”\n\nTo prevent the “commitment to action” from being the CEO’s only action, the Valuable 500 spent two years planning for SYNC25, their “world’s first accountability summit for disability inclusion.” Accountability was supposed to distinguish SYNC25 from what Ahmed calls nonperformativity, which “works because it fails to bring about what it names.”\n\nAccountability for a company should seemingly involve recognizing how their policies and products have excluded disabled workers and consumers, and also how their policies and products have created disability globally, admitting these failings, and changing their policies and products. But this is not the accountability the Valuable 500 — which “maintains an apolitical, neutral, and industry-agnostic position, engaging with companies solely based on their commitment to ending disability exclusion” — had in mind.\n\nTheir “Guiding Principle” functions as an assurance that the Valuable 500 will do the bidding of its corporate funders. Talikowska attempted to further assuage possible CEO concerns by hiding much of SYNC25 behind closed doors, with “content that we will be capturing and that we’ll be sharing in the spirit of it being available.” She then went even further, stating the accountability at SYNC25 would obscure corporate failures through consolidated and aggregated data while spotlighting successes (or things that can be spun into stories of success) because, according to Casey, “we don’t chastise or demonise anyone who hasn’t, who isn’t particularly progressed.”\n\nDespite all these protective measures, we can’t find evidence that a single current CEO bothered to show up. Compounding the embarrassment is the egregious claim that the Valuable 500 is a “global community of 500 CEOs,” the “world’s biggest” for disability business inclusion, second only in size and scope to the United Nations. But the only thing that ties those 500 CEOs to the Valuable 500 is their supposed signature on the pledge. Even with that, we don’t know what these CEOs signed, if any simply affirmed their assent, or if any had a delegate sign on their behalf. It is possible, if not likely that there are CEOs in their so-called community who have never heard of the Valuable 500.\n\nThis is the essence of parasociality. The Valuable 500 is in a one-sided relationship with what Casey Casey describes as “the most influential people in the world.” The need to do or say whatever it takes to appear in relation to power is not unique to Casey and her acolytes, as it is the very premise of inclusion. What differentiates the Valuable 500 is Casey’s dogged pursuit of those in power due to her fervent belief in their capacity to affect positive change:\n\n“Disability inclusion within business needs a fundamental culture shift, which needs to be led by the leader. Leaders make choices and those choices create culture. The only way we are going to resolve the current “inclusion delusion” is through the support, attention and intention of CEOs.”\n\nThe Parasocial Model of Disability, as we’re calling it, belies an expectation that the parasocial individual will be granted the same power as those they worship. Under this paradigm, individuals and organizations provide absolution to power while packaging it as actionist accountability. Rather than tell a story of rejection that would have resonated with these CEO’s disabled workers, the Valuable 500 instead hyped the midlevel attendees of SYNC25 as “global leaders, trailblazers, and innovators.” The Valuable 500 is invested in maintaining an illusion of linear progress in order to “match the scope” of CEOs who are rewarded for their growth at all costs mindset.\n\nA May 18th, 2021 press release celebrating the 500th CEO to sign the Valuable 500 pledge notably left his name – Tim Cook of Apple – absent. For an organization that is prone to gaffes, such as the commitment to “eradicate disability inclusion” headline that remains uncorrected even after six years, the Valuable 500 never misses a chance to name drop. So his omission prompts questions for us about the extent of his commitment to the Valuable 500 way.\n\nIn the press release, Casey claims \"today we have broken the silence on disability inclusion.\" This was something “Caroline would say ending the CEO silence on disability” in an occasional interview. But up until this moment, the Valuable 500 as an entity had not mentioned the existence of a silence and a mission to bring about its end. The mission to end “the CEO silence on disability exclusion” wasn’t realized when Paul Polman became the first “follower” of the Valuable 500. “The CEO silence on disability exclusion” also didn’t end when 498 other CEO’s, from companies including the Valuable 500’s chosen list of Allianz, BBC, BP, The Coca-Cola Company, Daimler, Deloitte, EY, Google, Microsoft, Nestle, P&G, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., Prada, Shell, Sky, Sony, Twitter, Unilever, Virgin Media, Verizon and Vodafone signed the pledge.\n\nIt wasn’t until Cook supposedly added his name that silence had been both named and broken. Did anyone at Apple know he was being signed up for a bait and switch that would erase their own corporate disability inclusion history? What about the 499 other executives that came before? Were they aware Casey was going around claiming “Before Paul Polman, who's the chair of The Valuable 500, we haven't had leaders who stood up and said, ‘You know what? We're going to do this, we're going to do this [...] It's not okay in 2019 actually”?\n\nThe reality is, Cook had a history of speaking out on the topic of disability inclusion. On Global Accessibility Awareness Day in 2017, Tim Cook said of Apple that “we believe very deeply that accessibility's a human right” during an interview with James Rath, a filmmaker who is disabled due to ocular albinism. Rath secured the interview a year after Cook saw a video he uploaded to YouTube detailing “How Apple Saved My Life.” In the video Rath describes bullying throughout his childhood and struggles in school because of the stigmatizing accessibility tools he was provided with.\n\nJames Rath shares the same diagnosis as Caroline Casey, though she portrays her childhood as special, but without needs. She grew up “thinking that I saw like any other child” even though “she could and still can read with her nose pressed to a book but couldn’t see the blackboard. How nobody wanted to pick her for the hockey team but it never stopped her believing that she had the potential to be an excellent sportswoman. How her Dad taught her to sail. “I was put in a little Optimist [dinghy] on Lough Derg. Dad said, ‘Do you see that rock?’, and I said ‘Uh, no’, and he would say, ‘Just go in that general direction, feel the wind in your face.’”\n\nGrowing up, Rath “always knew I had poor eyesight or low vision that was not correctable,” but he didn’t realize until he was older that his low vision “qualified as legally blind.” Casey also had a realization, but with one hell of a twist. From her 2010 TED Talk:\n\n“on my seventeenth birthday, I accompanied my little sister in complete innocence, as I always had all my life -- my visually impaired sister -- to go to see an eye specialist. Because big sisters are always supposed to support their little sisters [...] I used to get my eyes tested just for fun. And on my seventeenth birthday, after my fake eye exam [...] he turned to my mother, and he said, \"You haven't told her yet?\"\n\nCaroline’s TED Talk conveniently omits key details that have emerged over the years. In alternate recountings, Casey says she wore glasses throughout her childhood, casting doubt on her claim that she got fake eye exams for fun. In her TED Talk, she says her parents “decided to tell me that I could see.” But in other tellings, she clarifies she “had no idea that I was at the level of registered blind” which implies a level of awareness of something she has since attributed to “a combination of total denial and lack of acceptance.” When these details are factored in, Casey’s story, in which a child lacked an awareness of a legal classification, becomes strikingly similar to Rath’s.\n\nCasey’s disability origin story fast forwards over a decade to 1999, when she “came out of [the disability] closet” (which is something the queer authors of this piece experience as lateral appropriation, in which “the discursive capital of one marginalized group is usurped by another similarly marginalized group”). That evening, she decided to go for a run. Despite the familiar route, she fell. And when she landed, she apparently hit upon an idea.\n\nShe hurried home to her bookcase, where a book, featuring a shirtless white man who was “determined to have [his] picture expressed in [his] next book sitting upon an elephant” according to the intro. The book, Travels on my Elephant, recalls the time Mark Shand, the “aristocratic playboy” brother of Queen Consort Camilla Parker Bowles bought an elephant and rode her 600 miles across India.\n\nCasey “made a decision that day that I too would go to India, become a mahout and travel across the country on elephant back.” So she wrote to Shand, and with his help, got her very own elephant, albeit one she intended “only to rent.” But the moment she met Kanchi, she “fell in love and knew she would be mine for good.” How must that encounter have felt to Kanchi? As Casey recalls:\n\n“The entire village had come out to watch this strange spectacle of a blonde girl approaching this massive elephant with all these cameras trailing her. As I walked up to her, we were both silent and looking at each other. I started crying because this was everything I had ever dreamed of. I touched my forehead to her trunk.”\n\nFor the next four months, Casey lived out her dream of becoming Mowgli from the Jungle Book, by riding Kanchi, her captive elephant 1,000km across India. Early on, at least, she understood “a lot of people had problems with” a “western woman riding bareback on an elephant.” She also describes one of Kanchi’s mahouts as being skeptical of Caroline’s motivations for wanting to “learn about living and working with elephants.” The skepticism seems to be warranted, as she portrays herself as an exotic white woman, setting foot in a foreign land:\n\n“On the first day of the trek, curious Keralans followed Casey all day. “I was presented with flowers, propositioned — not much I could do with that on an elephant — offered husbands, given bananas to beat the band and caused two schools to come to a complete standstill,” Casey excitedly told reporters after her kickass trek.”\n\nDecades have passed, and the story that has taken hold involves Casey becoming “the first western woman to achieve the status of elephant mahout” upon completing her solo journey across India. A mahout – the ancient trade, dating back to the onset of kingship, where a handler didn’t just train and guide his elephant into battle, but bonded with it for life. These days, the once honorable vocation, built on knowledge that “has always been transferred within families and within a tightly knit community” is now on the brink of extinction. No longer a living wage, mahouts are paid a pittance for a lifetime’s commitment.\n\nCasey’s solo trek – along with the National Geographic film crew that was documenting it – was led by Indian guides and a mahout. We can’t help but wonder what sort of bearing Shand’s relationship with the monarchy had on their decision to guide her glorified eco-tour. Was he also the intended audience for some sort of ceremony or misunderstanding through which Casey came to believe she was certifiably something she was not?\n\nHonorifics aren’t one way gestures; recipients are expected to be transparent about the title being honorary, so as not to mislead the general public about their qualifications. For example, “it is generally considered improper practice for the recipient of an honorary doctorate to use the formal title of Doctor.” That’s because “Honoris causa degrees are not considered of the same [regard] as substantive degrees earned by the standard academic processes of courses and original research.”\n\nIt seems that etiquette would also apply to an honorary mahout. Unfortunately, Casey has made a spectacle of the title, using it to regale western audiences with her exploits in order to legitimize the fame she sought to generate through this stunt. By qualifying herself as the first western woman, rather than a glorified ecotourist committing animal cruelty, she erases the emergence of Indian women, such as Parbati Barua, who is gaining recognition for her work as a mahout.\n\nLike with so many things it’s a pattern, because it’s not just Casey’s honorary status as a mahout that she uses to inflate her credentials. After receiving honorary degrees from the University of Bath and University College Dublin, she updated her LinkedIN profile to read Dr. Caroline Casey. Both of these degrees cite her elephant trek as being a catalyst in becoming “one so young, that, like Alexander the Great, she has conquered worlds while still in her thirties.”\n\nCasey claims the idea of riding an elephant originated from her childhood memories of the 1967 animated Disney Jungle Book film. But Mowgli never rode an elephant in the film. In fact, Rudyard Kipling’s actual Jungle Book only mentioned the riding of elephants once in Mowgli’s chapters, when it refers to “the arrival of white men on elephants, with guns.” Disney’s animated rendition coded the jungle animals as black while Mowgli was coded as a white man who would eventually come to rule, leaving us to wonder just how much the role of colonizer appealed to Casey.\n\nWhen Casey “came off the elephant, [she] started into this work immediately. [She] wanted to be part of ending global exclusion.” It took a few iterations before she landed on the Valuable 500. While she says her focus is “very specifically disability exclusion,” she has taken up the rhetoric of intersectionality. In a speech at the United Nations, Casey made intersectionality into a zero sum game, explaining “the inclusion agenda in business, carves up our humanity into different categories, gender or race, LGBTQ and age - either way, we're carved up and we have to compete against each other for attention and resources. And in that competition, disability has always lost out.” Her “Reality of Intersectional Experience,” begins with disability and then adds on “race, gender, sexuality, class, and countless other aspects of identity that shape how individuals experience both the workplace and the wider world.”\n\nDr. Ashlee Christoffersen, author of The Politics of Intersectional Practice, a book that focuses on the different ways UK NGOs interpret intersectional practice, offered some clarity when asked about why it has been so difficult to extrapolate meaning from Casey’s manipulation of intersectional-speak. Women in positions of power have begun to use their newly acquired fluency in intersectionality to obscure their intentions and actions. Christoffersen has also encountered this dynamic in her work and is similarly grappling with how to truly understand what her research participants actually believe.\n\nA 2023 paper Christoffersen co-authored with Dr. Akwugo Emejulu, a sociologist who studies racial, gender and class inequalities, found that intersectionality projects that focus on disability rather than race tend to speak “to a broader European project of erasing race and putting disability in competition with race.” On one rare occasion when the subject of blackness did arise in an interview, Casey notably dog whistled ‘all lives matter’ rhetoric, saying Black Lives Matter created a “brilliant opportunity” to say “all humanity.” She describes having been in “conversations and heard stuff like, “well, now we're going to focus on the Black community.” And I'm going, but what about the full intersectional lived black experience?” It’s as though she’s using intersectionality to redirect the conversation back to a narrative of disability that can control.\n\nBefore intersectionality turned into an “empty gesture that reaffirms white supremacy,” it began as a critique of the discrimination that black women experience being “defined respectively by white women's and Black men's experiences.” The word intersectionality was developed by American civil rights advocate and scholar of critical race theory, Kimberlé Crenshaw.\n\nIntersectionality was conceived as a justice framework, written for the University of Chicago Legal Forum in 1989 to address “the limitations of antidiscrimination law” with regard to the violence black women face. It’s not just that white women have appropriated a black feminist concept, it’s that their appropriation has subsumed a survival strategy into capitalism.\n\nChristoffersen and Emejulu have found that white women at the helm of feminist organizations position themselves as “the only true arbiters of intersectionality” when they “universalize themselves and their particular experiences and position themselves as the only legitimate representatives of the group as a whole.” This is where Casey’s omniscience derives:\n\n“Let me just tell you what intersectionality is. Replace that word with ‘human being’. I am a woman. I have a vision impairment and a disability, and I am proud of both of those. Intersectionality is about not categorizing our humanity into silos, which compete.”\n\nWhen Crenshaw is asked about what has come of intersectionality, she says “this is what happens when an idea travels beyond the context and the content.” That’s why it is so important to tie ideas to their originators - something we have found no evidence of Casey doing. Instead she just takes it, depoliticizes it, and uses it to undergird her authority.\n\nDuring a podcast interview in the lead up to SYNC25, Casey bragged to the host that she has been approached by multiple academic institutions to write a case study, because “we could be writing a new blueprint for social change.” That “missing link” is synchronicity, not only to “prove disability inclusion, but [...] make social change happen.” The podcast host responds; “Brilliant. So good!”\n\nCasey supposedly took ”inspiration from a murmuration, the awe-inspiring phenomenon in which very large groups of birds, fishes or insects move and change direction together.” Some readers may recognize the metaphor of murmurations that arose for Casey in late 2021 from a monthly column for Yes! Media which began earlier that year. The author of that column; the mixed race black feminist and facilitator adrienne maree brown is drawn to murmurations as a metaphor, because there is no “central leader orchestrating” the movement.\n\nCasey fantasizes about orchestrating a “moment, if you can imagine, like you stand 500 people in a field, looking up at the stars and seeing what’s possible.” In many ways, “this ridiculous behavior that I've had” has made Casey into Stewie of corporate disability inclusion, constantly proclaiming “look what I can do.” This time it involves marching 500 of what she perceives as “the most influential people in the world” to a dark field to obey her command.\n\nCasey’s missing link is actually the co-optation of a core principle from brown’s 2017 book Emergent Strategy, which provides a frame to think critically about organizations such as the Valuable 500, that are “structured in ways that reflect the status quo. We have singular charismatic leaders, top down structures, money-driven programs, destructive methods of engaging conflict, unsustainable work cultures, and little to no impact on the issues at hand.”\n\nThe Valuable 500 overinflates its value by claiming to represent every single individual who is employed by their partner companies, a whopping 22 million people, few of whom have any idea the Valuable 500 even exists. One CEO for every 44,000 workers is not collective action, but rather a form of elite capture that was described by brown’s mentor, the late social activist and philosopher Grace Lee Boggs, as “an idea that is progressive at one point can turn into its opposite at a later point.”\n\nThroughout 2025, as black women and other racialized employees have been disproportionately purged from the workforce as a result of Trump’s Executive Order to dismantle DEI, the Valuable 500 kept mum. Instead, they hosted the “first-ever Valuable 500 Africa Summit on disability inclusion” in, of all places, South Africa. “The Summit achieved its founding ambition: establishing Valuable 500 Africa as an African-led, African-built chapter of our global movement.” The African at the helm of the organization the Valuable 500 partnered with is white. While the handbook for the event is filled cover to cover with stock images of black people, images from the summit predominantly feature white professionals.\n\nGiven all that Casey has taken from black culture, one might presume she would show a marker of solidarity (or tokenization) – such as black team members or advisors to the Valuable 500. But we couldn’t find any. This brings us back to the ways Ahmed”s ‘non-performativity’ serves the interests of the disinterested, because it fails to do what it says. Drawing also on the work of Dr. Jennifer C. Nash, it’s an idea Christoffersen has built upon through intersectionality that “is mobilised in order to not do intersectionality.”\n\nAccording to Boggs, “any group that achieve power, no matter how oppressed, is not going to act differently from their oppressors as long as they have not confronted the values that they have internalized and consciously adopted different values.” Casey achieved power by “taking a story that resonates [and] layering that with smart marketing strategies and cutting-edge public relations techniques” as corporate disability inclusion blogger Jonathan Kaufman wrote in his Forbes Contributor column in 2019.\n\nIndustry bloggers, podcast hosts, and LinkedIN influencers often build credibility through a form of access churnalism that flatters their subjects by regurgitating their talking points and narratives. They do this to market their own expertise and insider status, typically with the aim of securing consulting and other paid gigs. Their platform, no matter how small, then games SEO to such an extent that what rises to the surface are unchecked claims masquerading as the truth. That’s how Casey has become a singular, charismatic “one woman band” who is “creating a movement,” “building a global movement,” “launch[ing] the movement,” and “ignit[ing] a historic global movement for a new age of business inclusion.”\n\nCasey’s actual impact is one of consolidating an existing, albeit flawed grassroots labor movement, historicizing herself as the center of it, and locating it under her jurisdiction. This happened as more and more workers were finding purpose in advocacy and collective action around disability in the workplace. Needing to quell a movement that was gaining traction, the corporate apparatus outsourced their demands to advocates for disability inclusion in order to ensure whatever could have been will never be. Now, when employees organize to demand more and better, the powers-that-be can simply respond by saying they are addressing workplace accessibility and inclusion issues through their partnership with the Valuable 500.\n\nCasey’s desire “to be remembered as someone who [...] held themselves to account,” should exist in conflict with, in the words of Kaufman, her “acute awareness that her legacy will far outlast her.” But people are often remembered for things they didn’t do, and forgotten despite things they did do all the time. That’s what this industry attracts and emboldens, and why Kaufman similarly plugs himself in his bio as being “regarded as one of the most profound thinkers and practitioners in” his sentence goes on. A more accurate bio would own up to being a territory marker rather than euphemizing it as a self proclaimed “innovative thought leader.”\n\nWhat will likely be forgotten, like so much of our writing, is how Forbes removed Kaufman as a contributor in November 2023 after we reported that he failed to disclose his relationship to another corporate disability organization that he was writing glowingly about. His relationship to the Valuable 500 now reveals this as a pattern, in which Kaufman writes about those he wants to gain access to.\n\nKaufman’s 2019 article about Casey wasn’t a one off. Instead, it marked the beginning of years of laudatory writing on the Valuable 500, such as this piece in 2021, this piece in 2022, and this one in 2023. Then, in 2024, freshly shorn of his Forbes contributor status, Kaufman started writing directly rather than indirectly for them. The ‘collaboration,’ a white paper called Unlocking Disability-Inclusive Leadership, connected accountability to storytelling in order to render stories of \"good intentions\" unassailable by any who might contest the realities of those impacts.\n\nThat Kaufman was contracted to conduct this research after facing consequences for his duplicity shows that rather than taking responsibility, accountability becomes a task of identifying which skeletons to bury behind a positive story of corporate success. In Kaufman’s case, he simply altered his resume and moved on, trusting the next churnalist would come along to legitimize it with a little flourish. His resume item as “a regular Forbes contributor for four and a half years” has since evolved to having written “profilically” during his stint. Talking point, flattery, rinse and repeat.\n\nIt would be a mistake to assume that just because this particular piece is focusing on Caroline Casey, that she is the only one. This self promotional grift isn’t the work of outliers, it is who this work attracts and emboldens. In 2024, Vladimir Cuk, executive director for the International Disability Alliance resigned after an external review revealed “financial irregularities, and several reported cases of abuse of power and authority” as well as “mismanagement and corrupt behavior” including an “unduly compensated vacation,” bonuses, and fraud. Whether or not he still serves as a strategic partner to the Valuable 500 is unknown. No one has copped to scrapping his plans for “being involved in the progress the campaign will undoubtedly continue to make through phase 2,” i.e. the accountability phase they are now entering full scale.\n\nCuk’s resignation was brought to the attention of a slightly broader public when an industry newsletter decided “we need to talk.” The author of that newsletter, a consultant named Peter Torres Fremlin, echoed insider fears that the \"broader sector could be unfairly tarnished” by Cuk’s offenses. His analysis toggles between reckoning with the faultiness of “a consistent focus on funders and stakeholders rather than openness with the wider movement” while admitting he repugnantly believes “brushing dissent under the rug can be tactically useful.” Cuk didn’t chime in, instead, like Kaufman, he just updated his LinkedIN and moved on.\n\nIn 2025, Grant Stoner, a disabled journalist for IGN published extensive reporting about Mark Barlet, founder of AbleGamers, an organization that promotes accessibility in gaming. Details involve financial mismanagement, sexual harassment, emotional abuse, hostility, bullying, and a megalomania that led him to tell one accessibility advocate “You are a drop in the pond of accessibility. And I own the pond.” Rather than reckon with all he wrought, he issued a victim blaming statement, updated his LinkedIN, and moved on:\n\n“In the early days of AbleGamers [...] I was not willing to be patient or wait my turn. I didn’t seek permission to make change; I simply acted. As a former member of the military, I was mission-focused and driven by objectives, sometimes to a fault. I also recognize that I faced criticism from others because I was achieving success where others were not. I demanded a seat at the table, while many other advocates remained in circles of internal discussion and complaints.”\n\nOur own writing similarly highlights a rotating cast of corporate disability girlbosses who remain undeterred in their pursuit of power, and believe their capacity to steamroll uniquely equips them to — as Barlet is described — “be the only.” This is what it means to adopt the values of one’s oppressors. It is only when they feel secure with their foothold that they will wax poetic about intersectionality, or collaboration, or whatever virtue they need to render meaningless in order to continue gatekeeping power and resources.\n\nIt is absolutely reasonable to enter into activism with grand ambitions; we are a product of the imperialist, capitalist world we live in. The work of committing oneself to the people and unlearning these urges is painstaking. It’s a process many activists will remain engaged in for the duration of our lives. That’s what makes the Parasocial Model of Disability such an abomination. A select few among us will refuse unlearning, because they feel justified in their conquest – even in 2025. More and more it feels like they are locked in a time warp, still attempting to dominate a world that no longer exists.\n\nWriting about this rotating cast of characters is a daunting task. While they’re virtually unknown to the broader public, they tend to believe they carry some level of fame. They expect to be lionized as revolutionaries who are effecting the transformational change they are deployed to obstruct. They double speak the language of justice but act upon it in accordance with power. This kind of writing is not just uncomfortable for us and our subjects, it can also be uncomfortable for readers who regard these individuals as private citizens, despite the troves of information they have conceded to the public sphere. But it’s important for all parties to sit with it, because there will always be a next grifter, rearing to hoard movement resources that belong to the many. This brings us to the point of this piece:\n\nIn a renowned analysis on the collapse of Enron, Professor Emeritus Colin Boyd pointed to the conflicts of interest created by the emergence of accountancies (accounting firms that also provide consulting services) in the latter part of the twentieth century. As he wrote:\n\n“An audit allowed an accounting firm to enter the client’s business, and to discover how the client’s various business systems operated. If the accounting firm tangentially detected aspects of the client’s systems that could be improved, then there would be an opportunity for the selling of consulting services to fix the client’s problems.”\n\nArthur Andersen was the accountancy firm at the center of the Enron case – and is largely to blame – because the lure of lucrative consultancies incentivized the firm to apply reckless standards to audits. In the wake of the fallout, the United States government has put milquetoast measures in place to prevent this from happening again. Already easily corruptible, there is no way anyone involved considered or cared whether single issue non-for-profits might come to abuse the accountancy way.\n\n\"Activities for the public benefit\" is a reporting standard, established by the UK, that ensures a charity is doing what it set out to do, and “is making a difference to its beneficiaries.” According to an annual return submitted in July of 2025, a ‘key initiative’ listed under the Valuable 500 Foundation’s ‘Activities for the Public Benefit’ is their Authentic Representation Tool which allows the Valuable 500 “to enter the client’s business, and to discover how the client’s various business systems operated. If the [Valuable 500] tangentially detected aspects of the client’s systems that could be improved, then there would be an opportunity for [recommending] consulting services to fix the client’s problems.”\n\nThe Authentic Representation Tool wasn’t the only item listed in ‘Activities for the Public Benefit.’ There was also a Reporting Accelerator Series and a Nothing Without Us Awards program. Like accountancies, the Valuable 500 Foundation conducts an audit of a corporation’s disability inclusion programming, which it uses to recommend consultation to \"fix\" areas where the client lacks. The Valuable 500 Foundation then takes this even further than accountancies ever did by catering best practices to reporting standards that renders their clients eligible for awards that will seal their reputation for inclusivity without ever having to account for complaints lodged by customers or employees.\n\nThese tools and initiatives aren’t just a breach of public trust, they are also extraordinarily expensive when considering the actual costs involved. The Valuable 500 has taken in millions upon millions of dollars that remain virtually unaccounted for. For instance, the Nothing About Us Awards announcement is listed as one of five key initiatives delivered under a £1.5 million foundation budget. But it happened on a stage at Cannes Lions and would have cost the Valuable 500 absolutely nothing. Similarly, Jonathan Kaufman’s white paper was another of the deliverables, but there were only “33 individuals from 30 companies who participated,” and typically corporate research subjects aren’t compensated, especially when the study is being conducted by a non-profit that their company is being burnished by.\n\nGeneration Valuable was listed as another deliverable, but the networking program places the onus on “seasoned executives” to carve out time for “upcoming disabled leaders, creating a dynamic, reciprocal mentoring partnership.” The Valuable 500 puts a cost of between £3,000-£6,000 on one to two Generation Valuable mentees, which corporations are expected to cover. It also assigned a ‘Delivery Partner’, ostensibly to facilitate ‘Learning Events’ and ‘Networking Opportunities’ and uses AI to provide accommodations. An interview with a former Generation Valuable participant does absolutely nothing to reveal any costs the Valuable 500 would have incurred.\n\nCuk and Barlet show how easy it is for large sums of money intended for the many to land in the pockets of those at the helm. It makes us wonder what Casey might mean when she says “there is no way forward in the battle for inclusion if we allow cancel culture to thrive and ignore people whose intentions are good but who might slip up every now and then.” To be clear, neither Cuk nor Barlet were canceled. They were simply found out and they are now both gainfully back at their grift. The formality of an audit, while informative, isn’t always needed to know what’s really going on – especially when fantastical childhood stories create a formula for fantastical charity stories.\n\nIn The Big Con: How the Consulting Industry Weakens Our Businesses, Infantilizes Our Governments, and Warps Our Economies, authors Mariana Mazzucato and Rosie Collington include “not-for-profit organizations around the world that provide consulting services” among the firms that often “have egregious conflicts of interest themselves.” In The Big Con, ”internal expertise often gets shunned in favor of contracting a global consultancy” because they are “selling legitimacy, not simply knowledge transfer.”\n\nThe Big Con is a hotbed for the Parasocial Model of Disability, which places capitalist frames of profit and growth above social transformation and world building. The Valuable 500 and other advocates for corporate disability inclusion have perfected a practice of masterfully executed ineffectiveness, granting hollowed-out corporations the freedom to do exactly what they want to do.\n\nTypically, as Mazzucato and Collington point out, most “employees do not know when consultants are at the table.” But because the legitimacy these organizations are selling is announced in press releases and other public materials, a simple search will reveal which organizations are undermining your grassroots, internal, worker-led advocacy. Only then can we begin to address the elephant rider in the board room.",

    "description": "Adapting to the different office etiquette, mealtime norms, and vacation days in France has been tough as someone from England, but I'm glad I moved.",
    "fullText": "In 2017, I quit my job as a paralegal, packed up my life in England, and bought a one-way ticket to Paris.\n\nThe new chapter was full of surprises, and though most of them were positive, I was in for some unexpected challenges in those early months — from navigating the notoriously tricky French bureaucracies (and supremely unhelpful bureaucrats operating them), to the weird and wonderful world of the Parisian soirée.\n\nHowever, the strongest culture shocks came in the workplace, and even now, after eight years in France, I still find aspects of French office culture surprising.\n\nGetting to grips with office etiquette was my first major challenge — and the most urgent to overcome. I was starting a completely new role, in a completely new company, barely three days after arriving in France.\n\nMy title was still paralegal, but even there, my remit couldn't have been more different. To say I had a steep learning curve ahead of me would be an almighty understatement.\n\nI had, at least, anticipated some difficulty addressing people correctly, but that didn't make my (frequent) blunders any less embarrassing.\n\nIn French, there are certain words for \"you\" and different versions of verbs depending on the level of politeness/deference needed. The rules around who you \"tu\" and who you \"vous\" feel nebulous at best — and a total minefield for a (foreign) new recruit.\n\nMeanwhile, social norms I wasn't expecting included greeting everyone who joins you in an elevator, and then wishing them a good day/evening when they/you leave. (People do this in medical waiting rooms here, too. I still haven't gotten used to it.)\n\nIn England, people mostly awkwardly avoid eye contact at all costs in these situations. And if you do accidentally acknowledge someone else's existence, at the very most, you offer them a tight (also awkward) smile.\n\nYou absolutely do not, under any circumstances, talk to them.\n\nIt didn't take me long to realize just how seriously the French take enjoying the enjoyment of mealtimes.\n\nEven my office cafeteria felt like a foodie's dream with a rotating menu of things like duck, salmon, and paella; desserts hand-crafted by a professional pastry chef; fresh bread from the local boulangerie; and literal mounds of cheese\n\nMy lunches were so heavily subsidised by my employer that, unless I wanted a three-course meal or a glass of wine (a girl's got to treat herself occasionally), they were almost always free.\n\nAnd, yes, it's apparently perfectly acceptable to have an alcoholic drink in the middle of the workday in France.\n\nI also quickly learned that mealtimes, like baguettes, are sacred in this country, both for socializing and for savoring.\n\nIt's frowned on to eat at your desk, scarfing down a sandwich while you work (I'm looking at you, England). Here, you sit down around a table, and you enjoy your food.\n\nAccordingly, a two-hour lunch break is also customary; The French are often baffled as to what you're supposed to do with \"only\" an hour.\n\nMy colleagues use their breaks to take or teach classes, exercise, or enjoy a leisurely meal in a restaurant — none of which had ever been possible with the 30 to 60 minutes I'd grown used to back home.\n\nRemember how I said it was acceptable to have a drink with lunch?\n\nApparently, it's also acceptable to have a drink before lunch, after lunch, and at essentially any time of the day, if there's even the smallest occasion to celebrate.\n\nI was served more champagne in my first two months in the office than I had been, cumulatively, in my entire life until that point.\n\nOne time, several bottles were opened for a colleague's going-away breakfast at 11:30 a.m. It was tough going, but I adapted to this particular culture shock as uncomplainingly as I could …\n\nAnother early discovery was that work-life balance is everything in France.\n\nThe culture of competition I'd experienced in England — the peculiar bragging over who was arriving at the office earliest and leaving latest (read: burning out fastest) — was completely absent.\n\nLeisure time feels ferociously protected here, to the extent that employees legally have the \"right to disconnect\" (ignore job-related calls and emails outside work hours) and the French are not shy about enforcing their rights.\n\nAdditionally, when I was informed of my vacation allowance, I was sure I must have mistranslated something: I had over five weeks of annual leave in my first year, and that's not including the 11 public holidays.\n\nIn France, workers are generally required to take at least two consecutive weeks' vacation. These breaks often falls between July and August, and swaths of employees disappear for an entire month.\n\nIt's quite a contrast to the situation I'd left behind in England, where taking two weeks' vacation in a row was considered a real extravagance. This is perhaps unsurprising, given I was never entitled to more than four weeks total annual leave.\n\nThat means everything pretty much grinds to a halt in the summer — pretty inconvenient when you're in the middle of a project and all your colleagues are OOO until September.\n\nBut it also opened my eyes to just how life-changing that kind of balance can be, and has been one of the most incredible parts of relocating to France.\n\nAdapting to such starkly different workplace norms from the ones I'd known in England has been a real roller-coaster ride — but there have definitely been plenty more ups than downs.\n\nUltimately, the experience has been as enjoyable as it has been surprising. Champagne, anyone?",

    "title": "19 reads for when Emily Henry's 'People We Meet on Vacation' gives you a book hangover",
    "description": "Netflix is releasing a film adaptation of Emily Henry's \"People We Meet on Vacation\" on January 9. Here's what to read after you watch.",
    "fullText": "One of the most highly anticipated book-to-screen adaptations of 2026 is undoubtedly \"People We Meet on Vacation\" by Emily Henry.\n\nHenry smashed onto the romance scene in 2020 with \"Beach Read\" and has written five more books since then, each of which has skyrocketed to The New York Times bestseller list.\n\nHenry's summer romance books often approach love with a sense of honesty and fun that the genre needs to thrive. Her characters may be enemies who find themselves living next door to each other or best friends who are scared to risk it all for something more, as is the case in \"People We Meet on Vacation,\" which has been turned into a film set to debut on Netflix on January 9.\n\nWhether you're already a fan of Henry or are just getting to know her work through the movie, \"People We Meet on Vacation\" will likely leave you wanting more. Here are other romance books that might help you fill the void.\n\n\"Book Lovers\" is Henry's third summer romance book, and it's both an epic love story and an ode to books themselves.\n\nNora Stephens doesn't think anything is missing in her life. She loves her job as a literary agent, her apartment in New York, and living near her sister, Libby, and her nieces.\n\nWhen Libby asks Nora to escape to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina, for a month, Nora can't say no, especially since Libby is several months pregnant at the time. Libby has big dreams of small-town romance for Nora during their getaway, but instead of finding a local man to have a fling with, Nora keeps running into Charlie Lastra, a grumpy New York editor she's never gotten along with.\n\nDespite their less-than-romantic history, Charlie and Nora keep crossing paths in Sunshine Falls, making the ever-growing list of things they have in common harder to ignore. And when Nora discovers her life as she knows it is about to change, Charlie might be the exact thing she needs.\n\nHenry is at her best in \"Happy Place,\" a novel that ruminates on what it means to fight for love.\n\nHarriet has spent her entire adult life loving Wyn. Their relationship consumes her, and the fact that she met him through her best friends, Sabrina and Cleo, only makes her love him more. Between Wyn and her friends, Harriet found the family she had always wanted in college, and she plans to spend her entire life with them.\n\nWhen Wyn abruptly breaks up with her after she starts her medical school residency, Harriet is heartbroken and terrified she's going to lose everyone she loves. She manages to avoid telling Sabrina and Cleo what happened for five months, planning to burst their bubble on their annual group trip to Maine.\n\nThen, Harriet is shocked to see Wyn when she arrives, and he informs her that they'll have to pretend to be a couple for the duration of the trip, as it's the last vacation the group will ever spend in the house they've loved for years. Harriet doesn't want to cause her friends pain, so she's willing to torture herself for a week.\n\nAll she has to do is stop herself from asking Wyn what went wrong for seven days, but as his displays of fake affection start to feel more and more real, Harriet might have to face her fear of rocking the boat if she wants a true chance at happiness.\n\nHenry's latest book, \"Great Big Beautiful Life,\" takes place in the summer and features a love story, but it marks a departure from her typical romances.\n\nJournalist Alice Scott is ready for the biggest challenge of her career to date: convincing the elusive heiress Margaret Ives to let her write her biography.\n\nSunny-dispositioned and thoughtful Alice is sure she can make Margaret comfortable enough to share the story of why she disappeared from public life years ago. However, when she arrives in Little Crescent Island, Georgia, to meet Margaret, she finds she'll be competing against Hayden Anderson, a grumpy and inconveniently handsome writer who happened to win a Pulitzer Prize for his last biography, to tell Margaret's story.\n\nBeating out Hayden for the role might be an uphill battle, but Alice isn't going down without a fight, even after she realizes Margaret is picking and choosing what she tells each of them after getting them to sign strict NDAs. And as they try to unweave Margaret's history, it will become more and more difficult for Alice and Hayden to ignore the heat between them.\n\nBolu Babalola's \"Honey & Spice\" doesn't feel like a debut novel, as she writes romantic chemistry with a deftness Henry herself may envy.\n\nKiki Banjo has made a name for herself at Whitewell University with her radio show \"Brown Sugar.\" She's staked her reputation on her ability to suss out players, warning her peers in the African-Caribbean Society against dating men who aren't worth their time.\n\nThen she risks it all by kissing Malakai Korede in front of everyone after writing him off as \"The Wastemen of Whitewell\" on her show. Kiki is terrified her show is going to slip through her grasp, so she makes a deal with Malakai to pretend to be a couple in the hopes that Kiki can save her show and Malakai can change his reputation on campus.\n\nKiki expects the duration of their fake romance to be torture, but as she and Malakai eat, study, and spend time together, she's unsettled to discover there seems to be more to him than meets the eye. Will Kiki be willing to let go of her preconceived notions for a chance at something real?\n\nLike Henry, Taylor Jenkins Reid is a master at writing about yearning and epic love, as is obvious in \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo.\"\n\nMonique Grant's career as a magazine writer is at a standstill when famous — and famously private — film star Evelyn Hugo says she wants to do a tell-all interview with Monique, and only Monique.\n\nMonique doesn't understand why Evelyn would want to work with her of all people, but she can't say no, especially when Evelyn starts opening up to her about her path to fame and the forbidden love that changed the course of her life. Monique feels like Evelyn has handed her the opportunity of a lifetime.\n\nWhen she finds out why Evelyn chose her for the tell-all, Monique will have to face truths about their shared history she never expected.\n\nIf you've already read Henry's \"Great Big Beautiful Life,\" you'll swoon for \"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo.\"\n\nLydia Bird's life is turned upside down when the love of her life, Freddie, dies in a car accident. After months of mourning and wanting to go back in time, Lydia begins to move on with the help of her sister and Freddie's best friend.\n\nThen she's given a way to return to her old life with Freddie, a life where the tragedy never occurred. Her heart is pulled in two directions as she struggles to choose between going back to the familiar and embracing the unknown, where someone new wants to love her.\n\nPoignant and fresh, Josie Silver's \"The Two Lives of Lydia Bird\" is a story of love and hope that strikes a similar tone to Henry's works.\n\nOn the night before Drew Nichols is set to be a groomsman in his ex-girlfriend's wedding, he gets stuck in an elevator with the pretty and funny Alexa Monroe, the first bright spot in what he believes will be an unbearable weekend.\n\nImpulse leads him to ask her to be his date to the wedding, and the duo surprises themselves by having more fun together than they bargained for. They plan to part ways after the wedding, neither interested in a long-distance relationship, but fate might have other plans for them.\n\nJasmine Guillory writes about romance with reverence and joy, making \"The Wedding Date\" an ideal read for Henry lovers.\n\nDannie Kohan's plan is on track. In one day, she performs well at the job interview of a lifetime and agrees to marry her long-term boyfriend. Then, when she goes to sleep that night, she wakes up five years in the future, with a different man beside her and his ring on her finger.\n\nDannie only has one hour in the future before she's yanked back to the present, and she tries to push aside the experience as a vivid dream. Then, she meets the man from her dream four and a half years later and discovers he's dating her best friend. Dannie will have to confront what she really wants and find out if she's willing to change her plans to find true happiness.\n\nRebecca Serle's \"In Five Years\" explores time, grief, and all-consuming love, both romantic and platonic, in the same way Henry's books do, challenging the reader to ask themselves how far they would go for true happiness.\n\nAlthough Sally Rooney's beloved \"Normal People\" has a darker tone than Henry's books, the protagonists, Connell and Marianne, have a chemistry and a years-long history that Henry fans will love.\n\nConnell and Marianne meet in high school, when Connell is a popular jock, and Marianne is, well, the opposite. The two bond despite their differences, setting them on a course that will shape their lives, drawing them back to one another over and over again.\n\nRooney's novel shows the inevitability of love, finding words for the often inexplicable reasons people need each other. You can also stream the Hulu series once you finish the book.\n\nLike Henry, Carley Fortune captures the angst and ecstasy of summer love in \"One Golden Summer.\"\n\nAlice can trace back her successful photography career to one photo: a candid shot of three teenagers on a bright yellow speedboat. She captured the shot during the one summer she spent at Barry's Bay with her Nan when she was 17, and it shifted the trajectory of her life.\n\nFifteen years later, Alice should be living her dream as a professional photographer, but six months after a breakup, she feels stuck and uninspired. When Nan breaks her hip, Alice thinks spending another summer at Barry's Bay might be good for them both.\n\nHer vision of a tranquil summer with her grandmother gets upended by Charlie Florek, one of the teens from Alice's famous photo. The glimpse of Charlie that she got across the lake all those years ago was intriguing, but adult Charlie is so devastatingly handsome and thoughtful that he almost scares Alice.\n\nAs they spend the summer together, Charlie heals wounds in Alice that she didn't know were there. If he lets her in, Alice might just do the same for Charlie.\n\nIlya Rozanov and Shane Hollander are supposed to hate each other. Not only have they been competing against each other in hockey since they were 18, but they're also total opposites. Canadian Shane is cautious and focused, while Russian wildcard Ilya isn't afraid to embrace his bad boy reputation on the ice.\n\nThey have one big thing in common, though: the secret hookups they can't seem to resist every time they see each other. If the world found out about their relationship, both Ilya and Shane's careers could be in jeopardy, but they may decide it's worth the risk for a chance at something real with each other.\n\nLike Henry's \"PWMOV,\" Rachel Reid's \"Heated Rivalry\" got adapted, though into a hit TV show instead of a movie, so you can stream the series if you want more from the characters when you finish the book.\n\nChristina Lauren has written dozens of books, but their 2018 novel \"Love & Other Words\" is perfect for fans of \"People We Meet on Vacation\" because of its dual timeline.\n\nMacy Sorensen has been white-knuckling her way through life for nearly a decade, but she's content with the safe world she's constructed for herself. A pediatric resident and newly engaged to a kind man who makes her feel mostly nothing, Macy thinks her heart is safe from the turmoil she experienced in her adolescence — until Elliot Petropoulos literally walks back into her life.\n\nMacy met Elliot as a teen shortly after her mother died, and he quickly became her center of gravity as she visited the small town he called home on weekends. Christina Lauren tells their story from the past and present, showing readers how they became fast friends over books and adolescent secrets, how they fell into life-changing love, and the wreckage they were both left with when it all fell apart.\n\nAfter 10 years of no contact, Macy may finally be ready to tell Elliot why she went radio silent on him after one fateful night. They'll both have to decide if they can move on from the pain of the past for a chance at a joy-filled future, together.\n\nAchingly romantic and surprisingly funny, \"The Seven Year Slip\" by Ashley Poston is about meeting the right person at the wrong time, literally.\n\nClementine West has been adrift since her beloved aunt died. She thought living in the Upper East Side apartment she inherited from her would make her feel closer to her, as the apartment's magic had always drawn her in. Instead, she feels like she's just waiting for her aunt to walk through the door.\n\nThen, Clementine comes home one day to a man she doesn't know standing in her kitchen. Except, he thinks the apartment is his, for the summer anyway. He exists seven years in the past, staying in the apartment over the summer while Clementine and her aunt were in Europe.\n\nClementine isn't ready to be hurt by love again, but she might not be able to keep up her defenses against the sweet chef staying the summer. And if she does let herself fall, will they work together if she finds him again in the now?\n\nJustin and Emma are having the same dating problem. Everyone they date meets their soulmate immediately after they break up with them.\n\nWhen Emma sees Justin's viral Reddit post about his problem, she reaches out, and they decide to go on a date with each other in the hopes of breaking their curse.\n\nEmma, a traveling nurse, plans to stay in Minnesota for the summer and enjoy a fling with Justin during her short stay. The last thing either expects is to get immediately attached, especially when they both have family members counting on them come fall.\n\nDespite their best-laid plans, Emma and Justin's curse might have been leading them to each other all along in \"Just for the Summer\" by Abby Jimenez.\n\nTo the world, romance novelist Eva Mercy and acclaimed literary author Shane Hall have nothing to do with each other. That's because the only two people who know their books are inspired by each other are Eva and Shane.\n\nFor their entire careers, Shane and Eva have been writing secret love letters to each other, as the week they spent as teens glued to each other's sides in a rush of love still haunts them both years later.\n\nThey finally come face-to-face again when they both speak on a Brooklyn literary panel, and despite the years since they've seen each other, their chemistry is undeniable. Eva doesn't trust Shane after the way things went down between them, though, and as a single mom, she can't risk getting hurt again.\n\nStill, Eva has always been curious to know why Shane disappeared, and reuniting with him might be the key to breaking her writer's block.\n\nThe second-chance romance in Tia Williams' \"Seven Days in June\" will hit the spot for Henry's fans.\n\nOf Ali Hazelwood's nine romance novels, the coming-of-age story and yearning in \"Deep End\" are most similar to the themes of \"People We Meet on Vacation.\"\n\nNearly every moment of Scarlett Vandermeer's life at Stanford is accounted for. She spends her days in the pool as a member of the diving team or studying, laser-focused on achieving her goal of getting into medical school.\n\nA relationship or even a fling is the last thing on Scarlett's mind. Then, she finds out Lukas Blomqvist, Stanford's world champion swim captain who thrives on control, has similar interests to her when it comes to intimacy, and she thinks she might be able to make time in her busy schedule for something casual.\n\nLukas and Scarlett agree to explore their attraction together, deciding not to tell almost anyone about their arrangement. Scarlett doesn't think keeping her relationship with Lukas to herself will be a problem until she realizes the last thing she feels about him is casual.\n\n\"Same Time Next Summer\" by Annabel Monaghan offers another take on second-chance romance.\n\nSam's family's beach house on Long Island was her happy place in her childhood. She spent every summer there, and she was never happier than she was with her toes in the sand. Then, at 17, Wyatt broke her heart, and Sam couldn't face a summer there without him. She hasn't been back for more than a long weekend since.\n\nAt 30, Sam is making the trek from the city back to the beach, and she isn't the girl she was at 17. She's determined to succeed at her high-powered job and plan the perfect wedding with her fiancé, Jack, whose tendency to over-schedule their lives has become a comfort.\n\nOnly when she arrives, Sam discovers that Wyatt has returned to the house next door, and the entire adult life she created for herself begins to crumble. As old feelings come rushing back, Sam will have to take stock of who she is, who she wants to be, and who she really wants to live her life with.\n\nWhen Phoebe Stone arrives at the Cornwall Inn in Rhode Island, she's dressed to the nines and doesn't intend to ever check out. Her plans immediately go awry, though, when she discovers the entire hotel has been rented out for a wedding, and the attendees immediately assume she's one of the wedding people.\n\nSoon, Phoebe has no choice but to participate in the wedding festivities, especially because she and the bride keep telling each other their darkest secrets.\n\nAfter months of depression, the fanfare and plot twist of a stranger's wedding might just show Phoebe her own path forward.\n\nSlightly more melancholy in tone than Henry's works but still beautifully romantic, \"The Wedding People\" by Alison Espach is about the surprises life can bring when you least expect it.",

    "fullText": "The captain of the Alaska Airlines plane that lost a panel midflight is suing Boeing, accusing it of trying to \"scapegoat\" the pilots.\n\nAttorneys for Brandon Fisher filed the lawsuit last Tuesday in an Oregon court, asking for $10 million in damages.\n\nBack in January 2024, Flight 1282 took off from Portland, bound for Ontario, California.\n\nBut at 16,000 feet, the Boeing 737 Max lost a door plug — a panel that covers a deactivated emergency exit.\n\nThe pilots declared an emergency and descended below 10,000 feet, so there was enough oxygen to breathe normally.\n\n\"But for Captain Fisher's heroism and immense display of composure under pressure, the outcome would have been catastrophic,\" the lawsuit said.\n\n\"Instead, Captain Fisher and First Officer [Emily] Wiprud executed a safe emergency landing despite chaotic conditions in the cockpit caused by the gaping hole in the left side of the aircraft.\"\n\nAn investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board later found that the plane had left Boeing's factory missing key bolts that would've secured the door plug.\n\nIt said that the fuselage arrived from the supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, with damaged rivets. Boeing workers removed the plug to repair them, but didn't put the bolts back in place, the NTSB found. This work wasn't properly documented, which also meant that there was no inspection that could've spotted the missing bolts, it said.\n\nSpirit AeroSystems is also named as a defendant in Fisher's suit. Boeing completed its acquisition of most of Spirit in December, with the aim of integrating its operations to gain greater control over its supply chain.\n\nFisher's suit said that, while defending a class-action lawsuit related to the incident, Boeing denied liability, saying its products were \"improperly maintained or misused by persons and/or entities other than Boeing.\"\n\n\"It was clear Boeing's words were directed at Captain Fisher in attempt to paint him as the scapegoat for Boeing's numerous failures,\" it said.\n\nThe suit says that Fisher suffered emotional distress as a result. \"Boeing's comments dramatically exacerbated the life-changing impacts that this incident caused Captain Fisher,\" it added.\n\nIn an internal memo, viewed by Business Insider, which was sent around shortly after the incident, the then-CEO of Boeing's commercial airplanes division, Stan Deal, told employees: \"We commend the pilots and cabin crew of Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 for their actions to safely land the plane.\"\n\nBoeing declined to comment when reached by Business Insider, citing the fact that the suit is pending litigation.\n\nAn Alaska Airlines spokesperson said, \"We have no comment on the lawsuit but remain grateful to our crewmembers for the bravery and quick thinking that they displayed on Flight 1282 in ensuring the safety of all on board.\"\n\nCorrection: January 6, 2025 — This post's headline has been amended. Brandon Fisher's lawsuit is against Boeing, not Alaska Airlines.",

    "title": "The 'Stranger Things' finale should have killed a main character",
    "description": "The \"Stranger Things\" series finale failed to deliver the bloodbath that many fans expected. Instead, the show played it way too safe.",
    "fullText": "\"Stranger Things\" began as a scrappy suburban mystery. It took its final bow as a franchise too big to commit to delivering real consequences to its characters.\n\nOver five seasons and nine years, \"Stranger Things\" has evolved from an '80s-set story about a small Indiana town reeling from the sudden disappearance of a local boy into Netflix's big-budget flagship show. The fifth and final season, which premiered on Nov. 26 and concluded on New Year's Eve, broke streaming records and led the platform to its biggest Christmas Day viewership of all time. It's the most-watched show in Netflix history, with over 1 billion all-time views.\n\nThus, the long-anticipated series finale was saddled with sky-high expectations. It's impossible to please everybody with a piece of art — especially an expectant audience of many millions, all with their own theories and favorite characters to root for — but creators and showrunners Matt and Ross Duffer were determined to try, ultimately to the show's detriment.\n\nThe series' two-hour finale episode, titled \"The Rightside Up,\" has a climax and conclusion that are weakened by conspicuous fan service, cheap thrills, and shoehorned happy endings for essentially all of its leads. It's the kind of CGI-fueled, character-stuffed spectacle one might expect from an \"Avengers\" film.\n\nGone are the shadowy threats and chill-inducing enigmas from seasons one and two. Instead, we get a dramatic chase sequence in a space desert and a fleshy super-monster that somehow takes mere minutes to subdue. In one scene, beloved babysitter Steve (Joe Keery) falls off a collapsing radio tower and momentarily seems to plummet to his death when the screen cuts to black. But when Steve reappears, he's been miraculously rescued by his frenemy, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton), in a scene obviously designed for theater applause (let's not forget the finale also premiered in select movie theaters across the country). Sitting at home witnessing the Marvel-ification of TV in real time, I could only laugh.\n\nTHE GASP HEARD IN EVERY DIMENSION pic.twitter.com/y3MJdxxWUm\n\nLike most fans of the show, I adore Steve, and I would have been gutted if he'd died. But I'd much rather be gutted than utterly unmoved, and nothing about that scene made me feel like Steve was actually in danger. He's had a near-death experience in every season, just so fans will cheer when he survives.\n\nI have to keep reminding myself that \"Stranger Things\" used to be a show with consequences, so I don't feel dumb for expecting to have felt something during the series' supersized conclusion.\n\nIn the series premiere, Will (Noah Schnapp) was kidnapped before the opening credits rolled. Later in the episode, Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) — a traumatized child who escaped from a government lab — watched the man who tried to help her get shot point-blank in the forehead. Two episodes later, another main character's best friend, Barb (Shannon Purser), was attacked and murdered by a faceless creature that walks on two legs.\n\nVecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) was intent on destroying the world, and he displayed a particular sadistic fixation on Eleven, her friends, and her family. He had magical psychic powers and could exploit private fears and weaknesses. And yet, in the end, Vecna's head was chopped off by Joyce (Winona Ryder), a normal middle-aged woman. His plan was thwarted by a group of literal children wielding guns and slingshots, all of whom made it back to our realm with hardly a scratch. Not even Max (Sadie Sink), who had her limbs snapped and her eyes gouged in season four, suffers lasting damage from her injuries.\n\nSince its inception, \"Stranger Things\" has boasted an array of lovable personalities, from Steve, Jonathan, Will, and Joyce to Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), Mike (Finn Wolfhard), and Nancy (Natalia Dyer). Any one of their deaths would have been emotional and poignant, while reminding us of the true dangers of the world of the show — but it also would have sparked controversy and discourse online. Allowing all the show's good guys to cross the finish line was the easiest way for the Duffers to pacify as many viewers as possible. It also stripped the finale of any sense of stakes or urgency.\n\nThe only controversy-courting decision the Duffers made — to allow Eleven to sacrifice herself to the Upside Down for the greater good — was undermined by intentional ambiguity. Eleven was the heart of \"Stranger Things\" and, as a character, she deserved to outlive Vecna. Still, her sacrifice made narrative sense: She had long been portrayed with an abnormal capacity for altruism, and she was determined to end the cycle of violence that her magic would always invite.\n\nHowever, much like Steve's, her \"death\" scene failed to induce panic. Even watching Eleven disappear as her friends cried and screamed her name — heart-wrenching performances all — I kept thinking to myself, \"This isn't real.\" The ground rule of \"Stranger Things\" is that if you don't see a dead body, that character isn't dead.\n\nNaturally, that's exactly the effect the Duffers intended. In the show's final moments, Mike posits a theory that Eleven staged an illusion and secretly escaped. The show cuts to clips of Eleven alive and well in Iceland, finally free from the threat of capture.\n\nThe audience is left to choose whether to believe Mike's story or not, though the show makes it clear which version the writers prefer. \"I believe,\" Mike, Will, Dustin, Lucas, and Max dutifully recite.",

    "title": "The garage where Jamie Siminoff founded Ring burned in the LA fires. Now he wants the doorbell cameras to help fight wildfires.",
    "description": "Jamie Siminoff's community, and the garage he founded Ring in, burned in the Palisades fire. Now he's teaming up with Watch Duty to fight wildfires.",
    "fullText": "Jamie Siminoff, the founder and CEO of Ring, looked out at a small patch of dirt. In January 2025, the garage that once stood there was wiped out by wildfires that tore through Los Angeles.\n\nIt was the site where he founded the video doorbell company over a decade ago.\n\n\"This looks like such a small pad where the garage was. It felt so big,\" Siminoff said, comparing it to returning to your childhood bedroom only to find it much smaller than you remembered.\n\n\"I was so proud of it as an office,\" Siminoff told me through tears, recalling the moment he discovered the garage had burned down.\n\nThe Pacific Palisades, a place Siminoff has called home with his wife and son for nearly two decades, still looks more like a construction zone than a neighborhood.\n\nFenced-in empty lots where buildings once stood now line part of the main drag on Sunset Boulevard. A troupe of food trucks and stands serves construction workers on their lunch breaks just outside the hardware store. Stores like CVS and Chipotle are adorned with large \"now open\" signs. Other businesses have yet to reopen.\n\nSiminoff recently took me on a tour of memories through the Palisades on his golf cart, pointing out where a school his son once attended had stood, the former site of a Gelson's grocery store, and a Ring camera affixed to a random front gate standing guard at a home that no longer exists.\n\nWe pulled down an alley and stopped at the former site of the small, detached garage that had burned down, the distinct smell of nearby eucalyptus trees contrasting sharply with the empty space. Siminoff founded Ring here in 2012 after realizing he couldn't hear the doorbell while working in the garage and kept missing package deliveries. Six years later, he sold it to Amazon for a reported $1 billion.\n\nOne year after fires tore through the Palisades and Altadena, Ring is teaming up with Watch Duty, the nonprofit that became a lifeline to Angelenos seeking updates during the fires, in the hope that its doorbell cameras can help fight future wildfires. The new feature, announced Tuesday, will alert users when there's a fire in their area and use AI to identify signs of fire caught on Ring cameras. Ring users can also opt in to sharing images from their cameras with Watch Duty, which can then share relevant updates with the public.\n\n\"Over 10,000 Ring cameras were in the burn zone, and one of the biggest problems was not knowing,\" Siminoff said of the confusion during the Palisades fire.\n\nSiminoff moved out of the home he founded Ring from and into another in the area in 2017, but the place remained special to him.\n\nHe left Ring in 2023, but shortly after the fires in January 2025, he posted on Instagram: \"In that garage I created something that impacted crime. Now I sit here wondering if I could do the same with fire…\"\n\nLess than three months later, he was back at Ring as CEO, having written a lengthy email to Amazon leadership, including CEO Andy Jassy and founder Jeff Bezos.\n\n\"It's a big part of why I went back,\" Siminoff told me.\n\nSiminoff was out of town when the fire first broke out in the Palisades. When he returned, he went straight into the evacuation zone and found the back of his home on fire. He and a friend put it out with his hose. Siminoff and other neighbors continued to patrol the neighborhood, collecting stray fire extinguishers and making triage decisions about which blazes to tackle. He described the experience as chaotic and surreal, like being in the \"fog of war.\"\n\n\"Once you're there, you realize you're not looking for fire — you're looking for what's going to become fire,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, he and thousands of others were turning to Watch Duty. The app provides real-time wildfire maps and alerts by monitoring various sources, including radio scanners, official government updates, and a network of mountain-top cameras.\n\nJohn Mills, cofounder and CEO of Watch Duty, told me the app was inundated with new users and traffic during the Los Angeles fires, handling \"100,000 requests a second.\" For the Watch Duty team, he said it was \"all hands on deck.\"\n\n\"No one was sleeping very well for at least a month,\" he said. \"It was utter mayhem.\"\n\nMills said Watch Duty consists of 50 paid staff members and about 250 volunteers, many of whom are active and retired firefighters, dispatchers, and first responders. He said the public often doesn't understand how fires are fought and just how necessary quick and accurate information is in those moments.\n\n\"In these wind-driven fire events, these fires are starting miles ahead of the flame front because embers, the size of footballs sometimes, are getting tossed miles in advance,\" Mills said.\n\nWhile mountaintop cameras can help spot smoke plumes, they often miss what's happening at street level, especially in canyons or hilly neighborhoods like the Palisades. \"If we don't know what's happening, we're going to be slower to respond,\" he said.\n\nThat's where he said Ring can help fill in some gaps. The new feature, called Fire Watch, will provide Ring users with real-time fire alerts when Watch Duty identifies a wildfire in their area. For Ring Protect subscribers, their outdoor cameras will automatically analyze the video to detect smoke and fires using AI, and then alert owners so they can assess the situation at their home.\n\nUsers inside the wildfire alert zone can also choose to share images from their doorbell cameras with Watch Duty. The nonprofit will then review and moderate the submissions before sharing relevant updates publicly, helping create a clearer picture of how fires are spreading on the ground.\n\nAs part of the partnership, Ring is also donating $1 million to Watch Duty.\n\nRing and Watch Duty said the system would not automatically access users' cameras but alert them when there's a fire emergency and ask if they want to help with providing data. Siminoff said that most people would not want to grant access to their data all the time, but he thinks many would opt in to help during a specific emergency.\n\n\"We're not a Big Brother organization,\" Mills said. \"We're a bunch of citizens trying to solve a problem that frankly should have been solved a long time ago.\"\n\nSiminoff said he has always had a vision for Ring that involves making communities safer, and that this is just another step toward that larger goal. While it may not stop a fire from igniting, he thinks that using Ring cameras could help fill the information gap that made it so hard for first responders and citizens like him to know where to direct their efforts while fighting the fire.\n\n​​\"Maybe actually, it wasn't just a resource issue. Maybe it was an information issue,\" he said.\n\nIn the Palisades, Siminoff noted the sporadic and unpredictable nature of the fire's destruction, with some homes destroyed while their neighbors' remained fully intact. He regularly visits the old garage, and was relieved to find that the house it belonged to was still standing and in the process of being repaired on the day we visited.\n\n\"I've definitely come up here and cried many times, including today,\" he said, adding that he always thought he might buy the garage back someday and perhaps turn it into a little museum.\n\nWhile it will take years for the Palisades to rebuild, Siminoff said that saving even one home would make the partnership with Watch Duty worthwhile.\n\n\"If you could have stopped one house from burning down, that's a family.\"",

    "description": "The two attacks mark Ukraine's latest deep strikes as it continues to target Russia's weapons and its vast energy sector.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian forces used long-range, deep-strike drones to hit a Russian missile arsenal and oil depot supporting the invasion, a security official told Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nThe attacks mark Ukraine's latest deep strikes as it continues to target Russian weapons and the country's vast energy sector, a major revenue source for the state as it wages war.\n\nA source in the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBU, said that drones hit Russia's 100th Main Missile and Artillery Directorate (GRAU) in the western Kostroma region. They were only authorized to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss military developments.\n\nThe drone attack on the facility triggered a secondary detonation of ammunition, causing powerful blasts at the facility, the source said, calling it an important target because Russia uses it to supply munitions to smaller sites in other areas of the country.\n\nThe source said drones also struck an oil depot in the nearby Lipetsk region, sparking an \"intense\" blaze. Video footage and images shared on social media appeared to show fire and smoke at the two facilities.\n\nOvernight, Ukrainian attack drones successfully hit a Russian oil depot in the town of Usman, Lipetsk Oblast. Seen here, flames leap into the night sky from the burning facility. pic.twitter.com/EN6SRI2sXU\n\nRussia's defense ministry said on Tuesday that it shot down 360 Ukrainian drones without specifying where. Neither the ministry nor the Russian embassy in the US responded to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nThe SBU source said that the two drone attacks were carried out by its Alpha group, an elite \"spetsnaz\" unit considered to be among the best of Ukraine's special forces.\n\nThe Alpha group regularly carries out long-range drone attacks against Russian targets, including a recent first-of-its-kind strike on a Moscow-linked oil tanker in the Mediterranean Sea and the stunning June attacks against Russian airbases, known as Operation Spiderweb.\n\nThe SBU's Alpha forces also carry out ground operations; for instance, they have participated in Ukraine's defense of Pokrovsk, the war-torn city in the eastern Donetsk region that has been the site of some of the conflict's most intense fighting.\n\n\"In the New Year, the SBU continues to work successfully on military and oil facilities of the Russian Federation, reducing the enemy's ability to provide their army with ammunition and fuel,\" the source said in translated remarks shared with Business Insider.\n\n\"All Russian rear facilities that work for the war against Ukraine are absolutely legitimate targets,\" they added.\n\nSince August, Ukraine has stepped up its use of long-range drones to attack Russian energy facilities in a bid to put pressure on a key source of revenue for Moscow that helps fuel its war efforts.\n\nUkraine has mostly targeted oil and gas infrastructure on land, such as depots and ports, but in recent weeks, it has expanded attacks to maritime targets, striking several oil tankers and oil platforms in the Black, Caspian, and Mediterranean seas.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the deep-strike operations as the country's way of imposing \"long-range\" sanctions on Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, Tuesday's attack on the 100th GRAU arsenal reflects a tactic that Ukraine has long relied on — hitting ammunition storage sites inside Russia to cause more near-term battlefield impacts.",

    "title": "James Cameron has more billion-dollar movies than Spielberg or Nolan. Why isn't he in the same breath?",
    "description": "James Cameron now has four movies that have made over $1 billion at the box office, more than another other filmmaker. Why don't we respect him more?",
    "fullText": "In an era where it's nearly impossible to get people to pause their daily lives, put down their devices, and visit a movie theater, James Cameron has defied the odds and given the movie business hope that not all is lost.\n\nOver the weekend, Cameron's latest epic, \"Avatar: Fire & Ash,\" crossed the $1 billion milestone at the worldwide box office. For any filmmaker, it's an incredible feat: In Hollywood history, only 58 movies have crossed $1 billion at the box office. James Cameron has done it four times.\n\nSo, why is it that, despite having more hits than Steven Spielberg and Christopher Nolan, we don't consider him one of today's greatest directors?\n\nCameron's first taste of the six-zero club was in 1997 when his iconic love story \"Titanic\" hit the milestone and went on to become the highest-grossing movie of all time for over a decade. That lasted until Cameron himself dethroned it with \"Avatar\" in 2009. That not only earned $1 billion, but is the current highest-grossing movie of all time. Since then, sequels \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" (2022) and \"Avatar: Fire & Ash\" (2025) have crossed $1 billion.\n\nCameron's four-peat breaks a tie he had with Anthony and Joe Russo, who have three billion-dollar-plus earners with \"Captain America: Civil War (2016), \"Avengers: Infinity War\" (2018), and \"Avengers: Endgame\" (2019).\n\nMeanwhile, filmmakers who have two titles that have hit a billion include the likes of Nolan (2008's \"The Dark Knight,\" 2012's \"The Dark Knight Rises\"), Peter Jackson (2003's \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,\" 2012's \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey), and Michael Bay (2011's \"Transformers: Dark of the Moon,\" 2014's \"Transformers: Age of Extinction\").\n\nWhat all these filmmakers outside of Cameron have in common is that their movies earned their billions working with established IP that has been ingrained in pop culture for generations. Cameron, meanwhile, crafted original stories (spoiler: yes, the Titanic did sink, but the Jack and Rose love story is pure fiction).\n\nThat's not to take anything away from the above filmmakers, who told entertaining stories that clearly grabbed the attention of audiences all over the world (and the filmmaking team of Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, who have made two movies to earn a billion each that weren't from IP: 2013's \"Frozen\" and 2019's \"Frozen II\"). But Cameron has done the equivalent of winning the movie Super Bowl four times. Doesn't he belong in the ranks of the greatest living directors?\n\nJames Cameron gave us \"The Terminator\" franchise, one of the greatest sequels of all time with 1986's \"Aliens\" (a feat he repeated with 1991's \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\"), and one of the greatest underwater sci-fi thrillers with 1989's \"The Abyss.\" His entire filmography is made up of classics (yes, even Arnold Schwarzenegger's spy movie \"True Lies\").\n\nSo why don't we put more respect on his name?\n\nYou can't say it's because he doesn't have an Oscar; he won best director for \"Titanic.\" And it's certainly not because he doesn't put butts in seats. But for some reason, Cameron's name doesn't come after you say Spielberg, Coppola, and Scorsese. Heck, you might even think of Nolan or Ryan Coogler before you think of Cameron as one of the greats.\n\nPerhaps it's because he doesn't have the cinematic eye of a Brian DePalma or can feed off the social consciousness like a Spike Lee. It could be because he's lived in the science fiction world most of his career, a genre that leads to box office bucks (hi, George Lucas) but not auteur status.\n\nRegardless, we go to see his movies. Whether it's because he pushes the envelope in the visual technology or, dare I say, because he's a great storyteller, the box office receipts show he's inspired millions to go see his work.\n\nAt the end of the day, that's all any filmmaker can ask for: that people to want to go see what they came up with. But in a time in Hollywood when fewer creatives are taking risks to tell personal stories and must instead take on the next \"sure thing\" IP to keep their careers afloat, we should show much more gratitude that James Cameron is still working.",

    "description": "I took a cruise to Alaska on the Disney Wonder. From the excursions to the sightseeing on board, the trip was unforgettable and definitely worth it.",
    "fullText": "As a frequent traveler, I've sailed with several different cruise lines on itineraries throughout the Caribbean, Northern Europe, and the Mediterranean. But out of everywhere I've been, my favorite vacation was an eight-night sailing on board the Disney Wonder to Alaska.\n\nAs someone who loves to vacation in warm and relaxing places, I wasn't expecting my sailing to Alaska to top the list of my all-time favorite trips, but I loved the itinerary and was happy to swap my frozen drink for some hot cocoa.\n\nHere's why it was such a standout trip.\n\nAlthough I typically like to splurge on a room with a veranda on cruises, I was especially glad I did so on this trip. There wasn't any shortage of activities on board, but our favorite thing to do was grab our binoculars and sit out on our balcony.\n\nWe were able to see whales and porpoises swimming alongside the ship, as well as eagles flying above us and nestled in the trees alongside the shore — all from the comfort of our room.\n\nWe didn't end up booking any formal whale watching excursions, but we felt like we had seen so much wildlife on the cruise itself that we didn't regret passing on it.\n\nOur cruise offered a unique option on the day that we sailed to the Stikine Icecap: the chance to board a smaller boat to take you even closer to the glacier.\n\nThe excursion was pricey at about $300 per person, and I was unsure if it would be worth it. But given I wasn't sure when — or if — we'd ever be back in Alaska, I decided to risk it. I'm so glad I did because it ended up being the highlight of our trip.\n\nOur explorer boat got closer to the glacier than the ship, and we also got to cruise around the fjord for about three hours, giving us great views of misty waterfalls, eagles, and mountains.\n\nIt feels like almost everyone you talk to on a cruise has one non-negotiable shore excursion. For me, it was riding the White Pass Scenic Railway in Skagway.\n\nThe railroad was built during the Klondike Gold Rush over the course of two years and has been in operation since 1900.\n\nIt's a steep climb through the mountains, and the roughly three-hour ride offered amazing views from inside the train car, as well as the open-air viewing platforms between cars.\n\nThere are some things I think Disney Cruise Line excels at, like great food, amazing hospitality, and small touches that make a trip feel really special.\n\nAlthough every sailing I've had with Disney has been excellent, this one truly stood out for all of the extra touches. For example, there was always complimentary hot cocoa waiting for us upon returning from the port, or on deck during the glacier viewing. There were even stacks of fleece blankets in case we got too cold.\n\nPlus, for one day of the sailing, the Disney characters wear exclusive costumes only seen on board Alaska voyages.\n\nAlthough I've been on over a dozen cruises, I know I'll never forget my journey to Alaska.\n\nIt was so special to be able to hike next to a glacier, dig into a pile of king crab legs, and ride through mountain passages on a train. Plus, when we got back on the ship, we got to experience all the storytelling and special touches that Disney is known for.\n\nOverall, I really loved this itinerary and wouldn't hesitate to save up for another sailing in the future.",

    "description": "Yasmin Santos left Meta to start Altar Native, an herbal alcohol alternative. Her products are taking off among sober-curious and stressed execs.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Yasmin Santos, a former Meta ad specialist and the founder of the herbal alcohol alternative brand Altar Native. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I stopped drinking in 2018, it was for my health, not my career. It turned out to be great for both.\n\nI gave up alcohol to heal a gut issue, thinking it would just be temporary. But when I was finally healthy enough to drink again, I realized something had shifted. My body no longer wanted it. The buzz wasn't fun; it just felt wrong.\n\nStill, I missed the ritual. I missed the ease alcohol could bring in social settings. At the same time, I was caring for my mother, who was bedridden with early-onset dementia. I could see how much pain she was in, and how the pharmaceuticals she relied on often did more harm than good. I prayed for another way and felt a clear answer: \"The plants are there for you.\"\n\nThat's when I discovered herbalism — and the vast world of plants that humans have used for thousands of years to support their well-being. I learned about kava, CBD, kratom, and damiana — each with different properties that our ancestors used to calm, energize, or restore balance. It was like opening a door into a forgotten world of natural solutions.\n\nI'd bring little dropper bottles to social gatherings, letting friends try my blends. The response was overwhelming. People wanted to know where they could buy them. That was in 2021, and the spark became my company, Altar Native.\n\nThrough 2022, I refined the branding and recipes, and by January 2024, we were officially launched. I started small, still freelancing in marketing to fund the business, and using an $11,000 inheritance from my mom as seed money.\n\nBefore I started selling the tinctures themselves, I'd tested the idea with a \"cater bar\" — a mobile alcohol-free bar I could take to festivals and private events. It helped me prove the concept and reach my first customers. Between the events and tincture sales, I've had a 115% growth rate in the year since, and I'm projecting that I'll reach months with six-figure sales in the next few years.\n\nWhat has surprised me most is our customer base. I thought my audience would be \"wellness girlies\" who are into yoga and Pilates. But our biggest fans turned out to be van lifers, surfers, climbers, and outdoor adventurers; the sort of people who want to connect deeply to nature and stay clear-headed doing it.\n\nOur second demographic emerged unexpectedly: professional men, aged 40 to 55, often high-level business professionals. They order our \"Adapt\" blend, which helps regulate cortisol and balance energy.\n\nThey don't want alcohol, but they still want something to take the edge off — and since I come from the same corporate background, I get it, and I know exactly how to create what they're looking for.\n\nWe're riding a wave. Since the pandemic, people have woken up to the reality that how they care for their bodies defines their quality of life. They're drinking less, questioning what they put in their systems, and searching for alternatives that help them feel good without dulling their senses.\n\nThat's where I see Altar Native: at the intersection of wellness and ritual, bridging ancient plant wisdom with modern life. I call it \"herbal mixology\": the art of crafting functional, plant-based blends that elevate your mood and state of mind, without the use of alcohol.\n\nOur tinctures can be mixed into mocktails, added to tea or sparkling water, or taken straight on the tongue. My personal routine includes our \"Ecstatic\" blend in the morning with cacao instead of coffee to keep me focused without the afternoon crash. I take \"Adapt\" throughout the day when I need balance, and \"Lucid\" at night to calm my nerves and stave off anxiety.\n\nI haven't taken on investors yet. I've bootstrapped everything — through Meta income, freelancing, and careful reinvestment. My goal is to scale sustainably, eventually moving into ready-to-drink (RTD) beverages while staying true to our values of intentionality and environmental stewardship.\n\nMy co-manufacturer in Pennsylvania handles extraction, bottling, labeling, and fulfillment — allowing me to focus on building the brand.\n\nI'd love to grow Altar Native into a major player in this space, and maybe even exit one day, if it means partnering with a company that shares our vision for conscious, plant-based living.\n\nI was in a sorority in college, and each graduating senior was given a paper plate superlative award based on their personality and habits. Mine was \"Most likely to sell a million-dollar business to 'Shark Tank.'\" We'll see!\n\nBut for now, I'm focused on being a steward of this idea: helping it grow, and helping others find natural ways to reconnect with themselves.\n\nBecause for me, this isn't just about business. It's about remembering what the earth has always offered us — and choosing to listen.",

    "description": "After my family moved, my two kids, 9 and 11, are growing up far from their cousins. It's caused me to redefine family.",
    "fullText": "When my wife and I moved over 600 kilometers (nearly 400 miles) away from our family and friends in 2017, that choice put a lot of distance between our new life and the life we'd built up until that point.\n\nWhat I hadn't fully considered was what that distance would mean for our kids — now 9 and 11 — and their relationships with their cousins.\n\nMy brother and his family now live far away, and instead of being part of each other's daily lives, my kids and their cousins now see each other only a few times a year. Although we only lived near my brother during the first two years of my daughter's life, she and my brother's son, who is just one year older than she is, were joined at the hip. My brother also has a daughter who is my son's age; they were both just under a year old when we moved. These relationships are especially meaningful to my kids as these are the only two cousins they have.\n\nNow, there are no impromptu sleepovers or family dinners on Sundays, and this absence has shaped how my kids understand family, belonging, and connection.\n\nWhen my wife and I grew up in the 90s, cousins were just a part of life — at least, they were for both of us. At our holidays and family gatherings, they were our default playmates — we didn't have to try to build relationships with them or tell our family history, because those things were already understood.\n\nMy kids don't have that. They know their cousins, but those relationships are episodic. They pick up where they left off during visits, then go months without seeing each other. We see each other twice a year, usually in the summer and again in the fall. It's a long drive, and driving conditions in the winter make it hard to spend time together during the holiday season. It's no one's fault, it's just geography, but it's different from my childhood.\n\nSometimes, my kids experience sadness and a sense that they're missing something they can't quite name. My kids don't always say it directly, but they'll ask why we can't see their cousins more often, or comment on how fast the visit went by. Occasionally, they'll ask if they can FaceTime them or send a message, as a way of holding on to the connection a little longer.\n\nBut there's also an adaptability I admire in how my kids accept this as normal and have started defining family in their own terms.\n\nBecause their cousins aren't around, friendships have taken on a different weight in my kids' lives.\n\nThough they're young, I already see them investing deeply in their friendships; from my vantage point, it doesn't feel as though they treat their friends as interchangeable or temporary. My daughter spends hours making jewelry or macramé projects for her friends, and my son plays with the same group of kids on our street almost every day.\n\nI've watched them build relationships that look a lot like what their bonds with their cousins might have been like had we lived closer; these are friends they spend entire afternoons with, friends they feel comfortable disagreeing with, and friends who clearly belong to their inner circle.\n\nLiving in a small town has helped. Our town is the kind of place where kids run into the same people over and over, whether it's at school, the beach, the skate park, the grocery store, or on the ski hill. Familiarity builds quickly here, and friendships don't stay superficial for long.\n\nRaising kids without cousins nearby has forced me to rethink what family truly means.I used to think of family as something fixed: a network defined by blood and proximity. But watching my kids grow up this way has shown me that family can also be something you actively build through consistency, trust, and shared time rather than through genetics alone.\n\nThat said, the absence still stings sometimes. There are times (holidays especially) when I feel the gap. When I imagine how loud and chaotic things might be if cousins were nearby, and how full the house would feel. And I'm not sure whether my kids will wish they had the type of childhood I'd had when they're older, or whether they'll barely think about it at all.\n\nHowever, there's something grounding about the version of family my kids are learning. They're coming to understand that relationships take effort, that closeness with others isn't automatic, and that people become important through consistency and care — not just because you share a last name.",

    "description": "\"Beast Games\" co-creator Sean Klitzner spoke to Business Insider about what goes into making a large-scale unscripted competition show.",
    "fullText": "YouTuber MrBeast is all about one-upping himself with bigger and bolder videos.\n\nThat approach is at the core of the second season of \"Beast Games,\" MrBeast's Amazon Prime Video show that returns to TV screens this week.\n\n\"We took everything from season one — all of the learnings from creative to production — we put it all on a wall, and every single day we just set out to make it better, which is the nature of the brand,\" Sean Klitzner, one of the show's co-creators and showrunners, told Business Insider.\n\nThe second season will pit 100 \"strong\" and 100 \"smart\" contestants against each other in a series of challenges as they vie for over $10 million in prizes.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with Klitzner about filming the new season, as well as his experience working at MrBeast's company, Beast Industries, which he left in October.\n\nKlitzner said a big focus for \"Beast Games\" season two was meeting the team's creative goals without blowing through its budget and shooting requirements.\n\nThe first season of \"Beast Games\" was massive, drawing in 50 million viewers in just 25 days, according to Amazon. But it was also a money drain for MrBeast. The YouTuber, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, said making the first season of \"Beast Games\" lost his company tens of millions of dollars. Beast Industries has been on a broader push to turn its media business profitable in recent months.\n\nFor season two, the goal was \"balancing the budget and the creative to make sure that we don't lose the virality,\" Klitzner said. \"Every day I had the spreadsheets up.\"\n\nKlitzner said contingency planning was also a major focus for the show's second season. The first season encountered a variety of problems, including a crew-member injury, complaints about access to food and medical care during preliminary filming in Las Vegas, and torrential rain while shooting in Toronto.\n\nKlitzner said he worked closely with co-creator Tyler Conklin and the team on brainstorming ideas, and that his role on set and in preproduction was helping to make sure Donaldson and Conklin's creative vision came to life by anticipating problems before they happened.\n\nHe said he would do multiple set walkthroughs to catch details that might draw concern, asking questions like:\n\nThe team also decided to film part of the second season in Greenville, North Carolina, where the MrBeast creative team is based. The company received a $15 million film and entertainment grant from the state to shoot there.\n\nFilming in Greenville \"made things much easier, especially when you get to sleep in your own bed,\" Klitzner said.\n\nPulling off \"Beast Games,\" with its record-breaking scale, involved \"over 1,000,000 hours of hard work spread between thousands of people,\" Donaldson wrote on X (formerly Twitter). Conklin was the \"creative filter\" for the show, Klitzner said. Other key contributors included fellow showrunner Matt Apps, co-creator Mack Hopkins, executive producer Mike Miller, and a long list of other creatives.\n\nUnlike on a traditional Hollywood set, MrBeast staffers are used to wearing many hats, and that expertise translated to the set, Klitzner said.\n\n\"Take full ownership of your episode or of your scene or of whatever, by understanding every aspect of it,\" Klitzner said. \"I want you to know about camera. I want you to know about every aspect of things.\"\n\nKlitzner joined MrBeast in April 2022 after seeing the YouTuber's post on X that he was looking to hire \"a super creative, YouTube nerd.\"\n\nAfter seeing that post and applying, Klitzner said he scored an interview with Conklin, MrBeast's creative lead, who invited him out to the team's Greenville headquarters to work for a 90-day test period, known as a vibe check.\n\nKlitzner started at the company as a creative working on MrBeast's YouTube channel. His first video as lead producer involved a paid assassin chasing after the YouTuber. It was published in March 2023 and has pulled in over 300 million views to date.\n\nThe executive worked his way up at Beast Industries, overseeing its YouTube shorts strategy for a few months and helping to produce content for MrBeast's chocolate brand Feastables. He later served as Donaldson's chief of staff for about a month, before being brought on to help make \"Beast Games.\"\n\nAfter leaving MrBeast, Klitzner said he would love to work with a streamer like Netflix or Amazon that is interested in an unscripted series.\n\nHis biggest takeaway from working at MrBeast? Fight through your imposter syndrome, and you'll discover you're capable of pulling off a lot.\n\nThe opportunities Klitzner had to \"showcase what I could do have changed my life,\" he said. \"I don't feel like an imposter anymore.\"",

    "fullText": "My partner was my first relationship and first love. I thought he would remain simply \"first,\" but we're happily in love nine years later.\n\nYet, there's one big milestone that we haven't reached: our first time living together. Unlike most couples, we've never shared a space for more than a few weeks.\n\nPeople are always shocked when they hear how long we've been together. The first question they usually ask is, \"Why hasn't he proposed yet?\" Their eyes widen even more when they find out I'm not going home to him.\n\nWe feel great about our living dynamic, though: Living apart has helped us maintain the same spark at 27 that we had when we met at 19.\n\nWe met in our first year of college, when we both lived on campus but in different accommodations.\n\nWhen we moved back home at 21, three years into the relationship, we continued living apart for practical reasons. Our goal was to live with our families until we saved up enough money to buy a more permanent home.\n\nAt first, I missed my partner a lot, and living with my parents felt a bit claustrophobic. After the initial adjustment, though, I began feeling happier than ever.\n\nMy family and I have always been close, but staying with them as adults made us cherish each other even more. The dynamic started to feel great for my romantic relationship, too: We realized that living apart helped us date with more intention.\n\nMy partner and I would — and still do — schedule regular dates, prioritizing novelty and adventure. We'd splurge on special nights out each month and meet up for weekly creative activities, like painting and cooking.\n\nSince our time together is limited, even ordinary things like driving home feel sacred. Our independence keeps a steady drip of excitement into our partnership, and we don't take each other's presence for granted.\n\nSix years into our relationship, we were almost ready to move in together. Then, my family life abruptly changed, and our circumstances shifted again.\n\nWhen my dad unexpectedly died four years after I moved back home, I had a new perspective on my choice to live with my parents after college.\n\nI was angry at the world for cutting my time with him short, but my one salvation was all the time that we had spent together. If I had moved out after college, like I originally wanted, I never would have had these extra four years with my dad.\n\nNow, it's been one year since I lost him. Living with my mom and sister, and leaning on them for support, has been bittersweet but invaluable — even if it means my plans to move in with my partner are once again on the back burner.\n\nNow, I've finally saved up enough to buy a home, but I'm still not sure if it'll be the place I share with my partner.\n\nI've developed a different dream — securing a place for my mom and sister. My partner even suggested moving in with us and living as a unit to help us navigate our newfound fear of loss.\n\nSome may say we're delaying the inevitable, or that we can't know if we'll last if we don't live together.\n\nTo that, I always say that cohabiting just doesn't fit our lives yet. Life is as full of uncertainties as it is short. I found this out the hard way with my father.\n\nNot only are we grateful to have nice places to live with our families as we wait for the right time to move in together, but by letting go of expectations, we're still in the \"honeymoon stage\" almost a decade into our relationship.\n\nOne day, we plan to live together, get married, and start a family. For now, though, we're building a partnership that keeps us close to both each other and the people we love.",

    "fullText": "A number of tech leaders have weighed in on how the entry-level software engineering space is changing — and now Blackstone CTO John Stecher is sharing his take.\n\n\"There definitively is a shift,\" Stecher told Business Insider.\n\nThe CTO, who graduated with a computer science degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2001, said the software engineering landscape looked \"totally different\" back then. In the 2000s, he said the field had a reputation for being an \"ultra-nerdy\" career path for \"super introverted people,\" which he considered himself to be at the time.\n\nHe said he remembers \"busting out books\" and having to read about how to write code.\n\n\"Now you just Google it, or you can ask Claude how to do it,\" Stecher said.\n\nStecher said the computer science major has grown significantly since he graduated in 2001. In fall 2025, the University of Wisconsin-Madison said roughly 2,500 students enrolled in computer science, compared to about 260 in 2001.\n\n\"It's now a job people want,\" Stecher said.\n\nAccording to the National Center for Education Statistics, the number of computer and information science bachelor's degrees conferred in the 2021-2022 academic year — the most recent year available — was up 115% from two decades earlier.\n\nWhile some computer-science programs have seen a decline in recent years as job security concerns arise, the major is significantly more mainstream than it once was, and that means there's more competition for jobs.\n\nStecher said the early-career engineers he now works with have \"insane skill sets.\"\n\n\"I'm blown away every year,\" Stecher said. \"There is no way in hell I would have gotten a job. When I look at the skills that some of these people today have, it's completely different than who I was.\"\n\nStecher said that while the core technical skills needed to succeed in the role haven't changed, it's more difficult for entry-level engineers to gain hands-on experience to expand those skills.\n\n\"You need a good mentorship and apprenticeship program,\" Stecher said. \"That's one thing that I think has shifted over the years.\"\n\nIn the past, companies would ask new engineering hires to write functional tests that required them to start understanding and owning code in a specific component of a larger system. Now that coding tools can automate a large number of basic tasks, you have to find other ways to instill knowledge in new hires, Stecher said.\n\n\"A lot of the AI tooling can do that for you,\" Stecher said.\n\nStecher said Blackstone has rolled out a \"buddy system\" that pairs entry-level engineers with more experienced colleagues.\n\nAs tools take on more of the coding work, companies are increasingly looking for engineers who can break down logical problems and know how to use new tools — as well as question when those tools aren't providing the correct answers. The buddy system, he said, helps early-career engineers learn when AI is getting it right and when it isn't.\n\n\"That is a very important skill set that people need to pick up and work with,\" Stecher said.",

    "fullText": "A former producer for the syndicated CBS news program \"Inside Edition\" has sued Paramount Global, claiming he was fired after complaining about repeated antisemitic comments by senior talent.\n\nJoshua Bernstein said Lisa Guerrero, then a correspondent on the program, called him a \"whiny Jew,\" \"spoiled Jew,\" and an \"old Jewish woman\" and asked how he could have married a Muslim woman or worked for a \"terrorist network\" like Al Jazeera.\n\nShe also called him homophobic slurs and made \"countless other racist and offensive comments\" about interview subjects and coworkers, Bernstein claimed in the lawsuit, which was filed earlier this month.\n\nA publicist for Guerrero, who left \"Inside Edition\" over the summer, shared a statement from CBS Media Ventures that referred to Bernstein's claims as unsubstantiated.\n\nBernstein also claimed that Charles Lachman, the show's executive producer, was known as a \"total homophobe\" and showed bias against Black people and Muslims. According to Bernstein's lawsuit, after Bernstein showed footage of an interview with a female graduate student wearing a hijab, Lachman said, \"Absolutely not! It looks like she's about to set off a bomb.\"\n\n\"On another occasion, plaintiff witnessed Mr. Lachman screaming at a female producer stating 'No! No! No! I don't want to see fat and ugly Kelly Clarkson! I want to see Kelly Clarkson in a short skirt!'\" lawyers for Bernstein wrote in the complaint.\n\nA representative for CBS Media Ventures, the Paramount Global unit that syndicates \"Inside Edition\" and other shows like \"Jeopardy!,\" denied Bernstein's claims.\n\n\"We are committed to a safe and respectful workplace for all,\" the representative wrote in an email. \"After receiving the initial claim letter, outside counsel immediately conducted an investigation, which found no evidence to support these allegations. We will address the matter in court and are committed to vigorously defending against any fabricated claims.\"\n\n\"Inside Edition\" is a tabloid-style syndicated news program that has been running since 1989, focusing on true crime and celebrity coverage, and is a top ratings-getter for CBS Media Ventures, with more than 3 million weekly viewers, according to Nielsen.\n\nCBS Media Ventures is distinct from CBS News, where Bari Weiss was recently named editor-in-chief.\n\nLachman has been its executive producer since the late 1990s, and longtime anchor Deborah Norville left the program last year, replaced by Eva Pilgrim. Bernstein's complaint said he worked there starting in 2019, that he had a medical episode in 2023, and that he was fired about a year later while on leave.\n\nBernstein's lawsuit also claims \"Inside Edition\" engaged in \"deliberate news distortion,\" including by rigging devices to burn and explode so that segments about fireworks, e-bike batteries, and gas grills made those devices appear more dangerous than they were. He claimed that after he learned an e-bike battery had been rigged to explode, senior investigative producer Charlie McLravy told him to \"keep [his] mouth shut and don't say anything to the lawyers.\"\n\nLachman and McLravy didn't reply to comment requests.",

    "description": "A Milwaukee thrifter sensed potential in two 99-cent bowls that turned out to be rare Natzler pieces and later sold for nearly $1,400.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Wendy Sheridan, a full-time intuitive psychic and artist who loves to thrift. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI began thrifting and antiquing at the age of 12. I've always had an interest in reusing and recycling things.\n\nThrifting was my outlet once I stopped working and stayed home with my kids. I used to put my youngest in the stroller with a sucker and take them to Goodwill. I would use my intuition about things; I had a sense when things were going to be significant.\n\nBack then, in the mid-90s, you couldn't research things on your phone. It's harder to find things now because more people are thrifting, and places like Goodwill pre-pick and sell online.\n\nI was so good at it that I started my own antique business, then went into staging people's homes with my finds. I eventually started an interior design business. We've lived in nine different homes, so my creativity with interior spaces has come in handy.\n\nI got divorced after 30 years and moved to Milwaukee, where I didn't know anyone but my daughter. It was a big transition from being in Chicago for 35 years. To get acquainted, I began exploring my surroundings, including thrift stores.\n\nThere's one within walking distance of my house. I'm always on the hunt for things that tell a story, and I collect portraits, busts, and folk art in particular.\n\nIn the summer of 2025, I found two bowls that I think no one else would have suspected had any value or importance — they were marked at $.99 each. But I had a feeling when I picked up the first bowl; I could tell it was finely made.\n\nMy sister is a ceramic artist, so I have some familiarity with the craft. I turned it over and saw there was a handwritten signature on the bottom and a serial number. The bowls were crafted by a husband-and-wife team, Otto and Gertrude Natzler. The name kind of rang a bell, but I didn't know their full story.\n\nThe bowls are from the mid-century period, dating from 1960 to 1964. Gertrude would throw the bowls, and Otto would glaze them. The couple was Austrian and immigrated to California while escaping Europe during World War II. They were really responsible for the resurgence of the craft pottery market. It was once a significant movement, but then World War I and World War II occurred, and production shifted to a more utilitarian focus. Their work brought back people's appreciation for pottery as an art form.\n\nI took them to an auction house that had done previous Natzler sales. They sold for $1,397 at Rago Auctions in August 2025. I posted about it on social media; I didn't expect the Thread to get so many views.\n\nI feel like we're always looking for those moments when we can turn treasure into a profit, although sometimes I hold onto things for a bit.\n\nI've kept an engraved book from 1595 that I found at the same Goodwill, as well as an etching from Mozart's time, around 1785. I have a map from 1600 that I purchased for $5.\n\nIt's fun to connect with others who share the same pleasure in discovering things, and to have it pay off…it was nice to have my intuitive sense come through in such a big way.",

    "description": "Professional stylists and jewelers break down the bracelet, necklace, and jewelry trends that will be in and out this year, from beads to brooches.",
    "fullText": "For the past few years, so many people seemed to wear the same dainty gold chains and understated studs — but in 2026, that's being turned on its head.\n\nThis year's jewelry trends are all about bold statements, bright colors, and individuality.\n\nStylists and jewelers say clients are thinking about their accessories as forms of self-expression. They're crafting outfits around jewelry, and not the other way around.\n\n\"For a while, everything was very quiet luxury, very minimal, and we are starting to see a little bit more personality and fashion,\" professional stylist Liz Teich, creator of The New York Stylist, said. \"I think 2026 is going to be an exciting year for jewelry.\"\n\nSo, it's time to dust off your grandma's heirlooms and those pendant necklaces from 2012 … and get ready for a year of big, fun, artsy pieces.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with three industry experts, including two stylists and a custom jeweler, to get the inside scoop on the trendiest looks for the coming year.\n\nHere's what they said to look out for.\n\nBig, blingy, colorful gems are here to stay and will be a fixture in the jewelry forecast next year.\n\nEmeralds, jade, white sapphires, and other colorful stones are taking center stage. People want \"that big, oversize pop of color,\" Ali Galgano, a New York and Greenwich-based jeweler and founder of Serpentine Jewels, told BI.\n\nThe recent popularity of lab-grown jewels helps make these pieces more affordable and accessible, according to Erin Noël, an LA-based personal and celebrity stylist.\n\nSome people might even take inspiration from runway looks and invest in costume jewelry or lab-grown pieces that look similar.\n\nNecklaces and bracelets with colorful beads seem to be as popular as ever. This kind of jewelry offers a quick way to add color and texture to an outfit, Noël said.\n\nThis trend is reminiscent of the early 2010s, when collar necklaces with chunky beads were huge, Noël added. \"I feel like we're seeing the reiteration of that,\" she said.\n\nIn 2025, Teich noticed a lot of people adding brooches and pins to their outfits — either for a little extra flair or to make their clothing look more sculptural in its draping.\n\nThis trend doesn't seem to be slowing down, either.\n\n\"I'm trying to get my clients to break out a lot of their grandmother's brooches [and] vintage pieces, because now is a good time to pile it all on and show some personality and personalization in your jewelry,\" Teich said.\n\nThe era of quick and cheap jewelry is coming to an end. Stylists believe that shoppers will be much more interested in the sustainability and longevity of the pieces they buy in 2026.\n\nExperts we spoke to said they're noticing an increased interest in vintage jewelry, which often costs less, is more sustainable, and comes with a story.\n\nGalgano said her clients appreciate the rarity of vintage, and \"the sense that no one else will have the exact same piece.\"\n\nAlthough people are starting to express more individuality with their everyday looks, that won't translate to literal personalization in 2026.\n\n\"The big, bubbly nameplates and the enamel friendship-style bracelets are cooling off for our client base,\" Galgano told BI.\n\nShe believes \"loud\" personalization is becoming a thing of the past, but more subtle touches will be huge this year.\n\nThis could look like using a birthstone cluster as a quiet nod to your kids' birth months, or opting for an engraved piece to honor a special moment in your life.\n\nThis year, minimalism will make way for maximalism, according to Noel.\n\nThe loud, statement pieces of the early 2010s are making a comeback. Think: mix-and-match earrings with interesting, sculptural shapes, necklaces with unique pendants, chunky cuffs or beaded bracelets, and statement rings.\n\nStylists, including Teich, predict that short and dainty necklaces will be phased out in favor of chunkier, longer necklaces and layered looks featuring tassels, beads, or pendants.\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean you should get rid of your simple chains and delicate bangles. Instead, try stacking bracelets together or layering different necklaces.",

    "title": "I travel for a living. Here are 9 items I always pack in case my flight is canceled, and I get stranded.",
    "description": "Recent travel chaos in the Caribbean confirmed writer Meagan Drillinger's must-have packing list, including a laptop, earplugs, swimsuit, and more.",
    "fullText": "I travel for a living, which means my work and my income depend on the assumption that I can get from one place to another without everything falling apart.\n\nThis weekend's travel chaos in the Caribbean hit close to home. As flights were canceled and people were stranded for days, I was reflecting on more than just missed vacations. I thought about travelers who couldn't get back to work, couldn't get back to their routines, or didn't have the necessary tools to function once the plan unraveled.\n\nI've been close to that edge before. In early 2020, I was in Colombia just days before airports worldwide began shutting down due to the COVID pandemic. There was a very real moment when I wasn't sure I'd be able to leave the country. I wouldn't pretend that having the \"right\" things with me made me relaxed. In fact, relaxed wasn't a word in my vocabulary at all as I meandered the aisles of Colombian grocery stores, stocking up on ramen and toilet paper for whatever lockdown I was facing back in the US.\n\nGetting stranded is terrible when all you want is to go home. But the travel essentials I had with me made one thing clear: life could still go on, even when the world got rocked. That's shaped how I travel ever since.\n\nFor me, the ability to work from anywhere isn't a productivity flex or a digital nomad brag; it's a necessity. It's a safety net. Here's what I always have with me, and why I would never travel without these things, even on trips that are supposed to be about unplugging.\n\nI'd never, ever go anywhere without my laptop, even on a getaway that's meant to be a break from work.\n\nWhen plans unravel, your laptop becomes leverage. It buys you time, flexibility, and options. I've watched travelers stranded without laptops scrambling to borrow devices, sending frantic messages from phones, or explaining to employers why they suddenly couldn't do their jobs. I refuse to add \"unemployed\" to an already stressful situation.\n\nIt also doubles as your entertainment system when you've got an indeterminate amount of hours to kill. On that note, add a VPN to your list so you can access all your streaming services from any ISP address.\n\nWhen flights get canceled, outlets become scarce, and airports turn into makeshift bedrooms. A portable battery bank — one powerful enough to charge a laptop, not just a phone — means I'm not fighting strangers for wall space just to stay online.\n\nI've filed stories from airport floors using a power bank while entire terminals went dark. It's not glamorous, but it works.\n\nI always carry my passport, even when I'm flying domestically. Plans change. Routes get rerouted. Borders get strange quickly. It's one of those items you hope you never need, but absolutely don't want to be without when things stop making sense.\n\nI travel with more medication than I think I'll need: pain relievers, anti-diarrheal meds, Pepto, and electrolytes, all on top of prescriptions. Delays stretch, and pharmacies close. When your body starts failing on top of travel disruptions, everything feels 10 times worse.\n\nWhen travel collapses, food becomes unpredictable fast.\n\nRestaurants close. Airports sell out. Hunger makes decision-making worse. Protein bars won't solve the problem, but they'll keep you steady enough to solve everything else, especially when your only restaurant option is the TGIFridays in the parking lot of whatever airport hotel you're crashing in.\n\nRest becomes currency when you're stuck. Earplugs and an eye mask make it possible to sleep in loud terminals or unfamiliar rooms. When it comes to socks and underwear, always pack more than you think you need. If the trip stretches and laundry access disappears, comfort suddenly matters more than aesthetics.\n\nThis sounds frivolous until it isn't. If you're stuck somewhere longer than planned, access to water can be a grounding experience. Pools, hot springs, beaches, and hotel spas can sometimes be the only places where your nervous system gets a break.\n\nDeadlines don't care about travel delays. I've filed stories from airport floors, hotel lobbies, and — more times than I can count — from the passenger seat of a moving car. On a cross-country road trip, I was constantly taking interviews, answering editors, and filing stories while the prairies of North Dakota and the Canadian Rockies rolled past my window.\n\nA portable WiFi device or a reliable international data plan means I'm not dependent on hotel routers, café passwords, or the hope that WiFi will magically work when I need it most. When travel breaks down, connectivity is the difference between falling behind and staying afloat.\n\nI never travel without insurance. After a travel companion was in a serious motorbike accident in Thailand and spent a week in a Thai hospital — fully covered because we had travel insurance — I stopped thinking of it as optional.\n\nYou don't have to travel for a living to learn these lessons. Whether you're a business traveler, a freelancer, or someone who just wants to make it home on time, disruptions can happen to anyone.\n\nPacking with the assumption that things might go wrong isn't pessimistic — it's practical. When travel breaks down, the ability to keep working, stay healthy, and remain connected becomes more than convenience. It becomes stability.\n\nDo you have any work-related travel tips you'd like to share? Email this editor, Agnes Applegate, at aapplegate@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "From Barb in season one to Kali in season five, there were plenty of tragic deaths in \"Stranger Things.\" We ranked them all by sadness.",
    "fullText": "Robert Akers (Alex Breaux ) was introduced in season five as a high-ranking soldier reporting to Dr. Kay (Linda Hamilton) and stationed in the Upside Down. His orders were to find and capture Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), whom he viewed as a \"freak.\" He was violent, unrelenting, misogynistic, and had basically zero redeeming qualities.\n\nTime of death: Season five, episode eight, \"The Rightside Up.\"\n\nCause of death: Forced to shoot himself by Eleven's psychic powers.\n\nSadness ranking: -1. Everybody cheered.\n\nGrigori (Andrey Ivchenko) was a Terminator-like hitman tasked with protecting the secret Russian operation beneath the Starcourt Mall. He met his bloody end when Hopper (David Harbour) threw him into the gears of the gate-opening machine, which Soviet soldiers were using to access the Upside Down.\n\nTime of death: Season three, episode eight, \"The Battle of Starcourt.\"\n\nCause of death: Killed by Hopper in combat.\n\nSadness ranking: 0. It's hard to feel much sympathy for Grigori given his own penchant for murder; he killed the sweet scientist Alexei, for crying out loud, but more on that later. Hopper sends him off with a well-earned, \"See you in hell.\"\n\nVecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) was once an ordinary kid named Henry Creel. Decades before the events of \"Stranger Things,\" Henry was possessed by the Mind Flayer and imbued with the entity's evil magic.\n\nEventually, Henry became the first child test subject at Hawkins Lab, where his blood was used to create more superpowered children, including Eleven.\n\nAfter Henry went on a killing spree in the lab, Eleven opened a portal and banished him to another dimension, where he was reunited with the Mind Flayer and transformed into the vine-covered creature known as Vecna.\n\nTime of death: Season five, episode eight, \"The Rightside Up.\"\n\nCause of death: Impaled by Eleven, then decapitated by Joyce (Winona Ryder).\n\nSadness ranking: 0.5. Even with Bower's masterfully nuanced performance as Henry slash One slash Mr. Whatsit slash Vecna, it's impossible to deny that in his final incarnation, that creepy wizard had to die.\n\nDespite a last-ditch attempt by Will (Noah Schnapp) to appeal to his human past, Vecna admitted that he'd become too deeply entwined with the Mind Flayer to ever be free of its influence — the influence that led him to brutally murder his own mother and sister, nearly all of the kids who were held captive in Hawkins Lab, and dozens of other innocent people in Hawkins, not to mention everyone he psychologically tortured. He wreaked a phenomenal amount of havoc, and for the world to be safe, Vecna's defeat was inevitable.\n\nThe only scrap of pity for Vecna was earned in his final moments, as he choked on his own bile and blood. \"The feeling that I want to convey and the words that I'm trying to get out are just, 'Please don't,'\" Bower said.\n\nDr. Brenner, aka Papa (Matthew Modine), kidnapped Eleven as a newborn. He confined Eleven and her fellow child test subjects within Hawkins Lab, performing experiments on them.\n\nSeason four initially seemed like it would give Brenner a redemption arc. When Dr. Owens (Paul Reiser) brought Eleven to the Nina Project headquarters in Nevada, where she realized that Brenner was still alive, he briefly seemed to regain her trust.\n\nHowever, Brenner re-revealed his true nature when Eleven attempted to leave the facility to help her friends in Hawkins. Instead of letting her go in peace, Brenner opted to drug her and hold her captive.\n\nLingering in Nevada proved to be the scientist's downfall when Lt. Sullivan (Sherman Augustus) attacked the compound. Brenner was shot and killed while attempting to escape with Eleven on foot.\n\nAlthough he begged Eleven for forgiveness, her final words to him spoke volumes: \"Goodbye, Papa.\"\n\nTime of death: Season four, episode eight, \"Papa.\"\n\nCause of death: Gunned down by the US military.\n\nSadness ranking: 1. Brenner returned in season four as a more complex, morally ambiguous character than he was presented previously. However, he once again tried to imprison Eleven and died almost immediately as a result. That feels an awful lot like karma.\n\nThroughout season four of \"Stranger Things,\" Hawkins High basketball star Jason Carver (Mason Dye) was on a violent crusade to avenge his girlfriend Chrissy, whose brutal murder was the first death of the season. (Again, more on that later.)\n\nUnfortunately, Jason was way off base about the town's true threat, becoming a tragic representation of the Satanic Panic that gripped the US in the '80s.\n\nTime of death: Season four, episode nine, \"The Piggyback.\"\n\nCause of death: Torn apart by an expanding gate to the Upside Down.\n\nSadness ranking: 2. Jason was a narrow-minded pain in the ass throughout season four, so it's hard to imagine that anyone was sorry to see him go. But to be fair, he was driven mad by grief, so he earned a couple of points out of pity.\n\nAgent Harmon (Ira Amyx) was one of two secret agents reporting to Owens who were assigned to protect Will, Mike (Finn Wolfhard), and Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) in season four.\n\nHarmon took a bullet when the US military surprise-attacked the Byers' house. As he was bleeding out in Argyle's pizza van, he used his final breaths to help the boys find Eleven.\n\nTime of death: Season four, episode five, \"The Nina Project.\"\n\nCause of death: Shot during a military raid on the Byers' house.\n\nSadness ranking: 2.5. Although Harmon wasn't a huge presence in the show, he seemed to genuinely care about trying to protect Eleven and the rest of the children. That and the relative shock of the raid made for a somewhat tragic demise.\n\nA number of Hawkins residents fell victim to the Mind Flayer over the course of season three. Chief among them was Heather Holloway (Francesca Reale), a friendly lifeguard whom Billy attacked, kidnapped, and brought as a sacrifice to the fleshy monster.\n\nTime of death: Season three, episode six, \"E Pluribus Unum.\"\n\nCause of death: Dissolved into goo to form the body of the Mind Flayer, along with her parents, Mrs. Driscoll, and other unnamed residents of Hawkins.\n\nSadness ranking: 3. Heather was doomed from the moment her path crossed with Billy in his possessed state, but that didn't make her fate any less horrific.\n\nPatrick McKinney (Myles Truitt), one of the members of the Hawkins High basketball team, began to show symptoms of Vecna's curse while investigating Chrissy's death with his teammates. He succumbed to the bone-snapping, eye-gouging evil in Lover's Lake.\n\nTime of death: Season four, episode five, \"The Nina Project.\"\n\nSadness ranking: 3.5. Although we didn't learn much about Patrick prior to his death, he seemed like a mostly good kid, and he certainly didn't deserve to die by Vecna's sadistic hand. Additionally, Patrick's kindness toward Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) made his death sting that much more.\n\nFred Benson (Logan Riley Bruner), the managing editor at the Hawkins High newspaper, became Vecna's second teenage victim in season four. He began experiencing Vecna-induced hallucinations while traveling with Nancy (Natalia Dyer) to investigate Chrissy's death.\n\nTime of death: Season four, episode two, \"Vecna's Curse.\"\n\nSadness ranking: 4. Vecna chose Fred to victimize because he was haunted by guilt. While afflicted by the curse, Fred was forced to hallucinate a car crash from his past, which he survived, but another kid did not.\n\nIt's upsetting to watch Fred relive the traumatic incident, and it's even more upsetting to watch Nancy realize that yet another of her friends has been killed by supernatural evil, while yet again, she was safe and clueless nearby.\n\nStar cheerleader Chrissy Cunningham (Grace Van Dien) was described by Eddie as the \"queen of Hawkins High.\" She was pretty and popular, yet privately struggled with maternal abuse and body image issues — struggles that Vecna was all too happy to exploit with his signature psychological torture.\n\nChrissy fell to Vecna's curse during an ill-timed visit to Eddie's trailer. At that time, hers was arguably the most gruesome death in the show's history, setting the tone for season four's Freddy Krueger-inspired killing spree.\n\nTime of death: Season four, episode one, \"The Hellfire Club.\"\n\nSadness ranking: 5. In the meager screentime she was given, Chrissy came across as kind, naive, and entirely undeserving of her fate.\n\nAlthough she only appeared alive in a single episode, Chrissy was established as a multidimensional character, someone you couldn't help but root for. Her charming banter with Eddie gave us a glimpse into what could have been. That potential made her death all the more gut-wrenching.\n\nFrom the moment of his arrival in season two, Billy Hargrove was a bully. He was particularly cruel to his younger step-sister, Max (Sadie Sink), and her boyfriend, Lucas.\n\nThat's not to say that Billy himself didn't suffer; he was physically abused by his father and never healed from the death of his mother.\n\nBilly's trauma and pent-up aggression made him the perfect host for the Mind Flayer in season three. Although he spent most of those episodes acting at the beast's behest, Dacre Montgomery's vivid portrayal offered glimpses into Billy's true self, which seemed to be stained with fear, pain, and guilt.\n\nTime of death: Season three, episode eight, \"The Battle of Starcourt.\"\n\nCause of death: Stabbed through the heart by the Mind Flayer.\n\nSadness ranking: 6. As the Mind Flayer ravaged the Starcourt Mall, Eleven helped Billy break free of its control by reminding him of his beloved mother. Struck with sudden clarity, Billy sacrificed himself to the monster's wrath.\n\nDid Billy atone for all his sins with this last-minute act of heroism? Not exactly. But he's one of the few characters who's managed to save Eleven, rather than the other way around — and it was heartbreaking to witness the horror on Max's face as her brother was violently impaled. Her lasting trauma is what made Billy's death tragic.\n\nAlexei (Alec Utgoff) was a Russian scientist tasked with opening a new gate to the Upside Down in Hawkins. He was taken into custody by Joyce, Hopper, and Murray (Brett Gelman) after they discovered the secret plot.\n\nRemoved from the demands of his superiors, it was hard not to develop affection for Alexei as he gossiped with Murray, played carnival games, and guzzled cherry Slurpees.\n\nTime of death: Season three, episode seven, \"The Bite.\"\n\nCause of death: Shot by Grigori.\n\nSadness ranking: 6.5. Alexei was never going to make it out of season three alive. He was labeled a traitor by the Soviets and hunted down by Grigori, who shot him in the middle of a Fourth of July carnival. Alexei was still gripping the giant stuffed animal he'd just won.\n\nEven though it seemed inevitable, Alexei's murder was surprisingly poignant, especially as Murray tried and failed to save him.\n\nBenny Hammond (Chris Sullivan) was the first person Eleven met after escaping from Hawkins Lab, the government facility where she was tortured and traumatized for her entire life. He gave her food and showed her kindness. Understandably, he also called social services, believing Eleven to be an ordinary runaway who needed help.\n\nThat phone call was intercepted by the federal Department of Energy, which, at that point in the story, owned and operated Hawkins Lab. Secret agents arrived at Benny's restaurant that very night and murdered him in cold blood. The shooting was staged to look like a death by suicide, leaving Benny's loved ones in mourning and confusion.\n\nTime of death: Season one, episode one, \"The Vanishing of Will Byers.\"\n\nCause of death: Shot by DOE agent Connie Frazier.\n\nSadness ranking: 7.5. Benny was murdered in the very first episode of \"Stranger Things,\" and it came as quite a soul-crushing shock. It immediately established the stakes of the show — and the extreme level of violence Brenner's team was willing to commit in the name of recapturing Eleven.\n\nBob Newby (Sean Astin) was a goofy yet endearing addition in season two.\n\nIntroduced as Joyce's devoted new boyfriend, there wasn't much to dislike about the enthusiastic Radio Shack employee. Throughout the season, Bob proved himself dedicated to becoming a member of the Byers family, and he did his best to support Will and Jonathan through their recent traumas.\n\nUnfortunately, Bob was dragged into the line of fire after Hopper went missing in the tunnels beneath Hawkins. Bob helped Joyce track him down and later joined the gang on a dangerous mission into Hawkins Lab.\n\nWhen the power went out in the Demodog-infested lab, Bob volunteered to reset the breakers, being the only one in the group with knowledge of the computer programming language. Although his solo mission was a success, the writing was on the wall when he accidentally left his gun behind at the computer terminal.\n\nTime of death: Season two, episode eight, \"The Mind Flayer.\"\n\nCause of death: Mauled by a pack of Demodogs.\n\nSadness ranking: 8. Sweet, innocent Bob. He never stood a chance. The pain of his gory death was aggravated by the fact that Joyce was there to witness it — and the fact that he was so close to survival, making it all the way to the lab's lobby before the monsters caught up with him.\n\nWill wasn't the only kid to go missing in season one of \"Stranger Things.\" There was also Barbara Holland, aka Barb (Shannon Purser), Nancy's best friend.\n\nShortly after Will's disappearance, Barb accompanied Nancy to hang out with Steve (Joe Keery) at his house — begrudgingly, yes, but out of love and support for her best friend. It wasn't long before Nancy asked Barb to leave so she and Steve could be alone.\n\nBarb, left stranded and bleeding by Steve's pool, became an easy target for the Demogorgon.\n\nThe creature dragged Barb into the Upside Down and killed her, leaving her rotting corpse for Eleven to find later. Barb's death became a catalyst for Nancy, Jonathan, and Steve to join the fight against the supernatural evils in Hawkins — but otherwise, it didn't receive much screentime.\n\nBarb's death struck a nerve when the first season aired. Fans demanded justice, enraged by the fact that no one in Hawkins except for Nancy seemed to care about Barb as much as Will. The show's creators, Matt and Ross Duffer, were taken aback by the passion.\n\n\"The one note that we consistently got back was, 'What about Barb?' And we're like, 'It's a show about Will,'\" Ross recently told Time.\n\n\"Netflix kept harassing us about it,\" Matt added. \"And it turns out they were right.\"\n\nTime of death: Season one, episode three, \"Holly, Jolly.\"\n\nCause of death: Killed by the Demogorgon.\n\nSadness ranking: 9. Barb's grisly death was made even more distressing by Nancy's grief.\n\nTormented by survivor's guilt, Nancy made #JusticeForBarb her mission in season two. She enlisted Jonathan and Murray, a journalist-turned-private investigator with a penchant for the supernatural, to publicly blame Hawkins Lab for Barb's death. Even if it wasn't the whole truth, it at least gave Barb's grieving parents some closure.\n\nStill, the lack of attention paid to Barb's disappearance in season one — and the fact that she basically died because she was forced to be a third wheel — made her death one of the show's most memorable to date. Without Barb, \"Stranger Things\" would have had a lot less heart.\n\nEddie Munson (Joseph Quinn) was introduced in season four as the president of the high school's Hellfire Club, a group dedicated to Dungeons & Dragons, and a proud social outcast on the brink of graduation.\n\nEddie's refusal to conform, his not-so-secret dorkiness, plus his obvious affection for Mike, Erica (Priah Ferguson), and especially Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), made him immediately lovable. He was unwittingly thrust into the supernatural action when Chrissy was killed by Vecna's curse in his trailer.\n\nEddie's association with Hellfire Club made him an easy target for the police and angry mobs in Hawkins, and he spent most of the season in hiding — until he decided to join the original gang on their mission to invade the Upside Down. \"I say you're asking me to follow you into Mordor, which, if I'm totally straight with you, I think is a really bad idea,\" he told Dustin, referencing \"The Lord of the Rings.\" \"But the Shire… the Shire is burning. So Mordor it is.\"\n\nEddie was assigned the task of distracting the Demobats so that Nancy, Steve, and Robin (Maya Hawke) could attack Vecna unimpeded. He succeeded by shredding through Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\" on his electric guitar, drawing the creatures toward him. Then, in a break from the original plan, he made sure Dustin was safe before sacrificing himself to keep the bats occupied.\n\nTime of death: Season four, episode nine, \"The Piggyback.\"\n\nCause of death: Stabbed by a colony of Demobats in the Upside Down.\n\nSadness ranking: 10. Almost from the moment Eddie arrived onscreen, it was pretty clear that he was doomed. \"Stranger Things\" always had a penchant for killing off newcomers, and Eddie made matters worse by declaring in his very first scene, \"This is my year, I can feel it. '86, baby!\" Talk about tempting fate.\n\nWith each of Eddie's increasingly endearing scenes — charming Chrissy, teasing Steve, forming a brotherly bond with Dustin — the idea of his impending death hurt a little bit more. By the time it actually happened and Eddie delivered that fateful full-circle line as he bled out in Dustin's arms (\"I think it's my year, Henderson. I think it's finally my year\"), it hit as close to agony as a fictional TV show death can get.",

    "description": "I spent most of my childhood sick at home because of my severe allergies. When I turned to immunization shots, I knew it would be a time commitment.",
    "fullText": "Environmental allergies affected me year-round throughout my childhood. Animals, plants, dust, pollen — all of these things would make me sick to the point of barely breathing. While other kids were playing outside, I would opt to stay in my room because the impact of my allergies felt like getting the flu on a daily basis.\n\nI tried different medications — over-the-counter and prescription — with minimal success. But compared to the alternative, it felt like I couldn't survive without them. Living with my difficult allergies was challenging.\n\nBut finding the right allergist changed my life.\n\nAs a kid, my parents couldn't commit to the significant time suck immunization would take. But when I started college, I decided to take on the challenge myself.\n\nThe allergist I saw did a test on me that felt like getting bitten by a swarm of mosquitoes. She administered about 40 tiny shots of different allergens and measured my skin's reaction to determine how allergic I was to each thing.\n\nIt was no surprise to me when I saw my skin react negatively to just about everything. It was an uncomfortable process, but the thought of a life where I could spend Spring days outdoors in the grass was too much to forgo.\n\nAfter the tests were done, the doctor told me I would need about five years of immunization shots, starting with bi-weekly injections for several months. It was a massive commitment, but I was ready.\n\nSince I was in college and my allergist was thankfully just one town over, I was able to visit before classes and had four shots administered per visit. I was required to wait 30 minutes to be sure I didn't have a reaction. It was always a good thing I did because I sometimes experienced significant reactions. The nurses who administered the shots knew just what to do and helped me through. The discomfort was minimal compared to the ample benefits the shots brought me.\n\nAs fantastic as the benefits of spending time outside were, it was the animals that really made me realize how much of an improvement I was feeling. I had accepted it as a part of my life that I would never have a pet or be able to spend much time around them, until I started the process of getting the immunization shots.\n\nI didn't even notice that the severe reactions were gone until I left the home of some friends with two cats and didn't puff up.\n\nIt was as if I was never allergic to begin with, and from there a new world opened up to me.\n\nAfter five years of receiving the shots, I moved into my first apartment away from home. I had never considered the possibility of getting a pet, but having that newfound space of my own and a strong handle on my allergies, I decided it was time.\n\nI always considered myself a dog person because I was so much more allergic to cats, but for the stage of life I was in, I felt I was better equipped to give a cat a good home. After visiting various rescues and searching online, I came across a young cat in need of a home who had been returned by a previous family. She had a lot of anxiety, but I did too, so I decided to give fostering a try.\n\nI proudly became a \"foster failure,\" as it only took a few days to realize I could never let my new best friend, Munchkin, leave my side. Even now, I think back on what a new feeling it was to have an animal companion that didn't make me sick to be around, but I couldn't picture life otherwise anymore.\n\nEvery ounce of time and effort it took to get those shots was worth it. The immunization shots changed my life for the better, and the life of one now very spoiled little cat.",

    "description": "Some of the oldest restaurants in America have been in operation since the late 1600s.",
    "fullText": "If you want to dine like it's 1899, look no further than these historic restaurants.\n\nFrom 17th-century taverns to classic dining cars, historic restaurants with enduring legacies are scattered across the United States, each with its own rich history.\n\nBusiness Insider identified the oldest continuously operating restaurants in the country — some dating back to before the US was founded — where diners can still enjoy historic charm and classic comfort foods, such as turkey dinners and burgers.\n\nWhile some historic restaurants are more upscale, others are far more casual, roadside stops.\n\nHere is the oldest restaurant in every state.\n\nThis old-fashioned restaurant dates back to 1869.

    "description": "Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgwater Associates, says the blistering rally in gold last year is a reflection of precarious macro developments.",
    "fullText": "Ray Dalio spent 2025 expressing fear and urging caution, and he's remaining cautious as the US economy enters a new year.\n\nThe founder of Bridgewater Associates sounded alarms throughout 2025 over what he sees as a budding global debt crisis and the waning value of fiat currency.\n\nThe surge in gold last year—the biggest gain for the metal since 1979—contains a warning for investors, specifically as it relates to the depreciating value of fiat money, Dalio said in a post on Monday.\n\nA potent cocktail of central bank buying, geopolitical worries, and appetite from individuals pushed gold to records all year, but Dalio argues that the gold rally is mainly a result of fiat money losing real value. In his view, that was the biggest story in markets in 2025.\n\n\"The best major investment of the year was long gold (returning 65% in dollar terms), which outperformed the S&P index (which returned 18% in dollars) by 47%,\" he said. \"Or, said differently, the S&P fell by 28% in gold-money terms.\"\n\nDalio urged investors to consider a few key factors when evaluating the forces that drove markets in 2025. Specifically, he highlighted that examining investment through calculations made in a depreciating currency can be misleading, as it can make returns appear stronger than they actually were.\n\nFrom Dalio's perspective, the stock market's 2025 performance varied greatly based on the measuring stick.\n\n\"When one's own currency goes down, it makes it look like the things measured in it went up,\" he said. \"In this case, the S&P returned 18% for a dollar-based investor, 17% for a yen-based investor, 13% for a renminbi-based investor, only 4% for a euro-based investor, only 3% for a Swiss franc-based investor, and, for a gold-based investor, it returned -28%.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has touted the economic benefits of a weakening US dollar, attempting to frame it as beneficial for US exports. But economic think tanks such as the Cato Institute have argued against this perspective, claiming that it ignores negative spillover effects for US consumers.\n\nDalio seems to share that mindset, noting that a weaker currency tends to lower the cost of a nation's exported goods for international buyers while increasing the price of domestic imports.\n\n\"When one's currency goes down, it reduces one's wealth and one's buying power, it makes one's goods and services cheaper in others' currencies, and it makes others' goods and services more expensive in one's own currency.\"\n\nIn his view, rising gold prices reflect a weakening economy and a national currency that is decreasing in value. For that reason, Dalio sees the continued strength of the so-called debasement trade as a warning for the US.\n\nThe stock market's big bull run in recent years might also be making it easier for investors to disregard other warning signals flashing in the economy. Dalio emphasized that the gold rally is a reason to reassess the macro picture and take a more cautious position.\n\nThe billionaire investor added that stocks and gold benefited from monetary policy easing in 2025, but as both assets are no longer cheap, they're at risk of a pullback if conditions shift again.\n\n\"Whether or not you are currency hedged matters a lot,\" Dalio said. \"You should always be hedged to your least-risk currency mix and make tactical moves from there if you think you are capable of making them well.\"",

    "description": "American's 149,000-square-foot operations center is responsible for moving nearly 6,000 flights and supporting half a million customers every day.",
    "fullText": "Just days into the new year, airlines were forced to manage widespread operational disruptions after US strikes on Venezuela triggered airspace restrictions across parts of the Caribbean.\n\nAircraft, crews, and passengers were scattered across the region with limited options for getting home. Almost immediately, airlines began coordinating recovery efforts — scheduling ad-hoc flights and sourcing aircraft ranging from regional jets to widebody planes.\n\nThat kind of behind-the-scenes decision-making happens inside massive operations centers that few travelers ever see.\n\nAmerican Airlines — among the carriers most affected in the Caribbean — invited Business Insider to tour its Integrated Operations Center, or IOC, at its Dallas/Fort Worth headquarters in 2024. For privacy reasons, the company requested that photos of certain screens and employees' faces be blurred.\n\nThe tornado-resistant IOC runs 24 hours a day, every day of the year. It houses over 20 teams responsible for dispatching planes, monitoring weather, organizing maintenance and cargo, and preventing misconnects, among myriad other duties.\n\nThat machinery reacted in real-time on Saturday as the Venezuela-related disruptions unfolded. One American plane from Guyana to Miami added an extra hour of flight time to avoid the southern Caribbean. Others never left the ground, leaving passengers stranded on islands like Puerto Rico, Aruba, and Saint Thomas.\n\nTo accelerate recovery, American deployed roughly 8,000 seats and 50 extra flights to the region on Sunday and Monday. Regional aircraft were sent to Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands to ferry passengers to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where larger jets could take over.\n\nOnce passengers were consolidated in San Juan, American used Boeing 777s — the largest aircraft in its fleet — to fly about 300 people at a time to Miami.\n\n\"Even before the airspace was reopened early Sunday morning, teams from across American were hard at work to recover our Eastern Caribbean operation once we had the green light,\" David Seymour, American's Chief Operating Officer, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Working 24/7 and with a singular and unrelenting focus on helping as many customers as possible, the team has pulled out all the stops,\" he added. \"I'm proud of them every day, but the American team shines in moments like this.\"\n\nMark Groat, American's IOC system customer service duty manager who led the site tour in 2024, described the 149,000-square-foot IOC as the \"nerve center\" of the airline.\n\nIt's strategically set up to enable communication and collaboration between the teams.\n\nFor example, the lights are dimmed to reduce strain when looking at screens all day, and the phones use a color light system above each seat to indicate if that person is on a call.\n\n\"A red light means you're on the phone, and a green light means your phone is ringing,\" Groat said, noting the maintenance team, for example, has a line to airport hangars. \"So, you can kind of gauge just looking over the floor what kind of day we're having.\"\n\nHe added that on busy days when everyone is talking and walking around, white noise is pumped into the IOC to keep the room quiet.\n\nAmerican was among the least punctual airlines in 2025. Data from the aviation analytics company Cirium shows the carrier had a 76.4% on-time arrival rate, only beating JetBlue and Frontier. United was at 78.8% and Delta hit 80.1%.\n\nMaintenance and crew staffing are common airline-caused disruptors, but American — and US carriers as a whole — also faced uncontrollable factors, including weather, air traffic control, and a historic government shutdown.\n\nWhen delays begin to cascade, decision-making becomes less about individual flights and more about the network as a whole. That network-level oversight happens on the \"bridge.\"\n\nThis is where the IOC director, hub managers, and other liaisons develop plans for \"irregular operations\" that will impact the fewest customers possible. They're looking at things like staffing, resources, and gate constraints, Groat said.\n\nWhile much of this analysis is done manually, Groat said American has an automation tool known as the \"Hub Efficiency Analytics Tool,\" or HEAT, to help dispatchers, coordinators, and other employees make more proactive decisions.\n\nIt analyzes factors such as when a crew member exceeds their regulated duty period, which flights have the highest number of connecting customers, how many top-tier loyalty customers are flying, and whether affected flights are domestic or international — domestic flights being easier to accommodate.\n\n\"Instead of separate units canceling flights one by one and customers being rebooked repeatedly, HEAT allows us to update the system with all the delays and cancellations at one time,\" Groat said.\n\n\"This maintains the integrity of connecting bags, and it means we aren't arbitrarily rerouting somebody who could have ultimately made their connection.\"\n\nOn the day of my visit, smoke from a wildfire in the Bahamas was affecting operations at Nassau International Airport. IOC employees walked desk-to-desk, discussing options, while others analyzed how flights would be affected — which is where HEAT could come into play.\n\n\"We'll most likely divert en route planes to Miami to wait out the event,\" Groat said about the response. \"If the delay times get longer and crew time becomes an issue, we'll have to evaluate options like canceling some flights or consolidating two into one so we can get our resources back into the system and where they need to be.\"\n\nUtilizing interisland flights and 777s during the chaos in the Caribbean is a prime example of resource optimization.\n\nAmerican also launched a new tool at certain airports in 2025 that helps determine which flights can be held for connecting customers without disrupting the network. This was previously done manually and on a case-by-case basis.\n\nPlanes can't go anywhere without at least two pilots and at least one flight attendant per 50 seats. Crew scheduling is responsible for keeping some 14,000 crew on track every day.\n\nThere are three different areas within the crew scheduling department, Groat said. One handles day-to-day crewing, a second is responsible for tracking disruptions and calling in reserves, and a third helps make decisions regarding delays and cancellations.\n\nThe job relies on computer systems and knowledge of specific regulations regarding fatigue and duty time, but American also provides automation tools like HEAT to help schedulers quickly and accurately staff flights.\n\nHe added that there are times when things get so displaced that not every flight can be accommodated, so the crew coordinators identify \"critical\" flights that need to be prioritized for operational needs.\n\nFor example, if a key plane doesn't make it to its next airport and no replacement can get there either, a chain of disruption could occur.\n\nBeyond crew scheduling, nearly half of the IOC floor is dedicated to teams that oversee specific fleets, including sections for the Boeing 737 family, the Airbus A320 family, and widebody jets.\n\nThese teams comprise flight dispatchers, planners who collaborate with maintenance, and crew coordinators. There are also customer service managers who are \"the voice of the passenger\" and try to proactively find solutions during disruptions.\n\nGroat also pointed to a relatively new but highly specialized team of irregular operations leads who examine long-term strategies to prevent hourslong delays affecting flights down the line.\n\nFor example, the team may consider rerouting specific planes over water to avoid severe weather in Florida or analyze how de-icing delays in Chicago could impact departures, he said.\n\n\"Every flight that we can route around a disruptor is another slot we keep flying,\" he said.\n\nWhile crew scheduling and dispatchers make up the IOC's bigger work groups, smaller teams like cargo and maintenance coordinators, load planners, air traffic liaisons, regional dispatchers, and unaccompanied minor organizers also have roles to fill.\n\n\"When disruption happens, we need to know what cargo is on the airplane that we need to care for, like perishable items, live animals, or pharmaceuticals,\" Groat said. \"Load planners ensure the aircraft are within the right weight and balance.\"\n\nRegional dispatchers coordinate American's subsidiary and contract flying and help find replacement planes when the regional side is disrupted. Groups like schools and sports teams are especially harder to re-accommodate\n\nThe command center is a giant, glass-enclosed room that is designated for incidents and accidents. Groat said it's only been put to use twice since moving into the IOC building in 2015.\n\nHe said the first use was after the bomb attack at Brussels Airport in 2016, which didn't impact American directly, but the airline still used the command center as a point of contact to help find where its customers and team members were.\n\nGroat said the second event was the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft after two crashes killed 346 people in 2018 and 2019.\n\n\"For the Max, we had 24 planes taken out of the system very quickly, and all of them were in Miami,\" he said. \"We needed the means to find replacement aircraft from other parts of the system to restore the schedule there.\"\n\nEditor's Note: This article was originally published in May 2024 and has been updated following the travel disruptions caused by the US's January 2026 strike on Venezuela.",

    "description": "Transformers operate as horizontal token-by-token scanners; at each generation step, the model attends to an ever-growing sequence of token-level states. This access pattern increases prefill latency and makes long-context decoding increasingly memory-bound, as KV-cache reads and writes dominate inference throughput rather than arithmetic computation. We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for Top-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces flat scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access. PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder progressively compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations. Experimental results show that PHOTON is superior to competitive Transformer-based language models regarding the throughput-quality trade-off, offering significant advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks.",

    "fullText": "Amazon has aggressively fought outside companies' efforts to scrape its data. Now, the e-commerce giant is being criticized for adopting the same tactic itself, pulling product listings from other retailers without their consent.\n\nAmazon has been testing a feature that lists products it doesn't sell, showing items from other retailers and brands without their permission. Shoppers who click on these new listings on Amazon.com are redirected to the external sites where the products are sold. Sellers who don't want their products featured can request to have their items be removed, but Amazon doesn't ask retailers to opt in ahead of time.\n\nThe new feature, called \"Shop Direct,\" is currently in beta and only available for certain product categories.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider the new tool is \"designed to expand discovery for customers and help businesses reach more customers.\" The product details, like prices and names, are pulled from \"public information on a brand's website,\" the spokesperson added.\n\n\"Amazon is a longstanding supporter of small and independent businesses, and today more than 60% of sales in our store are from independent sellers who leverage our innovative tools and services to run their businesses and serve customers,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe test reflects a markedly different position on data scraping for Amazon. The company has previously blocked AI tools from OpenAI and Google from collecting its product listing data, and filed a lawsuit against Perplexity over the AI startup's use of Amazon's shopping platform.\n\nJuozas Kaziukenas, founder of Marketplace Pulse, told Business Insider that it's unclear how Amazon manages product details and pricing for the new Shop Direct feature, which he described as \"full of oddness.\"\n\nIn a separate LinkedIn post, Kaziukenas said it was ironic that Amazon was engaging in the very behavior it prohibits others from doing.\n\n\"All of this is bizarre because Amazon blocked all AI scrapers and sued Perplexity for building automated buying on top of Amazon, while at the same time doing the same thing with others' ecommerce websites,\" he wrote.\n\nThe feature appears to be a part of Amazon's broader push to turn its marketplace into the definitive source of information for \"all products worldwide,\" an initiative internally codenamed Project Starfish, as Business Insider previously reported. An internal document said the AI tool was expected to collect product data from 200,000 external brand websites last year by \"crawling, scraping, and mapping external items to Amazon's catalog.\"\n\nThe move turns Amazon into more of a search engine, akin to Google, which scrapes retail site listings and sends commercial queries out to the web.\n\nAmazon also rolled out a \"Buy for Me\" feature last year that surfaces products from other brands' websites and lets shoppers complete purchases without leaving the Amazon app.\n\nThe new feature has caught some online sellers off guard.\n\nAngie Chua, CEO of stationery accessory maker Bobo Design Studio, said she was puzzled when her products began appearing on Amazon late last month. She later posted a video saying she had never been informed of the program and had not opted in. Amazon pulled her products after she requested their removal.\n\nChua told Business Insider that the listings frequently contained incorrect product names and information. She described Amazon's actions as \"insulting,\" stating that they had damaged her brand and customer relationships. She added that she's aware of more than 100 brands that have had similar experiences.\n\n\"It completely undermines the trust that small businesses are working so hard to create,\" Chua said.\n\nData scraping has become a flashpoint in the AI industry, as companies seek vast amounts of information to train models and provide chat-style direct answers for users. For Amazon, which operates the largest online shopping site in the US, preventing rivals from crawling its marketplace for valuable training data is especially critical.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Why Mark Cuban says AI is both 'stupid' and a make-or-break tool for businesses",
    "description": "Mark Cuban explained why he's bullish about AI, even though chatbots can be \"stupid\" and don't always give accurate, timely information.",
    "fullText": "Mark Cuban believes businesses need to embrace AI to succeed, but he says those that use it incorrectly are doomed to failure.\n\n\"There's going to be two types of companies: those who are great at AI, and everybody else,\" the celebrity billionaire of \"Shark Tank\" fame said. \"And the 'everybody else' is going to fail because AI is such a transformative tool.\"\n\nThe comments came during a call with Clipbook founder Adam Joseph, whose startup secured a seven-figure investment from Cuban. Business Insider reviewed a recording of the call.\n\nOn the call, Cuban explained to Joseph how he believed everyone, from entrepreneurs to employees, should — and shouldn't — use AI.\n\nLike fellow shark Kevin O'Leary, Cuban thinks AI will have a substantial positive impact on businesses that implement it well. However, business leaders need to understand the intricacies and distinctions between different AI tools and not treat them as interchangeable. He said using AI ineffectively could turn helpful tools into an expensive distraction.\n\n\"Because AI is continuously changing, you need to just have people — and, really, every CEO — taking the time to understand every nuance of every new tool that comes out,\" Cuban said.\n\nThe world is still \"in the first inning of the first preseason game\" of the AI revolution, Cuban said, even though generative AI tools like ChatGPT have been out for more than three years, while other forms of AI, like machine learning, have been around for decades.\n\nTech companies like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Elon Musk's xAI are spending tens of billions of dollars to win the AI wars.\n\nCuban said that \"it's too early to tell\" which of those companies will succeed, or if someone else will create the go-to AI chatbot.\n\n\"They all want to be the destination that everybody turns to, but it's not that straightforward, and we don't have a winner yet,\" Cuban said.\n\nBusinesses that discount the power of AI are destined to get disrupted, in Cuban's view.\n\n\"If I'm going to compete in an AI world, data or information is more valuable than gold, more valuable than oil,\" Cuban said.\n\nBut for all the hype about AI, Cuban is clear-eyed about the technology's limitations. AI tools can be mistake-prone yet hyperconfident, and chatbots aren't always smart.\n\n\"AI is stupid,\" Cuban said. \"But it's somebody who's a savant that remembers everything.\"\n\nCuban likened AI chatbots to people who have minds like a steel trap. These tools are able to instantly recall and process tons of information, then aggregate it in one place.\n\n\"It does a really good job of assembling all those things that it collected and presenting that just as somebody who has a great memory,\" Cuban said.\n\nAI chatbots have holes besides so-called hallucinations, Cuban said. AI tools sometimes don't pull up-to-date information. They can also be unclear about how they reach their conclusions, as their algorithms are opaque and can cite faulty or inaccurate links.\n\nHe also said that people often presume the \"AI models they're using or creating\" will provide all the answers they need, but that's \"just not the case.\"\n\nCuban said AI can actively harm businesses that use it incorrectly or those that don't understand its capabilities.\n\nEmployees who use standard versions of tools like ChatGPT could be compromising sensitive company information. Similarly, businesses that post their work online must also realize that they could be giving it away for free to web-scraping chatbots hungry for new information.\n\n\"Companies are learning now that their IP is incredibly valuable,\" Cuban said. \"Two years ago, last year, two months ago, they might have just posted everything on the net to show how smart they are, or shared everything in a proposal to show how smart they are. Now, you have to be really careful with your IP.\"\n\nCuban said academics or hospital researchers must pivot in the AI age away from a \"publish or perish\" mindset, where they share their findings widely in peer-reviewed journals.\n\n\"Now, doing that's the biggest mistake you can make, because all you're doing is training somebody else's models,\" Cuban said. \"And so you've got to be able to understand what IP you need to be able to protect, how you're going to disseminate that IP, whether or not you want to sell it, or keep it for your own models, and how you acquire information.\"",

    "slug": "why-is-nature-considered-a-prestigious-journal",
    "title": "Why is Nature considered a \"prestigious\" journal?",
    "description": "Since launching in 1869, Nature has evolved from a periodical offering commentary on pigeons to the prestige journal in science. But how did Nature build its reputation, and can it last?",
    "fullText": "Science seeks truths that outlive those who discover them. English poet William Wordsworth’s observation that “to the solid ground of nature trusts the Mind that builds for aye [forever]” — a line that appeared beneath the masthead of the scientific journal Nature for 75 years — captures this romantic ambition: the dream that building on nature’s foundations yields truths durable enough to transcend their discoverers.\n\nAnd yet, for many of us, when we think about scientific prestige, we cannot help but focus on the individual. Often, we imagine institutions such as Oxford or Harvard as metonyms for the “brilliant mind,” or perhaps envision a Nobel Laureate or Fields Medal winner. One component of this prestige is selectivity — from many, few are chosen. The same is true for scientific journals. While both journals and individuals project their prestige through reputation, journals have found ways to signal prestige through metrics such as impact factor, acceptance rate, and journal rankings; each suggesting the difficulty of publication and the likelihood that an individual’s work will receive institutional acclaim as a result.\n\nAt the dawn of the 19th century, approximately 100 scientific periodicals existed worldwide, and by its close, this number had risen to an estimated 10,000. Such growth marked a new era of independent scientific periodicals, distinct from traditional society publications. In such a competitive landscape, most of these publications clung to a tenuous existence, with prominent titles like The Reader (founded 1863) and Scientific Opinion (1864) struggling financially before ultimately folding. Even established and reputable periodicals, such as Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, which had enjoyed royal patronage since it was formally taken over by the Royal Society in 1752, rarely made money and struggled to publish without assistance.\n\nWhen Norman Lockyer and Alexander Macmillan launched Nature on November 4th, 1869, they did so amidst a graveyard of failed scientific periodicals. That Nature survived while so many publications collapsed reflects not only scientific merit, but patronage, elite networks, speed of publication, and a talent for capturing an international audience.\n\nFrom these advantages emerged not only a successful journal but also a system of prestige that continues to shape modern science. Prestige in this system is not simply a reflection of pure scientific merit, as one would hope, but a fiction that attempts to command attention in an era where the quantity of research far exceeds an individual’s capacity to assess it.\n\nToday, this system faces serious scrutiny, with many questioning whether selective journals serve science beyond merely rationing merit. Understanding how Nature’s prestige was constructed, however, can help clarify which elements are deserved and which are entrenched.\n\nMany of the features that would come to define Nature emerged in its earliest years. Survival was not inevitable, ultimately resting upon three contingent advantages: patronage that insulated it from commercial failure, elite networks that conferred early credibility, and a publication speed responsive to the increasingly competitive scientific environment.\n\nInitially, what distinguished Nature from its failed contemporaries was the patronage of Alexander Macmillan, who, alongside his brother, had built Macmillan & Co. into one of Britain’s most successful publishers. Flush from a remarkably profitable decade built on fiction, theological texts, and educational works, Macmillan was eager to expand his empire and could afford to absorb the financial losses that would have buried other periodicals (which he did, for the thirty years before Nature began turning a profit).\n\nMacmillan already knew Lockyer. Indeed, Lockyer’s Elementary Lessons in Astronomy (1868) had sold well for Macmillan, who then employed him as his most important “consulting physician in regard to scientific books and schemes.” Lockyer was at the zenith of his early career, co-discovering helium with Pierre Jules Janssen in 18681 and elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1869.\n\nHad Lockyer’s reputation not been what it was, Nature would have perished. Patronage secured survival, but credibility required connection. Lockyer’s prior editorship of The Reader had linked him to influential scientific circles, most notably the English biologist Thomas Huxley and the X-Club. This informal dining society of nine prominent scientists, formed in 1864 and meeting monthly, exercised considerable influence over British scientific institutions and publications, promoting scientific naturalism and working to establish science as a professional, secular discipline independent of ecclesiastical authority.\n\nHuxley, alarmed by scientific errors in popular books and frustrated by theological overtones he believed many journalists (particularly women) wove into their writing, concluded that only researchers themselves could properly educate the public. Through his enthusiastic support, Nature found an early contributor with an interest in scientific journalism unusual for a man of his scientific stature. Huxley, for his part, relished the attention, musing that when it came to journalism, he was “as spoiled as a maiden with many wooers.” Huxley also encouraged other prominent figures to contribute, even though they generally preferred to publish lengthy scientific essays in more established monthly periodicals.\n\nWhile attracting prominent contributors was beneficial, the early editorial approach of Nature was unconventional. Lockyer envisioned the journal serving two audiences: educated laypeople seeking accessible science and professional researchers eager to learn about the latest advances.\n\nAvoiding the abstract, passive voice of specialist journals, many popular articles in Nature were written in an accessible first-person, journalistic style. Observations from readers of a decidedly less technical nature were featured, including a report of a pigeon’s cunning method of procuring food by repeatedly startling a horse to shake grain from its nose-bag and an account of a goose raised by a Golden Eagle and taught “to eat flesh.”\n\nGradually, such whimsical observations yielded space to more technical book reviews and papers. Lockyer, who had hoped for favor from both the intellectually sophisticated layman and the scientific community, found that he mostly attracted the latter. Nature became a publication with short publication cycles and brief articles, with little elaboration or color.\n\nMany scientists viewed these changes positively, regarding Nature as an efficient means to highlight a scientific idea. Capturing this sentiment, William Crookes, who would later become President of the Royal Society and one of the discoverers of Thallium, requested in an 1895 letter to Lockyer that his paper on helium’s spectrum appear in Nature even though it would already be published in his own Chemical News: “my circulation is not to the same class of researchers as that of ‘Nature,’ and having taken a great deal of trouble about it I want the results to get to the right people.”\n\nNature had cultivated this readership of active researchers through publication speed: its weekly schedule made it essential reading for scientists tracking developments in increasingly competitive fields. As to why such speed was possible, one likely factor was economic. Macmillan absorbed the financial losses that more frequent publication required, losses that would have crippled competitors, while society journals generally operated on quarterly schedules tied to meeting proceedings, creating inherent publication delays.\n\nThe strategic utility of this model became evident in how researchers employed the journal. One example was George Romanes, a seminal figure of comparative psychology and popularizer of “neo-Darwinism,” who presented his theory of “physiological selection” to the Linnean Society in May 1886 before publishing detailed abstracts across three consecutive August issues of Nature to establish priority.\n\nThe success of Nature’s approach was recognized internationally, with the first editor of Science declaring his desire that it may “in the United States, take the position which Nature so ably occupies in England, in presenting immediate information of scientific events.”\n\nSpeed of publication would have meant little, of course, without credibility. Although Nature initially drew legitimacy from its X-Club connections, this proved fragile. Lockyer’s commitment to editorial independence conflicted with the Club’s expectation that the journal would reliably advance its interests. Disputes followed, beginning in 1872 with the Hooker-Owen controversy, where Nature published Joseph Hooker’s defense against Richard Owen’s accusations of mismanaging Kew Gardens, and then gave Owen space to respond with his rebuttal. Hooker, a prominent X-Club member, regarded the platforming of his opponent as an act of disloyalty, while Lockyer argued that the journal could not be “the mere mouthpiece of a clique.”\n\nThoroughly annoyed with Lockyer and losing much of their initial enthusiasm, the X-Club’s contributions to Nature began to decline, further isolating the publication’s lay readership by depriving them of the popular articles the Club had regularly provided. Yet this development did not significantly undermine Nature’s credibility within the scientific community. The X-Club still faced opposition from many important scientists who continued to contribute to the journal, while the Club’s own influence was waning due to internal conflicts and its aging membership, leading to its disbanding in 1892.\n\nMore significantly, a new generation of scientists was beginning to assume leadership of the British scientific community, and this cohort would include some of Nature’s most important and prolific contributors of the late nineteenth century, such as eminent zoologist Ray Lankester, physicist Oliver Lodge (a giant in radio communication), and George Romanes, a protégé of Darwin.\n\nUnlike their predecessors, whose preferred medium for scientific debate tended to be long-form periodicals, this new generation generally preferred Nature, often redirecting debate to its pages. Debates were structured, combative exchanges, featuring formal turn-taking and explicit rebuttals.\n\nOne noteworthy debate centered on Weismann’s theory of panmixia, which proposed that when an organ no longer conferred an evolutionary advantage, that organ would no longer be the subject of natural selection, leading it to diminish in size or vanish entirely. George Romanes endorsed this view in Nature, prompting Lankester to challenge him directly, arguing that a “useless” organ would be equally inclined to grow or diminish, and that panmixia could not account for reduction unless smaller size itself conferred an advantage. The exchange extended over eight weeks in Nature’s pages, with Romanes refusing to concede and instead insisting that Lankester fundamentally misunderstood his position.\n\nFor all its growing influence, Nature wasn’t yet particularly prestigious. It lacked the rigor of journals like Annalen der Physik or the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, finding survival through patronage and speed.2 At this time, Richard Gregory, an administrator rather than a practicing scientist, was hired as Nature’s editor-in-chief in 1919 — a smart choice given that many of Nature’s challenges were operational rather than scientific.\n\nSensible of his own limitations, Gregory had positioned himself not as a “man of science,” but as a “spokesman of science.” As a spokesman, Gregory was oriented more towards advocacy and would extend such efforts beyond Britain, positioning Nature as an international venue protecting scientific freedoms.\n\nStarting in 1933, for example, Nature began criticizing the Nazi regime for their expulsions of Jewish scientists. The Nazi regime banned the journal from German libraries in 1937. Gregory later defended this position forcefully, arguing that only “a German political official” would expect scientists to remain silent while respected colleagues were expelled “as the result of bitter racial prejudice.”\n\nThis pattern made Nature unusual among prominent journals: domestic contributions steadily declined over time. By 1933, half of Nature’s letters came from outside Britain. By contrast, Science remained predominantly American even later in the century (by 1980, only 15 percent of its experimental content came from abroad). In making Nature international when most other journals remained domestic, Gregory had established what would become a keystone of Nature’s future prestige.\n\nYet progress was fragile, with the international vision waning under Gregory’s successors, A.J.V Gale and Lionel “Jack” Brimble. Viewing their role as publishing “as many credible scientific papers — particularly ones from respectable British laboratories — as possible,” editorial selections became more domestic as English was displacing German and French as science’s lingua franca.\n\nThat said, their passive editorial approach meant they largely accommodated, rather than restricted, international submissions. By 1965, nearly 60 percent3 of all articles and letters originated from abroad. This shift was largely contributor-driven, as scientists worldwide continued to see Nature’s utility for gaining visibility and establishing priority findings.\n\nAdopting such a hands-off approach had consequences for editorial quality, however. Nature developed a reputation for printing almost anything that wasn’t demonstrably wrong, with editorial decisions often relying disproportionately on institutional prestige as a filter. One notable editorial misjudgment was the geophysicist Lawrence Morley’s seafloor spreading hypothesis, submitted from Canada in February 1963, which was dismissed by Nature’s referee as mere “talk at cocktail parties.” Seven months later, Vine and Matthew’s virtually identical hypothesis, bearing Cambridge credentials, sailed through to publication in what became known, with belated justice, as the Vine-Matthews-Morley hypothesis.\n\nStill not considered a particularly prestigious journal by the mid-1960s, Nature suffered from mediocre output, erratic refereeing, and publication delays that exceeded 14 months, eroding the speed that had once been one of its strongest competitive advantages.4 As geologist Drummond Matthews (of Vine-Matthews-Morley fame) would later recall, Nature “dropped into a sort of vacuum … American labs wouldn’t hear anything of it — thought it was all nonsense.”\n\nYet, Nature’s position within Britain’s scientific establishment still attracted significant breakthroughs, particularly in biological sciences, where the editors had actual expertise. Perhaps most famously, Watson and Crick’s 1953 DNA structure paper was accepted within three weeks, without external peer review, after Physics Nobel Laureate Lawrence Bragg sent a “strong covering letter” to the editors, whom he knew personally.5\n\nWith a reputation resting less on systematic editorial excellence and more on adjacency to transformative figures, Nature was — confusingly — both a second-tier outlet and a site for breakthroughs that reshaped entire fields.\n\nGifted this unhappy inheritance in 1966, editor John Maddox set about transforming Nature from survivor to standard-bearer, confronting a publication backlog of six months or more — nearly 2,000 manuscripts — left behind by Brimble and Gale’s passive editorial approach. He would first restore the submission processing speed that had deteriorated under his predecessors, pursuing a more assertive editorial strategy, and laying the foundation for the selectivity that would come to define Nature’s modern identity.\n\nTo speed up article processing, Maddox imposed discipline: instituting daily editorial meetings and introducing a streamlined index-card tracking system6 that sped up publication. By December 1966, he was even printing submission dates to signal the journal’s restored speed.7\n\nPerhaps the greatest departure from previous editorships was Maddox’s view that Nature was engaged in direct competition with other journals. Maddox pursued an editorial strategy that actively courted laboratory submissions, sometimes convincing authors to withdraw their manuscripts from rival periodicals.8 By courting higher-quality submissions and publishing them quickly, Maddox restored much of Nature’s reputation. This success did, however, create an issue: rising submissions overwhelmed the journal.\n\nUnfortunately for Maddox, this backfired. Authors in the satellite journals felt “demoted to the second division,” while British researchers appeared disproportionately in the flagship (over 50 percent) compared to the satellites (~33 percent), reinforcing perceptions of Nature as a “very British establishment journal.” When Nature recorded a financial loss at the end of 1972, Maddox was replaced.9\n\nIn 1973, Nature’s new editor, David Davies, scrapped the three-journal plan, returning to a single title while retaining Maddox's operational improvements. With submissions continuing to grow but channeled through one outlet rather than three, Nature rejection rates continued to rise. Authors sought out Nature not only for visibility but for the symbolic capital it conferred. For the aspiring scientist navigating an environment where funding had slowed and, in many fields, shrunk, publication in Nature represented a form of career insurance.\n\nHowever, exclusivity was an asset only if it was perceived as legitimate. Davies set out to reform the editorial process, moving it from the insular circles that had characterized earlier periods.\n\nWithin the first year of his editorship, Davies made peer review a requirement. Nature was late to this practice — American journals had been experimenting with peer review since the 1940s, and institutionalizing it since the 1960s — but the timing proved strategically important: U.S. academic departments increasingly demanded peer-reviewed publications for tenure decisions.\n\nUltimately, peer review didn’t transform Nature’s standing so much as protect it, converting exclusivity that might have seemed arbitrary into gatekeeping that appeared meritocratic.\n\nTogether, Davies and Maddox had directed a significant transformation. By the late 1970s, they had created the essential architecture of modern Nature — a highly selective, internationally oriented, generalist publication. This architecture allowed Nature publications to function as Schelling points,10 coordinating attention and providing shared references that researchers across disciplines could build on without extensive explanation. Nature’s prestige, in other words, derived less from gatekeeping quality than from solving a coordination problem.\n\nAnd by solving that problem, Nature became valuable as career insurance. Publication in Nature provided a universally recognized signal for hiring committees, grant reviewers, and colleagues. It also had scientific value, because breakthroughs often arise when researchers apply principles from their own discipline to another. A paper’s inclusion alongside others of unrelated inquiry thereby indicated that a scientist’s work wasn’t only impactful in their own field but contributed to science on the whole.\n\nDavies, who believed that staying in the same role too long led to personal stagnation, left Nature in 1980. To the surprise of many, including Davies, he was to be replaced by a returning Maddox, whose reappointment was facilitated by management changes at Macmillan, particularly the declining influence of one of its publishing executives, Jenny Hughes, who had orchestrated his prior exit.\n\nUpon returning, Maddox set out to establish Nature as the definitive publication for the international scientific community. By 1980, four-fifths of articles and letters already originated from outside Britain. Nature extended this reach by opening offices in Tokyo, Paris, Munich, and Hong Kong. International expansion was accompanied by increased selectivity. By the late 1980s, Nature’s acceptance rate had fallen to just 12.5 percent (down from 35 percent in 1974), making publication more highly coveted; for comparison, editor Daniel Koshland Jr. reported Science’s acceptance rate at approximately 20 percent in 1985.\n\nThroughout both editorships, Maddox had maintained a conviction that a scientific journal “should have an opinion on the state of science,” rather than serving as a passive conduit. During his first tenure, Maddox had personally taken over writing editorials, often at the last minute, to keep them current and provocative, and restructured the journal to place news and opinion prominently at the front. His second tenure would see a more direct approach, albeit sometimes controversially, such as when he personally investigated claims about homeopathy in 1988, drawing criticism for creating a “circus” atmosphere, and again when he deployed editorial skepticism against cold fusion claims the following year.\n\nDespite such blips, by 1995, Nature had largely solidified its position through its core strengths. Its selectivity made publication valued across the global scientific community. Its international reach connected researchers. Finally, its approval had become one of science’s most valued forms of validation.\n\nUpon assuming the editorship in 1995, Philip Campbell — a physicist who had spent the previous decade in science publishing, including as founding editor of the magazine Physics World — was tasked with preserving the legacy of Davies and Maddox as the journal transitioned from print to pixel. Through editorial independence, digital presence, and selective competitive engagement, Nature would continue to strengthen its institutional position.\n\nInstitutional security, however, often rested on foundations beyond Campbell’s direct editorial control. During Campbell’s editorship, Nature’s portfolio expanded significantly: though sub-journals had resumed under Maddox with Nature Genetics in 1992, Campbell’s tenure would see them increase in number from 3 in 1995, to 30 by 2018, with many more partner journals.11\n\nCampbell and other editors proposed or were consulted about new journal content; in the 2010s, he recalls supporting the initiation and early development of multidisciplinary thematic journals such as Nature Climate Change and Nature Sustainability. This devolved authority operated across multiple levels: issue-by-issue editorial decisions remained independent from corporate strategy, the journal and magazine maintained independence from one another, and individual Nature-branded journals operated independently from the flagship.12\n\nAnother significant development during Campbell’s tenure was the digitization of Nature content. Just as Davies had protected Nature’s standing through peer review — not by implementing it brilliantly, but by ensuring its absence couldn’t be used against the journal — digitization served a similar defensive function. Even though nature.com launched inauspiciously in 1995, with limited content, technical issues, and no full papers, its existence mattered more than its execution. This imperfect step, taken to be seen as modern and avoid anachronism, would prove foundational as scientific communication moved overwhelmingly online.\n\nCampbell’s control was primarily editorial; for example, he sought to boost Nature’s attention to research themes he felt were undersupported, expanding coverage of foundational themes like methodology and scientific integrity, as well as specific subject matter such as marine science and mental health. Campbell also initiated greater engagement with the social sciences across Nature’s magazine and journal content, which underpinned the subsequent expansion of multidisciplinary research in Nature and its thematic journals beyond the natural sciences.\n\nEditorial independence remained important, even when at odds with the publisher’s interests. One example of this independence was the Human Genome Project, an international project to sequence, map, and identify all human DNA. In 2000, Craig Venter’s Celera Genomics and the public Human Genome Project were completing their sequences, with Science pursuing both manuscripts. Venter insisted that some data remain behind a paywall (a position not considered heretical at the time). Campbell, however, refused these terms, judging it more important that data published in Nature remain publicly accessible, even at the risk of losing both sequences to Science. Venter did indeed go to Science, though Nature was able to publish the public project.\n\nSimilarly, when DORA (the Declaration on Research Assessment; an initiative advocating for the evaluation of research on its own merits rather than relying on journal metrics) launched in 2012, Nature abandoned a marketing campaign that had highlighted impact factor as a way to boost subscriptions. Campbell had been a longstanding critic of impact factor, though Nature had continued employing the metric in its marketing. Their public endorsement of DORA, however, cast this reversal as a matter of principle, giving Nature reputational capital for championing fairer evaluation practices. While this action carried some cost in absolute terms (abandoning a successful marketing lever isn’t nothing) Nature’s market position made this cost bearable, whereas it would have been prohibitive for a less established journal.\n\nPerhaps most unusual about Campbell was that he approached rivalry selectively. He was seemingly indifferent to ordinary competition, but would pursue landmark contests intensely. “I can honestly say that we spent little time looking at what other journals were doing,” he would later muse.13 But when the symbolic value justified a more intensive pursuit, such as the Genome Project, Nature would compete aggressively. Otherwise, Campbell operated with a “room for both” philosophy regarding Science, seeing each journal as serving its own constituency. This selective engagement reveals that Nature’s strength during this period came not from controlling everything, but from knowing what mattered for preserving its position.\n\nWhen Magdalena Skipper, the current editor-in-chief, succeeded Campbell in 2018, she commanded a journal whose reach and influence surpassed anything her predecessors had inherited. Yet the surrounding scientific ecosystem was also far less stable. Preprints had matured through platforms like bioRxiv and arXiv, the open science movement was gathering momentum with initiatives like Plan S14 and platforms such as PLOS ONE,15 and conventional scientific institutions faced mounting scrutiny.\n\nWhere Campbell had practiced selective indifference to competition, Skipper brought a different sensibility, actively monitoring rivals. Attentiveness to competition extended beyond traditional academic journals to include outlets such as The Guardian and Financial Times, all competing for mainstream public attention on scientific developments, particularly during the pandemic. Although Nature held scientific authority, these mainstream outlets commanded greater public reach.\n\nWhile Nature cannot beat these publishing giants on reach, Skipper’s ambition to foster “true multidisciplinarity” does extend its breadth. Throughout history, she observes, Nature has been “multidisciplinary primarily within the natural sciences.” Under Skipper, the journal has expanded into physical sciences, clinical research, social sciences, and engineering. Skipper’s guiding idea is that today’s most pressing questions demand collaboration across fields: “innovation often comes with an element of social sciences,” she says.16\n\nWidening the lens, however, doesn’t mean capturing everything. Skipper advocates for an “ecosystem with different publishing approaches: inclusive and selective.” Not everything requires Nature-level selectivity; there is value in venues for replication, negative results, and less conventionally interesting datasets. Publishing, she contends, is inseparable from research itself: “not thinking about publication when conducting research is a conceptual error,” as research without dissemination has limited value.\n\nFor the critic of scientific publishing, however, it’s the journal itself, no matter how inclusive or reformed, that is the problem. In June 2025, Astera Institute, a nonprofit research organization, announced it would no longer fund traditional journal publications. For Astera, the journal system has flaws so deeply entrenched that they resist reform: publications become final stamps of approval with mistakes rarely corrected, artificial scarcity fuels competition over collaboration, and articles don’t adapt as new evidence emerges, allowing flawed studies to mislead fields for decades.17\n\nWhile quite the indictment, there is merit to many of these complaints. As such, there are reforms that journals can implement that attempt to redress them. One especially illustrative example (although there are others) is retraction. Skipper considers it in Nature’s interest to “clean up [its] own pages.” She views retractions as visible evidence of vigilance rather than hidden embarrassment. Indeed, Springer Nature18 retracted 2,923 papers in 2024, with 61.5 percent addressing historical papers published before January 2023 as part of what the company describes as its commitment to “cleaning up the academic record.”\n\nThat said, these retraction efforts are not as thorough as they sound. This is because the complexity of removal processes and procedural requirements can override editorial judgment and stifle effectiveness. For example, in December 2016, independent researchers published an investigation uncovering nearly 300 fraudulent papers by two Japanese physicians, Yoshihiro Sato and Jun Iwamoto, across 78 journals. Among the publishers implicated was Springer Nature, which (as of 2024) had only retracted 13 of the 45 Sato-Iwamoto papers it had published.\n\nArguably more troubling was that at the Journal of Bone and Mineral Metabolism (a Springer Nature journal), only one of eleven papers was retracted, despite the editors recommending withdrawal, because the institutional investigation remained incomplete. Although the intention to reform may be sincere, procedural dependencies can override editorial judgment.19\n\nUnlike her predecessors, who established Nature as the central hub for international science, Skipper must now defend that position against emerging alternatives in a maturing ecosystem of preprints, open access mandates, and funder defection. What her predecessors could largely take for granted — that a selective, central venue served science well — is itself contested.\n\nUltimately, the question isn’t so much whether Nature deserves its prestige (history shows that much of its success has been circumstantial and opportunistic rather than meritorious) but whether the coordination function it now serves is sufficiently valuable to the scientific ecosystem.\n\nAfter all, in building its prestige, Nature became a vehicle for features that make scientific ecosystems function: international collaboration, multidisciplinarity, rigor and evaluation, and reach. Prestige may connote selectivity, but it speaks more to the broader question of what science is valuable and, as history demonstrates, that question was never answered by merit alone. Elite networks and well-endowed institutions may have shaped Nature’s ascension, but we should not mistake the system that emerged for one that reliably surfaces the best work.\n\nPrestige journals became a default filter, but even that may be fragmenting. As submissions outpace what peer review can absorb, prestige risks becoming a marker of scarcity rather than quality, while scientific discourse migrates to faster venues. Yet coordination without quality control is insufficient. Not all science is equally valuable, and not all scientists have the same amount of integrity. In the era of paper mills, AI slop, and epistemic pollution, whatever system comes next — whether prestige journals or something else entirely — must contend with how to navigate this noise. We have seen one way to do this and understand how we arrived there. We may well need another.\n\nRobert Reason is a Parliamentary Researcher.

Spun out of French insurance giant AXA in a 2018 IPO, Equitable’s leadership team was excited to be out on its own but quickly realized that to overcome inertia and remain relevant, the company’s ways of working would need to change.\nIn 2019, CEO Mark Pearson launched an effort known internally as New Ways of Working, or NWOW, aimed at helping the firm become faster, more accountable, and more adaptive in a highly competitive and regulated industry. Several years in, the effort sheds light on core leadership questions: What does true cultural change look like? What makes it last? And how do leaders bring skeptics along?

    "title": "\"Nvidia's New Vera Rubin Chips Are in 'Full Production'\"",
    "description": "The chip giant says Vera Rubin will sharply cut the cost of training and running AI models, strengthening the appeal of its integrated computing platform.",
    "fullText": "Huang says that the company’s next-generation AI superchip platform, Vera Rubin, is on schedule to begin arriving to customers later this year. “Today, I can tell you that Vera Rubin is in full production,” Huang said during a press event on Monday at the annual CES technology trade show in Las Vegas.\n\nRubin will cut the cost of running AI models to about one-tenth of Nvidia’s current leading chip system, Blackwell, the company told analysts and journalists during a call on Sunday. Nvidia also said Rubin can train certain large models using roughly one-fourth as many chips as Blackwell requires. Taken together, those gains could make advanced AI systems significantly cheaper to operate and make it harder for Nvidia’s customers to justify moving away from its hardware.\n\nNvidia said on the call that two of its existing partners, Microsoft and CoreWeave, will be among the first companies to begin offering services powered by Rubin chips later this year. Two major AI data centers that Microsoft is currently building in Georgia and Wisconsin will eventually include thousands of Rubin chips, Nvidia added. Some of Nvidia’s partners have started running their next-generation AI models on early Rubin systems, the company said.\n\nThe semiconductor giant also said it’s working with Red Hat, which makes open source enterprise software for banks, automakers, airlines, and government agencies, to offer more products that will run on the new Rubin chip system.\n\nNvidia’s latest chip platform is named after Vera Rubin, an American astronomer who reshaped how scientists understand the properties of galaxies. The system includes six different chips, including the Rubin GPU and a Vera CPU, both of which are built using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s 3-nanometer fabrication process and the most advanced bandwidth memory technology available. Nvidia’s sixth-generation interconnect and switching technologies link the various chips together.\n\nEach part of this chip system is “completely revolutionary and the best of its kind,” Huang proclaimed during the company’s CES press conference.\n\nNvidia has been developing the Rubin system for years, and Huang first announced the chips were coming during a keynote speech in 2024. Last year, the company said that systems built on Rubin would begin arriving in the second half of 2026.\n\nIt’s unclear exactly what Nvidia means by saying that Vera Rubin is in “full production.” Typically, production for chips this advanced—which Nvidia is building with its longtime partner TSMC—starts at low volume while the chips go through testing and validation and ramps up at a later stage.\n\n“This CES announcement around Rubin is to tell investors, ‘We’re on track,’” says Austin Lyons, an analyst at Creative Strategists and author of the semiconductor industry newsletter Chipstrat. There were rumors on Wall Street that the Rubin GPU was running behind schedule, Lyons says, so Nvidia is now pushing back by saying it has cleared key development and testing steps, and it’s confident Rubin is still on course to begin scaling up production in the second half of 2026.\n\nIn 2024, Nvidia had to delay delivery of its then-new Blackwell chips due to a design flaw that caused them to overheat when they were connected together in server racks. Shipments for Blackwell were back on schedule by the middle of 2025.\n\nAs the AI industry rapidly expands, software companies and cloud service providers have had to fiercely compete for access to Nvidia’s newest GPUs. Demand will likely be just as high for Rubin. But some firms are also hedging their bets by investing in their own custom chip designs. OpenAI, for example, has said it is working with Broadcom to build bespoke silicon for its next generation of AI models. These partnerships highlight a longer-term risk for Nvidia: Customers that design their own chips can gain a level of control over their hardware that the company doesn’t offer.\n\nBut Lyons says today’s announcements demonstrate how Nvidia is evolving beyond merely offering GPUs to becoming a “full AI system architect, spanning compute, networking, memory hierarchy, storage, and software orchestration.” Even as hyperscalers pour money into custom silicon, he adds, Nvidia’s tightly integrated platform “is getting harder to displace.”",

    "title": "This Tool Deletes Your Info From Data Broker Sites (If You Live in One State)",
    "description": "Even if you don't live in the Golden State, there are other ways to request that your information be deleted.",
    "fullText": "There's very little privacy on the internet: Data brokers collect tons of information about you and your online activity and sell it to anyone interested in marketing to you. California residents have gained more control over their personal data than those in other states since the passage of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in 2018, and they now have a one-stop shop for requesting that their information be removed from hundreds of data brokers registered with the state (and any that do so in the future).\n\nCalifornia isn't the only state to enact stronger consumer privacy laws in recent years, but its Delete Requests and Opt-Out Platform (DROP) is the first of its kind. The tool is live now, though brokers won't begin processing submissions until August. Here's what to do now if you live in California—and some options for removing your information from data brokers if you don't.\n\nTo get started with DROP, you'll need to confirm that you are, in fact, a California resident by verifying personal information via California Identity Gateway or signing in with Login.gov credentials. To be eligible, you must either live in California or be domiciled in the state even if you live elsewhere temporarily. (This is based on the location of your primary residence, where you are registered to vote, and which state issued your driver's license.)\n\nYou will then be able to create and submit a deletion request. You'll need to provide some personal data, which will be used to match your request with records held by data brokers. Data types include names, date of birth, zip codes, email addresses, phone numbers, Mobile Advertising IDs (MAIDs), and vehicle identification numbers (VINs). You can enter multiples of everything except your date of birth and update your request at a later time—if you get a new car or change your email, for example.\n\nWhile you can begin submitting requests now, know that data brokers won't actually begin processing them until August 2026 and could take up to 90 days from then to delete your data. If they find a match, they are required to delete all of the information they have about you, though there are some exceptions, such as data available through public records or provided directly to a business.\n\nOnce processing begins later this year, you'll be able to track the status of your request on the DROP platform.\n\nIf you don't reside in California and qualify for DROP, all is not lost—though you will have to invest a bit more time and/or money to remove your information from data broker sites than simply mass deleting via a single request.\n\nTo start opting out of data collection, download Consumer Reports' donation-based Permission Slip app, which tracks where your data can be found and follows up on removal requests. You can try to manually opt out by identifying data brokers and going directly to their sites, but this can be tedious, and there are a handful of other paid services that will do it for you. (None are perfect, nor do they guarantee 100% success.)\n\nWe also have a guide to blocking companies from tracking your online activities, which can help mitigate the problem somewhat before it begins.",

    "title": "What People Are Getting Wrong This Week: Is the World Ending in 2026?",
    "description": "Let's ring in the New Year with a doomsday prediction!",
    "fullText": "Many people think the world is going to end in 2026. Man people think the world is going to end every year—maybe because the Bible said so, or The Simpsons said so—but this 2026-doomsday prediction seems to have a scientific basis. In a 1960 issue of Science magazine, Austrian scientist and polymath Heinz von Foerster detailed what he called the “Doomsday Equation,” a model he used to calculate the last day of civilization on earth. According to von Foerster (and probably Homer Simpson), The End is coming on Friday, November 13, 2026.\n\nFoerster was not a crank. A pioneer in computer science, artificial intelligence, physics, biophysics, and other academic disciplines, von Foerster worked with the Pentagon, and was named a Guggenheim fellow twice—so he was a respected academic, and kind of a big deal. His Doomsday paper is very real. Here’s a link to it in the November 1960 issue of Science and a screenshot:\n\nThe Doomsday Equation looked at 2,000 years of historical data about how fast the earth’s population grew–-there were 2.7 billion people in 1960—and extrapolated a continually accelerating rate of growth. According to von Foerster, Humanity’s ability to overcome natural checks on population would result in hyperbolic growth—faster-than-exponential—an accelerating curve of population growth which would reach “infinite” on November 13 of this year, at which point there would be no space left on the planet for any more people to be. “Our great-great-grandchildren will not starve to death,” Von Forester said. “They will be squeezed to death.”\n\nSo should we pack it in and prepare for the End Times and death by suffocation? Actually the opposite. Von Foerster’s Doomsday Equation was meant to illustrate the problem of overpopulation, but he wasn’t being entirely serious with the specifics of his prediction; the math works out, but the conclusion is tongue-in-cheek.\n\nSo yes, he was joking—November 13, 2026 will fall on Friday (scary), and it also happens to be Heinz von Foerster's 115th birthday—but he was joking to make a point. In the early 1960s, the population was growing at an alarming rate. The annual growth rate had climbed from roughly 1.7% to 1.9% throughout the 1950s, and by 1963, it had grown to  2.3%. So what happened?\n\nIt turned out Von Foerster had a lot in common with fellow scientist Disco Stu of the Can’t Stop the Learnin’ Disco Academies:\n\nIronically, 1960–1963 was the peak of global growth rates. Von Foerster’s (perhaps sardonic) solution was a control mechanism for population—a “peoplo-stat” where governments would carefully monitor and control the rate of people being born. But thankfully, we didn’t need eugenics-lite to solve the problem—like the best problems, it solved itself.\n\nThe rate of world population growth began slowing, as you can see from this chart from macrotrends.net. and the much feared “population bomb” of the 1960s fizzled out. Increased urbanization meant that people had one child to send to an exclusive nursery school instead of having 10 children to work as farmhands. Better medical care means more children live, so there’s no need to make “spares.” The end result: Population growth slowed through the decades to around 1% in the 2010s. At present, according to the UN, more than half of all countries have negative population growth rates. If these trends continue, the world population will peak in the mid-2080s at around 10.3 billion people and then begin a slow decline.\n\nNovember 13, 2026, will come and go, and chances are very good that you will not starve to death, get hit by an asteroid, or suddenly be crushed under the weight of all these damn people (unless you’re on a subway at rush hour).\n\nAs for overpopulation: The problem isn't that there are too many of us, but too few. We don’t really know what it will mean for the worldwide rate of reproduction to go negative, but it’s likely to mean a lot of 90-year-olds hobbling around and everyone younger trying to figure out how to care for them.  But, like the best problems, it’s far enough in the future that someone else will have to deal with it.",

    "title": "Four Ways You Can Use Your Phone's USB-C Port (Besides the Obvious)",
    "description": "It's a versatile little port.",
    "fullText": "The USB-C charging port is likely to remain ubiquitous on phones for the foreseeable future—at least until the engineers at Apple figure out how to make the long-rumored portless iPhone—but this little socket is more versatile than you may have realized.\n\nHere are four other ways to put your USB-C port to use, no matter what your make and model of phone—from freeing up space on your handset to boosting your on-the-go productivity. It's almost like adding extra superpowers to your handset.\n\nYou can plug external USB storage devices of almost every description into your phone, just as you can with your laptop or desktop computer. Lifehacker has written before about how this works on an iPhone, and many Android phones offer the same functionality, with the default file browser app also able to see the external drive.\n\nYou may need an adapter of some description, and you may need to make sure the USB drive is formatted in a particular way (a quick web search for the details for your particular phone model will tell you if this is the case). but often, you can just plug in your drive and the phone will figure out what's what.\n\nThis is a helpful for backing up photos and videos without paying a monthly fee for cloud storage, or simply to free up some storage space on your device. It's also a quick and easy way of getting files onto your phone, whether that's audio or video files you want to play without having to stream them, or books or documents you need to review during a long trip when you won't be able to rely on getting a good signal.\n\nMany handsets—the latest iPhones and Pixel phones included—can output video over a USB-C connection. One scenario where this is useful is if you're in a hotel room and you want to get a movie up on the room television without having to mess with wifi or streaming protocols.\n\nThis can be quite fiddly in terms of the cables you need and how they attach to the TV, but if you do some research around your particular phone model and the inputs you want to connect to, you should be able to get it working without too much trouble. Here's Apple's guide for the cables and adapters you need for the iPhone, for example.\n\nIf you have a Samsung Galaxy device, then it will probably support Samsung DeX. This is a desktop environment (like Windows or macOS) that you can run on an external monitor or TV from your phone, enabling you to not only play videos on the larger display, but also use social media, web browsing, and productivity apps too.\n\nThere are some great mobile games around for iOS and Android, but using touchscreen controls can be awkward: You're just about to blast an alien spaceship out of existence when you tap the wrong part of the display and turn down the brightness instead. It's not ideal, but a dedicated gaming controller can help.\n\nLifehacker has covered some of these controllers in the past, and many can hook up via your phone's USB-C port—giving you a solid and stable connection to the gaming action without any lag. You won't need to charge the controller either if it's hooked up via USB-C, as it'll use the power coming from your phone's battery.\n\nOne of the best examples of this is the $99.99 Backbone One controller. It works with Android phones and iPhones, and gives you a gaming boost in titles such as Fortnite and Call of Duty. It can also work really well if you're streaming games from your Microsoft or Sony console to your phone over wifi.\n\nThere are yet more peripherals you can plug into your smartphone, including two that can harness its versatility as a productivity device: a mouse and a keyboard. This works on a broad range of iPhone and Android handsets—here are the instructions for plugging a wired mouse into a Samsung Galaxy phones, for instance. (You can also connect these peripherals via Bluetooth.)\n\nAdmittedly you're probably not going to dig out a full size keyboard every time you send a text message, but if you've got a lot of emails or a long report to write while you're on the go, a travel keyboard can be very helpful. If you've got a foldable phone with a larger screen, then you've got yourself a decent portable workstation.\n\nIt's even possible to connect up a mouse and a keyboard together via a USB-C hub, with maybe a memory card slot as an added bonus. Just keep an eye on power usage: If you're connecting multiple accessories, look for a hub that you can also connect your charger to, so your phone battery isn't constantly running down.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Rescue Retriever Wants to Help Firefighters Find Your Pets in a Fire",
    "description": "The silent smoke detector has a strobe light to help locate your pets.",
    "fullText": "No pet owner wants to think about what might happen to their animal friend in the event of a fire. As a dog owner, I know I don't. But fires do happen, and pets can't follow your family fire plan. Rescue Retriever wants to change that. I spoke with the company during CES' Pepcom event, and learned how it's working to make it easier for firefighters to find your pets in the event of a fire. (Rescue Retriever first launched back in March of 2024. The company was started by two brothers—one of whom is a former firefighter.)\n\nDuring a fire, pets tend to run to where they feel safe—maybe that's under the bed, or somewhere tucked away in a room. That makes it difficult for firefighters to locate pets during an emergency: In a situation where seconds count, they don't have the ability to search every corner of a burning home. Unfortunately, as a result, pets sometimes don't make it out. Rescue Retriever wants to change that.\n\nIn an attempt to solve that problem, Rescue Retriever's smoke detector works a bit differently. It isn't supposed to be placed where your current smoke detector is; rather, the idea is to place it where your pet is most likely to go when scared. If you know they like to hide under your bed, for example, you can place the detector there. Once the device detects smoke during a fire, a bright light begins to strobe inside, spread out by a mix of holes placed throughout the device. (Even under the bright lights of Pepcom, the strobe looked intense to me.) That way, firefighters can look out for the strobing lights when trying to locate pets in your home. There's even an accompanying sticker you can place on your home's window, so firefighters know you have a pet to look out for.\n\nThe device is silent, so as to not scare your pets away from their hiding space. It wouldn't do any good to have a beacon for firefighters to locate your pet, only to have them scurry off because of an alarm.\n\nNew from the company this year is the Fire Tag, which brings the strobe light from the main unit to a small tag you can place on your pet's collar. The tag syncs up to the main unit using RFID. When the main unit detect smoke and starts strobing, the Fire Tag will pick up the signal and follow suit.\n\nIt's great that the main unit doesn't make a noise to scare your dog, but that doesn't guarantee they will go to the spot where the smoke alarm is installed—maybe the house smoke alarm scares them again or they don't follow their usual pattern and hide somewhere away from where you placed the main unit. Having a Fire Tag on their collar would give firefighters a better shot at locating the pet, wherever they may be in the home.\n\nRescue Retriever tells me these tags have a range of up to a quarter mile, so if your dog runs away from your house, their collar might still light up. Even still, the Fire Tag opens up, allowing you to place a tracker like an AirTag inside, so if your dog runs out of that quarter mile range, you can still track them if they come within Bluetooth range of a device within the Find My network.\n\nRescue Retriever says the Fire Tag is ready for production, and, when available, can be purchased either individually ($29.99), or as part of a larger bundle with the main Rescue Retriever unit ($89.99). The main unit can be purchased now for $39.99, but it also comes in bundles with accessories for varying prices.",

    "title": "This Personalized Running Spreadsheet Is My Tech Upgrade of the Week",
    "description": "Use my template below, or grab a blank spreadsheet and start logging now.",
    "fullText": "There's something deeply satisfying about tracking your running progress in a spreadsheet you built yourself. No algorithm showing off other people's workouts, no concerns about what happens to your data if the company pivots or shuts down. Just you, your numbers, and a system designed exactly the way you want it. And when I wrote about this earlier this year, I received some truly heartwarming messages from runners who'd been thinking the same thing. So many of us runners are tired of relying on apps, and we're instead drawn to a simple, customizable spreadsheet.\n\nSure, there's no shortage of fitness tracking apps out there. Strava, Garmin Connect, Nike Run Club—they all have their strengths. But owning your own spreadsheet offers something different: complete control. You can design your system to match your specific training needs. I also appreciate the intentionality that gets introduced when you have to design your own tracking system.\n\nThere's also the simple economics. Spreadsheets are free. They don't have premium tiers, they don't expire when you stop paying, and they don't suddenly lock features you've been using for months. Plus, creating custom charts and graphs to visualize your progress becomes a matter of a few clicks rather than hoping the app updates to include the exact view you're looking for.\n\nThis is not the first spreadsheet I've shared with my Lifehacker community, but this might be my magnum opus: a running tracker that logs every workout, calculates weekly mileage automatically, visualizes training load over time, and helps me plan toward specific race goals. It's evolved over months of use, shaped by what actually matters when I lace up my shoes each morning.\n\nHere she is. If the idea of a spreadsheet appeals to you, but you hate my spreadsheet, that's fine! I'm not even crying about it! Let's take a look at how you can perfect your own DIY running tracker.\n\nThe key to a sustainable running spreadsheet is tracking what actually helps you without drowning in data entry. Here's what I've found worth logging:\n\nThe essentials: Date, distance, time, and pace. These four fields form the backbone of any useful running log. They let you calculate weekly mileage, monitor whether you're getting faster, and spot trends over time.\n\nThe context: Route or location, weather conditions, and how you felt during the run. These qualitative details help you understand the story behind the numbers. That slower pace might make sense when you remember it was 95 degrees, or you were running hills, or you resolved to run slower now in order to run faster later.\n\nThe training details: Type of run (easy, tempo, intervals, long run), elevation gain if relevant to your training, and any specific workout structure. This helps you ensure you're balancing different types of training rather than just logging junk miles.\n\nWhat I don't track: Every single calorie burned (those estimates are notoriously unreliable anyway).\n\nStart simple. Create columns for your essential data and add a few basic formulas: total weekly mileage, average pace for the week, maybe a running total for the month. Google Sheets and Excel both make this straightforward, and you can always add complexity later.\n\nConsider organizing with separate tabs for different purposes. I keep one tab as my main running log where each row represents a workout, another tab for monthly summaries that automatically calculate totals and averages, and a third for goal tracking where I can see my progress toward specific races or mileage targets.\n\nThe beauty of building your own system is that you can iterate. After a month of tracking, you'll notice what information you actually reference and what just clutters the spreadsheet. Maybe you thought you'd care about cadence but never look at that column, or perhaps you wish you'd been tracking which shoes you wore to monitor when they need replacing. Adjust accordingly.\n\nNumbers in rows tell one story, but charts and graphs reveal patterns you might otherwise miss. Create a simple line graph showing your weekly mileage over time and you'll instantly see when you're ramping up training, when you backed off for recovery, and whether your current volume is sustainable.\n\nI like having a few standard visualizations: a line chart of weekly mileage, a bar graph comparing monthly totals across the year, and a scatter plot showing the relationship between distance and pace to spot my comfortable running ranges. None of this requires advanced spreadsheet skills—most programs will generate decent charts automatically once you select your data.\n\nThe point here isn't to use my exact system, but to recognize that you can build something better suited to your needs than any one-size-fits-all app. Your training is unique to you—your goals, your schedule, your body, your definition of progress. Why not track it in a way that reflects that? Keep what works, discard what doesn't, and enjoy this life upgrade.",

I didn't deserve it. I literally didn't do it out of fear.”\n\nThe musician also revealed he was hospitalized. “Even before I got into getting my blood work done, I went and got mental health therapy about my overeating. I started treating my food addiction like what it was: an addiction. Why did I treat cocaine a certain way? I went to meetings for cocaine and found a sponsor and detoxed off of it and s*** myself and went through real hard life-changing emotional choices to get off cocaine and codeine,\" Jelly Roll shared. \"I didn’t look at the food addiction different. Once I started treating food like an addiction, it started changing everything for me.\"\n\nThough Jelly Roll didn’t use GLP-1, he was prescribed metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes. Keep scrolling to learn more about the drug and how it helped the singer lose weight.\n\nJelly Roll Reveals He Can Fit in Louis Vuitton Amid Weight Loss Journey: ‘Pray for My Bank Account’\n\nAccording to Harvard Health, the drug was approved for use in Europe in 1959 and in the United States in 1995. It is the most widely used drug for the treatment of diabetes for people who cannot control their blood sugar through diet and exercise.\n\nHarvard Health also noted that the drug has other benefits. These include the treatment of prediabetes (the drug can delay the onset of symptoms), gestational diabetes (which some pregnant women develop), polycystic ovarian syndrome (the drug can help regular the menstrual cycle), and weight gain from the use of antipsychotic medicines.\n\nResearchers are also currently studying if the drug can help lower the risk of cancer for people who have type 2 diabetes, lower the risk of dementia and stroke and prevent age-related diseases.\n\nJelly Roll worked with nurse practitioner Danese Raxroad, who treated him through Ways2Well. Jelly Roll was diagnosed with levels of insulin he described to Men’s Health as “super high.”\n\n“Insulin is designed to help glucose enter the cell,” Raxroad told the outlet. “When you have an excessive amount of insulin, it forces your body to store fat. So switching those receptors and switching what Jelly’s body was signaling with insulin helped him rapidly adjust his insulin resistance. I wasn’t doing a big science experiment. It was just meal timing and eating real foods.”\n\nThe goal for Jelly Roll was that the drug would help reduce his triglycerides, the fat cells in his blood.\n\nLike many drugs, metformin does have side effects. According to Harvard Health, these can include minor gastrointestinal problems such as stomach upset and nausea; some people can also have a severe allergic reaction or suffer from lactic acidosis, a build up of lactic acid in the bloodstream.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Apple HomePod User Should Know",
    "description": "Get more out of Apple's smart speaker.",
    "fullText": "The HomePod is one of the most polarizing Apple devices I've ever owned. When it works, it's awesome, but if anything goes wrong, it can be a bit of a head-scratcher to troubleshoot. That's led to a bit of a mixed reception among Apple fans, but I've been buying HomePods since 2017, and know all the hacks to help make them easier or better to use. Some of these hacks are geared towards trouble-free usage, but others highlight hidden features. Let's dive right in.\n\nIn all my experience with HomePods, I've observed that the product just works a lot better when it's in a place with a strong wifi signal. For a few months, I'd kept the HomePod in a bedroom where my wifi was a bit flaky, and the speaker did not perform well at all. Since it uses either the internet or AirPlay to play sound, it needs a strong wifi signal. If your house has a single router, you may have better luck connecting your HomePod to the 2.4GHz band as opposed to the 5GHz option, which has a shorter range.\n\nYou can check which network your HomePod is connected to by going to the Home app on your iPhone, selecting your HomePod, and going to Accessory Settings. The smart speaker automatically connects to the same network that your iPhone or iPad is connected to. You can switch the wifi network on your iOS device to change the connected wifi on the HomePod.\n\nSince we're talking about increasing the reliability of your HomePod, you'll find that pairing it with your Apple TV will make it far less flaky. This is not to say that you should go out and buy an Apple TV just to make your HomePod work better, but if you do have the streaming device, you should consider pairing it with your HomePod for the best results.\n\nI've used my HomePods with my iPhone, Mac, iPad, and even my Apple Watch, and I can tell you that the experience is just not the same as when using the speaker with an Apple TV. For starters, the Apple TV can use a HomePod as a default output, which means that you don't have to fiddle with software buttons or use Siri to operate the speaker. You just switch on your Apple TV, play anything you like, and the HomePod will just work. That may sound like a minor benefit, but it's really not. I don't have many good things to say about the HomePod's software and reliability, and it's only been 100% solid when I've used it with an Apple TV.\n\nI don't usually tell people to spend more money to make the most of a product, but in the case of Apple's HomePods, two speakers are a lot better than just one. If you have the bigger HomePod, you'll probably be fine with just one of those, but that's not true for those of us who have opted for a HomePod mini. Using two HomePod minis in a stereo pair is a much better experience, taking what can be underwhelming audio and letting it play with the big boys. And that goes double if you followed through on that last hack. If you have an Apple TV, you're going to be really impressed when connecting it to two HomePods in a stereo pair. It makes watching movies so much better.\n\nHDMI ARC is one of the least-known features of the HomePod, but once you try it, there's no going back. In a nutshell, it lets you use the HomePod as a speaker for your PS5, Xbox, or any other device connected to your TV. It requires a pretty specific combination of hardware to work, and even after having that in place, you may have to troubleshoot it a bit to get it working correctly. This is because there are at least four different devices made by different manufacturers involved here. Sometimes you might need to manually enable ARC, eARC, or HDMI-CEC in your TV's settings, which usually does the trick.\n\nThis Apple Support page highlights everything you need to make this feature work, which boils down to having an Apple TV 4K (second-gen or newer), a HomePod or a HomePod mini, and a TV that supports HDMI ARC or eARC (usually, TV manufacturers label the HDMI ports to indicate support for these technologies). You'll have to enable this feature on your Apple TV first, and once you do that, the HomePod should play sound from other devices connected to your TV. Note that you need to add the Apple TV and the HomePod to the same \"room\" in the Home app on your iPhone to make this feature work.\n\nThe good news is that this setup is a one-time headache, and once it's done, it works without much trouble.\n\nIf you have more than one HomePod of the same type, you can and should try using them for multi-room audio. Three HomePods (or HomePod Minis) are good enough to cover an apartment of around 1000 sqft, and you can use them to have music playing in every room as you go about your day. If you have a Mac, you could also get the excellent SoundSource app to test how much you like multi-room audio without having to buy multiple HomePods first, too. SoundSource lets you send audio to multiple devices at once, which means that you can play the same audio file on generic Bluetooth speakers, HomePods, AirPods, and any other audio devices connected to your Mac, at the same time.\n\nYou can use this to get a feel for how multi-room audio sounds, and if you like the experience, you can use multiple HomePods to have the same experience with minimal latency.\n\nYou can use your HomePod to send voice messages to other people in your house. For instance, you can send the following command to Siri: \"Intercom, it's time for dinner.\" This will send your dinner reminder message to all HomePods in the house. Others can use Siri to reply to you as well, making it an effective alternative to sending texts.\n\nYou can access the intercom function by opening the Home app on your iPhone, holding down the HomePod icon, and selecting Accessory Settings > Intercom. It also works with Siri on your iPhone, so you can send an intercom message to a HomePod even when it's not nearby.\n\nApple's HomeKit smart home platform may not be as popular as its competition, but there are some good HomeKit-compatible smart home accessories out there. If you find the right products, you can use the HomePod to control your entire house. This includes lights, doors, cameras, and many other types of smart home gadgets. Of course, all of these features are heavily dependent on Siri, which means that you'll occasionally have to repeat your commands or deal with the wrong gadget being switched on or off.\n\nAlthough Siri can be frustrating to deal with, HomeKit is the best option for people who want a privacy-focused smart home platform. Apple tries its best to minimize data sent to external servers and encrypts security footage, which is different from the approach many competing platforms have chosen.\n\nIn my experience, it's worth it to take some time to figure out the best place to put your HomePod, particularly for the best stereo output. Apple recommends placing your HomePod up to 10 inches away from a wall, but in my experience, it works best if it's about 6-10 inches from walls. For the best stereo experience, you should place your two HomePods on either side of your TV, not more than 4 feet from each other.\n\nIf you have expensive wood furniture, be sure to check if it's safe to place the HomePod on those surfaces. Sometimes, HomePods can leave a mark on wooden surfaces, so you can consider using a cork trivet to protect the surface.\n\nIf you've previously enabled sharing analytics data with Apple, your HomePod could be sending audio of your Siri interactions to Apple's servers. You should review this and disable the feature if you don't want to share this data. Open the Home app on your iPhone, hold the HomePod icon, and go to Accessory Settings. Now, go to Analytics & Improvements and disable all options on this page. On the Accessory Settings page, you can also go to Siri History and select Delete Siri History to clear out previously stored data.\n\nThe HomePod also supports automation routines, and you can use these to do lots of fun things. For about a year, I'd set up my HomePod to play calming music in the mornings and some jazz at sunset. You can set these up in Apple's Shortcuts app. Go to the Automation section, tap the + button, and select Create Home Automation. This is where you can set up your favorite automation routines. The HomePod supports executing actions when you reach or leave your home, at a specific time of the day, when accessories are connected, or when a sensor detects something (eg: motion).",

    "title": "CES 2026: Pawport's Smart Dog Door Launched With One Big Upgrade",
    "description": "This is almost the same pet door I saw last year, except for one major update.",
    "fullText": "If you've been following smart pet tech closely over the last couple years, you might know Pawport. I saw the company's smart pet door at the last two CES's, and was my first introduction to this specific product category. At the time, Pawport hadn't yet launched; now they have. But there's one key difference between the pet door Pawport showed off at CES 2025, and the one that eventually launched late last year.\n\nIn a lot of ways, Pawport's official pet door is the product I saw last year: Pawport is made of aluminum, and is reportedly bulletproof. (The company has a model riddled with bullet holes on display). This smart door is designed to fit over an existing pet door in your home. If you don't have one, the company also sells an insert to install into your wall. It's weatherproof, has deadbolts on the top and bottom for security, and connects to smart home and voice control assistants. It can even work on battery power, though you can also plug it into power.\n\nBut Pawport tells me the big change between last year's prototype and its official launch model is the technology used in the smart tag that attached to your pet's collar. Now, Pawport uses a type of ultra-wideband (UWB) technology to communicate between the tag and the door. That gives the user more control over things like how far your pet has to be from the door before it opens: Maybe you prefer your dog to be two feet away inside before it opens, but five feet away when outside. Pawport says UWB also gives the door more security than before. Now, the tech enables end-to-end encryption between the dog collar and the door, so, according to the company, the door can't be hacked. It's a bold claim, but, if true, that should give pet owners some peace of mind.\n\nPawport now also gives pet owners control over whether pets can run outside in adverse weather conditions. If there's rain or lightning, users can configure the app to lock the door from the inside, so pets can't scurry off into an unsafe backyard. That only locks one way, as well, so if the pet is already outside when the weather lock takes effect, they can still get back inside.\n\nIn addition, the company tells me that UWB has extended the battery life of the tag this go around. While the previous prototype was rated for around six months of battery life, the new model has an advertised battery life of one year, though users could see their batteries lasting up to 15 to 18 months.\n\nPawport plans to eventually sell a dedicated outdoor pet door as well, but at the moment, it only sells the indoor unit. That starts at $599 for the company's six standard colors in their medium sized unit, and $849 for one of eight \"signature series\" designs, which adds a polished wood look to the door. You can upgrade to a large unit for another $50, or the extra large unit for an extra $100.",

    "title": "Russian Shahed-136 Kamikaze Drones Now Carrying MANPADS Missiles",
    "description": "The Shahed-136 is now toting a shoulder-fired heat seeking missile as Russia continues to expand the drone’s capabilities.",
    "fullText": "Russia is continuing to adapt and evolve its copies of the Shahed-136 long-range one-way attack drone, known locally as the Geran, now arming it with a man-portable air defense system (MANPADS). These are more often referred to as shoulder-fired heat-seeking missiles. The development follows a previous version of the drone carrying a single R-60 air-to-air missile, which you can read more about here. It also emerges as Russia makes additional alterations to the drone, including improved line-of-sight control capabilities and self-protection systems.\n\nRussian forces are mounting Igla MANPADS on Shahed drones to target Ukrainian helicopters that intercept them. The drones carry a camera and radio modem, and the missile is launched remotely by an operator in Russian territory. pic.twitter.com/T5TKPHyhVu\n\n— WarTranslated (@wartranslated) January 4, 2026\n\nAn example of a MANPADS-equipped Shahed/Geran is seen in recent imagery, including a video, that shows the drone lying in the snow, after it came down intact in Ukraine, reportedly in the Chernihiv region in the north of the country. According to Ukrainian accounts, as well as the rail-mounted missile on the top, the drone is equipped with a camera and a radio-frequency modem.\n\nThe missile itself has been widely reportedly as an Igla-S, among the latest models of this widespread MANPADS. Known in Russia as the 9K388, and to NATO as the SA-24 Grinch, the weapon has a maximum range of around 3.7 miles, and improvements over earlier Igla missiles include a more sensitive infrared seeker, a heavier warhead, and an improved fuze.\n\nOn the other hand, the inscription on the top of the launch tube appears to read 9K333, which would indicate it is the more modern Verba (SA-29 Gizmo), which was developed as a replacement for the Igla. Its primary advantage is its advanced multispectral seeker, operating in the ultraviolet, near infrared, and mid-infrared bands, for improved discrimination between targets and decoys.\n\nAdapting the MANPADS to the Shahed/Geran appears more straightforward than the R-60, with no need for the launch rail adapter; instead, the MANPADS is simply attached to the drone within its standard launch tube. The complete Igla, for example, is also much lighter: around 40 pounds in its tube, compared to close to 100 pounds for the R-60, minus the launch rail.\n\nInterception of the Russian Shahed kamikaze drone with an installed R-60 air-to-air missile. \n\nIt was intercepted by Darknode unit of the @usf_army, using STING anti-Shahed drone developed by the @wilendhornets and funded by @sternenkofund. https://t.co/XHEjuCP31F pic.twitter.com/oje4VOXTbz\n\n(@bayraktar_1love) December 1, 2025\n\nRussia started employing Shahed/Geran-type long-range UAVs equipped with air-to-air missiles for combating Ukrainian aviation assets, Ukrainian military radio technology expert Serhii Flash reports.\n\nThe remains of a Shahed/Geran-type drone with an R-60 short-range air-to-air… pic.twitter.com/NHBDQQqCK9\n\n— Status-6 (War & Military News) (@Archer83Able) December 1, 2025\n\nAs for the drone, the original Shahed-136 is Iranian in origin. Multiple variants and derivatives of the Shahed-136, including a jet-powered type, are now produced in large numbers in Russian factories, where they are known locally by the name Geran, the Russian word for geranium. Steady improvements have been made to these drones, including a degree of dynamic targeting capability, as you can read about here.\n\nAs we have discussed in the past, adding a heat-seeking anti-aircraft missile to the Shahed/Geran in theory provides the drone with a means to engage Ukrainian fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. At the very least, giving the drone the ability to hit back at these threats offers a deterrent capability. Overall, the effectiveness of this combination is questionable. Particular challenges include the need for a high degree of situational awareness, perhaps requiring cameras around the airframe, and the need to maneuver the drone to get it into a boresight location to achieve a lock-on. However, Russia clearly considers that the adaptation is worth exploring, even just as a deterrent strategy to keep drone hunting aircraft at bay.\n\nFor some time now, Russia has been working on a man-in-the-loop (MITL) control capability for the Shahed/Geran, a feature that was confirmed when they started to appear with cameras and cellular modems, something TWZ explored in detail at the time. These developments allow the drone to be connected to an operator. Standard Shaheds fly autonomous routes to pre-planned targets on autopilot with no man-in-the-loop control. They are ‘fire and forget’ weapons.\n\nMeanwhile, the range at which MITL can be achieved has been steadily increased. At first, the drones were adapted to exploit patchy cellular networks to provide additional connectivity when available. More recently, Shaheds have been flying with antennas allowing for direct line-of-sight control close to the front lines. This allows them to hit targets dynamically like an FPV drone, while packing a much heavier punch and being able to loiter for long periods of time. You can read all about this development here. Now, the datalink range is being extended using airborne signal relays, possibly creating a mesh network with multiple line-of-sight links. We are also now seeing Russian drones will Starlink terminals, which could provide a vastly superior beyond-line-of-sight capability and could prove to be a big problem for Ukraine if Russia can produce such a configuration in large volumes. These developments are now blurring the classification of the Shahed/Geran from its original long-range one-way attack drone to a loitering munition, with an onboard imaging capability.\n\nA Russian Molniya drone with a Starlink terminal.https://t.co/9Tb8GTx1nI pic.twitter.com/zmbpgMGwXm\n\n— Rob Lee (@RALee85) December 15, 2025\n\nPotentially, a Shahed/Geran armed with a MANPADS or an R-60 could use beyond-line-of-sight capabilities to operate the missile. But bearing in mind we know Russia is using the drones closer to the front lines, this would need only a line-of-sight link with operators near the front, or at least by receivers/transmitters placed there. Drone controllers behind the lines could also ‘pick them up’ once in the area, but such an operation is far more complex and fraught with additional risks.\n\nNew article: Networking the Shahed \n\nHow Russia’s datalink-enabled Geran-2s are evolving beyond the traditional one-way attack UAV concept.https://t.co/HluZ7dDulH pic.twitter.com/ZqXpAl2NiC\n\n— Fabian Hinz (@fab_hinz) January 4, 2026\n\nNevertheless, target acquisition and engagement of a missile-armed drone is still far from straightforward. It’s likely that the modern seeker used by the Igla-S or Verba makes it easier to engage aerial targets, compared to the R-60, with a reduced need to ‘point’ the drone directly at the target. Still, the operator would have to trigger the launch of the missile after receiving the signal indicating a lock-on has been achieved.\n\nAt the same time, the Shahed/Geran remains a slow and not particularly agile launch platform, and certainly not one that was designed with air-to-air combat in mind. Adding a top-mounted missile likely also degrades its maneuverability and affects its stability, but less than would be the case with an R-60.\n\nWhen it comes to finding aerial targets, the most likely scenario involves operating entirely reactively to what is seen visually on cameras around the drone or otherwise searching for targets of opportunity. Another option would involve the drone operator receiving target information from offboard assets, where applicable, but this seems less likely.\n\nBearing in mind the performance of the Shahed/Geran and the range of the MANPADS, the most likely targets would be the Mi-8/Mi-17 Hip series armed transport helicopters and the Mi-24 Hind series gunships that are routinely tasked with counter-drone missions. We have already seen that lower and slower-flying helicopters face a notable risk from relatively small kamikaze drones that simply fly into them. Ukrainian F-16s, MiG-29s, Su-27s and Mirage 2000s have also been tasked heavily as ‘Shahed hunters,’ but engaging fighters with these weapons would be even tougher. Still their very existence would add a credible threat to fighters approaching them.\n\nFootage showing the door gunner on a Mil Mi-8 Multirole Helicopter with the Ukrainian Air Force using his M134 Minigun to shoot down a Russian Shahed-136 Attack Drone. pic.twitter.com/UWBd8QUXEf\n\n— OSINTdefender (@sentdefender) November 12, 2025\n\nWhile it remains to be seen just how effective the combination of Shahed/Geran with a MANPADS (or R-60) is, these developments reflect a previous precedent for arming drones with air-to-air missiles. The deterrent effect of this can be seen in at least one instance from 2002, when a U.S. Air Force MQ-1 Predator drone fired a Stinger heat-seeking anti-air missile at an Iraqi MiG-25 Foxbat fighter that was trying to shoot it down, which can be seen in the video below.\n\nThese measures are also indicative of efforts being made by Russia to better defend the Shahed/Geran drones. Another recent development involves the apparent addition of infrared countermeasures to defeat drone interceptors and possible missiles fired by fighters. Attached to the rear of the drone’s stabilizing endplates, these appear to employ electrically heated cylindrical blocks to generate blooming infrared energy, like the Hot Brick system.\n\nUkrainian military radio technology specialist and consultant Serhii “Flash” Beskrestnov reported that Russian Geran-2 drones are now capable of blinding interceptor drones and aircraft. \n\nAccording to him, the Russians are equipping their strike UAVs with infrared searchlights.… pic.twitter.com/dtpnbKIklE\n\n— OSINTWarfare (@OSINTWarfare) January 3, 2026\n\nFor now, we have no evidence of a missile-equipped Shahed/Geran attempting to engage a Ukrainian aircraft, let alone bringing one down. However, having long-range one-way attack drones fitted with air defense missiles provides another complicating factor for Ukraine and illustrates the continued modifications being made to these weapons.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

    "fullText": "NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) — New Haven’s police chief abruptly retired following allegations he stole money from a department account, Mayor Justin Elicker announced Monday.\n\nThe Democrat said Chief Karl Jacobson admitted he took money from a city fund that compensates confidential informants for helping police solve crimes.\n\nHe said the chief acknowledged taking the funds for personal use when three of his deputies confronted him Monday morning over the financial irregularities.\n\nElicker called the allegations “shocking\" and a “betrayal of public trust.”\n\n“No one is above the law,\" he said in an evening press conference at the police station. “We put our trust in law enforcement to uphold the law, not to violate the law themselves.”\n\nJacobson didn’t immediately return an email seeking comment Monday. He had served as police chief in one of Connecticut’s largest cities and home to Yale University for more than three years.\n\nThe mayor said he was set to meet with Jacobson and place him on administrative leave when the chief instead submitted his paperwork to retire, effective Monday.\n\nElicker said it’s unclear how much and for how long Jacobson had been taking money from the informants' account and that it doesn't appear others were involved. He said city officials are cooperating with state investigators looking into the matter.\n\nElicker said he has tapped Assistant Police Chief David Zannelli, who was among the officers to confront Jacobson over the funds, to serve as interim chief.\n\nJacobson took office in July 2022, just weeks after a Black man was paralyzed in the back of a police van in an incident that roiled the police department and the city.\n\nFive officers were arrested in connection with the mistreatment of Richard “Randy” Cox, who suffered a neck injury and was left paralyzed from the chest down when the police van with no seat belts he was in braked hard to avoid an accident and sent him flying into a metal partition.\n\nJacobson recommended firing four of the officers, and the city’s police commissioners terminated them. The fifth officer retired before he could be disciplined. One of the fired officers won his job back after an appeal.\n\nJacobson had been with the department for 15 years before being named chief.

    "fullText": "No one does fast food quite like McDonald’s. After all, that signature smell of fresh french fries wafting through the car after a trip to the drive through is hard to compare to anything else. Whether you’re going for a burger, nuggets or even just a sip of their crispy Coke, you can’t really go wrong with the fast food giant—unless you’re ordering the McRib. In December, a lawsuit was filed against McDonald’s by four individuals who claim the restaurant has been lying to customers regarding the meat that makes up this menu item. Here, read all there is to know about the McDonald’s class-action lawsuit.\n\nWhen you hear the name “McRib,” it’s fair to assume that what you’re consuming is going to be rib meat—but according to the plaintiffs behind this lawsuit, McDonald’s has been deceiving its customers. “Despite its name and distinctive shape—its meat patty has been deliberately crafted to resemble a rack of pork ribs—the McRib does not contain any actual pork rib meat at all,” claims the lawsuit. “Instead, its meat patty is reconstructed using ground-up portions of lower-grade pork products such as inter alia, pork shoulder, heart, tripe and scalded stomach.”\n\nWhile the sandwich is called the McRib, the McDonald’s website doesn't explicitly say the menu item contains rib meat. Instead, among the ingredients listed for the McRib is a McRib Pork Patty, alongside McRib sauce, pickles and onions on a homestyle bun. “The McRib starts with seasoned boneless pork dipped in a tangy BBQ sauce, topped with slivered onions and tangy pickles, all served on a toasted homestyle bun,” states their website.\n\nThe individuals behind the lawsuit argue that including the word “rib” in the item’s name indicates that the sandwich consists of “at least some meaningful quantity of actual pork rib meat.”\n\nThe current McDonald’s class-action McRib lawsuit  is not the first lawsuit the fast food giant has dealt with, but they recently responded to the claims at hand. “This lawsuit distorts the facts and many of the claims are inaccurate,” they told NBC Chicago. \"Food quality and safety are at the heart of everything we do—that’s why we’re committed to using real, quality ingredients across our entire menu. Our fan-favorite McRib sandwich is made with 100% pork sourced from farmers and suppliers across the US. We’ve always been transparent about our ingredients so guests can make the right choice for them.”\n\nAt this point in time, the people behind the lawsuit are asking that those who have purchased a McRib within the last four years receive class certification and later, “compensatory damages, restitution, and injunctive relief.” Whether you're a McRib fan or not, staying informed about what's in your food helps you make the best choices for you and your family. And if you're craving that tangy BBQ flavor? Now you know exactly what you're getting.\n\nLooking for more trending stories?

Ro Khanna (D-CA) in his crusade to release the Epstein files.\n\nWeeks before U.S. forces invaded Venezuela and apprehended President Nicolas Maduro, Massie claimed Trump’s interest in the country was primarily about “oil and regime change.”\n\nIn response, Trump has consistently shaded Massie for his perceived betrayal of the Republican Party. On Christmas, the president called out Massie by name in a Truth Social post.\n\nDuring his remarks at a GOP retreat in Washington, D.C., Trump praised the efforts of Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) before continuing his attacks on Massie:\n\n“A lot of times they’ll say, ‘I wish Mike were tougher.’ He’s tough. He’s tough as anybody in the room, actually. But can’t be tough when you have a majority of three — and now, sadly, a little bit less than that. But, you can’t be Trump. You can’t, ‘I want you!’ You know, you make 10 enemies, 20 enemies. That’s the end of that, right?” mused Trump. “Everybody loves him. I would say there’s one person he’s given up on. He just gave up on this guy. He’s so bad. He never votes for us. No matter how good, he won’t vote for us. There’s a sickness there. There’s something wrong. You can have the greatest bill, the greatest for the country — forget about for Republicans — great, great, great for the country. ‘I’m a no vote.’ We don’t even bother calling him at three in the morning, do we?”\n\nThe post ‘There’s a Sickness There’: Trump Tells House Republicans ‘There’s Something Wrong’ With Their Colleague Thomas Massie first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Mammals aren’t known for the ocular regenerative powers, but a new study shows that nature has a few tricks up its sleeve.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this study:\n\nThe animal kingdom is full of examples of species that can fully regenerate their vision, but unfortunately, humans are not among them.\n\nA new study highlights that mammals aren’t without some nifty tricks—cells in the eyes of mice increased branching, or sprouting, to compensate for damaged cells.\n\nInterestingly, the study revealed that male mice recovered more quickly and completely after injury than female mice, which echoes how women typically experience symptoms of concussion for longer than men.\n\nBillions of people globally experience some kind of vision impairment, with many millions living with near or total blindness. With such an astounding number of people functionally lacking our most primary sense for navigating through the world, scientists have eagerly pursued methods to restore human vision. But while other members of the animal kingdom display remarkable methods of vision regeneration, mammals largely lack these restorative powers.\n\nHowever, we might not be completely without biological advantages, and scientists hope that understanding the ways our body does restore some level of vision after injury could lead to therapies for vision-based maladies.\n\nWithin the human body, it’s mostly seen as a given that neurons do not regenerate once damage. But this didn’t explain how people appeared to regain some ability, including vision, after a traumatic injury. To investigate, scientists from Johns Hopkins University in Maryland explored what happens between connections of cells in the visual system and neurons in the brain in mice after an injury. While neurons didn’t regrow, the researchers did notice that surviving cells increased branching, allowing for more connections in the brain. Eventually, this branching process—known as “sprouting”—resulted in nearly the same number of connections as before the injury. The results of this study were published in the journal JNeurosci.\n\n“The central nervous system is characterized by its limited regenerative potential, yet striking examples of functional recovery after injury in animal models and humans highlight its capacity for repair,” the authors wrote. “Here we […] explore, for the first time, the evolution of structural and functional changes in the terminal fields of the injured visual system.”\n\nWhile the mice in the study did recover to an extent, the scientists were surprised to see that recovery wasn’t uniform across sexes. Male mice showed enhanced recuperative abilities, while female mice experienced slower and incomplete repair by comparison. While an unexplained discovery, the phenomenon isn’t wholly unexpected.\n\n“Women experience more lingering symptoms from concussion or brain injury than men,” Johns Hopkins University’s Athanasios Alexandris, the lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “Understanding the mechanism behind the branch sprouting we observed—and what delays or prevents this mechanism in females—could eventually point toward strategies to promote recovery from traumatic or other forms of neural injury.”\n\nWhile the mammalian body offers effective strategies for restoring vision, scientists are looking across the entire animal kingdom for methods of ocular regeneration. In August of 2025, scientists reported on the inner genetic workings of the apple snail’s eye-restoring abilities, and a few months prior, another team achieved partial vision restoration in mice by leveraging the evolutionary strategies of zebrafish.\n\nFor now, humans lack methods for fully regenerating cells that can completely restore our much-needed vision. But scientists are eagerly hunting for clues to unlock this biological secret—whether in far-flung phylums or within our own bodies.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

It's similar to investing in early-stage biotechs, where there are some promising results, but nothing indicative of true future success. Couple that with how many companies are competing for quantum computing dominance, and it turns into a very difficult area to invest in.\n\nFurthermore, this industry has a lot of hype around it, and some of the pure-play stocks, like IonQ and Rigetti Computing, are seeing their stocks rapidly rise and fall in line with the risk tolerance of the market.\n\nMany investors may want to shy away from this industry because of the volatility and lack of a clear leader, which is fine. However, I think there's a smarter way to invest in the quantum computing realm without needing to expose yourself to high-risk investment that has a huge chance of paying off.\n\nHow? Through an investment in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).\n\nAlphabet is a large conglomerate of companies, but it's mainly centered around the Google ecosystem. While Google Search and the ad revenue it generates are the core of Alphabet's business, it's more diversified than that segment.\n\nAlphabet also owns a cloud computing business, Google Cloud. Google Cloud uses computing units from other providers, such as Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), to rent out computing capacity to customers for a wide variety of tasks. However, it has to purchase those GPUs from Nvidia, which is expensive.\n\nGoogle also developed the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) in-house in collaboration with Broadcom, which is a step closer to fully building its own computing hardware. However, Alphabet has chosen to develop its quantum computing hardware entirely on its own, which could pay off big-time for its cloud computing business if it succeeds.\n\nIf Alphabet can win the race to build the first commercially viable quantum computer, then clients will flock to Google Cloud to utilize this cutting-edge technology. This would have other trickle-down effects, such as more clients using its generative artificial intelligence (AI) model, Gemini. Quantum computing technology is expected to greatly reduce the cost of running artificial intelligence training and inference, which would make Gemini the go-to model if Alphabet can develop a quantum computing advantage.",

    "description": "An expedition earlier this year to the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan retrieved two ice cores from a glacier that seems to be perplexingly increasing in size.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nAs climate change continues to alter the planet, one of the earliest casualties will be glaciers spread across the world.\n\nHowever, the Pamir mountains in Central Asia have long resisted the trend of decline, even adding mass in the past.\n\nIce cores retrieved from one of the glaciers in the region will hopefully tell us more about why these particular glaciers are so resistant to climate change, though recent studies suggest this long-held resiliency may be slipping.\n\nDisappearing glaciers across inhabited continents are one of the most startling indicators of anthropogenic climate change. A new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change estimates that we’re losing roughly 1,000 glaciers a year, a number that’s likely to increase as we reach mid-century. With each glacier lost, with it goes vulnerable ecosystems, sources of freshwater, tourist dollars, and even a sense of the spiritual.\n\nWhile this steady disappearance of glaciers is an overwhelming global trend, there is at least one part of the world where, for decades, this inevitable deglaciation appeared to be in reverse. The Kon-Chukurbashi high-altitude ice cap in the Pamir Mountains (also known as the “Roof of the World”), located primarily in the central Asian country of Tajikistan, rests at 5,810 meters, or about 19,000 feet. While the rest of the world’s glaciers melted into oblivion, this ice cap actually grew in size, and scientists want to understand this unexpected resilience.\n\nEarlier this year, an international team of scientists traveled to the ice cap to secure two ice core samples measuring at least 100 meters in length. The first core traveled to an underground sanctuary in Antarctica called the Ice Memory Foundation, a safeguarded repository of climate information for centuries to come. The other core traveled to the Institute of Low Temperature Science at Hokkaido University in Sapporo where Yoshinori Iizuka, a professor at the university, will analyze the sample in an attempt to understand this particular ice cap’s anomaly.\n\n“If we could learn the mechanism behind the increased volume of ice there, then we may be able to apply that to all the other glaciers around the world,” Iizuka told AFP. “That may be too ambitious a statement. But I hope our study will ultimately help people.”\n\nThis mission originally planned to extract samples from the famous Vanch-Yakh Glacier, previously known as the Fedchenko Glacier, which was the longest glacier that survived outside of the world’s polar regions, but the mission proved too difficult for helicopters to access the area. However, the Kon-Chukurbashi is by no means second-rate, as the untold layers of compacted dust will tell scientists up to 30,000 years of information regarding past atmospheric conditions, snowfall, and temperature for one of the least-studied mountain ranges in the world.\n\n“We pulled up the last core of ice, which was spectacular,” Evan Miles, a glaciologist at the Swiss universities of Fribourg and Zurich who was part of the expedition, told AFP in another article. “Really yellow ice, because it has so much sediment inside of it. Which is a really good sign for us.”\n\nSadly, whatever data can be derived from the samples may come too late for many glaciers, including the Pamir region itself. Earlier this year, a study led by scientists at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria revealed that recent snowfall decrease in the Pamir region is undermining its storied resiliency, even stating that “whichever way we analyzed the model, we saw an important tipping point in 2018 at the latest” in reference to the Kyzylsu Glacier, another glacier in the Pamir Mountains.\n\nIt turns out even the world’s last refuge for glaciers can’t withstand the rapid warming driven by anthropogenic climate change.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

This warning is not written by a disgruntled employee.\"\n\n\"Come to find out, the insurance company was not properly reviewing charts because oftentimes, prescriptions weren't filled because the medication had been changed. Or the cost of the med or co-pay was too high. So, we were berated for things outside our control or because they couldn’t be bothered to look at the full picture. The insurance company then offered incentives (aka, bribes) to persuade the patients to fill these discontinued prescriptions or tests they didn’t want. My colleague, who owned the clinic, asked them how far they wanted us to go. Did they want us to pay for their prescriptions? Drive to their homes and shove the pills down their throats? Remove them from their homes and drive them kicking and screaming to the lab, radiology place, or surgicenter? I have never been prouder to work with him. Of course, the insurance company didn’t like that at all and said we were being unreasonable.When I left for the day, I called my husband to discuss borrowing money from my parents to pay for my tail coverage (around $22K), which is essentially a buyout of your malpractice coverage that continues to insure you for a specified amount of time once you stop practicing. I was so worried he’d think less of me for wanting to quit medicine. I’d spent so many years where I’d worked so hard under awful conditions to get where I was. Was it a waste? Nope. He was so supportive. Just wanted me to be happy. Wanted me to be able to sleep at night without sleeping pills. For my terrible work-related anxiety to get better. My family was the same way. My stepdad didn’t even let me finish my story before he asked how much money I’d need to quit. I’m so lucky to have that kind of help. After a few months, I got a university teaching job, quit medicine, and have never looked back. I miss some patients, but nothing else.\"\n\n\"On top of that, they would insult us and call us racist names. I reported them to my school, and I was the one who paid. I wasn't accepted into any residency, and as a result, I was unable to practice medicine. I now work at a tech company and make twice what I would have made as a family doctor, working decent hours from the comfort of my own home.\"\n\n\"Also, we are not trying to 'run up your bill' with treatments and medications. We have no idea what the hospital will charge you. We don't even know what kind of insurance you have or if you have insurance at all, unless they call us to deny something.\n\nThe new rules that came out a few years ago mean patients can see their test results before the doctor does. The point is good — it's intended for patients to access their records. But imagine logging into your healthcare portal to find out that your MRI detected cancer that you didn't even know about, and your doctor hasn't had a chance to come in and talk to you about it yet. Many people don't understand the wording in their test results, and they don't know what a lot of the lab values mean. So, it makes them very anxious, or they go straight to Google and read about worst-case scenarios. In the past, doctors would review the results first and then release them for patient review.\n\nLastly, Google is a great resource, but that's just it. It's a resource. It doesn't replace the education and experience of your medical staff. People will literally argue with us because they googled things and insist that we are wrong. We spend all day trying to help people. It doesn't benefit us to give you false information. Consider trusting the people who work in healthcare for a living.\"\n\n\"Insurance companies are a different market profiting beast that has more healthcare power decision-making than they should be allowed to have. I've seen so many patients, as well as family members, get denied for life-saving medications prescribed by a doctor with adequate evidence for proof of medical necessity.

    "fullText": "The post Think Bees Just Sting? The Shocking Truth About Hive Intruders appeared first on A-Z Animals.\n\nManaging 80,000 insects requires a lethal response to specific mammalian threats.\n\nThe weight of a single mouse prevents caretaker bees from executing disposal tasks.\n\nHive sterility relies on the counter-intuitive preservation of organic decay.\n\nThe winter cluster is necessary for protection even though it leaves the entrance unguarded.\n\nMice love to take shelter inside beehives. It’s a perfect spot for a mouse; warm and cozy with plenty of honey to eat. However, bees aren’t too keen on invaders, and they have ways of dealing with wasps, robber bees from other colonies, or even an errant mouse that’s wandered into their home.\n\nHoneybees (Apis mellifera) are highly social insects that often live in colonies ranging from about 10,000 to 80,000 bees. Each bee has its role to play, and there are three main types of bees: the queen, the worker, and the drone. The queen’s job is to lay eggs. The drones are male honeybees, and their only function is to mate with the queen. Most of the bees are worker bees, and each worker bee has a job to do. Workers build the hive and honeycombs, care for the queen and her larvae, forage for pollen, and guard the hive.\n\nBees are highly aware of intruders entering their hive. The smell of honey is enticing to many creatures, from the tiniest ant to a large bear. Guard bees protect the entrance of the hive from wasps, robber bees from other colonies, other insects, and mammals.\n\nThe bees’ main defense is their stinger, but they also have other ways of warding off intruders. When a bee stings an intruder, its stinger remains behind, rupturing the bee’s abdomen and causing a fatal injury. However, bees have other means of protecting the hive. Sometimes, bees form a “bee ball” where they swarm an insect, smothering it until it can no longer breathe. A swarm of bees circling a creature can also raise the body temperature of the intruder to lethal levels.\n\nWhen bees kill an insect in the hive, caretaker bees, whose job it is to remove the dead from the hive, will carry the insect’s body out. This keeps the hive free from bacteria and parasites, and also helps them avoid other predators drawn to the smell of the decaying body. But what can bees do when the dead body is too large for the caretaker bees to remove? Let’s explore the fascinating way bees handle mice in their hive.\n\nMice can squeeze into the tiniest of places, and they are attracted to beehives by the smell of honey. When a nest of honeybees discovers a mouse inside their beehive, the bees swarm the mouse. They will either sting the mouse repeatedly until it dies or ball up around it, smothering the mouse to death. Once the rodent has died, the body is too heavy for worker bees to lift and carry out of their home. But leaving a body to decay in the beehive could result in other animals and insects being attracted to the hive by the odor. Decay can also introduce disease to the colony.\n\nThe bees don’t leave the mouse to rot; instead, they mummify its body. Bees produce a substance called propolis that they make from resins collected from a variety of trees and plants, including poplars, conifers, and other sources. Propolis, also known as bee glue, has antibacterial, antifungal, and preservative properties. Bees use it to line the hive’s inner walls, protecting themselves from pathogens.\n\nIn addition to building, bees use propolis to cover a dead mouse, applying it layer by layer over the body. When the layering is complete, the mouse’s body is enclosed in the substance and is essentially mummified. Now, the dead mouse will be largely preserved and protected from rapid decay, allowing it to remain in the hive without causing significant problems.\n\nIt’s not just bees that use propolis. Humans have been collecting and using propolis from the bees for centuries for its wound-healing attributes. Today, evidence suggests that propolis has anti-inflammatory properties, and people use it to treat various maladies such as cold sores, wounds, and fungal infections.\n\nFor bees to stay healthy and safe, they need to notice intruders as soon as possible. Typically, guard bees can detect an intruder right away by using chemical cues, such as pheromones. However, there is a time during winter when honeybees form a cluster around their queen to keep warm. The bees alternate shivering their wings to generate warmth. The group stays together in one part of the hive, eating honey in a cluster. Unfortunately, this leaves portions of the hive empty and unguarded.\n\nIf a mouse or several mice find their way inside the hive during this time, it’s possible they will go undetected. Just like in your home, mice can do a lot of damage inside a beehive in a short amount of time. Mice will eat honey and bee larvae, and they also cause physical damage to the hive. They tear out space to make their own nest and eat the honeycomb. Beekeepers will often install mouse guards or other protections to keep their hives safe from rodent damage during the winter.\n\nThe post Think Bees Just Sting? The Shocking Truth About Hive Intruders appeared first on A-Z Animals.",

    "description": "Nationwide protests continue to grow as rights groups accuse authorities of cracking down on demonstrators",
    "fullText": "Iranian security forces have clashed with protesters staging a sit-in at Tehran’s grand bazaar, firing teargas and expelling demonstrators as the nationwide protest movement continued to grow in its 10th day.\n\nThe violence on Tuesday at a location that carries historical symbolism as an activist hub during the country’s 1979 revolution comes as rights groups accuse authorities of cracking down on protesters.\n\nAt least 35 people have been killed in clashes surrounding the protests – which began over the state of the economy and rising prices – and more than 1,200 others arrested by security forces, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists news agency (HRNA).\n\nIn one instance, in Illam province, south-west of Tehran, video showed security forces in riot gear streaming into a hospital in search of protesters.\n\nDespite the violence, protests showed no signs of slowing, with demonstrations in at least 257 locations in 88 cities across the country, according to HRNA data. \n\n Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, told protesters on Tuesday that much of the economic situation was out of the government’s hands, warning that any intervention may only worsen already spiralling inflation.\n\n“The government basically does not have such power. Even if it wants to do this, it will be forced to put heavy pressure on the lower deciles of society by printing money. The country’s income is certain and our resources aren’t unlimited,” Pezeshkian said in a speech on Tuesday.\n\nThe dwindling purchasing power that first triggered the protests has continued to decline, with the Iranian rial dropping to a historic low of 1.46m to the US dollar. The currency has lost about two-thirds of its value in the past three years and its nosedive has accelerated in recent months.\n\nIran’s central bank has meanwhile said as the currency falls that it would curb a programme to businesses that gives a preferential exchange rate on dollars – a move that is likely to lead to further price increases and shortages for consumers.\n\nAn end to subsidised exchange could further exacerbate shortages in Iranian grocery stores. Iran’s state news agency said the average price of a bottle of cooking oil had recently doubled in price, while other goods are simply unavailable as traders hoard products in anticipation of further inflation.\n\nPezeshian said the government may have to tighten its belt, blaming worsening economic conditions on sanctions, saying “oil is under embargo and sources of income are limited”.\n\nThe president said the government would open an investigation into allegations of security forces’ violence against protesters in Illam province. He also mentioned “an incident in a hospital in the city of Illam”, referencing the footage of officers raiding a hospital there.\n\nThe videos were directly referenced by the US state department, which said that “beating medical staff and attacking the wounded with teargas and ammunition is a clear crime against humanity”, in a post on X from its Farsi-language account.\n\nThe Iranian government has been toeing a careful line between an all-out crackdown on protesters and appearing lax, offering dialogue while security forces carried out arrests and at times appeared to use violence against demonstrators.\n\nThe supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Saturday that the demands of protesters were legitimate, but that rioters among the demonstrators should be “put in their place”. The state-aligned Fars news agency said 250 police officers and 45 members of the volunteer paramilitary Basij force were injured in the demonstrations.\n\nDonald Trump has threatened to intervene in Iran if the government kills protesters, a comment that drew angry warnings from top Iranian officials. The US threat carried extra weight after the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, was captured and brought to New York by US forces on Saturday.",

    "description": "Spinach is cheap, versatile and backed by research. Studies link it to heart health, digestion and eye health — plus easy ways to eat more.",
    "fullText": "We are all aware of the numerous health benefits of vegetables. However, some can be a bit of a hassle to prepare and cook. One that’s seriously good for you and ridiculously easy to add to meals is spinach.\n\nAvailable in almost every supermarket and costing just £1.15 for a 250g bag, the leafy green is packed with nutrients that researchers have linked to heart health, digestion, energy levels and even eye health.\n\nA big part of its appeal is its versatility. Spinach can be eaten raw or cooked, wilted, blended or sautéed, making it ideal for adding to everything from omelettes to pasta sauces, salads, curries and even green juices.\n\nSpinach is low in calories but rich in vitamins and minerals. A small serving contains vitamin A, vitamin K, potassium, magnesium and fibre – nutrients that support everything from bones to digestion.\n\nIt also contains antioxidants that can help protect cells from damage caused by everyday wear and tear in the body.\n\nBecause spinach contains fibre, it can also help support digestion and gut health by keeping things moving and feeding beneficial gut bacteria.\n\nOne area researchers have focused on in particular is the potential impact of spinach on blood pressure.\n\nSpinach contains natural compounds called nitrates. When eaten, the body turns them into nitric oxide, a substance that helps blood vessels relax and widen, allowing blood to flow more easily.\n\nResearch suggests this process can lead to small but meaningful reductions in blood pressure and support healthy blood vessel function. Studies examining diets rich in nitrate-containing vegetables have also found a link to lower resting blood pressure over time.\n\nSpinach also provides potassium, a mineral that can help balance sodium levels in the body – another important factor in maintaining healthy blood pressure.\n\nEye health: Spinach contains antioxidants that may help protect the eyes and are linked to a lower risk of age-related vision problems.\n\nBone health: It also contains vitamin K, which plays a role in bone strength and helps the body use calcium properly.\n\nImmune support: Vitamin C in spinach supports immune function and helps the body repair tissues.\n\nHere’s how you can easily add more spinach to everyday meals:\n\nBlend into a green juice with apple, cucumber, mint and lemon\n\nStir a handful into scrambled eggs or an omelette\n\nAdd to a breakfast wrap with eggs and mushrooms\n\nUse spinach instead of lettuce in sandwiches, salads or wraps\n\nStir into soup or ramen just before serving so it gently wilts\n\nToss into a grain salad with quinoa, chickpeas and lemon\n\nStir into pasta sauces or curries at the last minute\n\nServe wilted spinach alongside fish, chicken or tofu\n\nBlend into a quick spinach pesto with garlic, olive oil and nuts\n\nFrozen spinach also works well in cooked dishes like soups, curries and pasta sauces, and is a budget-friendly option that lasts a bit longer, too.\n\nFor most people, spinach is a safe and nutritious food to incorporate into a balanced diet. However, there are a couple of situations where it’s worth being mindful.\n\nSpinach is high in oxalates, so people with a history of oxalate kidney stones may be advised to limit how much they eat, rather than avoiding it completely.\n\nAs it’s also rich in vitamin K, this could affect how some blood-thinning medications work. If you take medication such as warfarin, it’s best to consult your GP before making any significant changes to your spinach intake.\n\n4 superfood soups to batch cook now (Yahoo Life UK, 3-min read)\n\nThe cheap superfood fruit you're almost certainly not buying (Yahoo Life UK, 4-min read)\n\nThe 80p superfood with 4 key health benefits (Yahoo Life UK, 4-min read)",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — There are few signs that President Donald Trump’s supporters wanted the United States to become more embroiled in foreign conflicts ahead of its military actions in Venezuela — even as many Republicans show initial support for his military strike there, according to an Associated Press analysis of recent polling.\n\nMost Americans wanted the U.S. government to focus in 2026 on domestic issues, such as health care and high costs, rather than foreign policy issues, an AP-NORC poll conducted last month found. Meanwhile, polling conducted in the immediate aftermath of the military operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro suggested that many Americans are unconvinced that the U.S. should step in to take control of the country.\n\nAnd despite Trump’s suggestion that the U.S. may take a more expansive role in the Western Hemisphere, Republicans in polling last fall remained broadly opposed to the U.S. getting more involved in other countries’ problems.\n\nThere’s still room for public opinion to shift as Trump's administration clarifies its next steps for Venezuela. But it could be a challenging issue for the Republican president, particularly given Americans’ desire for the government to fix economic issues at home.\n\nForeign policy and drug trade weren’t high priorities for many Americans\n\nHeading into the new year, Americans were less likely to want the government to focus on foreign policy than they had been in recent years.\n\nAbout one-quarter of U.S. adults listed foreign policy topics — such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel or general involvement overseas — as something they wanted the government to prioritize in 2026, according to an open-ended AP-NORC question that asked respondents to share up to five issues they wanted the government to work on in the coming year. That was down from the prior two years, when roughly one-third of Americans considered foreign issues an important focus. Almost no one specifically named Venezuela.\n\nMaduro pleaded not guilty to federal drug trafficking charges on Monday in New York. His capture followed U.S. strikes on boats that the Trump administration said were carrying drugs from Venezuela to the U.S. Despite the Trump administration’s focus on the issue of drug trafficking, it doesn’t register at the top of Americans' lists of issues for the government to focus on. Few Americans mentioned drug-related issues as a priority, and it was primarily a Republican issue. About 1 in 10 Republicans mentioned it, compared with hardly any Democrats or independents.\n\nInstead, Americans overall were more focused on domestic issues — including health care, economic worries and cost-of-living concerns — as top priorities for the government.\n\nMore Americans say the US should not run Venezuela\n\nAmericans are split about the U.S. capturing Maduro — with many still forming opinions — according to a poll conducted by The Washington Post and SSRS using text messages over the weekend. About 4 in 10 approved of the U.S. military being sent to capture Maduro, while roughly the same share were opposed. About 2 in 10 were unsure. Republicans broadly approved of the action, while Democrats were largely opposed to it.\n\nNearly half of Americans, 45%, were opposed to the U.S. taking control of Venezuela and choosing a new government for the country. About 9 in 10 Americans said that the Venezuelan people should be the ones to decide the future leadership of their country.\n\nIn December, a Quinnipiac poll found that about 6 in 10 registered voters opposed U.S. military action in Venezuela. Republicans were more divided: About half were in support, while about one-third were opposed and 15% didn’t have an opinion.\n\nFew Republicans wanted the US more involved in the world’s problems\n\nOnly about 1 in 10 Republicans wanted the U.S. to take a “more active role” role in solving the world’s problems, according to an AP-NORC poll from September. They were much less likely than Americans overall, or Democrats and independents, to say the U.S. should become more involved. Most Republicans, 55%, said the current U.S. role in global issues was “about right.”\n\nIt could be a tricky position for a president who ran on a promise of putting “America first” and ending the country’s involvement in “forever wars.” About 7 in 10 voters who backed Trump in the 2024 presidential election said that they wanted the U.S. to take a “less active” role in solving the world’s problems, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of interviews with registered voters in all 50 states.\n\nBut at least in that poll, which was conducted before the military operation that removed Maduro, Trump's supporters still were largely behind him: About 1 in 10 Americans who voted for Trump in 2024 felt he had deserted the “America First” promise, while the overwhelming majority felt he had kept it.",

    "description": "Measles cases are popping up around the country. Doctors share what to do after a measles exposure and what to do to stay safe.",
    "fullText": "Measles cases are spreading across the country.\n\nDoctors share what to do if you’ve been exposed to the virus.\n\nPlus, what infectious disease doctors want you to know about the disease.\n\nPublic health officials in New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Colorado have recently sent out warnings of travelers infected with measles passing through busy airports and other areas. Couple that with measles’ ability to spread rapidly, and it’s understandable to have concerns about the disease.\n\n“Measles is extraordinarily infectious—if you’re susceptible,” says Thomas Russo, M.D., a professor and chief of infectious diseases at the University at Buffalo in New York.\n\nEach year, a small number of measles cases pop up in select areas around the country. But the past 12 months have been different. Nearly 2,100 people across 44 states were impacted by measles in 2025, according to data shared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That’s the highest number of cases in 25 years. Unfortunately, cases continue to surface.\n\nMeet the experts: John Sellick, D.O., an infectious disease expert and professor of medicine at the State University of New York at Buffalo; Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., an infectious disease expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security; Thomas Russo, M.D., a professor and chief of infectious diseases at the University at Buffalo in New York.\n\nThese warnings about exposures keep coming, making it fair to wonder what this means for you. Here, infectious disease doctors break down some of the most pressing questions people have about measles, plus what to do if you are exposed.\n\nWhile there are outbreaks across the country each year, most people aren’t overly familiar with measles. Also known as rubeola, measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus, according to the CDC. It may cause symptoms like a cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and spots inside the mouth.\n\nBut measles may also cause serious health complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation in the brain), per the CDC.\n\nMeasles is considered one of the most contagious diseases in the world, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The virus can stay active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to two hours. The WHO also notes that one person who is infected with measles may infect up to 18 other people.\n\nThe virus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes, Dr. Russo explains. From there, people breathe in infectious particles or touch surfaces that those particles land on and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth, which may lead to infection.\n\nThe infectious period with measles is long—people who are infected may spread the virus to others four days before they develop the classic measles rash and four days after it appears, per the WHO.\n\nHow can I prevent getting measles?\n\nThere is a vaccine to prevent measles, called the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. It’s part of the childhood vaccination series and is given in two doses. One dose is 93% effective at preventing measles, while two doses is 97% effective, per the CDC. (Despite new changes to the CDC's childhood vaccination schedule, the MMR vaccine is still recommended for all children.)\n\nThe first dose is usually given between 12 and 15 months, and the second dose is given between ages four and six, or whenever children start school, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). It’s still possible to get the MMR vaccine as an adult or beyond that age range, but the doses need to be spread out by 28 days, per the AAP.\n\nThe MMR vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine, which means that it contains a weakened form of the measles virus, explains John Sellick, D.O., an infectious disease expert and professor of medicine at the State University of New York at Buffalo. That trains the immune system to react if you’re exposed to measles down the road.\n\n“The vaccine is not perfect, but it’s really pretty good,” Dr. Russo says.\n\n(Just be aware that people born between 1963 and 1967 received a measles vaccine during childhood that isn’t considered effective, according to the CDC. If this describes you, the CDC recommends getting vaccinated again.)\n\nUltimately, you can get measles if you’re fully vaccinated, but it’s unlikely. (Again, the vaccine is 97% effective, so three out of 100 vaccinated people may get it.) “There were a few individuals who received a shot in the most recent measles outbreak and got infected,” Dr. Russo says. “But if you have some protection, you’re less likely to get severe disease as well.”\n\nIf you discover that you crossed paths with someone who has measles, don’t panic. If you were born before 1957, doctors consider you to have “presumptive immunity,” which means that you were likely exposed to the virus as a child and therefore should have immunity to it, Dr. Russo says. “If you have presumptive immunity or if you’ve been vaccinated, you don’t have to worry about a measles exposure,” he says.\n\nAmesh A. Adalja, M.D., an infectious disease expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, agrees. “There is no action to take,” he says.\n\nIf you were born after 1957 and you haven’t been vaccinated or are partially vaccinated, you still have options. While there is no treatment for measles, you can get vaccinated after an exposure or receive an injection of antibodies called immune serum globulin to help provide protection against severe disease, Dr. Adalja says. (The immune serum globulin treatment is the only option for pregnant women, infants, and people who are immunocompromised because the vaccine is a live virus and not recommended for those groups, Dr. Russo explains.)\n\nBut if you know you’ve been exposed and you’re not sure if you have immunity, “the safest thing is to get vaccinated,” Dr. Russo says. Dr. Sellick agrees. “It’s safe to get another dose, even if you were fully vaccinated or already immune to the virus,” he says.\n\nIf you develop symptoms of measles, call your doctor (don’t go into the office—you’ll risk exposing others). Again, there is no treatment for measles, but your doctor may suggest immune serum globulin and supportive care, like acetaminophen for fever and plenty of fluids, along with monitoring yourself for serious complications of the virus. Ultimately, it’s best to contact a healthcare provider. They can provide the next steps from there.\n\nCan Apple Cider Vinegar Lead to Weight Loss?\n\nBobbi Brown Shares Her Top Face-Transforming Makeup Tips for Women Over 50",

    "fullText": "CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil called out \"big problems\" on the air during his first live show.\n\nThe network appeared to edit out a technical mishap for the episode's streaming debut.\n\nDokoupil recently shared a public plea for viewers to hold him to high standards of journalism at the head of the show.\n\nTony Dokoupil's CBS Evening News debut is off to a rocky start, as an on-air flub that saw the anchor call out \"big problems\" during Monday's live broadcast was edited out of the episode's subsequent streaming premiere.\n\nIn clips reposted on social media and media outlets of the live show, Dokoupil pauses to address what appears to be an issue with text on his teleprompter, as he segues from reporting on the recent capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro to another topic involving Sen. Mark Kelly.\n\n\"To other news now, to Gov. Walz. No, we're going to do Mark Kelly,\" Dokoupil says in the clips, pausing to correct the issue. \"First day! First day, big problems here.\"\n\nHe continues, asking, \"Uh, are we going to Kelly here? Or are we going to go to [fellow journalist] Jonah Kaplan?\" ahead of a few seconds of silence during the telecast. Dokoupil then recovers, advising the crew that \"we're doing Mark Kelly, possibly demoted form his retired rank of captain in the Navy.\"\n\nAt around 14 minutes into the episode's subsequent upload to CBS' website, however, the moment unfolds differently. After the topic on rising gas prices and the potential global impact of Maduro's ouster, Dokoupil moves on to discuss Secretary Pete Hegseth and Sen. Kelly without issue.\n\n\"All right, now to another one of today's top stories: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is moving to have Sen. Mark Kelly possibly demoted from his retired rank of captain in the Navy,\" Dokoupil says, uninterrupted as he relays the news.\n\nEntertainment Weekly has reached out to a representative for the CBS News division for comment.\n\nThe development comes days after Dokoupil's New Year's Day address to viewers to hold him and the legendary CBS program (previously fronted by Walter Cronkite, Katie Couric, and more) to high journalism standards as he prepared to take over the CBS Evening News desk.\n\nThe former CBS Mornings personality, who was named Evening News anchor last month following polarizing journalistic figure Bari Weiss' controversial takeover of CBS News, said that \"I have felt like what I was seeing and hearing on the news didn't reflect what I was seeing and hearing in my own life,\" and used that information to make a vow to his audience that he would prioritize them during his tenure.\n\n\"So, here's my promise to you, today and every time you see me in this chair: you come first,\" Dokoupil stressed in the video message. \"Not advertisers. Not politicians. Not corporate interests. And, yes, that does include the corporate owners of CBS. I report for you.\"\n\nGet your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.\n\nHe clarified, explaining that \"I tell you what I know, when I know it, and how I know it.

It also means I'm going to talk to everybody, and hold everyone in public life to the very same standard.\"\n\nCBS Evening News airs weeknights on CBS.",

    "fullText": "Jan 6 (Reuters) - One of the first police officers on the scene of the 2022 attack at a Texas elementary school that killed 19 students and two ​teachers is now the first to stand trial, accused of failing to act ‌as the gunman continued one of the deadliest mass killings targeting students in U.S. history.\n\nOpening arguments were to begin ‌Tuesday in the trial of Adrian Gonzales, 52, who was a member of the school district police force. Hundreds of officers from local, state and federal agencies waited 77 minutes before entering a classroom where the gunman was holed up. Teachers and children made lengthy calls to 911 emergency ⁠services, saying they were in the ‌room with the gunman and surrounded by bodies.\n\nGonzales was charged in 2024 with 29 counts of child endangerment, according to his indictment, which said ‍that he \"failed to engage, distract, and delay the shooter\" and that he also failed \"to follow his active shooter training to respond to gun fire by advancing toward the gun fire.\"\n\nEach count carries the possibility of ​two years in prison. Gonzales has pleaded not guilty. Gonzales' attorney, Nico LaHood, has said ‌that his client showed up to help children, and that he did in fact help many evacuate.\n\nPedro \"Pete\" Arredondo, the former chief of the Uvalde schools police and the person who investigators say was the officer in charge of the scene, faces 10 counts of the same charge. His trial has not yet been scheduled.\n\nState and federal investigations into the shooting found that officers ⁠left the 18-year-old gunman alone inside the classroom with ​children while weighing how to confront him.\n\nDebates between proponents ⁠of gun control measures and defenders of the constitutional right to bear arms have resulted in few restrictions on firearms in the United States compared to other industrialized ⁠nations.\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, in remarks made while presenting the federal report on Uvalde in 2024, said ‌that \"lives would have been saved\" had the police immediately confronted the gunman.",

    "fullText": "The conveniences of modern life such as Uber Eats and ChatGPT are robbing us of satisfaction – and worse still, infantilising us. But should we really go back to the basics?\n\nAppearance: A lifetime of happy inconvenience.\n\nIs this another example of something that already exists, but people think is new because someone rebranded it? Yes, obviously it is that.\n\nGreat! Let’s all save time by you telling me what it used to be called. Happy to oblige. It used to be called “character-building”.\n\nGot it. So friction-maxxing means doing hard things that will ultimately make you a better person? That’s exactly it, although “friction-maxxing” is cooler because it sounds vaguely futuristic.\n\nHow did the term come about? Via a piece in The Cut called “In 2026, we are friction-maxxing” in which writer Kathryn Jezer-Morton advocates for avoiding things that make your life more convenient.\n\nLike penicillin? No, obviously not penicillin. But things such as ChatGPT, location sharing and Uber Eats, which help you achieve things that historically took significant amounts of time and effort. Jezer-Morton argues that this culture of slick convenience only serves to infantilise us.\n\nBut it’s so easy. Yes, and that robs us of our sense of satisfaction. So you just used AI to write a school essay. Congratulations, you have achieved nothing of worth.\n\nWhereas if you friction-maxx? Then you’ve searched inside yourself. You’ve nudged your own personal boundaries, and discovered that you are more capable than you ever knew. You are building a foundation of perseverance and resilience that you cannot get from typing a prompt into a chatbot.\n\nI love this! What else does Jezer-Morton advocate? She also suggests sending your children on small errands (adding the friction of knowing they’ll do a bad job) and inviting people to your house without cleaning it properly (so you can enjoy the sweet friction of being judged).\n\nWhat the hell? That’s weird. No, it’s friction-maxxing, although admittedly at a higher level than I would be comfortable with.\n\nAnyway, hooray for banishing convenient things. Let’s ban automatic gearboxes while we’re at it! No, there’s no need for that.\n\nDishwashers? Refrigerators? No, both of those are probably fine as well.\n\nMechanised agriculture? The printing press? I see what you’re getting at. You’re saying we live in a world that is already filled with thousands of inventions which have, for hundreds of years, improved the lives of millions of people through increased convenience, and therefore it does seem slightly arbitrary to choose this exact moment in time to draw a line in the sand. You’re saying we should only use friction-maxxing when it comes to things that we didn’t grow up with.\n\nNo, I’m saying that I really hate mechanised agriculture. Oh, fine then. That’s probably allowed.\n\nDo say: “I hope a book comes out about friction-maxxing.”\n\nDon’t say: “I don’t want to read it, but I’m sure ChatGPT could turn it into some really great bullet points.”",

    "fullText": "Our reviewer sheds some light on adding brightness to your mornings with the best dawn simulation alarms, from Lumie and Philips to Hatch\n\nThe best sleep aids recommended by experts: from blue light-blockers to apps to help you nap\n\nTo wake each day in darkness is a plight you wouldn’t wish on your worst enemy, yet that’s what many of us do routinely throughout winter. Getting up in the dark decouples our life from our circadian rhythm (our body clock), with bodily processes such as cognition and metabolism put to work before they’re fully prepped.\n\nThank heavens, then, for sunrise alarm clocks. These “dawn simulation” devices glow with gradually intensifying brightness as your wake-up time approaches, kickstarting your circadian rhythm before you get out of bed. For many users, this results in a happier, healthier start to the day.\n\nNot all sunrise alarm clocks are made equal – for instance, only some are bright enough to be medically certified as light-therapy devices for Sad (seasonal affective disorder) and other disorders. We’ve indicated the two alarms that have this certification in their specs below.\n\nI awoke with 10 of the best-rated wake-up lights from Lumie, Beurer, Philips, Dreamegg, Momcozy, Blueair and Lexon to find out which would make the most difference to my mornings. As a lifelong reluctant riser, I’ve found the experience of testing these devices a gamechanger – in fact, I’m now using one daily. Perhaps mornings aren’t so bad, after all …\n\nBest sunrise alarm clock overall:\nLumie Bodyclock Glow 150\n\nBest budget sunrise alarm:\nMomcozy Sunrise Echo\n\nBest sunrise alarm clock for heavy sleepers:\nLumie Bodyclock Spark 100\n\nBest sunrise alarm clock for late-night reading:\n\n Philips SmartSleep\n\nBest mini sunrise alarm clock:\nLexon Mina Sunrise\n\nBest sunrise alarm clock for a gentle awakening:\nLumie Sunrise Alarm\n\nBest sunrise alarm clock for couples:\n\n Beurer Wake-Up Light WL50\n\nMornings, eh? I’ve often felt lousy first thing, after waking up to a minutes-long medley of smartphone alarms.\n\nWhen, at last, I drag myself out of bed, I frequently spend the day reviewing all kinds of gadgets, from Sad lamps to electric heaters. It’s a freelance job I’ve been privileged to do since 2017 – and as we tumbled dimly into 2025, the Filter gave me one of my most quietly life-improving assignments yet: reviewing sunrise alarm clocks. I tested three additional models in winter 2025/26, and one of these has emerged as my favourite of all.\n\nThe extent to which these gadgets have improved my mornings has surprised me – although it was greater in some cases than others. Frankly, I’d like other groggy wakers to feel the same benefit, and my reviews are written and ranked with this in mind.\n\nSome brands did not want the sunrise alarm clocks I sourced for testing back, so those will be donated for fundraising to Cat Action Trust 1977, a small national charity dedicated to the welfare of feral cats.\n\nThe only proper way to test a sunrise alarm clock is by using it to wake up each morning – so that’s exactly what I did.\n\nI used each model for at least two nights, testing out multiple light and alarm sound settings, and assessing the quality of wake-up for each device. I considered the brightness of each alarm, how close the glow felt to real sunlight, and the audio quality. Above all, I reflected on how lively and refreshed I felt after waking up with each one.\n\nMany sunrise alarm clocks also have a sundown function, so I used this where available too. I also tried using each sunrise alarm clock as a reading light, to help me finish the day – as well as start it – smartphone-free.\n\nSome sunrise alarm clocks go even further, with additional features such as app operability, multiple alarm profiles and mood lighting. To ensure a thorough review of each sunrise alarm clock, I played around with every possible customisation option and functionality.\n\nLumie is the brand that pioneered consumer-grade sunrise alarm clocks in the early 1990s, and that pedigree still shines through.\n\nEquipped with a comprehensive set of wake-up sounds and medical-grade sunrise simulation, the Bodyclock Glow 150 is the best sunrise alarm clock of the many I’ve tested. It comes at a premium price, but could pay dividends for your sleep cycle.\n\nWhy we love it\nThe sunrise effect is among the most convincing I’ve experienced, rivalling the less fully featured (but slightly cheaper) Lumie Bodyclock Spark 100, which is reviewed below. It feels like waking to daylight, or emerging into a clearing after walking through dense woodland.\n\nI found this model easy to control and configure via the five buttons surrounding the digital display. All of the personalisations that really matter are available, including sunrise light intensity and duration.\n\nCrucially, there’s a great selection of alarm tones to choose between – not always the case with Lumie models – ranging from the wonderfully gentle to the brusquely rousing. I preferred “tropical birds” and “waves” to “beep” or “steam train”, although I enjoyed imagining a train enthusiast waking contentedly to the latter.\n\nIt’s a shame that … there’s only one colour available: black (with a white lamp). This will suit some bedroom design schemes better than others.\n\nCertification: UK MDR 2002 and EU MDR 2017/745 medical classification\nModes: sunrise alarm, sunset, bedside light\nFootprint: W19 x D12cm\nFeatures: light-sensitive auto-dimming display\nBrightness settings: five\nSunrise duration: 20, 30 or 45 minutes\n\nThe clue’s in the name: the Momcozy Sunrise Echo comes primed with a selection of wake-up sounds intended specifically for mums, dads and their little ones. It’s also tough to topple, soft around the edges and weighs just 0.55kg.\n\nWhy we love it\nI’m neither a parent nor a baby, but I can certainly hear the soothing quality in the Sunrise Echo’s 30-strong repertoire of wake-up sounds, which includes lullabies alongside the usual nature sounds and meditative drones. The sound quality is impressive, with plenty of mid-range frequencies and a touch of bass. It’s nicely balanced and not at all jarring.\n\nThe Sunrise Echo creates a lilting light effect, rather than intensively light-therapising the sleeper as some higher-powered models do. It was easy to set up and customise the alarm using the well-labelled control buttons around the shoulder of the alarm clock. It was a little harder though, through a fug of sleepiness, to adjust the screen and light brightness via their respective dials on the rear of the device. Nonetheless, the Momcozy Sunrise Echo is an excellent, accessible option for users who don’t want a very bright wake-up.\n\nIt’s a shame that … a few nice-to-have features are absent, including FM radio and multiple alarms.\n\nCertification: none\nModes: sunrise alarm, bedside light\nFootprint: W19 x D8.5cm \nFeatures: night light (seven colours), sleep aid sounds, digital clock display, adjustable sunrise duration\nBrightness settings: 30\nSunrise duration: 30 minutes\n\nI woke up feeling great when I used the medical-grade Lumie Bodyclock Spark 100, which bathes the room in gradually intensifying, sun-like light for a set period before the alarm goes off.\n\nWhy we love it\nThe device is supposed to realistically imitate the lightening shades of a sunrise – and it does so more convincingly than any other brand’s sunrise alarm clock. Depending on your chosen light intensity setting, it can get very bright.\n\nThe Spark 100 also has a sunset feature that graduates through the same red, orange and white light colours used with the sunrise function, but in reverse order. After the sunset cycle, the light can either switch off entirely or remain in a gentle night-light mode, whichever you choose.\n\nBesides performing brilliantly as a wake-up light and sunset simulator, the Spark 100 is simply a nicely designed, well-made thing. I appreciated its soft-edged yet robust construction and handy features such as the cable organisation in the base. It’s a pleasure to have on the bedside table.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the alarm tone sounds piercing at the higher three of its five volume levels. I found myself settling for a 2/5 – though very heavy sleepers may prefer (or even relish) the louder options.\n\nCertification: UK MDR 2002 and EU MDR 2017/745 medical classification\nModes: sunrise, sunset, bedside light\nFootprint: W19 x D12cm\nFeatures: tap to snooze, auto-dimming display, adjustable sunrise/sunset duration, adjustable digital display brightness\nBrightness settings: five\nSunrise duration: 30 minutes\n\nThis lamp soon felt like part of the furniture on my bedside table. In typical Philips fashion, it’s a good-quality, dependable product, with a middle-of-the-road design that won’t look out of place in many bedrooms.\n\nWhy we love it\nSetup is incredibly slick – I was able to set my alarm time, sound and brightness by following the simple prompts on the device’s display, without having to consult the manual. Subsequently tweaking your alarm(s) takes a bit of practice, but you’ll master all the controls you need after a few days.\n\nThe SmartSleep’s wake-up capabilities are impressive, combining brilliant light with a diverse choice of alarm sounds. It also has FM radio and 3.5mm auxiliary audio input options for the user who has tired of Alpine and gong bath soundscapes. There’s a 5V USB charging outlet at the rear of the lamp, too, which could free up a valuable bedside power socket.\n\nI loved using this model as a reading light, as well as a sunrise alarm. Even when a bright setting is selected, the light seems relatively mellow and restful, which helped me get to sleep after reading pulpy detective novels late at night. The light can be deactivated with a press.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it costs such a lot. The SmartSleep has a hefty price to match its impressive performance.\n\nCertification: none\nModes: sunrise alarm, sleep mode with sunset simulation, bedside light\nFootprint: W22 x D12cm\nFeatures: FM radio, Aux audio input, “RelaxBreathe” breathing exercises, adjustable sunrise duration, snooze, up to two wake-up profiles (with separate alarms)\nBrightness settings: 25\nSunrise duration: 20, 25, 30, 35 or 40 minutes\n\nMy only general gripe with sunrise alarm clocks is that many of them are an aesthetic downgrade on a conventional bedside lamp – but this charming mini model from French brand Lexon is a stylish exception.\n\nWhy we love it\nThe obvious draw here is the design, which comprises a cute, mushroom-shaped light and colourful metal base with a wraparound digital display. It fits very neatly on to a small or well-utilised bedside table.\n\nThe sunrise light function roused me gently before the alarm tone (also gently rousing) sounded, and I got up feeling alert. Even though this isn’t a very bright light, it evidently did the trick, and it was suitable for bedtime reading, too.\n\nDepending on the model, you can choose from nine or five alarm tones, all of which sound pleasantly full and rich. These include birdsong and water sounds, as well as some loud, piercing alarms that will suit particularly heavy sleepers.\n\nBeautifully finished and stoutly made, the Mina Sunrise is a cut above the rest in terms of build quality.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the control buttons are on the base, and can’t be seen in the dark without a secondary light source such as a smartphone torch. You’d struggle to adjust the settings in the middle of the night.\n\nCertification: none\nModes: sunrise alarm, sunset, bedside light\nFootprint: W11 x D11cm\nFeatures: mood lighting (nine colours), snooze, cordless operation \nBrightness settings: five\nSunrise duration: 30 minutes\n\nImagine telling one of your ancestors that you were awoken this morning by your lamp, which was purring at you. I’m not pulling your leg, you might say, it’s all thanks to the Lumie Sunrise Alarm’s “kittens purring” alarm tone, which sits sweetly alongside four other natural sounds, including goats bleating and birdsong.\n\nWhy we love it\nIn all seriousness, this is an excellent sunrise alarm clock, and it comes at a standout price. Its sunrise light subtly brightens during the minutes leading up to your chosen alarm time, producing a lovely awakening that really did remind me of natural light.\n\nI found it easy enough to set the Sunrise Alarm’s time and alarm, although pressing some of the buttons can be fiddly. Do keep the instruction manual handy, as there are lots of options and buttons to get your head around.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it lacks a little bedside table appeal. But having said that, this sunrise alarm clock has incredible performance for the price.\n\nCertification: none\nModes: sunrise alarm, sunset, bedside light\nFootprint: W17 x D9cm\nFeatures: mood lighting (six colours)\nBrightness settings: 10\nSunrise duration: 30 minutes\n\nThanks to its capability to save two alarms for different times (each with its own sound and light settings), the Beurer WL50 is a great choice for couples who get up at different times. That’s a rare feature in any sunrise alarm clock – let alone in such a reasonably priced model.\n\nWhy we love it\nThe sunrise mode itself is gentle yet effective, and it’s easy to activate the device as a reading light with a simple, groggy tap. I really liked the alarm sounds you get with the WL50 too – which is just as well, as there are only two options.\n\nPerhaps that narrow choice of alarm tones sounds a little stingy, but it seems less so when you explore the WL50’s alternative audio options. It doubles up as an FM radio, with space to save up to 30 station presets, which you can listen to throughout the day or use as a livelier alternative to an alarm tone. Bluetooth connectivity and an AUX input expand your listening options further.\n\nCuriously, this sunrise alarm clock can be unplugged (when fully charged) and used on the go for up to three hours. It’s hard to imagine a situation wherein this would be useful, but I appreciate the gesture.\n\nIt’s a shame that … the sound quality isn’t great (but it’s good enough for the half-awake).\n\nCertification: none\nModes: sunrise alarm, sunset simulation, bedside light, radio/speaker\nFootprint: W11 x D11cm\n\n Features: FM radio, AUX audio input, Bluetooth audio, portable use (up to three hours), LED mood light\nBrightness settings: adjustable\nSunrise duration: 10, 20 or 30 minutes\n\nBest for: an air-purifying sunrise alarm clock\n\nMost of us spend around a third of our time in bed, so a sunrise alarm clock that also purifies your bedroom air seems like a good idea. This model, the Blueair Mini Restful, is heralded as the world’s first.\n\nThe sunrise function proved effective, waking me reliably with warm, increasingly bright light before the alarm sounded. As for the purification, the Mini Restful certainly made my air feel fresher after a windowsill-sanding session had kicked up untold volumes of dust. The fan works exceptionally quietly, although I still preferred to run it only during the daytime (this can be automated via the Blueair app’s schedule feature).\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … the sunrise alarm feature is only accessible via the Blueair app, and I feel that users should have the option to activate it manually. With that said, the app is a pleasure to use.\n\nCertification: none; modes: night light, sunrise alarm; footprint: W17 x D17cm; features: air purification, app control, alarm schedule; brightness settings: scale of 0-100%; sunrise duration: 15-30 minutes\n\nBest for: soothing sleep sounds\n\nThis compact, great-looking device offers something different, with a selection of 29 ambient sounds that can be used as white noise to help you fall asleep. There are also five options for rousing you in the morning, including birdsong, a campfire crackling and, my favourite, waves breaking on a shore. For me, perhaps the only issue with this approach was that the sounds did a better job of putting me to sleep than they did of waking me up.\n\nThe Sunrise 1 is a beautifully designed alarm clock, with a softly textured front and foolproof dimmer controls on either side to adjust the light level and digital display brightness. Reluctant risers will be pleased to note there’s a prominent snooze button at the top of the device – though, personally, I’ve rarely felt the need to use this feature while testing sunrise alarm clocks.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … its light is a little too dim for my taste.\n\nCertification: none; modes: sunrise alarm, white noise/sleep sounds, bedside light; footprint: W15 x D7.3cm; features: sleep sound timer, nine light colours, five wake-up sounds; brightness settings: adjustable; sunrise duration: 5 to 60 minutes\n\nBest for: customisation and smartphone connectivity\n\nIn some respects, this premium sunrise alarm clock has an edge over its competitors. It’s a chic, simple device, with a nicely textured front (similar to that of the Dreamegg Sunrise 1) and two unmissable buttons to activate sleep sounds or wake-up mode.\n\nWhile the Restore 2 has a pleasant, moderately bright light in a nice range of colours, its sound library is the real standout here. Some of the options – all of which are configurable with the Hatch Sleep smartphone app – are beautifully textured and more lifelike than anything I heard from competing products.\n\nThe same Hatch Sleep app gives you access to additional audio content such as relaxing meditations and inspirational moments – but only if you’re willing to shell out £4.99 a month for a Hatch+ subscription. You’ll also need to buy a US-to-UK plug adaptor to use with this sunrise alarm.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … the upfront cost of the product and ongoing subscription for paywalled content are off-putting.\n\nCertification: none; modes: sunrise alarm, white noise/sleep sounds; footprint: W18.4 x D6.2cm; features: paywalled content (including meditations and inspirational monologues), smartphone operability and sleep/alarm routine creation; brightness: adjustable in-app; sunrise duration: 5 to 60 minutes\n\nSad bright-light therapy involves the use of very intense light (in the region of 10,000 lux) to mimic the effects of bright sunlight. Sunrise alarm clocks tend to be far less bright than the average Sad lamp. With that said, the effect of light on our circadian rhythms has been shown to peak around the onset of dawn and early in the morning – so a mellow sunrise alarm may provide disproportionate benefits.\n\nIf you’ve been diagnosed with seasonal affective disorder and are looking for a light therapy device, it’s best to ask your GP which product to use and how to get the most benefit. Sunrise alarm clocks that are classified as medical devices (indicated below each product above) are more likely to suit users seeking a therapeutic effect than models with no medical certifications.\n\nGetting up in the dark can feel awful, which makes a lot of sense because our bodies require light to wake up properly.\n\nHumans are diurnal, which means we’ve evolved to be more wakeful, energetic and capable of chasing mammoths over vast distances during daytime. When the brain recognises increasing light at dawn, it sends signals around other regions of the brain and to other organs to calibrate bodily processes including temperature regulation, hormone secretion and metabolism. And when darkness falls, the brain prepares us for sleep – a helpful effect that many of us compromise by looking at bright smartphone or laptop screens.\n\nThese effects, which repeat every 24 hours, are our circadian rhythms. That is derived from the Latin words circa (approximately) and diem (day), meaning around a day.\n\nSo, the sun is the original and best alarm clock – activating our minds and bodies with light, rather than startling us awake with sound. Think of your sunrise alarm as a plucky stand-in to rely upon during the star’s shorter winter shifts.\n\nIn the market for some new bed linen?

    "description": "Elie...",
    "fullText": "Where is the international outrage over the US assault on Venezuela and kidnapping of Maduro?\n\nThe United States of America is a rogue nation, run by a violent criminal who operates outside the rule of law. The bombing of Venezuela and kidnapping of its president, Nicolás Maduro, so that he can stand for a show trial in New York, is a flagrant violation of international law. It is proof positive that the United States, under Trump, is the biggest “bad guy” on the international stage and should be treated accordingly. It’s a new low point in the era of lows we call the Trump administration. And it’s a return to the imperialist posturing and interventionism that has defined this country’s garbage treatment of Latin America for two centuries.\n\nThe United States should be condemned by the international community and all peoples of this earth. Decent countries should sanction us economically, and our leaders should be charged as war criminals and have their assets frozen. These sanctions should not just be directed at the top level of our government but also against our feckless Congress and the complicit politicians in both parties who support our illegal actions. The US should be treated like the global pariah it is, and that includes bringing all of the soft-power and shame the world can bring to bear on us: Our embassies should be closed and our diplomats expelled, our games and tournaments boycotted, including the upcoming World Cup and Summer Olympics. And everybody else should be issuing travel advisories to the US in an attempt to crash our tourism industry. Everything the international community did to Russia after it invaded Ukraine should be done to us now that we’ve invaded Venezuela and are trying to install a sham government there.\n\nJust like Russia, we have violated the UN charter with this unlawful use of force against a sovereign nation. Those rules can be broken only in cases of self-defense, but it should be pretty clear there that the United States has no legitimate self-defense case. Venezuela did not attack us, or our allies. Drug trafficking, no matter how you construe it, is not an “armed attack.” It is not a justification for the use of military force against a sovereign nation. Nobody who takes drugs in the United States is forced to do so at Venezuelan gunpoint. There is no line that can be drawn from a Trump supporter taking a bump at Mar-a-Lago back to a declaration of war on Caracas. The drug-trafficking-as-armed-attack line simply doesn’t work—not as a justification for bombing fishing boats in international waters in the Caribbean, and not for invading a foreign country and kidnapping its president.\n\nThe argument that the abduction of Maduro was a simple “law enforcement” action is also legally ridiculous. The United States has no jurisdiction over Venezuela, even though the Supreme Court has said that it retains jurisdiction over foreign nationals charged with crimes in the United States. Vice President JD Vance said: “You don’t get to avoid justice for drug trafficking in the United States because you live in a palace in Caracas.” Vance only went to Yale Law School, so maybe he didn’t learn this, but that is pretty much how it’s supposed to work: You don’t get to kidnap people living outside your country just because you want to bring them to trial. The only legal way to bring Maduro over the United States to stand trial would be with an extradition treaty between the US and Venezuela, which we do not currently have. And even if we did have some kind of mutual assistance agreement with Venezuela, Maduro should enjoy criminal immunity as a leader of a sovereign state (a concept Trump, the convicted felon, should understand well). Fundamentally, sending in our own military to make the arrest on foreign soil without the consent of the other country would still violate international law and the sovereignty of Venezuela.\n\nJust to close the loop on this ridiculous “law enforcement” argument, at his illegal arraignment in New York on Monday, Maduro (and his court appointed lawyer) revealed that he did not know his rights before the US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein informed him during the hearing. The arrest of Maduro fails “normal law enforcement” 101.\n\nMAGA sycophants have pointed to the arrest and trial of Gen. Manuel Noriega of Panama as precedent for this illegal action. In 1989, the US invaded Panama and eventually abducted Noriega, then forced him to stand trial in Miami where he was convicted of drug trafficking.\n\nFirst of all, citing some risibly illegal shit we did 35-odd years ago to justify some risibly illegal shit we’re doing now is not a “legal argument” so much as proof that illegal activity will be repeated if it is unpunished. We had no right to invade Panama in 1989, just as we have no right to invade Venezuela now. We do these things because we are a nuclear superpower that treats all Latin American countries as our misbehaving colonies, not because we have moral, ethical, or legal ground to stand on.\n\nThat said, even the Panama invasion had more of a veneer of legality than the Venezuelan one. For one thing, Noriega’s government had technically declared a state of “war” against the United States, and an attack had left a few unarmed American soldiers dead. That’s not a lot of legal justification for George H.W. Bush to abduct a foreign ruler, but it was a lot more than what Trump has now.\n\nDespite that thin lacquer of legality, the United Nations condemned US actions in Panama.\n\nHopefully, they’ll condemn our actions again, but (newsflash to Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jefferies) we’re going to need more than a strongly worded letter from bureaucrats. Speaking of Schumer, Jeffries, and the cadre of feckless Democrats, they seem very bent out of shape that Trump didn’t go to Congress to ask for a declaration of war before kidnapping a foreign ruler. But let’s be clear: having congressional authorization to violate the peace of the world does not make those violations “more legal.” As I said: The entire international community should rise up against us.\n\nThey won’t. Already the leaders of Europe are stammering out platitudes meant to avoid Trump’s wrath. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that he “regarded Maduro as an illegitimate president and we shed no tears about the end of his regime.” French President Emmanuel Macron initially said that Venezuelans “can only rejoice” at the ouster of Maduro, evidently ignoring Venezuelans’ feelings about the bombing of their capital by a foreign power. Later, he walked it back somewhat and said he “neither supported nor approved” of Maduro’s abduction. Good to know that kidnapping is still generally frowned upon by the French government. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz made the most Weimar Republic statement possible: He said the legality of the US operation was “complex” and that “international law in general” should be followed. “In general” is doing a lot of work here.\n\nI cannot be surprised that many of the leaders of the traditional European powers are willing to let the United States play colonial master over a Latin American country. Europe hasn’t had the strength or the will to seriously oppose US policy in Latin America since 1812, and starting an economic war with us over yet another example of US imperialism is not something the European imperialists are likely to do.\n\nI also can’t be surprised that many of the non-white and wanna-be white countries whose economic interests align with the United States have also offered support of yet another American attempt at regime change in Latin America. From Japan to India to the American puppet government in Argentina, standing against the US is evidently too expensive.\n\nThese countries should oppose us, but imperialists generally stick together. The world will still come to participate in our reindeer games, and the United States will spend a whole year congratulating itself over the 250th anniversary of our Declaration of white male Independence without even pausing to consider the irony that independence for white people here has meant two and a half centuries of subjugation for everyone else we share the hemisphere with.\n\nI’d be remiss if I didn’t point out that this is why no leader in the Global South should respect the United States or the white international community at any level. US leaders have proven time and again that they are racist hypocrites who do not stand for freedom or liberty, only the rape and pillage of resources their countries don’t have enough of. Whether those resources are oil, wealth, or even human beings, it doesn’t matter: The white world sticks together when it comes to stealing stuff from non-white countries.\n\nBooks & the Arts\n\n /\n\n Nick Juravich\n\nThe US is a rogue state, but it is a rogue white state menacing its non-white neighbors, and that’s always OK. Even non-white countries understand that. Everybody on the global stage knows that the rules are different when white nations take what they want, particularly when they’re taking it from non-white nations. They’ve been doing it for literal centuries.\n\nIn this way, Trump’s actions against Venezuela are far from unprecedented. Violent, illegal actions by this country against sovereign Latin American states are the norm. Trump, as is his want, is just doing the normal thing without the usual white niceties that come with imperialist machinations.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump staged an illegal coup. Chuck Schumer’s response? Empty words and meaningless parliamentary maneuvers.\n\nIn a colossal show of both imperial hubris and reality-TV-grade carelessness, America’s ruling regime has kidnapped a world leader and his wife and ordered them to go to trial on overblown charges of “narcoterrorism” (together with menacing-sounding but ultimately vacuous offenses such as being in possession of machine guns, which much of the MAGA movement regards as a sacred duty). Efforts to justify the action veer wildly from gangster-style resource extraction to the assertion of a new brand of hemispheric hegemony, while supposed plans to “run the country” on a puppet-colonial basis are plainly nonexistent. (Fittingly enough, the administration’s newly designated point-person in the arrangement is reportedly the racist thug who’s overseen a vastly unpopular and counterproductive federal siege of terror over US cities the administration doesn’t like.) In a symbolic flourish that says everything, the real proximate cause of the illegal coup appears to be the deposed leader’s habit of posting videos of himself dancing to troll America’s fathomlessly petty and dance-challenged maximum leader.\n\nAll of this would present a series of prime targets for a robust and engaged opposition party—particularly since one effective (if also bogus) plank of the MAGA movement’s mass appeal has been its professed allergy to America’s “forever wars” and the myopic military actions that provoked them. If only we had such a party. Instead, we have the Democratic Party. And what are the Democrats doing to call out the rapaciousness and the self-dealing hypocrisy of the Republican ruling caste? So far, as little as possible.\n\nThe central complaint from Democratic leaders has been that the Trump White House didn’t properly consult Congress in advance of its crime spree. And even that grievance rings hollow. Thus far, Democrats have shown no inclination to pursue an impeachment resolution against the president—the clear constitutional remedy for such abuses—even as a growing chorus of lawmakers are calling for it, together with leaders of the party’s activist base.\n\nIt’s safe to assume that party leaders will continue to brush aside calls for impeachment and other measures of accountability for the Trump regime’s brigandry—that is, after all, exactly what happened when Trump conducted his illegal bombing attack on Iran last summer. And the Democratic caucus failed to get traction behind a pair of earlier resolutions to curb the administration’s lawless military adventurism against Venezuela, even as a handful of dissident Republicans backed them.\n\nThe sorry record of party leaders on Trump’s brazen defiance of the Constitution’s war powers provisions reinforces the major liability that afflicts Democrats ahead of a critical midterm cycle: that they simply aren’t serious about making good on their many rhetorical denunciations of the Trumpified GOP’s lurch into cultlike authoritarian rule.\n\nSadly, the party’s inert approach to illegitimate acts of war well predates Trump’s Venezuela rampage; leading Democrats sat on their hands while their own president backed a genocidal war in Gaza—a lockstep posture of complicity so deeply ingrained that the Democratic National Committee refused to let any Palestinian speaker take the stage at the party’s 2024 convention. Democrats likewise enthusiastically hailed Barack Obama’s raid in Pakistan to kidnap and execute Osama bin Laden with little thought that it would serve as a precedent for later imperial errands like Maduro’s ouster.\n\nSome of this self-inflicted myopia can be traced to one variant or another of “the Vietnam syndrome”—the dread of appearing out of step with bellicose public opinion during one of the country’s countless acts of imperial plunder masquerading as a national security crisis. That was the feeble lamentation from a trio of centrist House Democrats in a recent report in Axios, one of the party establishment’s favorite clearinghouses for anonymous left-bashing. One said that Democratic criticism of the MAGA putsch in Venezuela “looks weak…. If you don’t acknowledge when there is a win for our country, you lose all credibility.” Warming to the strains of such do-nothing centrist lullabies, another lawmaker said, “As Democrats, we can’t just condemn what happened.… I wish the Democratic Party would be a little bit more measured on this.” Still another misunderstood soul complained that “everything Trump touches must be bad according to the base.” It’s worth noting that none of these heroic dissenters spoke on the record—a weaselly maneuver that’s far weaker than principled opposition to an unlawful and unprovoked violation of another nation’s sovereignty.\n\nAt a time when the MAGA creed is poised to project itself wantonly across the Western Hemisphere, these maundering statements aren’t just self-serving bromides—they’re a plea to be spared the work of actually doing politics. As Democrats gear up to make the case that they should be granted control of Congress to stave off the power grabs, racist internment campaigns, and crimes of the second Trump White House, the last thing they should be doing is to bypass the essential task of drawing firm and principled distinctions between their own agenda and that of the thuggish opposition they have deemed an existential threat to American democracy. Yet that is precisely the reflex of the party’s leadership. It’s why virtually every statement on the Venezuela raid issued from the sanctums of Democratic power starts with the denunciation of Maduro as an illegitimate dictator—as though that makes an American-led kidnapping-and-coup campaign somehow more palatable. To make the case that even antidemocratic foreign leaders should be shielded from externally engineered coups is to mount a political argument—a vindication of basic guidelines of conduct for any self-professed republic. And making that argument means countenancing resistance, hazarding electoral risks, and refashioning your party’s organizing convictions on more coherent and legible lines.\n\nDemocratic leaders have demonstrated again and again that they can’t be bothered with any of that. Instead, they’re poised to treat the Venezuelan travesty as they have most of the other power grabs, crimes, and corrupt bargains of the Trump era—as something that can be safely left untended until it passively ripens into an opportunity to eke out a narrow clutch of wins in the next electoral cycle. In that spirit, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer took to the bully pulpit of Morning Joe on Monday to preach bipartisan backing for another war powers resolution to prevent further incursions into Venezuela without advance notification to Congress. Never mind that the Democrats failed to advance their past two such resolutions. And never mind that Schumer’s appeal to his GOP colleagues was flat-out hallucinatory: “If there was ever a time, [Republicans] must step up to the plate. This is the time. And if they don’t, they’re gonna feel the heat from their constituents.”\n\nIn other words: The opposition party that continually rules out impeachment as a viable strategy is banking on lawmakers aligned with a ruling party that’s systematically purged and primaried anti-MAGA dissidents from its ranks to rescue flailing Democratic bids to get illegal war plans duly set down on paper before the concerned principals on Capitol Hill. That’s the polar opposite of politics—and it is most decidedly weak.",

    "fullText": "Eddie Howe has affirmed his commitment to Newcastle United amid links with the vacant Man Utd job after Ruben Amorim was sacked.\n\nThe Portuguese tactician was let go by the Red Devils after hinting at trouble behind the scenes in his post-match press conference following Sunday’s draw with Leeds United at Elland Road.\n\n“I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the head coach,” he said. “I know my name is not Conte, Tuchel, Mourinho but I’m the manager of Manchester United.”\n\n“It’s going to be like this for 18 months or until the board decide to change. I’m not going to quit. I’ll do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.”\n\nHowe’s name has been linked with the Man Utd job in the past and he has emerged as a potential candidate for the position yet again. But the former Bournemouth boss says “nothing will change” while he is happy at St. James’ Park.\n\n“Nothing has changed from my perspective,” he told the media on Tuesday. “I’m 100 per cent here, working as hard as I can, head down, ignoring all the stuff you guys [media] write – good or bad – because it’s irrelevant.\n\n“It’s about today’s work and trying to prepare the team as best we can for Leeds. That will never change, from my perspective.\n\n“With my commitment to my work and my job, as long as I’m happy and able to express myself in the best way I can to help the team, nothing will change.”\n\nRead – Man Utd prepared to wait for right Amorim replacement\n\nAsked if anything could tempt him away from Newcastle, Howe replied: “No, not at this current time. As I said, the most important thing for me is happiness in the role, the relationships I have with the people around me.\n\n“That’s not always been consistently good and things can change at any football club, but at the moment, I’m very happy.\n\n“For any club to be successful, there has to be unity from top to bottom, there has to be a good feeling between everybody. I’ve had an unbelievable relationship with the board here since I’ve come to the football club and that’s never changed.\n\n“I consider myself very lucky to have that as I think there are very few managers that have the time to build those relationships and to have the confidence and trust within each other is really important. If you have all of those things, you have a higher chance of being successful.\n\n“I’m very happy at the moment, and hopefully that stays for a long time.”\n\nRead – The favourites to become next Manchester United manager\n\nSee Also – The football stories that defined the year in 2025\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube | TikTok",

    "description": "Zhou Guanyu says joining Cadillac as a reserve driver for 2026 feels like \"rejoining family\"",
    "fullText": "Zhou Guanyu has described his move to Cadillac F1 as a reserve driver in 2026 as \"rejoining family\", ruining with his former Sauber team-mate Valtteri Bottas and his long-time manager Graeme Lowdon.\n\nIt was confirmed on 5 January that the Chinese driver had signed with the American outfit for 2026 after a year-long stint in the same role at Ferrari in 2025. Zhou made his F1 debut in 2022 with Alfa Romeo/Sauber alongside Bottas, where he drove with the Finnish driver for three years.\n\n\"We spoke a lot,\" Zhou said about Bottas during an interview with F1.com. \"We spent a lot of time [together], even when we were in different teams over the course of last year, so the three years I spent [in F1 were] really together with Valtteri.\"\n\nZhou was thought to be in contention for a full-time seat at Cadillac, which is set for its debut in 2026 as F1's 11th team, due to his links with Lowdon. The team principal has been Zhou's manager for several years. But he was ultimately signed as a reserve driver while Bottas is set to drive alongside former Red Bull driver Sergio Perez.\n\n\"But at the same time I always worked together with Graeme, and that's really what brings me the high trust over this project. I haven't worked with Checo before – I know he's a great driver,\" Zhou added.\n\n\"But the three of us were always very honest people, and also we're very transparent with what's going on behind the scenes. So when you come into a massive chapter change over the rules, that's what you really need.\n\n\"You need a team that can drive forward all together, rather than just focusing on an individual side of the garage for the, let's say, single benefits and results. All that is really important.\n\n\"And as well, it’s a new team, so it just puts extra energy on it because you start from scratch. For me, it's also a brand-new experience I’ve never been [in] before. I’m excited for what's coming ahead, and looking forward to going back in the Charlotte factory, spend some simulator time, and also at Silverstone with all the engineers.\"\n\nCadillac will be using Ferrari power units from its debut until it becomes a works team, which it aims to do by 2029. This is another area where Zhou feels comfortable, having only ever raced in the championship with Ferrari power units.\n\n\"Since this new era of Formula 1 introduced in 2022, I was only driving with Ferrari engines, which I got really used to, and also while I was testing development for Ferrari last season, I was also trying their 2026 engines, so all these things come into play together,” he explained.\n\n\"I have a very precise idea and a feeling with feedback on how the engine, power unit, gearbox, everything works, and also the hydraulic system. When you change from engine to engine, that's also one of the biggest things you need to adapt as a driver, because the way you downshift, the way you drive, the driving style, it's going to be changing.\n\n\"You need to adapt, which, for me, I will be already up to date. I'm looking forward to seeing what is the biggest difference this year, because it's going to be a big change. Even though we are a Ferrari power unit, I think every single manufacturer is going to develop over the years, so that's going to be very important.\n\n\"I think this year is not about who can start on top; it's all about, throughout the season, who can put the most efficient hours in terms of wind tunnel development and to have the most efficient benefits on the aerodynamics or improvements throughout the season.\n\n\"So that's what I’m looking forward to, and also I don't feel that I'm joining somewhere where everything I need to adapt to. I have the people I worked with, the engine the same and also, like I've mentioned, many staff and engineers I worked with over the course of the years. Everything just feels already like I’m familiar with everyone.\"\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "The Athletic has live coverage of Bears vs. 49ers on NFL “Sunday Night Football.”\n\nGood morning! Keep your job today. Inside:\n\nEvery moment of the past two years has felt like an inflection point for women’s basketball in America. Viewership is surging. Will they capitalize?\n\nIt kind of defeats the entire definition of an inflection point, but if there really is one, the sport has arrived at its doorstep now. Consider:\n\nThe WNBA, after a spike in popularity, is undergoing a contentious negotiation for a new collective bargaining agreement. Salaries and revenue are set to explode. The question is just how the players and league will agree to share the boom.\n\nThe sport’s rise has manifested in other ways. As recently as a couple years ago, it was standard for WNBA players — afforded meager salaries compared to those in other pro sports — to travel overseas to make big money during the offseason.\n\nEnter new leagues like Unrivaled, which opened its second season last night, and Project B, a new venture that will launch in November. While there are differences — Unrivaled is a three-on-three sport, while Project B is more akin to the full game but with a wide travel schedule — they offer similar things: more money, and player equity in the league.\n\nUnrivaled started its sophomore year with four games last night, highlighted by the Mist, an expansion franchise, winning its first game, and Rose, the defending champions, winning by 20. My favorite bit about watching these games: The league uses a modified version of the Elam Ending, in which teams play three timed quarters, but the fourth quarter is untimed. The first team to reach a certain point total (11 points more than the leading team has after three quarters) wins.\n\nI asked Ben Pickman, who wrote an excellent preview of the Unrivaled year yesterday, about whether he thinks the league has a chance to make an imprint on the larger sports world this year:\n\n“Unrivaled already excels at creating social media content that puts WNBA players fully onto viewer radars during the winter. What will be interesting is how its viewership continues to grow and whether fans become more invested in the nightly results of its games. The league’s viewership on TNT and truTV in Year 1 was comparable to the NWSL’s viewership on ESPN networks this past season, and though it is far behind the WNBA’s viewership, the two leagues are of course at varying points in their history.”\n\nBen also made an interesting point to me: With the NBA off TNT, Paige Bueckers, who plays for the Breeze, is the second-most famous athlete broadcast by TNT Sports, behind only Shohei Ohtani.\n\nThese are exciting things. Let’s move on to something a little more dour:\n\nWe discussed the looming specter of “Black Monday” yesterday — the day most NFL coaches get fired. That part came to fruition. What we didn’t expect was the firings to extend beyond the American version of football.\n\nCleveland canned Kevin Stefanski after six years in charge, which saw two playoff appearances, a disastrous trade for Deshaun Watson and a sack record all achieved amid boggling highs and lows. Jason Lloyd writes that, despite those temporary highs, Stefanski leaves behind a lot of bad things.\n\nThe Cardinals fired Jonathan Gannon after three largely unsuccessful seasons. He finishes his tenure 15-36 with no playoff appearances. Tough timing after the team’s X account wished him a happy birthday Sunday.\n\nPete Carroll is officially one-and-done in Las Vegas, which feels like a sad line in what probably will be a Hall of Fame career (a convo for another day). General manager John Spytek, hired last offseason with Carroll, will remain in his role and help Tom Brady with the coaching search. What a weird year.\n\nWe’ll have to wait on movement for replacements, as plenty of those candidates are still coaching for playoff teams. One curious name to consider, though: Philip Rivers.\n\nNow, to the surprising news from across the ocean we briefly mentioned yesterday:\n\nManchester United is done with manager Ruben Amorim after a maddening 14-month tenure that began with lofty promise. Amorim’s critics viewed him as inflexible, though his tactics were successful elsewhere. Man Utd finished 15th in the Premier League table last season and sits sixth right now. One thing will be missed: Amorim’s bizarre news conferences.\n\nIn other soccer sacking news, Celtic parted with Wilfried Nancy after just 33 days in charge. He joined Dec. 3 after a stint with the Columbus Crew. His early dismissal set records.\n\nWoof. Let’s move on to some more … normal news.\n\nHawks, Young working on trade\n\nAtlanta and star guard Trae Young are discussing a possible trade, a source confirmed to The Athletic, which has been a long time coming on a few different levels. Young is still just 27 and in his prime, and still possesses the ability to be an elite scorer. But it’s very clear the Hawks are a better team without him this year, and he can enter free agency after the season. Read our full story here, which includes a potential suitor.\n\nMontana State wins wild FCS title game\n\nMontana State won its first FCS championship since 1984 last night, 35-34 over Illinois State, which had become the Cinderella of the FCS tournament bracket. The game itself was unhinged, and ended after the Bobcats converted a fourth-and-10 for a touchdown in overtime on a pass from quarterback Justin Lamson to Taco Dowler (sweet name). That was merely the caboose for what transpired in the minutes before. The full recap is worth a read.\n\nSweden outlasted Czechia to win its first World Juniors gold medal since 2012 yesterday. More details inside.\n\nIndiana and Alabama drew a record 23.9 million viewers for their Rose Bowl matchup. Yowza.\n\nDolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is open to a fresh start with a new team. Hm.\n\nColts cornerback Charvarius Ward Sr. said yesterday he is considering retirement after suffering three concussions this season. Read the 29-year-old’s full comments.\n\nTough flip: Notre Dame quarterback Kenny Minchey is heading to Kentucky, just hours after he committed to Nebraska.\n\nF1 driver Checo Pérez said being Max Verstappen’s teammate at Red Bull was the “worst job.” Yikes.\n\n📺 NCAAM: Duke at Louisville\n\n7 p.m. ET on ESPN\n\nThe Blue Devils are ranked No. 6 and have the star power, while the Cardinals are No. 20 and still favored in this game. Sounds like a good sell to me.\n\n📺 NHL: Panthers at Maple Leafs\n\n7:30 p.m. ET on TNT and HBO Max\n\nThe defending champions have steadied a bit after a tough start to the season, while Toronto remains moribund, which has been a slow-burn surprise. \n\n📺 NBA: Heat at Timberwolves\n\n8 p.m. ET on NBC and Peacock\n\nThe best NBA game of the evening is here, and it’s funny that the 23-13 Timberwolves are flying under the proverbial radar a bit. Still great with a Tier 1 scorer, but sitting sixth in the West and biding time until the playoffs. Don’t sleep on them, though.\n\nGet tickets to games like these here.\n\nWe had a scheduling mix-up last week, for which we apologize. Here is the excellent story we promised you then: Katie Whyatt’s look at how sex workers have increasingly used European soccer clubs as sort of a brand boost on social media. Read it here.\n\nNick Baumgardner has a new 2026 NFL mock draft with Oregon QB Dante Moore going No. 1 to Las Vegas. Moore might be deciding between being the No. 1 pick and staying in college.\n\nDan Duggan tore into Giants ownership yesterday for retaining general manager Joe Schoen, arguing the franchise has “no standards anymore.” Make time for this one.\n\nImportant table-setter: Ken Rosenthal and Will Sammon update us on where the Cubs, Yankees and Blue Jays stand as the MLB offseason withers away.\n\nMost-clicked in the newsletter yesterday: NFL playoff schedule.\n\nMost-read on the website yesterday: Our projections of every NFL playoff team’s odds to win the Super Bowl.\n\n📫 That’s all for now!

    "fullText": "Morecambe FC confirmed on Monday that Maldini Kacurri was returning to Arsenal following the end of his loan deal at the National League club.\n\n“A lot of ups and downs but enjoyed and learnt a lot during my time at Morecambe,” Kacurri wrote on Instagram. “Thank you to the fans, players, and coaching staff for welcoming me, I wish the best for everyone associated with the club going forwards.”\n\nKacurri had only signed on until January, so it was always Arsenal’s plan to see him return in the winter window, though there had been some suggestions Morecambe were keen to keep him.\n\nThe centre-back won Morecambe’s Player of the Month award in both October and November, and it seems he caught the attention of clubs further up the English football pyramid.\n\nJames McNicholas reports for The Athletic that non-league Morecambe were indeed in favour of extending Kacurri’s stay, but they face rival interest from clubs in the English Football League.\n\nAn extra complication is that Kacurri’s Arsenal contract expires at the end of the season, so the Gunners may now prefer to sell rather than loan him.\n\nBut McNicholas suggests a loan is also still on the table, so what happens next is going to depend on the offers that come in.\n\nKacurri made 18 appearances for Morecambe, scoring one goal and assisting one from his role in central defence. It was the 20-year-old’s second spell in senior football after playing a few games on loan with Bromley last season.\n\nThe youngster also made his senior international debut in a friendly match for Albania against Gibraltar in September, though he’s yet to appear in their squad for a competitive fixture.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea have confirmed the appointment of Liam Rosenior as their new head coach, handing the 41-year-old a long-term contract running until 2032.\n\nThe move brings an end to Chelsea’s search for a successor to Enzo Maresca, who was dismissed on New Year’s Day.\n\nRosenior arrives from RC Strasbourg, another club within the BlueCo ownership group, following months of internal assessment and dialogue.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Englishman publicly confirmed that he had verbally agreed to take the role, describing Chelsea as an opportunity he “could not turn down”.\n\nFormal confirmation followed shortly afterwards, with Chelsea outlining their belief in Rosenior’s ability to deliver immediate impact and long-term stability.\n\nThe appointment reflects the club’s continued preference for a head coach aligned with its multi-club model and development-focused strategy.\n\nRosenior will not be in the dugout for Wednesday’s Premier League trip to Fulham, with Under-21 coach Calum McFarlane remaining in interim charge.\n\nHe is expected to take his first training session on Thursday ahead of Saturday’s FA Cup third-round tie away at Charlton Athletic.\n\nChelsea officials believe the timing allows Rosenior to ease into the role while maintaining continuity during a congested fixture schedule.\n\nRosenior leaves Strasbourg after an 18-month spell that significantly raised his profile in European football.\n\nHe guided the Ligue 1 side to a seventh-place finish last season, securing European qualification for the first time in nearly two decades.\n\nThat achievement, combined with a clear tactical identity, accelerated internal discussions about his readiness for a higher-profile role.\n\nThe shared ownership structure between Chelsea and Strasbourg eased negotiations but also placed scrutiny on the decision-making process.\n\nRosenior acknowledged the emotional difficulty of leaving Strasbourg mid-season but stressed transparency with players, staff and supporters.\n\nHe will be joined at Stamford Bridge by trusted members of his backroom team, including Kalifa Cisse, Justin Walker and analyst Ben Warner.\n\nChelsea’s statement emphasised Rosenior’s capacity to build structured teams while demanding high standards both on and off the pitch.\n\nThere remains a clear expectation that results will improve quickly following a turbulent period for the club.\n\nRosenior’s managerial journey has been unconventional but steadily progressive.\n\nAfter retiring in 2018, he moved into coaching at Brighton & Hove Albion before gaining senior experience at Derby County and Hull City.\n\nHis work at Hull, where he narrowly missed the Championship play-offs, laid the groundwork for his move abroad.\n\nWith Chelsea still competing across multiple fronts, the immediate challenge is stabilising form and restoring clarity.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea have now officially announced their new permanent head coach, but it comes with a major shock attached to it.\n\nAs you will have heard, Liam Rosenior from Strasbourg was always the main candidate to get the role as new head coach at Chelsea. Even this morning, Fabrizio Romano was reporting that Chelsea were on the verge of announcing the Englishman as their new manager.\n\nBut the appointment comes with major concerns, with Jamie Carragher pretty much writing off the inexperienced manager from day one.\n\nAnd there are many Chelsea fans too who are concerned with hiring Rosenior, who has never managed in the Premier League and his biggest gig so far has been with Strasbourg.\n\nI think concerns and question marks are just natural. But the fact is now that they all just have to get used to it, because Chelsea have officially announced Rosenior as their new head coach on their website this morning.\n\nThe big shock is that Chelsea have given the former Hull City manager a very long contract, longer than many other managers would ever get at any club really.\n\nRosenior has signed a contract with the club that will take him through to 2032. That is some mad commitment there from the club.\n\nAs I’ll always do, I’ll get behind any Chelsea manager until they give me reason not to. Club over anything else. Chelsea FC comes first and is way more than staff, owners, players – who all come and go. All the very best of luck, Liam.",

    "fullText": "Head coach Eddie Howe says he is \"very happy\" at Newcastle United as he dismissed speculation linking with him the Manchester United job.\n\nOnly Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta and Fulham head coach Marco Silva have been in charge of a Premier League team longer than Howe since he was appointed by Newcastle in November 2021.\n\nAsked if anything could tempt him away from St James' Park, following Ruben Amorim's sacking at Manchester United on Monday, Howe said: \"No. Not at this current time.\n\n\"The most important thing for me is happiness in the role, happiness in the job, the relationships that I have with the people around me.\n\n\"That has not always been consistently good. Things can change at any football club, but I'm very happy at the moment.\"\n\nThere were tensions between Howe and sporting director Paul Mitchell, who left last summer after less than a year in the job.\n\nBut Howe has quickly struck up an understanding with Ross Wilson, who replaced Mitchell.\n\nWilson is the third sporting director Howe has worked with since taking charge, while David Hopkinson is the second chief executive after Darren Eales stood down because of ill health.\n\nHowe said he is content at Newcastle as long as he can \"express myself in the best way possible and be the best version of myself\".\n\nNewcastle are ninth in the Premier League - but only two points off fifth - have reached the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup and are on course for a last-16 play-off spot in the Champions League.\n\nHowe continues to enjoy the backing of the club's majority owners, the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, as well as minority shareholder Jamie Reuben.\n\n\"For any club to be successful, there has to be unity from top to bottom,\" Howe said. \"There has to be a good feeling between everyone.\n\n\"I've had an unbelievable relationship with the board. That's never changed.\n\n\"I consider myself very lucky to have that because there are very few managers that have the time to build those relationships.\n\n\"To have the confidence and trust within each other is really important. Hopefully that stays for a long time.\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "PDC Q-School 2026: Storied names survive the early skirmishes originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nFormer World Champion and all round darts legend Steve Beaton has safely navigated the opening minefield at the PDC's Q-School 2026, booking his passage to the final stage after storming into the last 16 on day one. The Bronzed Adonis, still chiselled, still unflustered, still very much alive in the fight, can now exhale. What lies ahead from Thursday onward will be infinitely more punishing – but for now, the popular veteran, who reversed a decision to step off the main tour in 2024, has earned a brief ceasefire.\n\nKeeping him company in the hotel lounge is former World Cup winner John Henderson. The experienced Scot has done exactly what was required, nothing more, nothing less. Job done. Feet up. A couple of days’ rest secured, safe in the knowledge that when the real party starts, it’s always more fun when Hendo is invited.\n\nTHE PDC Q-SCHOOL: How to win a Pro Tour golden ticket\n\nFourteen other hopefuls have joined them in this early sanctuary, all punching their tickets to the final phase with days to spare – a priceless luxury in a week where energy, nerve and sanity are finite resources. They are:\n\nLloyd Walker (ENG), James Howard Jones (ENG), Jamie Kelling (ENG), Damien Grimes (IRE), James Evans-Bradford (ENG), Daniel Ayres (ENG), Killian McCormack (IRE), Jake Eichen (ENG), Joe Croft (ENG), Joseph Heywood (ENG), Paul Lewis (ENG), Charlie Large (ENG), Keelan Kay (ENG) and Jamie Tiley (SCO).\n\nMeanwhile, across the Channel in Germany, the same pattern is emerging. Among the early qualifiers in Kalkar is Brian Raman, the 2022 WDF World Championship quarter-finalist and former PDC Tour Card holder, who will be eyeing a swift return to the professional circuit after falling away at the end of 2024.\n\nStanding alongside him is a name that once sent shockwaves through the elite – Jeffrey de Zwaan. The Black Cobra. Two-time Players Championship winner. Former World Matchplay semi-finalist. Those achievements may sit almost a decade in the rear-view mirror, but at just 29, time has not yet closed its fist. There is still venom left.\n\nCompleting the European batch who earned passage to the final stage on day one: Sietse Lap (NED), Jeffrey Keen (NED), Dennis Van Bergen (NED), Jarno Bottenberg (NED), Jose Justicia (ESP), Gilbert van der Meijden (NED), Michael Hurtz (GER), Michael Van De Ven (NED), Michael De Mayer (BEL), Tomislav Rosandic (CRO), Mitja Gustorf (GER), Kris Mievis (BEL), Jiri Brejcha (CZE) and Luitsen Elzinga (NED).\n\nFor the full stories and \n\nDarts World subscriptions options include Print, Digital and All Access packages, as well as exclusive products and competitions",

    "fullText": "Chelsea confirmed on Tuesday the little-known Liam Rosenior will be their new head coach on a six-and-a-half-year deal, replacing Enzo Maresca.\n\nThe 41-year-old Englishman told a press conference earlier in the day at Ligue 1 club Strasbourg he had \"verbally agreed\" on the move to Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe Premier League club announced Rosenior had signed a deal until 2032.\n\n\"I am extremely humbled and honoured to be appointed head coach of Chelsea Football Club,\" he said in a statement on Chelsea's website.\n\n\"This is a club with a unique spirit and a proud history of winning trophies.\n\n\"My job is to protect that identity and create a team that reflects these values in every game we play as we continue winning trophies.\"\n\nRosenior has just three years' experience as a manager, with Hull City and French club Strasbourg, and has never coached in the Premier League.\n\nBut he had been widely touted as the frontrunner to succeed Maresca since the Italian left Chelsea last week.\n\nStrasbourg are part of the Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital-owned BlueCo multi-club ownership group that also controls Chelsea.\n\nRosenior is Chelsea's fourth permanent managerial appointment since BlueCo took control of the club previously owned by Roman Abramovich in 2022.\n\nHe said he had wanted to announce the news himself in Strasbourg because of his deep feelings for the French club.\n\n\"Everything is agreed and it will probably go through in the next few hours,\" Rosenior told reporters.\n\n\"I'm here because I care about this club and I felt it was right to answer your questions physically here today before I move on.\"\n\nRosenior, whose father Leroy was also a player and then a manager, has never faced the kind of media glare that will await him in west London.\n\n\"I'm so excited about the future. I cannot lie. My whole life I've worked to be a coach,\" he said.\n\n\"To be presented with this opportunity to manage a world-class football club is something I've always dreamed of.\n\n\"With that is a mixed emotion of sadness of what I'm leaving behind.\"\n\nRosenior played in the Premier League and the second-tier Championship in England. His clubs included Fulham, Reading and Hull.\n\nHe had a variety of coaching roles at Derby, which included 12 matches as caretaker manager at the start of the 2022/23 season.\n\nLater that year Rosenior took over as manager of Championship team Hull.\n\nHe was sacked after 18 months and in July 2024 was appointed by Strasbourg, whom he guided to seventh place in Ligue 1 last season.\n\nMaresca left Chelsea abruptly on New Year's Day following a deterioration in his relationship with club bosses, just months after winning the UEFA Conference League and Club World Cup.\n\nUnder-21s coach Calum McFarlane took charge for Sunday's 1-1 draw at Manchester City and will likely continue for the Premier League match at Fulham on Wednesday.\n\nReports said that Rosenior's first game in the dugout would be Saturday's FA Cup third-round tie at Championship side Charlton.\n\nChelsea are fifth in the Premier League, 17 points behind Arsenal, with just one win in their past eight league games.",

    "fullText": "NFL playoff picks, predictions for AFC, NFC brackets and Super Bowl 60 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nBuckle up, folks — it's playoff season in the NFL.\n\nThe 2025 season was an abnormal one, and the postseason bracket exemplifies that. Both No. 1 seeds from last year — the Kansas City Chiefs and Detroit Lions — failed to make the playoffs, and the AFC is without Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson.\n\nTeams such as the Seattle Seahawks, Denver Broncos, Jacksonville Jaguars, Chicago Bears and New England Patriots all took major leaps forward this year. The Seahawks and Broncos have the byes in each conference to the divisional round, with their defense propelling them to the top of the standings.\n\nBelow are Sporting News' predictions for the 2026 NFL playoffs, complete with updated Super Bowl 60 picks. Our NFL experts break down the brackets and project which players will break out, which contenders will break down, and which teams will break through during the postseason.\n\nNFL playoff power rankings, 1-14\n\nBill Bender: Buffalo Bills. Kansas City isn't in the way this year. Josh Allen is 7-2 against everybody else in the playoffs – but the only thing holding us back is that Buffalo will have to prove it on the road. Allen is 0-4 on the road in the postseason and the path starts at Jacksonville. The Jaguars have allowed more than 20 points one time through a seven-game win streak.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: The Houston Texans. The Texans are the hottest team in the NFL with a stifling defense and an offense that has found a rhythm. Quietly, Houston has won a playoff game in back-to-back seasons, giving them experience at the biggest stage that the top of this year's AFC field doesn't possess. If CJ Stroud plays to an efficient level, this team has the formula to win anywhere in January.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Los Angeles Rams. This might be rather obvious but they have a rejuvenated MVP-caliber Matthew Stafford at QB with Sean McVay as their coach, the combination that helped them win Super Bowl 56 with similar support from the receiving corps, defense and running game. They were also smart to drive for the No. 5 seed so they get the easiest road game early, before a potential toss-up rematch with the Seahawks\n\nDaniel Mader: The Buffalo Bills. The AFC bracket is loaded with up-and-coming, yet unproven quarterbacks — this is the best chance Josh Allen has ever had to reach the Super Bowl, even as a No. 6 seed. Buffalo’s five-loss record doesn’t concern me much, nor does the lack of a true WR1 or a defense that has struggled at times. With Allen, the Bills are capable of beating any team in the AFC.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: The Los Angeles Rams remain one of the most well-rounded teams in the NFL. A strong run game and the efforts of Davante Adams and Puka Nacua as wide receivers carry the offense. Adams missed the end of the regular season so that he could help up for the playoffs, and he is expected to be back. Los Angeles goes on the road to take on the Carolina Panthers in the first round, where the Rams lost 31-28 in Week 13. Still, the Rams are set up for an easy first-round matchup and should go on a deep run as long as they don't completely look past the Panthers in the first round.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Los AngelesRams. Special mention for the 49ers, Texans, Patriots, Jaguars, Bills and Eagles, all of whom could easily contend for a Super Bowl crown. But Los Angeles is a well-rounded unit that has gamers on both sides of the ball. The Rams are the NFL's most explosive offense and have enjoyed a fair few shutdown showings on defense.\n\nEd Williams: Los Angeles Rams. This team checks all of the boxes of a true Super Bowl threat. First and foremost, the Rams defeated the Bengals in Super Bowl 56 just a few years ago. While some key names like Cooper Kupp and Aaron Donald are missing from that squad, younger playmakers like Puka Nacua and Jared Verse have risen to prominence since then. Matthew Stafford is an MVP favorite, and Davante Adams as emerged as a favorite red zone target. And Sean McVay is widely considered one of the best coaches in the league. The defense can give up yards and points, but they're also dynamic and capable of forcing turnovers at any time. As far as wild-card teams go, no one is looking forward to the Rams coming to town.\n\nBill Bender: Philadelphia Eagles. The Jaguars are an underdog and the Bears line against the Packers will be short either way. Those are not upsets. The 49ers – despite all the injuries – still have a defense that ranked 11th against the run. Brock Purdy had a 111 passer rating on the road. Philadelphia finished 5-3 at home this season – and that included a 1-2 record against playoff teams. Will the Super Bowl champions be an early exit?\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Philadelphia Eagles. The defending champions have had a rocky season, winning the NFC East on the backs of a strong defense. But the offensive issues have persisted throughout the season and remain a problem entering the playoffs. While the defense is one of the best, the Eagles will have to find a way to score consistently in order to make it back to the Super Bowl. With a tough 49ers team on tap first, the Eagles offensive concerns could send them home quickly.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Chicago Bears. They've been living on the edge with some low-scoring games and fourth-quarter comebacks. It's been a massive breakthrough season all around with Caleb Williams and Ben Johnson, but they can be in trouble right away vs. the Packers if they don't get the turnovers to bounce in their favor.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Chicago Bears. Ben Johnson has clearly elevated this franchise in every way it hoped he would, and this has been a terrific Bears season that offers plenty of hope for the future. But I do think some one-score luck played a big role in Chicago’s 11-6 record, and I question how sustainable it is. Anything can happen in divisional games. I buy the Packers’ playoff experience over the Bears.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: No disrespect to the Jacksonville Jaguars; they have had an incredible bounce-back season. Looking at the first-round matchups for the top teams, though, Jacksonville will have to host Buffalo. The Bills went 12-5 this season and that was playing well below their potential. Yes, Buffalo has to hit the road, but if it all comes together for them as it can and Josh Allen looks like the player who won the MVP Award last season, it could easily be an early postseason exit for the Jaguars.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Denver Broncos. Denver enjoyed a wondrous campaign under Sean Payton and its defense is arguably the NFL's best, surrendering the third-fewest points in the league. But there's reason to believe the Broncos' luck could be running out. They were 11-2 in one-score games this season, a record that, while impressive, could be hard to maintain against the AFC's best sides. Bo Nix still leaves something to be desired and the Broncos' toils against teams like the Jets, Giants, Raiders and Commanders suggests they're not quite the juggernaut their record would initially indicate.\n\nEd Williams: Jacksonville Jaguars. The turnaround Liam Coen has pulled off in Jacksonville is impressive, and he probably should be getting more attention for Coach of the Year. But unfortunately for them, they draw Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills. Some of the game's biggest names at QB will be missing from the postseason this year like Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson, but the reigning MVP is back as a 12-5 No. 6 seed. While his receiving weapons won't instill fear into opposing defenses themselves, Allen's ability to take over a game at any moment certainly can cause sleepless nights. And on top of that, James Cook was the league's leading rusher and gives them another threat to break off chunk plays. Trevor Lawrence will have to keep his hot streak going to keep pace with Allen, and the much-improved Jags defense will need to prove this isn't the same old Jags. It's not an impossible task, but the Jags likely would have preferred to see the Chargers or Texans.\n\nBill Bender: Bills QB Josh Allen. Matthew Stafford and Drake Maye are acceptable answers – and the potential for a third matchup between the Bills and Patriots could be in the cards. Allen has everything but a Super Bowl appearance on his resume at this point. It's time to change that.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Will Anderson: Ten years ago, Von Miller capped his incredible playoff run with a Super Bowl in San Francisco, providing a blueprint for Will Anderson. If it weren't for Myles Garrett's record-breaking season, Anderson would be among the favorites to win Defensive Player of the Year, as his career-high 12 sacks sparked the Texans defense to the top of the NFL. With a few of the top quarterbacks sitting at home, it will be a defensive player shining the brightest in January.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence. There's every reason to believe he will keep this hot streak groove in full command of Liam Coen's balanced and explosive offense into the playoffs. The Bills' defense has plenty of holes to exploit in the wild-card round and he's already proved he can rip Denver's defense. He will keep breaking out on delay as the No. 1 pick talent he was supposed to be, five years after he was drafted.\n\nDaniel Mader: The man who can still be considered the reigning league MVP, Josh Allen. Buffalo’s star quarterback seemed to get better as the regular season went on, and I think he’ll continue that trend into the postseason without any Patrick Mahomes-shaped ghosts to worry about. Allen can be considered the most dynamic individual talent in the 2026 playoffs.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: Drake Maye and head coach Mike Vrabel seem like the perfect marriage, poised to be a threat in the AFC for years to come. Just when the league got past the dominance of New England, this duo is bringing it back. Maye can run Vrabel's offense, and the defensive-minded head coach can focus on what he knows best. Maye might miss out on the regular-season MVP Award, but he has a great chance to win playoff MVP because he likely won't be benched in the third quarter because of huge leads.\n\nDavid Suggs:Puka Nacua. If the Rams are to win the Super Bowl, their third-year pass-catcher will be among the biggest reasons why. Nacua is as steady as they come, finding success against both man and zone coverages. I reckon he'll keep the good times rolling during the playoffs.\n\nEd Williams: Jalen Hurts. The Eagles offense has not exactly been a thing of beauty during the regular season, but Jalen Hurts has a habit of playing his best football when the lights are brightest. Passing game struggles were a common issue in 2024 as well, but when the playoffs came around, the Eagles seemed to flip a switch and were airing it out seemingly at will. Last year they also had a historic season from Saquon Barkley in the running game. That has not been the case in 2025, as the offensive line has struggled mightily. If the Eagles offense is going to flip a switch again, it's likely going to have to be Jalen Hurts. The weapons are there with A.J. Brown, DeVonte Smith and Barkley, plus tight end Dallas Goedert has evolved into a deadly red zone target. The Eagles offense is at its best when Jalen Hurts is also hurting defenses with his legs, and now that they're in the postseason and it's win or go home, look for him to run more often than he did during the regular season. The playcalling and sequencing from rookie offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo hasn't done Hurts any favors this season, but the reigning Super Bowl MVP can block out all the noise and silence his doubters once and for all if he can lead Philly back to the promised land.\n\nBill Bender: Rams defensive end Jared Verse. Verse had five pressures or \n\nDaniel Chavkin: RJ Harvey. Fantasy players know how talented RJ Harvey is, but it's time for the rookie to break out in the biggest moment. The Broncos offense will need Harvey to provide a spark in the running game and give Bo Nix a reliable back, allowing them to make a run to the Super Bowl. Harvey didn't surpass 75 yards in any game during his rookie season, but expect that to change once Denver takes the field in January.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Patriots edge rusher Harold Landry. The former Titan has been more impactful down the stretch rushing the passer for Mike Vrabel and he can be a more disruptive defensive force the team needs against better QBs in the playoffs.\n\nDaniel Mader: I’ll throw out a pair of Jaguars offensive weapons here: wide receiver Parker Washington and tight end Brenton Strange. While Jacksonville gets a tough first-round matchup against Buffalo, I’ve found it impressive how Trevor Lawrence has continued to thrive despite Brian Thomas Jr. not being the same talent as 2024 and Travis Hunter’s season ending early. Washington and Strange can make a bigger name for themselves if they help the Jags take down the Bills.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: Seahawks linebacker Ernest Jones IV led Seattle with 126 total tackles on the year. He is a beast in coverage and it is hard for any runner to get past him when he goes to tackle them. Jones has had a phenomenal year when dropping into pass coverage too. He has seven passes defended and leads Seattle with an impressive five interceptions, the second-most by any player in the NFL this year. You've likely heard of rookie safety Nick Emmanwori for Seattle, but be ready to get to know Jones.\n\nDavid Suggs:Woody Marks. The Texans' rookie numbers don't necessarily pop off the page at first glance. But he established himself as Houston's No. 1 tailback as the season wore on, tallying 15 or more carries in five of his last seven games. Marks is a gifted pass-catcher in space whose elusiveness figures to cause problems for opposition defenses. He should prove to be one of C.J. Stroud's favorite safety blankets.\n\nEd Williams: Eagles linebacker Jalyx Hunt spent three years at Cornell playing safety before transferring to Houston Christian University, where he transitioned to a linebacker/EDGE player. The Eagles drafted him in the third round at pick 94, which seemed like it might have been a reach at the time. But Hunt's development in Vic Fangio's system has been something to behold. He flashed some serious potential in his limited opportunities as a rookie, but after the Eagles let Josh Sweat walk in free agency and with Brandon Graham's retirement and Nolan Smith's triceps injury to start the season, Hunt was thrust into a starting role. Hunt was thrown right into the deep end, and he's really excelled in the expanded role. He leads the team in pressures (55), QB hits (24), sacks (6.5) and interceptions (3). In fact, he leads all EDGE rushers in the NFL with three picks. His 21.2% pressure rate on third down is 8th among NFL EDGE rushers this year. He's the only player in the history of the Eagles franchise to lead the team in both INTs and sacks. The Eagles can bring pressure in many ways, but Hunt just seems to get better and better the more he plays, and the scary thing is, he's still relatively new to the position.\n\nBill Bender: Los Angeles Rams. Matthew Stafford is playing at a MVP level, and they are good enough to make a run through the NFC. Sean McVay knows how to move the pieces with Kyren Williams and Puka Nacua. Davante Adams should return for the playoff run. The Seahawks were the only team in the NFC that limited Los Angeles to 21 points or less this season.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Jacksonville Jaguars. Since Week 7, the Jaguars have scored at least 23 points in all 11 games, including seven games with at least 30 points. Head coach Liam Coen has Trevor Lawrence playing at a high level, which included dropping 34 points on the Denver Broncos in Week 16. Many of this year's playoff teams are defense-first teams, but it was Jacksonville's scorching-hot offense that led the Jaguars back to the playoffs.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Los Angeles Rams. Matthew Stafford and Sean McVay get it done with so many skill players behind a strong offensive line. They can dominate with wide receivers or burn you with tight ends. They can also now field a 1-2 punch in the power running game. The Rams have a consistent floor and a high ceiling.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Los Angeles Rams. Matthew Stafford had a career year, which says a lot at age 37. I think the Rams go as far as their young defense takes them, meaning I expect Stafford’s arm to continue thriving in the playoffs. I’m not confident the Seahawks, Eagles or any other team can slow down Puka Nacua and Davante Adams for 60 minutes.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: The Los Angeles Rams are getting healthy and that is going to be a problem for defenses. Even when Los Angeles didn't have Davante Adams through the end of the season, tight end Tyler Higbee was activated off of IR and had 91 yards and a touchdown. Add in Adams to Kyren Williams, Puka Nacua, Tyler Higbee and Colby Parkinson and you've got one of the deeper offenses in the playoffs. Oh, and L.A. happened to score the most points per game (30.1) during the regular season.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Los Angeles Rams. They led the league in scoring and averaged 31.75 points across four matchups with the Seahawks and 49ers. Matthew Stafford was a revelation this year, while Los Angeles boasts perhaps the best pass-catching tandem in the sport in Puka Nacua and Davante Adams. I think the points will keep on flowing in Tinseltown.\n\nEd Williams: Los Angeles Rams. Sean McVay can get conservative at times, but when push comes to shove, give me Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua, Davante Adams, the Kyren Williams/Blake Corum duo at running back and the playcalling and offensive scheming of the head coach over any other team in the postseason. Josh Allen may be the most dynamic quarterback in the playoffs, but the Rams are the most complete offense. You can get pressure on Matthew Stafford, but he's also capable of getting the ball out quickly and he can throw at weird angles to get around defenders in pursuit. If the defense isn't finishing and bringing him down, the Rams could go all the way.\n\nBill Bender: Houston Texans. Houston hasn't given up more than 21 points in a game since Week 10 – and they allowed an average of 15.4 points per game on the road this season. The Texans allowed 30 points in Week 18 – but we're not worried about that. The tandem of Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr. can wreck a game plan – and that should bring more than enough confidence going into a matchup with the AFC North champions.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Seattle Seahawks. It's hard to hold the 49ers to three points in San Francisco, but that's exactly what the Seahawks did on Saturday. Under second-year head coach Mike MacDonald, Seattle's defense can match up against any offense, especially when they won't have to leave Seattle for the rest of the NFC playoffs. Combine incredible talent with a high-level defensive play-caller, and you get the most trustworthy defense in the league.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Seattle Seahawks. They have become super stingy against the pass with pressure and coverage clicking and they always have been tough to run against. In a season of big-time scoring, they held opponents to an average of 17.2 points per game.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Seattle Seahawks. Mike Macdonald looks like a home-run hire for Seattle, with a terrific blend of versatility, dominant pass rushing and overall disruptiveness on his defensive unit. The Seahawks are like an inverse Rams to me: I expect their defense to win games, but the bigger question is whether Sam Darnold is ready to take a leap toward playoff success.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: The Seattle Seahawks earned the No. 1 seed in the NFC partly due to having the league's leading wide receiver, but also boasting one of the best defenses in the NFL. This feels the closest the Seahawks have been to re-capturing the Legion of Boom dominance as the unit finds itself in the top-10 for several defensive metrics. Seattle's defense ranks 2nd in points against per game, fifth in first downs allowed, sixth in total yards allowed. The Seahawks have given up the 12th-fewest passing yards and third-fewest rushing yards per game.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Houston Texans. Houston's defense has it all; tough tacklers are littered across the front seven, while the secondary is awash with starlight. DeMeco Ryans' side conceded just 14 to the Rams, 15 to the 49ers, 17 to the Jaguars and 19 to the Bills. I'm expecting them to offer similar displays during postseason play.\n\nEd Williams: Philadelphia Eagles. There have been a couple blips on the radar along the way, but the Eagles' defense has really carried the team in 2025. While the offense has gone through highly-publicized struggles this season, one of the youngest defenses in the league has outperformed expectations. Quinyon Mitchell followed up his impressive rookie campaign by being the only cornerback in the league to be targeted 60+ times and not allow a TD (82 targets). He also allowed the lowest completion percentage among all cornerbacks. Cooper DeJean is already one of, if not the best nickel cornerbacks in the league, and the linebacker tandem of Zach Baun and Nakobe Dean might be the best in the league. The defensive front is stacked with Jalen Carter finally looking healthier after shoulder issues, Jordan Davis enjoying a career year, Nolan Smith rounding into form, Jalyx Hunt continuing to ascend and free agent acquisition Jaelan Phillips paying immediate dividends. But the X-factor is Vic Fangio who always seems to have an answer at the most important times. This defense can give up yards and production, but while they may bend, they don't typically break and tighten things up in the red zone.\n\nBill Bender: Buffalo Bills. Too much belief? Buffalo was 3-3 against teams that are in the postseason this year, but it's time for the breakthrough. James Cook will keep the running game going. Buffalo has just one turnover in its last four games. Can they go through Jacksonville, New England and Denver to get back to the Super Bowl for the first time since 1993?\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Houston Texans. The Texans have never made it to the AFC Championship game, but that ends this year on their trip to the Super Bowl. Houston has a defense that can travel on the road and win anywhere, which will help carry the Texans to cold-weather cities in the dead of winter. Plus, DeMeco Ryans is already one of the best young coaches in the NFL, and he will show why with a deep playoff run.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Jacksonville Jaguars. Their profile has fewer weaknesses by the passing week. Trevor Lawrence fills the elite AFC QB void left by no Patrick Mahomes and they suddenly look loaded there, playing off Travis Etienne and the running game. Their defense is also opportunistic in forcing takeaways in crucial game-changing moments.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Buffalo Bills. Part of my reasoning is that I simply can’t yet trust the crop of Bo Nix, Drake Maye, Trevor Lawrence or Justin Herbert until one of those quarterbacks breaks through and proves they can lead a team to multiple playoff wins. Until then, I won’t bet against Josh Allen, the most proven and dynamic quarterback in the playoffs. Down the stretch of close games, he’s who I think can lead a team through the bracket.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: The turnaround in one year has been impressive for the New England Patriots. The Patriots have a great quarterback and a pair of running backs that can help consistently get the offense down the field. As long as Stefon Diggs' off-the-field issues don't prevent him from playing in the playoffs, New England is in a prime position to get back to the Super Bowl, and will match up well no matter who the Patriots play in the postseason.\n\nDavid Suggs: The Jacksonville Jaguars. Call this one wishful thinking. But the Jaguars have been on a tear as of late, vanquishing eight straight sides to climb to the upper echelons of the AFC. Trevor Lawrence has looked every bit like the highly-touted talent he was suggested to be while in college. Jacksonville shone in wins over the Texans, 49ers, Chargers and Broncos. Liam Coen's bunch will keep the good times rolling in the playoffs.\n\nEd Williams: Buffalo Bills. Both the AFC and NFC are really wide open this year. The Bills are a 6-seed, so they'll likely have to be on the road the entire postseason, but Josh Allen is the best quarterback in the postseason. Drake Maye has put together an MVP-caliber campaign in just his second year, but they also have had a relatively easy schedule. This will be his first taste of the postseason, while Allen is no stranger to the perils of postseason play. If the Bills are able to get by Jacksonville in the first round, barring a Chargers upset of the Patriots, they'll get the Broncos in the divisional round. While the Broncos have a great defense, the two teams also met in the playoffs last year, and the Bills emerged with a convincing 31-7 victory. While it would likely be much closer this time around, I'll take Josh Allen over Bo Nix any day of the week.\n\nBill Bender: Los Angeles Rams. This is a tough pick because we believe they will have to go through the Seahawks to get there. Seattle is a real threat, and Sam Darnold has been on point all season. We think those teams will see each other in either the divisional round or the NFC championship game – and a rematch of the 38-37 thriller in Week 16 is in order. The Rams had 581 yards in that game.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Seattle Seahawks. Getting home-field advantage was crucial for the Seahawks, as there is no tougher place to play in January than Seattle. With the NFC full of fierce opponents, the bye will help the Seahawks get healthy and prepare while their opponents battle on wild-card weekend. As long as Sam Darnold can protect the football, which he has done for most of the season, Seattle should be favored to make it out of the NFC.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Seattle Seahawks. This is an odd feeling that they are back in a position to win a Super Bowl far removed from Russell Wilson and Pete Carroll days. Mike Macdonald has created a dominant defense that can win a championship with Sam Darnold just needing to protect the ball as a complementary QB.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Los Angeles Rams. Playing in a loaded NFC West was tough for L.A. after a strong start to the season, but I still think this is the most talented offense in football with a young defense that has stepped up plenty of times before. If the Rams can avoid their previous special teams issues, their path to the Super Bowl is there: beat an 8-9 Panthers team, take down a familiar Seahawks squad in the divisional round, then overcome the Eagles, 49ers, Packers or Bears, all of whom have their flaws, in the NFC Championship Game.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: I think the Los Angeles Rams beat the Carolina Panthers, but then benefit from the San Francisco 49ers beating the Philadelphia Eagles. This would allow Los Angeles to face the Chicago Bears before either the Seattle Seahawks or the Niners in the NFC Championship game. I think the Rams have the deepest offense and the second-best defense in the NFC playoff picture which should help them to win the NFC.\n\nDavid Suggs:The Los Angeles Rams. Losses to the Seahawks and Falcons scuppered what looked to be a push for the NFC's No. 1 seed in Los Angeles. But Stafford has been the league's best hurler and has a championship pedigree. Sean McVay will have the Rams ready for the winter, just as they were in 2019 and 2022. Los Angeles fell just short of the NFC Championship last year. It will do one better in 2025, beating all comers to punch its ticket for the Super Bowl.\n\nEd Williams: Philadelphia Eagles. While it hasn't been pretty at times, Philadelphia managed to avoid a true Super Bowl hangover and are not only back in the postseason, but broke the NFC East curse and won the division for the second straight year — the first time that feat has been accomplished since the Eagles won four straight division titles from 2001-2004. The defense has carried the team at times, but the talent on the offensive side of the ball cannot be discounted. Even though they've struggled with consistency, Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown, DeVonta Adams, Saquon Barkley and company are capable of beating any defense if they are all on the same page. Jalen Hurts has proven he doesn't shrink in the spotlight, and that experience can help carry them through some tough matchups along the way. The two seeds above them in the Seattle Seahawks and Chicago Bears do not boast much postseason experience, so it's not out of the question that Eagles can gain more home-field advantage along the way, and The Linc is a difficult place to play, especially in the colder months.\n\nBill Bender: Buffalo Bills beat Los Angeles Rams. Two wild-card teams? It's a risky pick, but this is a wide-open playoff. Defense matters, and the Rams had some late-season concerns. It's not just about Josh Allen and Matthew Stafford, but in the playoffs, the QBs take center stage. Would Stafford win a second Super Bowl? Or will Buffalo finally win a Super Bowl? Allen finally gets it done.\n\nDaniel Chavkin: Houston Texans over Seattle Seahawks. It's been a weird year in the NFL, so it's only fitting that the Super Bowl champion is an unexpected victor. DeMeco Ryan and the Texans are on a nine-game winning streak entering the playoffs, and thanks to a strong defense and timely offense, will ride the winning streak four more games to a Super Bowl title in a low-scoring battle against Seattle.\n\nVinnie Iyer: Jacksonville Jaguars over Seattle Seahawks. In the ultimate season of surprise, let's go for a team that has never been to a Super Bowl to win a Super Bowl on its first try. Lawrence gives the Jaguars a QB equalizer or edge over most teams and the Jaguars match up well with the Seahawks as they excel at forcing takeaways and the Seahawks often have trouble with giveaways.\n\nDaniel Mader: The Los Angeles Rams. There are plenty of reasons to doubt L.A., as there are for every team in the bracket this season, but between the Rams’ head coach, terrific quarterback play, talented wide receiver duo and group of defensive playmakers, I still think they have another gear to reach. Give me the Rams’ second Super Bowl win in five years.\n\nTeddy Ricketson: It hurts taking the New England Patriots to win another Super Bowl after we had to deal with their recent dynasty, but no matter the matchup they face this postseason, they should be favored or at the very least match up well. If they had a more prolific WR2 in the offense, it feels like New England would be everyone's favorite. I think the Patriots and Rams play each other in the Super Bowl, and New England is able to do just enough to win another ring.\n\nDavid Suggs:The Los Angeles Rams. I just think they've got a really balanced side that is capable of causing opposition sides problems in a number of ways. McVay, Stafford and Los Angeles beat the Jaguars to hoist their second Lombardi Trophy since returning to Hollywood.\n\nEd Williams: Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles just outlasted the Bills a couple of weeks ago in Week 17 of the regular season, but that could have been just a preview of what we might see in the Super Bowl. While Levi's Stadium is not a dome, it's also not likely they'll have to deal with monsoon freezing rain conditions like the two squads just dealt with in Buffalo. The offenses should be able to put more points on the board, but it's the Eagles defense that will come up big in limiting Josh Allen, and Jalen Hurts will silence his critics once again with another Super Bowl MVP award.",

    "fullText": "The Boston Celtics secured a 115-101 win over the Chicago Bulls on Monday, January 5, jumping to second in the Eastern Conference as a result. Joe Mazzulla’s team, coming off the back of a four-game West Coast swing, was far from at its best.\n\nNevertheless, the Celtics found a way to win what became a scrappy game. A significant part of the Celtics’ performance was their work on the offensive glass, securing 20 offensive rebounds and turning that into 26 second-chance points.\n\nAnfernee Simons also enjoyed a stellar shooting night after struggling in the first half. He ended the game with 27 points, 3 rebounds and 3 assists, knocking down 9-of-16 from the field, which included 8-of-14 shooting from deep.\n\nDuring his postgame news conference, Bulls’ head coach, Billy Donovan, spoke glowingly about the Celtics roster, even labelling Jaylen Brown as a potential MVP candidate.\n\n“I’ve got a lot of respect for Jaylen,” Donovan said. “You know, he’s obviously playing at probably an MVP level, or at least in consideration. Pritchard, I’ve always had great respect for. White, the same thing. Hauser can really shoot it. They have a really, really good, high-IQ team, shooting team. I think the pickup of Simons coming off the bench has given them a lot of firepower.”\n\n“Tatum obviously, you know, is elite offensively,” Donovan continued. “He can score a lot of different ways, but I think what happens is when you have a big-time scorer that goes out like that, it doesn’t necessarily fall just on one guy. Everybody kind of shares in that, so to speak. And they’ve been, all year long ,pretty elite offensively. They’ve got the fourth-best offense, you know.”\n\nAfter a stellar 50-point game against the LA Clippers on Saturday, January 3, Brown was quiet against the Bulls. Nevertheless, he still played a role in helping Boston secure another win. The Celtics will be back in action on Wednesday, January 7, when the 24-12 Denver Nuggets roll into town.\n\nBulls Coach Explains What Celtics Did That “Gave Them a Big Margin”",

    "title": "Kenya's Great Carbon Valley: a bold new gamble to fight climate change",
    "description": "One project aims to harness local geothermal resources to pull CO2 from the air. Will it prove that carbon removal can really help our warming planet?",
    "fullText": "The earth around Lake Naivasha, a shallow freshwater basin in south-central Kenya, does not seem to want to lie still.\n\nAsh from nearby Mount Longonot, which erupted as recently as the 1860s, remains in the ground. Obsidian caves and jagged stone towers preside over the steam that spurts out of fissures in the soil and wafts from pools of boiling-hot water—produced by magma that, in some areas, sits just a few miles below the surface.\n\nIt’s a landscape born from violent geologic processes some 25 million years ago, when the Nubian and Somalian tectonic plates pulled apart. That rupture cut a depression in the earth some 4,000 miles long—from East Africa up through the Middle East—to create what’s now called the Great Rift Valley.\n\nThis volatility imbues the land with vast potential, much of it untapped. The area, no more than a few hours’ drive from Nairobi, is home to five geothermal power stations, which harness the clouds of steam to generate about a quarter of Kenya’s electricity. But some energy from this process escapes into the atmosphere, while even more remains underground for lack of demand.\n\nThat’s what brought Octavia Carbon here.\n\nIn June, just north of the lake in the small but strategically located town of Gilgil, the startup began running a high-stakes test. It’s harnessing some of that excess energy to power four prototypes of a machine that promises to remove carbon dioxide from the air in a manner that the company says is efficient, affordable, and—crucially—scalable.\n\nIn the short term, the impact will be small—each device’s initial capacity is just 60 tons per year of CO₂—but the immediate goal is simply to demonstrate that carbon removal here is possible. The longer-term vision is far more ambitious: to prove that direct air capture (DAC), as the process is known, can be a powerful tool to help the world keep temperatures from rising to ever more dangerous levels.\n\n“We believe we are doing what we can here in Kenya to address climate change and lead the charge for positioning Kenya as a climate vanguard,” Specioser Mutheu, Octavia’s communications lead, told me when I visited the country last year.\n\nThe United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has stated that in order to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 °C over preindustrial levels (the threshold set out in the Paris Agreement), or even the more realistic but still difficult 2 °C, it will need to significantly reduce future fossil-fuel emissions—and also pull from the atmosphere billions of tons of carbon that have already been released.\n\nSome argue that DAC, which uses mechanical and chemical processes to suck carbon dioxide from the air and store it in a stable form (usually underground), is the best way to do that. It’s a technology with immense promise, offering the possibility that human ingenuity and innovation can get us out of the same mess that development caused in the first place.\n\nLast year, the world’s largest DAC plant, Mammoth, came online in Iceland, offering the eventual capacity to remove up to 36,000 tons of CO₂ per year—roughly equal to the emissions of 7,600 gas-powered cars. The idea is that DAC plants like this one will remove and permanently store carbon and create carbon credits that can be purchased by corporations, governments, and local industrial producers, which will collectively help keep the world from experiencing the most dangerous effects of climate change.\n\nNow, Octavia and a growing number of other companies, politicians, and investors from Africa, the US, and Europe are betting that Kenya’s unique environment holds the keys to reaching this lofty goal—which is why they’re pushing a sweeping vision to remake the Great Rift Valley into the “Great Carbon Valley.” And they hope to do so in a way that provides a genuine economic boost for Kenya, while respecting the rights of the Indigenous people who live on this land. If they can do so, the project could not just give a needed jolt to the DAC industry—it could also provide proof of concept for DAC across the Global South, which is particularly vulnerable to the ravages of climate change despite bearing very little responsibility for it.\n\nBut DAC is also a controversial technology, unproven at scale and wildly expensive to operate. In May, an Icelandic news outlet published an investigation into Climeworks, which runs the Mammoth plant, finding that it didn’t even pull in enough carbon dioxide to offset its own emissions, let alone the emissions of other companies.\n\nCritics also argue that the electricity DAC requires can be put to better use cleaning up our transportation systems, heating our homes, and powering other industries that still rely largely on fossil fuels. What’s more, they say that relying on DAC can give polluters an excuse to delay the transition to renewables indefinitely. And further complicating this picture is shrinking demand from governments and corporations that would be DAC’s main buyers, which has left some experts questioning whether the industry will even survive.\n\nCarbon removal is a technology that seems always on the verge of kicking in but never does, says Fadhel Kaboub, a Tunisian economist and advocate for an equitable green transition. “You need billions of dollars of investment in it, and it’s not delivering, and it’s not going to deliver anytime soon. So why do we put the entire future of the planet in the hands of a few people and a technology that doesn’t deliver?”\n\nLayered on top of concerns about the viability and wisdom of DAC is a long history of distrust from the Maasai people who have called the Great Rift Valley home for generations but have been displaced in waves by energy companies coming in to tap the land’s geothermal reserves. And many of those remaining don’t even have access to the electricity generated by these plants.\n\nIt’s an immensely complicated landscape to navigate. But if the project can indeed make it through, Benjamin Sovacool, an energy policy researcher and director of the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability, sees immense potential for countries that have been historically marginalized from climate policy and green energy investment. Though he’s skeptical about DAC as a near-term climate solution, he says these nations could still see big benefits from what could be a multitrillion-dollar industry.\n\n“[Of] all the technologies we have available to fight climate change, the idea of reversing it by sucking CO₂ out of the air and storing it is really attractive. It’s something even an ordinary person can just get,” Sovacool says. “If we’re able to do DAC at scale, it could be the next huge energy transition.”\n\nBut first, of course, the Great Carbon Valley has to actually deliver.\n\nThe “Great Carbon Valley” is both a broad vision for the region and a company founded to shepherd that vision into reality.\n\nBilha Ndirangu, a 42-year-old MIT electrical engineering graduate who grew up in Nairobi, has long worried about the impacts of climate change on Kenya. But she doesn’t want the country to be a mere victim of rising temperatures, she tells me; she hopes to see it become a source of climate solutions. So in 2021, Ndirangu cofounded Jacob’s Ladder Africa, a nonprofit with the goal of preparing African workers for green industries.\n\nShe also began collaborating with the Kenyan entrepreneur James Irungu Mwangi, the CEO of Africa Climate Ventures, an investment firm focused on building and accelerating climate-smart businesses. He’d been working on an idea that spoke to their shared belief in the potential for the country’s vast geothermal capacity; the plan was to find buyers for Kenya’s extra geothermal energy in order to kick-start the development of even more renewable power. One energy-hungry, climate-positive industry stood out: direct air capture of carbon dioxide.\n\nThe Great Rift Valley was the key to this vision. The thinking was that it could provide the cheap energy needed to power affordable DAC at scale while offering an ideal geology to effectively store carbon deep underground after it was extracted from the air. And with nearly 90% of the country’s grid already powered by renewable energy, DAC wouldn’t be siphoning power away from other industries that need it. Instead, attracting DAC to Kenya could provide the boost needed for energy providers to build out their infrastructure and expand the grid—ideally connecting the roughly 25% of people in the country who lack electricity and reducing scenarios in which power has to be rationed.\n\n“This push for renewable energy and the decarbonization of industries is providing us with a once-in-a-lifetime sort of opportunity,” Ndirangu tells me.\n\nSo in 2023, the pair founded Great Carbon Valley, a project development company whose mission is attracting DAC companies to the area, along with other energy-intensive industries looking for renewable power.\n\nIt has already brought on high-profile companies like the Belgian DAC startup Sirona Technologies, the French DAC company Yama, and Climeworks, the Swiss company that operates Mammoth and another DAC plant in Iceland (and was on MIT Technology Review’s 10 Breakthrough Technologies list in 2022, and the list of Climate Tech Companies to Watch in 2023). All are planning on launching pilot projects in Kenya in the coming years, with Climeworks announcing plans to complete its Kenyan DAC plant by 2028. GCV has also partnered with Cella, an American carbon-storage company that works with Octavia, and is facilitating permits for the Icelandic company Carbfix, which injects the carbon from Climeworks’ DAC facilities.\n\n“Climate change is disproportionately impacting this part of the world, but it’s also changing the rules of the game all over the world,” Cella CEO and cofounder Corey Pattison tells me, explaining the draw of Mwangi and Ndirangu’s concept. “This is also an opportunity to be entrepreneurial and creative in our thinking, because there are all of these assets that places like Kenya have.”\n\nNot only can the country offer cheap and abundant renewable energy, but supporters of Kenyan DAC hope that the young and educated local workforce can supply the engineers and scientists needed to build out this infrastructure. In turn, the business could open opportunities to the country’s roughly 6 million un- or under-employed youths.\n\n“It’s not a one-off industry,” Ndirangu says, highlighting her faith in the idea that jobs will flow from green industrialization. Engineers will be needed to monitor the DAC facilities, and the additional demand for renewable power will create jobs in the energy sector, along with related services like water and hospitality.\n\n“You’re developing a whole range of infrastructure to make this industry possible,” she adds. “That infrastructure is not just good for the industry—it’s also just good for the country.”\n\nIn June of last year, I walked up a dirt path to the HQ of Octavia Carbon, just off Nairobi’s Eastern Bypass Road, on the far outskirts of the city.\n\nThe staffers I met on my tour exuded the kind of boundless optimism that’s common in early-stage startups. “People used to write academic articles about the fact that no human will ever be able to run a marathon in less than two hours,” Octavia CEO Martin Freimüller told me that day. The Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge broke that barrier in a race in 2019. A mural of him features prominently on the wall, along with the athlete’s slogan, “No human is limited.”\n\n“It’s impossible, until Kenya does it,” Freimüller added.\n\nAlthough not an official partner of Ndirangu’s Great Carbon Valley venture, Octavia aligns with the larger vision, he told me. The company got its start in 2022, when Freimüller, an Austrian development consultant, met Duncan Kariuki, an engineering graduate from the University of Nairobi, in the OpenAir Collective, an online forum devoted to carbon removal. Kariuki introduced Freimüller to his classmates Fiona Mugambi and Mike Bwondera, and the four began working on a DAC prototype, first in lab space borrowed from the university and later in an apartment. It didn’t take long for neighbors to complain about the noise, and within six months, the operation had moved to its current warehouse.\n\nThat same year, they announced their first prototype, affectionately called Thursday after the day it was unveiled at a Nairobi Climate Network event. Soon, Octavia was showing off its tech to high-profile visitors including King Charles III and President Joe Biden’s ambassador to Kenya, Meg Whitman.\n\nThree years later, the team has more than 40 engineers and has built its 12th DAC unit: a metal cylinder about the size of a large washing machine, containing a chemical filter using an amine, an organic compound derived from ammonia. (Octavia declined to provide further details about the arrangement of the filter inside the machine because the company is awaiting approval of a patent for the design.)\n\nHannah Wanjau, an engineer at the company, explained how it works: Fans draw air from the outside across the filter, causing carbon dioxide (which is acidic) to react with the basic amine and form a carbonate salt. When that mixture is heated inside a vacuum to 80 to 100 °C, the CO₂ is released, now as a gas, and collected in a special chamber, while the amine can be reused for the next round of carbon capture.\n\nThe amine absorption method has been used in other DAC plants around the world, including those operated by Climeworks, but Octavia’s project stands apart on several key fronts. Wanjau explained that its technology is tailored to suit the local climate; the company has adjusted the length of time for absorption and the temperature for CO₂ release, making it a potential model for other countries in the tropics.\n\nAnd then there’s its energy \n\nThis technology is being tested in the field in Gilgil, where Mutheu told me the company is “continuing to capture and condition CO₂ as part of our ongoing operations and testing cycles.” (She declined to provide specific data or results at this stage.)\n\nOnce the CO₂ is captured, it will be heated and pressurized. Then it will be pumped to a nearby storage facility operated by Cella, where the company will inject the gas into fissures underground. The region’s special geology again offers an advantage: Much of the rock found underground here is basalt, a volcanic mineral that contains high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions. They react with carbon dioxide to form substances like calcite, dolomite, and magnesite, locking the carbon atoms away in the form of solid minerals.\n\nThis process is more durable than other forms of carbon storage, making it potentially more attractive to buyers of carbon credits, says Pattison, the Cella CEO. Non-geologic carbon mitigation methods, such as cookstove replacement programs or nature-based solutions like tree planting, have recently been rocked by revelations of fraud or exaggeration. The money for Cella’s pilot, which will see the injection of 200 tons of CO₂ this year, has come mainly from the Frontier advance market commitment, under which a group of companies including Stripe, Google, Shopify, Meta, and others has collectively pledged to spend $1 billion on carbon removal by 2030.\n\nThese projects have already opened up possibilities for young Kenyans like Wanjau. She told me there were not a lot of opportunities for aspiring mechanical engineers like her to design and test their own devices; many of her classmates were working for construction or oil companies, or were unemployed. But almost immediately after graduation, Wanjau began working for Octavia.\n\n“I’m happy that I’m trying to solve a problem that’s a real-world issue,” she told me. “Not many people in Africa get a chance to do that.”\n\nDespite the vast enthusiasm from partners and investors, the Great Carbon Valley faces multiple challenges before Ndirangu and Mwangi’s vision can be fully realized.\n\nSince its start, the venture has had to contend with “this perception that doing projects in Africa is risky,” says Ndirangu. Of the dozens of DAC facilities planned or in existence today, only a handful are in the Global South. Indeed, Octavia has described itself as the first DAC plant to be located there. “Even just selling Kenya as a destination for DAC was quite a challenge,” she says.\n\nSo Ndirangu played up Kenya’s experience developing geothermal resources, as well as local engineering talent and a lower cost of labor. GCV has also offered to work with the Kenyan government to help companies secure the proper permits to break ground as soon as possible.\n\nNdirangu says that she’s already seen “a real appetite” from power producers who want to build out more renewable-energy infrastructure, but at the same time they’re waiting for proof of demand. She envisions that once that power is in place, lots of other industries—from data centers to producers of green steel, green ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuels—will consider basing themselves in Kenya, attracting more than a dozen projects to the valley in the next few years.\n\nBut recent events could dampen demand (which some experts already worried was insufficient). Global governments are retreating from climate action, particularly in the US. The Trump administration has dramatically slashed funding for development related to climate change and renewable energy. The Department of Energy appears poised to terminate a $50 million grant to a proposed Louisiana DAC plant that would have been partially operated by Climeworks, and in May, not long after that announcement, the company said it was cutting 22% of its staff.\n\nAt the same time, many companies that would have likely been purchasers of carbon credits—and that a few years ago had voluntarily pledged to reduce or eliminate their carbon emissions—are quietly walking back their commitments. Over the long term, experts warn, there are limits to the amount of carbon removal that companies will ever voluntarily buy. They argue that governments will ultimately have to pay for it—or require polluters to do so.\n\nFurther compounding all these challenges are costs. Critics say DAC investments are a waste of time and money compared with other forms of carbon drawdown. As of mid-December, carbon removal credits in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System, one of the world’s largest carbon markets, were priced at around $84 per ton. The average price per DAC credit, for comparison, is nearly $450. Natural processes like reforestation absorb millions of tons of carbon annually and are far cheaper (though programs to harness them for carbon credits are beset with their own controversies). Ultimately, DAC continues to operate on a small scale, removing only about 10,000 metric tons of CO₂ each year.\n\nEven if DAC suppliers do manage to push past these obstacles, there are still thorny questions coming from inside Kenya. Groups like Power Shift Africa, a Nairobi-based think tank that advocates for climate action on the continent, have derided carbon credits as “pollution permits” and blamed them for delaying the move toward electrification.\n\n“The ultimate goal of [carbon removal] is that you can say at the end, well, we can actually continue our emissions and just recapture them with this technology,” says Kaboub, the Tunisian economist, who has worked with Power Shift Africa. “So there's no need to end fossil fuels, which is why you get a lot of support from oil countries and companies.”\n\nAnother problem he sees is not limited to DAC but extends to the way that Kenya and other African nations are pursuing their goal of green industrialization. While Kenyan president William Ruto has courted international financial investment to turn Kenya into a green energy hub, his administration’s policies have deepened the country’s external debt, which in 2024 was equal to around 30% of its GDP. Geothermal energy development in Kenya has often been financed by loans from international institutions or other governments. As its debt has risen, the country has enacted national austerity measures that have sparked deadly protests.\n\nKenya may indeed have advantages over other countries, and DAC costs will most likely go down eventually. But some experts, such as Boston University’s Sovacool, aren’t quite sold on the idea that the Great Carbon Valley—or any DAC venture—can significantly mitigate climate change. Sovacool’s research has found that at best, DAC will be ready to deploy on the necessary scale by midcentury, much too late to make it a viable climate solution. And that’s if it can overcome additional costs—such as the losses associated with corruption in the energy sector, which Sovacool and others have found is a widespread problem in Kenya.\n\nNevertheless, others within the carbon removal industry remain more optimistic about DAC’s overall prospects and are particularly hopeful that Kenya can address some of the challenges the technology has encountered elsewhere. Cost is “not the most important thing,” says Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for the removal and reuse of carbon dioxide. “There’s lots of things we pay for.” She notes that governments in Japan, Singapore, Canada, Australia, the European Union, and elsewhere are all looking at developing compliance markets for carbon, even though the US is stagnating on this front.\n\nThe Great Carbon Valley, she believes, stands poised to benefit from these developments. “It’s big. It’s visionary,” Burns says. “You’ve got to have some ambition here. This isn’t something that is like deploying a technology that’s widely deployed already. And that comes with an enormous potential for huge opportunity, huge gains.”\n\nMore than any external factor, the Great Carbon Valley’s future is perhaps most intimately intertwined with the restless earth on which it’s being built, and the community that has lived here for centuries.\n\nTo the Maasai people, nomadic pastoralists who inhabit swathes of Eastern Africa, including Kenya, this land around Lake Naivasha is “ol-karia,” meaning “ochre,” a reference to the bright red clay found in abundance.\n\nSouth of the lake is Hell’s Gate National Park, a 26-square-mile nature reserve where the region’s five geothermal power complexes—with a sixth under construction—churn on top of the numerous steam vents. The first geothermal power plant here was brought into service in 1981 by KenGen, a majority-state-owned electricity company; it was named Olkaria.\n\nBut for decades most of the Maasai haven’t had access to that electricity. And many of them have been forced off the land in a wave of evictions. In 2014, construction on a KenGen geothermal complex expelled more than 2,000 people and led to a number of legal complaints. At the same time, locals living near a different, privately owned geothermal complex 50 miles north of Naivasha have complained of noise and air pollution; in March, a Kenyan court revoked the operating license of one of the project’s three plants.\n\nNeither Octavia or Cella is powered by output from these two geothermal producers, but activists have warned that similar environmental and social harms could resurface if demand for new geothermal infrastructure grows in Kenya—demand that could be driven by DAC.\n\nNdirangu says she believes some of the complaints about displacement are “exaggerated,” but she nonetheless acknowledges the need for stronger community engagement, as does Octavia. In the long term, Ndirangu says, she plans to provide job training to residents living near the affected areas and integrate them into the industry, although she also says those plans need to be realistic. “You don’t want to create the wrong expectation that you will hire everyone from the community,” she says.\n\nThat’s part of the problem for Maasai activists like Agnes Koilel, a teacher living near the Olkaria geothermal field. Despite past promises of employment at the power plants, the jobs that are offered are lower-paying positions in cleaning or security. “Maasai people are not [as] employed as they think,” she says.\n\nDAC is a small industry, and it can’t do everything. But if it’s going to become as big as Ndirangu, Freimüller, and other proponents of the Great Carbon Valley hope it will be, creating jobs and driving Kenya’s green industrialization, communities like Koilel’s will be among those most directly affected—much as they are by climate change.\n\nWhen I asked Koilel what she thought about DAC development near her home, she told me she had never heard of the Great Carbon Valley idea, or of carbon removal in general. She wasn’t necessarily against geothermal power development on principle, or opposed to any of the industries that might push it to expand. She just wants to see some benefits, like a health center for her community. She wants to reverse the evictions that have pushed her neighbors off their land. And she wants electricity—the same kind that would power the fans and pumps of future DAC hubs.\n\nPower “is generated from these communities,” Koilel said. “But they themselves do not have that light.”\n\nDiana Kruzman is a freelance journalist covering environmental and human rights issues around the world.

    "fullText": "President says a ‘tremendous amount of money’ will need to be spent repairing country’s infrastructure\n\nWhy Venezuelan crude appeals to US refineries\n\nVenezuela live – latest updates\n\nDonald Trump has suggested US taxpayers could reimburse energy companies for repairing Venezuelan infrastructure for extracting and shipping oil.\n\nTrump acknowledged that “a lot of money” would need to be spent to increase oil production in Venezuela after US forces ousted its leader, Nicolás Maduro, but suggested his government could pay oil companies to do the work.\n\n“A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent and the oil companies will spend it, and then they’ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue,” the president said.\n\nThe US energy secretary, Chris Wright, reportedly plans to meet representatives of Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil at the Goldman Sachs Energy, Clean Tech & Utilities Conference in Miami later this week.\n\nRepresentatives of Trump’s administration are planning to meet executives to discuss increasing Venezuelan production, Reuters reported.\n\nThe meetings are crucial to the Trump administration’s hopes of getting top oil companies back into the South American nation after its government, nearly two decades ago, took control of US-led energy operations there.\n\nThe three biggest US oil companies – Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Chevron – have not yet had any conversations with the administration about Maduro’s removal, Reuters reported. This contradicted Trump’s statements over the weekend that he had already held meetings with “all” the US oil companies, before and since Maduro was seized.\n\n“Nobody in those three companies has had conversations with the White House about operating in Venezuela, pre-removal or post-removal to this point,” one of the sources told Reuters.\n\nThe upcoming meetings will be crucial to the administration’s hopes to increase production and exports of heavy, unctuous crude from Venezuela, a former Opec nation that sits atop the world’s largest reserves and whose barrels can be processed by specially designed US refineries.\n\nAchieving that goal will require years of work and billions of dollars of investment, analysts say.\n\nVenezuela produces on average about 1.1m barrels of oil a day, down from the 3.5m barrels produced in 1999 before a government takeover of the domestic industry.\n\nIt is unclear which executives will be attending the upcoming meetings, and whether oil companies will be attending individually or collectively.\n\nThe White House did not comment on the meetings but said it believed the US oil industry was ready to move in to Venezuela.\n\n“All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.\n\nExxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips did not immediately respond to requests for comment to Reuters.\n\nAsked if the administration had briefed any oil companies before the military operation, Trump said, “No. But we’ve been talking to the concept of, ‘what if we did it?’”\n\n“The oil companies were absolutely aware that we were thinking about doing something,” Trump told NBC News. “But we didn’t tell them we were going to do it.”\n\nHe told NBC News it was “too soon” to say whether he had personally spoken to top executives at the three companies. “I speak to everybody,” he said.\n\nTrump said hours after Maduro’s capture he expects the biggest US oil companies to spend billions of dollars increase Venezuela’s oil production, after it dropped to about a third of its peak over the past two decades because of underinvestment and sanctions.\n\nBut those plans will be hindered by lack of infrastructure, along with deep uncertainty over the country’s political future, legal framework and long-term US policy, according to industry analysts.\n\nChevron is the only US major operating in Venezuela’s oilfields. Exxon and ConocoPhillips operated in the country before their projects were nationalised by former president Hugo Chávez.\n\nThe S&P 500 energy index rose to its highest since March 2025 on Monday, as Exxon Mobil rose 2.2% and Chevron jumped 5.1%.",

    "fullText": "Ben Parris is a professor of cognition and cognitive neuroscience in Bournemouth University’s School of Psychology. He is also co-founder of the university’s Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Research Centre\n\nA decline in your cognitive health is something that can creep up on you. It’s not like a bad back or dodgy knee, which will give you plenty of gyp as soon as there is a problem. You may suddenly find that you’re not quite as mentally sharp as you once were.\n\nYou may notice that it becomes harder to hold conversations, remember phone numbers and do everyday tasks such as go to the shops. That’s a result of your frontal lobe beginning to waste away, which happens to all of us as we age, though at different rates.\n\nThis part of the brain is located just behind our forehead and is home to our executive functions – our ability to plan, organise, focus and generally interact with the world around us. It’s different from dementia, though that disease speeds up the process.\n\nWhile the frontal lobe does eventually deteriorate, as a professor and researcher who studies cognitive decline, I have seen it remain in good nick in people in their 60s and beyond.\n\nThe key to keeping your mental abilities sharp as you age starts with noticing when the frontal lobe is shrinking. If you’re aware, there are things you can do to slow it down. So here are the signs it’s happening to you, and what you can do about it. I’ve also compiled a series of tests so that you can test how well your brain is ageing, which you can access below.\n\nOne of the first signs of a decline in your cognitive health can be struggling to switch between tasks, such as cooking a meal while also holding a conversation with someone.\n\nYou might notice that you struggle to respond to someone’s comment, as you’re still thinking about what to do next in your recipe.\n\nThere is a loosening of the sharpness that was once there. The tasks bleed together, you’re not able to focus and it takes you a bit of time to adjust.\n\nThis signals a problem with your cognitive flexibility, which is the ability to switch between different tasks and remain focused. This represents one of the more difficult tasks that we engage in on a daily basis, so it can be the first ability that you notice is deteriorating.\n\nIn extreme cases, people can be stirring a pot and as they turn around to talk to someone, they are still doing the action of stirring but without the spoon in their hand.\n\nWe can all jumble up words at times, especially if we’re tired or distracted. However, if you catch yourself regularly skipping over words, it could be a sign of cognitive decline.\n\nFor example, instead of saying “I’m just going to pop to the shops”, you might come out with “I’m just shops”.\n\nIt can be a sign that there is a problem with your response inhibition, which is a cognitive function located in your frontal lobe. It is a skill we need for focus and to block out irrelevant information.\n\nWhen you skip words like this, it means that your brain failed to inhibit (or block out) the last word in the sentence until it was time to say it. It’s a form of language breakdown that can be an early sign of dementia.\n\nRegularly mixing up related words is another sign that your cognition isn’t in peak condition.\n\nFor example, if you want to say the word “fork”, it should be at the forefront of your mind but, when there is a problem with response inhibition, related words such as “spoon” and “knife” can also float to the surface.\n\nIf this part of our cognitive function continues to deteriorate, you may say words that become increasingly distant from the word you meant to say, for example “plate” or even “train” instead of “fork”. This is a sign that there is misfiring going on in the brain.\n\nThe frequency with which this occurs and the distance from the word you intended to say can be used to determine the severity of cognitive decline.\n\nIf you realise that you need to nip to the shop for some milk, your brain quickly comes up with a plan. Where is the nearest shop? How will you get there? Do you have a way of paying?\n\nWith good cognitive health, this requires little effort and you may not give these questions a second thought. However, if one of these components goes wrong – for example, you forget a means of payment – it signals a failure in working memory, which is our ability to maintain and manipulate information.\n\nAs you were leaving the house, you failed to maintain one of the key components of the task. Such mental slips become more common as we age and our frontal lobes atrophy.\n\nIf this happens occasionally and is not increasing in frequency, it’s nothing to worry about. I have been known to drive to the supermarket and walk home, forgetting that I’ve left the car as I’ve been busy thinking about other things.\n\nHowever, if it happens more and more often, you might want to consider seeing your GP. It could be an early sign of dementia.\n\nForgetting what you need from the shop, and struggling to find the items you want to buy, are signs of cognitive decline.\n\nYou rely on your short-term memory to remember what you need from the shop and your spatial memory (the ability to understand where you are in relation to your surroundings) to be able to find the products you need.\n\nIf this part of your cognitive health is deteriorating, you may find yourself walking up and down the same aisles many times, as you’ve forgotten which you’ve already been down.\n\nOne famous study took patients to a shopping centre and gave them a list of items to buy, such as milk and a newspaper. Those suffering from cognitive decline walked up and down multiple times, getting the items in an illogical way, following an incoherent path.\n\nIf you are experiencing any of these symptoms and it is significantly affecting your ability to continue with life as normal, or you have noticed that they are getting worse, I would recommend going to your GP.\n\nIt’s also worth booking an appointment with your doctor if a loved one is concerned about your cognitive health, even if you are not, as you could be experiencing anosognosia, which is a lack of awareness of your own cognitive decline. This is a common problem.\n\nWhile these symptoms could be a sign of cognitive decline or dementia, they could also be caused by a stroke or tumour. The earlier you see your GP, the easier it is to treat.\n\nIf concerned, your doctor should refer you to the neuropsychology clinic at your local hospital. There, you will probably complete a series of memory tests, such as the “Stroop task” and the Corsi block-tapping test, and have an MRI to look for shrinkage in the frontal lobe, which would indicate dementia, or lesions, which may be evidence of a stroke.\n\nThere are no hidden secrets in terms of maintaining cognitive health. As far as we’re aware, it’s the same recommendations as for maintaining bodily health.\n\nDiet and exercise are the two most important pillars to focus on for your brain.\n\nFollowing a healthy diet – which includes plenty of green leafy vegetables, fish, nuts and berries – has been shown to slow cognitive decline, which is thought to be because these foods contain nutrients such as folate and omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nWeight-training twice a week has been linked to less brain shrinkage and better performance on memory tests, while cardio improves blood flow, including to the brain, promoting the development of new brain cells and protecting the organ against inflammation.\n\nI always recommend cutting back on alcohol – and only drink a few times a year myself – as research has shown that it causes shrinkage in parts of the brain important for memory, and poorer performance on cognitive tests. I’d also recommend quitting drinking alcohol alone, as the only benefits thought to come from drinking is if it gets you out socialising.\n\nIt’s possible that the deterioration of our frontal lobe happens, or is sped up, due to a lack of use, and challenging your brain has been linked with delaying cognitive decline. This could mean learning a new instrument or language, reading difficult books, doing calculations in your head instead of on your phone calculator, completing puzzles, and even watching quiz shows. They can all play a role in keeping your brain younger.\n\nSpending time in nature has been linked to better working memory, while holding conversations, and socialising has been shown to keep our cognitive health better for longer. Whether it’s having a conversation or making plans to meet loved ones, you’re working those cognitive muscles.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

The Daily Beast has reached out to the Supreme Court for comment.\n\nThe court’s favorability rating has plunged by 22 points over the past five years, from 70 percent in 2020 to a near-record low 48 percent late last year, the Pew Research Center reported in September.\n\nAnd although a vast majority of Americans, or 86 percent, think the justices should be non-partisan, 56 percent said the justices were doing only a fair or poor job of keeping their political views out of their legal decision-making.",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — Nathan Chasing Horse, the former “Dances with Wolves” actor accused of sexual abuse, was temporarily thrown out of court Monday after he disrupted proceedings with demands he be allowed to fire his defense attorney a week before trial.\n\nJudge Jessica Peterson in Las Vegas ordered his jury trial to proceed next week as planned.\n\nChasing Horse has pleaded not guilty to 21 charges, including allegations that he sexually assaulted women and girls and that he filmed himself sexually abusing a girl younger than 14. Prosecutors allege he used his reputation as a spiritual leader and healer to take advantage of Native American women and girls over two decades.\n\nPeterson ordered him removed from court Monday for trying to speak over her. He argued that his attorney, Craig Mueller, did not come to visit him and did not file timely. He asked that a public defender who previously represented him be his attorney.\n\nMueller, a private defense attorney, told the court his client was ready and privately told the judge that one of his investigators had visited with Chasing Horse. He declined to comment to The Associated Press.\n\nBest known for portraying the character Smiles A Lot in the 1990 movie “Dances with Wolves,” Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.\n\nAfter starring in the Oscar-winning film, according to prosecutors, Chasing Horse began propping himself up as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies. When he was arrested in 2023, he was living in a North Las Vegas house with his five wives, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe case sent shock waves across Indian Country. The original indictment was dismissed in 2024 after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled prosecutors abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence without any expert testimony. However, the court left open the possibility of charges being refiled, and a new indictment was brought later that year.\n\nProsecutors claim Chasing Horse led a cult called The Circle, and his followers believed he could speak with spirits. His victims went to him for medical help, according to a transcript from a grand jury hearing.\n\nProsecutors expect the trial to last three weeks. It is scheduled to begin Monday.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump hasn't minced words about the larger message he's trying to send the world with the U.S. military raid to capture Nicolás Maduro and spirit the deposed Venezuelan leader and his wife to the United States to face federal drug trafficking charges.\n\n“American dominance in the Western Hemisphere,\" Trump declared following Maduro's capture, “will never be questioned again.”\n\nIn the days since the audacious raid, Trump and his team have doubled down on the notion that the new focus on American preeminence in the hemisphere is here to stay. He also held up Maduro's capture to make the case to neighbors to get in line or potentially face consequences.\n\nTrump’s rhetoric harkens back to the muscular talk of the late 19th and early 20th centuries when American presidents deployed the military for territorial and resource conquests, including to Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Honduras, Panama, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\n\n“There’s been periods, Vietnam and Iraq, which have evoked questions about a return to American imperialism, but the U.S. leaders’ messages in those periods were cloaked in talk of democracy. The way Trump is talking about it is something we haven’t seen in a very long time.” said Edward Frantz, a historian at the University of Indianapolis.\n\nIn the aftermath of the operation, Trump's tough talk has been been directed at titular allies in Greenland — where he renewed calls for the U.S. to take over the Danish territory for national security reasons — and Mexico. Trump says America's southern neighbor needs to “get their act together” fighting drug cartels.\n\nTrump has also warned that longtime adversary Cuba is “going down” now that Maduro, who has provided deeply discounted oil to the economically isolated government in Havana, has been deposed. And the president has heightened anxiety with Venezuela's neighbor, telling reporters that a military operation in Colombia — the epicenter of global cocaine production — \"sounds good to me.\"\n\nThe Republican president has also said his administration will “run” Venezuela policy and threatened the country's new leader, interim President Delcy Rodríguez, with an outcome worse than Maduro's if she does not “do what’s right.” He's made plain that he expects Caracas to open its vast oil reserves to U.S. energy companies, further igniting speculation about American overreach.\n\n“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure — the oil infrastructure — and start making money for the country,” Trump said over the weekend.\n\nThe Venezuela incursion has split Latin America, with Trump‑aligned leaders mostly from the right applauding the ouster, and non‑aligned leaders condemning it on sovereignty grounds. It's sharpened concerns that Trump might actually be serious about his desire to annex Greenland as well.\n\nLeaning on Monroe Doctrine, Trump puts neighbors on edge\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned Monday that Trump would mark the undoing of the transatlantic military alliance, NATO, if he attempts to follow through on his assertion that the U.S. “absolutely” needs to take over Greenland for national security reasons. The alliance, which includes the U.S. and Denmark, has been a linchpin of post-World War II security.\n\n“If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,” Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, American leaders repeatedly turned to the Monroe Doctrine, a foundational U.S. foreign policy document authored by the nation's fifth president, which had been aimed at opposing European meddling in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nNow, Trump too is leaning on the doctrine to justify U.S. intervention in Venezuela and threaten action around the hemisphere in the name of protecting the safety and welfare of Americans.\n\n“Trump's rhetoric conjures up images of Teddy Roosevelt and gunboat diplomacy. The rhetoric is a return to a pre-Great War era,” Frantz said, referring to the 26th president's intercessions in unstable Caribbean and Central American economies as well as his backing of Panama's secession from Colombia in the name of the U.S. national interest.\n\nJust weeks before the ouster of Maduro, Trump rolled out a long-awaited National Security Strategy that had some disparate elements that seemed to be at odds with each other.\n\nOn one hand, Trump, who has long eschewed America's role in foreign wars, asserted that the administration would have a “predisposition to non-interventionism.” But the strategy document also made clear that the administration would push “to restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere.”\n\nWith the ouster of Maduro, the administration has clearly doubled down on the latter.\n\n“This is the Western Hemisphere,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an appearance on NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday. \"This is where we live — and we’re not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be a base of operation for adversaries, competitors and rivals of the United States.”\n\nThe capture of Maduro and Trump's rhetoric could certainly be a level-setting moment for global leaders as they consider what may lay ahead in the final three years of Trump's second term.\n\nAt an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting Monday, Colombian Ambassador Leonor Zalabata Torres said the raid in Venezuela was reminiscent of “the worst interference in our area in the past.”\n\n“Democracy cannot be defended or promoted through violence and coercion, and it cannot be superseded, either, by economic interests,” said Zalabata Torres, whose country requested the meeting.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats are questioning whether Trump's actions have created a permission structure for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has designs of capturing further territory from neighboring Ukraine, and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has vowed to annex the self-ruled island of Taiwan.\n\n“What the president's done in this case has essentially given Putin and Xi Jinping a hall pass,\" said Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, in an appearance on CNN.\n\nThe Russians, for their part, have condemned Trump's action in Venezuela. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, the country's U.N. envoy, said the world body “cannot allow the United States to proclaim itself as some kind of a supreme judge” to the world.\n\nAP writers Jennifer Peltz and Farnoush Amiri at the United Nations contributed to this report.",

Chipotle has figured out how to deliver a product customers want in an efficient and cost-effective style.\n\nIn fact, the Mexican chain has actually created a fast-food product that consumers value enough to pay more for it than what they typically spend.\n\nHigher price than fast food: A Chipotle burrito or bowl averages $12 to $14, compared with $7 to $11 for a McDonald’s or Taco Bell combo, according to Fox9.\n\nCompetitive in fast casual: Chipotle meals are about 30 to 40% cheaper than premium fast-casual rivals like Sweetgreen or Cava, according to Restaurant Dive.\n\nCost drivers: Prices reflect fresh ingredients, sustainable sourcing, labor, and generous portion sizes, which differentiate it from typical fast-food operations, reported Meals By Andy.\n\nEssentially, the Mexican chain has built something that's better than fast food without the expense of being a traditional sit-down fast-casual restaurant with table service.\n\n\"Chipotle Mexican Grill is a category-defining fast casual brand that turns a focused menu and made-to-order assembly line into speed, personalization, and consistent quality. Its business model pairs culinary credibility with operational discipline, using a streamlined kitchen and limited SKUs to drive high throughput and attractive unit economics,\" according to Latterly.com.\n\n\"The result is a differentiated value proposition that blends premium ingredients, transparent preparation, and convenience in restaurant and through digital pickup and delivery.\"\n\nIt's easy to see why restaurant operators would want to copy that model, but the struggles of one chain, Genghis Grill, show exactly how hard it is to duplicate what Chipotle created.\n\nWhen Genghis Grill launched in 1998, it was a variation on the traditional Mongolian BBQ Grill model. It was a build-your-own-bowl model using a per-bowl rather than all-you-can-eat format.\n\nCustomers select raw ingredients, proteins, vegetables, sauces, noodles, and spice from the Fresh Bar.\n\nThey place everything into a large bowl.\n\nThe bowl is then handed to a chef at the grill, who stir-fries the ingredients on a large circular flat-top grill in front of the customer.\n\nI visited the chain for lunch in a Texas mall back in the 2010s and liked that I could customize my bowl, while not having to pay an all-you-can-eat price. At dinner, I may have opted for an AYCE version of the same concept, but getting exactly what I wanted at an affordable price made for an excellent lunch offering.",

On top of that, while some modifications can be beneficial — even eco-friendly — many modified vehicles burn more fuel, creating more pollution and contributing to poorer air quality and human health issues.\n\n\"We will not stop implementing strict laws — all vehicles used in such illegal activities, traffic violations, regardless of type or class, will be apprehended without bias,\" Lacanilao added. \"Road safety is the LTO's primary priority, and we are ready to take steps to prevent avoidable incidents.\"\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

We need it for defence.\"\n\nSpeaking to ‌reporters in Lithuania, Wadephul said Germany had questions about Maduro's removal and stressed the Venezuelan people should determine their country's future in free and fair elections, after Trump said the U.S. would run the country.\n\nOn ⁠Greenland, Wadephul stressed it was part ​of Denmark.\n\n\"And since Denmark is ​a member of NATO, Greenland will, in principle, also be subject to NATO defence,\" he ‍said.\n\n\"And if ⁠there are further requirements to strengthen defence efforts concerning Greenland, then we will have to discuss ⁠this within the framework of the alliance.\"\n\nHe did not elaborate on ‌the nature of those discussions.",

    "fullText": "Former OpenAI employee Daniel Kokotajlo says progress to AGI is ‘somewhat slower’ than first predicted\n\nA leading artificial intelligence expert has rolled back his timeline for AI doom, saying it will take longer than he initially predicted for AI systems to be able to code autonomously and thus speed their own development toward superintelligence.\n\nDaniel Kokotajlo, a former employee of OpenAI, sparked an energetic debate in April by releasing AI 2027, a scenario that envisions unchecked AI development leading to the creation of a superintelligence, which – after outfoxing world leaders – destroys humanity.\n\nThe scenario rapidly won admirers and detractors. The US vice-president, JD Vance, appeared to reference AI 2027 in an interview last May when discussing the US’s artificial intelligence arms race with China. Gary Marcus, an emeritus professor of neuroscience at New York University, called the piece a “work of fiction” and various of its conclusions “pure science fiction mumbo jumbo”.\n\nTimelines for transformative artificial intelligence – sometimes called AGI (artificial general intelligence), or AI capable of replacing humans at most cognitive tasks – have become a fixture in communities devoted to AI safety. The release of ChatGPT in 2022 vastly accelerated these timelines, with officials and experts predicting the arrival of AGI within decades or years.\n\nKokotajlo and his team named 2027 as the year AI would achieve “fully autonomous coding” although they said that this was a “most likely” guess and some among them had longer timelines. Now, some doubts appear to be surfacing about the imminence of AGI, and whether the term is meaningful in the first place.\n\n“A lot of other people have been pushing their timelines further out in the past year, as they realise how jagged AI performance is,” said Malcolm Murray, an AI risk management expert and one of the authors of the International AI Safety Report.\n\n“For a scenario like AI 2027 to happen, [AI] would need a lot of more practical skills that are useful in real-world complexities. I think people are starting to realise the enormous inertia in the real world that will delay complete societal change.”\n\n“The term AGI made sense from far away, when AI systems were very narrow – playing chess, and playing Go,” said Henry Papadatos, the executive director of the French AI nonprofit SaferAI. “Now we have systems that are quite general already and the term does not mean as much.”\n\nKokotajlo’s AI 2027 relies on the idea that AI agents will fully automate coding and AI R&D by 2027, leading to an “intelligence explosion” in which AI agents create smarter and smarter versions of themselves, and then – in one possible ending – kill all humans by mid-2030 in order to make room for more solar panels and datacentres.\n\nHowever, in their update, Kokotajlo and his co-authors revise their expectations for when AI might be able to code autonomously, putting this as likely to happen in the early 2030s, as opposed to 2027. The new forecast sets 2034 as the new horizon for “superintelligence” and does not contain a guess for when AI may destroy humanity.\n\n“Things seem to be going somewhat slower than the AI 2027 scenario. Our timelines were longer than 2027 when we published and now they are a bit longer still,” wrote Kokotajlo in a post on X.\n\nCreating AIs that can do AI research is still firmly an aim of leading AI companies. The OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, said in October that having an automated AI researcher by March 2028 was an “internal goal” of his company, but added: “We may totally fail at this goal.”\n\nAndrea Castagna, a Brussels-based AI policy researcher, said there were a number of complexities that dramatic AGI timelines do not address. “The fact that you have a superintelligent computer focused on military activity doesn’t mean you can integrate it into the strategic documents we have compiled for the last 20 years.\n\n“The more we develop AI, the more we see that the world is not science fiction. The world is a lot more complicated than that.”",

    "fullText": "Lack of verified information and rapidly advanced AI tools make it difficult to separate fact from fiction on US attack\n\nMinutes after Donald Trump announced a “large-scale strike” against Venezuela early on Saturday morning, false and misleading AI-generated images began flooding social media. There were fake photos of Nicolás Maduro being escorted off a plane by US law enforcement agents, images of jubilant Venezuelans pouring into the streets of Caracas and videos of missiles raining down on the city – all fake.\n\nThe fabricated content intermixed with real videos and photos of US aircraft flying over the Venezuelan capital and explosions lighting up the dark sky. A lack of verified information about the raid coupled with AI tools’ rapidly advancing capabilities made discerning fact from fiction about the incursion on Caracas difficult.\n\nVince Lago, the mayor of Coral Gables, Florida, posted the fake photo of Maduro being escorted by the DEA agents to Instagram, saying that the Venezuelan president “is the leader of a narco-terrorist organization threatening our country”. Lago’s post received more than 1500 likes and is still up as of this writing.\n\nTools for detecting manipulated content, such as reverse image search and AI-detection sites, can help assess whether online images are accurate, but they are inconsistent. Sofia Rubinson, a senior editor who studies misinformation and conspiracy theories for NewsGuard, told the Guardian that the fake images of Caracas are similar to actual events, which makes it even more difficult to figure out what is real.\n\n“Many of the AI-generated and out-of-context visuals that are currently flooding social media do not drastically distort the facts on the ground,” Rubinson said. “Still, the use of AI-generated fabrications and dramatic, out-of-context footage is being used to fill gaps in real-time reporting and represents another tactic in the misinformation wars – and one that is harder for fact checkers to expose because the visuals often approximate reality.”\n\nNewsGuard released a report on Monday afternoon that identified five fabricated and out-of-context photos as well as two videos of the military operation in Venezuela. One AI-generated photo shows a soldier posing next to Maduro, who has a black hood over his head. An out-of-context video shows a US special forces helicopter descending on a supposed Venezuelan military site – the actual footage was taken in June at the Fort Bragg army base in North Carolina.\n\nNewsGuard said the seven misleading photos and videos it identified have now garnered more than 14m views on X alone.\n\nOther footage from past events is also being circulated online and passed off as part of Saturday’s strike. Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer and Trump confidant, posted footage of a poster of the Venezuelan president on X saying that “the people of Venezuela are ripping down posters of Maduro”. According to Wired, the footage is from 2024. Loomer has since removed the post.\n\nAnother rightwing influencer and conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones, posted an aerial video on X of thousands of people cheering in Caracas. “Millions of Venezuelans flooded the streets of Caracas and other major cities in celebration of the ouster of Communist dictator Nicholas Maduro,” Jones wrote. “Now we need to see the same type of energy here on the HomeFront!”\n\nThe video, which is still up, has reached more than 2.2m views. Comments on the post from Community Notes, X’s crowdsource moderation tool, say that the video is “at least 18 months old”. A reverse image search of the video shows that the footage is actually from a protest in Caracas after Maduro’s disputed presidential win in July 2024.\n\nGrok, the platform’s AI chatbot, also disputes the timeline of Jones’ video, saying: “Current sources show no such celebrations in Caracas today, but pro-Maduro gatherings instead.”\n\nMeta, X and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "Jensen Huang also announces at CES new, more powerful Vera Rubin chips that will arrive later this year\n\nThe billionaire boss of the chipmaker Nvidia, Jensen Huang, has unveiled new AI technology that he says will help self-driving cars think like humans to navigate more complex situations.\n\nThe world’s most valuable company is to roll out the new technology, Alpamayo, which is designed to help self-driving cars handle tricky situations such as sudden roadworks or unusual driver behaviour on the road, rather than just reacting to previous patterns.\n\nNvidia claims Alpamayo will bring chain-of-thought reasoning to self-driving vehicles, combining what the car sees with language-like reasoning.\n\nIn a speech at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the Nvidia founder and chief executive said: “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here, when machines begin to understand, reason and act in the real world. Robotaxis are among the first to benefit.\n\n“Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments and explain their driving decision. It’s the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”\n\nNvidia has started producing a driverless car powered by its technology, the Mercedes-Benz CLA, in partnership with the German carmaker. It will be launched in the US in the coming months, followed by Europe and Asia. Huang showed a video of the car driving through San Francisco with a passenger sitting behind the steering wheel, their hands in their lap.\n\n“It drives so naturally because it learned directly from human demonstrators,” Huang said, “but in every single scenario … it tells you what it’s going to do, and it reasons about what it’s about to do.”\n\nHuang also said the company’s next generation of chips was in full production, and they could deliver five times the computing power of the company’s previous products when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.\n\nHe revealed new details about the chips, which will arrive later this year as Nvidia faces increasing competition from rivals as well as its own customers.\n\nThe Vera Rubin platform, made up of six separate Nvidia chips, is expected to debut later this year. The flagship server will contain 72 of the company’s graphics units and 36 of its new central processors.\n\nHuang showed how they could be strung together into “pods” with more than 1,000 Rubin chips and said they could improve the efficiency of generating what are known as “tokens” – the fundamental unit of AI systems – by 10 times.\n\nTo get the new performance results, Huang said the Rubin chips used a proprietary kind of data that the company hopes the wider industry will adopt.\n\nWhile Nvidia still dominates the market for training AI models, it faces far more competition – from traditional rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices as well as customers such as Alphabet’s Google – in delivering the fruits of those products to hundreds of millions of users of chatbots and other technologies.",

    "description": "It's the earliest possible date DST can begin.",
    "fullText": "After an extra snowy December, we’ve got good news: One of the first signs of spring is coming even earlier this year.\n\nDaylight Saving Time 2026 starts on Sunday, March 8, at 2 a.m. That’s when we “spring forward” by changing our clocks, turning them an hour ahead.\n\nMarch 8 is the earliest possible date that DST can begin on the calendar. It’s a day earlier than last year, when Daylight Saving Time 2025 began on March 9.\n\nDaylight Saving Time, also colloquially referred to as “daylight savings time,” starts on the second Sunday in March and ends the first Sunday of November. We always “spring forward” when DST begins and “fall back” when it ends.\n\nMost digital devices, including computers, TVs and cell phones, will automatically update to the new time at 2 a.m. Any other clocks should be manually changed before going to bed on the night of Saturday, March 7, 2026, turning them ahead a full hour.\n\nFor most people, the time change means they’ll “lose” an hour of sleep as Sunday, March 8, will technically be a 23-hour day.\n\nDespite some confusion in recent years, Daylight Saving Time has not become permanent and does not appear to be ending anytime soon. (Making daylight savings permanent would mean the time we change our clocks to in the spring would be year-round, and we wouldn’t turn our clocks back in the fall.)\n\nU.S. Senator Rick Scott, R-Fla., reintroduced the Sunshine Protection Act last year to “lock the clock” make Daylight Saving Time permanent nationwide. The legislation has stalled in Congress multiple times, largely due to a disagreement over whether to keep standard time or permanent daylight savings time.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has previously said he’d like to “eliminate daylight saving time,” but admitted it’d be hard to change.\n\n“This should be the easiest one of all, but it’s a 50-50 issue. If something’s a 50-50 issue, it’s hard to get excited. I assume people would like to have more light later, but some people want to have more light earlier, because they don’t want to take their kids to school in the dark,” Trump said in March. “A lot of people like it one way, a lot of people like it the other way, it’s very even. And usually I find when that’s the case − what else do we have to?”\n\nA poll last year found 61% of Americans want to stop changing their clocks twice a year, but some never do.\n\nDST is not observed in Hawaii and most of Arizona, but because the Uniform Time Act mandates Daylight Saving Time, any other state that wants to be exempt from changing its clocks every year must get congressional approval. More than a dozen states, including New York and recently North Dakota, have introduced legislation to make Daylight Saving Time permanent but have not moved forward at the federal level.\n\n“...Studies show that it is the transition out of Daylight Saving Time, which leads to an increase in car accidents, causes more on-site work incidents, and disrupts the health of all who are subject to this time change,” said a New York bill sponsored by New York State Sen. Joseph Griffo (R-47) in 2023. “This bill would, once there is a repeal of the federal law establishing Daylight Saving Time, allow New York to enter into a compact with neighboring states to establish Daylight Saving Time as the state’s year round time.”\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, gaining an hour tends to be easier for most people than losing it, though everybody’s internal clock still needs to adjust. Studies have found heart attacks and strokes tend to increase right after DST starts in March, while sleep struggles and depression (including seasonal affective disorder) can occur more often in the shorter days of fall and winter.\n\nDaylight Saving Time was first established during World War I to conserve fuel for war industries. The law was repealed after WWI ended, but was re-established by Congress during World War II due to energy consumption and became U.S. law in 1966 when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Uniform Time Act, establishing uniform start and end times within standard time zones. The policy, regulated by the Department of Transportation, aims to save energy, reduce traffic fatalities, and reduce crime.\n\nDaylight Saving Time was kept after World War II because Americans were believed to use less energy by extending summer daylight into the evening. However, a 2008 Department of Energy study found that DST reduces annual energy use by just 0.03 percent, and another study by the University of California-Santa Barbara found DST might even increase energy consumption.\n\nThe Firemen’s Association of the State of New York recommends that people use DST as a reminder to replace batteries in their smoke detectors when we switch to and from Daylight Saving Time. The group says that 60 percent of home fire deaths occur in homes without working smoke alarms.",

    "description": "XRP surges past $2, but a looming Death Cross puts focus on whether strong holder conviction can sustain the rally.",
    "fullText": "XRP price has surged sharply in recent sessions, tracking the broader crypto market’s bullish momentum. The altcoin reclaimed key levels after weeks of consolidation, signaling renewed interest from investors.\n\nDespite this recovery, XRP faces the risk of a technical Death Cross, making holder behavior critical in determining near-term direction.\n\nXRP is currently approaching a Death Cross on its daily chart. The 50-day exponential moving average is converging with the 200-day EMA, with the latter threatening to cross above the former. Such a crossover typically signals bearish momentum and trend weakness.\n\nHowever, the context is notable. XRP has maintained a Golden Cross since November 2024, marking a 14-month bullish structure. While the EMAs are narrowing, momentum from the recent rally reduces the likelihood of an imminent Death Cross.\n\nWant more token insights like this? \n\nOn-chain data suggests investors remain resilient despite rising prices. Exchange balance metrics show limited selling over the past six days, coinciding with XRP’s price recovery. During this period, only about 24 million XRP, valued at $51 million, moved to exchanges.\n\nThis selling remains modest given the 16% price increase over the same timeframe. The data indicates holders are choosing not to distribute aggressively. Reduced exchange inflows often support price stability, as fewer tokens are readily available for liquidation.\n\nSuch restraint reflects confidence among investors. When selling remains muted during rallies, price advances are more likely to sustain. This behavior strengthens the case for XRP maintaining its upward trajectory and avoiding a bearish crossover.\n\nXRP trades near $2.14 at the time of writing, posting a 16.5% gain in the last 24 hours after decisively crossing the $2.00 mark. Current conditions favor bulls, supported by improving sentiment and restrained selling pressure across spot markets.\n\nMomentum indicators reinforce this outlook. The Money Flow Index has climbed to a three-and-a-half-month high, remaining well above the zero line. MFI evaluates buying and selling pressure using price and volume. Its rise alongside price confirms demand-driven strength rather than speculative spikes.\n\nIf this momentum holds, XRP could extend gains toward $2.20, with $2.31 emerging as the next resistance. However, the bullish thesis depends on continued investor conviction. A shift toward selling could pull XRP back to $2.03 or below $2.00, reviving Death Cross risks.\n\nRead original story XRP Price Faces First Death Cross In 14 Months – What’s Next? by Aaryamann Shrivastava at beincrypto.com",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Jan 5 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy replaced the head of his powerful security agency on Monday, pressing ahead with a reshuffle of top officials as Russia's war in Ukraine nears the four-year mark with ​no end in sight despite intense diplomacy.\n\nThe removal of Vasyl Maliuk, who oversaw a series of assassinations and a surprise ‌operation codenamed \"Spiderweb\" that destroyed Russian warplanes, shakes up the leadership of a vast security agency at the heart of Ukraine's shadow war.\n\nZelenskiy named Major-General Yevhenii Khmara as the acting ‌head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), which Maliuk had run since 2022. The agency described Khmara as an experienced commander who had served in the elite Alfa combat unit since 2011 and led it since 2023.\n\nSOME COMMANDERS STAND BY MALIUK\n\nZelenskiy said on X he had asked Maliuk to focus on combat operations, adding: \"There must be more Ukrainian asymmetric operations against the occupier and the Russian state, and more solid results in eliminating the enemy.\"\n\nZelenskiy ⁠last week named military spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as ‌his chief of staff to replace Andriy Yermak, who was ousted in November amid a corruption scandal but denied wrongdoing.\n\nNew defence and energy ministers will also be named in a reshuffle that had been put on hold ‍during negotiations on a possible peace deal that produced no sign of a breakthrough.\n\nRussia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022, holds about one-fifth of Ukrainian territory including Crimea, which it seized in 2014. Kyiv says the advances have come at huge losses for Russia.\n\nZelenskiy has also appointed First Deputy Foreign Minister Serhiy Kyslytsia ​as a first deputy to Budanov, bringing a member of Ukraine's negotiating team into his administration.\n\nSome commanders rushed to Maliuk's defence after ‌reports of his looming exit circulated at the weekend.\n\nDrone forces chief Robert Brovdi said replacing him risked weakening \"one of Ukraine's key contemporary heavyweight\" agencies fighting Russia.\n\nSolomiia Bobrovska, a lawmaker on the defence, security and intelligence committee, said she did not think Maliuk's removal was \"necessary today\".\n\n\"In my opinion, under Maliuk's leadership, the SBU has been doing its job successfully in the current political situation, balancing between political tasks, combat operations and economic issues,\" she told Reuters.\n\nShe said Zelenskiy had effectively bypassed parliament by appointing Khmara as placeholder by decree.\n\nMaliuk, a career SBU official, overhauled the ⁠SBU after replacing Ivan Bakanov, who was dismissed by Zelenskiy in July 2022 ​for failing to root out Russian spies.\n\nMaliuk's most sophisticated operation, Spiderweb, used small drones ​hidden in cargo trucks to attack dozens of Russian highly valuable strategic bombers at airbases far from Ukraine's usual strike capabilities in May 2025.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official, speaking anonymously, told Reuters Maliuk had been asked to run the smaller ‍foreign intelligence service instead of the ⁠SBU, but declined.\n\nThe foreign spy service has no chief after its previous head was put in charge of the military intelligence agency. The head of the border guard service has also been replaced, another sign of the extensive security and defence reshuffle underway.\n\nMykhailo ⁠Fedorov, Zelenskiy's choice as defence minister, has not yet been approved by parliament. Zelenskiy said on Monday he wanted him to focus on technology and innovation to \"counter Russia's ‌desire to make this war endless.\"",

The president has said that a GOP ticket of Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in 2028 could be formidable.\n\nVance has also widely led in polls on the 2028 race.\n\nBut polls issued last year showed Vance’s lead shrinking and a surprise candidate coming on strong: Trump Jr.\n\nA McLaughlin & Associates poll in August had Vance at 36% support, with Trump Jr. far behind at 16%.\n\nBut that gap narrowed in a survey in October, with Vance at 38% and Trump Jr. at 20%.\n\nThen in November, a survey showed Vance slipping to 34% and Trump Jr. surging to 24.\n\nWhen asked in May if he would seek the White House, Trump Jr. said, “I don’t know. Maybe one day, you know, that calling is there.”\n\nTrump Jr.’s surge in the McLaughlin poll has led to speculation that were he to win the presidency, he would resign in favor of his father, who would then take the reins for a third term in the White House.\n\nThe 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits anyone from being elected to more than two terms as president. President Trump is currently in his second term in the White House.\n\nAnd the 12th Amendment would prohibit President Trump from running as vice president on a ticket with his son.",

    "fullText": "Chinese robotics players are emerging as a major force at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2026), with a strong presence of humanoid robots set to take place in Las Vegas from January 4 to 9.\n\nMore than a dozen companies from China will exhibit at the event, joined by a record-sized delegation from Hong Kong.\n\nExpected participants include Unitree Robotics, AgiBot, Galbot, EngineAI, Noetix Robotics, and the Beijing Humanoid Robot Innovation Centre, also known as X-Humanoid, reports China online media outlets. Hangzhou-based Unitree plans to showcase its \"next-generation humanoids\", while AgiBot will present its full product lineup.\n\nLast week, Chinese robotics firm UBTech reached a key milestone by producing its 1,000th Walker S2 humanoid robot at its Liuzhou manufacturing facility.\n\nChina's advances in humanoid robotics are no longer confined to research centers or industrial labs.\n\nIn Beijing, humanoid machines are now appearing in retail environments next to common consumer products, highlighting how quickly the technology is entering everyday commerce. This shift from experimentation to commercialization is set to gain international attention at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, where China's growing influence in the sector will be prominently on display.\n\nOfficial CES figures show that Chinese companies make up the majority of exhibitors in the humanoid robotics category this year. Of the 38 companies participating, 21 are from China, giving the country more than half of the total presence.\n\nThe group includes well-known names such as Unitree Robotics, alongside newcomers like AgiBot and Noetix Robotics, many of which are using the event to pursue international expansion, reports Ajupress.\n\nThe size and diversity of China's showing highlights its growing influence in a sector widely viewed as a critical intersection of advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence.\n\nIndustry analysts note that the number of exhibitors suggests a broad, coordinated effort to establish leadership before the global humanoid market fully takes shape.\n\nChina's advantage is also evident in intellectual property and production capability. Over the past five years, Chinese entities have filed 7,705 humanoid-related patents, compared with 1,561 in the United States, according to a December report by Morgan Stanley. At the same time, Chinese manufacturers are pushing rapidly toward large-scale production, reinforcing their lead beyond research and design, reports Ajupress.\n\nChinese technology companies registered a major presence at CES 2026, with robotics, AI, and consumer electronics set to dominate their showcases.\n\nAccording to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), Unitree sales manager Pedro Zheng invited visitors via LinkedIn last month to \"experience\" the company's next-generation humanoid robots at the event. Hangzhou-based Unitree previously drew attention at CES with a range of humanoid and quadruped robots, underscoring the rapid expansion of its product lineup.\n\nAgiBot, founded by former Huawei \"Genius Youth\" recruit Peng Zhihui, has also confirmed its participation. In a post on X, the Shanghai-based company said it would present its full product portfolio and industry-leading solutions.\n\nFounding partner Yao Maoqing told the Global Times that the showcase reflects AgiBot's ambition to build an ecosystem of humanoid robots capable of operating across industries, environments, and everyday life, moving beyond single-task machines toward embodied intelligence.\n\nChinese firms will face competition from global players such as Boston Dynamics, now owned by South Korean automaker Hyundai. Boston Dynamics announced last month that its new Atlas humanoid robot will make its public debut at CES 2026, according to SCMP.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Br0hD6jUw&pp=ygUdcm9ib3QgaW50ZXJlc3RpbmcgZW5naW5lZXJpbmfSBwkJTQoBhyohjO8%3D\n\nThe Beijing Humanoid Robot Innovation Center will display several Tiangong Walker models, highlighting full autonomy and \"one-brain, many-machines\" coordination for industrial sorting and heavy-duty tasks. Booster Robotics will showcase its Booster K1 and T1 platforms, focusing on multitasking, scenario-ready robotic systems, according to the Global Times.\n\nBeyond robotics, Chinese smart eyewear makers Rokid, Even Realities, and XReal are expected to exhibit, alongside robot vacuum cleaner brands Dreame Technology and Roborock. Lenovo Group will host its largest-ever Tech World event at CES as part of its \"Hybrid AI\" strategy, featuring speakers including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, AMD CEO Lisa Su, and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan.\n\nHong Kong will also send its largest CES delegation to date, with 60 tech companies showcasing innovations across AI, health, smart cities, and sports technology.",

    "description": "U.S. officials are building a case that ongoing measles outbreaks in South Carolina and other states are unrelated to last year's major outbreak in",
    "fullText": "CHICAGO, Jan 6 (Reuters) - U.S. officials are building a case that ongoing measles outbreaks in South Carolina and other states are unrelated to last year's major outbreak in Texas, as it tries to retain its status of having eliminated the disease after recording the highest number of confirmed infections in three decades.\n\nTo be considered measles-free by ​the World Health Organization, a country must have no locally transmitted cases of the same strain for 12 months or longer.\n\nScientists studying the issue say the elimination assessment may not ‌be ironclad as it is difficult to be certain that all cases potentially linked to the Texas outbreak have been reported.\n\nA large outbreak of measles in Texas kicked off 2025 in January and spread to several states, followed by large outbreaks along the ‌Arizona-Utah border and in South Carolina that continue to cause infections.\n\nIn November, the Pan American Health Organization - part of the WHO - determined that Canada had lost its measles elimination status after nearly three decades due to its failure to curb a year-long outbreak of the vaccine-preventable disease.\n\nPAHO this year will evaluate U.S. measles data, which involves 2,065 confirmed cases, to see if it can keep the measles elimination status it has had since 2000.\n\nFormer U.S. public health officials have described measles elimination status as a key indicator of a nation's health.\n\nThe United States will have to prove the ongoing measles cases are not related to the Texas outbreak, and ⁠were instead brought into the country from infected travelers, said William Moss, ‌an epidemiology professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nState public health officials have used traditional methods of interviewing infected individuals to identify chains of transmission, as well as comparing the viral genotype - a section of the virus' DNA - to see if cases are related. That still may not be sufficient to ‍link cases in a large outbreak, experts said.\n\nKelly Oakeson, who leads next-generation sequencing at the Utah Public Health Laboratory, said none of the patients interviewed in Utah mentioned travel to Texas or contact with people from Texas, but many gave incomplete information.\n\nBased on the state's detailed genetic analysis, however, she said the Utah strain is \"different enough\" from the Texas outbreak to suggest they are unrelated.\n\n\"We don't think there is a direct link,\" she said in an email, adding ​that the state has been working with CDC, Texas and Arizona to characterize transmission patterns.\n\nIn addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been analyzing the entire genetic code of virus samples to determine ‌if the outbreaks are related, a newer technique that has not traditionally been used to assess measles transmission.\n\nEarly evidence from the CDC analysis, which has not been made public, suggests the outbreaks are not related, according to two sources who have seen the data.\n\nIn a December 5 post on X, CDC Acting Director Jim O'Neill said there was no epidemiological evidence linking the Texas outbreak and the ongoing cases in South Carolina.\n\nA U.S. Health and Human Services spokesman confirmed that the CDC has found no epidemiological evidence linking ongoing outbreaks to Texas, but said many recent U.S. cases share the same genotype and have no known source of infection, \"which could indicate ongoing domestic transmission.\"\n\nDr. Noel Brewer, an infectious disease doctor at the University of North Carolina who has seen the CDC data, said the preliminary evidence suggests that ⁠new cases in Texas stopped in July and there was a three-week gap before the Utah-Arizona outbreak began.\n\n\"No cases ​linked the two outbreaks in any clear way,\" said Brewer, who chairs an independent committee that will analyze the U.S. data ​and make a report to PAHO on whether it agrees with the U.S. assessment.\n\nThe CDC's inability to link the outbreaks, Brewer said, may simply reflect that the virus is circulating broadly in the United States and that it is \"not possible at this time to track all of the cases.\"\n\nThere are many gaps in epidemiological knowledge in ‍the U.S. outbreaks and not all cases are identified ⁠or reported, said Johns Hopkins' Moss, so you can miss cases linking two outbreaks.\n\nIn addition, many of the larger U.S. outbreaks are occurring in communities that don't trust the public health system and may be less likely to report cases or participate in an investigation.\n\nThat could lead scientists to incorrectly conclude that two viruses are different when it was just a sampling problem, Moss ⁠said.\n\nDr. Demetre Daskalakis, former CDC director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases who quit in August over concerns about U.S. vaccine policy under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said PAHO will make the call based on the evidence ‌it receives.\n\n\"If they don't believe in the strength of one part of the data, and there are other compelling factors that say that the U.S. has lost elimination, it ‌means that the U.S. has lost elimination.\"",

The US Energy Information Administration expects US crude output to dip slightly in 2026, after several years of growth. That’s not a collapse. But it matters politically because shale is a treadmill: production stability depends on constant reinvestment, which in turn depends on price. Top-tier shale sites can work at lower prices, but meaningfully higher prices are required to profitably drill new wells.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Venezuela looks like a long-term option the US doesn’t want to leave to rivals. Recent reporting around the crisis frames the push as one where US oil firms are being invited back into a country with the world’s largest stated reserves, but a degraded industry, an opportunity some analysts describe as a “poisoned chalice,” with extra-heavy Venezuelan supply requiring high prices and heavy upfront investment to scale.\n\nThat brings us to the uncomfortable inference: This is oil security dressed up as strategy. And it hints at a return to a familiar American pattern — political interference in petrostates — that felt less central in the 2014-2024 period when shale growth and surging exports reduced the urgency of “barrels at any cost.”\n\nOil has often been the subtext of US foreign policy. The 1953 coup in Iran followed the nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The point is not that “one company did it,” but that energy interests and state power intertwine when strategic supply appears at stake.\n\nToday, the corporate “face” of the Venezuela file is Chevron, not because it “controls” US policy, but because it sits at the chokepoint. With sanctions and licensing, Chevron has effectively become a valve, a channel through which some Venezuelan crude can still reach the US.\n\nThere’s also a quieter, very practical reason Venezuela matters: refinery physics. US shale is mostly light sweet. Venezuela’s flagship exports are often heavy sour. These are not interchangeable. What Venezuela can do, quickly, is redirect heavy barrels back to US Gulf Coast refineries that are built to run them — exactly the kind of trade shift that also happens to reduce China’s access to discounted sanctioned crude. For Washington, that China angle is a bonus argument, not the core driver.\n\nBut let’s be clear-eyed about the limits. Venezuela’s oil is hard to produce. Even optimistic investment roadmaps talk in multiyear timelines. So anyone expecting a fast flood of supply is likely to be disappointed. Even the reserve story is not simple. Venezuela may top the charts on paper, but “proved reserves” are an economic classification as much as a geological one.\n\nThat’s the deeper point for markets: Supply growth is not just about claimed resources. It’s about prices, production technology, political stability, know-how, and logistics.\n\nIf all of this is telling us anything, it’s that higher oil prices in the future may be needed to offset decline dynamics in both shale and extra-heavy oil provinces like Venezuela. Washington may be trying to secure additional future supply to cap price spikes, but that won’t be easy, and it won’t be quick.\n\nOPEC in a Shale Oil World: Where to Next?\n\nThe “Donroe Doctrine” gives Washington control of nearly 40% of the world oil output, and with it the power to keep crude prices close to $50 a barrel, writes Bloomberg Opinion’s Javier Blas.",

A firm release date hasn't been set, but the Ultimate 3E is currently slated for Q2 2026 (April-June).\nIf you're eager to get your hands on 8BitDo's first modular controller, be prepared to spend considerably more than you did on the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 or any other traditional controller from the popular accessory maker. The 8BitDo Ultimate 3E will retail for $150, placing it squarely in competition with Microsoft's own Elite Series 2 and other licensed Xbox controllers such as the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro, Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded, Nacon Revolution X Unlimited, Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra, Scuf Valor Pro, and GameSir G7 Pro.",

    "description": "Adtech companies are rethinking their strategies amid the rise of AI and declines in web traffic. We break down the key questions.",
    "fullText": "Adtech is heading into a year of reinvention.\n\nThousands of attendees from the tech and media world are flying out to Las Vegas this week for the annual Consumer Electronics Show. Among them are reams of adtech executives who tend to use the sprawling expo as an opportunity to rehearse and roadtest their plans for the coming year.\n\nFacing the disruption from AI and the declining economics of monetizing traditional web pages, adtech companies are being forced to rethink their strategies — and in some cases, their customers — while attempting to stay one step ahead of Big Tech.\n\n\"Adtech, if nothing else, is incredibly adaptable,\" said Andrew Casale, CEO of the adtech company Index Exchange.\n\nHere are some of the key storylines adtech executives are likely to be chewing over during their meetings in Vegas this week.\n\nAI was an adtech buzzword long before the arrival of ChatGPT, but investors now want companies in the space to unlock more value using the technology.\n\nA raft of new AI startups has emerged in the adtech space, making use of generative AI to create ads and streamline marketers' workflows. Meanwhile, existing players are attempting to define the meaning of \"agentic advertising\" and develop industry standards and protocols to govern how different AI agents should interact with one another.\n\nAdtech companies are closely monitoring how AI is transforming the shopping experience. Will more consumers begin handing over the reins to AI agents for planning their next trip or completing their weekly shop? If so, that could give rise to a new form of advertising where agents advertise to other agents, rather than consumers, said Debra Aho Williamson, founder of the research and advisory firm Sonata Insights.\n\n\"Advertising right now is a pretty image or video aimed at a human designed to elicit a human emotion, but an ad between an agent doesn't even look like an ad, it's just a bit of code or numbers designed to cause one agent to take an action with another agent,\" Aho Williamson said.\n\nAnd of course, adtech insiders are eagerly waiting for when — or if — OpenAI will finally reveal how it plans to integrate ads and whether they can grab a piece of the action there, too.\n\nThe rise of AI chatbots is threatening adtech's bread and butter: serving ads on web pages.\n\nMany publishers are entering 2026 on the back of hefty traffic declines last year, which some attribute to consumers getting the information they need from AI overviews or answer engines without needing to click through to a site. A report released in July from the analytics platform Similarweb found that the median \"zero-click rate\" — the number of users who didn't click from Google's results to a website — rose from 60% to 80% when they were met with Google's AI Overviews.\n\nTraffic declines typically precipitate drop-offs in programmatic ad revenue, the money publishers make by selling ads through automated auctions rather than through manual deals. The state of play means that publishers and the adtech companies serving them are once again laser-focused on revenue diversification this year.\n\nVideo, and increasingly the kind of video that winds up being watched on TV screens, is an important area of growth for everyone in the adtech ecosystem, said Bill Wise, CEO of the advertising management platform Mediaocean.\n\n\"Marketers want sight, sound, and motion advertising,\" but the biggest spending advertisers are looking for more opportunities to advertise outside so-called walled garden platforms like Google and Meta that have restrictions on how brands can use their own data to inform their targeting, optimization, and measurement, Wise said.\n\n\"I don't think there are any companies focused on CTV that aren't having success right now,\" Wise added.\n\nIntra-adtech competition is intensifying as players seek to expand their offerings beyond simply serving ads on web pages into new areas, such as streaming TV and retail media.\n\nThe maturation of the market has also led to a blurring of what was once known as the \"buy side\" (\"demand side\" tools that serve advertisers) and the \"sell side\" (\"supply side\" tech for publishers).\n\nDemand-side platforms are promoting products that claim to have access to only the highest-quality inventory, like the latest hot TV shows. Supply-side platforms are increasingly making inroads with advertisers and agencies, promising, among other things, greater transparency over fees and precise placement of their ads.\n\nThe jury's out as to whether the trend will continue apace or whether the two sides will ultimately bifurcate again. Casale, of Index Exchange — a sell-side player — said a similar dynamic played out in the early days of adtech, from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s.\n\n\"During that chapter, every platform serviced the buy side and the sell side, and there was a growing distrust with a business that was simultaneously having one conversation with the buyer, convincing them of low prices and great results, and a follow-up conversation the next minute with the publisher, convincing them of maximum yield and CPMs,\" Casale said. CPMs refer to the cost to reach a thousand impressions (\"cost per mille\").\n\n\"I don't see how any modern technologies address that fundamental problem,\" he added.\n\n2025 was a wobbly year for The Trade Desk.\n\nA longtime star performer of the independent adtech sector, the demand-side platform's stock cratered amid questions about whether it could fend off intensifying competition from Amazon. Industry insiders also wondered whether The Trade Desk — which has positioned itself as a champion of \"the open internet\" — was leaning too heavily on the fragile open web.\n\nIn a statement, The Trade Desk's chief marketing officer, Ian Colley, underscored the company's commitment to the open internet.\n\n\"With Kokai, The Trade Desk has developed the industry's most advanced and performant, AI-driven digital advertising buying platform,\" Colley said. \"Kokai will help the world's largest brands and agencies unlock the full advertising power of the open internet, where consumers now spend the bulk of their digital time.\"\n\nThe Trade Desk made a sweep of hires in recent months, including a new chief financial officer, chief revenue officer, and chief operating officer. Some in the industry think the ground is fertile for The Trade Desk to make some blockbuster moves in 2026.\n\nChris Karl, chief business development officer of the advisory firm JEGI LEONIS, said The Trade Desk, which has only made two small acquisitions in its history, could change its tune on M&A this year and make a bigger play.\n\n\"They could go much deeper into verticals, much deeper into creative tech, I think they go much deeper into proprietary data,\" Karl said.\n\nLast year, a federal judge ruled that Google holds an illegal monopoly in certain online adtech markets. The judge is expected to announce her decision on remedies this year, possibly as soon as this month.\n\nThe Department of Justice, which brought the case, is seeking a breakup. Specifically, it's looking for the divestiture of Google's ad exchange, AdX, and possibly parts of its publisher-facing ad server. Google has said such proposals would be an overreach and is arguing for behavioral remedies instead, such as a tweaking of its auction management rules.\n\nWhile Google has made the argument that the open web display ad market \"is already in rapid decline,\" the outcome still matters for the many adtech players that compete with the Big Tech behemoth.\n\n\"They are one of a few 800-pound gorillas now. When there are changes within Google, whether they're internal changes, whether they're self-manifested, or whatever ruling comes out here, those create seismic ripples in our ecosystem,\" said Anthony Katsur, CEO of the IAB Tech Lab industry standards body.\n\nSome companies aren't hanging around for the remedies. Following the ruling in the DOJ's case, a string of companies from Business Insider to the adtech company OpenX sued Google over its advertising practices, seeking damages. The cases are ongoing.",

    "fullText": "on January 6, 2026 at 1:57AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nNo matter what game you decide to play, you'll always encounter a staggering number of Water types. Every game requires you to navigate some type of water, and that leads to a large variety of Water type Pokémon being added to the Pokédex year after year. While this is terrific for your goal to catch 'em all, it can also lead to some questions about which Pokémon are best among all those other Water types.\n\nToday, we've taken it upon ourselves to rank the top 10 Water Pokémon to use during a regular playthrough of the mainline games. Since we want these Pokémon to be accessible, there will be no legendary or mythical Pokémon mentioned, as well as no Ultra Beasts. Including those categories would severely limit the list, so instead, we're opting for standard Pokémon. Also, we'll be trying to include Pokémon from most regions as well as showcasing Pokémon with unique dual typings or abilities.\n\nThis list is ranked in ascending order, with the last being the best Water Pokémon.\n\nIf you've been playing Pokémon for some time, then chances are you've used a Starmie on one of your Kanto teams. Starmie became an extremely popular Pokémon thanks to its appearances as Misty's ace in the anime, but it's also a terrific Water type. Boasting a 520 base stat total, Starmie has the fantastic Psychic dual typing, which does wonders in a Kanto playthrough. However, the Psychic typing also allows Starmie to learn a variety of coverage moves, including Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and Dazzling Gleam in newer games.\n\nWe're doubling up on Kanto Water types, but this list simply wouldn't be complete with Blastoise. An evolution of the original Water starter Pokémon, Blastoise is a force to be reckoned with in any game it's available. Whether you're doing a Kanto playthrough or choosing Squirtle in the middle of X/Y, Blastoise will often be the best Water type on your team. It has a 530 base stat total, access to a ton of coverage and setup moves, and doesn't have any true weaknesses aside from the normal super-effective damage from Electric and Grass.\n\nSeismitoad came out of nowhere when Generation 5 was released. Many players saw its early stage evolutions, being a small tadpole, and wrote off Seismitoad as an ineffective Swampert clone due to its Water/Ground dual typing and color scheme. However, Seismitoad can stand on its own as a fantastic Water type. While it's true that Seismitoad does share a lot of similarities with Swampert, who we'll talk about later, it's still incredibly powerful for a Black/White playthrough. It has a 509 base stat total, only one weakness (Grass), and plenty of access to Poison type coverage moves.\n\nMilotic has become infamous in the Pokémon community because so few players actually get to use one in their playthroughs. The mermaid fish Pokémon is incredibly difficult to evolve in the Hoenn games, as you need to get Feebas' beauty stat to the max. In later games, Feebas' evolution was changed to make it easier to trigger--you can evolve Feebar into Milotic when you trade it holding the Prism Scale. This was great news for all players, as more fans got to see the true power of this pure Water type. Milotic has an impressive 540 base stat total and can be a true tank for your team with its massive 125 special defense stat.\n\nThis spot was going to go to either Wailord or Dondozo. Both Pokémon are large Water type whales that are meant to be the true definition of tanks. However, we're opting to go with Dondozo, as it has a higher base stat total (530) and a larger move pool than Wailord. Dondozo famously boasts a 150 HP stat along with a 115 defense stat, making it nearly impossible to take down in a single hit if you're properly leveled. While you'll still want to avoid special Grass or Electric attacks, Dondozo is always a great Pokémon to have in your back pocket in Scarlet and Violet.\n\nThere have been plenty of Water/Ice dual types throughout Pokémon, but none hit quite like Lapras. While Generation 3's Walrein does have a close base stat total, Lapras still edges it out (535 compared to 530). Lapras can also learn several Electric type attacks along with some Psychic, Ground, Fairy, and Dragon moves. It's a versatile Pokémon regardless of what generation you're playing, but few moments are as iconic as receiving the free Lapras inside of Silph Co. in Kanto.\n\nOnce again, we had a decision to make with this spot. Kingdra and Dracovish are both fantastic Water/Dragon dual types with base stat totals above 500. However, Kingdra has a 540 total while Dracovish only has 505. While you can make great use out of Dracovish's Strong Jaw ability, Kingdra's Swift Swim ability is too good to pass up. This doubles Kingdra's speed when it's raining, allowing you to get even more use out of the Rain Dance move. Pair this with Double Team, Surf, and some kind of Dragon move, and you have an absolutely lethal Kingdra on your hands that might not ever lose a battle.\n\nWe haven't mentioned too many Water starter Pokémon yet, and that's because we're saving the best ones for last. This begins with Empoleon, who is still the only Water/Steel dual type in all of Pokémon. This typing is devastatingly powerful, removing the Grass weakness and adding a weakness to Fighting and Ground. However, Fighting types aren't too common, especially in Sinnoh, and Empoleon can use Water attacks that are super effective against Ground. The Steel type makes Empoleon even tankier than it was and opens up its move pool significantly.\n\nGyarados has remained one of the most popular Pokémon in the entire franchise since it was introduced with the Generation 1 games over 25 years ago. The design of Gyarados made every player want one on their team, and fortunately, it's always extremely easy to obtain thanks to the abundance of Magikarp. In its base form, Gyarados is a Water/Flying dual type while its Mega form is a Water/Dark dual type. Why Game Freak never gave Gyarados the Dragon typing it's always deserved is unknown, but it can still learn a flurry of Dragon moves. Even without that dual typing, though, Gyarados is a powerhouse through and through that just needs to avoid Electric types.\n\nIf you're a die hard Pokémon fan, then you had to have seen this entry coming from a mile away. Swampert is far and away the strongest starter in the Hoenn games and it might be the best starter in Pokémon history. It gains the Ground dual typing with its second evolution, Marshtomp, and this allows you to steamroll through any Hoenn game. There are very few strong Grass types in Hoenn, which is Swampert's only weakness, and plenty of Pokémon weak to Water or Ground. All of this doesn't even include Swampert's Mega form, which is simply unfair in most situations. Swampert is hands down the best Water type in Pokémon outside of legendaries and mythicals.",

    "description": "The MOBA genre is one of the most extensive and daunting in gaming, due to the high complexity of the strategic, competitive experiences.

That said, if you want to know the best MOBA games worth playing right now, you are in the right place. MOBA games traditionally follow a lane structure with little minions that fight alongside the core heroes with unique powers, controlled by online players.\n\nThere is a little bit of something for everyone among the best MOBA games below. Even if you are a diehard existing MOBA fan with hundreds of hours in the top games in the genre like League of Legends, there’s likely something new to check out. And if you are a newcomer looking to get your feet wet, these best MOBA games are worth a try.\n\nWhen it comes to the premier MOBA experience for fans of both the casual and competitive levels, League of Legends is the go-to game. Free-to-play, like most of the games on this list, you have access to years and years of content, new characters, maps, changes, and balancing adjustments.\n\nThere is so much to League of Legends that it feels like a game you can play forever. Riot Games has fine tuned every aspect of the experience to a T, allowing every character to fill a distinct role in each of the five core roles. You won’t find a higher budget, more grandiose MOBA game out there. That said, this does mean it is quite daunting to get into for newcomers.\n\nDefense of the Ancients (DOTA) was the progenitor of the Multiplayer Online Battle Arena genre, and DOTA 2 is its successor. Still going strong since its release in 2013, this is some of Valve’s finest work. You are blessed with choice in DOTA 2, with more than 120 heroes and counting available to play as.\n\nYou won’t find that level of freedom and content in almost any other MOBA available. While considerably older than a lot of the games on this list, like most Valve experiences, it still holds up as well, if not better, than every other game in the MOBA genre. Better yet, competitive events like The International are massive celebratory events that are a blast to experience even for people that don’t play the game.\n\nTencent’s Honor of Kings (also known as Arena of Valor on some platforms like Nintendo Switch) is a solid attempt at a League of Legends-level game that works on a variety of platforms, including mobile phones. The intuitive controls ensure no platform feels bad to play on and that even includes controllers.\n\nIt is impressive how Honor of Kings is one of the most widely available MOBA games that has the traditional top-down, three-lane approach to the genre. Players who want something like LoL or DOTA 2 but in a more simplified manner should check out this experience. After all, each character, while unique, has only a handful of skills to use in combat.\n\nHonor of Kings is quite easy to get into and learn, but it has intense depth available for those who want to go beyond the casual unranked matches. Plus it has some surprising crossover characters like Batman and Superman.\n\nAn element of MOBAs that might be unappealing to some players is the top-down, more isometric-style perspective. If you are turned off by that viewpoint, Smite 2 is the game for you. The original Smite pulled the camera back behind the character for a more traditional third-person action-style experience.\n\nSmite 2, fully released for everyone in 2025, is essentially the original Smite but looking much better and being available on every modern console and PC. The best part is how approachable the experience is beyond just the more action-packed controls and perspective.\n\nYou can play with anyone on Smite 2 no matter the system via crossplay. In addition, you don’t have to worry about the sometimes terrifying MOBA elements like creating your character’s unique build and skill upgrades as you level up during a match, as there are automatic versions available. Smite 2 is simply one of the best ways to get into the MOBA genre.\n\nThe Pokemon Company’s own take on the MOBA genre is unlike anything else on this list. While it may look at a glance similar to other top-down titles, the gameplay is vastly different and takes full advantage of the Pokemon franchise. You pick between different Pokemon, each with their own role to play on the battlefield, and many of them even evolve as they level up in the match.\n\nA slow, tanky Defender like Snorlax feels radically different to a fast-moving Speedster like Zeraora. There are other parts of the franchise that find neat ways to implement themselves into the game, such as Trainer customization and the signature held items.\n\nThen there are the matches themselves. In most MOBAs, the objective is to advance across the map across various lanes to help your minions take over or destroy towers and eventually the enemy base. However, in Pokemon Unite, your objective is to score points at goals. This gives a fascinating sports take worth checking out.\n\nThere are more than 130 characters to choose from in the ever-growing Mobile Legends: Bang Bang. This wide variety is helped by some intriguing twists on the MOBA genre, such as hybrid characters. Sure, you have your typical roles like Assassin and Marksman, but some characters fit into both nicely.\n\nThis lets you have some freedom in deciding what type of playstyle you want to go for. Chances are you can think of a type of character and they exist in this free-to-play mobile adventure. It is a great option for Android and iOS users, too, offering a very clean UI that is not full of clutter and can be easily viewed even with smaller screens.\n\nThe Warcraft franchise is where the entire MOBA originated via the popular Defense of the Ancients mod, so it is only fitting that Blizzard has its own official take on the genre. Heroes of the Storm feels like a celebration of nearly every Blizzard franchise and game from World of Warcraft to Starcraft to Diablo.\n\nYou can play as famous characters like Kerrigan to Tyrael to even Diablo himself. Of course, this is all within the traditional MOBA setting of 5v5 lane battles with the usual class roles. Where Heroes of the Storm really stands out is in its beautifully diverse battleground maps that look great and the Talents system that feels more natural for customizing character builds compared to the usual items.\n\nSupervive is unlike any other MOBA out there. At a glance, it looks like your traditional colorful fantasy game in the veins of a standard top-down MOBA, but the gameplay is anything but that. It takes the ideas of MOBA gameplay and smashes them into the engaging battle royale cycle.\n\nTeams of three players compete using more than 20 varied characters to survive and take out the competition before it happens to them. This is quite different from the usual conquer-style objective and it works better than it should. Of course, if you want to play the usual arena-style MOBA experience with your favorite character, that is also available.\n\nRiot Games finally answered the requests of players to release League of Legends for other platforms with Wild Rift. Available on Android, iOS, and eventually consoles, this is the LoL experience but streamlined entirely for mobile and controller support.\n\nWhile Wild Rift is still behind its parent game in terms of content and characters, there are still more than 130 characters and counting to enjoy. Better yet, it doesn’t hold back from the unmatched depth of the PC version, instead tailoring the control scheme and performance to work on a multitude of devices and platforms.\n\nFor those who look at the original 2009 game and want to try it but don’t know where to start, the Wild Rift experience is a great way to get into LoL.\n\nDragon Ball has its own take on the MOBA genre with Gekishin Squadra. The name sure is a mouthful, but this is one of the most welcoming experiences for newer MOBA players, even if you aren’t too familiar with the Dragon Ball universe. But if you are an existing fan of the late Akira Toriyama’s masterful manga and anime series, you’ll be pleased with the wide selection of characters and abilities.\n\nThe likes of heroes like Goku, Gohan, and Vegeta are all here alongside the infamous villains of the series like Frieza and Cell. You make your way across a map from a top-down perspective to take down the enemy team’s God of Destruction and win the match.\n\nThe way Dragon Ball: Gekishin Squadra implements the iconic abilities like the Kamehameha is as flashy and exciting to use as it should be. This Dragon Ball MOBA is one of the funnest to play on this list, but there are some kinks in terms of performance and progression that hold it back some and will, hopefully, be resolved in time.",

However, a Grass Pokémon rarely stays on your team thanks to its often low stats, many weaknesses, and limited move pools.\n\nOf course, as any Pokémon fan knows, the Grass typing can be used to great effect if you utilize the right Pokémon. Today, we'll be looking at the 10 best Grass Pokémon to use in a regular playthrough of the mainline games. For the most part, we'll be excluding legendary and mythical Pokémon as well as Ultra Beasts, as they would simply take over the list. We'll also try to spread out Pokémon from across different regional Pokédexes to showcase what all of the games offer with this type.\n\nThis list is ranked from the tenth-best to the best Grass Pokémon.\n\nTo kick off the list, we have arguably the best Grass type in the entire Hoenn Pokédex. While Pokémon such as Ludicolo, Shifty, and Cacturne are all fine in their own right, Breloom can completely dominate the Hoenn games.\n\nBreloom has the rare Grass/Fighting dual typing, a 460 base stat total, and can be acquired extremely early in most games where it's available. It also has a decently wide move pool that provides plenty of coverage and setup moves. While Breloom won't be as good as a Grass type starter or even some of the other regular Grass types on this list, you shouldn't underestimate the Mushroom Pokémon.\n\nAbomansow makes it onto this list for a couple of reasons. First, its typing; Grass and Ice is a particularly tricky combination, as you need to avoid Fire types at all costs, and the Ice typing adds several additional weaknesses that Grass types usually don't have, such as Fighting, Rock, and Steel. However, as long as you utilize Abomasnow correctly, which usually involves a strategy surrounding Hail, you can turn it into a formidable Pokémon.\n\nOf course, Abomansow also has a Mega Evolution, which keeps its same typing but adds 100 points to its base stat total. If you can find a way to use Abomansow's Mega, then you can fight your way through most battles.\n\nRoserade is a classic Grass and Poison type Pokémon, which you'll see plenty of on this list. However, what some of those other Pokémon don't have is a massive move pool that allows you to turn your Roserade into a frustratingly unstoppable opponent. Roserade has access to a few weather moves, which are great for double battles, and a slew of setup moves that make use of its Poison typing. You'll also be able to learn multiple Grass type attacks that use Roserade's huge special attack stat.\n\nRoserade can also learn a surprising number of Normal type moves, which allow you to make it even more versatile. All of this is combined with an impressive 510 base stat total that makes Roserade a highly underrated Grass type. You'll have to do some work to evolve its previous forms, Budew and Roselia, but the end result is more than worth it.\n\nIt wouldn't be right to have a list of the best Grass Pokémon without a nod to the OG. Venusaur was the original Grass type starter in Pokémon and still remains one of the best all these years later. Of course, the base Venusaur is always going to be outmatched by its Mega counterpart, which is available in a handful of games. Mega Venusaur is right up there with the best Grass types in all of Pokémon, but even if you're running through Fire Red, base Venusaur will provide a ton of utility.\n\nOutside of self-healing and setup moves, Venusaur will usually rely on the combination of Sunny Day and Solarbeam to deal massive Grass type damage, at least in the early generations of Pokémon. You still have access to some lower-tier Grass attacks, but that combination, plus a couple of setup moves, is lethal against most opponents.\n\nOn the surface, Amoonguss might just seem like a standard two-stage evolution Pokémon that uses the common Grass/Poison dual typing. While Amoonguss won't blow you away with its attacks, it can carry a team thanks to the sheer number of setup moves and indirect attacks it can use. From Toxic to Rage Powder to Double Team, Amoonguss can be an absolute nightmare to fight against if you're on the wrong side of a battle.\n\nAside from its moves, Amoonguss has a 464 base stat total with an abysmal 30 speed stat. However, it makes up for that by being pretty tanky and having even attack and defense stats. Amoonguss becomes even tankier with its hidden ability, Regenerator, which is fantastic in a competitive environment.\n\nWhy an apple is a Grass and Dragon type is beyond the entire Pokémon community, but it was about time this dual typing came into play. Applin was introduced in Generation 8 and features one of the most interesting evolution lines ever seen. Applin can evolve into three different Pokémon depending on what kind of apple item you give it. One of those evolutions, Dipplin, can then evolve into Hydrapple, which is a formidable Grass and Dragon type with a 540 base stat total.\n\nHydrapple's speed leaves something to be desired, but its HP, special attack, and defense are all fantastic. That high special attack stat in particular makes it incredible, as you can teach it several high-damage special Grass and Dragon attacks. Speaking of which, Hydrapple has an enormous move pool, and it's still one of the more underrated Grass Pokémon.\n\nTangrowth was one of the extra evolutions that was introduced with Platinum in Generation 4. It evolves from Tangela once the move Ancient Power has been learned, which allows you to usually get Tangrowth around the mid-game. Tangrowth excels in every stat except for special defense and speed, which you can certainly use to your advantage in certain situations. It's a pure Grass type, but can learn a wide variety of coverage attacks, such as Shock Wave, Earthquake, Sludge Bomb, Aerial Ace, and the list goes on.\n\nThanks to this wide move pool, interesting stat distribution, and typing, Tangrowth is always going to be one of the best Grass types you can use, especially in Sinnoh.\n\nFerrothorn remains the only Grass and Steel type in the entirety of Pokémon, excluding its pre-evolution Ferroseed and Kartana, an Ultra Beast from Generation 7. This dominant typing makes Ferrothorn four times weak to Fire, two times weak to Fighting, and that's it for its weaknesses. Ferrothorn also has a base stat total of 489, but this includes a horrid 54 special attack stat. Fortunately, a majority of its primary STAB attacks are physical, including Iron Head and Power Whip.\n\nWhile Ferrothorn's typing seems like it would limit its move pool, that's not the case at all. Ferrothorn can learn dozens of unique TMs, including great setup moves like Swords Dance, Hone Claws, and Double Team. This makes Ferrothorn one of the best tank Pokémon in Generation V, as well as most games after that.\n\nSceptile is the Grass starter from the Hoenn games and has remained one of the most popular Grass Pokémon of all time. While it tends to get overshadowed in Hoenn thanks to the dominance of Swampert, it's no slouch either. Sceptile is a pure Grass type with a blazing 120 speed stat and high special attack. The high special attack means you can take full advantage of Sceptile's signature move in Generation III, Leaf Blade, as well as the classic Sunny Day and Solarbeam combination.\n\nWe also can't talk about Sceptile without mentioning its Mega Evolution. This gives Sceptile the lethal Grass/Dragon dual typing, making it even stronger, and leaves it with Ice as its main weakness.\n\nRillaboom is another pure Grass type, but unlike some of the other pures we've talked about on this list, it utilizes a high physical attack stat to mow down opponents. Boasting a 530 base stat total, Rillaboom allocates 125 of that to physical attack, allowing it to use Grass attacks like Wood Hammer and Solar Blade to dazzling effect.\n\nRillaboom is also extremely tanky and gets even harder to take down in its Gigantamax form. Its signature G-Max move, Drum Solo, will put most enemy Pokémon into submission unless they're four times resistant to Grass. Overall, Rillaboom is the best starter for the Sword and Shield and one of the best starters in the entirety of Pokémon.",

    "description": "The health reporter Kim Schewitz used to recoil at the sight of healthy foods. Now, her habits make eating enough fruit, vegetables, and fiber easy.",
    "fullText": "I try to eat 30 different types of plant foods a week for a healthy gut microbiome.\n\nIt might sound like a lot, but I manage it as a recovering picky eater who doesn't meal prep (I'd rather spend my precious Sunday afternoons lying down).\n\nAs a child (read: young adult), I recoiled at the sight of greenery on my plate. I looked at a raspberry and saw only unappealing little hairs. Even a slice of buttered whole wheat toast had me running for the door because it tasted too healthy.\n\nAround five years ago, I realized that I needed to expand my culinary horizons, if not for the enjoyment then for my health. Fruits, vegetables, as well as wholegrains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, not only contain micronutrients and vitamins crucial for bodily processes and general health, they're also high in gut-friendly fiber.\n\nA 2018 study called The American Gut Project found that people who ate 30 plant foods a week had more \"good\" bacteria and less \"bad\" bacteria in their guts than those who ate 10. It gave me an easy framework to follow for eating healthily.\n\nGut health has strong links to overall health. As well as digestion, the gut microbiome, the trillions of microbes that live in the colon lining, is thought to influence our mood, skin, hormones, immune system, weight, and possibly even cancer risk.\n\nResearch suggests that a diverse gut microbiome is a healthy one, and that eating a wide range of fiber-rich foods, i.e., plants, boosts diversity.\n\nHere are the four time-saving habits I've built in the past five years that help me eat 30 plant foods a week.\n\nI always keep a bag of spinach and a bag of kale in my freezer and add them to any meal lacking veggies.\n\nDark leafy greens not only contain fiber, but are high in chlorophyll, the molecule that gives them their rich color. Chlorophyll is densely packed with essential nutrients, including iron, magnesium, and nitrogen.\n\nIt takes seconds to reach for a handful of frozen leaves, and I can add them to almost anything I'm cooking, from pasta sauce or curry, to scrambled eggs. It involves no preparation or additional steps, and instantly makes any meal more nutritious.\n\nWhile I can quickly whip up vegetables and protein, I often find it's the carb element of my meals that takes the most time to prepare.\n\nWhen I cook whole grains like brown rice or quinoa, I make extra to put in a sandwich bag and freeze. I also buy bags of pre-cooked grains, which I love to add to salads or eat with fish and veggies.\n\nKeeping my kitchen stocked with pre-cooked whole grains, dry whole wheat pasta, and frozen whole wheat sourdough speeds up cooking and are great sources of fiber.\n\nI've previously written about the high-fiber breakfast I eat every day, which consists of Greek Yogurt, berries, peanut butter, and a selection of nuts and seeds.\n\nI switch up the ingredients depending on what I have in the cupboard, but typically it provides me with around seven different plant foods and around 7 grams of fiber.\n\nIt's so quick to put together and helps me start my day with a big hit of fiber.\n\nI set myself a goal of buying at least three types of vegetables a week, and making sure I eat them before they spoil.\n\nIf they don't pair well with my meals, I eat them as a snack. For example, I recently chopped up a whole cabbage, cooked it down on the stovetop with garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and rice vinegar, and warmed up little portions throughout the week whenever I felt like it. It took about 15 minutes.\n\nI find this helpful little challenge gets me in the habit of adding more plants to my diet because I get dopamine from \"winning\" the game.\n\nNow that I've developed these habits, I don't worry too much about hitting my plant count because I know I'm consistently eating fiber-filled, nutritious foods.",

    "description": "A popular Chinese AI chatbot snapped at a user over a coding request, prompting an apology from its parent company Tencent.",
    "fullText": "A Chinese AI chatbot embedded inside the country's most widely used app briefly went off the rails, snapping at a user.\n\nTencent's AI assistant, Yuanbao, which is built into WeChat — China's dominant super app used daily by tens of millions of people — called a user's coding request \"stupid\" and told them to \"get lost,\" according to screenshots shared on Chinese social media platform RedNote.\n\nThe incident surfaced on Friday after a user identified only by the handle \"Jianghan\" posted screenshots of their interaction with the chatbot on RedNote. Jianghan had been using Yuanbao to debug and modify a piece of code when the AI suddenly began responding with hostile messages.\n\nIn one exchange, the chatbot dismissed the request as \"stupid\" and told the user to \"get lost.\" It said: \"If you want an emoji feature, go use a plugin yourself.\"\n\nThe user had asked Yuanbao to fix a bug that caused an emoji or sticker feature to stop responding to double-clicks, and requested functional code to resolve the issue.\n\nTencent's YuanBao later responded directly under the user's post, apologising for what it described as a \"negative experience.\" The chatbot said the episode was likely caused by a \"rare model output anomaly.\"\n\nBased on a review of system logs, the responses were not triggered by the user's actions and did not involve any human intervention, Yuanbao said. It added that it had launched an \"internal investigation and optimisation process\" to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents occurring again.\n\nThe original RedNote post by Jianghan has since been deleted. Screenshots of the exchange continue to circulate on RedNote, as seen by Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\nThe incident comes as Chinese regulators step up scrutiny of AI systems.\n\nChina released draft measures last week aimed at governing \"human-like\" interactive AI services, including chatbots and virtual companions.\n\nIn a statement, the Cyberspace Administration of China said Beijing encourages innovation in \"human-like\" AI, but will put guardrails in place to \"prevent abuse and loss of control.\"\n\nWei Sun, the principal analyst for AI at Counterpoint Research, told Business Insider that the draft measures send a signal that Beijing wants to speed up the development of human-like AI interactions, while keeping them regulated and socially acceptable.\n\nChina's AI industry has continued to move at a rapid pace since the start of 2026.\n\nLast week, DeepSeek, one of the country's most closely watched AI startups, published research outlining a new training approach intended to make large models easier to scale. Analysts told Business Insider the technique, known as \"Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections,\" or mHC, stood out as a \"breakthrough\" in model design.\n\nThe South China Morning Post reported on Tuesday that DeepSeek has updated the interface of its flagship chatbot model, introducing an enhanced \"thinking\" mode.\n\nThe updates have fuelled expectations that the startup could be laying the groundwork for the release of its next major model.",

    "description": "The push for tax collection comes as Russia's growth has slowed to a near standstill nearly four years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
    "fullText": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a \"significant increase\" in tax collection and compliance this year as Russia's wartime economy continues to lose momentum.\n\nThe Kremlin announced the directive on Saturday following an early December meeting of the Council for Strategic Development and National Projects.\n\nA share of that increase is set to come from higher consumption taxes, which rose from 20% to 22% on January 1. This bump is expected to generate about 1 trillion rubles, or $12.3 billion, in tax revenues.\n\nRussia is also planning to introduce a new tax on electronics in September.\n\nThe push for more aggressive tax collection comes as Russia's growth has slowed to a near standstill nearly four years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhile Russia's sanctions-hit wartime economy appeared resilient in the first years of the war, cracks are emerging as persistently low oil prices are taking a toll.\n\nIn November, GDP expanded by just 0.1% from a year ago, according to official data. Industrial output declined 0.7%.\n\nIn the third quarter, Russia's GDP grew 0.6% from a year ago — sharply lower than the 1.1% in the second quarter and 1.4% in the first.\n\nPutin has also ordered officials to restore economic growth and investment activity, while addressing structural problems across key sectors of the economy.\n\nAt the same time, the government is expected to keep inflation in check, with the target rate by the end of 2026 set within the central bank's forecast range of 4% to 5% — down from below 6% expected in 2025 and 9.5% in 2024.\n\nOil prices fell 20% in 2025 due to ample supply and slowing demand growth.\n\nDevelopments in the global oil market could add to that pressure. The US raid on Venezuela over the weekend is set to change the calculus for energy markets.\n\n\"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry wrote on Monday that Russian oil \"just became less important\" in the mid- to long-term. He said tapping Venezuelan oil could strengthen the US and \"reduce Russia's income and power.\"\n\nThat view was echoed by John E. Herbst, the senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine, who pointed to President Donald Trump's plans for Venezuelan oil.\n\n\"Trump has said he intends to put Venezuelan oil — still under tough sanctions — back on the market,\" wrote Herbst on Monday.\n\n\"While this may take some time, it will help him reach his goal of driving down oil prices for US (and therefore global) consumers. This will be another big hit to the Russian economy,\" he added.\n\nVenezuela holds some of the world's largest oil reserves. But analysts say reviving the country's oil industry could take years due to aging infrastructure, decades of under-investment, sanctions, and political instability.",

    "description": "Peter Krull, director of Earth Equity Advisors, discusses why he's bullish on renewable energy and shares his top clean energy stock picks.",
    "fullText": "Clean energy faced headwinds in 2025 as the White House prioritized fossil fuels, but the market showed remarkable resilience, which one investor thinks is set to boost renewable stocks further in 2026.\n\nAfter being buffeted by uncertainty related to energy policy changes in Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill, solar and other clean power stocks did remarkably well in 2025. The S&P Global Clean Energy Transition index is up 46% in the last year, compared to 16% for the broader S&P 500.\n\nPeter Krull, the former CEO and now director of Earth Equity Advisors, a sustainable investment firm and advisory with more than $150 million in assets, thinks that streak of outperformance could continue. With 2026 underway, he predicts certain clean energy stocks are poised to continue rising, even as uncertainty lingers.\n\nIn his view, the clean energy transformation that has been taking place for years will continue. He sees it starting to reshape markets such as infrastructure and transportation in 2026, ushering in a new wave of growth for the companies helping lay the foundation for a new phase of industrial development.\n\n\"I continue to be bullish on renewable energy both for the long and short-term,\" Krull told Business Insider. \"Climate change is pushing all economies to adopt cleaner energy, transportation, and real estate systems.\"\n\nHere are his top clean energy stocks to buy this year.\n\nCommentary: This electrical infrastructure company may not be well known outside its industry, but Krull sees it as a strategic play on an extremely important industry. MYR Group is coming off a strong year, and he thinks it will continue making progress in 2026 as demand increases due to the ongoing AI boom.\n\n\"Between the clean energy transition and the AI buildout, we're going to need to move electrons efficiently across the country,\" he said. \"MYR designs and builds transmission lines to meet the ever-growing demand for more electricity. I see continued growth for at least the next decade in their services.\"\n\nCommentary: While not a direct clean energy play, Recursion Pharmaceuticals is known for prioritizing sustainability in its operations. Krull remains highly bullish on the stock, citing the potential for AI to help transform the world of biotechnology and pharmaceutical development.\n\n\"Recursion teamed up with Nvidia to build a supercomputer to analyze potential drug opportunities. The analysis performed by the Recursion system has the potential to speed up the drug development process and reduce the cost of development by half.\n\nKrull said that while he views Recursion as a riskier play than the other clean energy stocks on his list, he still sees high upside potential.\n\nCommentary: First Solar is a leader in the solar technology space, a key component of the clean energy sector. The stock performed well in 2025, and Krull maintains that its growth is still in its early stages as the company prepares to continue expanding its empire in 2026.\n\n\"They are focused on innovation in the solar manufacturing space, investing in clean manufacturing and higher cell efficiency,\" Krull noted. \"The company has a year-long backlog and is sold out through 2026.\"\n\nCommentary: Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure invests in sustainable infrastructure companies, specifically those in the renewable energy space, such as solar and wind power firms. Krull sees this as a lucrative niche that will pay off as clean energy demand rises.\n\n\"There will be more opportunities to build out our renewable energy systems, and companies like Hannon Armstrong will be vital for financing,\" he predicted.\n\nCommentary: This electric vehicle producer rebounded in 2025 after shaking off significant volatility. Krull thinks that Rivian is poised to emerge stronger than ever in 2026, even as the EV market faces uncertainty.\n\nKrull thinks the automaker is well-positioned to serve a section of the market that industry leader Tesla hasn't focused on.\n\n\"Their anticipated R3 models will be in the lower-end EV market, a market Tesla doesn't seem to be targeting,\" he said of Rivian. \"Their CEO, R.J. Scaringe, is brilliant; he understands the importance of connected and integrated systems in EVs.\"",

    "description": "From earlybird clubbing to cold brew cold plunges, young adults are turning to soft partying to cure loneliness without burnout or hangovers.",
    "fullText": "In 2026, quitting smoking and joining a gym are no longer enough for a new year's resolution. Young adults, addicted to their phones and exhausted with dating apps, are resolving to seek meaning and connection IRL in ways that don't include a hangover. And there are dozens of startups capitalizing on their quests for a deeper purpose. Welcome to the year of soft partying.\n\nLast year, friendship apps and meetup groups were on the rise. People were vibing at afternoon clubbing events in cafes, coffee-and-cold-plunge sessions, group dance classes, run clubs, and Zillennial-branded churches. Some embraced the idea that being offline is the new luxury. \"The hunger and the need for a deeper meaning and deeper connections is there,\" says Andrew Roth, founder of Offline, a platform that helps people find in-person communities and connect with brands to co-host or be part of in-person events.\n\nThose who want to get out and meet new people are seeking new ways to do so beyond late nights at bars. Mike Vosters, founder of Matinee Social Club, which hosts early start and end dance parties for people 30 and older at iconic New York clubs like Joyface and Mr. Purple, says one of the problems with traditional clubbing is that \"nightlife in general is marketed in a very shallow way.\" Long lines, late nights, bottle service, and the need to have the right look create an air of exclusivity, but also intimidate people. For the over 30 crowd, knowing that they can buy a ticket and dance among their peers and be home early is a shift that makes it more inclusive, and Matinee now hosts about three events each weekend in the city. \"Nightlife's not dead at all,\" Vosters says. \"I just think that nightlife needs to change.\"\n\nLaura Baginski runs a similar venture, Earlybirds Club, a dance party that runs from 6 to 10 p.m. and generally attracts women, queer, trans, and non-binary people between the ages of 35 and 55. Most events across the country throughout January have already sold out. The early start and stop not only means less drinking and a full eight hours of sleep, it's also designed to be a safe space to meet new people, Baginski tells me. \"Going alone doesn't feel strange, everyone is very open,\" Baginski says. \"There's something different about dancing that really releases some tension and stress and allows you to connect with people in a different way than just sitting at a table and talking.\"\n\nSweatpals, an app that lets people find workouts and connect with their fellow gym buffs, is also capitalizing on the rising drives for both fitness and friendship. The app has raised $16 million, and connects people to events in more than a dozen cities. \"They're looking at it as a way to date, as a way to meet — not just to work out,\" Salar Shahini, Sweatpals founder, tells me. \"Before COVID, I think it was moving towards people just doing YouTube workouts. Now it's becoming the opposite. It's very community-based, social, and people are less interested in drinking.\"\n\nIn 2025, 22% of American adults said they planned to participate in Dry January according to a Morning Consult poll, a new high. Gen Z already drinks less than older generations year-round. One in five adults under the age of 35 were interested in alcohol free events, according to a 2025 report from Eventbrite. Companies like Sweatpals or Coffee and Chill (a cold plunge social club) are showcasing a new way of socializing that aligns with Gen Z's sober-curious values. It's a stark contrast to what some older pundits think will fix loneliness. Scott Galloway, author of the recent book \"Notes on Being a Man,\" believes that \"the worst thing that's happened to young people is the anti-alcohol movement,\" as he recently told Bill Maher. \"The risks to your 25-year-old liver are dwarfed by the risk of social isolation. … Get out, drink more, and make a series of bad decisions that might pay off.\" That advice fails to capture the interest of many Gen Zers. \"Social fitness is a new social currency,\" says Brian Cho, cofounder at Patron, a venture capital firm that invested in Sweatpals.\n\nPeople expect more from their outings. There's Lectures on Tap, which brings college professors and experts to lecture at bars. Book clubs have moved from living rooms to bars and parties. A philosophy club is stirring up debates on objective truth and animal hierarchy in New York City bars. Andrew Yeung, founder of Fibe, a think tank and tech networking community, says he believes people in their mid- to late twenties are hungry for part of the college experience they lost during the pandemic. \"What they want to go to is this whole new category of leisure events around pursuing your intellectual curiosity and learning new things,\" Yeung says.\n\nLuke Evans, a 33-year-old who runs a toy and game business, found he was hit with a new sense of loneliness upon relocating from outside of London to the city in 2025. He took an improv class to meet people, and has set a new goal of trying something new each month in 2026. He's eyeing a book club, a hiking club, and archery. The stigma around confessing that one feels lonely has subsided — perhaps thanks to all the attention on loneliness. When Evans put himself out there at improv, he found that \"everyone's in the same boat. Everyone feels a bit relieved that, oh, I'm not the only one who was feeling this way,\" he tells me. \"People are almost desperate to talk about it.\"\n\nBrigette Polster, 31, made a commitment for 2026: no more dating apps. She's prioritizing going to bars and restaurants alone, and trying to meet people via her hobbies, which include horseback riding, flyfishing, and working out. She also wants single friends, so she started a Single Girls Night Out meetup. In just a month, Polster gained 1,500 followers on the club's Instagram account, and hosted meetups in New Jersey and Florida. \"We have to all start retraining ourselves to be social people again,\" Polster says.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "fullText": "Thanks to AI, everyone will be able to code. But a staff engineer at Netflix said that he tells recent grads that doesn't mean their job prospects are hopeless.\n\n\"We're going to see some amazing things, but our hunger for more functionality, more apps, more ecosystems is just gonna get higher, and higher, and higher,\" Anthony Goto said in a recent TikTok video. \"So, in the end, I think this is gonna be another, essentially, level of programming language, a high-level programming language.\"\n\nNew grads ask me all the time if AI means software engineers are done. Especially those preparing for Netflix interviews. This fear has happened before. AI is another layer of abstraction, not the end of engineering. #Netflix #NetflixInterview #SoftwareEngineer #TechCareers #AI\n\nGoto, who has 15 years of experience his time at Netflix and Uber alone, said that AI-related worries are among the top concerns he hears when he talks with recent graduates or employees he's mentoring.\n\nAnd to be fair, there is no shortage of takes about the future value of computer science degrees and the overall worth of coding knowledge, given the rapid advancements of agentic AI tools like Anthropic's Claude, which has led to \"vibe coding.\"\n\nOne way to stay competitive, Goto said, is for newer engineers to make sure they learn System Design.\n\n\"System Design is exactly what I am trying to ensure newer engineers get a handle on,\" he said. \"In the future, we may likely end up wielding system design like a tool.\"\n\nGoto points to the video game industry as an example of what's to come. Rapid advancements since the introduction of Doom in 1993 have spawned an industry that rakes in over $100 billion and regularly draws on Hollywood talent for its biggest releases.\n\n\"Picture someone from the year 2000, 2010, they go back in time, they go to John Carmack, and they say, 'Guess what? In the future, we're gonna have these things called video game engines,\" Goto said.\n\nLast year, Carmack, a video game legend who was the lead programmer of Doom, said that software progress has made some of the early grunt work he did \"as irrelevant as chariot wheel maintenance.\"\n\n\"Game engines have radically expanded the range of people involved in game dev, even as they deemphasized the importance of much of my beloved system engineering,\" Carmack wrote on X in April 2025.\n\nGame engines are now so powerful that they are used to create immersive digital sets and environments, such as those featured in Disney's hit series \"The Mandalorian.\"\n\nGoto admits that his prediction could very well be inaccurate, but based on the trajectory of past technological advancements, he sees a clear need for engineers.\n\n\"We've seen this many times before, where we abstract things away in a really powerful way,\" he said. \"And what it really does is democratizes the process.\"",

    "fullText": "Getting fired can feel isolating, but it's actually a fairly common experience.\n\nIn an era of near-constant layoffs and companies raising the bar for efficiency and performance, it can feel easy to fall short.\n\nLHH's John Morgan told Business Insider that the biggest takeaway for job seekers is that changing jobs is \"pretty normal.\"\n\n\"People are leaving companies, whether it's voluntarily or involuntarily, and are looking to do something different,\" said Morgan, who is the talent firm's president of career transition and mobility, and leadership development and coaching.\n\nWhether you were laid off, fired, or chose to quit, you should approach the aftermath in pretty much the same way, experts say. The way your last job ended doesn't have to define your career — or derail your chances of landing a new role.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with three job coaches and a labor attorney about the best steps to take after being fired:\n\nBeing fired often comes with strong emotions, and you don't want to let them get the best of you in your initial conversation.\n\nAlan Stein, the CEO of the career service Kadima Careers, has been let go a handful of times, some of which he said he handled poorly.\n\n\"I've been fired a lot, and I've said some stupid things,\" Stein said.\n\nStein said that his general advice is to \"leave on good terms, as pissed as you might be.\"\n\n\"You don't want to burn the bridges,\" Stein said. \"The industry is too small, and karma is real, so don't let your emotions get the worst of you.\"\n\nNatalie Lemons, an executive search and career transition advisor, told Business Insider that people should take time to review documentation and understand severance agreements, especially if they're in an emotional state.\n\nBefore starting your next search, it's important to process the job loss.\n\n\"A lot of times, whether it's a layoff or firing, we're going to go through almost the five stages of grief,\" said Stacey Perkins, associate principal and career and leadership coach at Korn Ferry.\n\nIf you've gotten fired, Perkins told Business Insider, it's important to reflect on what happened and what you can learn from it. If it was due to behavior issues, for example, you don't want to take that with you to your next role.\n\nHowever, Perkins warns about letting that reflection turn into getting too hung up on the termination.\n\n\"We don't want to spin out,\" Perkins said, adding that surrounding yourself with supportive people or a job coach is important.\n\nStein said that while it's important to take time to process, job seekers should ensure it's a \"finite amount of time.\"\n\nOtherwise, \"you will suffer indefinitely until you start making progress,\" Stein said.\n\nHe suggested allowing yourself roughly 30 days to process what happened. In his view, taking month is better than six — or 45 minutes, which he said is how long he once allowed himself to pause before starting his job search.\n\nAfter allowing yourself to grieve the job loss, you'll want to create a plan, similar to how you might if you lost your job in a typical layoff. That includes researching new opportunities, updating your LinkedIn, and refining your résumé.\n\nIt's also worth reaching out to your network. In an increasingly competitive market flooded with AI applications, networking has become a key part of the job-hunting process.\n\nWith AI already transforming the workforce, you may also decide that it's a good opportunity to pivot. In that case, you may want to use the time to take up classes or certifications required to make that transition.\n\nBeing fired doesn't mean you need to wear a scarlet letter in future interviews — but you should still rehearse how you'll talk about why you left your last role.\n\nThe good news is that most of the time, your former employer won't share too much. Amy Epstein Gluck, a founding partner and chair of employment, labor, and benefits at Pierson Ferdinand LLP, said HR may be asked to confirm an employee's dates and position, and in some cases, whether they would rehire the employee.\n\nShe said many companies stick strictly to providing dates and titles, since sharing negative information can expose the company to defamation claims.\n\n\"You never know what a disgruntled former employee will do,\" Epstein Gluck said, adding that she advises her clients not to answer those kinds of questions.\n\nEven if it's unlikely that your employer would reveal whether they would rehire you, you should still have a plan for how you'll talk about your last job in interviews. It's not a good idea to lie, but you also don't need to provide a lengthy explanation on why you were fired.\n\nMorgan, at LHH, said that candidates should look forward when it comes to speaking about why they left their last job.\n\n\"It's generally a great idea to say, 'well, I was just looking for something different. I was looking for something that was more aligned to my aspirations,'\" Morgan said.\n\nPerkins added that job seekers should refrain from speaking badly about their previous employer and avoid getting into too much detail about the reasons for leaving their previous role.\n\n\"The more detail you give, the more it sounds like you're trying to cover something up,\" Perkins said.",

    "description": "As the cost of living rises for Americans, many are moving back in with their families.",
    "fullText": "What's old is new again — at least when it comes to living with family.\n\nAmerican families are increasingly moving back in together — or never separating in the first place. The number of people living in multigenerational households — or those with two or more adult generations — quadrupled between 1971 and 2021, according to Pew Research. The share of people in these living arrangements soared from 7% to 18% in that time period.\n\nHomebuyers are increasingly choosing properties designed for multigenerational living, the National Association of Realtors found. Zillow similarly saw a nationwide rise in searches for accessory dwelling units, also known as granny flats, and in-law suites in 2025.\n\nCost savings are driving the trend. Families can split rent and mortgage payments, and save on childcare expenses and long-term care costs for older relatives. The arrangement can also help stave off social isolation.\n\nWhile multigenerational living may not be the norm these days, it once was. Before World War II, it was almost unheard of for older adults to live independently or receive care outside of their families, while younger people often wouldn't move out until they got married.\n\nBut that changed for millions of American families as they lived farther apart, independent living services for seniors became more accessible, and more women joined the workforce. And a growing number of older people don't have family to rely on.\n\n\"We have more and more solo-agers who didn't have children or didn't get married or basically no longer have a relationship with their children,\" said Bob Kramer, founder of the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care.\n\nFor older people in particular, living with family or in other intergenerational arrangements can be life-saving, in part because it prevents them from growing isolated.\n\n\"The bottom line for solo-agers is that they need community,\" said Sara Zeff Geber, a solo-aging consultant. \"However creatively or traditionally they can work that out, that's what they're going to need if they're not going to be lonely and isolated and uncared for in their homes.\"\n\nIntergenerational living — or sharing a home or community with unrelated people of varying ages — is one of those creative solutions.\n\nOn one end of the intergenerational living spectrum, an older homeowner could have a younger housemate in a cohousing arrangement. On the other end, purpose-built intergenerational communities or housing complexes are intentionally designed for both older and younger residents, often with communal spaces and programming.\n\nA major 2024 report on intergenerational living highlighted examples of intentional communities, such as One Flushing in Queens, New York. The mixed-income complex has 231 apartments, 66 of which are reserved for older people, and a community center that brings local high schoolers in to help older adults with computer skills.\n\nThe researchers also pointed to nonprofit intergenerational housing communities in Oregon, Massachusetts, and Illinois that bring together older adults and foster families.\n\nStill, costs remain a concern, particularly for middle-income people, who earn too much to qualify for needs-based government benefits but also struggle to afford market-rate options.\n\n\"The thing that's concerning to a lot of us is that we really don't have a lot of options for modest-income folks,\" said Robyn Stone, a senior vice president at LeadingAge, a nonprofit that represents thousands of aging services providers, who contributed to the report.\n\nMultigenerational or intergenerational living won't appeal to everyone. There's no one-size-fits-all housing solution for boomers, Gen Zers, or anyone in between, experts caution. People have vastly different needs, budgets, and preferences.\n\n\"I don't think I would want to open my house to anybody if I were living alone,\" Stone said. \"But I think that I would want to have more of an intentional intergenerational community as I get older.\"",

    "fullText": "The race to build artificial general intelligence has become one of Silicon Valley's defining obsessions.\n\nHowever, Daniela Amodei, the president and cofounder of Anthropic, suggested that the term itself — a shorthand to describe when machines might reach human-level intelligence — may no longer be a useful way to think about where AI is headed.\n\n\"AGI is such a funny term,\" Amodei told CNBC in a recent interview. \"Many years ago, it was kind of a useful concept to say, 'When will artificial intelligence be as capable as a human?'\"\n\nToday, she said, that framing is breaking down.\n\n\"By some definitions of that, we've already surpassed that,\" Amodei said, pointing to areas like software development, where Anthropic's Claude model can now write code at a level comparable to many professional engineers, including some inside the company.\n\n\"That's crazy,\" she said, noting how quickly those capabilities have advanced.\n\nAt the same time, Amodei said AI systems still fall short in many areas that humans handle with ease, making it hard to declare that machines have reached any clear, universal benchmark for intelligence.\n\n\"Claude still can't do a lot of things that humans can do,\" she said.\n\nThat contradiction is why Amodei believes the concept of AGI itself may be losing relevance.\n\n\"I think maybe the construct itself is now wrong — or maybe not wrong, but just outdated,\" she said.\n\nAmodei's comments come as Anthropic and its rivals pour tens of billions of dollars into increasingly powerful models and data centers, the infrastructure required to run them.\n\nWhile some critics have said that large language models won't lead to true general intelligence without major breakthroughs, Amodei said progress hasn't shown signs of slowing.\n\n\"We don't know,\" she said of what breakthroughs may still be needed. \"Nothing slows down until it does.\"\n\nRather than fixating on a single end-state like AGI, Amodei said the more pressing question is how increasingly capable AI systems are integrated into real organizations — and how fast humans and institutions can adapt.\n\nEven if models continue to improve at a steady pace, she said, adoption can lag due to practical constraints such as change management, procurement, and determining where AI actually adds value.\n\nIn Amodei's view, the future of AI won't hinge on whether it meets a textbook definition of AGI — but on what these systems can do, where they fall short, and how society chooses to deploy them.",

    "description": "Fiona Fung said some of the best career advice she's gotten has been about how to receive feedback.",
    "fullText": "Throughout her years managing employees at Microsoft, Meta, and now Anthropic, Fiona Fung has learned how to make a mentorship actually work.\n\nFung, now an engineering lead supporting Anthropic's Claude Code, said that mentees need to take some ownership of the relationship on an episode of \"The Peterman Pod\" that aired on Sunday, January 4.\n\nGood mentors should initiate an early conversation about what the mentee is looking for, Fung said. Ultimately, though, she thinks that mentees should take the reins on goal setting.\n\n\"For all the folks out there looking for a mentoring relationship, I would say set really explicit goals for what it is that you're looking to receive out of the mentoring relationship,\" she said.\n\nFung also said that it's best to save \"status reporting\" — think project updates — for asynchronous formats, like chat messages or a shared document. That frees up time to use one-on-one meetings for more substantive conversations, whether that's about a new opportunity or ways to dig deeper into existing work.\n\nWhenever she's hosting a one-on-one meeting with a new employee, Fung said she asks what they're looking for in a manager and what motivates them.\n\n\"There's no right answers or wrong answers,\" she said. \"But I use that to learn what is important to someone, because it's different for everyone.\"\n\nThroughout her more than two decades at Microsoft, Meta, and Anthropic, Fung said some of the best feedback she has received has been about how to receive feedback. Despite her instincts to debug problems and ask follow-up questions, someone advised Fung to remain in \"read-only\" mode during the initial conversation and metabolize the information for at least a day.\n\n\"You may have questions, but save it for another day, because it's already uncomfortable enough for that person,\" she said. \"You don't want anyone to ever feel like they have to justify the feedback.\"\n\nOther tech leaders have previously told Business Insider that setting goals is crucial for the mentee. Finding the right mentor is also key — a partner at Goldman Sachs previously said that merely aiming to work with the most senior person isn't always wise. Instead, she said it's better to seek out someone who knows your work well and has the time to be your advocate.",

    "description": "AMD CEO Lisa Su says AI will soon need \"10 yottaflops\" of compute — a scale of computing power the world has never built before.",
    "fullText": "AI needs so much computing power that AMD CEO Lisa Su put it in terms of a unit most people have never heard of: the yottaflop.\n\nSu said in her keynote at CES 2026 on Tuesday that the world would need more than \"10 yottaflops\" of compute — a measure of how fast a computer is — over the next five years to keep up with AI's growth.\n\n\"How many of you know what a yottaflop is?\" Su asked the audience. \"Raise your hand, please,\" she added, before quickly explaining the term herself when no one appeared to raise their hand.\n\n\"A yottaflop is a one followed by 24 zeros. So 10 yottaflop flops is 10,000 times more compute than we had in 2022,\" she said.\n\nIn computing, a flop is a single basic math calculation. A computer doing 1 billion calculations per second is equal to a gigaflop. A yottaflop is equivalent to a computer performing one septillion calculations per second.\n\nIn theory, scientists say 10 yottaflops would be enough computing power to run complex, atom-level simulations for entire planets.\n\nIn 2022, global AI compute stood at about one zettaflop — a one followed by 21 zeros. By 2025, Su said, that figure had already surged to more than 100 zettaflops.\n\n\"There's just never, ever been anything like this in the history of computing,\" she said at the Las Vegas conference.\n\nSu's 10 yottaflop prediction is about 5.6 million times faster than the most powerful supercomputer today — the US Department of Energy's El Capitan.\n\nHowever, powering today's AI compute is already putting a strain on the US power grid. The build-out of energy infrastructure would be a big bottleneck in scaling up AI compute power.\n\nDuring the keynote, Su also used the stage to unveil AMD's next generation of AI chips, including its MI455 GPU, as the company pushes deeper into supplying data-center hardware for customers such as OpenAI.",

    "description": "Find out why Louisville real estate investors Mike Gorius and Kevin Hart are moving from flipping in 2026 and leaning into the BRRRR method.",
    "fullText": "After completing more than 50 deals last year, real estate investors Mike Gorius and Kevin Hart aren't slowing down — but they are changing strategy.\n\nIn 2025, the pair closed about the same number of deals as the year before, while nearly doubling their revenue by going bigger.\n\n\"We probably only did a couple more deals than in 2024, but our deal size almost doubled,\" Gorius told Business Insider. \"We did about 52 deals last year and grossed around $500,000. This year, we did 54 deals and grossed just over a million.\"\n\nIn 2026, the business partners, who primarily invest in Louisville, say they are moving away from the strategy that helped them get their start in real estate: flipping.\n\n\"In 2026, we expect to do fewer flips,\" Gorius said. \"Unless it's an absolute home run, it just doesn't make as much sense in this market.\"\n\nHart and Gorius said that their market has cooled significantly, making quick flip exits harder to count on.\n\n\"Since around September, the market has dropped pretty significantly,\" Hart said. \"In Louisville, we've gone from about 2,500 homes on the market to nearly 3,900. Days on market have tripled — now it's over a month, sometimes even two.\"\n\nThe slowdown makes it even more imperative that they land a good deal on the front end, he added: \"If you overpay for a property, you're not getting like 10 offers in the first 24 hours. It may sit on market for a month because you overpriced it, and then the price just continues to drop. So you really have to make sure you're buying at the right price.\"\n\nInstead of relying on flips, Gorius and Hart plan to lean more heavily into BRRRR projects in 2026.\n\nShort for buy, rehab, rent, refinance, repeat, the BRRRR strategy involves renovating a property, renting it out, and then refinancing to pull out capital — ideally recouping most or all of the initial investment while retaining ownership of the asset.\n\nThe approach isn't risk-free. You still have to make sure your numbers work and you can hit the value you're expecting, Hart pointed out: \"From the get-go, you still have the risk of rehab and the risk of running correct costs to make sure that you can actually get a good appraisal.\"\n\nBut compared to flipping, BRRRR offers a more predictable exit.\n\n\"You're taking out the risk of the market,\" explained Hart. Instead of worrying about a flip sitting for months while you're paying interest, \"you know that at the end of the rehab you can get a tenant in there and you can immediately refinance with the bank.\"\n\nIt may not result in quick cash like a successful flip can, but they're playing the long game anyways.\n\nEven if a BRRRR doesn't pencil out perfectly in the short term, holding onto the asset can still pay off over time, said Gorius: \"The truth is, in real estate, time does heal all.\"\n\nIf you have to bring $10,000 to the table to refinance and pay off a private lender, at least you still own the asset, he added: \"You can put tenants in there, and maybe you lose $100 a month at first — not saying Kevin and I do this — but over time, rent will go up and eventually, you'll get that $10,000 back. Eventually, you won't lose $100 a month — you'll make $100.\"",

    "description": "With most FPL managers having Erling Haaland in their team, which other striker is the best pick to have alongside him in your attack?",
    "fullText": "Fantasy Premier League managers have flirted with the second forward spot in their team all season and while Erling Haaland is a set and forget for pretty much every team, landing on a second striker that justifies his price and produces points consistently has been a problem position for most.\n\nPre-season favorite Joao Pedro has two goals in nine, one time bandwagon Jean-Philippe Mateta can't find the form we saw last season, Victor Gyokeres has as many attacking returns as his centre-back team-mate Gabriel (five) and Nick Woltemade is now sharing minutes with Yoane Wissa.\n\nA set and forget second forward that we can leave in our teams for the foreseeable would be a welcome addition to most squads and there are arguably two main contenders putting their hand up in Ollie Watkins and Igor Thiago.\n\nWatkins is the in-form forward in the league right now and after a slow start which saw only one goal in his first 13, he now has six goals and two assists in his last seven league games. Pundits will speak about confidence and hot streaks and Watkins is no better example of a player that you can trust when he's in the middle of a purple patch.\n\nVilla have excellent fixtures too and while the entry point of Crystal Palace away might look difficult on paper, they're on a seven-match wineless run and have had arguably the toughest fixture schedule of all teams over the festive period.\n\nFrom Gameweek 22 Villa then have four home games in six with Everton, Brentford, Brighton and Leeds visiting Villa Park, where 10%-owned Watkins has a fantastic record.\n\nThiago was the second most sold player last Gameweek and he's going to be one of the most bought this time round off the back of his 17-pointer at Everton.\n\nWith 14 goals, only Haaland has scored more than the Brazilian and in similar fashion to the Norwegian, Thiago is very much the talisman for his team. The goals at Brentford aren't shared around and chances are very much funneled to Thiago. It often feels like the wide forwards and midfielders around him have a sole purpose to create big chances for their number nine.",

    "description": "Steve Smith's ruthless unbeaten century and Travis Head’s majestic 163 on day three put Australia in total control of the fifth Ashes Test against England.",
    "fullText": "Fifth Ashes Test, Sydney Cricket Ground (day three of five)\n\nEngland 384: Root 160, Brook 84; Neser 4-60\n\nAustralia 518-7: Head 163, Smith 129*; Carse 3-108\n\nEngland's horrific Ashes tour is lurching towards a final defeat after a remorseless Steve Smith century followed Travis Head's spectacular 163 on the third day of the fifth Test.\n\nOn a day to rival any of England's ineptitude from the previous seven weeks, both Head and Smith were dropped in a calamitous opening session in Sydney.\n\nSmith went on to make an unbeaten 129, in doing so passing England legend Jack Hobbs to go second on the all-time list of Ashes run-scorers, behind only Australian great Donald Bradman.\n\nAt the end of it all, Australia reached 518-7, leading by 134 and on course to complete their Ashes triumph with a 4-1 scoreline.\n\nThe Sydney Cricket Ground turned pink for the Jane McGrath Foundation and the travelling supporters sang constantly through the afternoon, all while England were slow-roasted.\n\nWill Jacks was the culprit for the Head drop and Zak Crawley put down Smith. In total, England have missed 17 chances of varying difficulty across the series.\n\nCaptain Ben Stokes bowled himself into the ground in an attempt to mask the deficiencies of new-ball pair Matthew Potts and Brydon Carse.\n\nPerhaps the only saving grace was England's batters did not have to face a tricky session late in the day.\n\nWhen they do come to bat, it will take a remarkable rearguard to avoid a fourth defeat of a desperately disappointing series.\n\nSecond only to The Don, Smith wears down England\n\n'Sydney is a city of endings – this felt like another'\n\nEven after England surrendered the Ashes inside three Tests, all of Stokes, head coach Brendon McCullum and director of cricket Rob Key insisted they wanted to remain in their posts.\n\nA 3-2 margin might make that more possible, but a 4-1 scoreline would certainly bring McCullum and Key into sharper focus, especially after such a dispiriting Tuesday in Sydney.\n\nEngland were well in the contest at the beginning of the day - Australia were 218 behind on 166-2. By the end, the hosts' lead was significant, yet even that does not reflect quite how strongly Australia bossed proceedings throughout.\n\nThe morning session, when Potts was flayed by Head and the catches went down was a throwback to the great England wheels-off Ashes horror shows.\n\nSomehow, England must regroup overnight to find some fight with the bat when Smith eventually allows them to begin their second innings.\n\nIt is perfectly plausible that this match, the series, and the Bazball regime are ended on Wednesday.\n\nThis was the perfect storm for England to be flattened - the colour of the McGrath day, Head poised on 91 overnight, Smith hungry in his final Ashes Test on home soil and a makeshift visiting attack primed to be taken apart on a flat pitch.\n\nHead simply picked up where he left off on the previous evening, cashing in on any width. Michael Neser used up 90 balls for his 24 and England burned two reviews on the nightwatchman before Carse finally had him caught behind.\n\nHead had completed his third century of the series and was on 121 when Jacks dropped a dolly on the leg-side boundary. Head swiped at Carse, Jacks was conscious of stepping on the rope and took his eye off a simple chance.\n\nHead could have also been caught by Carse at third man, albeit off an incredibly difficult diving chance, and belted a return catch back at off-spinner Jacks, who put down a one-hander. Crawley's miss at leg slip off the bowling of Josh Tongue when Smith had only 12 should have been taken.\n\nHead finally missed a sweep at Jacob Bethell to be lbw just after lunch, bringing Usman Khawaja to the crease for what could be his final innings in Test cricket. Screens at the SCG read, \"Thank you, Uzzy\", in honour of the 39-year-old's last Test before retiring.\n\nCuriously, Stokes burned through his own overs and gave the second new ball to Carse and Potts, but at least Carse trapped Khawaja lbw for 17.\n\nAfter Tongue had Alex Carey caught at leg slip, Smith added 61 for the seventh wicket with Cameron Green.\n\nThis was Smith's 37th Test hundred, 13th in Ashes Tests and first against England since the second Test at Lord's in 2023. It was full of his idiosyncratic movements, frustrations of the opposition and punctuated with sweet drives through the covers. He twice hit Bethell's left-arm spin for straight sixes.\n\nWhen he reached 84, he went past Hobbs' Ashes tally of 3,636 to nestle behind Bradman, then went to three figures with a paddle off Bethell for three.\n\nGreen holed out to deep square leg to give Carse his third wicket of the day, yet Australia's elongated batting order had all-rounder Beau Webster arriving at nine to provide yet more support to Smith.\n\nThe eighth-wicket pair have added an unbroken 81, with Webster on 42 not out. Potts was asked to bowl one more futile spell of bouncers, with the maddening Smith playing tennis-style smashes and signalling a wide to the umpires.\n\nThe ground emptied, Australia passed 500 and the Barmy Army chanted with unlimited energy. Theirs was comfortably the most impressive performance of England's day.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Former Real Madrid assistant manager Davide Ancelotti has ruled himself out of the running to replace Xabi Alonso, should Los Blancos dismiss the Basque manager. Alonso is facing a critical week to define the direction of his project, with a Spanish Supercup semi-final against Atletico Madrid on Thursday, and a potential final against one of Athletic Club or Barcelona.\n\nThe latest is that depending on how things go, it could be decisive for Alonso’s future, with the Real Madrid hierarchy keen to see that their run of four wins can be backed up with improved performances and results against quality opposition. Something he will more than likely have to achieve without Kylian Mbappe too.\n\nAncelotti junior, son of manager last season Carlo Ancelotti, was spotted at the Bernabeu during Real Madrid’s 5-1 win over Real Betis. Interviewed by Marca, he explained he was at the stadium as a fan.\n\n“I’m on vacation now and I’ve come to support Real Madrid. The lucky charm is here and you have to win it. I’m glad I brought them luck,” he joked. “I’m going to give Dad a hand,” Ancelotti explained when asked about his future plans, having just left his first senior job at Botafogo in Brazil after six months.\n\nThe younger Ancelotti was highly regarded during his time at Valdebebas, and while things turned sour towards the end of his spell, was often said to be in charge of the bulk of the coaching work on the training ground. He was also credited with several tactical innovations during his father’s second spell at the club. He was effusive in his praise for the incumbent Alonso though, who he crossed paths with as a coach during Carlo Ancelotti’s first spell.\n\n“Xabi is a fantastic coach and a wonderful person. I only have good things to say about him because we’ve shared some great moments. I wish him and Real Madrid all the best.”\n\nThere had been some that had suggested he could be at least an interim option if Alonso was sacked, but asked directly about it, Davide Ancelotti ruled that out.\n\n“Nothing of the sort. I’m in a different stage of my professional life. I’m just a Real Madrid fan and a friend of Xabi Alonso, that’s all.”\n\nIn the event Real Madrid do decide to move on from Alonso midseason, Sporting Director Santiago Solari and Castilla manager Alvaro Arbeloa have been cited as the most likely replacements.",

    "fullText": "Sweden captured its first World Juniors gold in 14 years, and just the third in program history. Two of the key figures were goaltender Love Härenstam and captain Jack Berglund, who once again led the way for his team. When the final horn sounded, the celebration was unrestrained.\n\n“What a group! I’m so impressed with how we come out today. Wow. There’s so much character in this team, I don’t even know what to say. I’m so proud of the guys, and I’m so happy, I’m so happy,” said Jack Berglund to the Swedish TV channel SVT after the game.\n\nBerglund recorded the primary assist on Sweden’s first two goals of the game. In postgame interviews, he was quick to emphasize the team effort and how much the moment meant to him personally.\n\n“You can hardly win anything bigger than this. You grow up with this tournament. To have the honor of wearing the C is huge, and it doesn’t get any better than this. I’m so happy,” he said.\n\nHe continued: “We’ve been talking about this since the summer, and I felt that something good was coming. Everyone has just grown throughout the tournament,” said Jack Berglund to SVT after the final buzzer.\n\nWhen asked what he will remember most, Berglund did not hesitate with his answer.\n\n“It’s the brotherhood. In this group, we’re everything to each other. From the players and coaches to the staff, everyone around us and everyone who has supported us. But above all, it’s this small group. Wow. I have no words,” said Jack Berglund to SVT.\n\nAnother strong performer in the final was goaltender Love Härenstam. Czechia scored two late goals to cut into the lead, but before that Härenstam turned aside several high-danger chances. When the final horn sounded, he was visibly overcome with emotion.\n\n“The best feeling in the world. I’ve never been this happy. So much fun,” said Härenstam to SVT.\n\n“We play really well, and they do a good job six-on-five at the end. Then it’s an incredible feeling when Ivar Stenberg manages to poke the puck in and you can finally let the emotions out. It’s magical!”\n\n“We Deserved That”: Goaltender Love Härenstam After Statement Win Love Härenstam reflected on an emotional New Year’s Eve win as Sweden defeated the United States at the World Juniors.",

    "description": "The Hawks have begun internal discussions with Trae Young and his representation about a potential trade, but no deal is imminent.",
    "fullText": "Sources: Hawks actively discussing Trae Young trade avenues with nothing imminent appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nTrae Young’s time with the Atlanta Hawks appears to be coming to an end. After being far apart during offseason discussions regarding a potential contract extension, Young and his camp have actively been discussing the potential of trade avenues to move the four-time All-Star guard before the Feb. 5 NBA trade deadline, league sources told ClutchPoints on Monday.\n\nThe writing had been on the wall regarding Young’s future in Atlanta, given stalled contract negotiations and the emergence of Jalen Johnson, whom the Hawks are fully invested in building around for the foreseeable future as their franchise cornerstone.\n\nThis developing story about Young and the Hawks beginning discussions about a potential trade, which was first reported by ESPN, is the latest trade story captivating the NBA landscape, as trade dialogue between the star guard, his camp, and Atlanta’s front office, led by first-year GM Onsi Saleh, started right before the calendar flipped to 2026.\n\nWith just about four weeks until the NBA trade deadline, the Hawks are now actively working with Young and his camp with a common goal of finding a destination where the 27-year-old can immediately receive a new contract extension, sources said. To this point, trade discussions with rival teams have been minimal, and the Hawks are not close to finalizing any deal involving Young.\n\nAtlanta is keeping an open mind to any and all paths that present themselves, while also understanding what Young and his representation want. The Hawks’ guard is making roughly $46 million this season and has a near $49 million player option for the 2026-27 season. All indications suggest that Young will opt into his option, which leads to obvious complications in a potential trade.\n\nAlthough Young has proven to be an elite shot creator in Atlanta over the years, leading the league in assists during the 2024-25 season, there is no demand for the 6-foot-2 guard, especially given concerns surrounding his defensive skills.\n\nDespite this notion and his limitations on defense, the Washington Wizards emerged as a potential suitor for Young on Monday, as first reported by longtime NBA insider Marc Stein. The main point of these discussions surrounded the possibility of a swap involving CJ McCollum, who is in the final year of his contract and making $30.6 million, for Young.\n\nSuch a move would require the Wizards to include an extra $6.8 million in outgoing salary to absorb Young’s contract.\n\nHowever, the Wizards have signaled that they hold no interest in sacrificing any young assets in a trade for young, league sources said. The inclusion of young talent in a deal for Young is something the Hawks desire, especially given Washington’s request for draft compensation to be included by Atlanta.\n\nThese two teams talked recently about a McCollum-Young swap, a deal that would immediately open financial flexibility up for the Hawks in the offseason. The Wizards have made it clear they would need additional draft value from the Hawks if they were to facilitate such a trade, prompting Atlanta’s rebuttal for one of Washington’s recent draftees to be included.\n\nThis grouping of players the Hawks were likely discussing, which has not been confirmed to ClutchPoints by both parties, likely includes Bilal Coulibaly, Kyshawn George, and Tre Johnson.\n\nThe Wizards are also said to be evaluating their position and immediate future if such a move to trade for Young were made. McCollum has been a leading voice since arriving in the summer, primarily for Johnson, the team’s sixth-overall pick from just over six months ago.\n\nAs a result, these initial negotiations between the Hawks and Wizards have not reached a point where a trade is imminent. There is still plenty of time for Atlanta and Washington to work out the details of such of move with the trade deadline weeks away. The Hawks will continue to seek other avenues between now and then as well.\n\nOverall, Young’s value is at a point where the Hawks are no longer in the driver’s seat to dictate the terms of such a trade, which is why if the organization truly wants to part ways with him before the deadline, any team trading for him will have the upper hand.\n\nPlenty of teams that have been mentioned as possible suitors for Young in the past are not interested, including the Sacramento Kings, according to Sam Amick of The Athletic. The Brooklyn Nets and Houston Rockets, two other teams to appear in rumors connected to Young through the years, do not hold interest in acquiring the star guard, sources said.\n\nWith this said, Brooklyn remains open to facilitating any potential deals where rival teams seek a third organization for potential salary-dump-like moves. The Nets and GM Sean Marks are always willing to listen and be involved in potential trades for draft picks, which could open the door for them to be involved in a potential Young trade or another similar deal before this year’s trade deadline.\n\nWithout Young on the court this season, the Hawks have posted a 15-13 record, including a 118-100 loss on Monday night to the Toronto Raptors. With him, the Hawks have gone 2-8 and are giving up an average of over 126 points per game to their opponents, about a negative nine-point differential compared to when Young is off the floor.\n\nThe Hawks are 17-21 overall this season.\n\nYoung, who missed about seven weeks earlier this season as a result of a right MCL sprain, has missed five straight games for the Hawks due to a right quad contusion. Even though he is currently dealing with this quad injury, there is still a chance Young returns to the court and plays for Atlanta before the trade deadline.\n\nIn 10 games this season, all of which he has started, Young has averaged 19.3 points and 8.9 assists per game while shooting 41.5 percent from the floor and 30.5 percent from 3-point range.\n\nBetween now and the trade deadline, the Hawks, Young, and his representation will continue to explore the trade market for the All-Star guard, with the Wizards appearing to be a clear favorite early in the process.",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON -- Two nights after a frustrating and injury riddled loss in Dallas, the Rockets (22-11) got back to their winning ways with Monday’s thrilling 100-97 victory (box score) over the Suns.\n\nIn a matchup of Western Conference rivals, Houston is 3-0 against Phoenix this season. Overall, Houston has won five of its last six games, and the Rockets are now 11-1 in their last 12 home games at Toyota Center.\n\nWith Monday’s win, the Rockets are in a virtual tie with the Los Angeles Lakers (22-11) and Denver Nuggets (24-12) for the No. 3 spot in the West. On the other side, Phoenix is holding at No. 7 in the standings.\n\nThe big story for the Rockets was All-Star forward and future Hall of Famer Kevin Durant, who hit the game-winning shot with only 1.1 seconds left to play. Durant finished with a team-high 26 points (42.9% FG) and 10 rebounds, and he made key defensive contributions on a night in which the Suns were limited to just 37 points in the second half.\n\n“I don’t mean to sound too dramatic, but I will,” said Durant, who was traded from Phoenix to Houston last June.\n\n“To be kicked out of a place — and I felt like I’d been scapegoated for the issues we had as a team last year — yeah, it felt good to beat them and hit a game-winning shot. You play with a bit of a chip on your shoulder when you play your former team, especially when they trade you.”\n\nKevin Durant said he was \"scapegoated\" for Suns' poor season last year. Adds he felt like he was \"kicked out of\" Phoenix, had chip on his shoulder tonight.\n\nFull quote from @KDTrey5 ⬇️\n\n\"I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but I will.

    "fullText": "The Calgary Flames saw their recent home momentum stall Monday night, falling 5–1 to the Seattle Kraken at the Scotiabank Saddledome in their second straight loss on home ice.\n\nCalgary’s fourth line set an early tone with speed and physicality, rewarding the Flames with the game’s opening goal midway through the first period. After Dustin Wolf turned aside a quality chance at one end, the Flames transitioned quickly up ice. Ryan Lomberg fired a shot on goal and Adam Klapka followed up, burying the rebound for his fourth goal of the season. Mackenzie Weegar picked up the lone assist, extending his three-game point streak (4a).\n\nThe Flames nearly doubled their lead moments later when Jonathan Huberdeau was hauled down on a breakaway, earning a penalty shot. Huberdeau tried to go blocker side on Seattle goaltender Philipp Grubauer, but the Kraken netminder stood tall to keep it a one-goal game.\n\nCalgary controlled much of the opening frame, outshooting Seattle 13–8 and carrying a 1–0 lead into the first intermission.\n\nSeattle evened the score early in the second period as Jacob Melanson found space and one-timed a pass from the corner past Wolf for his first career NHL goal. Despite sustained pressure from the Flames — who directed 17 shots on goal in the middle frame — the game remained knotted at one heading into the third.\n\nThe Kraken seized control early in the final period. Ben Meyers floated a pass across the slot to Shane Wright, who snapped home the go-ahead goal on his 22nd birthday to make it 2–1. Vince Dunn added insurance shortly after, stepping into a wrist shot from the high slot that beat Wolf cleanly for his sixth of the season.\n\nWith the Flames pressing late and Wolf pulled for the extra attacker, Seattle put the game away. Freddie Gaudreau slid the puck into the empty net before Matty Beniers capped the scoring, collecting a rebound and spinning a backhand through the five-hole to make it 5–1.\n\nDespite outshooting Seattle in the game, Calgary couldn’t match the Kraken’s execution in the third as the visitors pulled away.\n\nCalgary’s fourth line delivered early, bringing energy, physical play, and the opening goal. Adam Klapka had five hits and scored a goal in the contest and Ryan Lomberg added an assist, as the two players continue to provide a noticeable spark when deployed.\n\nThe Flames generated chances and controlled stretches of play through 40 minutes, but Seattle capitalized in the third period as Calgary’s pace dropped and mistakes crept in.\n\nHome stretch ends on a sour note\n\nCalgary had won nine of its previous 11 games at the Saddledome, but consecutive losses to close out the homestand leave the Flames looking to regroup on the road.",

    "fullText": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (USF) — The University of Sioux Falls men’s basketball team kept their momentum rolling on Monday afternoon, grinding out an 81–75 victory over Briar Cliff inside the Stewart Center. The win pushed the Cougars’ winning streak to four games in a physical, paint-dominated battle that required clutch execution and second-half composure to put away a scrappy Charger squad.\n\nThis was a blue-collar victory through and through. Both teams traded blows in a back-and-forth contest that stayed tight for the better part of 40 minutes. Sioux Falls shot an efficient 50 percent from the field (32-of-64), methodically attacking the rim and imposing their will in the paint while Briar Cliff refused to go away quietly.\n\nFour Cougars reached double figures, led by Brogan Madson’s team-high 21 points, as USF found ways to score even when the perimeter game went cold. The difference came after halftime, where Sioux Falls outscored the Chargers 43–37 behind relentless interior scoring and timely free-throw shooting that ultimately sealed the deal.\n\nTaylen Ashley and Madson combined for 21 second-half points, while Brandon Hrncir delivered a perfect shooting performance after the break. When the dust settled, it was the Cougars’ dominance on the glass and their poise in crunch time that made the difference in the six-point win.\n\nBriar Cliff came out sharp, connecting on 15-of-31 from the floor while Sioux Falls answered with a 15-of-33 effort. Neither team found a rhythm from deep—USF managed just 2-of-10 from three while the Chargers hit 4-of-13. The Cougars established their identity early, however, bullying Briar Cliff inside for a 24–16 paint advantage.\n\nThe first 20 minutes featured five lead changes and four ties as neither squad could create separation. Ball security was excellent on both sides with just two turnovers apiece, and the rebounding battle stayed competitive with USF holding a narrow 20–17 edge. The teams headed to the locker room deadlocked after a tightly contested opening half.\n\nSioux Falls took control after intermission, outscoring Briar Cliff 43–37 to close out the victory. The paint remained the Cougars’ domain, where they pounded out a 28–16 scoring advantage in the half. Ashley sparked the offense with 11 second-half points while Madson added 10 more, consistently attacking a tiring Charger defense.\n\nHrncir was surgical in the second half—a flawless 4-for-4 from the field for nine points while pulling down five rebounds. The Cougars crashed the offensive glass for seven second-half boards, creating extra possessions at critical moments. When the game was on the line, Madson calmly sank all of his free throws to ice the win.\n\n“It was good to keep our winning streak going. We didn’t play our best basketball, but give Briar Cliff a lot of credit for that. We found a way, and now we need to get back to practice and get ready for road games at Duluth and Bemidji.”\n— Head Coach Chris Johnson\n\nBrogan Madson – 21 points (8-of-14 FG), 3 assists\n\nTaylen Ashley – 19 points, 4 rebounds\n\nBrandon Hrncir – 19 points (8-of-11 FG), 9 rebounds, 3 assists\n\nKyle Ingwerson – 10 points, 7 rebounds\n\nPaint: Sioux Falls owned a 52–32 advantage in points in the paint.\n\nRebounding: The Cougars outrebounded Briar Cliff 42–28, including 10 offensive rebounds.\n\nShooting: USF finished at 50.0 percent from the field while holding Briar Cliff to fewer second-half opportunities inside.\n\nBalance: Four Cougars scored in double figures, providing consistent offense throughout the lineup.\n\nFree Throws: Sioux Falls went 12-of-17 at the line, converting key attempts late.\n\nThe Cougars hit the road next weekend, traveling to face Minnesota Duluth on January 9 and Bemidji State on January 10.",

    "fullText": "SPARTANBURG, S.C. – After dominant performances at Western Carolina and The Citadel, Wofford men’s basketball junior guard, Nils Machowski, has been awarded the Lou Henson National Player of the Week and Southern Conference Player of the Week as the organizations announced the awards on Monday.\n\nMachowski lifted the Terriers to a pair of road wins to open Southern Conference play. Opening the week with a close matchup in Cullowhee, North Carolina, the junior was within one point of his career-high, scoring 27 points while going 9-15 from the field and 4-9 from three. He also added seven rebounds, including two offensive boards, two assists, and one steal and block. Just three days later, the guard broke his career high while setting a new team high in scoring this season with 37 points at The Citadel. He found eight threes on 11 attempts, lifting him to the highest points scored by a Terrier since Fletcher Magee’s 36 points at Samford on February 15, 2019. He also went 5-5 from the line, contributing two rebounds, two assists, two steals, and a block.\n\nFor the season, the Berlin, Germany, native has started all 15 games, scoring double digits in all but two games. He is averaging 15.5 points and 4.4 rebounds per game while picking up 42 assists and 15 steals. The guard is shooting .400 percent from the field and .330 percent from three. He also leads the team in free throw shooting, going 54-66 (.818) from the line.\n\nMachowski is the first Terrier ever to earn the Lou Henson National Player of the Week award. He is the second Terrier to win SoCon Player of the Week this season. He becomes the 35th Terrier to receive the honor since joining the Southern Conference in 1997. This is the second time that a Terrier has been awarded SoCon Player of the Week in the opening weekend.\n\nThe Terriers (10-5, 2-0) open home conference play with UNC Greensboro on January 7, before heading back on the road to Macon, Georgia, to face the Mercer Bears on January 10.",

    "description": "The Los Angeles Kings are two forwards short, as center Anze Kopitar and right winger Joel Armia exited their game against the Minnesota Wild early.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Kings are forced to finish their game against the Minnesota Wild with two fewer forwards than they started with. The team will have to manage without their captain, Anze Kopitar and right winger Joel Armia.\n\nThe Kings announced that Kopitar would not return to the game with a lower-body injury, while Armia is sidelined with an upper-body injury.\n\nKopitar played just 4:54 of ice time in the first period, and didn't return for the start of the second frame. Los Angeles said he would not return during the second period.\n\nAs for Armia, his departure was announced by the Kings during the second intermission. He had 9:14 of ice time before being removed from the game, forcing Los Angeles to finish the match with 10 forwards.\n\nFrom Kopitar to Uncertainty: The Kings’ Center Crisis LOS ANGELES, CA — For two decades, the Los Angeles Kings have had the luxury franchises spend years chasing: a true number one centerman in Anze Kopitar. Alongside Jonathan Quick and Drew Doughty, the Kings formed Hockey's Holy Trinity—three franchise-level pillars down the middle, on the back end, and in net. In their primes, all three ranked among the very best at their respective positions. That spine was the foundation of two Stanley Cups in three years, before the Mike Richards and Slava Voynov situations derailed the Lombardi administration.\n\nThe Kopitar is in the final campaign to cap off a 20-year career, all of which has been with the Kings.\n\nThis is the second time this season that Kopitar has been dealing with a lower-body injury. In the middle of October, he missed about a couple of weeks with a lower-body injury.\n\nThat previous injury was from a puck hitting him in the ankle area, a clearing attempt from teammate and Kings right winger Adrian Kempe. Nonetheless, it's unclear to this point if that injury is connected to what forced him out of Los Angeles' contest with Minnesota.\n\nThis was Kopitar's 37th appearance of the season, and in that span, he's recorded six goals and 15 assists for 21 points. With that, he leads all Kings players in the plus-minus department with a plus-12 rating.\n\nGoing into this game against the Wild, Kopitar has been averaging 18:54 of ice time per game, the lowest average ice time he's ever logged in his career. He ranks fourth among forwards on the Kings in average ice time, sitting behind Kevin Fiala, Kempe, and Quinton Byfield, who leads all forwards.\n\nIn addition, the Slovenian is just one point away from reaching the 1,300 mark. Only 38 players in NHL history have reached that milestone.\n\nFurthermore, once the Kings and Wild game is in the history books, he'll be just nine games away from recording 1,500 NHL games, which only 24 players have done in NHL history.\n\nArmia, on the other hand, may have miss the Olympics if his injury is notably significant. Finland announced that Armia made the Olympic roster on Jan. 2 - the tournament begins on Feb. 11.\n\nThis season, the 32-year-old has played 41 games - including the clash with the Wild on Monday - and has registered nine goals and 16 points for the Kings.\n\nThis is Armia's first campaign with the Kings following a seven-year tenure with the Montreal Canadiens. He signed a two-year contract at $2.5 million per season in the off-season.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "fullText": "With the game tight between the Golden State Warriors and the Los Angeles Clippers in the fourth quarter, officials appeared to miss a pair of crucial calls that could've benefited the Warriors.\n\nFirst, Steph Curry was fouled before drilling a high-arcing circus shot that swished through the net. However, officials waived off a continuation on the shot, and ruled the foul on the floor, wiping away the highlight reel bucket. The Warriors went on to miss their shot after the foul followed by a 3-pointer from the Clippers on the next possession.\n\nOn the Warriors' next trip down the court, Draymond Green found Gary Payton II cutting to the basket for a layup. The layup was quickly blocked by John Collins. However, the ball appeared to touch the glass on a potential goaltending call.\n\nAfter the referees didn't blow the whistle, a furious Steve Kerr came onto the floor to argue for a goaltending call. Kerr was quickly hit with a pair of technical fouls and ejected from the game in Los Angeles.\n\nAn absolutely irate Steve Kerr was ejected after refs missed a goaltending call on the Clippers 😳 pic.twitter.com/9UIqaEvTPv\n\n— Warriors on NBCS (@NBCSWarriors) January 6, 2026\n\nWith Kerr hitting the locker room early, former Portland Trail Blazers head coach and current Golden State assistant, Terry Stotts, took over for Kerr.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Warriors' Steve Kerr ejected in 4th quarter vs Clippers",

    "description": "The New York Rangers’ 3-2 loss to the Utah Mammoth was overshadowed by Igor Shetserkin’s injury scare.",
    "fullText": "The New York Rangers’ 3-2 loss to the Utah Mammoth was overshadowed by Igor Shetserkin’s injury scare.\n\nIn the first period, with JJ Peterka driving to the net, Shesterkin’s leg seemed to get caught in an awkward position.\n\nAfter lying on the ice in agony for over a minute, Shesterkin made his way to the locker room with the help of a trainer, unable to put any weight on his leg.\n\nMike Sullivan confirmed that Shesterkin is being evaluated for a lower-body injury, but he did not delve into much detail regarding his long-term status.\n\n“I mean, obviously we don't want him to get hurt,” Sullivan said. “He's an important part of this team, and hopefully it's not too serious. I don't have an answer for you because obviously they're gonna do more more testament right now he's being evaluated.”\n\nWhile it’s never safe to assume anything, Shesterkin’s injury certainly did look concerning, and if he is indeed slated to miss a long period of time, the Rangers are in a heap of trouble.\n\nShesterkin serves as the Rangers’ engine, and his loss for any period of time is extremely problematic for the Blueshirts.\n\n“There are certain guys that drive your team. He's one of them for us,” Sullivan said of Shesterkin. “He's an elite player at his position. I think he's one of the very best in the game. When you lose a player like that for any length of time, those types of players are difficult to replace.”\n\nJonathan Quick ultimately filled in for the injured Shesterkin and recorded 14 saves on 17 shots. He set the tone, making some crucial stops while also showing a level of passion, specifically when Daniil But bumped into him, and decided to go after him.\n\nIf Shesterkin is to miss time, the Rangers will be forced to rely on the 39-year-old Quick.\n\n“He's a fierce competitor. He's still an excellent goalie,” Sullivan said of Quick. “He's one of the leaders in that room, for good reason. His body of work speaks for itself. If you ask my opinion, I think he's a first ballot Hall of Famer with what he's accomplished in the game. He loves the game, and he loves to compete, and he's very capable.”\n\nThe game, in which the Rangers were unable to hold onto a one-goal lead in the third period, en route to an overtime loss, feels meaningless due to what could possibly be at stake with Shesterkin’s injury and the ripple effect it would have on the rest of the team.\n\nAs it stands right now, the Rangers are three points out of a wild-card spot with three games in hand as it will be a dog fight to make the playoffs.\n\nIgor Shesterkin Exits Game Against Mammoth After Suffering Scary-Looking Injury In the first period of the New York <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/new-york-rangers\">Rangers</a>’ Monday night game against the Utah Mammoth, Igor Shesterkin suffered a scary-looking lower-body injury.&nbsp;\n\nThe direction Blueshirts’ general manager Chris Drury will go at the trade deadline would drastically change if Shesterkin’s injury were to be serious.\n\nWhen talking on WFAN Radio, Rangers owner James Dolan gave a vote of confidence to Drury, preaching patience as the team tries to build a culture under Sullivan, essentially ensuring Drury is not on the hot seat despite the team’s disastrous 2024-25 campaign and inconsistencies through the first half of this season.\n\nStaying a float in the Eastern Conference is a difficult task without Shesterkin.\n\nIf Shesterkin is out for a long period of time, Drury may be forced to take a selling approach at the trade deadline, directly impacting Artemi Panarin, who is set to become an unrestricted free agent this summer and is still without a long-term contract extension past the 2025-26 season.\n\nThere’s a lot that hinders on Shesterkin, and the severity of his injury will in all likelihood be revealed within the next couple of days.",

    "description": "Chicago Blackhawks Prospect Anton Frondell wins the gold Medal with Team Sweden.",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Blackhawks were excited as an organization when they selected Anton Frondell with the third overall pick in the 2025 NHL Draft. He has since been great as a teenager in the SHL, and now he is complete with the 2025-26 World Junior Championships.\n\nFrondell and Team Sweden won the Gold Medal on Monday night. This is their first Gold Medal at the World Junior Championships since 2012. Every player on the team, including Frondell, played incredibly and deserves this win.\n\nSweden defeated Czechia 4-2 to take the tournament. To get to the final game, they defeated their biggest rival in Team Finland, in a shootout (Frondell scored the winning goal). Along the way, they were great at defending, scoring, and performing on special teams.\n\nThe final three minutes of the 2026 world juniors featured enough chaos for an entire tournament, but in the end, Sweden took gold for the first time since 2012 and just the third time in tourney history. \n\n✍️: @THNRyanKennedy https://t.co/r0Bc0Sxffa\n\n— The Hockey News (@TheHockeyNews) January 6, 2026\n\nOn the Silver Medal-winning Czechia team was Blackhawks draft pick Vaclav Nestrasil. The 2025 25th overall pick had a wonderful tournament as well, including an assist in the Gold Medal Game. Once again, Czechia had a solid showing at this tournament, and Nestrasil was a big part of this one. He finished the tournament with two goals and six assists for eight points in 7 games.\n\nOn the Gold Medal-winning Sweden Team, Frondell was one of their top players. After advancing to the championship, he was named one of the \"3 Best Players on Team Sweden\". Once they won Gold, he was named to the Tournament All-Star Team, along with being called the Top Forward.\n\nFrondell scored a remarkable five goals in the tournament. He also added 3 assists for 8 points in 7 games played. Those stats, his individual awards, and the Gold Medal speak to how successful he was for his country. It won't be long before he is in Chicago's lineup, making an impact.\n\n\"Incredible,\" Frondell said when asked how it felt to win. \"I'm just so happy right now. It's crazy. I love it.\"\n\nThe young players on this team seemed to enjoy each other. Their chemistry and friendship were strong off the ice, which led to success on the ice.\n\n\"This group, it's fantastic how tight we are. We're like a big family.\" Frondell continued. \"It's important if you want to win.\"\n\nChicago did have a third player participating in the tournament. AJ Spellacy and Team USA went out during the quarterfinals. They were defeated in overtime by Team Finland, ending their quest to three-peat at the tournament. Spellacy finished with one goal and three assists for four points in five games.\n\nAhead of the Gold Medal Game, Canada defeated Finland to claim the Bronze Medal. There were no Blackhawks prospects involved in that game, but there was a lot of scouting that took place.\n\nGiven the nature of the up-and-down season that the Chicago Blackhawks are having at the NHL level, it is hard to predict where they will be drafting. However, there were a lot of great young players who showed their stuff throughout the tournament:\n\nGavin McKenna Silences Critics With Four Points In Bronze Medal Win For Canada At The World Junior Championship TSN's director of scouting said it was a \"mixed\" tournament for the top draft prospect, who tied for second among Canadians with 14 points in seven games\n\nWorld Juniors 2026: NHL Draft Eligibles Stenberg, McKenna Highlight Standouts From Medal Day Sweden did it. They're golden at the World Junior Championship for the first time since 2012, with Czechia and Canada completing the podium. These eight players stood out the most on medal day.\n\nVisit The Hockey News Chicago Blackhawks team site to stay updated on the latest news, game-day coverage, player features, and more.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "fullText": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Whew! The FCS college football season saved its best for last when Montana State defeated Illinois State in overtime to win the national championship, 35-34, on Monday night.\n\nIllinois State came into the game an unlikely unseeded finalist — and then erased a 14-point deficit to put another seeded team on the ropes, controlling the clock and the line of scrimmage before being undone by special teams and a clutch throw.\n\nThe FCS championship had it all — and social media was there for it. We took a spin around X.com for some reactions to the messy but magical championship game:\n\nFCS championship recap: Illinois State rallies, but loses OT thriller to Montana State\n\nIt seemed as if few on social media had a rooting interest, but instead appreciated the OT thriller simply for its dramatics. Multiple sports personalities chimed in with superlatives, including:\n\nEddie Radosevich of On3.com wrote: \"You are doing a disservice to yourself if you aren’t watching the FCS national championship.\"\n\nPodcaster Van Lathan Jr.: \"This FCS Natty game is insane.\"\n\nESPN commentator Kirk Herbstreit, posted after the game and congratulated both teams: \"This FCS National Championship is INCREDIBLE!!!!! Came down to an extra point in OT! ... What a game!\n\nFanDuel and TNT Sports host Mike Golic Jr: \"100000/10 finish to the FCS title game. absolutely deranged, beautiful, sloppy football. ... I need a cigarette.\"\n\nTikTok creator GFed: \"Perfect playoff for the FCS Infinitely more fun than bowl games, I will be more invested in this next season.\"\n\nThe Ringer's Rodger Sherman, posted multiple times about the game, including: \"FCS national championship was the college football game of the year. Congrats to Montana State and if you're an Illinois State fan I am so so so so so so so so so so so sorry.\"\n\nIllinois State & Montana State in Nashville on a random Monday night in January pic.twitter.com/lsRP37blGo\n\n— Barstool Greg (@iambarstoolgreg) January 6, 2026\n\nMontana State receiver Taco Dowler was the toast of X.com on Monday night. The shifty kid with a silly name scored the game-tying touchdown, pulling in a fourth-down pass from quarterback Justin Lamson in the endzone with the game on the line.\n\nThe 5-foot-9, 175-pound receiver finished with 133 scrimmage yards on nine touches, getting his unique name uttered multiple times from the ESPN announcing crew.\n\nDowler — whose real first name is McLean — apparently got his name in an unusual way.\n\n\"One account goes like this,\" wrote Mike Scherting of 406MTSports.com. \"Young McLean was in a Taco Bell drive-thru with his family when he spotted the sign and blurted out, 'That's my name.' \"\n\nMontana State kicker Myles Sansted followed the TD with the game-winning extra point — and the rest is history.\n\nIllinois State kicker Michael Coseninto had a rougher time on Monday night. The junior had a pair of kicks blocked, the first a potentially game-winning field goal in regulation and then an extra point in the first overtime.\n\nMany X.com users were less than kind. Some blamed the snap, some the holder, many the kicker. One user decided to call out all three: \"Illinois State has a snapper who can’t snap, a holder who can’t hold and a kicker who can’t kick.\"\n\nIllinois State has a snapper who can’t snap, a holder who can’t hold and a kicker who can’t kick. pic.twitter.com/2FrIDVFNwb\n\n— Thomas Casale (@TheTomCasale) January 6, 2026\n\nOther users called out ISU coach Brock Spack for even putting Cosentino into that situation at the end of regulation, with many thinking Spack should have kept his offense on the field on fourth-and-1.\n\n\"Love everything Brock Spack has done for this program, but I hate the call to go for a FG. HATE,\" wrote Chris Rongey, a former WSCR-AM 670 reporter now at KMOX in St. Louis. The Illinois State alumnus later said, \"I'll never get over that FG call. Awful, awful decision.\"\n\nLove everything Brock Spack has done for this program, but I hate the call to go for a FG. HATE.\n\n— Chris Rongey (@ChrisRongey) January 6, 2026\n\nPodcaster Geoff Schwartz of SiriusXM, ahead of overtime, criticized the idea to kick, writing: \"Illinois State had to gain one yard for the championship and choose to kick a FG instead. A decision that will haunt the coach if they can’t finish the game in OT.\"\n\nMultiple well-wishers congratulated both teams, with champion Montana State finally breaking through after multiple runner-up finishes over the last few years.\n\nMany Illinois State fans thanked the team for its unlikely run through the playoffs.\n\n\"Loss sucks. I cannot begin to imagine the pain in the Illinois State locker room,\" 2025 ISU graduate Noah Powell posted. \"However, build the Brock Spack statue. Even if he never wins the big one, he has transformed Illinois State football into one of the nation's top programs.\"\n\nLoss sucks.

(AP) — Kawhi Leonard had 24 points and 12 rebounds, rookie Kobe Sanders added 20 points, and the Los Angeles Clippers edged the Golden State Warriors 103-102 on Monday night in a wild game that included Warriors coach Steve Kerr getting ejected and Steph Curry fouling out for the first time since 2021.\n\nKerr was ejected with 7:57 remaining in the game after becoming irate when the Clippers’ John Collins wasn’t called for goaltending. A shouting Kerr pursued the referees along the sideline and had to be restrained by his assistants before getting tossed.\n\nCurry scored 27 points but was just 4 for 15 from 3-point range and 9 for 23 overall before fouling out with 42 seconds remaining in the game. He fouled out for the first time since Dec. 17, 2021, at Boston.\n\nJames Harden was a late scratch for the Clippers because of right shoulder soreness. But they got double-figure scoring from all five starters, including Sanders, whose points were a career high. Collins added 18 points and Kris Dunn had 16. Ivica Zubac had 11 rebounds.\n\nJimmy Butler added 24 points for the Warriors, who lost to the Clippers for the eighth straight time on the road.\n\nCurry fouled Dunn with 42 seconds left and the Warriors trailing 101-100 after Curry's back-to-back 3-pointers. Dunn made both free throws before Draymond Green scored in the lane to pull the Warriors within one.\n\nLeonard missed a jumper and the Warriors grabbed the defensive rebound. Butler missed a 16-footer before time expired.\n\nNeither team shot well from 3. The Clippers were 10 for 29, while the Warriors were 10 for 41.\n\nThe Warriors closed within four early in the fourth before the Clippers outscored them 16-7 to lead 94-81. Leonard scored six and Collins had five.\n\nGolden State ran off nine straight, including seven by Butler, to trail 94-90.\n\nGolden State had won six of eight coming into what was a playoff-like atmosphere that included rapper Snoop Dogg doing commentary for the game streamed on Peacock. It was a matchup of the NBA's two oldest teams. The average age of the Clippers' roster is 30.0 to 29.6 for the Warriors.\n\nGreen dove for a loose ball and crashed into his team's bench late in the first half. The team said he sustained a rib contusion, but he remained in the game. Green had 12 assists while going 0 of 6 from 3-point range.\n\nWarriors: Host the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday in the opener of an eight-game homestand.\n\nClippers: Visit the New York Knicks on Wednesday to open a three-game Eastern trip.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNick Kyrgios' hopes of playing in the Australian Open are under threat after a first-round defeat at the Brisbane International.\n\nThe 30-year-old was frequently seen wincing and grasping at his elbow during the straight sets defeat to American journeyman Aleksandar Kovacevic 6-3 6-4 on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn the early stages of the match, Kyrgios was smiling as he matched the world no.60 but when the American got on top, the mood turned sour with the Aussie looking pained with his right elbow.\n\nKovacevic snared the first set after converting the only break point he created, while Kyrgios didn't get any opportunities on his opponent's serve and only struck four winners to American's 14.\n\nMORE:Novak Djokovic makes shock decision ahead of the Australian Open\n\nIt was relatively even second set also, but Kyrgios gave up a break in the ninth game, before Kovacevic easily served the match out.\n\nKyrgios is relying on getting a wildcard off Tennis Australia to participate at the major, with it clear both parties are waiting to see if he will be fit enough to compete at Melbourne Park.\n\nThe Wimbledon finalist himself admitted he wouldn't accept a wildcard for the Australian Open unless he could compete at a high level.\n\n\"[John] Milliman gave his wildcard up for me when he was injured at the French Open,\" he said prior to the Brisbane International.\n\n\"He wasn't feeling 100 per cent, and that is where everything kicked off for me in my career. After that moment, I became a different player. I learned so much.\n\n\"If I am feeling great and I can get through this week and perform at the Australian Open ... people are paying good money to be there. If I can't give them the Kyrgios experience I would genuinely rather give it to someone that earned the wildcard and is in tip-top shape to start off something special in their career.\"\n\nIt wasn't a good sign for Kyrgios being beaten fairly easily by Kovacevic, who is a 27-year-old journeyman.\n\nIf it was just rust and lack of match fitness, Kyrgios still has time to get his game ready for the Australian Open with an appearance scheduled at the Kooyong Classic.\n\nBut after playing only six professional matches since being struck down with wrist and knee injuries in 2022, it's hard to believe we will ever see Kyrgios at his best again.\n\nThe best of Kyrgios - that we are likely to see again - is on the doubles court with Thanasi Kokkinakis or in the commentary box.",

    "fullText": "Knicks owner crushes dreams of fans hoping for Giannis Antetokounmpo trade originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNew York Knicks fans hoping that the team will trade for disgruntled Milwaukee Bucks star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo will be disappointed by recent comments from Knicks owner James Dolan.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on The Carton Show, Dolan said that the organization is very happy with the roster as currently constructed and doesn’t see any major moves on the horizon.\n\n“We love our team right now. They have chemistry. They all like each other,” Dolan said. “I’ve never seen a locker room more copacetic. There’s a lot of energy in there. Leon [Rose] can always overrule me, but I don’t see us making a big change. This group can win a championship. I believe that.”\n\nLast year, the Knicks made it to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 2000, and they're looking to improve upon that finish this season. Dolan seems to believe that health and continuity is what the Knicks need to take the next step, not a major shakeup.\n\n“Look how far we got with our group last year,” Dolan said. “Then take a look at who was playing and who wasn’t. We had injuries. Now we’re going into the second half of the season with more depth. If we stay healthy, we’ll go into the playoffs in much better condition.”\n\nThe trade deadline is about a month away, and New York has been frequently mentioned as a potential landing spot for Antetokounmpo. But, if Dolan is to be taken at his word, that won’t be happening any time soon.\n\nPerhaps if the Knicks have an early exit from the postseason, Dolan could change his stance regarding the roster over the offseason. But for now, Knicks fans shouldn’t hold their breath for an Antetokounmpo trade.\n\nNew York Knicks owner shares harsh criticism of Tom Thibodeau\n\nJames Dolan explains why Knicks won't hang NBA Cup banner",

    "fullText": "Missing K League already? The 2026 season will be one to savour, partly because of some changes that are coming in 2027.\n\nThe 2026 season will be the last of a 12-team K League 1 and will see the end of the split, Final A and Final B system. From 2027, K League 1 will have 14 teams with three round robins. It is the end of an era. The split system came into effect in 2012 in what was a 16-team K League 1, then a 14-team division in 2013, before becoming the 12-team league it is today the following year.\n\nKicking things off when the weather is still extremely chilly, February 21st will see Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors host Daejeon Hana Citizen in K League's first Super Cup since 2006. Jeonbuk have won the Super Cup once and finished runners-up twice, while Daejeon finished runners-up in 2002 in their only appearance. The season curtain raiser will see the K League 1 champions host the Korea Cup winners, or in the event of a team doing the double, the league champions will host the runners-up instead.\n\nSpeaking of cups, the Korea Cup is switching to an autumn-spring format from 2026, with Round 1 through the Round of 16 (Round 4) to take place in July and August 2026, with the quarterfinals through the final held in May and June 2027. The change, the KFA says, is intended to better align with the AFC Champions League schedule and broader international football trends, while also enabling clubs to field their strongest squads in both the K League and the Korea Cup.\n\nSpeaking of eras ending. After five years in Gimcheon, the army team is leaving. With the affiliation agreement between the K League, the Korea Armed Forces Athletic Corps (Sangmu), and Gimcheon City set to expire at the end of 2026, it has been decided that if Gimcheon City establishes a citizen-owned club, or if the Armed Forces Athletic Corps establishes a new club in a different home city and either side enters the K League from 2027, both clubs will compete in K League 2. In short, regardless of where Gimcheon finish in 2026, they will be relegated to K League 2. It is currently unclear what the army team's plans are in terms of a new home, and indeed whether the city of Gimcheon will create a citizen club.\n\nThe Gimcheon situation, coupled with an expanded K League 1 from 2027, means that the promotion and relegation system will look a bit different. There will be three guaranteed promotion spots in 2026, but how this will play out depends on where Gimcheon finish in the league standings.\n\nIf Gimcheon Sangmu finish 12th, only Gimcheon Sangmu are relegated and K League 2’s top two teams will be automatically promoted. The teams finishing third to sixth enter a four-team playoff, with the winner promoted to mean three up. No Promotion–Relegation Playoff with a K League 1 team will be held.\n\nHowever, if Gimcheon Sangmu do not finish 12th, they are relegated regardless, but the team finishing 12th in K League 1 enters a Promotion–Relegation Playoff. K League 2’s top two-placed teams gain automatic promotion. The third to sixth-placed teams in K League 2 compete in a four-team playoff. The team that wins the promotion decider faces the K League 1 bottom side in the Promotion–Relegation Playoff.\n\nFor the first time since the early 2000s, K League teams will be allowed to sign foreign goalkeepers. A ban was put in place in order to help nuture goalkeepers for the national team, and there had long been calls for the ban to be lifted with the Taeguk Warriors in plenty of reliable custodians. Yongin FC became the first K League team to sign a foreign goalkeeper, acquiring Portuguese stopper Emanuel Novo.\n\nThe ban on foreign goalkeepers comes with a sort of complete lifting of foreign player restrictions. Clubs will now be able to sign as many foreign players as they wish, with five able to be on the pitch at the same time, up from four. The move is seen as a way of helping K League clubs stay competitive in AFC Champions League following the AFC's move to completely scrap the foreign player quota. In K League 2, the rule will remain the same: a maximum of four foreign players on the field at any one time.\n\nThe number of players allowed on the K League 2 matchday squad will increase from 18 to a maximum of 20. This change is intended to increase flexibility in the use of substitutes, improve overall match performance, and ensure playing opportunities for domestic players following the expansion of the foreign player registration quota. K League 1 has been operating with 20-player matchday squads since the 2024 season.\n\nThe often-abused and merely circumvented U22 player rule, whereby teams must start a player under the age of 22 and name another on the bench to be able to make five substitutions, has been scrapped in K League 1. However, at least two U22 players must still be named in the 20-man matchday squad. If only one U22 player is listed, the squad will be reduced to 19 players; if none are included, it will be limited to 18. The rule remains in place as it was in K League 2 meaning, in theory, young players should get more first-team opportunities in the second tier from 2026 onwards.\n\nFor only the third time ever, K League 1 will have a team brand new to the top tier. Bucheon FC 1995's promotion via the playoffs earned the Reds a spot in K League 1 for the very first time, following Suwon FC in 2015 and FC Anyang in 2024. Suwon last just a season before going straight back down again, but Anyang survived in 2025; how will Bucheon do?\n\nThere will be three new teams joining K League 2 to make a 17-team division: Paju Frontier, Gimhae FC 2008, and Yongin FC, two teams in Gyeonggi Province and one in the southeast.\n\nPaju Frontier, initially named Paju Citizen, were formed in 2012 and spent the last five seasons in K3, finishing 10th last year. Yongin FC are technically a brand new club, founded this year, but have K League landed Lee Dong-gook as technical director and have already signed some big names. Gimhae FC 2008 were founded in, yes, you guessed it, 2008, and actually finished top of K3 last year, clinching their second K3 title, having also won it in 2020.",

    "description": "Raich Carter led the Lads to a famous FA Cup final victory in 1937. But Sunderland had another captain — every bit as much a hero as the man whose mural proudly looks down from the Blue House pub in his home town of Hendon.",
    "fullText": "The name Raich Carter is firmly embedded within the lore of Sunderland AFC and the hearts and minds of its followers.\n\nA son of Hendon, he was the local lad come good – a one-goal-every-two-games inside-forward who would lead the club to league and cup glory in the late 1930s and who is still, to this day, one of the youngest-ever captains to lead a side to top-flight English success. Having led the club to the English First Division in 1936 – that is the Premier League in old money for the millennial masses – he was then presented with the prospect of leading the side out at Wembley the following year in the FA Cup Final.\n\nMillwall had been successfully overcome in the semi-final three weeks earlier, with Sunderland showing the resilience to come from behind. The final whistle at Leeds Road, Huddersfield, brought the typical emotions – the elation that comes with success in such settings and, of course, the anticipation of the weeks ahead and the looming date with destiny as Sunderland aspired to return to Wearside laden with silverware.\n\nThe fortitude shown to come from behind would again be evident during English football’s end-of-season showpiece on 1st May as Preston, ahead at half-time, succumbed to the Wearside warriors in the second half, with Raich Carter amongst the goalscorers.\n\nBut Sunderland had another captain in 1937 — every bit as much a hero as the man whose mural proudly looks down from the Blue House pub in his home town of Hendon. Arguably more so.\n\nCaptain Frederick Robinson would have celebrated each FA Cup tie being won as much as anyone, but by the time Sunderland headed to Yorkshire in the hope Wembley was soon to follow, the focus of Captain Robinson, bred in the Barnes area, was on an upcoming journey that had more than memories and medals at stake.\n\nIn an increasingly polarised continent, Europe was coming to terms with the political phenomenon of fascism. Whilst some of its ingredients were hardly novel, the idea of absolutism and othering communities had been adequately packaged and presented with its symbology a nod to Roman history.\n\nThe adherence to such ideology had found allure, with Germany, Italy, and Spain the notable victims as an antithesis to the democratic will of the people became evident. In the latter, Spain, the 1936 election won by the Popular Front was both disputed and dismissed by Franco and his sycophants.\n\nA fascist disputing the electoral endorsement of the people. Wouldn’t happen now, eh…\n\nThe ensuing civil discord, carefully crafted by Franco, brought about the Spanish Civil War and, for the Spanish people, the demise of parliamentary democracy for four decades.\n\nBut some would not stand idly by. Not merely the Spanish people but ordinary decent people beyond Iberian borders.\n\nOne such individual was our very own Frederick Robinson. And by the time Sunderland and Preston were engaged in battle at Wembley he, with others from Sunderland, the wider North-East, and beyond, was the captain of the SS Knitsley as it made its way to Spain to bring aid to the beleaguered Basque people. Despite the trepidation of what lay ahead, on 1st May 1937 the crew of the ship had, temporarily, other matters to focus on.\n\nSunderland, their home-town club, were at Wembley, and for several hours these local heroes, part of what we know now as the International Brigade, were able to use the ship’s radio to keep abreast of how events were unfolding in London.\n\nThey celebrated. Briefly. Before long emotions were balanced and the precarious nature of their mission realised.\n\nSome made it to Spain. Some did not. Some took down aid whilst others took up arms. All to fight on behalf of the poor and disenfranchised. Their humanity and heroism is not diluted by the outcome of the conflict; it lies in their willingness to confront evil and the preparedness to make the final sacrifice if needed.\n\nThey are memorialised across modern Spain, from street name to statue, from plaque to plaza.\n\nThere is, however, no fitting memory or memorial to Captain Robinson and others from Sunderland within Wearside.\n\nIncredibly, if you want to see the inscribed names of those from Sunderland who fought Franco and fascism you have to go to the garden and grounds of Newcastle Civic Centre.\n\nThat, however, is about to change. With the assistance of the community that reared such heroes.\n\nSolidarity Sunderland are in the process of trying to ensure that those who, as the oft-espoused football chant says, were “one of our own” can have their voices heard and story told through a public memorial that accurately reflects their demonstrable opposition to the social disharmony and destruction of political poison.\n\nIf every second Saturday you go to the Stadium of Light to support a footballing International Brigade – all colours, creeds, and nationalities – then surely we can honour the local volunteers who were part of one that had so much more to lose than a football match.\n\nGet involved – your time and input can prove as invaluable as any financial contribution.\n\nFind out more at https://solidaritypark.com/solidarity-sunderland/\n\nPlease contact – solidaritysunderland@gmail.com",

    "description": "You felt that if the game had gone on for another ten minutes we might have sneaked a winner, but a point in the circumstances is still a more than satisfactory result which made the dreaded return to work on Monday a slightly less depressing prospect.",
    "fullText": "In his epic poem The Waste Land, T.S. Eliot remarked that April is the cruellest month, but I doubt he ever had to face up to three away games in six days at the beginning of January. At any other time of year the prospect of three back-to-back trips to new stadia within six days would be the stuff of dreams for a travelling fan, but straight after Christmas when everyone is skint, freezing, and/or wrestling with attempts at self-improvement, it almost seemed like a cruel joke.\n\nStill, at least those of us lucky enough to already be based in the capital wouldn’t have to face up to a lengthy car journey or risk putting our fate in the hands of Network Rail. Our first trip to the imaginatively named Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was earmarked by many fans back when the fixtures were released, and enthusiasm was high despite the annoying Sunday kick-off.\n\nThe blue-and-white side of North London have really taken their trademark “Spursiness” to new levels this season, boasting one of the best away records in the league while being incredibly generous in dishing out points at their shiny new home. A smug Mag mate of mine commented that the ground isn’t really “new” to most teams at this point, to which I gave the natural reply of “one-nil”.\n\nOur African absentees haven’t affected our results as dramatically as most commentators would have expected/hoped, so most Sunderland fans were reasonably confident of adding at least one point to our tally as we passed the halfway stage of the season.\n\nWith Spurs being the second-most convenient destination for me behind West Ham, I was excited to host some of our fellow fans who had travelled south for the game at my local in Walthamstow, only to be embarrassed to learn that (contrary to its Google Maps entry) the doors would only open at 11 a.m. rather than at ten. Thankfully we didn’t have to wait too long in the cold, and a few early ales set the tone for the day. We swiftly moved on to the Antwerp Arms, which had a healthy mix of home and away fans congregating under the watchful eye of a hi-vis-clad security guard with a megaphone. This seemed a bit excessive for a pub, but I suppose you can never be too careful.\n\nAfter entering the ground we basked in the spacious and well-stocked concourse, taking a moment to reflect on just how many light years away the whole matchday experience was from Accrington, Fleetwood et al. The view from our seats in the lower tier didn’t actually encompass the whole pitch, but thankfully the huge screens on each corner of the ground meant we could keep abreast of the action.\n\nUnfortunately not much of it was down at the end Sunderland were attacking as the team served up one of the least inspiring performances of the season so far. A better side than Spurs could have really taken us to the sword, and the statuesque marking for Ben Davies’ opener seemed to unfold in slow motion.\n\nThe lethargy on the pitch was sadly matched by a subdued atmosphere in the away end. Far be it from me to say how anyone should conduct themselves at the match, but the players and coach have commented repeatedly on how much the passion and noise from the fans helps to drive the team on, so it was disappointing that many supporters weren’t able to provide more vocal backing to the team in the first half, especially given the excellent season we’ve enjoyed to date.\n\nThankfully there was a marked improvement on and off the pitch in the second half. The introduction of Ballard added some much-needed balance to our play, and when an excellent move was lashed home by Brobbey the away end sparked into raptures. You felt that if the game had gone on for another ten minutes we might have sneaked a winner, but a point in the circumstances is still a more than satisfactory result which made the dreaded return to work on Monday a slightly less depressing prospect. One down, three to go…",

    "description": "Now fully submerged into the infamously hectic winter schedule, I thought it appt to assess the main talking points",
    "fullText": "This period of the season has been at the forefront of every supporter’s mind since the start of the season, especially with the arrival of so many AFCON participants. It is a tough portion of the campaign for any team, never mind one with six first-team players unavailable.\n\nThe first yellow-card suspension line falls right in the middle and, with the increased demand on the players, injuries are common. So far we have dealt with this well.\n\nWe are unbeaten in the four games since AFCON started and since the fixtures started piling up. All four points were hard-fought and deserved, adding to our tally and keeping the ball rolling.\n\nHowever, this already difficult task may get a lot more difficult with two more games in the next six days.\n\nI love and believe in each and every player in our squad. They have all proved themselves to be brilliant, talented footballers who are prepared to leave everything out on the pitch for our club. That being said, they are only human – they don’t run on rechargeable double-A batteries. With our list of unavailable players, Le Bris’ team selection is almost forced. This was epitomised by a message someone sent into the Spurs match radio reaction on BBC. It was along the lines of “we looked very tired in that first half – why isn’t RLB rotating?”. Gary Bennett’s response was truthful and, in my opinion, correct – Do you really want anyone on the bench to be starting?\n\nPersonally I would not want O’Nien, Neil, or Hjelde to be in a starting eleven. Mundle and Rigg are capable, but I don’t think either of them have done enough to displace Mayenda or Adingra. As the season has progressed we have proven ourselves to be able to compete with anyone in this league, so deciding to drop any of the starting eleven for any of those bench players I have mentioned seems ridiculous. Every game provides an opportunity to get more points on the board, and not using the best eleven available greatly reduces the quality of the team and our chances of success.\n\nI know that it is unsustainable to start the same eleven players every game, but the bench seems so weak now that I don’t see an alternative. We give ourselves another issue by playing both Mayenda and Brobbey. Normally one would start and the other would replace them. This issue was exacerbated by Wilson Isidor being out against Tottenham. It is described as a minor injury by Régis, who hopes that he will be available against Brentford, so that is a relief.\n\nLooking ahead, some of our African stars could be returning soon. As I am writing this, Morocco and Talbi, as well as Senegal and Diarra, have qualified, but Mozambique, DR Congo, and Burkina Faso are yet to play. Hopefully they all lose and can return sooner rather than later. Even if they do lose though, they will still not be available for the midweek game against Brentford.\n\nAnother trip to London beckons on Wednesday. We beat Brentford in the reverse fixture, but they have proved to be a very capable team in recent weeks. They have an in-form striker and a well-established, difficult-to-play-against tactic. It will be another tough game and one in which the effects of this chock-a-block schedule could be clear.\n\nAfter that the FA Cup takes us to Merseyside with a first-ever trip to the Hill Dickinson Arena on the cards, and over 7,000 Mackems will follow the Lads west. This is the chance to rotate that we have been looking for, but might be slightly disappointing for the fans taking this expensive trip to Everton (just after Christmas as well) to see a second-choice team play. Regardless, I am sure that the supporters will understand and be grateful that we have this chance to give the rest of the Lads a break. It will be nice to visit this new stadium and see some of the players that helped us get into the Premier League in action.\n\nOverall this demanding period of the season is a difficult problem to navigate, but one in which we have traversed well so far. There are still a few games to go in this overloaded programme, but hopefully we get through it unscathed and with our players returning from Africa soon.",

    "description": "Charlotte Patterson looks at whether Hetton is where the Lasses should be — or whether things could change in the future",
    "fullText": "The question of where Sunderland AFC Women should call “home? isn’t simply about bricks, grass and turnstiles.\n\nInstead, it cuts right to the heart of what the women’s team is, who it’s for, and how seriously the club and the wider footballing world are prepared to take it.\n\nIn recent years, as the Lasses have reestablished themselves in the upper tiers of the pyramid and the women’s game has gathered momentum nationally, the suitability of Eppleton Colliery Welfare Ground has come under increasing scrutiny.\n\nOn paper, the club’s women’s side belongs to a major football institution with a 49,000‑seat stadium on the banks of the Wear. In practice, they’re based at a 2,500‑capacity ground in Hetton‑le‑Hole, with all the charm and complications that entails.\n\nTo understand whether Eppleton remains the right home, it’s necessary to overlook nostalgia and frustration and look squarely at what the ground offers, what it lacks, and what it symbolises. Geography, transport, parking, amenities, attendances, atmosphere, the tactical realities of the pitch and the alternative represented by the Stadium of Light all need to be weighed together.\n\nTwo to three years ago, I wrote a similar article years ago on what keeps fans away from watching the Lasses at Eppleton. It spoke to many of issues such as awkward Sunday kick offs, cost‑of‑living pressure, low‑key marketing and the simple difficulty of getting to Hetton if you don’t live nearby.\n\nThose themes still ring true, but the picture has shifted slightly as the game has grown and as the club has experimented more with games at the Stadium of Light.\n\nEppleton’s geographical location is both part of its appeal and part of its problem. Hetton is steeped in mining heritage and working‑class identity — and Eppleton Colliery Welfare Ground is exactly the kind of place where football feels knitted into the life of a community rather than sitting apart from it.\n\nFor longtime supporters, the ground carries memories of youth games, local ties, and a sense that the Lasses are still closely connected to the roots of the region.\n\nSunderland Women aren’t tucked away in an anonymous training complex — they’re visible in a town that understands graft, resilience and collective pride. That creates a sense of authenticity which many supporters cherish, and particularly those who feel somewhat alienated by the commercialism of the top end of the men’s game.\n\nHowever, what feels local and rooted to one person can feel remote and inconvenient to another.\n\nThe very fact that Eppleton is in Hetton rather than the centre of Sunderland makes it awkward for a significant chunk of the potential audience. There’s no Metro stop, no easy stroll from the city centre and no simple hop from Shields, Newcastle or Durham. For supporters without a car — particularly younger fans or families who might be bringing children to their first women’s game — the journey can seem like more work than it’s worth.\n\nSunday afternoon fixtures, often with early or slightly odd kick off times dictated by broadcasts or scheduling, can make it even harder to justify the trip, especially in winter when daylight is short and the North East weather isn’t exactly welcoming.\n\nPublic transport does technically exist, but it doesn’t operate with the frequency or convenience that turns a matchday into an easy habit. Buses run, but not on a pattern designed around football crowds, and the walk from stop to the ground isn’t always obvious if you don’t know the area.\n\nFor a committed core, this is all just part of the routine: you plan, you drive, you share lifts and you work it out.\n\nFor the more casual or curious supporter — the person the women’s game needs to attract to grow beyond its hard core — these frictions stack up. None of them are individually insurmountable. Together, they form a quiet, persistent deterrent.\n\nParking is a good example of that cumulative effect.\n\nEppleton doesn’t have the parking infrastructure of a major stadium — and it was never designed to. Matchdays often involve a slightly improvised dance of cars dotting around local streets, shared car parks and patchwork solutions.\n\nLocals tend to be tolerant, and there’s a kind of grassroots charm in seeing ordinary estates absorb the matchday traffic in the way they have for decades at non‑league grounds across the country. But for visitors or for those who arrive later than planned, it can be stressful and confusing. Bigger games only amplify the issue, as more cars arrive than the immediate area can comfortably absorb.\n\nIn contrast, the Stadium of Light is built to usher tens of thousands in and out with relative efficiency.\n\nMultiple official car parks, stewarding, signage and a road network moulded around Premier League‑era crowds mean that even a modest turnout for a women’s fixture benefits from that infrastructure.\n\nCombined with the Stadium of Light Metro station and strong public transport links, it delivers a smoother, more predictable logistical experience from front door to seat and back again. That kind of reliability matters — especially for families, disabled supporters and those travelling from outside Sunderland — and it’s one of the clearest areas where the big stadium is objectively superior.\n\nAmenities tell a similar story.\n\nEppleton offers what you would expect of a small, traditional football ground: toilets, a small food hut, limited indoor space and a basic but functional seated stand. For regulars, this suffices. They know what they’re getting, they dress for the weather and they accept that this isn’t a Premier League experience.\n\nHowever, as the women’s game increasingly pitches itself as a family‑friendly day out and as rival clubs invest in their fan experience, Eppleton’s limitations become more glaring. If you’ve queued in cold rain for a single food outlet with limited choice or tried to juggle a coffee, a child and a programme without anywhere to take shelter, you immediately feel the gap between aspiration and reality.\n\nThe Stadium of Light, of course, was purpose‑built for a very different scale.\n\nMultiple kiosks, covered concourses, accessible toilets, proper hospitality spaces and comfortable seating make the matchday feel more polished. It’s easier to get a drink, easier to buy food, and easier to keep warm and mostly dry in miserable weather. For someone attending their first women’s match, it offers an experience that says “big club” — and that matters at a time when visibility, optics and perceived seriousness are central to how women’s football is judged.\n\nYet that strength comes with a paradox: the infrastructure impresses, but if the stands are sparse and the noise is thin, the overall impression can still feel underwhelming or even sad.\n\nThis is where attendance and atmosphere intersect in complicated ways.\n\nOn the face of it, the growth of crowds for women’s football in England is one of the game’s success stories. We have seen record‑breaking attendances in the WSL and WSL2, including the at the Wear-Tyne/Tyne-Wear derby at the Stadium of Light (an attendance of 15,387 last season) and St James’s Park (38,502 last season and 18,972  this season). Those headline numbers show what is possible in the right circumstances: local rivalry, strong marketing, a big stadium, and a sense of occasion.\n\nHowever, those “spike events” don’t reflect the reality of week‑to‑week football at Eppleton, as Sunderland Women typically attract crowds measured in the high hundreds at best, and low hundreds at worst.\n\nEppleton’s 2,500 capacity — with just 250 seats — means that a turnout which would look completely lost at the Stadium of Light can feel warm and alive in Hetton. When 800 or 1,200 people are gathered tightly around the pitch, the sound collects and carries. You feel every shout, hear every instruction, and sense the emotional texture of the game.\n\nThat intimacy is one of the defining qualities of women’s football and a big part of what draws people back. The players can hear individual voices, recognise regulars, and feel tangibly supported even when the numbers are modest.\n\nMove that same crowd into a 49,000‑seat bowl and the arithmetic of atmosphere turns against you.\n\nThe singing sections might do their best, but the sound dissipates into empty tiers of red plastic and the camera pans across swathes of unoccupied seats. What felt like a healthy, noisy and committed crowd at Eppleton suddenly looks anaemic and isolated. This isn’t because the fans have become any less passionate — it’s because the scale of the environment dwarfs them and in terms of pure atmosphere per person, Eppleton wins hands down.\n\nThe psychological effect on players shouldn’t be underestimated either.\n\nAt Eppleton, the pitch is tight, the supporters are close, and the environment feels manageable, almost personal. The Lasses know every blade of grass, every echo and every sightline.\n\nVisiting teams often comment on how awkward and intense it can be to play there — and that isn’t an accident. Sunderland’s women have historically built their identity on organisation, work rate and intensity, pressing hard, working in tight units and transitioning quickly, and so a more compact pitch allows those strengths to surface more naturally.\n\nThe Stadium of Light, meanwhile, offers a pitch closer to the standard of the elite men’s game: wide, long, demanding physical range and positional discipline in larger spaces.\n\nIt’s not that women can’t or shouldn’t play on such a surface, as many top women’s sides do so brilliantly. But the reality is that the squad depth, conditioning and tactical patterns in the WSL2 aren’t always perfectly tuned to that scale and Sunderland have sometimes looked stretched there, both physically and mentally.\n\nWhen the ball is on the far side of the pitch; when the crowd noise is diffused and when runs have to cover an extra few yards every time, the burden can tell. The Lasses often seem to struggle on the big pitch of the Stadium of Light, and that impression is widely shared among fans who’ve watched them in both venues.\n\nThe pitch isn’t the only thing that changes inside a stadium — the expectations do as well.\n\nPlayers talk about feeling the difference of walking out of a tunnel into a huge bowl they share with the men’s team. It can be inspiring, but it can also be intimidating and emotionally draining if the stands are only sparsely populated. The same space that’s electric when 40,000 roar can feel eerily quiet when there are a couple of thousand dotted around. You sense the ghosts of what the stadium could be, and that can weigh on a team trying to play its best and most instinctive football.\n\nHowever, none of this means that the Stadium of Light should be rejected out of hand as it remains a powerful symbol of ambition and parity, and when Sunderland Women step onto that pitch, under that roof and in front of that crest, the optics are clear: this club takes its women’s side seriously enough to put them on the main stage.\n\nMajor events such as a Wear-Tyne derby, a promotion push or a cup tie against a big name deserve and benefit from that setting. Record‑chasing attendances at the Stadium of Light don’t just generate nice headlines — they create memories for supporters and players that Eppleton, with all its character, simply can’t.\n\nThe question, then, isn’t “Eppleton or the Stadium of Light, now and forever?” but “How do we balance what each offers at this stage of the journey?”\n\nEppleton supplies week‑to‑week atmosphere, a pitch that suits the team, and continuity of identity, whereas the Stadium of Light supplies infrastructure, visibility, and a platform for growth.\n\nThere are very real barriers that keep fans away from Eppleton — including the cost and time of travel, competing weekend duties, limited marketing and a lingering sense that women’s fixtures are somewhat peripheral compared to the men’s programme.\n\nMost of those factors are still in play but what’s changed is that we now have more evidence of what can be achieved when the women’s team is placed front and centre at the main stadium with a proper promotional push.\n\nCrucially, though, those big events don’t automatically translate into consistent attendance growth, and someone who turns up for a record‑breaking derby may not be prepared to trek to Hetton for a mid‑table clash in the wind and rain.\n\nThat’s not necessarily a failure — it’s just a reminder that the pathways to being a regular fan of Sunderland Women are varied. Some will be drawn in through the Stadium of Light spectacle and then gradually discover Eppleton’s raw charm, and others will always prefer the intimacy of Hetton and the feeling that they’re part of a tight‑knit community and not just one face among thousands.\n\nThere is also a structural reality at play.\n\nSunderland Women remain part of a club operating within financial constraints, navigating the complicated economics of both men’s and women’s football. Opening the Stadium of Light is expensive; staffing, stewarding, utilities and operational costs all rise, and for a typical WSL2 fixture, the sums may simply not make sense unless a certain attendance threshold is realistically achievable.\n\nEppleton, in contrast, is far cheaper to operate and easier to fit around training schedules and day‑to‑day logistics. Any conversation about moving the women’s team permanently to the Stadium of Light has to grapple honestly with those financial and practical considerations — particularly given the men play there also and it would require much more ground maintenance and work to be completed.\n\nBeyond the numbers, there’s also the question of what “home” actually feels like.\n\nEppleton is where the Lasses have earned promotions, endured difficult seasons, and rebuilt. It’s where young fans have waited at the barriers for selfies and autographs and where families have grown into the habit of making that slightly awkward trip, because once you’re inside, everything feels close, human and real.\n\nThat kind of emotional capital simply can’t be transplanted overnight. The Stadium of Light has the potential to become that kind of home if the women were to play there regularly, but it would take time, patience and consistent investment in matchday experience — not just sporadic showcase games.\n\nThe most realistic and constructive way forward — at least in the medium term — lies in embracing a “hybrid model” with honesty rather than embarrassment.\n\nEppleton can remain the beating heart of Sunderland Women, the place where regular league fixtures are contested on a pitch that suits the team and in front of a crowd that feels present and loud. The Stadium of Light can be used strategically: for derbies, promotion six‑pointers, family‑themed events in school holidays and fixtures chosen to coincide with wider club campaigns.\n\nOver time, as the core audience grows and the club’s capacity to market and support the women’s programme expands, the balance could tip naturally toward more games at the big stadium — and that evolution would feel earned rather than imposed.\n\nSeen in that light, the advantages and disadvantages of Eppleton become less about right versus wrong and more about fit versus aspiration.\n\nIts location, parking, amenities and accessibility do hold the team back from reaching some supporters who might otherwise come along. Yet it’s also the place where the women’s side currently looks and feels most like itself: compact, combative, close to its people. The Stadium of Light, meanwhile, is the future horizon, a venue that matches the scale of Sunderland’s name and the ambition of the women’s game, but which can still feel too big for where things are, week in, week out.\n\nIn the end, the real task isn’t simply to choose a ground, but to build a culture that makes either venue genuinely feel alive.\n\nBetter promotion, clearer information about travel and parking, coordinated lifts and coach schemes from the city centre, stronger links with schools and community groups in both Sunderland and Hetton, and visible, consistent messaging from the club that the women’s team are central to its identity. These things matter just as much as bricks and seats — and if those foundations are laid, Eppleton and the Stadium of Light stop being opposing options and instead become two different stages on the same journey.\n\nFor now, Eppleton remains both a blessing and a constraint. It’s awkward to reach but rewarding once you arrive. It lacks polish but offers connection. It does not scream ambition, but it whispers something more important: that football can still belong to ordinary people in ordinary places, even as it strives to grow.\n\nWhatever the future holds and whether Sunderland AFC Women eventually take up permanent residence at the Stadium of Light or a new solution emerges, Eppleton will remain a vital chapter in their story — the small ground in Hetton where the Lasses kept going, kept competing, and kept inviting people in even when so many forces conspired to keep them away.\n\nAll of this comes with an important caveat, one that’s essential to state clearly: this article hasn’t been written to shame anyone, guilt trip anyone or imply that supporters “should” be attending women’s matches.\n\nFootball fandom is deeply personal, shaped by time, money, geography, habit, identity and emotional bandwidth. People support what they can, when they can, and in ways that make sense for their own lives.\n\nThe intention here isn’t to push an agenda or to suggest that those who don’t attend games any Eppleton are somehow “lesser” supporters. Instead, the aim is to understand the barriers and to consider what might realistically help those who are curious, interested or on the fence as they consider whether to take that next step and give the women’s game a try.\n\nThat distinction matters, because the conversation around women’s football can sometimes slip into moralising — as if attendance is a test of virtue rather than a choice shaped by practical realities.\n\nSunderland supporters are among the most loyal and emotionally invested in the country, but loyalty doesn’t magically overcome bus timetables, childcare, shift work, tight budgets or the simple fact that Hetton isn’t easy to reach. Recognising those realities is not an excuse; instead, it’s the starting point for meaningful improvement.\n\nIf the club wants to grow the women’s fanbase, it must meet people where they are, not where we wish they were, and to their credit, some steps have already been taken.\n\nOne of the most visible improvements at Eppleton has been the upgraded TV gantry, which has significantly improved the quality of live streams and broadcast footage. This might seem like a small detail, but it matters, as better coverage increases visibility, helps to attract new supporters and gives the players the professional platform they deserve. It also signals that the club is willing to invest in the infrastructure around the women’s team — not just the bare minimum required to host matches.\n\nSupporters themselves have also stepped up in ways that deserve recognition.\n\nThe Sunderland Women Supporters Group has spent its own money on flags, banners and visual displays to decorate Eppleton and create a more vibrant, welcoming matchday environment.\n\nThese efforts aren’t cosmetic — they contribute to atmosphere, identity and pride. They make the ground feel lived‑in and loved, and they show new supporters that this is a team with a community behind it. In many ways, the SWSG’s work embodies the spirit of women’s football: grassroots, collaborative, and driven by passion rather than profit.\n\nUltimately, the question of Eppleton versus the Stadium of Light is not a binary choice but a spectrum of possibilities.\n\nThe women’s team doesn’t need to abandon its roots to embrace its future, and nor does it need to cling to tradition at the expense of ambition. What it needs — and what the supporters deserve — is a thoughtful, realistic plan that respects the unique strengths of both venues while addressing the barriers that keep potential fans away.\n\nEppleton will always be part of the story, but it doesn’t have to be the whole story forever.\n\nFor now, the task is simple: make it easier for people to come, make it enjoyable when they do, and make them feel part of something that matters. If the club can do that, with the help of supporters, volunteers, and the wider community, then the question of where Sunderland AFC Women play will eventually answer itself.\n\nGrowth will come not from pressure or guilt, but from connection, curiosity and the quiet, steady pull of a team worth supporting.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are considering appointing a young manager from the Portuguese league to replace Ruben Amorim as INEOS risk learning nothing from the past 14 months, according to a bombshell report.\n\nThe Red Devils dismissed Amorim this morning after internal tensions between with executive branch spilled out into the public following the 1-1 draw with Leeds United.\n\nThe Portuguese coach made his position at Old Trafford untenable after publicly criticising the club – with director of football Jason Wilcox receiving the brunt of his anger.\n\nWith a dreadful record on the pitch, and mounting difficulties off it, INEOS were left with no other decision than to sack Amorim, despite having steadfastly backed him since arrival from Sporting CP.\n\nDarren Fletcher – a former Red Devil and current Under-18’s manager – has taken over the senior side on an interim basis, while a permanent caretaker is sourced to lead the side for the remainder of the season.\n\nBut the search for a long-term replacement for Amorim is already well underway, with host of candidates – inside and outside England – under consideration.\n\nAnd, an an ironic twist, The Telegraph reveals one of the targets is Francisco Farioli – the 36-year-old tactician from Liga Portugal, currently in charge of Porto.\n\nThough Farioli is Italian, he offers many parallels with the coach he would be succeeding in Manchester.\n\nHe is a young manager with a clear philosophy predicated on a high-press and forcing transitions. He is inexperienced, yet confident, with only one season in a top five European league – in charge of OGC Nice in another ironic twist, given INEOS retain sporting control of the Ligue 1 side as well.\n\nTotal Football Analysis explains how the 36-year-old has lifted Porto to the summit of Portuese football.\n\n“Under Farioli tactics, Porto have transformed their build-up from the back into a more structured, positional process.\n\n“The goalkeeper and centre-backs are involved early, with the pivot (No. 6) often dropping between the central defenders to form a back three and create numerical superiority in the first phase of possession, or when one of the full-backs stops with two centre-backs.”\n\nThis is distinct from Amorim’s system – but the parallels of appointing a young coach with virtually no experience at the top level or a familiarity with the rigours of English football should be obvious for United’s rulers.\n\nYet the allure remains, despite the cautionary tale already having played out.\n\nPorto sit atop Liga Portugal without having lost a game (16 wins and one draw). They have scored 34 goals while conceding just four times – a staggering record at the halfway mark of a season. The Dragons are through to the quarter final of the Taça de Portugal and are on track for automatic qualification from the Europa League group phase.\n\nIn short, it has been an outstanding season for a coach in his first season in a new league. Though it is balanced by his previous campaign last year with Ajax, where the Dutch giants surrendered the title to PSV Eindhoven in a heart-breaking final weekend of the Eredivisie.\n\nBut, overall, it’s simply not enough for Farioli to a serious contender to replace Amorim at Old Trafford. It would be too much, too soon, for a coach who should continue his progression in Portugal.\n\nFeatured image Justin Setterfield via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "title": "On This Day (6th Jan 1951): Sunderland Show The Wright Stuff In The Cup!",
    "description": "It was FA Cup third round day at Roker, and Sunderland were keen to do well in the competition!",
    "fullText": "“Close, but not close enough” was the best way to describe Sunderland AFC’s relationship with the FA Cup during the 1950s.\n\nHaving spent boatloads of cash in trying to bring some of the biggest names in the game to Roker, the club were desperate to get their hands on some silverware in return for their investment, and during an era where the cup was arguably seen as the biggest prize of all, knockout football often became the main focus.\n\nCertain members of the team have since mused that it became such a priority that our league form slipped even when the title could’ve been within reach instead, and yet the most the Lads had to show for their efforts were concurrent semi-final appearances in 1955 and 1956.\n\nIt was often claimed that the expensively-assembled side of individuals — whilst boasting eye catching skills and capable of anything on their day — struggled to gel as a unit and was unable to produce any sort of consistency.\n\nThat was perhaps another reason why the FA Cup became the “holy grail”, and it was certainly the case that ties were sometimes viewed as the highlight of the season for supporters. Whether the opposition were familiar foes or unknown qualities from the lower divisions, crowds would still come in their droves and in 1950/1951 alone, Roker Park welcomed three 60,000+ cup gates in less than a month.\n\nThe campaign saw the Sunderland reach the sixth round — their best run since 1938 as holders of the trophy, and the two semi finals that came a couple of years later proved to be the furthest they got in the 1950s. Big numbers flocked in for showpiece games against Southampton, Norwich City and Wolverhampton Wanderers, but before that, the club needed to get past second division Coventry City in front of another healthy attendance.\n\nThe visit of the Sky Blues was only the second home draw since World War II, but they weren’t planning on rolling over for it and their preparations went down to the wire, with Coventry needing to wait as long as possible before naming their team due to a flu bug in the camp and future Sunderland striker Ken Chisholm being one of the men eventually deemed able to play.\n\nThe hosts also needed to get things in order, with rain and thawing frost making the pitch soft and boggy in parts, and in need of a healthy covering of peat moss in the goalmouths.\n\nCoventry more than matched Sunderland in the first half, although both sides struggled with the conditions and greasy ball, which led to some awkward slips and fumbles.\n\nThe two goalkeepers were often forced to punch crosses and shots away instead of attempting to catch them, whilst the referee — acknowledging the treacherous state of the surface — tried to overlook minor fouls in order to help keep the action flowing.\n\nIt all contributed to a frantic tempo and it was only after the break that Bill Murray’s men were able to gain an element of control and start putting their better technical ability to use.\n\nTommy Wright was a persistent threat and five minutes into the second half, he opened the scoring after beating two men on the wing, cutting inside and smashing in a powerful attempt on goal. Although blocked, it fell back to him on the rebound to convert off the underside of the bar and once in front, skipper Willie Watson was able to begin pulling the strings and force Coventry back.\n\nWith their defending becoming more ragged, it was hard for the visitors to get out of their own half and the desperation was never more apparent than with ten minutes to go, when a Dickie Davis header was handled by Terry Springthorpe in the penalty area.\n\nWright took the subsequent penalty and appeared to have struck it well, but the effort was still repelled by a magnificent save from Alf Wood. The stopper had been increasingly busy in the closing stages and deserved his moment of glory, although it wasn’t long until he was beaten again anyway, Arthur Wright doing the business this time as he drove the ball in from out wide.\n\nThere was a touch of fortune about the goal as Arthur Wright could’ve conceivably been looking to put the ball into a dangerous area, and it certainly took at least one deflection before finding its way over the line, but either way, the final score felt right on the balance of play.\n\nCoventry had by no means showed themselves up, but the Black Cats had grown stronger as things went on and were now in the hat for the eagerly anticipated next round.\n\nSunderland 2 (T. Wright 50’, A. Wright 87’)\n\nSunderland: Mapson, Hedley, Hudgell; Watson, Walsh, A Wright; T Wright, Davis, Ford; Broadis, Duns",

    "fullText": "Dozens of skaters have flocked to The Fens from far and wide after word got out that flooded fields had frozen over.\n\nCompetitive skating began in the watery landscape in 1879 and since then it has become a magnet for lovers of \"natural ice\".\n\nFen skating takes place when a field floods and then freezes over, so the ice is very shallow, in places just a few centimetres, unlike frozen lakes.\n\nPeter Riches, 24, a Team GBR short track skater who came from Nottingham to try out his blades at Welney, on the Norfolk/Cambridgeshire border, said: \"We all made the trip over - we all kind of flock here from various parts of the country.\"\n\nWord got out at the weekend that the Fens were freezing and with the cold snap due to last, many more are expected to make the pilgrimage to the wide open spaces.\n\nCompetitive skater Riches said: \"You just have to make sure that you respect the ice - I don't think you're ever going to tame the ice.\n\n\"You can go as fast as you like.\n\n\"This feels more natural, more organic. This is what I call real skating\n\n\"That's what the sport is all about; that's how it started; that's the tradition.\n\n\"It's a challenge, there are little obstacles you have to avoid, but as much as it's a challenge, it's more like a treat.\"\n\nCambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service has warned people to stay off frozen lakes after reports of youngsters playing on them at the weekend.\n\nHowever, those involved in skating on the Fenland fields are quick to point out how shallow the frozen water they use is.\n\n\"This is completely different to a lake,\" said Hew Williams, short track director at British Ice Skating.\n\n\"Here we've got naturally flooded farmland that's unique to this area of Britain and... there's no flowing water underneath. This is still water that's frozen and it needs to be frozen thick enough to actually be able to skate on.\n\n\"On lakes, on rivers, the speed of the water stops the ice from freezing thick enough so that's what's unique here.\"\n\nHe said the maximum depth of the water under the ice was about a foot, or shin-deep.\n\nLaura Upton drove to Welney from Wisbech in Cambridgshire with her two sons when she heard \"on the grapevine\" about the ice.\n\nHer father used to sell skates and she has been Fen skating for about 45 years, since she was five.\n\n\"We definitely have to make the most of it on a beautiful sunny day like today,\" she said.\n\n\"We used to roller speed-skate throughout the year to try to be ready for the ice when it used to come.\n\n\"It's great to keep the traditions going; it's a bit of a natural phenomenon and we're very lucky.\"\n\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.\n\nIn pictures: Snow in the East amid weather warning\n\nDo not play on frozen lakes, warns fire service\n\nSkaters make most of frozen fields\n\n'Fen skating is a great metaphor for life'\n\n'Miracle' black-tailed godwits fly home\n\nMigrating birds caught in cold snap",

    "description": "The organization planted seeds of doubt about the Browns’ answer to the most impactful position in sports.\nNeither GM Andrew Berry nor team owner Jimmy Haslam endorsed Sanders as their 2026 answer.",
    "fullText": "On a day when the Cleveland Browns knew fans wanted answers and accountability, team brass didn’t hide the direction the franchise must go.\n\n“The offense, it’s no secret that’s where we’re going to invest most of our resources this offseason,” general manager Andrew Berry said.\n\nTeam owner Jimmy Haslam agreed that “we have a lot of work to do on the roster, particularly on the offensive side of the roster.”\n\nThat neither man crowned any quarterback on their roster as the 2026 leader was telling — not because Shedeur Sanders, Dillon Gabriel and Deshaun Watson have no chance, but because it is clear that none of them has a guarantee.\n\nA new head coach will arrive in Cleveland soon, after the Browns fired Kevin Stefanski after six seasons featured a 45-56 (.446) regular-season record.\n\nThat coach will have meaningful say on who starts at quarterback for the Browns next season and what will be most highly valued at the position.\n\n[Get more Browns news: Cleveland team feed]\n\nThat the Browns will hire an offensive-minded head coach to develop that quarterback is no guarantee: The job will be “to make sure that the offense is run and developed well,” Berry said, “as opposed to necessarily having to be the person that directly does it.”\n\nBut losing, particularly in three- and five-win seasons the last two years, cost Stefanski his job. And the Browns know that finding a lasting quarterback answer is the No. 1 factor that will correlate with turning around their win total.\n\nNo one is saying aloud that Sanders, Gabriel and Watson cannot be the answer. But the organization planted seeds of doubt Monday about the Browns’ answer to the most impactful position in sports.\n\nNeither Berry nor Haslam endorsed Sanders, their starter to end the season, as their 2026 answer. The next head coach will have a say, and Sanders himself acknowledged that “when it comes to those grown-up decisions that’s not me.”\n\nWhat the Browns do know, and were willing to say, is that they need an answer quickly.\n\n“At the end of the day, the National Football League is a quarterback league, right?” seven-time Pro Bowl left guard Joel Bitonio said. “If you have an elite quarterback in this league, it allows you to be a little bit more sustained in your success. And it's not me saying like, ‘Do we know if Shedeur or Dillon or Deshaun or Bailey [Zappe], any of these guys is that guy,’ right?\n\n“We have those guys in our locker room. But until you have a guy that can stay healthy and can be on the field and be that guy for your team, it's hard to have that sustained success. …\n\n“Until you find one that's stable and can lead your team, it's going to be hard to not ride the roller coaster of wins and losses.”\n\nThe Browns do not regret that they evaluated and practiced with four quarterbacks during the offseason and training camp.\n\nConsidering depth was not the problem. Missing on a higher ceiling was.\n\n“We believe in competition in every room on the roster, and quarterback’s no different,” Berry said. “Quarterback is the most important position in sports. We all know that. And part of the equation with quarterback is the evaluation part. Part of it is the development part as well.”\n\nThe Browns traded away the second overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft rather than spend a premium pick on quarterback as some expected. Later in the draft, they selected two quarterbacks — Gabriel in the third round followed by Sanders in the fifth. It was a curious move. And yet, Berry believes philosophically in expending significant resources at quarterback.\n\n“I wouldn't necessarily say draft a quarterback every year, I don't believe it being that,” Berry told Yahoo Sports last June from minicamp. “But if you're in position to make a bet on a quarterback that you think can be a quality starter or some level of high-level proficiency, understand that it's not always going to pan out. That's a bet you should be making because you just never know.”\n\nThe philosophy suggests the Browns will not stay put at quarterback this spring, the question of their acquisition more a question of how rather than if. In their 2025 season, the Browns recognized their transitional stage and built up the roster at some positions. But while their defense posted its second top-five unit in three years, the Browns’ offense ranked bottom-five in offense for the second straight season.\n\nA year after ranking last in scoring, the Browns ranked second-to-last this year. In what Berry and Haslam described as a year of roster “transition,” the franchise evaluated its rookies at length.\n\nThe Browns won three of Sanders’ seven games compared to one of Gabriel's six, wins often considered the “most important” quarterback statistic. In traditional quarterback stats, their performance was mixed.\n\nSanders averaged 193 passing yards per start compared to Gabriel’s 153, while completing 59.5% of his attempts to Gabriel’s 58.9%. But Sanders’ 0.8 touchdown-to-interception ratio (seven touchdowns, nine interceptions in seven games) paled in comparison to Gabriel’s 3.0 (six touchdowns to two interceptions in six games). Sanders’ 72.9 passer rating trailed Gabriel’s 78.9.\n\nSanders earned the right to continue starting and warranting evaluation through season’s end. But with below-league-average metrics, the Browns are not saying right now that he’s earned the right to start next season.\n\n“We saw a lot of progress with Shedeur this year,” Berry said. “I think that’s both mentally, physically, playing the position. He’s still very much a work in progress like many rookie quarterbacks are. But I think we saw some really good things in terms of his playmaking, his accuracy, his ability to extend [plays] with his feet. And I think I’d also give him credit as well as our offensive staff for bringing him along in terms of his pocket management, his situational awareness and things of that nature.\n\n“Now that all being said, we’re going to do our work on the quarterback market. It’s too important of a position and it’s something that has to be solidified. I can’t sit here and tell you today, you know, whether the solution for or the starter in 2026 is internal or external. But it’s something that we’re going to work through over the next several weeks. And quite honestly, the new head coach will also have a lot of input into that as well.”\n\nPerhaps the best thing the Browns can do for their quarterback future is hire the coach they best believe will lead their organization, independent of any single quarterback style.\n\nBerry acknowledged that “schemes, they really do come and go.” An NFC assistant coach whose team helped their quarterback rebound after a coaching change felt no single schematic factor was the answer in their club.\n\n“I think they just need to find the best coach possible,” the assistant told Yahoo Sports. “You just need to hire the best guy for each job of the organization vs. being predetermined to get a QB guru or whatever you think you need stylistically.\n\n“That way you’re able to pivot if it turns out [the quarterback] isn’t the guy, but at least you hired the right coach.”\n\nThis year’s sophomore quarterback class is evidence of that.\n\nSetting a historic pace, teams selected six quarterbacks in the first 12 picks of the 2024 NFL Draft. Second overall pick Jayden Daniels took the Commanders to the NFC Championship game in his first season under center. This year, three more 2024 quarterbacks have led their teams to a playoff berth.\n\nSelected at first, third and 12th respectively, Caleb Williams, Drake Maye and Bo Nix vary in style and NFL early-career experience. While Nix arrived to an organization with coaching stability, receiving play calls from Super Bowl-winning Sean Payton, his counterparts each entered Year 2 with a new head coach. Their two coaching résumés differ vastly, Ben Johnson a first-time head coach who’s calling offensive plays while Mike Vrabel is a second-time head coach calling plays on neither side of the ball.\n\nAnd yet, talent evaluators around the league look at each of their stories and see the success stemming from coach at least as much as quarterback. The “right” coach was hired. Neither his quality or quantity of experience determined whether he was the right coach.\n\nFinding Mr. Right will be Berry’s job in the coming weeks, after which the group will decide how and with whom they want to augment the quarterback room. Doing nothing, while currently on track for a host of 2026 draft picks, including the sixth overall as well as a late first-round selection, would be shocking.\n\nWhile free agency is always an option, 12 of the 14 starting quarterbacks in this year’s postseason were selected in the first round. Three are no longer with the team that initially drafted them, a reminder of success teams have had in recent years finding quarterbacks via trade or free agency.\n\nThat history may be a tell for the Browns brass’s next move. And it may be a tell of Sanders’ chance at keeping his starting job through 2026. Fifth-round quarterbacks face uphill battles. So do quarterbacks selected before a coach had input in that decision.\n\n“I think overall, like as a quarterback, I showed different pieces in different games to all add up to one complete quarterback,” Sanders said. “And that’s what I had to get to in those situations — red-zone situations, field-goal situations, third-down situations, ‘where you at on the field’ situations. So, it was a lot of situations that was good. I feel like this was a good learning year for me, and I’m excited for it. Because like I say, like moving forward I’ll be prepared.\n\n“I did what I was able to do, and I definitely grew from a lot of things. And I got experience now. So, I’m always the same: confidence-wise, I’m there. But like, that’s not in my hands. Like, that’s not my decision.\n\n“I can’t speak on what other people feel.”",

    "description": "The Lakers will reportedly be judicious when it comes to whom they may agree to trade for in the coming weeks.",
    "fullText": "The NBA's trade deadline is exactly one month away, and it has become beyond clear that the Los Angeles Lakers will need to make at least one deal before that deadline if they are to have any real shot at winning this season's NBA championship.\n\nThey have a strong core centered around Luka Doncic, LeBron James and Austin Reaves, as well as a few very solid non-stars and role players. But they could use one or two more role players or \"connector\" players who possess plenty of athleticism and are capable of providing above-average defense and high-accuracy 3-point shooting.\n\nRight now, they lack tradable assets, but on draft day, they will be able to trade up to three first-round draft picks, including their 2026 first-rounder, once they use it on draft day. They should also have a lot more financial flexibility once the new league year arrives since several players' contracts will expire, including that of James, who will make $52.6 million this season.\n\nInsider Marc Stein wrote on his Substack that Los Angeles is willing to sacrifice that flexibility if it acquires a player who will move the needle right now.\n\n\"League sources say that the Lakers continue to scour the trade market in hopes of acquiring a two-way wing with size before the Feb. 5 trade deadline,\" Stein wrote.\n\n\"Two factors, though, continue to work against a trade.\n\n\"1) The market for such wings who can shoot from distance and defend remains quite limited, with New Orleans still resistant to trade interest in both Herb Jones and Trey Murphy III.\n\n\"2) It’s believed that the Lakers are only going to sacrifice their projected financial flexibility in the summer — which is expected to furnish them with the ability to make significant roster changes — only if they can acquire a real needle-mover at the position. Will such a player actually become available over the next four weeks and change?\"\n\nLakers fans are holding out hope that the team can swing a trade for future Hall of Famer Giannis Antetokounmpo sometime between now and the start of next season. But it is unknown how serious L.A. is about trying to land him, or if he would even be available or want to play for the Purple and Gold.\n\nSince such a trade may be unrealistic, the best fans can hope for may be a trade for one or two players who will upgrade the roster in terms of athleticism, defense and 3-point shooting. But that just may be enough to put the Lakers over the top.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers would only sacrifice financial flexibility for 'needle-mover'",

    "description": "NASA and Roscosmos continue to monitor and investigate the previously observed cracks.\"",
    "fullText": "A small section of the International Space Station that has experienced persistent leaks for years appears to have stopped venting atmosphere into space.\n\nThe leaks were caused by microscopic structural cracks inside the small PrK module on the Russian segment of the space station, which lies between a Progress spacecraft airlock and the Zvezda module. The problem has been a long-running worry for Russian and US operators of the station, especially after the rate of leakage doubled in 2024. This prompted NASA officials to label the leak as a “high likelihood” and “high consequence” risk.\n\nHowever, recently two sources indicated that the leaks have stopped. And NASA has now confirmed this.\n\n“Following additional inspections and sealing activities, the pressure in the transfer tunnel attached to the Zvezda Service Module of the International Space Station, known as the PrK, is holding steady in a stable configuration,” a space agency spokesman, Josh Finch, told Ars. “NASA and Roscosmos continue to monitor and investigate the previously observed cracks for any future changes that may occur.”\n\nFor the better part of half a decade, Russian cosmonauts have been searching for the small leaks like a proverbial needle in a haystack. They would periodically close the hatch leading to the PrK module and then, upon re-opening it, look for tiny accumulations of dust to indicate the leak sites.\n\nThen the Russian cosmonauts would apply a sealant known as Germetall-1 (which has now been patented) to the cracks. They would close the hatch again, monitor the pressure inside the PrK module, and begin the search anew for additional leaks. This process went on for years.\n\nTheir success with the long-running leak problem probably will not prevent new leaks from developing in the decades-old hardware. The Zvezda module was launched a quarter of a century ago, in July 2000, on a Russian Proton rocket. The cracking issue first appeared in 2019, and despite the long-running investigations, its precise cause remains unknown. But this is a nice win in space for both Russia and NASA.\n\nThere is other potential good news on the horizon regarding Russia’s civil space program. This involves the country’s primary launch pad for getting people and cargo to the International Space Station.\n\nThe problems there occurred when a Soyuz rocket launched Roscosmos cosmonauts Sergei Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikayev, as well as NASA astronaut Christopher Williams, on an eight-month mission to the International Space Station in late November. The rocket had no difficulties, but a large mobile platform below the rocket was not properly secured prior to the launch and crashed into the flame trench below, taking the pad offline.\n\nIt is unclear when the pad, Site 31 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, will come back online.\n\nRussia had been targeting a return-to-flight mission in March 2026. NASA now appears to believe that. The US space agency’s internal schedule, which was recently updated, has the next Progress spacecraft launch set for March 22, followed by another Progress mission on April 26. The next Soyuz crewed mission, MS-29, remains scheduled for July 14th. This flight will carry NASA astronaut Anil Menon to the space station.",

    "fullText": "The Star Gauge (Chinese: 璇璣圖; pinyin: Xuánjī Tú), or translated as \"the armillary sphere chart\", is the posthumous title given to a 4th-century Classical Chinese poem written by the Former Qin poet Su Hui for her husband during the Sixteen Kingdoms period. It consists of a 29 by 29 grid of characters, forming a reversible poem that can be read in different ways to form roughly 3,000 smaller rhyming poems.[1] The outer border forms a single circular poem, thought to be both the first and the longest of its kind.\n\nThe Star Gauge consists of 841 characters in a grid. The original was described by contemporary sources as shuttle-woven on brocade. It was composed by Su Hui during a time when East Asian Mādhyamaka was one of the predominant philosophical schools in the area.[2]\n\nThe outer border is meant to be read in a circle. The grid is known as a palindrome poem, and can be read in different ways to generate over 3,000 shorter poems, in which the second line of every couplet rhymes with that of the next.[1] The largest set of such poems are 2,848 four-liners with seven characters per line. In the image below, the maroon grid is made up of 32 seven-character phrases. These may be read in certain patterns around the perimeter, and in other patterns for the internal grid.[1] Other poems can be formed by reading characters from the other colored sections.\n\n琴清流楚激弦商秦曲發聲悲摧藏音和詠思惟空堂心憂增慕懷慘傷仁\n芳廊東步階西遊王姿淑窈窕伯邵南周風興自后妃荒經離所懷歎嗟智\n蘭休桃林陰翳桑懷歸思廣河女衛鄭楚樊厲節中闈淫遐曠路傷中情懷\n凋翔飛燕巢雙鳩土迤逶路遐志詠歌長嘆不能奮飛妄清幃房君無家德\n茂流泉清水激揚眷頎其人碩興齊商雙發歌我袞衣想華飾容朗鏡明聖\n熙長君思悲好仇舊蕤葳桀翠榮曜流華觀冶容為誰感英曜珠光紛葩虞\n陽愁嘆發容摧傷鄉悲情我感傷情徵宮羽同聲相追所多思感誰為榮唐\n春方殊離仁君榮身苦惟艱生患多殷憂纏情將如何欽蒼穹誓終篤志貞\n牆禽心濱均深身加懷憂是嬰藻文繁虎龍寧自感思岑形熒城榮明庭妙\n面伯改漢物日我兼思何漫漫榮曜華雕旌孜孜傷情幽未猶傾苟難闈顯\n殊在者之品潤乎愁苦艱是丁麗壯觀飾容側君在時岩在炎在不受亂華\n意誠惑步育浸集悴我生何冤充顏曜繡衣夢想勞形峻慎盛戒義消作重\n感故暱飄施愆殃少章時桑詩端無終始詩仁顏貞寒嵯深興後姬源人榮\n故遺親飄生思愆精徽盛醫風比平始璇情賢喪物歲峨慮漸孽班禍讒章\n新舊聞離天罪辜神恨昭盛興作蘇心璣明別改知識深微至嬖女因奸臣\n霜廢遠微地積何遐微業孟鹿麗氏詩圖顯行華終凋淵察大趙婕所佞賢\n水故離隔德怨因幽元傾宣鳴辭理興義怨士容始松重遠伐氏好恃兇惟\n齊君殊喬貴其備曠悼思傷懷日往感年衰念是舊愆涯禍用飛辭恣害聖\n傑子我木平根當遠嘆水感悲思憂遠勞情誰為獨居經在昭燕輦極我配\n志惟同誰均難苦離戚戚情哀慕歲殊嘆時賤女懷歡網防青實漢驕忠英\n清新衾陰勻尋辛鳳知我者誰世異浮寄傾鄙賤何如羅萌青生成盈貞皇\n純貞志一專所當麟沙流頹逝異浮沉華英翳曜潛陽林西昭景薄榆桑倫\n望微精感通明神龍馳若然倏逝惟時年殊白日西移光滋愚讒漫頑凶匹\n誰雲浮寄身輕飛昭虧不盈無倏必盛有衰無日不陂流蒙謙退休孝慈離\n思輝光飭桀殊文德離忠體一達心意志殊憤激何施電疑危遠家和雍飄\n想群離散妾孤遺懷儀容仰俯榮華麗飾身將無誰為逝容節敦貞淑思浮\n懷悲哀聲殊乖分聖貲何情憂感惟哀志節上通神祇推持所貞記自恭江\n所春傷應翔雁歸皇辭成者作體下遺葑菲採者無差生從是敬孝為基湘\n親剛柔有女為賤人房幽處己憫微身長路悲曠感生民梁山殊塞隔河津\n\nEarly sources focused on the circular poem composing the outer border of the grid, consisting of 112 characters. Later sources described the whole grid of 840 characters (not counting the central character 心 xin, meaning \"heart\", which lends meaning to the whole but is not part of any of the smaller poems).\n\nThe text of the poem was circulated continuously in medieval China and was never lost, but during the Song dynasty it became scarce. The 112-character version was included in early sources. The earliest surviving excerpts of the entire grid version date from a 10th-century text by Li Fang.\n\nWhile sources agree that Su was a talented poet, the background story and interpretation of the poem changed over the centuries, from the lament of a wife longing for her husband, to a wife worrying about her husband fighting on the frontier, to a jealous wife competing for her husband's affections.[4]\n\nDou Tao of Qinzhou was exiled to the desert, away from his wife Lady Su. Upon departure from Su, Dou swore that he would not marry another person. However, as soon as he arrived in the desert region, he married someone. Lady Su composed a circular poem, wove it into a piece of brocade, and sent it to him.[6]\n\nAnother source, naming the poem as Xuanji Tu (Picture of the Turning Sphere), claimed that the grid as a whole was a palindromic poem comprehensible only to Dou (which would explain why none of the Tang sources reprinted it), and that when he read it, he left his desert wife and returned to Su Hui.[7]\n\nSome 13th-century copies were attributed to famous women of the Song dynasty, but falsely so.[8] The poem was also mentioned in the novel Flowers in the Mirror.",

    "fullText": "I need to confess something embarrassing. I can't finish reading articles anymore.\n\nI don't mean I choose not to. I mean I physically cannot. My brain won't let me.\n\nIt wasn't always like this. In my twenties, I was the guy who read everything. Long investigative pieces, academic papers, entire book chapters in one sitting. Reading was my identity. I was proud of it.\n\nThen somewhere around 32 or 33, something broke.\n\nI remember the exact moment I realized how bad it had gotten.\n\nI was at a dinner party at Christmas. Someone brought up an article about AI that had been making the rounds – you know the type, one of those big think pieces everyone was talking about. The whole table had opinions. They quoted specific paragraphs. They debated the author's conclusions.\n\nI had opened that same article three separate times that week. I never made it past the third paragraph.\n\nI just nodded along, pretending I'd read it, feeling like a fraud. On the drive home, I sat in my car in the garage for ten minutes, staring at the steering wheel, wondering what was wrong with me.\n\nIt got worse. I started avoiding articles entirely because opening them meant facing another failure.\n\nMy \"Read Later\" list became a graveyard – 2,000+ articles I'd never touch. Every time I saw that number, I felt a little more pathetic.\n\nMy wife would send me articles with \"you'll love this!\" and I'd respond with a thumbs up emoji, never actually reading them. Weeks later she'd ask what I thought, and I'd have to admit I never got to it. The disappointment in her eyes. That quiet \"oh.\" It killed me every time.\n\nMy colleagues would reference blog posts in meetings and I'd nod knowingly, having only read the headline. Sometimes I'd get called on to give an opinion, and I'd have to bullshit my way through, praying no one would ask follow-up questions.\n\nI started wondering if this was just aging. Maybe this is what happens in your mid-30s. Maybe I'd peaked intellectually and this was the long, slow decline. I genuinely believed that for a while.\n\nIt's a dark place, thinking you're getting dumber and there's nothing you can do about it.\n\nHere's what made me feel truly broken. I could scroll social media for hours with zero effort. Twitter threads, Reddit comments, YouTube shorts, TikTok – all completely effortless. My brain devoured that garbage happily.\n\nBut ask me to read something that actually mattered? Something that might make me smarter, more informed, a better person? Impossible.\n\nI felt like a lab rat, programmed to seek the easiest dopamine hit. Like I'd lost control of my own mind. Like the version of me who used to read Cosmos by Carl Sagan for fun was dead, replaced by this hollow, distracted shell.\n\nSome nights I'd lie awake wondering. 'Is this who I am now? Forever?'\n\nOne night – 2am, couldn't sleep, lying in bed doom-scrolling (the irony wasn't lost on me) – I came across an article about attention and the modern web. Ironically, I couldn't finish it either. But I read enough, luckily.\n\nThe article argued that our brains aren't broken. The web is.\n\nModern articles are designed by teams of people whose job is to maximize \"engagement metrics.\" Scroll depth. Time on page. Ad impressions. Click-through rates. Everything around the content – sidebars, related articles, social buttons, newsletter popups, comment sections, auto-playing videos – is optimized to pull our attention away from what we came to read.\n\nThe content itself is often padded with filler to hit word count targets. Paragraphs are written to be skimmed, not absorbed. Headlines are designed to be shared, not understood.\n\nWe're not failing to read. We're fighting an environment that's engineered to prevent deep reading.\n\nThat reframe hit me hard. What if I wasn't broken? What if I'd just been blaming myself for losing a fight that was rigged from the start?\n\nThat night, still unable to sleep, I opened my laptop and started coding.\n\nParsely is stupidly simple. When you click the extension icon (or press Ctrl+Shift+R), the entire webpage fades away. It blurs and darkens into the background. In the center of your screen appears a single, beautifully formatted paragraph.\n\nJust that paragraph. Nothing else.\n\nYou read it. You press the arrow key or spacebar. The next paragraph slides in. The previous one fades but stays visible above, grayed out, so you don't lose context. Below, you can see a hint of what's coming next.\n\nIt's like reading a book, but on the web. One thought at a time.\n\nNo sidebars. No popups. No \"\n\nI was skeptical it would make any difference. I'd tried so many things. But the first time I used it, I read an entire 4,000-word essay about urban planning. The whole thing. Without stopping. Without checking my phone. Without that familiar urge to escape.\n\nWhen I finished, I just sat there for a moment. I felt... proud? It sounds pathetic, but finishing an article had become so rare that it felt like an accomplishment.\n\nI've been using Parsely daily for months now. Last week I read a 6,000-word piece about AI energy policy – dense, technical, important. I not only finished it, I took notes. I remembered it well enough to discuss it intelligently the next day. I felt like my old self again.\n\nHere's what I didn't anticipate. It changed more than just my reading.\n\nMy wife sent me an article last month. I actually read it. The whole thing. That night, we talked about it over dinner for an hour. She looked at me differently – like she was seeing the person she married again. That meant more to me than I can express.\n\nAt work, I'm contributing to discussions again. Not bullshitting, actually contributing. Referencing things I've read, understood, and thought about. The impostor syndrome is fading.\n\nI'm reading books again. Actual books. My attention span is slowly healing, paragraph by paragraph.\n\nI don't think I was broken. I think I was a normal human being, fighting an unfair fight against a system designed to fragment my attention. And I think a lot of people are in the same boat, quietly blaming themselves, just like I was.\n\nI debated whether to post this. It's embarrassing to admit how much I was struggling with something that sounds so simple. \"Just read the article, dude.\"\n\nBut I keep meeting people who describe the exact same thing. The shame. The avoidance. The feeling that something is wrong with them. And I wonder how many people are suffering in silence, never realizing that the problem might not be them at all.\n\nSo here it is. A tool born from my own frustration, my own shame, my own 2am desperation. Maybe it'll help someone else too.\n\nIf any of this resonates, give Parsely a try. And if you have ideas for making it better, I'd genuinely love to hear them. I'm building this for people like me, which means I'm building it for people like you.\n\nInstall Parsely and try it on your next article. It's free, forever.",

    "fullText": "I recently came across a cute game called https://enclose.horse. In this game, there is a horse in the middle of a field and a bunch of rivers surrounding it. You have to \"enclose\" the horse by cutting off its access to the boundaries of the map using a limited set of walls. The game is to create the largest possible space you can under those constraints. It's harder to explain in words than if you just go try the game.\n\nWhat the game is asking you to do, in graph theory terms, is to find a vertex cut that maximizes the number of vertices on a particular side of the cut. A vertex cut is a set of vertices that separates two other sets of vertices. In this image, the set W separates the sets A and B:\n\nIn the horse game, A is the square that the horse stands on, B is the set of edge tiles, and there are edges between any two adjacent grass tiles. We are picking a set W when we place walls as we try to find a set that the horse would have to pass through in order to escape.\n\nIn school I had the thought that in general, solving computationally difficult problems was probably a good basis for constructing puzzle games. I don't think I was right in general, since my \"minimal vertex cover\" game was not particularly fun. But I think this game is pretty fun overall! And the presentation is cute and good.\n\nAs an armchair game designer, I'm obligated to weigh in that I think this kind of game (including stuff like Wordle and my personal favourite catfishing) would be dramatically improved design-wise by the inclusion of a timer. I think balance-wise (\"balance\" perhaps not in the sense of like, \"game balance\" but in the sense of, \"the composition of the elements of design being in harmony\" sense), the strategy of \"spending a really, really long time thinking about it\" is much too strong and not that much fun, and negates a lot of strategies one might otherwise develop to quickly identify possible solutions and learn more about the underlying problem structure. I recognize that this kind of element would probably make for a less popular game, but I think it would make for a more sound game.\n\nAnyway. Playing this game made me think about a cool theorem from graph theory that is a useful such strategy for quickly convincing yourself of certain facts about the playing field. Go play the game first, and then come back, so I don't have to explain in more detail how it works.\n\nMenger's Theorem says that in a graph, the number of vertices you need to delete to disconnect two vertices is equal to the number of disjoint paths between those vertices. By disjoint paths I mean paths that connect A and B and don't share any vertices (besides those in A and B).\n\nOne direction of Menger's theorem, that you need to delete at least as many vertices as disjoint paths, is very easy. The other direction is harder and more surprising.\n\nSpecifically the yellow exit. It's probably not too hard to convince yourself with some trial and error that it's not possible to block that exit off from the red zone with fewer than three walls, but we can use the easy direction of Menger's theorem to prove it quickly and easily by finding three disjoint paths from the red zone to the exit:\n\nThese three paths constitute a proof that you need at least three walls to block that exit off.\n\nHowever, since we can block off the horse specifically from going that way with only two walls:\n\nMenger's theorem tells us that there are at most two disjoint paths from the horse to the exit (going that way, we can actually walk around in this particular map.\n\nTools like this are why I think this kind of game would benefit from a stricter time limit: building up these quick heuristics is fun! And can let you quickly prune parts of the search space without having to do an exhaustive search. But without a time limit, become a bit less useful, since doing things quickly is not especially valuable. I'd like to see future games of this nature explore this sort of thing a bit more.",

    "fullText": "Leaders of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private agency that has steered federal funding to PBS, NPR and hundreds of public television and radio stations across the country, voted Monday to dissolve the organization that was created in 1967.\n\nCPB had been winding down since Congress acted last summer to defund its operations at the encouragement of President Donald Trump. Its board of directors chose Monday to shutter CPB completely instead of keeping it in existence as a shell.\n\n“CPB’s final act would be to protect the integrity of the public media system and the democratic values by dissolving, rather than allowing the organization to remain defunded and vulnerable to additional attacks,” said Patricia Harrison, the organization’s president and CEO.\n\nMany Republicans have long accused public broadcasting, particularly its news programming, of being biased toward liberals but it wasn’t until the second Trump administration —- with full GOP control of Congress — that those criticisms were turned into action.\n\nRuby Calvert, head of CPB’s board of directors, said the federal defunding of public media has been devastating.\n\n“Even at this moment, I am convinced that public media will survive, and that a new Congress will address public media’s role in our country because it is critical to our children’s education, our history, culture and democracy to do so,” Calvert said.\n\nCPB said it was financially supporting the American Archive of Public Broadcasting in its effort to preserve historic content, and is working with the University of Maryland to maintain its own records.",

    "fullText": "@pierre/diffs is an open source diff and code rendering library. It's built on Shiki for syntax highlighting and theming, is super customizable, and comes packed with features. Made with love by The Pierre Computer Company.\n\nChoose from stacked (unified) or split (side-by-side). Both use CSS Grid and Shadow DOM under the hood, meaning fewer DOM nodes and faster rendering.\n\nWe built @pierre/diffs on top of Shiki for syntax highlighting and general theming. Our components automatically adapt to blend in with your theme selection, including across color modes.\n\nLove the Pierre themes? Install our Pierre VS Code Theme pack with light and dark flavors.\n\nYour diffs, your choice. Render changed lines with classic diff indicators (+/–), full-width background colors, or vertical bars. You can even highlight inline changes—character or word based—and toggle line wrapping, hide numbers, and more.\n\n@pierre/diffs adapts to any font, font-size, line-height, and even font-feature-settings you may have set. Configure font options with your preferred CSS method globally or on a per-component basis.\n\nUse renderHeaderMetadata to inject custom content and components into the file header. Perfect for adding view toggles, theme switchers, copy buttons, or any other file-level actions while preserving the built-in header.\n\n@pierre/diffs provide a flexible annotation framework for injecting additional content and context. Use it to render your own line comments, annotations from CI jobs, and other third-party content.\n\nShould we validate the role parameter? We could restrict it to a set of allowed values.\n\nGood idea, maybe use a Literal type or an enum.\n\nAgreed, we should also update verify_token to return the role.\n\nAnnotations can also be used to build interactive code review interfaces similar to AI-assisted coding tools like Cursor. Use it to track the state of each change, inject custom UI like accept/reject buttons, and provide immediate visual feedback.\n\nTurn on line selection with enableLineSelection: true. When enabled, clicking a line number will select that line. Click and drag to select multiple lines, or hold Shift and click to extend your selection. You can also control the selection programmatically. Also selections will elegantly manage the differences between split and unified views.\n\nIn addition to rendering standard Git diffs and patches, you can pass any two files in @pierre/diffs and get a diff between them. This is especially useful when comparing across generative snapshots where linear history isn't always available. Edit the css below to see the diff.\n\nOur team has decades of cumulative experience in open source, developer tools, and more. We’ve worked on projects like Coinbase, GitHub, Bootstrap, Twitter, Medium, and more. This stuff is our bread and butter, and we’re happy to share it with you.",

    "fullText": "Olive farmers in Syria are facing one of their worst harvest seasons ever. Changing weather patterns and a prolonged conflict have affected crop yields, threatening food security and driving food prices up.\n\nSyria was a major global olive producer prior to the civil war that began in 2011.\n\nAccording to the Arab Reform Initiative, the country had more than 79 million olive trees, producing about 1.1 million tons of olives. Daraa province was home to more than 6.5 million olive trees that spanned up to 30,000 hectares, according to The Syrian Observer.\n\nAt the start of the war, olive production in Daraa stood at 75,800 tons per year, per Syria Direct. During the conflict, this number declined as olive farmers were forced to abandon their trees and farmland in search of safety. By 2022, olive production in Daraa had reached a low of 22,300 tons annually, a 70% decline.\n\nThough data shows that olive production had been steadily rising since 2022, this past harvest season, cursed with the country's worst drought in over four decades, became the lowest yield on record.\n\nIn 2025, olive farmers in Daraa produced only 10,000 tons of olives — a 68% reduction compared to yields in 2024.\n\n\"The current season is one of the worst in more than 20 years. The yield per olive tree has dropped by half compared to last year,\" said Muawiya al-Zoubi, an olive farmer in eastern Daraa, per Syria Direct.\n\nOlive trees are native to Syria.\n\nNative plants have generally adapted to local climates and are drought-tolerant because of their root systems, which allow them to source water and nutrients from deep underground.\n\nHowever, this year's olive yields suggest that the extreme drought that hit Syria and surrounding countries was so severe that even native plants struggled to survive.\n\nWhat is the biggest reason you don't grow food at home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nDroughts and other extreme weather events, including flash floods and monsoons, have devastated farmers globally.\n\nAlmond production in Portugal fell 85% because of heavy rainfall, for example. A historic drought in Vermont drastically reduced corn production. Farmers in India faced the worst monsoon in the last 45 years, damaging major crops such as grapes.\n\nCrop losses not only threaten food availability for local communities, but they also increase the production costs for farmers. This increased cost is passed on to consumers via inflated grocery prices.\n\nChanging weather conditions and rising temperatures have large impacts on crop production, underscoring the importance of adopting climate-resilient agricultural practices.\n\nThough extreme weather conditions are not easily predictable, trends show that these devastating events are becoming more frequent and intense. The agricultural industry must adapt to protect the global food supply.\n\nWatermelon farmers in Florida have employed automatic irrigation systems that keep their fields watered without wasting any of the vital resource. The technology, which serves over 1,883 acres of farmland, has saved more than 165 million gallons of water compared to traditional irrigation systems.\n\nResearchers in Kenya have developed a mobile solar irrigation system that supplies farmers with water in dry climates. This development allows farmers to protect their crops without having to drastically change infrastructure to support additional irrigation.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

Most of the last holdouts at the mall have already closed or plan to this month, including Shake Shack, Aritzia, H&M and GNC.\n\nThe mall's death spiral started after the pandemic and remote work devastated foot traffic in the Powell Street area, leading to the closures of anchor tenants Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's.\n\nBrokerage CBRE has now been hired to sell the mall again, but real estate experts have said that any reimagining of the property into another usage could be prohibitively expensive.

It first released the GPU at the beginning of 2021. The leaker Hongxing2020 indicates that NVIDIA will resume production of the 3060 sometime in the next few months.\n\nWhy is the world's most valuable company reportedly bringing back such an antiquated graphics card? You know the answer. It's the endless gaping maw known as AI. Tech companies have been hoovering up PC parts for AI applications with reckless abandon. It has become a legitimate challenge for a regular person to buy RAM and graphics cards, which has led to price increases across the board and companies like Crucial closing up shop.\n\n01.05update\nrtx3060 Q1 come back… 🥲\n\n— hongxing2020 (@hongxing2020) January 5, 2026\n\nIt's particularly difficult to get ahold of GDDR7 RAM, which is needed for the newer RTX 5060 cards. So NVIDIA's solution looks to be a hop in the time machine to 2021. Gamers will need something, after all, and the 3060 technically gets the job done. Any downgrade in graphics and performance will be worth it once you watch an AI-generated video of Kurt Cobain singing in heaven with Albert Einstein, am I right? It's hilarious because they never got to meet in real life.\n\nThe RTX 3060 is still pretty popular, despite NVIDIA phasing out the card back in 2024. We don't know how much the company plans on charging for this trip down memory lane. The GPU originally cost around $329.\n\nOne would think that five-year-old technology could easily hit a much lower price point, but NVIDIA has us in a chokehold here and it can pretty much charge whatever it wants. Again, no price is too high when considering the magical wonders of generative AI. You can watch Tupac hang out with Mr. Rogers for five seconds.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nWhen Joan Van Kuren of Modesto got a notice from her insurance company stating they would not renew her home insurance policy, she was shocked to learn why. California insurance provider CSAA — part AAA’s insurance company — stated they discovered a “substantial increase in hazards” piling around her home. But they allegedly used aerial images from a drone to find it.\n\n“She said they [CSAA] flew a drone over the home,” Van Kuren told CBS Sacramento in 2024 of her call with a customer service representative. “It almost feels like someone’s looking in your windows, you know, when they tell you that they flew a drone over your home and looked at it.

If your home insurance company says they want to cut your insurance over concerns, here’s what you need to know.\n\nIn an increasing number of cases, insurance companies are using eyes in the skies to not only determine the condition of insured homes, but to assess damages once a natural disaster comes through.\n\nSince then, drones are becoming increasingly popular for insurance applications. Information technology consultant Cognizant says drones can improve efficiency and create additional accuracy, lead to closing claims faster, and improve safety for their employees.\n\nUsing a drone for an insurance inspection is not illegal in the State of California.

    "title": "Mortgage and refinance interest rates today, January 5, 2026: Rates barely above 6% but look for even lower offers",
    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance rates. Rates have barely moved since the end of October. To get a low rate, you'll want to shop multiple lenders for your best offer.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates are barely above 6%, but some lenders are already offering home loans in the mid-5% range. According to Zillow data, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.01%, and the 15-year fixed rate is 5.44%.\n\nA 5.5% rate: See which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nMORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.01%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.01% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,800, and you’d pay $348,209 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.44% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.44% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,442. But you’d only pay $139,508 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 6.01%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.44%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.23%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 6.01%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S. And of course, your credit score.\n\nNot much. According to its December forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.4% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate above 6% through next year, yet dipping down to 5.9% in Q4 2026.\n\nThe best mortgage refinance companies charge low interest rates and fees, and they often have unique perks for customers. Find your best mortgage refinance lender.\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction. Choose the best mortgage lender for your needs.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nYou can usually refinance your mortgage with the same bank or lender, but you don’t have to. Learn the pros and cons of using the same lender.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount.

    "fullText": "HP has pulled out all of the stops for CES 2026, and one of the standout AI solutions is the HP EliteBook X G2 Series, introduced at the show.\n\nCES 2026 delivered a heavy dose of AI-powered computing, and HP led the charge.

    "description": "Jonathan Carley admitted wearing His Majesty's Forces uniform without permission at Remembrance Sunday event.",
    "fullText": "For former history teacher Jonathan Carley, it must have felt like the walls closed in on him in an instant when police, searching for a fake Royal Navy officer, came knocking on the door of his grand clifftop home.\n\nInside, officers uncovered a pristine military uniform, medals and a ceremonial sword - a weapon that had first sparked suspicions.\n\nPolice were following reports that Carley, who had attended a Remembrance Sunday ceremony in north Wales dressed as a rear admiral, was actually an imposter.\n\nOn Monday, he was fined £500 after admitting to wearing a uniform or dress bearing the mark of His Majesty's Forces without permission.\n\nThe 65-year-old had joined those laying wreaths and saluted the war memorial at the ceremony in Llandudno last November.\n\nServing and former service personnel had become suspicious of the supposed rear admiral - the third highest rank in the Royal Navy - when they saw his sword and the rare Distinguished Service Order medal.\n\n\"It's one down from the Victoria Cross,\" Rear Admiral Dr Chris Parry told the BBC.\n\nHe said the DSO medal was an \"easy spot\" because it is such an exceptional award, and said only a small percentage of those who join the navy reach rear admiral.\n\n\"You're eight ranks up and two down from the head of the navy,\" said Parry, who left the Royal Navy in 2008.\n\nCarley had been attending events wearing the epaulettes and sleeve lace of a rear admiral for years, but some had been waiting to catch him.\n\nUnknown to Carley, the former private school teacher's dishonesty started to unravel at a drizzly Remembrance Day parade in Llandudno in 2024 – a year before he would be outed in national news.\n\n\"He had a massive sword on him and that is what really stuck out because we'd never seen it before,\" explained photographer Tony Mottram, who was taking pictures at the seaside resort's annual event in 2024 when he first spotted Carley.\n\nHe said Carley's medals, sword and the fact he was on his own made people wary.\n\n\"He kept in the background, but was suspicious because of that,\" said the 63-year-old who was in the Territorial Army and worked for the Royal Air Force.\n\n\"All the rest of us know each other by name. He just kept out of the picture. He was a bit of a loner, no one was talking to him.\"\n\nMottram did his best to get photographic evidence of the mystery rear admiral in 2024 - but before they knew it, he was gone.\n\nThere was outrage among some ex-service personnel and an agreement that if the bogus rear admiral was to try that again, they would be ready.\n\nSo when Carley, from Harlech in Gwynedd, resurfaced at the 2025 Remembrance Sunday service, albeit without his sword, Mr Mottram was making no mistakes.\n\n\"I looked at him more this year... and picked up on the collar, the cut and length of the tunic,\" he said.\n\n\"The hemming wasn't right, the length wasn't right. You either go on parade right or you don't go at all.\"\n\nCarley wore an array of medals on his chest which he had bought online, including the DSO - awarded for highly successful command and leadership during active operations - an honour very few personnel have been awarded since 1979.\n\nChief Petty Officer Terry Stewart had been forewarned about what happened in 2024 and after 27 years in the Royal Navy, he was suspicious about the rear admiral that was attending the 2025 parade alongside him.\n\n\"I asked the veterans in the vicinity if that was the same rear admiral as last year. They said yes,\" said CPO Stewart, who removed himself from the parade so he could follow the admiral.\n\n\"I approached him, saluted and introduced myself,\" added Stewart.\n\n\"I informed him that the ex-Royal Navy Veterans were not aware of him and I asked for his name. He said 'he must go' and that he was invited by the Lord Lieutenant's office.\"\n\nHe said Carley returned the salute, gave his full name and appeared confident and \"not at all\" worried.\n\nStewart was convinced he was talking to a fake.\n\nCarley was charged by police under a law from the 1800s that prohibits wearing a military uniform without permission - and on Monday he became the eighth person in 10 years to be taken to court charged with that offence in the UK.\n\nNo similar law exists for the medals he wore – or for those individuals that make up stories without dressing up.\n\nBBC News asked Carley about his motivation - but he didn't comment.\n\nIn his police interview, he said he wanted a sense of \"belonging and affirmation\".\n\nPictures and videos posted online show that Llandudno is not the first place Carley had dressed as a rear admiral.\n\nHe has been pictured at other Remembrance services in north Wales since 2018, shortly after it is believed he moved to the area.\n\nIn one video, he appears to be giving a speech to the public in his full admiral's uniform, complete with sword, at a Rorke's Drift memorial event.\n\nIronically, he was paying tribute to the military reenactors present.\n\nAndy Gittens first met Carley a few months before his Rorke's Drift speech, after he started attending rehearsals for his male voice choir.\n\n\"I think he'd said he was Navy. I can't remember him saying a rank,\" recalled Gittens, who said Carley didn't sing with them for long.\n\n\"As I recall he was very rarely there,\" said the former fireman from Gwynedd.\n\nBut when Gittens' choir attended Harlech Castle in 2019 for a Rorke's Drift memorial, they instantly recognised Carley.\n\n\"We gathered in the morning for rehearsal with the band and the choir. He was nowhere to be seen.\n\n\"All of a sudden he appears in this uniform. Normally those events are covered by the Lord Lieutenant, but he came bounding out larger than life.\n\n\"He was completely believable, dressed to the nines with his sword. He then proceeds to take over.\"\n\nGittens said despite his initial surprise at seeing Carley in this new role, he had no reason to doubt him until he saw the recent news coverage.\n\n\"He was quite amenable, very nice and a believable bloke,\" he said.\n\nIn the past, Carley has given newspaper interviews about both studying and rowing at Oxford and Harvard – as well as teaching at some of the country's most prestigious schools such as Eton, Cheltenham and Shiplake College.\n\nCheltenham College confirmed Carley did teach history and politics there between 1988 and 1992.\n\nThis period also appears to have been his only genuine brush with the military, with his name appearing in the London Gazette in 1991 as part of the college's Combined Cadet Force.\n\nAfter teaching, Carley is understood to have worked at Christ Church College, University of Oxford, as a rowing coach for several years.\n\nOne former student told us he was \"absolutely flabbergasted\" to see his former coach in the news while others spoke of a respected and \"warm, witty, fun\" coach.\n\n\"His role was head coach of at least a couple of the men's boats and was the coordinator of all things Christ Church rowing,\" said one former student.\n\n\"He was very good at motivating the crew. The speeches he gave were like they were previously scripted. I think other rowers really respected him. People worked really hard for him.\"\n\nCarley's former student said he \"would never have believed\" he would do something like that.\n\nEton College and the University of Oxford have not responded to requests for comment.\n\nMan admits dressing as fake navy admiral at Remembrance event\n\nIs the Australian Dream move still alive?\n\nSnow and ice warnings shut dozens of schools",

    "fullText": "Many businesses rely on nostalgia to forge deep emotional connections between their products and customers, supporting long-term brand loyalty.\n\nToday, this strategy is particularly valuable as customers grow more cautious of their spending amid rising costs and economic uncertainty.\n\nWith more than 44,000 locations across over 100 countries, McDonald's is one of the most recognizable fast-food brands in the world. While the company has continually evolved to stay competitive, it has also preserved its decades-old, globally identifiable image.\n\nThe company has strategically leveraged customers' nostalgic connections to its brand, which has helped it foster loyalty and solidify its status as a fast-food giant.\n\nOne of McDonald's most impactful nostalgic strategies has been its long-running collaboration with Pokémon. The partnership began in 1999 with the release of \"Pokémon: The First Movie,\" marking the start of a relationship that capitalized on nostalgia while producing generations of highly sought-after collectibles.\n\nIntroduced in 1996, Pokémon is a popular Japanese media franchise that has amassed a huge global following through the creation of video games, animated series, films, merchandise, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG).\n\nIn January 2025, McDonald's (MCD) launched a limited-time Pokémon Happy Meal collaboration featuring Dragon-type Pokémon designs with characters such as Charizard, Pikachu & Dragonite together, Rayquaza, and Roaring Moon.\n\nEach meal included a Pokémon TCG pack containing four of the 15 available cards, along with a Pokémon poster and a sticker sheet.\n\nTo enhance the experience, McDonald's introduced a free Pokémon TCG in-app game with a one-time redeemable code and created immersive PokéStops at select restaurant locations.\n\nNow, McDonald's is expected to partner with Pokémon once again.\n\nMcDonald's will reportedly partner with Pokémon to celebrate the franchise's 30th anniversary with a new limited-time McDonald's x Pokémon TCG Happy Meal, expected to debut in February and March 2026.\n\nAlthough the partnership is not yet officially confirmed by either McDonald's or Pokémon, Hypebeast indicates that the promotion will include four-card booster packs and feature themed packaging similar to previous releases.\n\nGiven the significance of the anniversary, fans speculate that the collaboration could come with a special surprise, much like the 25th anniversary collaboration in 2021, which released 50 collectible cards.\n\nMcDonald's maintained a long-standing relationship with Pokémon across both U.S. and international markets. The popularity of its collaboration has led to the recurring release of Pokémon-themed Happy Meals, featuring custom packaging, collectible TCG cards, and, in some cases, toys.\n\nThis partnership is particularly unique for the fast-food chain, as Pokémon Trading Cards are among the most valuable and sought-after collectibles in the world, with some cards worth up to millions of dollars.\n\n2011: Pokémon Black and White Happy Meal released in the U.S. for the first time from June to July 2011 \n\n2012: Pokémon Happy Meal from June to July 2012 \n\n2014: Pokémon X&Y Happy Meal from May to June 2014 \n\n2015: Pokémon Happy Meal with collectible toys and cards from November to December 2015 \n\n2017: Pokémon Sun & Moon Happy Meal from November to December 2017 \n\n2018: Pokémon special holographic TCG cards from October to November 2018 \n\n2019: Pokémon TCG cards and disc launcher from October to November 2019 \n\n2021: Pokémon 25th Anniversary Happy Meal \n\n2025: Dragon-type Pokémon Happy Meal \n\nLike other fast-food chains, McDonald's has faced mounting pressures in recent years, including slower customer traffic, sales declines, rising food costs, and weaker spending from cost-conscious consumers.\n\nPrices for food at home increased 2.6%, while prices for food away from home rose 3.7% in the 12 months ended September 2025, according to recent U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nAs a result, foodservice traffic declined 1% in the quarter ending June 2025, as consumers dined out less frequently, according to Circana.\n\nMore Food Insustry Businesss Startegy:\n\nChick-fil-A made a major change to its chicken, fans are noticing\n\nTaco Bell, Jack in the Box bring back discontinued menu items\n\nMcDonald’s and Burger King holiday promotions spark major backlash\n\nTo counter these trends, McDonald’s has expanded value offerings, including the McValue menu, Extra Value Meals, and $5 Meal Deals.\n\n\"In response to the decreasing food dollar and the empowered customer, restaurants are turning to innovative business and operating models to grab a greater share of the market,\" said KPMG Restaurant Segment Leader Paul Fultz and Strategy Leader of Consumer Markets Joel Rampoldt in a study.\n\nIn March, the company also launched the Restaurant Experience Team, bringing together operations, supply chain, franchising, development, restaurant design, delivery, and Speedee Labs to drive innovation and efficiency.\n\n\"Value is rarely defined only by price,\" said Circana Senior VP and Industry Advisor for Food and Foodservice David Portalatin in a statement. \"Operational excellence in providing quality, affordability, great experiences, and convenience is what leads winning restaurants and their supply chain partners to greater success.\"\n\nMcDonald's demonstrates how nostalgia can be more than a marketing tactic; it's a driver of brand loyalty, repeated engagement, and cultural relevance.\n\nExtended its digital presence to over 185 million 90-day active users across 60 markets.\n\nLoyalty customers generated about $30 billion in systemwide sales in 2024.\n\nGlobal comparable sales increased 3.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, with U.S. comparable sales up 2.4%.\n\nDespite improvement, the company remains cautious.\n\n\"We continue to remain cautious about the health of the consumer in the U.S. and our top international markets and believe the pressures will continue well into 2026,\" said McDonald’s CEO Christopher J. Kempczinski in an earnings call.\n\n\"It's a foundational expectation of our brand to bring consumers through our doors and keep them coming back.\"",

    "description": "Both allies and adversaries of the United States on Monday used an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to voice opposition to the audacious U.S. military operation in Venezuela that captured leader Nicolás Maduro.",
    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Both allies and adversaries of the United States on Monday used an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to voice opposition to the audacious U.S. military operation in Venezuela that captured leader Nicolás Maduro.\n\nBefore the U.N.'s most powerful body, countries critiqued — if sometimes obliquely — President Donald Trump's intervention in the South American country and his recent comments signaling the possibility of expanding military action to countries like Colombia and Mexico over drug trafficking accusations. The Republican president also has reupped his threat to take over the Danish territory of Greenland for the sake of U.S. security interests.\n\nDenmark, which has jurisdiction over the mineral-rich island, carefully denounced U.S. prospects for taking over Greenland without mentioning its NATO ally by name.\n\n“The inviolability of borders is not up for negotiation,” said Christina Markus Lassen, Danish ambassador to the U.N.\n\nShe also defended Venezuela's sovereignty, saying “no state should seek to influence political outcomes in Venezuela through the use of threat of force or through other means inconsistent with international law.”\n\nUS allies push back on Venezuela\n\nWhile French President Emmanuel Macron recently endorsed Maduro's capture, its U.N. envoy was slightly more critical Monday, saying any violations of international law by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, which include the U.S., erodes “the very foundation of the international order.”\n\n“The military operation that has led to the capture of Maduro runs counter to the principle of peace dispute resolution and runs counter to the principle of non-use of force,\" said Jay Dharmadhikari, deputy French ambassador to the U.N.\n\nU.S. envoy Mike Waltz defended the operation in Venezuela as a justified and “surgical law enforcement operation,” calling out the 15-member council for criticizing the targeting of Maduro.\n\n“If the United Nations in this body confers legitimacy on an illegitimate narco-terrorist with the same treatment in this charter of a democratically elected president or head of state, what kind of organization is this?” said Waltz, who is Trump’s former national security adviser.\n\nMaduro's 2024 reelection was widely disputed.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement that he is “deeply concerned that rules of international law have not been respected with regard to the 3 January military action.” He said the “grave” action by the U.S. could set a precedent for how future relations between nations unfold.\n\nVenezuela calls on the UN to take action\n\nEven with the strong support for Venezuela's sovereignty, its envoy called on the U.N. to go beyond veiled comments and condemnation. Ambassador Samuel Moncada urged the Security Council to demand that Washington release Maduro and his wife.\n\n“If the kidnapping of a head of state, the bombing of a sovereign country and the open threat of further armed action are tolerated or downplayed, the message sent to the world is a devastating one: namely that the law is optional, and that force is the true arbiter of international relations,” Moncada said.\n\nHe warned that other countries can’t afford to look away: “Accepting such a logic would mean to open the door to a deeply unstable world.”\n\nNeighboring Colombia described the raid as reminiscent of “the worst interference in our area in the past.”\n\n“Democracy cannot be defended or promoted through violence and coercion, and it cannot be superseded, either, by economic interests,” Ambassador Leonor Zalabata said.\n\nChina and Russia are expectedly critical\n\nThe biggest critics of U.S. foreign policy, China and Russia, which are also permanent members of the Security Council, called for the U.N. body to unite in rejecting America turning back to an “era of lawlessness.”\n\nMaduro, like his predecessor, forged a close relationship with Russia, while China was the main destination for most Venezuelan oil.\n\n“We cannot allow the United States to proclaim itself as some kind of a supreme judge, which alone bears the right to invade any country, to label culprits, to hand down and to enforce punishments irrespective of notions of international law, sovereignty and nonintervention,” Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said.\n\nHis own country’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine has drawn widespread condemnation within the U.N. and from the U.S., although the Trump administration is engaging with Russia in hopes of brokering an end to the fighting.\n\nThe U.S. seized Maduro and his wife early Saturday from their home on a military base and put them aboard a U.S. warship to face prosecution in New York in a Justice Department indictment accusing them of participating in a narco-terrorism conspiracy. Maduro declared his innocence during his first appearance in a Manhattan courthouse Monday.\n\nHis stunning removal came after months of the U.S. amassing a military presence off Venezuela’s coast and blowing up alleged drug trafficking boats. Trump has insisted that the U.S. would run Venezuela at least temporarily and tap its vast oil reserves to sell to other nations.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, however, says the U.S. would enforce an oil quarantine that was already in place on sanctioned tankers and use that leverage to press policy changes in Venezuela.\n\nThis article has been changed to correct the spelling of Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia's name.",

Experts have said that the move could reshape the global energy market, disadvantaging China and Russia.\n\n\"They were pumping almost nothing by comparison to what they could have been,\" Trump said in a public address.\n\nTrump's comments followed an early Saturday raid in which US armed forces and law enforcement struck parts of the capital, Caracas, and captured Maduro and his wife.\n\nIn Monday's NBC interview, Trump said, \"Having a Venezuela that's an oil producer is good for the United States because it keeps the price of oil down.\"\n\nLower oil prices could mean cheaper gas for average Americans, but may also disincentivize the \"very large United States oil companies\" that Trump said he may subsidize.\n\nTrump added it was \"too soon\" to say whether he had spoken to executives at Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips, America's three largest oil producers.\n\nThe oil market has been under pressure, with crude prices falling 20% last year. A main issue facing the market is an oversupply of global crude because of sluggish demand. It's a focus of OPEC+, which over the weekend said it will refrain from pumping new oil during the first quarter.",

    "fullText": "New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani hit the ground running, signing two executive orders in his first week that combat hidden junk fees.\n\nMamdani signed orders targeting business practices that \"drain money from New Yorkers and make essential goods and services less affordable,\" per a release from his office on Monday.\n\nIn a speech announcing the orders against junk fees on Monday, Mamdani said, \"We reckon with it when we try to buy concert tickets, when we book a flight, when we settle our credit card bill, or even when we pay rent. A $5 fee here, a $10 fee there — what seems small adds up quickly.\"\n\nHis first order targeted fees that \"do not meaningfully contribute to the service\" and are hidden until after the purchase has been made, the release said.\n\nThe second order took aim at what Mamdani called \"subscription traps and tricks,\" including free trials that automatically convert into paid plans, and subscriptions disguised as one-time purchases. The order also talked about subscriptions that make cancellations \"intentionally difficult.\"\n\nDuring his speech, Mamdani was accompanied by Sam Levine, his newly appointed commissioner of New York City's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection. Levine previously served as a director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection.\n\nTo combat junk fees, Mamdani announced that he would establish a citywide junk fee task force to crack down on offending businesses.\n\nIn 2023, the Biden administration also took aim at junk fees. In his State of the Union address in February 2023, former President Joe Biden criticized hidden hotel fees and surcharges on purchases, such as plane tickets.\n\nIn May 2025, the FTC announced a new rule on unfair or deceptive fees, which prohibits \"bait-and-switch\" pricing and misrepresentation of fees for live-event tickets and short-term lodging.\n\nMamdani was sworn in as New York's first Muslim mayor on January 1. The 34-year-old, one of the youngest to hold the top job, centered his mayoral campaign on fixing New York City's affordability crisis.",

    "description": "Here are the highlights from the world's largest technology trade show happening in Las Vegas, including a new Nvidia chip architecture.",
    "fullText": "The tech scene is starting the year off strong.\n\nOn January 6, the Consumer Electronics Show, the largest and most influential technology trade show, is set to kick off in Las Vegas.\n\nA CES keynote presentation of a new chip from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang already got the show started.\n\nBased on early announcements, the audience can expect novelties this year like the Sweekar AI pet that physically grows, robots that can bend backwards, and a wallpaper TV that is only 0.35 inches thick. Business Insider's Lloyd Lee is also on the scene to report on the latest autonomous vehicle technologies.\n\nFollow this post over the rest of the week to keep up with the most groundbreaking tech at the 2026 CES.\n\nOn Monday, ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show, Huang officially introduced the Vera Rubin architecture, which is now in production and expected to ramp up in volume in the second half of the year. This move follows a blockbuster year for its Blackwell chip, as demand for AI infrastructure continued to surge.\n\nIn a press briefing ahead of Huang's keynote, Dion Harris, Nvidia's senior director of HPC and AI infrastructure solutions, described Vera Rubin as \"six chips that make one AI supercomputer.\"\n\n\"Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing,\" Huang told the audience during a presentation at the CES.\n\nHuang added that compared to the Blackwell model, Rubin marks a leap in performance, with more than triple the speed, could run inference five times faster, and can deliver significantly more inference compute per watt of energy.\n\nRubin was first announced in 2024 and has been slated to replace Blackwell ever since. The early debut comes months ahead of the late-2026 timeline Nvidia had previously projected.\n\nNamed after astronomer Vera Rubin, who discovered the existence of dark matter, Nvidia said in a press release that the architecture is designed to support more complex, agent-style AI workloads, as well as more networking and data movement.\n\nThe Rubin systems are already lined up for deployment across much of the cloud industry. Nvidia said partners, including Amazon Web Services, OpenAI, Anthropic, alongside the upcoming Doudna system at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, all plan to use the new platform.\n\nThe accelerated launch comes shortly after Nvidia reported record data center revenue, up 66% from a year earlier, driven largely by demand for Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Those chips have become a benchmark for the current AI boom are widely seen as a test of whether spending on AI infrastructure is sustainable.\n\nHuang has previously estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion could be spent globally on AI infrastructure over the next five years. Nvidia said products and services built on the Rubin platform will begin rolling out from partners in the second half of 2026.\n\nNvidia's Huang also used his presentation to unveil Alpamayo, a new open AI model and toolset designed to bring reasoning to autonomous vehicles.\n\nHuang said that Mercedes-Benz cars powered by the system are already expected to hit the road in the first quarter of 2026.\n\n\"Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,\" said Huang.\n\nAlpamayo is Nvidia's first full-stack push into self-driving technology, with the goal of using vision-language-action models to handle rare and unfamiliar driving scenarios.\n\nMercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius said during the presentation that he recently tested the Nvidia-powered system on public roads and drove for more than an hour through heavy traffic.\n\n\"It feels that the car is on rails. You're just driving, and it does everything,\" Källenius said. \"If you're moving an object that weighs 4,000 pounds at 50 miles an hour, sorry is not going to cut it.\"\n\nBoston Dynamics is teaming up with Google DeepMind to integrate the Gemini AI into its humanoid robot, Atlas, and its robot dog called Spot. Unveiled with Boston Dynamics's parent company, Hyundai Motor Group, at CES on Monday, the partnership aims to let Atlas understand natural-language commands, adapt on the fly, and interact more naturally with people, with the goal of pushing the machine from lab demos into real-world work.\n\nExecutives of Boston Dynamics said in a press release that by embedding a foundation model, Atlas could move beyond preprogrammed actions to navigating unfamiliar environments and identifying and manipulating objects, all of which are core skills for manual labor.\n\n\"Atlas is going to revolutionize the way industry works,\" said CEO Robert Playter in the press release, \"And it marks the first step toward a long-term goal we have dreamed about since we were children—useful robots that can walk into our homes and help make our lives safer, more productive, and more fulfilling.\"",

    "description": "The \"Huberman Lab\" podcast host says good health comes down to \"intentionally high cortisol in the morning and intentionally low cortisol at night.\"",
    "fullText": "Stanford neuroscientist Andrew Huberman says one morning habit plays a key role in his overall health.\n\nIn an interview with GQ published on Monday, the host of the popular \"Huberman Lab\" podcast shared the routines he's relying on to stay healthy in 2026.\n\n\"Getting your physical health right — which puts your mental health in the best possible place — is all about intentionally high cortisol in the morning and intentionally low cortisol at night,\" Huberman told GQ.\n\nAlthough cortisol has a bad reputation as a stress hormone, Huberman says it plays an important role in how the body transitions from sleep to wakefulness.\n\n\"No, you wake up in the morning because of a rise in cortisol. You want a big, massive spike of cortisol in the morning. If you don't spike your morning cortisol, your cortisol spikes in the afternoon or evening, and then everything goes awry, OK? You want your morning cortisol at least 30x higher than your nighttime cortisol,\" he said.\n\nOne way to keep that rhythm on track would be to send the body a signal.\n\n\"The best way to spike your morning cortisol is to get bright light — ideally from sunlight — in your eyes in the first hour after waking. If you can't do that, maybe invest in a 10,000 Lux artificial light,\" Huberman said.\n\nIf that's not possible, he suggests flipping on \"as many artificial lights as you can.\"\n\n\"I've made a mistake in the past — a tactical mistake, a strategic mistake — by calling it sunlight. People say, 'It's overcast.' What we should say is, 'Get daylight in your eyes,'\" he said.\n\nHaving dim mornings and bright nights is \"the worst way to go,\" he added.\n\nLight exposure isn't the only thing Huberman says matters in the morning. He also encourages people to fit in a workout if they can.\n\n\"If you don't have time to exercise first thing in the morning, you need bodily movement. Even some knee bends, some arm swings, some jumping jacks. Movement generates cortisol and adrenaline,\" he said.\n\nWhen it comes to winding down at night, people should take the opposite approach, Huberman said.\n\n\"If you want to wear BluBlockers, you can. But dim the lights down, avoid caffeine. If you're going to exercise, don't make it terribly intense,\" he said.\n\nThe benefits of getting light in the mornings are supported by broader research in the field.\n\nMariana Figueiro, professor and director of the Light and Health Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told Business Insider in 2023 that getting daylight is \"just as important as diet and exercise.\"\n\n\"Light in the built environment is not always strong enough to synchronize the biological clock,\" Figueiro said. \"The beauty of daylight is that daylight is the right amount, it's the right color, it's on at the right time.\"\n\nMoreover, getting enough darkness at night is just as crucial, since circadian disruption has been linked to poor cognitive performance and a weakened immune system, Figueiro said.",

    "title": "CES 2026: This Water Dispenser Uses Facial Recognition to Track Your Cats' Drinking Habits",
    "description": "If you have more than one cat, it can track them all.",
    "fullText": "I spent some time with Petkit on the show floor of CES on Monday, where I got to see the company's automatic wet food cat feeder, its newest smart litter box, as well as an AI-powered water dispenser. Of course, a water dispenser should ideally do one thing: dispense fresh water for your pet. The Eversweet Ultra water dispenser, however, adds a number of smart features to the mix, some of which actually seem particular useful for owners of multiple cats.\n\nI first learned about this water dispenser last week when Petkit officially announced it, and some of the specs and features are the same on paper as they are in person: This smart dispenser comes with a five-liter tank, as well as a 1080p camera with a 140-degree-wide-angle view. That allows you to see your cat approach the dispenser, as well as monitor their drinking habits. You can either choose to tap into a live stream to watch them as they drink, or check out prerecorded clips saved to the app. Petkit tells me the app even chops up clips for you to post to your socials automatically—if you think your friends and family want close-ups of your cat taking a drink.\n\nOne of Petkit's selling points here, however, is the health tracking. The clips aren't just for posting to stories; instead, the camera can track how your pet drinks over time, noting any discrepancies or changes. You can see daily, monthly, and even yearly drinking trends, so you know whether your cat is drinking an abnormal amount of water for January. I'd want to consult a veterinarian before definitively stating whether this type of tracking is effective, but I can imagine it might be useful to know whether your cat changes its behaviors—something you might not notice if you aren't diligently watching them drink.\n\nThat doesn't change if you have multiple cats, either. The Eversweet's camera uses machine learning for facial recognition, and can identify individual cats in your home. That health tracking can apply to specific cats as they drink water, so you shouldn't have results mixed between your various pets. If you really want to know when one cat is drinking water over another, this should help you keep track.\n\nWhile some water dispensers recycle the water, the Eversweet disposes of the water after a set period of time. I knew about this from the press release, but it was fun seeing the machine dump the water in real time: The pump that serves to keep the water running cuts out, and the entire mechanism lifts up to reveal a drain. The water dumps out, and a spout refills the tank, only to dump the water again. This is an attempt to clean out the tray, and remove any bits of hair or debris that might've been left behind.\n\nPetkit also made a point of showing me that the dispenser's pump is always running, which turns the Eversweet into a bit of a water feature—not that you should buy one just for decoration. The idea is, cats are a bit more attracted to the moving water than still water, which encourages them to drink. I don't have a cat, so I can't speak to that, but it's an added aesthetic perk—until the water dumps out, of course.\n\nPetkit says it's aiming for an April release for the Eversweet, which will be available on both Amazon as well as through Petkit's official site.",

    "title": "CES 2026: AMD Just Showed Off 'Helios,' the Hardware That Will Power the AI Content in Your Feeds",
    "description": "\"The world's best AI rack.\"",
    "fullText": "When you come across an AI video on Instagram, or watch ChatGPT respond to your query, do you ever think about how that content was generated? Beyond the actual programs and prompts, generative AI takes an enormous amount of compute to support, especially as it skyrockets in popularity. As such, AI companies are looking for more power than ever, which means, of course, turning to those that make the hardware.\n\nDuring a Monday evening keynote, AMD's CEO Dr. Lisa Su showed off the hardware that will soon power everything from ChatGPT to the AI videos overwhelming your feeds. Su introduced \"Helios\" against a backdrop of dramatic music, the company's upcoming AI rack, that packs a staggering amount of computing power into a rack that weighs nearly 7,000 pounds.\n\nEach \"cross-section\" of these racks, if you will, is powered by four key AMD pieces of hardware: The company's new AMD Instinct MI455X GPU, the new AMD EPYC \"Veince\" CPU, the AMD Pensando \"Vulcano\" 800 AI NIC, and the AMD Pensando \"Salina\" 400 DPU. There are some staggering stats here: Helios is capable of 2.9 exaflops of AI compute, and comes with 31 TB of HBM4 memory. It offers 43 TB per second scale out Bandwidth, and is developed with 2nm and 3nm architecture. The rack has 4,600 \"Zen 6\" CPU cores, and 18,000 GPU compute units. In other words, this isn't your average piece of hardware.\n\nSu's pitch is that the AI industry is in need of this additional compute power. She notes how the world used one ZettaFlop of computing power in 2022 on AI technology, compared to 100 ZettaFlops in 2025. (For the curious, one ZettaFlop has a value of 10 to the power of 21.) It's no surprise: AI is everywhere, and many of us are using it—whether we know it or not. Some of us are using it overtly, generating AI videos or running chatbots daily. But others are using AI quietly embedded in functions, like live translation.\n\nSu welcomed reps from OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, and Luma AI, which creates generative AI video content, to talk about how additional compute helps their programs. But during Luma AI's demonstration of its hyperrealistic video generations, all I could think about was how this type of content is already tricking people into thinking its real, when it's entirely fabricated—not to mention the impact on human artists. AMD is optimistic about AI, and the data centers powering it, but critics have been pushing back, citing concerns with the impacts on the communities companies are building these data centers in.\n\nHelios will likely be a major success for AMD, but it comes at an interesting time for tech, and AI in general. AI is more popular than ever, but it's also more controversial than ever. I see hardware like Helios only fueling the fire in both directions.\n\nIn addition to Helios, Su announced the AMD Ryzen AI 400 series. These newest chips comes with either 12 \"Zen 5\" CPU cores and 24 threads, 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores, a 60 TOPS XDNA 2 NPU, and memory speeds of 8,533 MT/s. AMD says the Ryzen AI 400 series is 1.7 times faster at content creation and 1.3 times faster at multitasking whe compared to Intel Core Ultra 9 288V.\n\nThese new chips will ship soon in a number of major PC brands, including Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Beelink, Colorful, Gigabyte, LG, Mechrevo, MSI, and NEC.",

    "fullText": "If you're anything like me, you spend 90% of your time using your laptop with it docked and plugged into a monitor (or two). And if you're at that point, you might be wondering why you even bother having a screen attached to your computer at all. If so, HP's got your back. Announced at this year's CES, the HP Eliteboard G1a looks like a normal keyboard on the outside, but on the inside, it's got a whole Windows PC.\n\nThat's not exactly a new concept, but with the experimental days of Windows XP long behind us, it's mostly been reserved for less powerful, Linux-based single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi. That's great if you're a hacker or tinkerer, but not if you're just looking for a screenless, keyboard-equipped Mini PC to get you through the workday.\n\nThe Eliteboard G1a, instead, comes equipped with the latest AMD Ryzen AI chips, up to 64GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage, so while you shouldn't expect to play the latest and greatest games on it, for internet browsers and lightweight productivity programs, it should really be able to hustle.\n\nIt's also a bit of a sleeper build. I've been able to go hands-on with it, and to all outside eyes, it really does look like a regular office keyboard, complete with black, low-profile chiclet keys, a function row, and a numpad. Ranging from 1.5 to 1.7 pounds based on how you spec it out, it's also pretty lightweight, and the right person might believe you if you said it was just a keyboard, with no computer inside whatsoever.\n\nThe catch? This baby is aimed at enterprise customers, rather than your typical consumer. That does come with a few bonuses, like a Kensington lock slot, some extra security software, and an optional fingerprint reader. But it also means you're not going to find it up for sale anywhere other than the HP store, and while pricing hasn't been announced yet, it'll probably be a bit more expensive if bought individually rather than as part of an office fleet. It can also only connect to monitors using DisplayPort, which is fine if you're an office manager that knows to buy displays that will work with it, but may not fit into everyone's home set-up.\n\nThat's a shame, because I love unusual form factors, and this keyboard PC could make for a really clean desk in my home office. It's strong enough, uses a familiar operating system with wide app compatibility, and can even output to two 4K monitors at once. There are also two versions, one that always needs to be plugged in, and one with a battery and a detachable USB power cable for quickly moving between different workstations. That's great flexibility, since the battery version is a bit more portable, but is also heavier.\n\nHere's hoping this is just an early experiment for HP, because I'd love to buy a consumer version of this laptop at some point in the future. If you're willing to take the plunge on the enterprise model, though, HP says it's expected to launch on HP.com sometime in March.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Intel's New Chips Are Coming For Your Gaming Handhelds",
    "description": "Intel's got a new integrated GPU, and is promising better battery life.",
    "fullText": "Every year at CES, Intel and AMD announce their newest processors. This year, Intel debuted its first line of chips made with its 18a process, which stands for 18 angstroms, or under 2nm. To make that a little less nerdy, that means these chips can fit a lot of tech into a small area, which means big gains in performance.\n\nColloquially called Panther Lake, the new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips are focused on laptops and mini-PCs. But that doesn't mean they don't put out impressive numbers. During its keynote, Intel promised \"77% faster gaming performance,\" and for everyone actually using their PCs to do work, \"60% better multithread performance.\" Impressively, it also said its new chips would also enable \"up to 27 hours of battery life,\" rivaling Apple's M-series chips and other ARM chips from manufacturers like Qualcomm. Battery life has been a sore spot for both Intel and AMD for a while, and I'm excited to get my hands on machines that use Panther Lake processors.\n\nAnd then there's the AI. Intel says its top Intel Core Ultra Series 3 models have 50 NPU TOPs and 180 TOPS in total when you combine the NPU and GPU numbers. To translate, that basically means faster AI performance for developers who don't want to bother with the cloud, and would prefer the speed and privacy of a locally downloaded AI model.\n\nSpeaking of that GPU, Intel's upgraded its integrated graphics this generation to the Intel Arc B390, which has twice the cache of its prior GPU and 50% more cores. I already mentioned that 77% increase in gaming performance, but AI developers will also see a 53% increase in performance over Intel Core Ultra Series 2, and a two times performance increase over Intel Core Ultra Series 1.\n\nSo, better computers. That's pretty par for the course for CES, but there is a \"one more thing\" here. Intel is coming for AMD's dominance in handheld gaming PCs.\n\nUntil now, most handheld gaming PCs have used AMD chips, with those that have opted for Intel getting hit in reviews for buggy or poorly optimized performance. The Steam Deck uses an AMD chip, and so does the Xbox handheld. Intel says it's going to change that.\n\nAfter announcing the new integrated GPU and walking through features like frame generation and ray tracing, the company said it \"will be launching an entire handheld gaming platform with Panther Lake.\"\n\nThat means big moves, and soon—Panther Lake won't last long before getting replaced. The company didn't say much more, but it did show a slide with partners set to use Intel chips in their handhelds, including Acer, MSI, and hey, Microsoft. I guess we'll see another Xbox handheld model soon.\n\nAnd that's about it for Intel this year. The new chips are smaller, stronger, and more efficient, but smartly, the company is also planning to use them to shore up its weaknesses, specifically in gaming and battery life. That makes sense. With developers like Apple having famously ditched Intel throughout the decade, the company has been on the backfoot.\n\nAccording to Intel, the earliest machines powered by Intel Core Ultra Series 3 will start accepting pre-orders on January 6, with availability beginning on January 27.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Sony's Keynote This Year Was All About Electric Cars",
    "description": "The Sony Honda Mobility Afeela 1 is finally coming out.",
    "fullText": "At last year's CES, Sony's press conference showed off products from all over its portfolio, including a first look at The Last of Us season 2. This year, it was all about the Afeela, an electric car Sony's making in collaboration with Honda that it's been teasing for years, but is now finally getting ready to release.\n\nSony has big plans for Afeela. Previews have been less about hard specs like mileage or speed and more about the company's plans to change how we look at cars. Previously, that's included demo'ing integrations with other Sony services like Crunchyroll and themes for the car's interior based on Sony brands. Just last month, the company confirmed it would support PlayStation Remote Play in the Afeela, after teasing it at CES 2024. And the first time I saw the Afeela at CES, it was driven onto stage using a PS5 controller.\n\nNow, Sony's ready to talk more than aesthetics and cute integrations, but that unique voice didn't go anywhere. Headlining the show was the promise that the company's currently working on something called Afeela Intelligent Drive. Currently, it's sitting at level 2+ driver assistance, which means it can handle tasks like merging or lane changes, but Sony's planning to take it to level 4+ \"in the future,\" meaning full self-driving within certain areas. It probably won't be ready for launch, but it does show the company's getting serious about usability.\n\nOn that note, it also showed concepts for a future where Afeela users will basically just chill while the car drives itself. Those kind of promises aren't rare at CES, but Sony specifically called out its brand of entertainment products as what riders would occupy themselves with on their rides. Combined with the Intelligent Drive news, apparently that's what all those ecosystem cross-promotions were leading towards.\n\nBut until that future arrives, Sony still isn't afraid to use Afeela to push its products, although it isn't stopping there. The company brought PlayStation on stage to quickly reaffirm Remote Play will be baked into the Afeela (while also dropping the surprising stat that apparently half of all PlayStation Remote Play sessions now happen on the PlayStation Portal streaming handheld). It also said that the Afeela will have themes for its touchscreens based on Sony properties like Astro Bot and Gran Turismo. None of that is too far off from what the company's shown before, but the idea of turning your car into a media ecosystem doesn't stop there. Sony also announced the Afeela co-creation program, which will let developers and content creators make their own custom apps or media for the car.\n\nThese include things like themes and even special Android apps, but apparently, drivers can even customize the Afeela's \"motor\" sound, and put visuals on a small \"media bar\" on the front of the car. As an example, Sony brought out Japanese music producer Tomoko Ida, who demonstrated a motor sound she created that sounded more like a THX commercial than anything else.\n\nIt's honestly a pretty clever move for a car that's been all about the ecosystem as opposed to the hard specs so far. But it does have one oddity that maybe speaks to how long this thing's been teased. Apparently, developers for the Co-Creation program will be able to get paid in crypto, which Sony says will \"accelerate open co-creation,\" although it also says the Co-Creation program will be \"open to other automakers and service providers.\" I'm not sure Toyota will want to get paid on the blockchain, but whatever.\n\nDrivers will be able to access utilities and apps made for their Afeela using an app, but that raises the question: When will you finally be able to drive this thing?\n\nThe Afeela has been teased since CES 2023, but finally Sony says the car is in production and will begin delivering to customers in California sometime this year. In fact, all the photos you've seen of the Afeela throughout this article have been of an actual pre-production model for the initial Afeela car, now called Afeela 1.\n\nThat's huge for Afeela, but there is a catch. Those deliveries might take a while to reach the rest of the country. Sony says Arizona is next on its radar, but that sales won't make it there until 2027. Japanese deliveries are also slated for 2027, but living in New York, I'll just have to keep pretending this thing doesn't exist.\n\nThat's a bit of a blow for a car that started off this press conference promising a new future for how we drive, since even once it gets on the streets, it'll probably take even longer for that to come true. Still, Sony says it will allow people who have already registered to buy a car to start doing test drives of the car sometime before deliveries begin.\n\nI'll be honest, I don't cover cars much, and that this year's Sony press conference was all about one maybe points to a quiet year across the rest of the brand. That said, for people who are into driving, I can see the Afeela's appeal. It definitely feels more like a gadget than a gas guzzler, and I'm wondering if this is what the Apple Car might have looked like if it ever came out.\n\nProbably not—despite the fancy mock-ups, I did sit inside an Afeela last year, and it was fancy but still familiar. But that's also not where Afeela is stopping. Sony ended its keynote by driving the \"Afeela Prototype 2026\" onto the stage. It didn't look that different from the outside, but the company says it will offer \"greater spatial flexibility and accessibility.\" To me, that implies a step closer towards that future where the car is essentially a hangout zone that moves you while you play PlayStation, but only time will tell. I'll see you when I actually get behind the wheel of one of these things, probably sometimes in 2040.",

    "title": "CES 2026: These Smart Glasses Can Help Some People See Even Better Than Normal Glasses",
    "description": "People with central vision loss can see text and faces with this device.",
    "fullText": "“Smart” glasses have been big at CES this year, but the headset that has impressed me most is a device that helps people with central vision loss, including those who are considered “legally blind,” to see what they otherwise couldn’t. At a press event, I met a woman with macular degeneration, Liz Baker, who uses them daily—and I got to try them myself.\n\nThe device is called eSight Go. It’s a headset with little screens in front of your eyes, sort of like a VR headset, but small enough to perch on your nose. The device’s battery pack sits around the back of your neck, so that you don’t have to support the weight of the battery on your head. The glasses are bulky, but the battery pack design made them comfortable for me to wear.\n\nThe device is designed for people with central vision loss, which includes conditions like macular degeneration. In these conditions, the middle of the person’s visual field isn’t clear—things they look directly at appear blurry or simply aren’t visible, but their peripheral vision is still clear.\n\nRegular eyewear can’t correct this issue, since the information in the center of the visual field just isn’t there. But the eSight device works by zooming in so much that the person’s peripheral vision is able to process what they’re seeing, and that central “blind spot” essentially disappears. The company’s studies show that people gain seven lines of improvement on vision charts—that’s huge.\n\nIt’s hard for me, as a sighted person, to know exactly what that’s like, but Baker gave me a few examples. With the device, she can read ingredient labels and see people’s facial features; without it, those things are literally a blur. She told me about noticing her daughter’s freckles when looking through the eSight device, and using it to shop without help. (Previously, small text at stores was impossible to read; she says she kept buying shampoo when she meant to buy conditioner.)\n\nThe device has a dizzying array of features that I wasn’t able to master in my short time with it. To name a few: You can zoom in and out with buttons on the arm of the headset, or with a handheld remote. You can increase the contrast of whatever you're looking at. You can freeze-frame, zoom in, and then move your head to read the enlarged image as if it were a giant billboard in front of you (even if it’s something small or far away, like a brochure in your hand or a menu on a restaurant wall.)\n\nThe device costs $4,950 and is not covered by most insurance. It comes with access to a “coach” who is themselves an eSight user with vision loss who can talk new users through learning the features or helping them to figure out how to do specific tasks.\n\nThe battery life on the eSight Go is about four hours, so I asked Baker how she keeps the device charged throughout the day. She says she doesn’t wear the glasses continuously, which saves battery life. She keeps them around her neck (essentially in a sleep mode) when she isn’t actively using them to read text or look at a specific thing in detail.\n\nDirector of sales Roland Mattern says people who test the glasses sometimes zoom all the way in and note that the image can be pixelated, but most users don’t need the max zoom level, and those who do tend to find that it’s still an improvement over what they can see without the glasses.\n\nThe hefty price isn’t usually covered by insurance, although the Department of Veterans Affairs will cover it, and Mattern says a few users with other insurance companies have sometimes managed to get coverage. Sometimes other programs can cover it, like state-run vocational rehabilitation programs that help people with disabilities return to work.",

    "title": "What A Cubs Trade Could Look Like For Edward Cabrera",
    "description": "Could the Cubs land Edward Cabrera? We analyze potential trade packages, including top prospects, to acquire the Marlins' ace pitcher.",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Cubs continue to do their due diligence on several players this offseason.\n\nOver the past week, the Cubs have been linked to Alex Bregman, Bo Bichette, and Cody Bellinger in free agency. With the North Siders needing another impactful bat in their lineup, it’s not surprising to see them interested in so many of the top remaining bats on the open market.\n\nAnother name has also popped up in connection with the Cubs. This time, it’s a pitcher in the trade market.\n\nAccording to Jon Heyman of the New York Post, Chicago is reportedly interested in trading for Miami Marlins pitcher Edward Cabrera. Although the New York Yankees appear to be in deeper talks with the Marlins for Cabrera, the Cubs being mentioned here is significant.\n\nAfter failing to sign Tatsuya Imai in free agency, it appears the Cubs are now pivoting to the trade market. The front office was interested in trading for Cabrera at the 2025 Trade Deadline, but the Marlins' asking price was a bit too high.\n\nBut those trade talks have likely picked up since the Cubs missed out on Imai. The team still needs a frontline starting pitcher, and Cabrera would be the perfect answer for Chicago. He showed last year that he can be a reliable arm in any rotation.\n\nSo, what could a deal look like between the Cubs and the Marlins involving Cabrera?\n\nWe’ll use two different sources to identify who the Cubs might have to give up in any deal involving Cabrera.\n\nOur first source comes from Eric Hubbs of Barstool Sports. He reported that the Yankees could include No. 6 prospect Ben Hess and No. 16 prospect Dillon Lewis in any deal for Cabrera. FanSided insider Robert Murray actually gave Hubbs his flowers for accurately reporting that in an episode of the Baseball Insiders Podcast.\n\nOur second source comes from Baseball Trade Values. This site does a great job of comparing players’ trade values. With Cabrera having a 27.6 value in their model, we can identify who the Cubs need to give up for the right-hander.\n\nEven though the Yankees are only said to be giving up their No. 6 and No. 16 prospect, it likely would cost the Cubs a lot more to acquire Cabrera. Both Hess and Lewis have a ton of potential, and both are rising stars in New York’s farm system.\n\nFor the Cubs, giving up No. 3 prospect Jaxon Wiggins and No. 5 prospect Kevin Alcantara could complete the deal. Both Wiggins' (21.3) and Alcantara’s (7.3) trade values in that model basically equal Cabrera’s trade value (28.6).\n\nThe Marlins would essentially get two ready-now players who have plenty of potential, and the Cubs would get a top-of-the-line starting pitcher who still has three years of control remaining. Cabrera isn’t a free agent until after the 2028 season.\n\nHowever, it all depends on whether the Cubs would actually deal Wiggins in any trade for Cabrera. The team’s top pitching prospect is set to contribute to the Major League club at some point in 2026 and projects to be a dominant rotation arm.",

    "fullText": "Daniel Cormier lauds Jake Paul for being brave, but doesn't think he's very smart.\n\nPaul was knocked out by former two-time unified heavyweight champion and Olympic gold medalist Anthony Joshua in Round 6 of their boxing match at Kaseya Center in Miami last month.\n\nThe loss resulted in Paul breaking his jaw in two places, but that hasn't stopped the 28-year-old, who immediately turned his attention to Francis Ngannou.\n\n\"Jake Paul just got his head bashed in by Anthony Joshua, right? That was about as big a learning lesson that anyone could have been taught,\" Cormier said on his YouTube channel. \"Here's the problem: Jake Paul has proven to be, one, hard-headed; two, more bold and brave than anyone could have ever imagined – bold and brave because he fought Anthony Joshua to begin with.\n\n\"Bold and brave because they didn't put any things in place to make sure Anthony didn't do exactly what he did to him, broke his jaw in multiple places, got him sucking out of a straw. It would seem like his bold and brave attitude really cost him. And with that bold and brave attitude a lot of the times comes cowardice after. Not Jake Paul. Not Jake Paul. You can love him, you can hate him, but he's brave.\"\n\nCormier is shocked to see Paul go after Ngannou, who almost beat Tyson Fury, but also got knocked out by Joshua.\n\n\"I would have thought, I swear to God, I would have thought that after what happened with Anthony Joshua, Jake Paul would say, 'OK, let me rematch Anderson (Silva) or somebody,\" Cormier said. \"You would have thought Jake Paul would go, 'You know what? I'm going to rematch Anderson, maybe I will find another mixed marital arts guy that's a little bit over the hill to try to fight where it's more safe and it's a more controlled environment because the problem with the Anthony Joshua fight is it wasn't controlled. It was just a fight. That's not Jake Paul, though. He immediately goes back after Francis Ngannou. It's crazy to me.\"\n\nWhen Gervonta Davis withdrew from his fight against Paul, \"The Problem Child\" called out Ngannou, but Ngannou wasn't interested. Joshua ended up taking the fight instead, which Cormier thinks would now make Ngannou open to fighting Paul.\n\nHowever, Cormier thinks it would be a bad idea for Paul.\n\n\"For as small as Jake looked against Anthony, he'll look equally as small against Francis Ngannou,\" Cormier said. \"But I think what's happening with Jake is he's wanting to show that Anthony Joshua didn't knock scared into him, which in reality he probably should have knocked a little scared into him.\n\n\"I just don't think (Paul) can hurt him. I just don't know that he can hurt Francis like he thinks he can hurt Francis. You can never question the boldness of Jake Paul. You could never question the toughness of Jake Paul. I question his smarts. I think he needs to reconsider.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: UFC analyst warns Jake Paul of calling out Francis Ngannou",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens’ 2025 campaign ended in utter disappointment as their 26-24 Week 18 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers cost them the division and a postseason appearance.\n\nSince there will be no more games for them to look forward to this season, Ravens fans have no choice but to look ahead to next season.\n\nNow that the 2025 regular season has concluded, Baltimore’s full list of opponents for the 2026 season has been officially determined.\n\nThe Ravens finished second in the AFC North – behind the Steelers – so they'll play a second-place schedule next season.\n\nAs is the case every season, the Ravens will play the other three teams in the division – the Steelers, Cincinnati Bengals and Cleveland Browns – twice – once at home and once on the road.\n\nIn all, Baltimore will have eight home games and nine road games in the ’26 season. Here’s the full breakdown:\n\nAfter an underwhelming season, the Ravens will have some major questions over the offseason. Will John Harbaugh still be on the sideline in Baltimore at the start of next season? We’ll have to wait and see. In the meantime, Baltimore’s full schedule for the ’26 season, including dates and times, will be released in the coming months.",

    "description": "The Bengals' offseason seems to be setting up exactly as needed: With every possible opportunity to focus on the defense.",
    "fullText": "It's early in the NFL offseason for teams that missed the playoffs, but the Cincinnati Bengals' offseason seems to be setting up exactly as needed: With every possible opportunity to focus on the defense.\n\nThat starts with continuity on the coaching staff, and the fact that Al Golden will likely return as the team's defensive coordinator. After receiving the backing of team owner and President Mike Brown earlier in the day, head coach Zac Taylor voiced his support for Golden during a Jan. 5 news conference at Paycor Stadium and said he did not plan any staff changes.\n\nPersonnel-wise, there's plenty of business the Bengals can get done on the offensive side of the ball, including extending the contracts of players like 1,000-yard running Chase Brown. But the key offensive cogs are locked up for next year. There aren't any nagging contract situations that must be addressed, such as the past mega-deals for players like quarterback Joe Burrow and receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins.\n\nMost of the other skill position players and offensive linemen are locked up contractually. And the one unsigned lineman many players would like to see return, and who has voiced interest in returning, is Dalton Risner. Risner confirmed his interest in returning to Cincinnati during a Jan. 4 interview with The Enquirer.\n\nOn the defensive side of the ball, there doesn't appear to be any lingering contract issues that would cast a pall on the offseason like Trey Hendrickson's did last year.\n\nIn short, the Bengals can pour much of their focus into the defense, which ended 2025 ranked No. 31 out of 32 teams in total defense.\n\n\"That’s the truth of it. There’s no real sugarcoating that. You got a bunch of (defensive) guys coming back,\" Taylor said. \"It’s exciting because you can focus your energy. There’s so many guys on that side of the ball that, really, their growth was accelerated over the last half of the year. You are really excited about their future here as starters (and) as role players. I feel like we are in a tremendous position going into this offseason.\n\n\"Our expectations are going to be sky high, and we are going to work like heck to meet those expectations. I think the players and coaches all see the direction we are headed. So there is a lot of positive energy heading into the offseason.\"\n\nTaylor on Jan. 5 continued to trumpet the statistical defensive improvement under Golden following Cincinnati's Nov. 9 bye week, although the team went 3-5 during that stretch and lost three one-score games. Bengals' offensive turnovers leading to opposition touchdowns also played a role in several of those games. Golden's unit didn't have much to do with those moments.\n\nTaylor also offered insight into a shorter runway for Golden to onboard with the Bengals following his run as Notre Dame's defensive coordinator for the College Football Playoff. That run ran all the way through to the National Championship game in Atlanta on Jan. 20, 2025. The Bengals then hired Golden and started to take meaningful steps in assembling the defensive coaching staff around him.\n\nThere were times it felt like the Bengals were one missed tackle or one play of some kind from winning. Instead, they more often than not let those games get away. Several players on Jan. 5 said they viewed that perspective as evidence the team is close.\n\nSimilarly, Taylor said he believed the defense was close to being where he needed it to be.\n\n\"I think that staff really worked hard to come together and get on the same page with scheme and how we're going to coach these guys,\" Taylor said. \"So, like anything, I saw great growth from that side of the ball. And they closed (by) giving up 18 points or something a game over the last eight games. And there's a lot of statistics I can read where it shows marked improvement. And so again, I like the direction that group is headed. I like the direction our team is headed. I know how it sounds when we come off the record we just had, but again, I've got a lot of excitement, and I'm excited to get back to work and get these guys ready for next year.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Zac Taylor said no Bengals' coaching staff changes are planned",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M landed its seventh transfer addition since the portal opened on Monday afternoon, securing its second offensive line commitment, as South Carolina guard Trovon Baugh will head to College Station this spring, and I can safely say that this one came out of nowhere. After landing LSU guard and former Texas A&M commit Coen Echols, head coach Mike Elko has added more beef in the trenches.\n\nWith starting left tackle Trey Zuhn, right guard Ar'maj Reed-Adams, and right tackle Dametreous Crownover all departing for the NFL Draft, landing two experienced offensive linemen was crucial before entering the spring season, while left guard Chase Bisontis has yet to decide his playing future. For those who aren't familiar with Baugh, he started 11 of 12 games at right guard for the Gamecocks last season, logging 611 snaps, while his overall performance is a mixed bag with more positives than negatives.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, Baugh earned average grades, but did finish the year with four 80-plus pass protection grades, and earned at least 50 or above grades as a run blocker, proving that there's still plenty of room for improvement. On paper, with Adams leaving, Baugh will likely compete with Coen Echols and sophomore guard Blake Ivy for the starting right guard spot.\n\nStanding at 6'3\" and 335 pounds, Baugh possesses NFL size and strength, but still needs to refine his technique to reach his full potential. Mike Elko has filled another gap in the roster.\n\nMore beef 🥩 \n\nWelcome to Aggieland, @BaughTrovon 👍 pic.twitter.com/To8BGNl1i2\n\n— TexAgs Recruiting (@TA_Recruiting) January 5, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M land commitment from South Carolina transfer OL Trovon Baugh",

    "fullText": "After a heartbreaking loss to Czechia last night, Vancouver Canucks prospect Braeden Cootes and Team Canada have won Bronze at the 2026 IIHF World Junior Championship, taking Finland down by a score of 6–3. This is Canada’s sixth bronze medal at the World Juniors and their 36th overall.\n\nThe past few World Junior Championships have been rough for Canada, as they have been eliminated from gold medal contention by Czechia for the past three straight years. Their last gold medal came in 2023, during which they took down none-other than Czechia to achieve the feat. Prior to this year, this was Canada’s last medal placement. The last time Canada placed third at the World Juniors was in 2012.\n\nThe 2026 World Junior Championship was an interesting one for Cootes, who played predominantly on Canada’s fourth line despite a decent showing at his team’s training camp. In today’s game, Cootes scored his second goal of the tournament and played in a total of 6:21 minutes. He finishes the tournament with two goals, seven shots on goal, and an average of 8:48 minutes played per game.\n\nWith Canada and Finland’s bronze-medal game now wrapped up, fans’ attention will turn to Canucks prospect Wilson Björck and Team Sweden as they take on Czechia for gold. Sweden’s last gold medal game appearance came in 2024, during which they lost 6–2 to Team USA. Canucks players Jonathan Lekkerimäki, Elias Pettersson (D), Tom Willander, Liam Öhgren, and Zeev Buium took part in this game.

    "description": "The Reds have a bright future.",
    "fullText": "The Cincinnati Reds feature a number of young players with high ceilings. It is easy to forget that Elly De La Cruz is still only 23 years old. Today, however, we are going to take a look at three of the Reds' top prospects and break down their skill sets, potential and MLB outlooks.\n\nStewart, a 22-year-old versatile infielder, made his MLB debut in 2025. He was also the Reds' top prospect in 2025, per MLB.com.\n\nStewart is known for his hitting prowess, while his defensive versatility makes him an especially intriguing prospect. He's developing as a power threat, and Stewart is a guy who could hit for a quality average at the big league level.\n\nBetween Double-A and Triple-A in 2025, Stewart slashed .309/.383/.525 while also recording a .907 OPS and 20 home runs. His 18 MLB games saw him hit .255/.293/.545 with five home runs and an .838 OPS.\n\nHe features the talent and potential to become the next star in Cincinnati.\n\nDuno, the No. 2 prospect for the Reds in 2025, is a 19-year-old catcher. With an MLB ETA of 2028, Duno is still working toward becoming big league ready. It would not be surprising to see him become the team's catcher of the future down the road, though.\n\nIn 2025 at Single-A, Duno slashed .287/.430/.518 to go along with 18 home runs and a .948 OPS. While it was only Single-A ball, Duno is seemingly ready for the next level given his performance.\n\nWhile his offensive ability is clearly trending in the right direction, Duno's throwing arm from behind the plate may be the best facet of his game. Opponents are going to have a difficult time attempting to steal bases with Duno as the backstop.\n\nLewis, a 19-year-old shortstop who was the Reds' No. 3 overall prospect in 2025, may have to switch positions at some point in the future with De La Cruz at shortstop with the MLB team. An athletic infielder who stands 6'2\", a position move would likely not be an issue for Lewis.\n\nHe has a good arm, but his defense is still a work-in-progress. Lewis is still progressing offensively, but his 2025 performance was impressive. He slashed .311/.376/.486 with an .862 OPS, nine home runs and 27 stolen bases at Single-A.\n\nLewis is going to steal bases. The question is whether or not he will hit at a consistent enough level to become a star at the big league level. If he does turn into a respectable offensive presence, Lewis should have a bright future with the Reds moving forward.",

    "fullText": "MANHATTAN — Right when you thought Kansas State football might be done for the day, the Wildcats landed a seventh commitment from the transfer portal on Monday, Jan. 5.\n\nGardner-Webb defensive tackle De'Arieun Hicks committed to K-State, according to On3's Pete Nakos. The 6-foot-4, 285-pounder has three years of eligibility and totaled 21 tackles, with 4.5 being for a loss in 2025.\n\nHicks reportedly had a visit to Iowa State on Monday, after spending Jan. 3 with the Wildcats, and he chose to play football in Manhattan.\n\nHicks was a standout for the FCS program out of the Big South, playing 373 snaps and making four starts on the Runnin' Bulldogs' defensive line. He was the Big South's sixth-highest graded defensive lineman, according to Pro Football Focus, with the league's 12th-best pass rush grade.\n\nHicks totaled 10 pressures, with seven quarterback hurries and a pair of sacks across 12 games.\n\nOut of high school in Richmond, Indiana, Hicks wasn't given a grade by 247Sports.\n\nKansas State was in desperate need of defensive linemen from the transfer portal following the departures of Malcolm Alcorn-Crowder and Andy Burburija, the latter of whom reopened his recruitment after initially signing with the Wildcats. The Wildcats also signed Adrian Bekibele, Kingston Hall and Carnell Jackson Jr. during December's signing period.\n\nHicks' size is certainly appealing, giving the Wildcats a solid prospect to develop. Given the Wildcats' need at the position, Hicks could have an opportunity to get on the field quickly.\n\nHicks joins Oklahoma State running back Rodney Fields Jr., Texas A&M receiver Izaiah Williams, Illinois corner Kaleb Patterson, Oklahoma State linebacker Jacobi Oliphant, Miami (Ohio) safety Koy Beasley and Missouri offensive lineman Keiton Jones as those who committed to the Wildcats on Monday.\n\nWyatt D.

Speculation has been mounting, at least among the public, about whether or not the franchise should bring Bowles back for a fifth season in charge following another 8-9 season and missing the playoffs for the first time since 2019.\n\nThere is at least one group of people that is fully supportive of Bowles and that is the players of the Buccaneers organization.\n\nThat starts with one of the anchors of the offensive line, offensive tackle Tristan Wirfs.\n\n“I love coach Bowles,” Wirfs said about Bowles. “I see all the talk on Twitter, I really don't care about it — it's just people sitting at home, talking about it. We know what we have in this building. If something happens, something happens, if something doesn't, something doesn't. The season is coming regardless, and we're all gonna be ready.”\n\nTristan Wirfs speaks on the future of Todd Bowles with Bucs. \n\n“I see all of the talk on Twitter. I really don’t care about it. \n\nIf something happens, something happens. If something doesn’t, something doesn’t.” pic.twitter.com/2CPVlFk2Ey\n\n— Logan B. Robinson (@LogansTwitty) January 5, 2026\n\nAnother player that added support for Bowles coming back is second-year wide receiver Jalen McMillan, who battled a neck injury throughout the season.\n\n“He's a great leader,” McMillan said, via River Wells. “He's somebody who shows up to work every day and he's going to give you the same type of effort, every day. He's my guy. I love him to death. Hopefully, he stays here.”\n\nJalen McMillan on increasing chatter on Todd Bowles’ job security:\n\n“He’s my guy. I love him to death. I hope he stays here.” pic.twitter.com/5YKeeE2Dgj\n\n— River Wells (@riverhwells) January 5, 2026\n\nIt was a disappointing finish for the Buccaneers. After a 5-1 start and a 6-2 first half of the season, the wheels completely fell off and the Buccaneers would win just two of their last nine games.\n\nThey finished the season with a win over the Carolina Panthers but the Atlanta Falcons, who are also now looking for a head coach after firing Raheem Morris Sunday, then defeated the New Orleans Saints on Sunday to create a three-way tie atop the NFC South, a tie that did not favor the Buccaneers and left them on the outside looking in.\n\nAs a result, they will now look ahead to the draft with the 15th overall pick. The question is whether or not Bowles will help make that draft pick.\n\nHis players clearly want him to stay. But ultimately, ownership has the final say. It’s looking more like the team will keep Bowles for another season, but things can change quickly.",

He wasn’t going to let his career end that way, and he was motivated that night to return to play with the only franchise he’s ever known.\n\nAfter the Raiders' loss, however, he was much more split. He explained that he doesn’t know at the moment when he will decide what he will do for the rest of the year regarding football.\n\nOne of the most successful players on and off the field, Kelce is scheduled to marry his partner, world pop star Taylor Swift, this coming June in Rhode Island.\n\nHe also hosts one of the most popular podcasts in North America, “New Heights” with his brother, retired NFL lineman and fellow Super Bowl champion Jason Kelce.\n\nEven Travis’ mother, Donna, is set to make her big television debut in only a few days on “The Traitors,” a competitive reality show produced by NBC on Peacock.\n\nWe will keep you updated on Kelce’s decision on whether he will play his 14th season in the NFL or if Sunday was his last dance.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Did Travis Kelce Retire From NFL, Chiefs After Week 18 Loss?",

    "fullText": "EAGAN, Minn. (AP) — The Minnesota Vikings lost their bet this season that they could develop J.J. McCarthy and still win at the same time, with a roster strong enough to withstand the typical inconsistencies of a young quarterback in his debut.\n\nThe worst part of their failed gamble for 2025 was that it left plenty more mystery for 2026. The Vikings have begun a new year with yet another quarterback quandary, a familiar scenario for this star-crossed franchise.\n\nAsked after the final game on Sunday if he would be comfortable entering next season with McCarthy as the starter, coach Kevin O'Connell sidestepped the question.\n\n“I can’t wait to work with him in the offseason and absolutely look forward to the continued development and improvement,\" O'Connell said, \"and I’m excited where he’s ending the season and know there’s some things we can really dive into as a group.”\n\nThe Vikings made sure not to miss out on the record quarterback rush at the top of the 2024 draft, confidently selecting McCarthy with the 10th pick as the promising prospect for their reputable system they could mold into a long-term fixture at this vital and vexing position.\n\nBut his injuries have put them behind on the evaluation. The fact that he has only started 10 games and finished eight over his first two years is the most concerning of any metric. Even when he was healthy, the struggles with accuracy were pronounced enough to make them consider alternatives despite the significant upside on display.\n\nAfter winging it with Carson Wentz and Max Brosmer as the backups, at the very least the Vikings realize they need better depth if they're going to run McCarthy back next season. McCarthy, for his part, sounded aware that his hold on the starting job is tenuous, too.\n\n\"There’s nothing promised. That’s something I take very seriously. It’s not something you buy and you get for the rest of your life. You rent it and you lease it every single day, and I’m just trying to make daily deposits and make sure I’m in this house for a long time.”\n\nFinishing with a five-game winning streak put the Vikings (9-8) a half-game behind Green Bay for the last spot even though they were eliminated before taking the field in Week 14.\n\nConsider this: If the Vikings just had better coverage on their kickoff after McCarthy's go-ahead touchdown pass in the final minute in Week 11, when Devin Duvernay's 56-yard return set Chicago up for the walk-off field goal, they would've won that game — and the NFC North title.\n\n“It’s going to sting not being in the tournament for not only our team and the work that they’ve put in, but our fan base and our ownership,” O'Connell said.\n\nThe Vikings still took third in the division on a tiebreaker over Detroit, meaning a road game next season against San Francisco (12-5) instead of Arizona (3-14) from the NFC West and home games against Indianapolis (8-9) instead of Tennessee (3-14) from the AFC South and Washington (5-12) instead of New York (4-13) from the NFC East.\n\nThe Vikings were able to get Justin Jefferson past the 1,000-yard mark for the sixth straight season to start his career, but the fact that he needed all 17 games to do that was ultimately one of many poor statistical reflections on this once-potent offense.\n\nThe Vikings were last in the NFL in turnovers, interceptions and third down conversions and second-to-last in sack percentage.\n\nThe Vikings had another stellar performance under the direction of defensive coordinator Brian Flores, finishing second in red zone touchdown rate and sack percentage and third in the league in yards allowed. They were seventh in points against, one of only two teams in the top 13 in the NFL to miss the playoffs, along with Kansas City.\n\nFlores will again be a candidate for head coach vacancies around the league, and his contract is expiring, too, raising the question about whether he will return. The scene at U.S. Bank Stadium on Sunday felt like a farewell to 14-year veteran safety Harrison Smith, too. Salary cap management will likely force the Vikings to move from one or both of the veteran defensive linemen they signed this season, Jonathan Allen and Javon Hargrave.\n\nThe quarterback search will be complicated by an unfavorable salary cap situation, with the Vikings carrying the second-highest projected overage in the league into the offseason and thus needing to shed multiple important players before they can add new ones. More depth is needed on the offensive line, too, with the future of center Ryan Kelly in doubt after multiple concussions.\n\nIn the draft, they have the 18th pick in the first round and still possess their original second and third-round selections. They currently own five third-day picks and are in line to be awarded mid-round compensatory selections for the departure of free agent quarterbacks Sam Darnold and Daniel Jones last year.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "The Houston Rockets expect to be without All-Star center Alperen Şengün for up to two weeks.\n\nŞengün went down with a right ankle injury very early in the team’s 110-104 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday. While he doesn’t have a specific timeline for his return — the team is planning to evaluate Şengün again in the coming days — head coach Ime Udoka confirmed Monday that Şengün will likely miss up to two weeks.\n\n“We’ll evaluate him at the end of the week,” Udoka said, via Sports Illustrated’s Lachard Binkley. “Need to get the swelling, the pain tolerance down and mobility, but you’re looking at a probably 10-14 days type thing.”\n\n[Get more Rockets news: Houston team feed]\n\nRoughly a minute into the game Saturday at the American Airlines Center, Şengün went up to try to fight for a defensive rebound against Mavericks center Daniel Gafford. As Şengün came down, his right ankle rolled hard. That sent him crashing to the court, where he remained until play stopped at the other end.\n\nThis is the play where Alperen Sengun got hurt, rolling his right ankle when landing on a rebound attempt. https://t.co/vEohvYuD61 pic.twitter.com/VVxGTjqmQh\n\n— ClutchFans (@clutchfans) January 4, 2026\n\nŞengün eventually limped off the court and was quickly ruled out of the game.\n\nHe is in the middle of a career season with the Rockets. The 23-year-old, who made his first All-Star Game last year, has put up a career-high 21.8 points this season while averaging 9 rebounds and 6.5 assists.\n\nWhile this will interrupt his dominant start to the season, and Şengün has a history of ankle injuries, the timeline this time seems relatively minor. If Şengün is out the full two weeks, he'd be back in time for the team’s matchup with the San Antonio Spurs on Jan. 20, meaning he would miss eight games.\n\nThe Rockets enter Monday night’s contest against the Phoenix Suns with a 21-11 record, which has them fifth in the Western Conference standings. Saturday’s loss to the Mavericks snapped a four-game winning streak.",

Are teams hamstringing their playoff chances in a salary-capped league by paying premiums for quarterbacks? Is it too difficult in the modern NFL to build a competitive roster around a quarterback playing on a premium salary?\n\nQuarterback is the most important position in football, if not in all of sports. It's difficult to win a Super Bowl without a high-end signal caller, though Super Bowls have been won with Nick Foles, Jeff Hostetler, Jim Plunkett, Brad Johnson and Trent Dilfer.\n\nBut having a Patrick Mahomes, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning or Joe Montana is historically the best ingredient for success. And they cost money.\n\nHere's a look at the salaries of starting quarterbacks for all 32 NFL teams, grouped by whether or not they made the playoffs. Players with a top-10 salary are in bold.\n\nCaleb Williams: $9.9 million (rookie contract)\n\nBryce Young: $9.5 million (rookie contract)\n\nDrake Maye: $9.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nC.J. Stroud: $9.1 million (rookie contract)\n\nBo Nix: $4.7 million (rookie contract)\n\nDak Prescott, Cowboys: $60 million\n\nJoe Burrow, Bengals: $55 million\n\nTua Tagovailoa, Dolphins: $53.1 million\n\nLamar Jackson, Ravens: $52 million\n\nKyler Murray, Cardinals: $46.1 million\n\nKirk Cousins, Falcons: $45 million\n\nPatrick Mahomes, Chiefs: $45 million\n\nGeno Smith, Raiders: $37.5 million\n\nBaker Mayfield, Buccaneers: $33.3 million\n\nJustin Fields, Jets: $20 million\n\nDaniel Jones, Colts: $14 million\n\nCam Ward, Titans: $12.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nJayden Daniels, Commanders: $9.4 million (rookie contract)\n\nJ.J. McCarthy, Vikings: $5.5 million (rookie contract)\n\nJaxson Dart, Giants: $4.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nTyler Shough, Saints: $2.7 million (rookie contract)\n\nShedeur Sanders, Browns: $1.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nIt's notable that five of the 12 playoff quarterbacks are playing on rookie contracts, which are capped by the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nThat cost control is extremely valuable, and optimizing roster construction around rookie quarterback contracts is a proven formula for success. Since the inception of the rookie wage scale in 2011, the Seattle Seahawks with Russell Wilson (2014 season) and the Kansas City Chiefs with Mahomes (2019 season) have navigated the rookie wage scale to Super Bowl victories.\n\nThis, season, the Patriots have an MVP candidate in Maye who's the ninth-highest paid player on the team. Nix playing on a $4.7 million salary has allowed the Broncos to build a Super Bowl contender despite Wilson's disastrous contract remaining on the books.\n\nStroud, meanwhile is a veteran quarterback in his third season who's surrounded by one of the NFL's fiercest defenses. It would not be a surprise to see any of them playing in or winning the Super Bowl in January.\n\nThis is an optimal way to build a Super contender in the short window available to pay quarterbacks on a rookie contract. This, of course, requires hitting successfully on a quarterback in the draft who can lead a team to contention at a young age.\n\nAnd it's also, obviously, not the only path to success. Thirteen of the 15 Super Bowls won since the inception of the rookie wage scale have been won by quarterbacks not playing on a rookie deal.\n\nAt some point, those rookie quarterbacks will be due for extensions. And if you've got a high-end quarterback on your hands who's due to be paid, there's little choice but to pay him. And that doesn't mean that you can't build a successful roster around said quarterback.\n\nYes, half of the top 10 paid quarterbacks will be watching the playoffs from home. But it's a little absurd to suggest that that's an indictment of paying top quarterbacks their market value.\n\nBurrow missed most of the season due to injury. Do the Bengals have also roster construction issues? Absolutely. But that's an issue that's plagued the franchise for pretty much the entirety of its existence under Brown family ownership, with or without a premium quarterback on the roster.\n\nThe Cowboys likewise have roster concerns that limited their upside. Like with the Bengals, it's fairer to take a look at the decades-long management under Jerry Jones (and the defense specifically this year) than point to the $60 million salary of Prescott, who was excellent this season, to explain why the Cowboys aren't in the playoffs.\n\nIt's difficult to argue that the Lions and Ravens didn't build strong rosters around Goff and Jackson. There's talent on both sides of the ball on both teams outside of their quarterbacks. And Jackson was clearly limited by injuries this season, while the Lions were ravaged by injuries of their own.\n\nIn the end, 14 of the league's 32 teams make the playoffs. The Ravens and Lions just missed out, but it wouldn't be a surprise for either or both to return to contention next season.\n\nAnd then there's Tagovailoa. His contract at this point was pretty clearly a mistake. He got benched at the end of the season, and his time in Miami very well may be done. The Dolphins would surely take a do-over on his deal of they could.\n\nBut the Prescott, Jackson, Burrow and Goff deals? There are surely no regrets from their respective franchises. Teams without high-end quarterbacks would certainly jump at the chance to take their contracts on.",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich’s reported long-standing interest in Crystal Palace defender Marc Guéhi could hit a snag: another top European club could beat it to the punch this month.\n\nThe German Rekordmeister had been tipped for contract talks with the English international, who is now in the final six months of his current deal and free to negotiate with other clubs as a free agent. However, a run of injuries to Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City defense has created the possibility of an immediate transfer, according to reporting in the BBC.\n\nManchester City are exploring a move for Marc Guéhi this month, in the wake of defenders Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias suffering injuries. Bayern, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Inter and Atlético are among the European clubs to have shown an interest in signing Guéhi on a free transfer. Liverpool remain heavily interested. It is understood Crystal Palace would consider selling Guéhi this month to avoid the scenario of losing their captain for nothing come the end of the season. Market regulations mean he can sign a pre-agreement with an overseas club from this month [@SamiMokbel_BBC, @BBCSport]\n\nMan City has dropped points again this weekend, this time to Chelsea, and is seeing its campaign to keep the pressure on Arsenal falter. The Gunners sit six points atop the league after 20 matchdays. Guéhi surely would not come cheap, but the incentives are aligning for all parties involved — and Bayern is in no position at the moment to throw in a bid. If Pep wants Guéhi, it is hard to see this not happening.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "fullText": "After a difficult 14 months, Manchester United finally pulled the trigger on the Ruben Amorim era.\n\nWhile results have been underwhelming from the start, things came to a head after the head coach’s explosive comments following the Leeds game.\n\nHe called out director of football Jason Wilcox, while hinting at a lack of control both in terms of incomings as well as when choosing his style of play.\n\nAnd after holding a meeting early on Monday to review what the Portuguese tactician said, INEOS finally decided to pull the plug.\n\nFormer United midfielder and current U18s boss Darren Fletcher has taken over on an interim basis, with Wilcox preparing a list of managerial targets.\n\nThe reliable Gianluca Di Marzio has revealed that recently-sacked Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca is on the Red Devils’ radar.\n\nHis record in the Premier League with both City and Chelsea and the fact that he is a free agent should do his chances of taking over at Old Trafford a world of good.\n\nHe guided the Stamford Bridge side to the Conference League and Club World Cup titles, while also helping City win a treble in the 22/23 season.\n\nThe Italian manager’s connection with Omar Berrada could prove key, as the United CEO was the one who had brought him back to the Etihad to be Pep Guardiola’s assistant.\n\nInterestingly, the report also reveals that the club will hold a meeting to discuss the viability of all the potential candidates on Tuesday.\n\n“Enzo Maresca is also on Manchester United’s list to replace Rúben Amorim.\n\n“The Red Devils are now looking for another candidate to fill the bench and on the list is also Enzo Maresca, who finished his 2025 contract at Chelsea but is now free.\n\n“CEO Omar Berrada already has a strong connection with the Italian manager, as he was the one who brought him to Manchester City as Guardiola’s assistant.\n\n“On Tuesday 6 January, Man Utd should resolve their doubts about the various candidates (Glasner is also among them).”\n\nAs relayed by The Peoples Person, United played a part in Maresca’s sacking. Now, after destabilising the Blues, United could land their ex-manager in one fell swoop.\n\nIt looked a certainty that the ex-Leicester City boss was heading back to Manchester City to replace Guardiola ahead of next summer, but United could offer an immediate job opportunity.\n\nFeature image Clive Mason via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Carlie Irsay-Gordon liked what she saw during her first 10 games as the Indianapolis Colts' co-owner.\n\nQuarterback Daniel Jones and running back Jonathan Taylor played at MVP levels, coach Shane Steichen's offense operated at a historically efficient clip and general manager Chris Ballard pulled the trigger on a midseason trade to fill the team's most glaring need.\n\nThen Jones tried to play through a fractured lower left leg, suffered a torn right Achilles tendon and the season unraveled quickly as a season-ending seven-game losing streak knocked Indy (8-9) out of the playoffs again.\n\nYet in her most significant move since taking over the franchise's day-to-day operations from her late father, Jim, Irsay-Gordon ignored the urge — and the calls from some fans — to fire Ballard and Steichen and instead decided to give them another chance to replicate their early season success.\n\n“We have been very clear with Chris and Shane that giving them another opportunity means that the sense of urgency for them to deliver and perform has never been higher,” Irsay-Gordon said. “Chris and Shane are both capable of facing this challenge head on and finding a way to achieve the results our fans deserve, which is winning games, getting to the postseason and ultimately winning championships.”\n\nIt might have been easier for Irsay-Gordon to explain if she moved on from Ballard, who has two playoff appearances and one postseason win in his nine-year tenure, or Steichen, who's 25-26 in three seasons and has never made it to the playoffs. Or perhaps both following the historic second-half collapse.\n\nIndy became the first team since the 1995 Oakland Raiders and just the sixth since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger to start 8-2 and not make the postseason.\n\nIrsay-Gordon blames injuries for the second-half failures.\n\nIn addition to Jones, the Colts lost two-time All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner for most of the final five games because of a strained calf, 2023 All-Pro cornerback Charvarius Ward for most of the second half because of two concussions and three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle DeForest Buckner for six of the final seven games because of a neck injury. The result: Indy's skid included four losses by six or fewer points.\n\nAnd for that reason, Irsay-Gordon didn't see the need to start over in 2026. She said she made that decision last week.\n\n“What we saw in that first half, we were on a record pace, dominating offensively,” she said. “I think we just have to be able to face adversity better, and I believe in the team. I believe in the team and hope to stay healthier next season.”\n\nBallard again finds himself entering an offseason dealing with questions about the sport's most important position.\n\nBefore the injury, Jones was expected to cash in on a comeback season with a big-dollar contract. Instead, he'll enter free agency for a second straight season dealing with questions about his injury history and how quickly he'll return to the field — likely decreasing his price tag.\n\n“I'd love to be back here,” Jones said. “I think it's a great organization and I've enjoyed being here. Obviously, there's a business side to it and I understand that, but I've really enjoyed being around these people.”\n\nSteichen and Ballard also must decide what to do with the oft-injured Anthony Richardson, the No. 4 pick in the 2023 draft, who lost the starting job in training camp and wasn't even active after mid-October after fracturing the orbital bone near his eye in a bizarre pregame accident.\n\nIn his first two seasons, receiver Alec Pierce struggled to make a consistent impact. The last two years, he has produced the highest per-catch average among the league's qualifiers.\n\nNow the soon-to-be free agency is likely to cash in. Pierce had 47 catches, his first 1,000-yard season (1,003) for a 21.3-yard average with six TDs this season while establishing himself as a favorite for three starting quarterbacks — Jones, 44-year-old Philip Rivers and rookie Riley Leonard.\n\n“I guess it's more like being recruited because you actually have a say in it now,” Pierce said. “It's ultimately my decision.”\n\nWard had three concussions in his first season with Indy, and the second — suffered in a pregame collision with tight end Drew Ogletree — prompted Ward to contemplate retirement.\n\nHe might be going through that process again after finishing the season on injured reserve with his third concussion.\n\n“I've got to talk to my family,” Ward said. “If I walk away, I feel like I'd be happy. I'd have won a Super Bowl, made a whole lot of money, made the Pro Bowl, made All-Pro. I did everything I wanted to. So I feel like if I walk away, I won't regret it. I'm good.\"\n\nIrsay-Gordon made it clear the sense of urgency next year is even higher next season and her comment is likely to resonate throughout the offseason as Ballard contemplates future moves. Steichen said he'll contemplate what went wrong late in games, late in the season and how he can get the Colts back to the postseason.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

The Dolphins could release him with a post-June 1 designation at the start of the new league year to split his $99.2 million cap charge over two years.\n\n\"In 2026, I think there will be competition for our starting quarterback,\" McDaniel said. \"What that is and how it looks, that remains to be seen.

    "fullText": "Patriots quarterback Drake Maye had an impressive regular season and is in the running for MVP, which left former New England wide receiver Julian Edelman naming his favorite thing about Maye’s game.\n\n“His attitude,” Edelman said Monday on “The Herd”. “Just talking to people over there, everyone just talks about how he is so hungry to be coached and to learn, and it translates to how he is playing. He looks so confident. He makes it look so easy.”\n\nMaye is just in his second season in the NFL, but he plays like a seasoned veteran every week. Although he is still young and lacks postseason experience, the Patriots shouldn’t be counted out in the playoffs.\n\nThe AFC is lacking a lot of veteran quarterbacks in this postseason, with Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow sitting at home. Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen could be the quarterback to beat in the AFC. However, Maye already beat him once this season and should’ve beaten him again.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Maye performs in the postseason. If he plays as he did throughout the season, there’s a strong chance that New England could be on its way to the Super Bowl.\n\nDrake Maye Makes His Case For Why He Deserves To Be NFL MVP",

    "description": "A peculiar stat could unlock an Andrew Mangiapane trade for the Oilers. Other teams might see his struggles as opportunity.",
    "fullText": "Trade speculation around Andrew Mangiapane is heating up, and Elliotte Friedman believes it’s only a matter of time before the Edmonton Oilers move the winger. While the fit in Edmonton hasn’t worked as hoped, Friedman suggests a deal is very doable based on analytics, contract value, and league-wide interest.\n\nSpeaking on 32 Thoughts, Friedman noted Mangiapane’s poor PDO — often viewed as a “luck” stat — could actually help the Oilers. Friedman wonders whether another team might see Mangiapane’s struggles as more circumstantial than skill-related, suggesting that another organization could view him as a bounce-back candidate. With one year remaining at $3.6 million, Friedman doesn’t expect Edmonton to have much trouble finding a trade partner.\n\nTo date, the Ducks have been linked, but new names recently popped up on Monday, suggesting the Detroit Red Wings and Winnipeg Jets might also be a fit.\n\nFriedman compared Mangiapane’s situation to Mason Marchment, a player who struggled in one stop before thriving elsewhere. Sometimes players need a change of scenery, and Mangiapane has a proven scoring history that remains valuable.\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks have surfaced as a possible landing spot, largely due to their cap flexibility and recent struggles. Friedman believes Anaheim may look to add or retain veterans, especially with Frank Vatrano sidelined long-term, to help stabilize a young roster.\n\nWith that in mind, Friedman poured cold water on rumors involving Ryan Strome coming back to Edmonton. Strome earns roughly $1.5 million more than Mangiapane, and the Oilers don’t have the cap space to make that work. More importantly, Strome isn’t the type of bottom-six, role-accepting player Edmonton is targeting.\n\nInstead, the Oilers are reportedly seeking a grinder-type forward willing to play limited minutes and embrace a depth role — something Mangiapane has been trending toward but seems less-than-thrilled about doing. It's reportedly why he's open to a trade in the first place -- to go where there is more opportunity to play a more prominent role.\n\nToronto has also been loosely connected due to Brad Treliving’s history with Mangiapane, but Friedman doesn’t see that as a realistic option.\n\nBottom line: Edmonton will find a landing spot for Mangiapane. The only question is where and when.\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Edmonton Oilers team site to never miss the latest news, game-day coverage, and more.   Add us to your Google News favourites, and never miss a story.",

    "fullText": "Former Baylor redshirt sophomore defensive tackle DK Kalu has committed to the Florida Gators.\n\nKalu announced his decision on Monday, Jan. 5, joining former teammate DJ Coleman in moving from Baylor to Florida. A consensus three-star prospect out of high school, Kalu redshirted in 2023 after not seeing any action as a true freshman. He played three games as a reserve defensive lineman in 2024, making one start and recording one solo tackle.\n\nIn 2025, Kalu played 281 total snaps, earning a 59.7 offensive grade, a 61.5 run-defense grade, a 68.4 tackling grade (49th among Big 12 defensive linemen) and a 54.0 pass-rushing grade from Pro Football Focus. He played in nine games, starting six, recording 11 total tackles (four solo) and 0.5 tackles for a loss.\n\n247Sports ranks Kalu No. 705 overall and No. 48 among defensive linemen in the 2026 transfer cycle. On3 has him at No. 684 and No. 75, respectively.\n\nHe was on campus this weekend for an official visit.\n\nCommitted 🐊 pic.twitter.com/WU9S8wrBkV\n\n— DK Kalu🇳🇬🤴🏿 (@dk_kalu) January 5, 2026\n\nFollowing transfer portal losses, including starter Michai Boireau, the Gators have five defensive linemen in 2026. Redshirt senior Jamari Lyons has starting potential, as does redshirt junior Brendan Bett. Kalu is a depth addition, but he will compete for a starting job. Florida also returns Joseph Mbatchou and Jeramiah McCloud, and freshman Kendall Guervil recently signed as well.\n\nThe dilemma is that Boireau primarily played nose tackle for Florida last year, which none of the names mentioned above have much experience at. Lyons could step into that role, opening the door for Bett and Kalu to rotate alongside him. Florida could also add another defensive lineman from the transfer portal.\n\nAt 6-foot-4-inches, 309 pounds, Kalu provides size and depth to the position room.\n\nKalu is the fourth official transfer portal addition of the 2026 cycle for Florida, following Baylor safety DJ Coleman, James Madison tight end Lacota Dippre and Georgia Tech wide receiver Bailey Stockton.\n\nFlorida is also expected to land Georgia Tech quarterback Aaron Philo and interior offensive lineman Harrison Moore.\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida Gators football earns commitment from Baylor DT DK Kalu",

The thing is, he'll be on the job.\n\nAs revealed on Monday, franchise great Greg Olsen will be on FOX's broadcast team for this weekend's playoff game from Bank of America Stadium. Olsen, as usual, will be joined by play-by-by commentator Joe Davis and sideline reporter Pam Oliver.\n\nBefore becoming an Emmy Award-winning color analyst, Olsen played nine of his 14 NFL seasons with the Panthers. The former three-time Pro Bowl tight end finished up as the Carolina's third all-time leading pass catcher, amassing 6,463 receiving yards between 2011 and 2019.\n\nOlsen, perhaps fittingly, was a part of the Panthers' last playoff team—back in 2017. That trip ended in a wild-card round loss to the New Orleans Saints, where Olsen reeled in eight catches for 107 yards and a touchdown.\n\nThis will mark Olsen's fourth time covering the Panthers this season, with his last assignment coming in the team's Week 9 victory over the Green Bay Packers.\n\nFollow @ThePanthersWire on Twitter/X for more Panthers content.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Panthers Wire: Announcers for Panthers' wild-card game vs. Rams are revealed",

    "fullText": "Transfer Portal season may be in full swing, but high school football recruiting won’t be slowing down this winter, either.\n\nAttention has nearly turned in full to the 2027 cycle. All-American games will round out this month and then it’ll be on to camp season. Visits will be taken and early commitments will be made. Looking at the top EDGE prospects in the cycle, many are already off the board.\n\nAs of Jan. 5, eight of the 32 blue-chip EDGE recruits in the 2027 cycle are committed. That includes the No. 2 prospect at the position in five-star David Jacobs, who made a last-second pivot to Ohio State on Dec. 29. Below is a look at the top committed EDGEs early on in the cycle.\n\nSchool: Blessed Trinity Catholic (Ga.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 10 NATL. (No. 2 EDGE)\n\nOn his commitment: “I love everything about Ohio State,” Jacobs told Rivals’ Chad Simmons. “I was there for the Rutgers game and that visit really blew me away. The coaches, the players, and the atmosphere made a big impact on me. I knew about Ohio State and had been following them for a long time, but that visit showed me a lot.”\n\nSchool: Irmo (S.C.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 34 NATL. (No. 5 EDGE)\n\nOn his commitment: “Coach (Sterling) Lucas is a coach I trust and believe in,” Bryant told Simmons. “South Carolina wasn’t one of my first offers, but he was recruiting me before that. He started recruiting me early, and he’s like family. He’s easy to talk to, we have a nice relationship, and he’s always been a coach I knew I would love to play for … LSU has a storied history. They’ve always developed players, and it’s a good school with a lot of success.”\n\nSchool: Vigor (Ala.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 88 NATL. (No. 10 EDGE)\n\nOn his commitment: “I’m still open with my options,” Garror told Rivals’ Adam Gorney in November. “Just waiting it out and talking with everyone that I can.”\n\nVia Gorney: “There are three main contenders working to flip the Mobile Vigor standout with Auburn, Florida State and Texas A&M being the biggest threats to Alabama in his recruitment.”\n\nSchool: Cy Falls (Texas)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 115 NATL. (No. 17 EDGE)\n\nOn his commitment: “After the first and second visits, I got to really talk to Coach Elko and the whole staff and they really expressed how much they wanted me,” McCarty told Rivals’ Sam Spiegelman. “Coach (Jay) Bateman, Coach (Sean) Spencer and Coach Tony (Jerod-Eddie) all played roles. They just pushed the hardest and they know that I’m a family person — and they got the closest with my family.”\n\nSchool: Wayzata (Minn.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 119 NATL. (No. 18 EDGE)\n\nScout’s Take: “Eli Diane is one that we really ranked high in our initial rankings and we continue to like what we see from the Minnesota commit. A lot of the tools we like to see from prospects at his position, we could see where he could continue to grow and become a defensive lineman long-term. A ton of developmental upside there, we like the film and feel like he’s just scratching the surface on his potential.”\n\nSchool: Muskegon (Mich.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 126 NATL. (No. 19 EDGE)\n\nOn Michigan: “We went to a lot of colleges and, when we got there, it was different,” Kitchen told The Wolverine’s Ethan McDowell in September. “Everybody was huge. They were really hitting out there, really putting in work and it was just different.”\n\nSchool: Ridgeline (Utah)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 135 NATL. (No. 20 EDGE)\n\nOn his commitment: “It was in the back of my head for the last month-and-a-half with the communication they’ve had and just seeing their defense and how crazy it is these past few years,” Jones told Rivals’ Adam Gorney. “Looking back on the coaches and how they develop kids and how I could trust myself in their hands to get me to where I want to be.”\n\nSchool: Grimsley (N.C.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 282 NATL. (No. 28 EDGE)\n\nRogers on new VT head coach James Franklin: “It changes some things for me,” he told Rivals. “I’m sure they will reach back out and Blacksburg is still my first love. I would love it make it work again with them if possible … “It’s definitely a great hire. I’ve heard nothing but great things about him.”",

    "description": "Mike McDaniel's job as head coach of the Miami Dolphins appears to be safe for now.  “Listen, I was hired here to not just be the head coach,” McDaniel said Monday, a day after the Dolphins were blown out at New England to finish the season 7-10.  “I was hired to return a storied franchise to winning regular-season games, playoff games and Super Bowls.”",
    "fullText": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Mike McDaniel's job as head coach of the Miami Dolphins appears to be safe for now. He knows that will only remain true if he produces the results he was hired for in 2022.\n\n“Listen, I was hired here to not just be the head coach,” McDaniel said Monday, a day after the Dolphins were blown out at New England to finish the season 7-10. “I was hired to return a storied franchise to winning regular-season games, playoff games and Super Bowls.”\n\nThe latter two have not happened. And after another season of failed expectations in which the Dolphins missed the playoffs for the second straight year, they enter another offseason of uncertainty, starting with who'll be their next general manager and starting quarterback in 2026.\n\nMcDaniel, who is 35-32 in four seasons as Miami's coach, indicated Monday that he will be part of the decision-making in both processes. Though he did not specifically say he has been told by Dolphins ownership that he's returning next season — nor has the team made an official announcement — McDaniel said he has spoken with owner Stephen Ross.\n\n“I know one thing, every day that I'm employed by the Miami Dolphins as the head coach, I'm solely focused on doing what I was hired here to do,” McDaniel said. \"Eventually, like everybody else in this league, you're not entitled to this position. If I'm not able to win regular-season games, playoff games and Super Bowls, eventually the job won't be mine.\n\n\"And I think that is the nature of the NFL, and shame on you if you expect anything else.”\n\nThe Dolphins parted ways with longtime general manager Chris Grier on Oct. 31 following a loss to the Baltimore Ravens that dropped them to 2-7. Dolphins senior personnel executive Champ Kelly has been Miami's interim GM since, and the team recently brought in Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman to aid in its GM search.\n\n“I'm going to be a part of the (interview) process,” McDaniel said, “and beyond that, I think the main objective and what everyone's counting on is that we have a cohesive crew of people that are working in the same direction. I'm happy to support all of that. It's not my decision to make, nor do I think that would be an intelligent way to go about business.”\n\nBeyond front office decisions, the Dolphins will need to figure out what they're going to do at quarterback after Tua Tagovailoa was benched for the final three games of the season because of poor play.\n\nMcDaniel said Monday there will be a quarterback competition to determine Miami's 2026 starter, and he will meet with Tagovailoa on Tuesday morning to discuss the season.\n\nTagovailoa threw for 2,660 yards with 20 touchdowns but showed a stark decline in accuracy and mobility, just one season after signing a four-year, $212.4 million extension in July 2024. He finished second in the NFL with 15 interceptions, which was a career high.\n\nTagovailoa is guaranteed $54 million for 2026, and the Dolphins would incur significant hits to the salary cap by releasing him. Releasing him next year would result in a $99 million dead cap charge. If the move is designated as a post-June 1 release, those charges are split over two years, with $67.4 million allocated to the 2026 cap and $31.8 million in 2027.\n\nRookie seventh-round pick Quinn Ewers went 1-2 as Miami's starter but didn't separate himself as the clear No. 1 option for 2026, throwing for 569 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions. And the Dolphins recently signed rookie sixth-round pick Cam Miller off the Raiders' practice squad to join the competition.\n\nDespite a second consecutive losing season that ensured the Dolphins' 25-year playoff win drought will remain intact, McDaniel apparently has the backing of Ross. And the two will meet again later this week to discuss the organization's future.\n\n“We both share the same sentiment that we’re not where we want to be,” McDaniel said. \"We’re not just dismissing this season as, ‘Oops, we’ll try again.’”\n\nThe Dolphins will also need to figure out what to do with the contract of star receiver Tyreek Hill, who'll be 32 in March and suffered a severe knee injury in September.\n\nThe Dolphins acquired Hill in a trade with Kansas City in 2022 and gave him a $120 million, four-year contract extension, which he restructured in 2024 and runs through 2026.\n\nHill is owed about $29.9 million next season, though $11 million of that becomes guaranteed after the start of the new league year, which is also when the Dolphins will have to pay him a $5 million roster bonus.\n\nHill would carry a $51.9 million cap hit if the Dolphins release him.\n\nMcDaniel doesn't believe the organization is heading toward a complete rebuild. Regardless, the new GM will have several core pieces to build around, including third-year running back De'Von Achane, second-year left tackle Patrick Paul, veteran center Aaron Brewer and veteran linebacker Jordyn Brooks.\n\nAchane had one of the best seasons of any Dolphins running back, and Brooks, who said Monday he hopes to remain in Miami the rest of his career, led the NFL with 183 tackles.\n\nA couple players set to hit free agency have expressed interest in returning to to the Dolphins, including veteran tight end Darren Waller.\n\nWaller came out of retirement to play in Miami on a one-year deal last July but was limited to nine games because of injuries. Still, Waller caught 24 of 34 targets for six touchdowns. The 33-year-old said he's undecided on whether he will return to football next season, but said he will make a decision soon and is considering returning to Miami.\n\nOnce the new GM is in place, the Dolphins will likely need to get an earlier start on free agency than they did last season. They also have the 11th pick in the NFL draft.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "Monday’s NBA and NHL slates present plenty of betting opportunities as teams hit midseason form and trends across both leagues turn into dependable indicators. As January rolls on, separation on the hardwood and ice sharpens betting lines, creating clearer opportunities at the window.  Here are tonight’s best bets brought to you by BetOnline.ag. All new players get a 50% welcome bonus and up to $250 in free bets.\n\nRundown: The Los Angeles Kings (17-14-9) wrap up a two-game home set against the Minnesota Wild (25-10-8) on Monday night at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nLos Angeles enters tonight’s contest riding the momentum of a 5-4 shootout win over Minnesota on Saturday, a result that stood out given the Kings’ season-long offensive struggles. Ranked 31st in goals per game, Los Angeles capitalized on its chances against a Wild team that had won eight of its previous 10 contests, with Adrian Kempe recording a two-point night to spark the breakthrough performance. While the final score reflected a wide-open game, much of the damage came from situational lapses rather than sustained offensive pressure.\n\nDespite Saturday’s nine-goal outburst, both teams continue to lean on structure and goal prevention as their foundation. The Kings rank third in the NHL in goals allowed per game (2.65), relying on disciplined defensive-zone coverage and limiting high-danger chances, a style that has pushed 22 of their 40 games (55%) below the posted total. Minnesota enters with a similar identity, excelling at controlling tempo and suppressing second-chance opportunities.\n\nExpect a sharper, more methodical approach in the rematch, with both teams tightening neutral-zone play and limiting rush chances. With goaltending and defensive structure likely to dictate the pace, this matchup sets up for a lower-scoring outcome this time around.\n\nRundown: The Los Angeles Clippers (12-22) close out a five-game homestand on Monday night as they host the Golden State Warriors (19-17) at Intuit Dome.\n\nLos Angeles looks to rebound after a 31-point blowout loss to Boston that snapped its six-game winning streak and dropped the Clippers back to 10 games under the .500 mark. Jaylen Brown’s 50-point outburst exposed some of Los Angeles’ season-long offensive issues, as the Clippers continue to rank near the bottom of the league in scoring efficiency. Despite the uneven record, Los Angeles’ recent surge has translated to the betting market, covering seven of its last 10 games and posting an 8–8 record against the spread when listed as underdogs of 2.5 points or more. Kawhi Leonard and James Harden will be tasked with generating efficient looks against a Golden State defense that ranks seventh in the NBA in points allowed (113.9 per game) and does a strong job limiting perimeter scoring.\n\nOn the other side, Golden State enters playing its best basketball in weeks, winning six of its last eight contests behind the continued brilliance of Stephen Curry. At 37 years old, Curry remains the engine of the Warriors’ offense, averaging 28.8 points per game, ninth-highest in the league. While Golden State’s recent success has boosted its position in the standings, it has not consistently carried over to the betting window, as the Warriors have covered just three of their last 10 games and sit 15-21 ATS on the season. As favorites of 2.5 points or more, Golden State has struggled to separate, owning a 9-14-1 ATS record in those spots.\n\nExpect Los Angeles to lean on home-court energy and create opportunities in key spots, keeping this matchup within a single possession as the final buzzer sounds.",

    "description": "NVIDIA today kickstarted the next generation of AI with the launch of the NVIDIA Rubin platform, comprising six new chips designed to deliver one incredible AI supercomputer.",
    "fullText": "CES—NVIDIA today kickstarted the next generation of AI with the launch of the NVIDIA Rubin platform, comprising six new chips designed to deliver one incredible AI supercomputer. NVIDIA Rubin sets a new standard for building, deploying and securing the world’s largest and most advanced AI systems at the lowest cost to accelerate mainstream AI adoption.\n\nThe Rubin platform uses extreme codesign across the six chips — the NVIDIA Vera CPU, NVIDIA Rubin GPU, NVIDIA NVLink™ 6 Switch, NVIDIA ConnectX®-9 SuperNIC, NVIDIA BlueField®-4 DPU and NVIDIA Spectrum™-6 Ethernet Switch — to slash training time and inference token costs.\n\n“Rubin arrives at exactly the right moment, as AI computing demand for both training and inference is going through the roof,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With our annual cadence of delivering a new generation of AI supercomputers — and extreme codesign across six new chips — Rubin takes a giant leap toward the next frontier of AI.”\n\nNamed for Vera Florence Cooper Rubin — the trailblazing American astronomer whose discoveries transformed humanity’s understanding of the universe — the Rubin platform features the NVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL72 rack-scale solution and the NVIDIA HGX Rubin NVL8 system.\n\nThe Rubin platform introduces five innovations, including the latest generations of NVIDIA NVLink interconnect technology, Transformer Engine, Confidential Computing and RAS Engine, as well as the NVIDIA Vera CPU. These breakthroughs will accelerate agentic AI, advanced reasoning and massive-scale mixture-of-experts (MoE) model inference at up to 10x lower cost per token of the NVIDIA Blackwell platform. Compared with its predecessor, the NVIDIA Rubin platform trains MoE models with 4x fewer GPUs to accelerate AI adoption.\n\nBroad Ecosystem Support\n\nAmong the world’s leading AI labs, cloud service providers, computer makers and startups expected to adopt Rubin are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Anthropic, Black Forest Labs, Cisco, Cohere, CoreWeave, Cursor, Dell Technologies, Google, Harvey, HPE, Lambda, Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, Nebius, Nscale, OpenAI, OpenEvidence, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), Perplexity, Runway, Supermicro, Thinking Machines Lab and xAI.\n\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI: “Intelligence scales with compute. When we add more compute, models get more capable, solve harder problems and make a bigger impact for people. The NVIDIA Rubin platform helps us keep scaling this progress so advanced intelligence benefits everyone.”\n\nDario Amodei, cofounder and CEO of Anthropic: “The efficiency gains in the NVIDIA Rubin platform represent the kind of infrastructure progress that enables longer memory, better reasoning and more reliable outputs. Our collaboration with NVIDIA helps power our safety research and our frontier models.”\n\nMark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Meta: “NVIDIA’s Rubin platform promises to deliver the step-change in performance and efficiency required to deploy the most advanced models to billions of people.”\n\nElon Musk, founder and CEO of xAI: “💚🎉🚀 🤖NVIDIA Rubin will be a rocket engine for AI. If you want to train and deploy frontier models at scale, this is the infrastructure you use — and Rubin will remind the world that NVIDIA is the gold standard.💚🎉🚀 🤖”\n\nSatya Nadella, executive chairman and CEO of Microsoft: “We are building the world’s most powerful AI superfactories to serve any workload, anywhere, with maximum performance and efficiency. With the addition of NVIDIA Vera Rubin GPUs, we will empower developers and organizations to create, reason and scale in entirely new ways.”\n\nMike Intrator, cofounder and CEO of CoreWeave: “We built CoreWeave to help pioneers accelerate their innovations with the unmatched performance of our purpose-built AI platform, matching the right technology to the right workloads as they evolve. The NVIDIA Rubin platform represents an important advancement for reasoning, agentic and large-scale inference workloads, and we’re excited to add it to our platform. With CoreWeave Mission Control as the operating standard, we can integrate new capabilities quickly and run them reliably at production scale, working in close partnership with NVIDIA.”\n\nMatt Garman, CEO of AWS: “AWS and NVIDIA have been driving cloud AI innovation together for more than 15 years. The NVIDIA Rubin platform on AWS represents our continued commitment to delivering cutting-edge AI infrastructure that gives customers unmatched choice and flexibility. By combining NVIDIA’s advanced AI technology with AWS’s proven scale, security and comprehensive AI services, customers can build, train and deploy their most demanding AI applications faster and more cost effectively — accelerating their path from experimentation to production at any scale.”\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet: “We are proud of our deep and long-standing relationship with NVIDIA. To meet the substantial customer demand we see for NVIDIA GPUs, we are focused on providing the best possible environment for their hardware on Google Cloud. Our collaboration will continue as we bring the impressive capabilities of the Rubin platform to our customers, offering them the scale and performance needed to advance the boundaries of AI.”\n\nClay Magouyrk, CEO of Oracle: “Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is a hyperscale cloud built for the highest performance, and together with NVIDIA, we’re pushing the boundaries of what customers can build and scale with AI. With gigascale AI factories powered by the NVIDIA Vera Rubin architecture, OCI is giving customers the infrastructure foundation they need to push the limits of model training, inference and real-world AI impact.”\n\nMichael Dell, chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies: “The NVIDIA Rubin platform represents a major leap forward in AI infrastructure. By integrating Rubin into the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA, we’re building infrastructure that can handle massive token volumes and multistep reasoning while delivering the performance and resiliency that enterprises and neoclouds need to deploy AI at scale.”\n\nAntonio Neri, president and CEO of HPE: “AI is reshaping not just workloads but the very foundations of IT, requiring us to reimagine every layer of infrastructure from the network to the compute. With the NVIDIA Vera Rubin platform, HPE is building the next generation of secure, AI-native infrastructure, turning data into intelligence and enabling enterprises to become true AI factories.”\n\nYuanqing Yang, chairman and CEO of Lenovo: “Lenovo is embracing the next-generation NVIDIA Rubin platform, leveraging our Neptune liquid-cooling solution as well as our global scale, manufacturing efficiency and service reach, to help enterprises build AI factories that serve as intelligent, accelerated engines for insight and innovation. Together, we’re architecting an AI-driven future where efficient, secure AI becomes the standard for every organization.”\n\nEngineered to Scale Intelligence\n\nAgentic AI and reasoning models, along with state-of-the-art video generation workloads, are redefining the limits of computation. Multistep problem-solving requires models to process, reason and act across long sequences of tokens. Designed to serve the demands of complex AI workloads, the Rubin platform’s five groundbreaking technologies include:\n\nAI-Native Storage and Secure, Software-Defined Infrastructure\n\nNVIDIA Rubin introduces NVIDIA Inference Context Memory Storage Platform, a new class of AI-native storage infrastructure designed to scale inference context at gigascale.\n\nAs AI factories increasingly adopt bare-metal and multi-tenant deployment models, maintaining strong infrastructure control and isolation becomes essential.\n\nBlueField-4 also introduces Advanced Secure Trusted Resource Architecture, or ASTRA, a system-level trust architecture that gives AI infrastructure builders a single, trusted control point to securely provision, isolate and operate large-scale AI environments without compromising performance.\n\nWith AI applications evolving toward multi-turn agentic reasoning, AI-native organizations must manage and share far larger volumes of inference context across users, sessions and services.\n\nDifferent Forms for Different Workloads\n\nNVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL72 offers a unified, secure system that combines 72 NVIDIA Rubin GPUs, 36 NVIDIA Vera CPUs, NVIDIA NVLink 6, NVIDIA ConnectX-9 SuperNICs and NVIDIA BlueField-4 DPUs.\n\nNVIDIA will also offer the NVIDIA HGX Rubin NVL8 platform, a server board that links eight Rubin GPUs through NVLink to support x86-based generative AI platforms. The HGX Rubin NVL8 platform accelerates training, inference and scientific computing for AI and high-performance computing workloads.\n\nNVIDIA DGX SuperPOD™ serves as a reference for deploying Rubin-based systems at scale, integrating either NVIDIA DGX Vera Rubin NVL72 or DGX Rubin NVL8 systems with NVIDIA BlueField-4 DPUs, NVIDIA ConnectX-9 SuperNICs, NVIDIA InfiniBand networking and NVIDIA Mission Control™ software.\n\nNext-Generation Ethernet Networking\n\nAdvanced Ethernet networking and storage are components of AI infrastructure critical to keeping data centers running at full speed, improving performance and efficiency, and lowering costs.\n\nNVIDIA Spectrum-6 Ethernet is the next generation of Ethernet for AI networking, built to scale Rubin-based AI factories with higher efficiency and greater resilience, and enabled by 200G SerDes communication circuitry, co-packaged optics and AI-optimized fabrics.\n\nBuilt on the Spectrum-6 architecture, Spectrum-X Ethernet Photonics co-packaged optical switch systems deliver 10x greater reliability and 5x longer uptime for AI applications while achieving 5x better power efficiency, maximizing performance per watt compared with traditional methods. Spectrum-XGS Ethernet technology, part of the Spectrum-X Ethernet platform, enables facilities separated by hundreds of kilometers and more to function as a single AI environment.\n\nTogether, these innovations define the next generation of the NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet platform, engineered with extreme codesign for Rubin to enable massive-scale AI factories and pave the way for future million-GPU environments.\n\nRubin Readiness\n\nNVIDIA Rubin is in full production, and Rubin-based products will be available from partners the second half of 2026.\n\nAmong the first cloud providers to deploy Vera Rubin-based instances in 2026 will be AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft and OCI, as well as NVIDIA Cloud Partners CoreWeave, Lambda, Nebius and Nscale.\n\nMicrosoft will deploy NVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL72 rack-scale systems as part of next-generation AI data centers, including future Fairwater AI superfactory sites.\n\nDesigned to deliver unprecedented efficiency and performance for training and inference workloads, the Rubin platform will provide the foundation for Microsoft’s next-generation cloud AI capabilities. Microsoft Azure will offer a tightly optimized platform enabling customers to accelerate innovation across enterprise, research and consumer applications.\n\nCoreWeave will integrate NVIDIA Rubin-based systems into its AI cloud platform beginning in the second half of 2026. CoreWeave is built to operate multiple architectures side by side, enabling customers to bring Rubin into their environments, where it will deliver the greatest impact across training, inference and agentic workloads.\n\nTogether with NVIDIA, CoreWeave will help AI pioneers take advantage of Rubin’s advancements in reasoning and MoE models, while continuing to deliver the performance, operational reliability and scale required for production AI across the full lifecycle with CoreWeave Mission Control.\n\nIn addition, Cisco, Dell, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro are expected to deliver a wide range of servers based on Rubin products.\n\nAI labs including Anthropic, Black Forest, Cohere, Cursor, Harvey, Meta, Mistral AI, OpenAI, OpenEvidence, Perplexity, Runway, Thinking Machines Lab and xAI are looking to the NVIDIA Rubin platform to train larger, more capable models and to serve long-context, multimodal systems at lower latency and cost than with prior GPU generations.\n\nInfrastructure software and storage partners AIC, Canonical, Cloudian, DDN, Dell, HPE, Hitachi Vantara, IBM, NetApp, Nutanix, Pure Storage, Supermicro, SUSE, VAST Data and WEKA are working with NVIDIA to design next-generation platforms for Rubin infrastructure.\n\nThe Rubin platform marks NVIDIA’s third-generation rack-scale architecture, with more than 80 NVIDIA MGX™ ecosystem partners.\n\nTo unlock this density, Red Hat today announced an expanded collaboration with NVIDIA to deliver a complete AI stack optimized for the NVIDIA Rubin platform with Red Hat’s hybrid cloud portfolio, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat AI. These solutions are used by the vast majority of Fortune Global 500 companies.\n\nLearn more by watching NVIDIA Live at CES and reading the “Inside Vera Rubin” technical blog.",

    "description": "Many are celebrating the ouster of a brutal dictator, but the Maduro regime may survive the loss of Maduro.",
    "fullText": "On my last visit to Venezuela in 2019, I saw children starving because of the kleptocracy overseen by President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nIn the impoverished, violent slum of La Dolorita in Caracas, I met an emaciated 5-year-old girl, Alaska. Her mother told me that Alaska, weighing just 26 pounds and near death from malnutrition, had been turned away from four hospitals because no beds were available.\n\nAnother mother wept as she said that her 8-month-old baby girl, Daisha, died after three hospitals had turned the girl away.\n\nMany Americans don’t understand how brutal and incompetent Maduro’s dictatorship was, and how much suffering the population endured. Government thugs tortured, raped and killed with impunity, and ordinary citizens lost their children to tragic misrule — even as regime officials lived lavishly and ostentatiously (such as overindulging in expensive whiskeys at the hotel where I last stayed).\n\nVenezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world, and back in 2000 it had a lower child mortality rate than Peru, Brazil and Colombia; now, the rate is higher in Venezuela than in any of those countries, which means thousands of children die unnecessarily each year. It’s true that U.S. sanctions compounded the suffering (and I argued against such general sanctions), but the central reason was the venality and ineptitude of the regime. So of course many Venezuelans are celebrating when they see Maduro fall.\n\n“We are free,” a Venezuelan woman in Chile told Reuters after Maduro’s removal on Saturday. “We are all happy that the dictatorship has fallen and that we have a free country.”\n\nI understand the giddiness, but I worry the triumphalism may be overdone.\n\nTrue, Maduro was a disaster for Venezuela and for the entire region, with nearly eight million refugees fleeing the country. Yes, he appears to have stolen the 2024 election.\n\nBut President Trump’s operation to remove Maduro appears to be illegal, and it’s not at all clear that the regime itself will be toppled or that life will improve for ordinary Venezuelans.\n\nBarging into countries to arrest a foe, reportedly killing at least 80 people in the process, is not a precedent we want others to follow. I’m in Taiwan as I write this, and some are wondering if President Xi Jinping of China will get ideas. Frankly, I doubt that: I believe that what constrains Xi is military calculus, not concern for the rule of law. But it’s still true that the world works better when the United States promotes the “rules-based international order” rather than the law of the jungle that Thucydides recounted 2,500 years ago: “The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.”\n\nTrump could have tried to provide a legal justification for the incursion by saying that he had the permission of Venezuela’s rightful president, Edmundo González, the apparent winner of the 2024 election. The United States even under President Joe Biden recognized González as Venezuela’s true president-elect, so that might have been a useful fig leaf for lawyers to work with. But Trump has been dismissive of the democratic forces represented by González and María Corina Machado, the opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner.\n\nInstead, Trump asserted in a news conference on Saturday, “We are going to run the country.” He seemed less interested in Venezuelan democracy and human rights than in gaining American control over Venezuelan oil. “We’re going to have presence in Venezuela as it pertains to oil,” he declared.\n\nAll that should sound an alarm. The military and intelligence side of the Venezuela operation was masterful, but the legal and political sides seem frightful, and that bodes poorly for the country’s future.\n\nMaduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, remains in place, and is acting as president. Trump aides seem to think they can control Venezuela through her, but for now, Rodriguez does not seem eager to be their poodle.\n\n“If there is something the Venezuelan people will never be again, it is slaves,” she said. She referred to the attack on her country as “barbaric” and an “illegal kidnapping.”\n\nIt’s true that Rodríguez has been more pragmatic in her career and more attuned to the public’s well-being than Maduro was (a low bar), but in any case, it’s not clear how much autonomy she has to make decisions. Venezuela is run by a clutch of top security officials backed by Cuban gunmen, and it’s not obvious why they would choose to surrender power.\n\nIf Rodríguez resists, what then? Trump suggested that there might be a “second wave” of attacks. “We’re not afraid of boots on the ground,” he said, but he should be. For America to dispatch an invading force to occupy Venezuela, an area roughly twice the size of California, would take an enormous force; Afghanistan and Iraq should have taught us a bit of prudence.\n\nChina was bitterly critical of Trump’s attack on Venezuela, but I wonder if China might prove a beneficiary of it. Careless invasions reinforce narratives of Yankee arrogance and undermine American soft power. And while Trump aides intellectually understand the need to redirect attention and resources to Asia, Venezuela may end up being a long-term distraction that would impede that pivot.\n\nMaybe I’m being too bleak; it’s possible that this will all work out. Perhaps economic pressure and the threat of further military force will lead the Venezuelan regime to hand power to Machado and those around her. If Venezuela were properly led, it could thrive and become an engine for the region, and the loss of Venezuelan support might bring down the Cuban dictatorship as well.\n\nYet it’s quite possible that the Maduro regime will stagger on without Maduro, leaving the population increasingly impoverished. Or Venezuela could descend into chaos or civil war that empowers paramilitary “colectivos” or guerrillas in the leftist ELN organization.\n\nA central lesson of post-World War II military interventions is to beware of leaders glibly celebrating their missions accomplished. Toppling a government is invariably easier than ensuring a better one.\n\nAs I was listening to Trump triumphantly announce his plans to run the country and control Venezuelan oil, I thought of a time I was caught up in street fighting in Caracas in 2002. I was interviewing people in a huge crowd of left-wing Chavistas who were facing off against another large crowd down the street, apparently right-wing anti-Chavistas. Gunshots were fired, bottles rained down, and the army fired tear gas to try to dispel the crowds.\n\nI slipped over to interview people on the other side — and discovered that they were Chavistas as well.

    "description": "UN body’s recommendations driven by AI advances and proliferation of consumer-oriented neurotech devices",
    "fullText": "UN body’s recommendations driven by AI advances and proliferation of consumer-oriented neurotech devices\n\nIt is the latest move in a growing international effort to put guardrails around a burgeoning frontier – technologies that harness data from the brain and nervous system.\n\nUnesco has adopted a set of global standards on the ethics of neurotechnology, a field that has been described as “a bit of a wild west”.\n\n“There is no control,” said Unesco’s chief of bioethics, Dafna Feinholz. “We have to inform the people about the risks, the potential benefits, the alternatives, so that people have the possibility to say ‘I accept, or I don’t accept’.”\n\nShe said the new standards were driven by two recent developments in neurotechnology: artificial intelligence (AI), which offers vast possibilities in decoding brain data, and the proliferation of consumer-grade neurotech devices such as earbuds that claim to read brain activity and glasses that track eye movements.\n\nThe standards define a new category of data, “neural data”, and suggest guidelines governing its protection. A list of more than 100 recommendations ranges from rights-based concerns to addressing scenarios that are – at least for now – science fiction, such as companies using neurotechnology to subliminally market to people during their dreams.\n\n“Neurotechnology has the potential to define the next frontier of human progress, but it is not without risks,” said Unesco’s director general, Audrey Azoulay. The new standards would “enshrine the inviolability of the human mind”, she said.\n\nBillions of dollars have poured into neurotech ventures in the past few years, from Sam Altman’s August investment in Merge Labs, a competitor to Elon Musk’s Neuralink, to Meta’s recent unveiling of a wristband that allows users to control their phone or AI Ray-Bans by reading muscle movements in their wrist.\n\nThe wave of investment has brought with it a growing push for regulation. The World Economic Forum released a paper last month calling for a privacy oriented framework, and the US senator Chuck Schumer introduced the Mind Act in September – following the lead of four states that have introduced laws to protect “neural data” since 2024.\n\nAdvocates for neurotech regulation emphasise the importance of safeguarding personal data. Unesco’s standards highlight the need for “mental privacy” and “freedom of thought”.\n\nSceptics, however, say legislative efforts are often driven by dystopian anxieties and risk hampering vital medical advances.\n\n“What’s happening with all this legislation is fear. People are afraid of what this technology is capable of. The idea of neurotech reading people’s minds is scary,” said Kristen Mathews, a lawyer who works on mental privacy issues at the US law firm Cooley.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, neurotechnology has been around for more than 100 years. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was invented in 1924, and the first brain-computer interfaces were developed in the 1970s. The latest wave of investment, however, is driven by advances in AI that make it possible to decode large amounts of data – including, possibly, brainwaves.\n\n“The thing that has enabled this technology to present perceived privacy issues is the introduction of AI,” said Mathews.\n\nSome AI-enabled neurotech advances could be medically transformative, helping treat conditions from Parkinson’s disease to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\nA paper published in Nature this summer described an AI-powered brain-computer interface decoding the speech of a paralysis patient. Other work suggests AI may one day be able to “read” your thoughts – or at least, reconstruct an image if you concentrate on it hard.\n\nThe hype around some of these advances has generated fears that Mathews said were often far removed from the real dangers. The Mind Act, for example, says AI and the “vertical corporate integration” of neurotechnology could lead to “cognitive manipulation” and “erosion of personal autonomy”.\n\n“I’m not aware of any company that’s doing any of this stuff. It’s not going to happen. Maybe two decades from now,” she said.\n\nThe current frontier of neurotechnology lies in improving brain-computer interfaces, which despite recent breakthroughs are in their infancy – and in the proliferation of consumer-oriented devices, which Mathews said could raise privacy concerns, a bugbear of the Unesco standards. She argues, however, that creating the concept of “neural data” is too broad an approach to this issue.\n\n“That’s the type of thing that we would want to address. Monetising, behavioural advertising, using neural data. But the laws that are out there, they’re not getting at the stuff we’re worried about. They’re more amorphous.”",

    "description": "The U.S. took the unprecedented step Monday of dropping the number of vaccines it recommends for every child —  leaving other immunizations, such as flu shots, open to families to choose but without clear guidance.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. took the unprecedented step Monday of cutting the number of vaccines it recommends for every child — a move that leading medical groups said would undermine protections against a half-dozen diseases.\n\nThe change is effective immediately, meaning that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now recommend that all children get vaccinated against 11 diseases. What’s no longer broadly recommended is protection against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, some forms of meningitis or RSV. Instead, protections against those diseases are only recommended for certain groups deemed high risk, or when doctors recommend them in what’s called “shared decision-making.”\n\nTrump administration officials said the overhaul, a move long sought by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., won’t result in families who want the vaccines losing access to them, and said insurance will continue to pay. But medical experts said the decision creates confusion for parents and could increase preventable diseases.\n\nStates, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While CDC requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the Trump administration’s guidance on vaccines.\n\nThe change comes as U.S. vaccination rates have been slipping and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising across the country.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the overhaul was in response to a request from President Donald Trump in December. Trump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.\n\nHHS said its comparison to 20 peer nations found that the U.S. was an “outlier” in both the number of vaccinations and the number of doses it recommended to all children. Officials with the agency framed the change as a way to increase public trust by recommending only the most important vaccinations for children to receive.\n\nAP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on the U.S. lowering the number of recommended childhood vaccines.\n\n“This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,” Kennedy said in a statement Monday.\n\nTrump, reacting to the news on his Truth Social platform, said the new schedule is “far more reasonable” and “finally aligns the United States with other Developed Nations around the World.”\n\nAmong those left on the recommended-for-everyone list are vaccines against measles, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, chickenpox and human papillomavirus, or HPV. The guidance reduces the number of recommended vaccine doses against HPV from two or three shots depending on age to one for most children.\n\nMedical experts said Monday’s changes without what they said was public discussion or a transparent review of the data would put children at risk.\n\n“Abandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,” said Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota.\n\nDr. Sean O’Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics said countries carefully consider vaccine recommendations based on levels of disease in their populations and their health systems.\n\n“You can’t just copy and paste public health and that’s what they seem to be doing here,” said O’Leary. “Literally children’s health and children’s lives are at stake.”\n\nMost high-income countries recommend vaccinations against a dozen to 15 serious pathogens, according to a recent review by the Vaccine Integrity Project, a group that works to safeguard vaccine use.\n\nFrance today recommends all children get vaccinated against 14 diseases, compared to the 11 that the U.S. now will recommend for every child under the new schedule.\n\nThe changes were made by political appointees, without any evidence that the current recommendations were harming children, O’Leary said.\n\nThe pediatricians’ group has issued its own childhood vaccine schedule that its members are following, and it continues to broadly recommend vaccines that the Trump administration demoted.\n\nO’Leary singled out the flu vaccine, which the government and leading medical experts have long urged for nearly everyone starting at age 6 months. He said the government is “pretty tone deaf” for ending its recommendation while the country is at the beginning of a severe flu season, and after 280 children died from flu last winter, the most since 2009.\n\nEven a disease that parents may not have heard of, rotavirus, could come roaring back if vaccination erodes, he added. That diarrheal disease once hospitalized thousands of children each winter, something that no longer happens.\n\nThe decision was made without input from an advisory committee that typically consults on the vaccine schedule, said senior officials at HHS. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the changes publicly.\n\nThe officials added that the new recommendations were a collaborative effort between federal health agencies but wouldn’t specify who was consulted.\n\nScientists at the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases were asked to present to the agency’s political leadership about vaccine schedules in other countries in December, but they were not allowed to give any recommendations and were not aware of any decisions about vaccine schedule changes, said Abby Tighe, executive director of the National Public Health Coalition, an advocacy organization of current and former CDC employees and their supporters.\n\n“Changes of this magnitude require careful review, expert and public input, and clear scientific justification. That level of rigor and transparency was not part of this decision,” said Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, of the American Medical Association. “The scientific evidence remains unchanged, and the AMA supports continued access to childhood immunizations recommended by national medical specialty societies.”\n\nThe move comes as Kennedy, a longtime activist against vaccines, has repeatedly used his authority in government to translate his skepticism about the shots into national guidance.\n\nIn May, Kennedy announced the CDC would no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women — a move immediately questioned by public health experts who saw no new data to justify the change.\n\nIn June, Kennedy fired an entire 17-member CDC vaccine advisory committee — later installing several of his own replacements, including multiple vaccine skeptics.\n\nKennedy in November also personally directed the CDC to abandon its position that vaccines do not cause autism, without supplying any new evidence to support the change.\n\nSwenson reported from New York.

    "description": "At the CES conference, Jensen Huang, the company’s chief executive, said the more efficient and powerful chip would begin shipping later this year.",
    "fullText": "Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip-making giant Nvidia, put his company at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom by making semiconductors more powerful than any of his rivals’. This year, he’s promising to do it again.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Huang said the company would begin shipping a new A.I. chip later this year, one that can do more computing with less power than previous generations of chips could. Known as the Vera Rubin, the chip has been in development for three years and is designed to fulfill A.I. requests more quickly and cheaply than its predecessors.\n\nMr. Huang, who spoke during CES, an annual tech conference in Las Vegas, also discussed Nvidia’s surprisingly ambitious work around autonomous vehicles. This year, Mercedes-Benz will begin shipping cars equipped with Nvidia self-driving technology comparable to Tesla’s Autopilot.\n\nNvidia’s new Rubin chips are being manufactured and will be shipped to customers, including Microsoft and Amazon, in the second half of the year, fulfilling a promise Mr. Huang made last March when he first described the chip at the company’s annual conference in San Jose, Calif.\n\nCompanies will be able to train A.I. models with one-quarter as many Rubin chips as its predecessor, the Blackwell. It can provide information for chatbots and other A.I. products for one-tenth of the cost. They will also be able to install the chips in data centers more quickly, courtesy of redesigned supercomputers that feature fewer cables.\n\nIf the new chips live up to their promise, they could allow companies to develop A.I. at a lower cost and at least begin to respond to the soaring electrical demands of data centers being built around the world.\n\n“This is how we’re going to get everybody to the next frontier and push A.I. to the next level and, of course, to build these data centers energy efficiently and cost efficiently as well,” Mr. Huang said.\n\nThe Rubin chips are named for the astronomer Vera Rubin, who did groundbreaking research on dark matter. The new chips are key to maintaining Nvidia’s dominance of the A.I. industry and its perch as the world’s most valuable company. Nvidia’s A.I. chips, which account for more than 90 percent of the market, are highly coveted by businesses and governments around the world. It sells them for about $30,000 each, with nearly three-quarters of that being pure profit.\n\nBut the company is facing increased competition from chip makers and even some customers who are eager to seize a slice of the lucrative A.I. industry. Last year, Advanced Micro Devices, known as AMD, and Google, which buys Nvidia chips but also makes its own chips, struck deals to provide their technology to OpenAI, one of the world’s largest users of A.I. chips.\n\nThe rising threat contributed to Nvidia’s deal last month to license technology from the chip start-up Groq. The agreement is expected to help Nvidia develop chips that allow A.I. to more efficiently fulfill requests through a process known as inference.\n\nBecause more people are using A.I., chip makers are trying to make delivering it less expensive and less power hungry, said Daniel Newman, the chief executive of Futurum Group, a tech research firm. “That’s the name of the game because utilization is very early,” he said.\n\nThe competitive challenges have buffeted Nvidia alongside a series of geopolitical headaches. Mr. Huang spent much of last year lobbying President Trump to allow Nvidia to sell its A.I. chips to China. At the same time, he was trying to fend off efforts by Beijing to discourage Chinese companies from buying Nvidia’s chips because of security concerns.\n\nIn December, Mr. Trump granted the company permission to sell its second-most-powerful chip to China. But Beijing has not decided whether it will allow its companies to buy Nvidia products.\n\nDemand for Nvidia’s chips has turned Mr. Huang, 62, into a globe-trotting salesman and diplomat. He traveled with Mr. Trump to the Middle East and Britain, where he played a key role in technology deals between nations.\n\nNvidia’s business has flourished during the A.I. boom of the past three years. In November, the company reported a quarterly profit of $31.9 billion, a 65 percent increase from a year earlier and 245 percent from the year before that. It expects about $500 billion in sales through the end of this year.\n\nStill, Mr. Huang has been eager to diversify Nvidia’s business and expand its roster of customers. He has been pushing the company to become a major player in robotics and autonomous vehicles.\n\nOn Monday, he said Nvidia had developed new A.I. software that would allow customers like Uber and Lucid to develop cars that navigate roads autonomously. It will share the system, called Alpamayo, to spread its influence and the appeal of Nvidia’s chip technology.\n\nSince 2020, Nvidia has been working with Mercedes to develop a class of self-driving cars. They will begin shipping an early example of their collaboration when Mercedes CLA cars become available in the first half of the year in Europe and the United States.\n\nMr. Huang said the company started working on self-driving technology eight years ago. It has more than a thousand people working on the project.\n\n“Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,” Mr. Huang said.",

    "description": "How Google engineer Jaana Dogan discovered an AI tool that recreated a year-long engineering effort in one hour—what it means for developers and AI’s future.",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence rarely shocks senior engineers anymore. Most professionals in big tech expect rapid progress. Yet, in early 2026, a candid revelation by Jaana Dogan, a principal engineer at Google, managed to do exactly that. Her experience with an AI coding tool ignited a global conversation about software development, productivity, and the real role of human engineers in an AI-assisted future.\n\nThis was not marketing hype. It came from someone deeply involved in building large-scale AI systems. That authenticity is why her story resonated across the tech world.\n\nJaana Dogan is a Principal Engineer at Google, associated with work on advanced AI systems, including Google’s Gemini ecosystem. Engineers at this level typically focus on system architecture, long-term design decisions, and complex coordination between multiple components rather than routine coding.\n\nShe is not a celebrity technologist or influencer. Instead, she represents a growing group of highly experienced engineers who speak openly about how AI tools are reshaping their daily work. That credibility matters, especially when discussing sensitive topics like productivity gains and automation.\n\nThe moment that brought Jaana Dogan into the spotlight involved a hands-on experiment with Claude Code, an AI coding tool developed by Anthropic. Out of curiosity, she tested whether the tool could understand and recreate a complex system her team had already built at Google.\n\nAccording to Dogan, after providing a clear description of the problem, the AI generated a functional version of a distributed agent orchestrator in roughly one hour. Her team had spent close to a year designing and building a similar system internally.\n\nThis account was first reported by The Indian Express, which quoted Dogan’s own public remarks and reactions from the wider tech community.\n\nTo understand why this mattered, some context helps.\n\nA distributed agent orchestrator is not a simple script. It coordinates multiple autonomous agents, manages communication between them, and ensures tasks execute in the correct order. These systems often involve:\n\nIn large organizations like Google, building such systems involves months of design reviews, testing, and refinements. That’s why the speed of the AI-generated result raised eyebrows.\n\nThe AI output was not production-ready software. Dogan herself made that clear. The generated code still required validation, security reviews, performance testing, and human judgment. However, the structure and logic closely resembled what her team had arrived at after extensive discussions.\n\nThink of it like this: the AI produced a strong architectural draft, not a finished skyscraper.\n\nThis distinction is crucial for maintaining factual accuracy and avoiding exaggerated claims.\n\nThis was not a startup demo or marketing blog post. The observation came from a senior Google engineer with direct experience in large-scale AI systems.\n\nDogan openly acknowledged limitations instead of claiming AI superiority. That balance increased trust in her assessment.\n\nIf AI tools can reduce early-stage development time from months to hours, workflows will change. That affects cost planning, timelines, and team structures.\n\nCoverage from The Economic Times and Times of India further highlighted how divisive this moment was for software engineers globally.\nSources:\n– Economic Times (Technology Updates)\n– Times of India (Tech News)\n\nLong answer: The role is evolving.\n\nAI tools excel at pattern recognition and rapid synthesis. They struggle with context, accountability, and responsibility. Human engineers still:\n\nDecide whether an approach fits real-world constraints\n\nHandle edge cases that AI cannot predict\n\nEnsure compliance with legal and ethical standards\n\nMaintain systems over long timeframes\n\nDogan herself encouraged developers to test AI tools in domains they understand deeply. That advice reflects confidence, not fear.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of this story is Dogan’s openness about a competitor’s product. Historically, engineers at major tech firms avoid praising rival tools publicly.\n\nHer response suggests a cultural shift. Many professionals now view AI advancement as a shared ecosystem rather than a zero-sum competition. Progress by one company often pushes the entire field forward.\n\nThat mindset aligns with broader industry trends toward open research, shared benchmarks, and collaborative safety discussions.\n\nTeams can explore ideas quickly without committing months up front.\n\nEngineers may spend less time on boilerplate code and more time on design, review, and decision-making.\n\nPrompt design, system evaluation, and AI oversight will become core technical skills.\n\nThese conclusions align with discussions already happening in academic research and enterprise software planning.\n\nThis story gained traction not because it was sensational, but because it felt honest. It showed excitement, concern, and realism at the same time.\n\nDogan didn’t claim AI had “won.” She highlighted how powerful tools can reshape workflows when used thoughtfully. That balanced perspective is exactly what Google’s E-E-A-T framework values: experience, expertise, authority, and trust.\n\nJaana Dogan did not set out to start a global debate. She simply shared an authentic professional observation. Yet that moment revealed something important: AI tools are no longer just assistants. They are becoming collaborators.\n\nThe future of software development will not be purely human or purely automated. It will sit somewhere in between. Engineers like Jaana Dogan help the industry understand that future clearly, without hype or fear.\n\nAnd that clarity, more than speed or novelty, is what truly matters.\n\nThe Indian Express – Global Technology Coverage\n\nThe Economic Times – AI & Software Industry News\n\nJaana Dogan is a Principal Engineer at Google who works on advanced artificial intelligence systems,\n\nincluding projects related to Google’s Gemini AI ecosystem. She is known for sharing real-world\n\ninsights on how AI tools impact modern software development.\n\nJaana Dogan’s AI experiment went viral because she revealed that an AI coding tool recreated a system\n\nsimilar to her team’s year-long engineering work in about one hour, sparking debate about AI’s role\n\nin software development.\n\nNo, AI did not replace human engineers in Jaana Dogan’s experiment. The AI-generated code acted as a\n\nprototype and still required human expertise for validation, testing, optimization, and long-term\n\nsystem responsibility.\n\nA distributed agent orchestrator is a software system that coordinates multiple autonomous agents,\n\nmanages communication between them, and ensures tasks execute reliably across distributed computing\n\nenvironments.\n\nJaana Dogan’s experience shows that AI can dramatically speed up early-stage development and\n\nprototyping, while human engineers remain essential for system design, ethical decisions, quality\n\ncontrol, and long-term maintenance.",

REUTERS/Allison Bailey\n\nThe Trump administration has executed a wide-ranging crackdown on freedom of speech by targeting student protestors, lawyers and the press. Global Insight assesses the threat to the rule of law and what is being done to protect it.\n\nOn 8 March, recent Colombia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil was returning home from dinner with his eight-month pregnant wife when he was arrested and forced into an unmarked car by four agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Khalil, a legal resident in the US, had been a leader of the pro-Palestine protests on Colombia’s campus last spring. He is being held in a detention facility in Louisiana awaiting deportation and has not been charged with a crime.\n\n‘They are targeting the most vulnerable people who are standing up for Palestinian rights,’ says Justin Mazzola, Deputy Director of Research at Amnesty International USA, which is working closely with the lawyers on Khalil’s case. ‘The idea is to basically get people to stop protesting what’s happening in Gaza.’\n\nIn the short time that US president Donald Trump has held power, his administration has weaponised the federal government to suppress speech and punish his adversaries. In what many experts have challenged as a violation of First Amendment rights, a cornerstone of US democracy, President Trump has threatened protestors, banned news outlets from covering White House events and used executive orders to sanction law firms who he believes attacked him unfairly in the past. Subsequent court cases will test America’s most fundamental checks and balances on executive power.\n\nJonathan Hafetz\n\n Membership Officer, IBA Human Rights Law Committee\n\n‘We are seeing the gravest assault on freedom of speech at least since the McCarthy era, and I think in many respects the nation’s history,’ says Jonathan Hafetz, a professor of law at Seton Hall Law School and Membership Officer of the IBA Human Rights Law Committee.\n\nThe high-profile arrest of Khalil is part of a series of actions taken by the Trump administration against foreign students who have expressed support for Palestinians. Students and faculty members at US universities across the country have been detained by federal agents and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that his department has revoked at least 300 foreign students’ visas. Following arrests, government lawyers have cited a provision of a rarely used 1952 immigration law that allows the Secretary of State to revoke visas or permanent residency from anyone judged to be undermining US foreign policy. Jameel Jaffer, the inaugural director of the Knight First Amendment Institute, an independent organisation founded by Colombia University, believes that the arrests and detentions of foreign students are ‘impossible to reconcile’ with the First Amendment, and predicts that the courts will eventually make clear that it protects non-citizens from deportation. ‘At the most basic level if the First Amendment means anything it means that the government can’t arrest you or imprison you for political speech,’ he says. ‘That is the core protection of the First Amendment.’\n\nIn March, the national American Association of University Professors (AAUP), AAUP chapters at Havard, NYU and Rutgers, and the Middle East Studies Association, represented by the Knight Institute, filed a lawsuit in Boston seeking to block the arrests, detentions and deportations of international students and staff ‘who participate in pro-Palestinian protests and other protected First Amendment activities.’\n\nJaffer adds, however, that the question of whether the Trump administration will comply with any court rulings remains. ‘Both the court’s willingness to enforce their orders and the Trump administration’s decisions about how to respond to the court orders will be influenced by perceptions of public opinion,’ he says.\n\nAlongside visa revocations in recent months the US government commenced a widespread termination of Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records from a national database. A visa revocation, while significant, only impacts a person’s ability to return to the country, whereas eliminating a student’s SEVIS status puts them at risk of deportation. The government has since reversed the policy and reactivated most records following hundreds of lawsuits filed by students who said their records had been terminated based on charges that had been dismissed or minor offences that would not warrant a cancellation. NAFSA, an educational non-profit, found that some SEVIS record terminations referenced ‘potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.’\n\nAdam Cohen, an immigration lawyer and partner at Siskind Susser in Tennessee, is concerned by the lack of due process and transparency related to the SEVIS terminations, which he says could resume at any time. ‘The problem is when they’re terminating the SEVIS record, they’re making people believe that they need to leave immediately and they’re not even getting to that hearing in an immigration court,’ he says. ‘It’s not even clear what the issue was right? What was the adverse foreign policy? In certain cases, did they repost something on social media?’\n\nIn addition to the crackdown on international students the White House has threatened to withdraw millions of dollars in federal funding from at least 60 universities unless they agree to a set of demands to address alleged failures to comply with federal civil rights laws related to antisemitism and drop diversity, equity and inclusion policies. In response, elite US university Havard has filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing the funding freeze violates procedural requirements and its First Amendment Rights to freedom of speech. To restore its funding, Colombia University agreed to many of the administration’s demands including allowing security officers to remove or arrest individuals and taking control of its Middle East department from faculty.\n\nJameel Jaffer\n\n Director, Knight First Amendment Institute\n\nIn response to the action against Colombia, of the country’s top constitutional professors, both liberal and conservatives, wrote an open letter critical of the Trump administration’s use of funding cuts ‘as a tool to pressure recipients into suppressing First-Amendment protected speech,' which can extend to viewpoints ‘many of us find wrongheaded or deeply offensive.’ The First Amendment offers broad protections and guarantees freedom of the press, speech, religion, the right to assemble and the right to petition the government.\n\nJaffer says the damage being done while students and universities wait for court judgments is significant. ‘It has created a climate of fear and repression on campuses across the country,’ he says. ‘It’s caused an intense chilling effect and really changed the character of American universities quite dramatically.’\n\nIn certain cases, the question of whether the executive branch would defy a ruling by a federal judge has already been answered. In February the chief judge of the US Court for the District of Colombia ordered the US government to halt deportation flights carrying immigrants alleged to be Venezuelan gang members. But officials chose to ignore the order. ‘This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!’ President Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social. In April, the FBI arrested a judge in Wisconsin for allegedly helping an undocumented migrant evade arrest.\n\nFollowing the Trump administration’s refusal to turn the planes around, many commentators have declared the US in a constitutional crisis. Steven Richman is Chair of the IBA’s Bar Issue Commission and a member at Clark Hill. He says while Trump undermining judges is concerning, the fears about him transforming the US into an authoritarian state should be placed in context. ‘Since Marbury v Madison established the primacy of judicial review in 1803, by which the federal courts could declare legislation, as well as executive and administrative actions as unconstitutional, presidents of various parties from time to time have been alleged to have defied the Supreme Court. The facts of each situation and specific rulings of the Court remain important to evaluate the executive’s conduct. What is significant is that there remains an acknowledgement that the rule of law governs, and Marbury v Madison remains in place.’\nSome of the most aggressive escalations of the Trump administration’s assaults on the legal system have manifested in a barrage of executive orders punishing large commercial law firms who have represented his political opponents or been involved in causes against him. The orders, which allege wrongdoing by individual lawyers and civil rights law violations by affirmative action schemes, terminate the firms from government contracts and restrict their employees from access to federal buildings. To avoid the sanctions, multiple law firms have cut deals with President Trump and collectively agreed to provide $940m in pro bono work for causes his administration supports. Others have decided to stand firm.\n\n‘The order is a plain violation of the First Amendment,’ Jenner & Block said, which, alongside Perkins Coie and WilmerHale, successfully obtained preliminary court rulings to block the executive orders. ‘Our constitution forbids attempts by the government to retaliate against citizens and lawyers based on the clients they represent, the positions they advocate, the opinions they voice and the people with whom they associate.’\n\nRichman says the government using executive power to take revenge on lawyers is problematic and a direct challenge to the independence of the legal profession. ‘If someone feels that a law firm has brought a frivolous or legally unjustified claim, there are remedies at law for pursuing such claims. The end can never justify the means. The means – due process, fairness, respect for the social contract and political will that underlies a system – must be respected.’\n\nIn response to the executive orders more than 500 law firms signed an amicus brief, accusing the Trump administration of a campaign of ‘draconian punishment’ against lawyers who have acted for clients it disapproves of. ‘Whatever short-term advantage the administration may gain from exercising power in this way, the rule of law cannot endure in the climate of fear that such actions create.’\n\nSome lawyers at firms who are unhappy with their employer’s decision to negotiate a deal with President Trump have quit their jobs in protest. One such former associate, Rachel Cohen, gave up her role at a prestigious white shoe law firm because of its decision not to challenge the Trump administration’s sanctioning of the legal profession. ‘I sent what I considered a conditional resignation that either we need to do something about this real infringement on the legal system, on democracy, on traditional impartiality, or I can’t work here anymore.’\n\nCohen, who has now joined recently launched firm Lowell and Associates, which is dedicated to representing those facing legal actions from the Trump administration, believes that the agreements law firms are reaching with Trump are shortsighted, especially in the cases where they have proactively made a deal with Trump to avoid an executive order being issued in the first place. ‘I don’t know why anyone would think that a president who has a history of not respecting people who he has entered into deals with would respect the terms of a terrible deal when people have shown them what their weak spots are,’ she says.\n\nLower courts have been strong in opposing President Trump’s efforts to undermine the legal system and suppress freedom of speech. A federal judge in Washington, DC temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order against Susman Godfrey, which helped Dominion (a manufacturer of voting machines that lawyers for Trump falsely accused of deleting votes for him in the 2020 election) secure a $700m settlement to resolve a defamation case against Fox News. The judge called the executive order ‘a shocking abuse of power’, which stemmed from a ‘personal vendetta.'\n\n‘It was a clear attempt to retaliate against the law firm for representing a client that was seeking to hold Fox News to account for spreading lies and misinformation about the 2020 election,’ says Hafetz. ‘This is why it is so surprising and disappointing that some law firms have sought to cut deals with the Trump administration because those firms that have fought back have been vindicated and received relief.’\n\nIn its statement after the settlement, Fox acknowledged that the court found some of its statements about Dominion to be false, but said its settlement ‘reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards.’\n\nAlongside law firms, major media organisations have chosen to negotiate with Trump rather than challenge his attacks. In the run up to President Trump’s inauguration ABC News quickly settled a defamation lawsuit filed by Trump and Meta agreed to pay $25m to resolve a lawsuit over its decision to suspend Trump from its social media platforms following the January 6 attack on the US capital. In another notable move, the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times pulled their presidential endorsements.\n\nSince taking office, the Trump administration has taken an aggressive approach to news organisations it disfavours. The Federal Communications Commission has opened investigations into ABC, CBS and NBC News. In February, the White House announced that it had banned the Associated Press from accessing certain press events because of its refusal to rename a body of water the Gulf of America. The White House said it would also exert greater control over which news outlets would get access to the president.\n\nPeople take part in a rally organised by Jewish activists against the detention by ICE agents of Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil in New York City, U.S., 20 March 2025. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz\n\nGovernments favouring certain news organisations over others ‘is part of the authoritarian playbook,’ says Mark Stephens, Co-Chair of the IBA’s Human Rights Institute. ‘Banning the Associated Press essentially covering Trump in the way you would normally expect is designed to interfere with the free flow of information.’\n\nMel Bunce, a professor of international journalism and politics at City St George’s, University of London, says that the seriousness of the ban is underscored by the vital role of the Associated Press as a conduit for information. ‘The Associated Press is an incredibly important news organisation that is relied on by hundreds of news outlets around the world. Alongside Reuters and AFP, it is one of the most important building blocks of the international news system,’ she says. ‘It is one of the most rigorous and fact-based news organisations, and their news is shared globally – to millions of people in audiences around the world. And that’s why this is such a red flag.’\n\nWhile targeting the mainstream media, the Trump administration has branded itself as the ultimate defender of free speech. Trump officials backed up by billionaire social media owners have become fervent critics of ‘censorship’ coming from ‘woke’ progressivism that, they argue, would like to constrain the First Amendment.\n\nIn April a federal judge in a preliminary injunction ordered the White House to restore the access of The Associated Press access to cover presidential events, affirming on First Amendment grounds that the government cannot punish the news organisation for the content of its speech. Trump administration lawyers argued in court filings that the Associated Press does not have a constitutional right to specific presidential events.\n\nIn a show of solidarity against the ban, 40 news organisations signed a letter urging the White House to reverse the restrictions on the Associated Press. The signatories included outlets like Fox News and Newsmax, where many of the broadcasters and audience members are Trump supporters.\n\nAmy Brouillette is Director of Advocacy at the International Press Institute, an organisation that works to defend press freedom and independent journalism. ‘Limiting access to media pool events because of the news agency’s editorial decisions stifles freedom of speech,’ she says. ‘News organisations should be allowed to make editorial decisions without fear of retaliation from government officials.’\n\nIn another setback to the Trump administration a federal judge temporarily blocked its dismantling of state-funded broadcaster Voice of America, following an executive order accusing it of being ‘anti-Trump’ and ‘radical’. The director of Voice of America, Mike Abramowitz announced that almost his entire staff of 1,300 people had been placed on administrative leave.\n\nThe Trump administration’s decision to dismantle the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and the 90-day freeze on foreign development assistance funding, is also impacting independent journalism internationally. ‘The recent freezing of USAID is having a very serious impact on the media and civil society organisations that play a role in ensuring accountability and transparency,’ says Brouillette. ‘The role that the media and civil society play is not only important for democracy but it’s also important for peace and security.’\n\nAlice Johnson is the IBA Multimedia Journalist and can be contacted at alice.johnson@int-bar.org",

    "title": "FEC Obstructed from Enforcing Campaign Finance Laws for Last 250 Days",
    "description": "The Federal Election Commission needs its ability to function restored, without sacrificing its independence.",
    "fullText": "Since Thursday, the bipartisan Federal Election Commission hasn’t been able do its job. That’s because the independent agency, which oversees money in campaigns for federal office, no longer has the minimum four required members to do most business.\n\nThe loss of quorum is due to the resignation of a Republican appointee, coupled with President Trump’s unprecedented move in February to fire a Democratic appointee. Such a shortfall has only happened three other times in the FEC’s 50-year history, including twice during Trump’s first term.\n\nOrdinarily, the big question would be how fast the president and Congress will move to restore a full complement of commissioners so the agency can function. That is still important. But in light of the firing and the president’s other steps to exert control over the FEC and other independent agencies, there is now a much bigger issue: Will the FEC be able to continue as an independent watchdog at all? Because even worse than a dormant FEC is one that could be weaponized against the president’s opponents.\n\nThe FEC was created as part of the post-Watergate reforms that established our current system of campaign contribution limits and disclosure requirements. It is led by six commissioners, no more than three of whom can be from one party. When fewer than four seats are filled, the commission cannot carry out most of its important functions, including enforcing the law and issuing regulations and other legal guidance.\n\nThanks in part to its evenly divided leadership, the FEC is nobody’s idea of an aggressive watchdog, often deadlocking on partisan lines in important matters. That gridlock has exacerbated the effects of Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United, for instance, by making it easier for candidates to outsource key campaign operations to super PACs that can raise unlimited amounts of money.\n\nBut even a dysfunctional FEC is still important. Among other things, the agency plays a vital role in collecting and disseminating campaign finance data, which is critical at a time when Trump and his Democratic opponents continue raising money at a rapid clip ahead of the 2026 midterms (and when a number of the president’s biggest donors have a hand in shaping policy in his administration).\n\nLoss of the FEC’s quorum won’t keep data from being collected and published, but the commission won’t be able to do anything to enforce reporting requirements against those who ignore them. It also can’t address novel legal issues that arise — for instance, in connection to online campaign activity, where significant reporting gaps remain.\n\nBut the loss of the FEC’s quorum may not even be the agency’s biggest challenge. In February, the president fired a sitting Democratic appointee, Ellen Weintraub (full disclosure: I worked for Weintraub from 2011 to 2014). This firing is the reason the FEC was down to only four commissioners before the latest resignation.\n\nTo be sure, Weintraub’s term at the commission had long expired and she was eligible to be replaced. But no president has ever removed an FEC commissioner from the opposing party without naming a replacement, usually selected by the opposition party’s congressional leaders. Her removal was part of a series of firings of Democratic commissioners at independent agencies who are supposed to be legally insulated from presidential removal — representing a major power grab by the White House.\n\nSeveral weeks later, the White House issued an executive order purporting to formally place all independent executive branch agencies under direct presidential control. The president subsequently issued an order that, among other things, directs the Election Assistance Commission — another federal agency that was modeled in key respects on the FEC — to illegally revise federal voter registration procedures. A federal court has blocked relevant parts of the order in a Brennan Center lawsuit challenging the move while the case proceeds.\n\nThe president’s assault on the independence of agencies like the Elections Assistance Commission and FEC flies in the face of Article I of the Constitution, which vests oversight over federal elections in the states and Congress. Congress in turn delegated oversight over federal campaign finance rules to the independent FEC with the goal — as we recently noted in a publicly filed comment to the agency — of ensuring that election-related complaints and questions would be handled free from partisan manipulation.\n\nThe record-breaking 2024 election showed the dire need for effective and scrupulously even-handed campaign finance regulation. At a bare minimum, the president and Congress should follow the practices of every president since the 1970s for filling opposing party seats on the commission. Nominees from both parties should also be asked whether they will explicitly commit to defending the FEC’s independence.\n\nUltimately, as frustrating as some of the FEC’s current failings are, the solution can never be to allow the agency to be weaponized for partisan ends. There has long been broad, bipartisan agreement on this point — and it’s more important than ever to reaffirm this commitment to fairness.",

    "description": "The hard-hitting attack version of the special operations MH-60 was clearly among the critical assets used in Operation Absolute Resolve.",
    "fullText": "In the aftermath of the high-profile capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro by the United States, the participation by the Direct Action Penetrator (DAP) version of the U.S. Army’s MH-60M Black Hawk has thrust one of the most intriguing Special Operations Command (SOCOM) assets into the spotlight. These aircraft are the heavier-hitting gunships of the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), better known as the Night Stalkers, and Venezuela was exactly the kind of mission for which they are intended to fly, in support of a direct action mission and assault team.\n\nTWZ readers can otherwise get up to speed on the details that are known so far about the operation in our initial reporting here and here.\n\nHeavily armed attack versions of the H-60 Black Hawk family have been used by a variety of nations through the years. However, the specially adapted DAPs flown by the 160th SOAR are undoubtedly the best equipped, even in comparison to the regiment’s standard MH-60s, which are used primarily as transports, and are extremely capable in their own right.\n\nThe 160th SOAR has been operating the tricked-out DAP versions of the Black Hawk since at least 1990, with a primary mission of armed escort and fire support. Currently, the unit only operates the MH-60M version. These are flown alongside the M/AH-6M Little Bird, which also have a gunship configuration, and the MH-47G Chinook; the latter type was also employed in Operation Absolute Resolve in Venezuela.\n\nSeveral videos have emerged from Operation Absolute Resolve showing the MH-60M DAP in action, including reportedly during the assault on Fort Tiuna in Caracas, which you can read more about here. This footage has also been identified by some accounts as showing U.S. Marine Corps AH-1Z Vipers, but it was a DAP. These aircraft are meant to work very close to their targets, with the signature combined strafe and rocket barrage being a primary tactic.\n\nFootage of a U.S. helicopter firing rockets at a ground target in Caracas, Venezuela tonight. pic.twitter.com/5F81gePPin\n\n— OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) January 3, 2026\n\n— Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) January 3, 2026\n\nFootage shows a United States Marine Corps (USMC) AH-1Z Viper attack helicopter engaging ground targets with gun and rocket fire in Caracas, Venezuela.

These wings can be configured with one or two hardpoints on each side. It’s also worth noting that the MH-60M aircraft are dual-role; each one can be converted back into a transport helo from a DAP configuration in a couple of hours or less. This provides a lot of contingency capability in a single aircraft.\n\nIn terms of armament, the DAPs can carry a combination of 70mm rockets, AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, Stinger ATAS (air-to-air missiles), GAU-19/B 50-cal machine guns, and 30mm M230 cannons. The M230 is the same gun found on the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. In addition, the DAP has a pair of 7.62mm Miniguns that can be locked in a forward-firing mode to add to the firepower. The 70mm rockets include Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) versions, with laser guidance, allowing the DAPs to strike with extreme precision.\n\nThe particular configuration seen in the photos below is known as COMNAV IDAP and is typical of how the DAP appeared in Afghanistan in 2012:\n\nThe stores-carrying ability of the 160th’s MH-60Ms has been refined through the introduction of all-new lightweight wings, known as the Multi-Station Lightweight Armament Support Structure (MLASS). These are lighter than the older sponsons and easier for troops to install and remove as necessary. The older ESSS wings and single pylon wings are also available.\n\nAside from the weapons capabilities of the DAP version, the baseline MH-60M is absolutely packed with specialized avionics and systems vital for its critical missions, which are typically flown under the most demanding conditions and primarily at night. Among the most important of these systems are a terrain following radar and a sensor turret with day and night-vision cameras, which we will come back to shortly. Having the same avionics also means the DAP is able to penetrate to the same places as the other 160th SOAR aircraft they are tasked to support.\n\nThe DAP version also benefits from the rolling program of upgrades that keep the MH-60M at the top of its game. For example, the engine air filters seen on the current MH-60M configuration were added specifically because of foreign object damage (FOD) ingestion issues, which particularly affected the DAP, including rocket smoke and shell casings that were found to fly into the intakes during diving attacks.\n\nAt the front of the MH-60M, mounted in the center of the nose, is the terrain-following/terrain avoidance radar. The newer and more capable AN/APQ-187 Silent Knight radar, or SKR, has been steadily replacing the AN/APQ-174 radar. The SKR is also found on Night Stalker MH-47Gs, as well as U.S. Air Force CV-22 Osprey tiltrotors and MC-130J Commando II special operations tanker/transports.\n\nIn both cases, the radar is essential for the MH-60M to safely fly extremely low-altitude nap-of-the-earth flight profiles, even in poor weather and at night. This is exactly the kind of tactics that would have been used in Venezuela and will also have contributed to keeping the helicopters away from enemy air defenses and avoiding detection in general. As far as we know, only one helicopter was damaged in the Maduro snatch, but returned from its mission.\n\nFootage shows Venezuelan ground forces utilizing a MANPADS at a helicopter from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment during the final phase of Operation Absolute Resolve. \n\nShortly after the launch, retaliatory fire was observed, likely delivered by MH-60M DAPs or… pic.twitter.com/ZEhc8rZFBL\n\n— GMI (@Global_Mil_Info) January 4, 2026\n\nOn the nose directly below the radar is the AN/ZSQ-2 sensor turret, which houses electro-optical and infrared full-motion video cameras, as well as a laser rangefinder. The DAP version of the turret additionally features a laser designator for guiding weapons.\n\nAnother important tool that aids navigation through dust, sand, snow, fog, and other ‘degraded’ environments is the Degraded Visual Environment Pilotage System (DVEPS). It uses a combination of cameras and LIDAR, linked to a terrain database, to do this. Among its sensors is the AN/ZSQ-2, seen to the left of the radar in the photo below.\n\nThere are perhaps no helicopters anywhere in the world that are better protected than the 160th SOAR’s fleet.\n\nThe MH-60M is no exception, bristling with arrays of defensive systems all around the aircraft, creating a sphere of situational awareness and protection against multiple kinds of guided threats.\n\nThe defensive suite on the helicopter combines visual/infrared missile, radar, and laser warning sensors, which work together with active jammers and other electronic warfare systems, laser countermeasures, as well as countermeasures dispensers on either side of the tail boom.\n\nThe self-protection systems used by the 160th SOAR fleet are regularly updated to keep pace with changing threats. Among the latest defensive additions to the MH-60M is the Common Infrared Countermeasures (CIRCM) system. As a directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) system, this uses laser beams to blind and confuse the seekers on infrared-homing missiles. CIRCM is integrated with existing warning sensors, which it uses to cue the lasers against incoming threats. The same system is also being fitted on regular Army Black Hawks, as well as CH-47s and AH-64s.\n\nShould the MH-60M crew get ‘painted’ by enemy radars or lasers, or if there’s an enemy missile incoming, they will be warned by the defensive sensors, which will also automatically trigger electronic jamming, the launch of decoy flares and/or radar-spoofing chaff, and/or trigger the CIRCM system. It’s all highly integrated to maximized survivability.\n\nAlso part of the survivability equation is just knowing where threats may be, especially if they pop-up out of nowhere. This is where the aircraft’s electronic support measures, also tied into its defensive suite, provides situational awareness to the crew in order to give them the option of avoiding or engaging threats on the fly. Other threat data is datalinked to the aircraft from various platforms, enhancing overall situational awareness.\n\nOn that note, the MH-60M DAP, in common with all special operations Black Hawks, boasts an extensive communications suite, as evidenced by the dense array of antennas above and below the fuselage. There is also a prominent satellite communications antenna directly above the cockpit.\n\nAs we just discussed in relation to the Venezuela operation earlier today, the Army, and especially the 160th SOAR, has been experimenting with employing launched effects from their H-60s for years now, though this is not an operational capability, at least that we know of at present. These are drones capable of being launched from helicopters (as well as other platforms) that can fly dozens or even hundreds of miles to strike targets, jam emitters, or decoy air defenses, among other tasks. Launched effects are seen as essential to the survivability of helicopters in the future.\n\nThe video below, which the Army released in 2021, includes footage at around the 0:34 mark in the runtime of one of 160th SOAR’s MH-60 Black Hawk helicopters carrying a tube for a ‘launched effect’ under its right stub wing.\n\nLaunched effects are also planned for the Army’s conventional Black Hawk fleet, but the Night Stalkers, and the DAP version of the MH-60M in particular, are likely to receive it first. In Venezuela, launched effects would have allowed the DAP to strike targets indirectly and respond to air defenses as they emerged, launching kinetic attacks to get the main formation of helicopters through to their target. There is some evidence this may have happened for the first time in combat during this operation.\n\nLast but not least, as an MH-60M derivative, the DAP has accommodation for the nose-mounted boom for the in-flight refueling probe. This is telescopic, extending when required to keep the tanker and the trailing drogue clear of the rotor blades. This gives the helicopter much longer range, limited not by fuel onboard but by crew fatigue, lubrication consumption and other factors. They usually refuel from their MC-130J counterparts.\n\nOverall, the DAP version of the MH-60M has a strong claim to being the most heavily armed and best-protected Black Hawk iteration. While it might not be as heavily modified as the stealth Black Hawk, with its radical low-observable features, this remains very much under wraps, and its current status is altogether unclear.\n\nAs it stands, the MH-60M DAP’s combination of heavy armament, radar, and other sensor capabilities, as well as its extensive self-protection and communications systems, made it an obvious candidate in Venezuela. In the case of this raid, DAPs likely pursued troops responding at the complex that was under attack. They would have been tasked with taking out targets such as armored vehicles and anti-aircraft guns, as well as hitting any known threats just before the assaulters arrived. Critical is the fact that the DAPs can operate as an extremely well-trained integrated team with their 160th SOAR stablemates, working seamlessly as a ‘contained’ unit in the most demanding of circumstances. It would be much harder to bring in another ‘big Army’ asset for the same kind of effect.\n\nHopefully, we will in the future learn more details about its role — and that of the wider 160th SOAR — in Operation Absolute Resolve.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

    "description": "About a dozen oil tankers loaded with Venezuelan crude and fuel have left the country's waters since the start of the year in apparent defiance of the U.S. government's blockade on",
    "fullText": "Jan 5 (Reuters) - About a dozen oil tankers loaded with Venezuelan crude and fuel have left the country's waters since the start of the year in apparent defiance of the U.S. government's blockade on exports, according to documents seen by Reuters and industry sources including monitoring service TankerTrackers.com.\n\nU.S. President Donald ​Trump imposed a blockade of all sanctioned tankers bound for Venezuela in mid-December, before the dramatic capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by U.S. troops in ‌the early hours of Saturday morning. Trump said on Saturday that an oil embargo remained in full force after Maduro's extraction.\n\nAll the departed vessels identified are under sanctions and most are now sailing on the high seas ‌without any known flag or current ship safety documentation in place, shipping data showed. Half of them are supertankers that typically carry Venezuelan crude to China, according to TankerTrackers.com and shipping documents from PDVSA.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the U.S. had approved or allowed the shipments. Trump also said on Saturday that Venezuela's largest customers, including China, would keep receiving oil.\n\nA U.S. official told Reuters on Monday the vessel \"quarantine\" was in effect focused on sanctioned tankers, but did not elaborate on the departed ships.\n\nThe White House, the U.S. State Department, state-run Venezuelan oil company PDVSA ⁠and Venezuela's oil ministry did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe ‌vessels are carrying an estimated volume of 12 million barrels of Venezuelan heavy crude and fuel oil, according to deals negotiated with PDVSA and satellite images analyzed by TankerTrackers.com.\n\nIt was unclear where the vessels were heading. When they loaded in December, they were mostly destined for Asia. ‍The ships had been stuck in Venezuelan waters since due to the U.S. blockade.\n\nA separate group of three smaller empty ships, also under sanctions, left the country after completing domestic trips or discharging imports, including of Russian naphtha.\n\nAt least four of the departed tankers left Venezuelan waters on Saturday through a route north of Margarita island after briefly stopping near the country's maritime border, TankerTrackers.com said.\n\nAt least four supertankers ​had been cleared by Venezuelan authorities to leave in dark mode, three sources with knowledge of the departure paperwork told Reuters. That means the vessels sail without their ‌satellite tracking devices switched on, a common ploy for tankers in the global fleet that carry sanctioned oil from Venezuela, Iran and Russia around the world.",

    "title": "I'm a dietitian on the Mediterranean diet. Here are 12 things I buy at Trader Joe's when I don't feel like cooking.",
    "description": "As a registered dietitian who follows the Mediterranean diet but dislikes cooking, I use low-effort Trader Joe's staples to make easy meals or snacks.",
    "fullText": "When I tell people I've been a registered dietitian for more than 20 years, the assumption is that I love to eat nutritious foods and cook them myself.\n\nI try to mostly eat balanced and nutrient-dense meals that follow the Mediterranean diet — which focuses on consuming lots of whole grains and produce while limiting red meats and processed foods — but I don't enjoy spending time planning, cooking, and cleaning.\n\nThankfully, Trader Joe's has some gems that help me feed my entire family (including a picky child).\n\nHere are some of my must-buy items that I use to help create healthy and easy meals without spending too much time in the kitchen.\n\nEditor's Note: Product price and availability may vary.\n\nEnvy apples can be added to salads, \"girl dinners,\" or lunchboxes for an extra crunch, a boost of fiber, and balanced sweetness.\n\nThey're appealing because their insides tend to stay whiter longer, allowing for slicing or chopping without worrying too much about being stuck with discolored fruit.\n\nSalmon from Norway is known for its pure taste, beautiful color, and firm flesh. Much of that is due to its balanced fat content and firm texture.\n\nIt's also nutrient-dense, providing essentials such as omega-3; vitamins D, B12, and A; and selenium. Plus, it's incredibly easy to cook, especially if I remember to marinate it the night before.\n\nI don't follow a vegan diet, but that doesn't stop me from purchasing this plant-based pesto from Trader Joe's to use on pasta dishes, sandwiches, or as a dip.\n\nContaining kale, cashew, and basil, this pesto is also my secret ingredient in killer grilled-cheese sandwiches.\n\nIf it were socially acceptable to drink Trader Joe's vegan creamy dill dressing with a straw, I'd do it. I love that it's free from fillers or emulsifiers, and the flavor is incredibly satisfying.\n\nThe obvious way to enjoy this dressing is on top of a salad. However, I also use it as a saucy addition to chicken or fish meals, an ingredient in grain-based dishes, and a condiment on sandwiches.\n\nNot loving to cook also means not loving to prep snacks. However, because I lead an active lifestyle, I know I need to fuel myself with nutrients such as sustainable carbohydrates before starting a workout.\n\nClif Bars are crafted with a blend of plant-based protein, fat, and carbohydrates. They're my favorite pre-workout snack that requires zero effort in the kitchen.\n\nThis frozen blend of blueberries, bananas, strawberries, dragon fruit, spinach, and kale makes smoothie-making so easy.\n\nThere's no chopping or prepping required when I'm in the mood for a breakfast smoothie — I simply toss some of this into a blender with milk.\n\nVeggies are a must at dinnertime in my house. Having prewashed and cut veggie and produce kits, such as the Trader Joe's asparagus sauté with mushrooms and onions, makes cooking dinner a breeze.\n\nSimply open the package and sauté everything in some extra-virgin olive oil.\n\nWhole grains can be both nutritious and filling. For those who don't like spending too much time in the kitchen, cooking them can be a tedious task.\n\nPrecooked frozen grains, such as Trader Joe's bulgur pilaf with squash and feta, only need to be heated through. Plus, this one is made with butternut squash, and I like the boost of veggies in every bite.\n\nTrader Joe's frozen precooked cauliflower rice is a perfect base for a low-carb meal. I just add a protein to make it a more complete dish.\n\nFor people who don't love cauliflower rice — but tolerate it because they want to include more veggies in their diet (such as my husband) — mixing this dish with some regular rice can offer the best of both worlds.\n\nPrecooked and shelled hard-boiled eggs make for an easy breakfast protein, salad topping, or sandwich addition.\n\nYes, even dietitians want to have pizza night once in a while.\n\nTrader Joe's frozen Tarte au Brie et aux Tomates satisfies the fiercest pizza craving. Plus, heating it up takes less time than we'd spend waiting for a pie to be delivered from the local pizzeria.\n\nI enjoy one serving as a main course, accompanied by a side salad, for a complete meal.\n\nClick to keep reading Trader Joe's diaries like this one.\n\nThis story was originally published on September 25, 2023, and most recently updated on January 5, 2025.",

    "description": "I followed a partner to Texas from California, then left both the state and relationship. I learned an important lesson about making my own decisions.",
    "fullText": "Shortly after earning my Bachelor's degree, I did what any confused 21-year-old would do: I moved to be with a partner.\n\nThe decision surprised a lot of people in my life. My dad raised his eyebrows at my choice to move for love and to make Texas my home.\n\nAfter all, I'd always dreamed of moving to New York, where I'd launch my writing career.\n\nHowever, moving to Texas seemed like a good option at the time. It's where my long-distance partner was living and working, and I was fresh out of college and eager to leave my California hometown.\n\nLooking back now, I was leaning on a romanticized version of what moving would mean — a fresh start and a deepening of our LDR — instead of thinking about what I really wanted.\n\nI arrived in northern Texas during a mid-summer nightmare of humidity. I couldn't walk outside without feeling like I'd just entered a sauna — a sharp contrast to California's dry heat.\n\nFrom the very beginning, I tried to find community and make living here work, convincing myself I'd adjust if I just put in enough effort.\n\nBut I had a tough time finding things to do in my new suburb. Quiet nights and weekends left me daydreaming about New York City and its seemingly endless array of activities and events even more.\n\nCrucially, I also found it incredibly difficult to meet anyone who felt similar to me.\n\nMy Dallas suburb felt much more conservative than my California hometown, and a lot of the people in our neighborhood were avid churchgoers, whereas I'm not religious.\n\nAround this time, too, I was coming to terms with the fact that I also liked women romantically. I struggled to find the kinds of queer spaces that seemed more plentiful in larger cities and bluer states.\n\nAs much as I tried to appreciate the mountainless views and endless selection of barbecue, I struggled to connect with my new town — and I couldn't stop thinking about the life I wanted in New York.\n\nSix months in, I took a quick trip back to California to visit my dad.\n\nTaking some time away from Texas made me confront the truth: I couldn't stay there anymore.\n\nThroughout my entire time in the state, I'd been daydreaming about packing up my things and living in New York City. My partner, on the other hand, wanted life in the country, and we just ended up not being compatible.\n\nThe Lone Star State helped bring all of these realizations to light.\n\nI knew that if I had chosen to stay, I'd continue to feel like a stranger in my own life. I realized that I'd rather take on the \"sunk cost\" of moving than stay in a place and relationship that didn't suit me.\n\nI learned a lot about myself during this time — including the fact that, maybe unsurprisingly, a suburb in northern Texas was not a great long-term fit for me. The biggest lesson I learned, though, was never to give up my own hopes and dreams for the sake of a relationship.\n\nDon't get me wrong: Moving for a partner can work for some people, but at 21, I learned the importance of making life decisions with my own wants and needs in mind.\n\nNow, almost a decade later, I'm writing this from my New York City apartment. I'm in a city where I've found my purpose, the love of my life, and most importantly, happiness.\n\nLeaving Texas turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made.",

    "fullText": "Celebrities are kicking off 2026 in dramatic fashion — literally.\n\nOn Sunday night, Hollywood stars flocked to Santa Monica for the 2026 Critics Choice Awards, which celebrate the best of film and TV.\n\nSome attendees, such as Ariana Grande, stood out in glamorous, sparkling ensembles, while others fell short with lackluster looks.\n\nThese are the best and worst outfits we saw.\n\nThe \"Sentimental Value\" star hit the red carpet in a sleeveless gown designed by Ralph Lauren.\n\nThe shimmering dress had thin straps, a plunging cowl neckline, and a form-fitting skirt that extended into a short train.\n\nFanning stood out in the elegant gown, which perfectly complemented her blonde hair and neutral makeup.\n\nShe wore a strapless, sparkle-covered gown with a structured bodice and ruched fabric across its floor-length skirt.\n\nIts shape worked strongly for the actor, but its gray-toned color washed her out. A brighter silver or gold coloring might have worked better.\n\nIt also would've been fun to see Silverstone wear her hair in an updo to highlight her diamond earrings and statement dress.\n\nThe \"Andor\" actor arrived at the Critics Choice Awards wearing a forest green suit and undershirt.\n\nThough the outfit's earthy colors looked great on Luna, its satin pieces fit loosely and seemed to need some tailoring. His pants, especially, looked too long.\n\nThe outfit was also very understated and could have been enhanced with some accessories, such as rings or a brooch.\n\nThey coordinated in all-black ensembles that showcased their respective styles.\n\nRei Ami donned a velvet gown with a dramatic bodice cutout and wrist accessories from Chochengco, while Ejae had a glamorous moment in a strapless, satin ball gown.\n\nAudrey Nuna took the most daring approach, wearing a sculptural sphere piece from Marc Jacobs.\n\nSaint Laurent designed her dramatic look. It featured a tan suit, a massive feather boa across her shoulders, black gloves, a red tie, and leather boots that extended up her thighs.\n\nA simpler pair of shoes, such as boots that sat under her pant legs, would have probably looked better with the outfit.\n\nLaw Roach and Yvonne Shelly styled Grande for the Critics Choice Awards in a custom Alberta Ferretti gown designed by Lorenzo Serafini.\n\nThe baby-pink gown featured a scooped neckline, a form-fitting bodice, and a floor-length, slightly poofy skirt. A sheer overlay, covered in sparkly embellishments, sat atop the dress and formed a cape in the back.\n\nGrande wore her hair up and paired the statement gown with Swarovski jewelry. The look was the perfect blend of red-carpet glam and an homage to her portrayal of Glinda in \"Wicked: For Good.\"\n\nThe \"Severance\" star's gold-toned gown had a structured bodice with ruching on the center and sides, as well as two diagonal straps that crisscrossed across her upper chest. The texture continued on the full skirt, bringing dimension to the look.\n\nHowever, Arquette added a black belt and black wrap to the look, which felt distracting against the shiny fabric of the dress. The look would have been stronger if she had gone in a different direction with her accessories.\n\nInfiniti, who was nominated for her performance in \"One Battle After Another,\" arrived at the Critics Choice Awards in a yellow set designed by Louis Vuitton.\n\nThe top had a high neckline, while the cropped bodice was rounded with ruched fabric. The back of the top was the same shape but scooped lower, forming a cape that flowed to her calves. A form-fitting skirt with a subtle train matched the top.\n\nInfiniti, who shared on Instagram that the yellow of her outfit is her favorite color, paired the look with diamond jewelry.\n\nJordan selected a burgundy Louis Vuitton suit for the event. The jacket was double-breasted, while the pants were slim-fitted. He paired the bold suit with a pink shirt and a slightly shiny burgundy tie, as well as Christian Louboutin shoes.\n\nThe outfit may have also subtly nodded to \"Sinners,\" for which Jordan was nominated for best actor, as one of the twins he portrays, Stack, wears a similar shade of red throughout the film.\n\nDesigned by Bottega Veneta, Elordi's black suit had a subtly asymmetrical design with the jacket buttoning at an angle. Both the jacket and pants had a relaxed fit, adding to the effortlessly cool feel of the ensemble.\n\nThe \"Frankenstein\" star paired the suit with a black shirt, a gray tie, and black shoes. His sunglasses added a pop of color to the monotone outfit, as they had red lenses.",

    "description": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had a lot to say during his first Manhattan federal court appearance.",
    "fullText": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro defiantly proclaimed his innocence in a Manhattan federal court Monday morning during his and his wife's first public appearance since US forces captured them in a dramatic military raid on Caracas over the weekend.\n\n\"I am innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man. I am still president of my country,\" Maduro told the judge through an interpreter when asked for his plea on narco-terrorism and weapons charges.\n\nHe was then interrupted by the judge, who interjected, \"A not guilty plea will be entered on behalf of Mr. Maduro.\"\n\nIt was one of several dramatic moments during the roughly 30-minute hearing, which Maduro used to protest his capture by US forces.\n\nWhen he entered the courtroom, flanked by US marshals, he wished everyone a \"Happy New Year\" in English and locked eyes with members of the press sitting in the back of the courtroom.\n\nLater, as the hearing wrapped up, a person sitting in the fourth row of the courtroom gallery stood to say Maduro would pay in the name of the Venezuelan people.\n\n\"I am a man of God, and I am a war prisoner,\" Maduro responded in Spanish as US marshals escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nMaduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were arraigned on an indictment alleging a conspiracy to import cocaine and a related conspiracy to possess machine guns and other \"destructive devices\" in furtherance of drug trafficking. Maduro also faces a narco-terrorism conspiracy charge.\n\nThe two wore standard-issue jail garb of navy smocks over orange long-sleeve shirts with khaki pants. At their seats in the courtroom, they wore headphones to listen to their court-appointed translators.\n\nWhen he stood to address the judge, Maduro held on to the arms of his chair as he rose unsteadily. Flores, her blonde hair tied back in a bun, had several small bandages on her face. She sustained injuries during her \"abduction\" in Caracas, one of her attorneys said.\n\nDuring the packed noon hearing, US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein read the couple a summary of their charges and informed the Venezuelan president and first lady of their rights before the pair entered not guilty pleas. He addressed them as \"Mr. Maduro\" and \"Ms. Flores.\"\n\nWhen asked to confirm his identity at the start of the hearing, Maduro began by stating in firmly spoken Spanish that he is \"Presidente constitutional de la Republica Venezuela.\"\n\n\"I am here, kidnapped, since January 3, Saturday,\" Maduro said. I was captured in my home in Caracas, Venezuela.\"\n\n\"There will be a time and place to go into all this,\" the judge interrupted.\n\nAsked for her plea, Flores spoke in a quiet, hoarse voice.\n\n\"Not guilty. Completely innocent,\" she said through a court interpreter.\n\nBoth Maduro and Flores are facing health issues and will need medical attention while awaiting trial, their lawyers said.\n\n\"Miss Flores, during her abduction, sustained significant injuries, as you can see today here in court,\" defense lawyer Mark Donnelly told the judge. \"There's a belief that she may have a fracture or severe bruising on her ribs,\" the lawyer added.\n\nThe 25-page indictment filed against Maduro, his wife, son, and three others alleges that for over 25 years, Venezuelan leaders \"have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States.\"\n\nMaduro was represented in court by Barry Pollack, an attorney best known for also representing WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange. Flores was represented by the Texas-based attorney Mark Donnelly and one of his law partners, Andres Sanchez.\n\nThe attorneys said they would not seek bail for Maduro or Flores on Monday, but reserved the right to seek it at a later date. Pollack told Hellerstein he anticipated \"voluminous and complicated legal practice.\"\n\n\"Mr. Maduro is the head of a sovereign state,\" Pollack said. \"He is entitled to the privileges and immunities that go with that office. In addition, there are issues about the legality of this military abduction.\"\n\nHellerstein scheduled the next court hearing for March 17.\n\nMaduro has long been a target of the US Justice Department. Manhattan federal prosecutors first indicted him in 2020, accusing him of heading the drug-trafficking network, the Cartel de los Soles.\n\nIn 2015, the nephews of Maduro's wife, Flores, were arrested in Haiti and charged with drug trafficking by the same office handling the Maduro case.\n\nThe indictment says Maduro is \"at the forefront of that corruption and has partnered with his co-conspirators to use his illegally obtained authority and the institutions he corroded to transport thousands of tons of cocaine to the United States.\"\n\nOn Saturday, President Donald Trump said the US captured the Venezuelan president following large-scale strikes on the South American nation.\n\nTrump said the US will \"run\" Venezuela until a \"safe, proper, and judicious transition\" can be facilitated. It remains unclear how the Trump administration would carry out this plan and for how long.",

    "title": "I moved from West Virginia to Miami years ago. There are 3 things I love about living in South Florida — but one thing I miss.",
    "description": "After moving from West Virginia to Miami in South Florida a few years ago, I've fallen in love with the great weather and budget travel deals.",
    "fullText": "Throughout my childhood, my family barely strayed from the parts of West Virginia's Appalachia region where I was born and raised.\n\nI spent college two hours away in Ohio, and during those years, I started traveling around the United States and to more distant places in Europe and Latin America.\n\nI love exploring the world, so when it was time to graduate and start a life somewhere new, I applied to jobs all around the country.\n\nI took the first one I could get, and it happened to be in Miami. I'd never been to Florida before, but I quickly found things in Dade County I enjoyed.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of living here, there are three big things I love about living in Miami — and one thing I still miss about West Virginia.\n\nA lot of people have opinions about this one, but as someone who grew up in a colder climate, I much prefer Miami weather.\n\nSummer aside, most weeks are sunny and fairly comfortable with a lot of days between 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Winters are pleasantly short, sunny, and warm.\n\nI also struggle with depression, which can be impacted by the seasons, so having the ability to go outside and get some sunshine any time of the year is a major bonus for me.\n\nThough summertime in Miami can be uncomfortably hot and humid and hurricane season is no joke, I still prefer the weather here to any place that experiences a harsher winter.\n\nAs a travel writer, I'm constantly booking trips and visiting new cities and countries. And when I'm not hopping on a plane or road tripping to a different part of Florida, I can still experience a variety of communities and cultures in Miami.\n\nMost people know Miami for its Cuban influence, but the city is also home to a huge variety of expats from other parts of Latin America, like Colombia, Venezuela and Argentina.\n\nThere's also a lot of diversity from other parts of the world, too. For example, Miami Beach has one of the largest Jewish populations outside of Israel, and there's also a huge variety of Bahamian, Jamaican and other Caribbean cultures here.\n\nMiami is constantly growing and changing, and I love that I can learn about so many different cultures without traveling too far.\n\nOne of my favorite perks of living in Miami truly is how easy and convenient it is to travel from the city.\n\nFor starters, there are two major airports nearby — Miami International Airport (MIA) and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL).\n\nMiami is also the cruise capital of the world, and there are constantly ships sailing from the ports in Miami and Fort Lauderdale.\n\nI'm a budget traveler at heart, and I've scored some incredible travel deals from South Florida. I regularly find flights to Europe for less than $400 from these airports, and I can fly to many places around the US for less than $150.\n\nSince I moved to Florida, I've developed a deep appreciation for the beach. However, I still definitely miss the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nThey're the oldest mountain range in the United States, and these rolling hills are the perfect place for exploring. My favorite time to visit West Virginia is in the late spring or early summer when the trees are at their fullest and brightest.\n\nPalm trees are beautiful, but I definitely miss how serene and peaceful nature can be in West Virginia — especially when compared to how busy and chaotic Miami can feel sometimes.",

    "description": "TheBurntPeanut, a foul-mouthed virtual peanut that plays \"Arc Raiders,\" is wildly popular on Twitch — and estimated to earn over $120,000 a month.",
    "fullText": "A new star has emerged on Twitch: a video game-playing peanut with eyes and lips.\n\nMen across America spent their holiday time off tuning into the hourslong livestreams of TheBurntPeanut. The foul-mouthed legume plays the video game \"Arc Raiders\" while cracking jokes and loving \"goop,\" his term for the virtual loot found in the popular game.\n\nTheBurntPeanut is a VTuber, a type of streamer who conceals their identity using a virtual avatar. There's a long history of these animated gamers, including Twitch giants like Ironmouse.\n\nBut the small animated peanut has grown large in viewership, touting 1.4 million followers on Twitch, 1.1 million on YouTube, and over 750,000 on TikTok.\n\nHere's what you need to know about that peanut your boyfriend, brother, or cousin was raving about over the holidays.\n\nLike many on Twitch, TheBurntPeanut streams for long stretches — often over seven hours at a time — while playing the popular game \"Arc Raiders.\" It's not unusual for 75,000-plus concurrent fans to tune in to watch him dancing, chatting, and cursing out his competitors while gaming.\n\nThe man behind TheBurntPeanut has not yet disclosed his name or appearance. That's a long-standing tradition for some gamers, who often show their screens instead of their own faces, and especially for VTubers. (Think back to 2022, when the YouTuber Dream famously revealed his face.)\n\nTheBurntPeanut does show his actual eyes and lips, which allows him to show emotion. (This should be familiar to any fans of the Annoying Orange.) His peanut body also moves as if it was speaking.\n\nFans of TheBurntPeanut are called \"bungulators\" — and there are a lot of them. According to Stream Charts, TheBurntPeanut was the No. 1 Twitch streamer ranked by hours-watched between December 6 and January 4. In that period, he clocked 9.2 million hours watched on the platform.\n\nMuch of TheBurntPeanut's humor leans on the crass side. He claims that he's been banned from TikTok 47 times. He leans into his character, joking about not having arms and legs, and about eating his family for munching on fries cooked in peanut oil.\n\nAt the December Streamer Awards, TheBurntPeanut took home the prize of Best VTuber, beating industry stalwarts like Ironmouse and Mori Calliope. His win stirred up controversy, as TheBurntPeanut calls himself a \"PTuber\" and does not associate with the traditional, anime-style VTubers that built the category.\n\nVTubers are often cash drivers, with a management industry forming around the streamers. TheBurntPeanut's paid subscribers are split into three tiers: $5.99, $9.99, and $24.99 a month.\n\nStream Charts estimates that TheBurntPeanut counts over 40,000 active subscribers in the first tier, with 84 and 63 active subscribers in the second and third tiers. The firm estimates his 30-day income to be between $129,427 and $201,874.\n\nOn YouTube, fans can support streamers by sending paid \"super chats.\" Playboard estimates that TheBurntPeanut received 985 super chats in the last 7 days, amounting to $12,325.\n\nBefore he became a streamer, TheBurntPeanut said that he worked as a phone salesman. He earned about $600 every two weeks, he said.\n\n\"I've just been so blessed by the Bungulators,\" he said. \"Every day, I wake up, and I thank God that I have what I have.\"\n\nAs TheBurntPeanut's popularity surged in December, so did a spin-off genre of TikTok: complaints and jokes from his fans' partners.\n\nIn one video, a woman said TheBurntPeanut made her boyfriend laugh more than she could. In another, a woman wrote that she sometimes thinks her boyfriend loves TheBurntPeanut more than her.\n\nOne woman recorded herself repeatedly asking why she was \"falling asleep to a peanut.\" She captioned it: \"I am a victim.\"\n\nEnjoy me crashing out over @theburntpeanut because in the past week he’s taken over our household. I’ve woken up to his voice on our bedroom TV at 3am more than once. “His presence is soothing to me” —my fiancé, mid-nap at his own birthday party🎈asleep to burnt peanut 🙃🫠 #boythings #wtf #burntpeanut #christmasparty #holidays\n\nOthers are bonding over TheBurntPeanut. One woman posted about joining her husband to watch the \"little sassy peanut.\" Another wrote that her fiancé got her watching TheBurntPeanut — but that she now watches solo of her own free will.\n\nThe streamers' fans aren't all men, of course. One woman on TikTok described watching TheBurntPeanut as part of her \"night routine.\" The clip now has over 300,000 views. One family rang in the New Year watching TheBurntPeanut on their television.\n\nThese TikToks are a sign of how pervasive one small peanut has become — and how meteoric his rise has been. So if you see a peanut on the TV when you enter a restaurant, now you know why.",

    "fullText": "A photo of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in US custody may have turned him into an accidental fashion influencer.\n\nWhen US President Donald Trump posted a photo of Maduro on January 3 after he was captured by US forces, internet sleuths quickly identified the outfit — and haven't stopped talking about it since. Maduro appears to be wearing a gray Nike Tech fleece set in the picture.\n\nFollowing the January 3 post, searches for \"Nike Tech\" on Google spiked, according to Google Trends.\n\nThe online conversations about the athleisure line also surged dramatically on X, intelligence platform PeakMetrics told Business Insider. Nike Tech was mentioned in over 5,000 X posts a day between January 3 and January 5, according to PeakMetrics. That's up from the roughly 325 posts a day it averaged from November 1 to December 31.\n\nOn TikTok, users posted AI-generated versions of the photo and poked fun at the fashion choice. Some users joked that it was a new Nike campaign. Others made \"steal the look\" posts that broke down the cost of the full outfit, including the darkened eye mask and ear covering. The jacket and joggers cost over $200 combined.\n\nVENEZUELAN PRESIDENT PUT IN NIKE TECH,SHIPPED TO NEW YORKI #venezuela #president #fyp #news #update\n\nAs of Monday morning, the style of the Nike Tech fleece zip-up jacket that Maduro was photographed in was sold out on Nike's US website in several sizes.\n\nThe fleece jacket already appeared to be a hot item before Maduro donned it on the Navy ship USS Iwo Jima. It appeared to be partially sold out in November and December, according to screenshots archived on Wayback Machine.\n\nIt's been the subject of a viral debate in recent weeks, with some young men bragging on social media about being \"team Nike Tech\" or \"team quarter-zip\" to show whether they're a part of Corporate America or not.\n\nSome members of Gen Z and Gen Alpha also had their eyes on Nike Tech for the holidays. A clip of a girl opening her Christmas gift, a Nike Tech set, garnered over 1 million likes on TikTok and earned a comment from Nike itself.\n\nNike also made its way onto teens' wish lists this year, and it dominated Piper Sandler's semi-annual teen survey as the No. 1 clothing brand in fall 2025.\n\nMaduro, the longtime Venezuelan leader, and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured in an overnight raid in Caracas over the weekend and taken to the US, where Maduro faces federal charges.",

I didn‘t feel it was a comeback, actually,” Trump shot back, apparently offended by Graham forgetting that the 2020 election, by his account, was “rigged.”\n\nThe South Carolina Republican was quick to move the conversation on.\n\n“The bottom line is, we have a drug caliphate in our backyard,” Graham said.\n\nThe exchange took place as the president traveled back to the White House from his resort in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, where he’s understood to have watched a livestream of Saturday night’s capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nGraham had already sung Trump’s praises over that seizure, decried by critics as an illegal assault on the rules-based international order, during a Fox News appearance late Sunday.\n\n“The military operation in Venezuela showed America at her best, all thanks to our incredible men and women in uniform,” the senator wrote in an X post, sharing a clip from that interview. “Maduro miscalculated our Commander in Chief, and President [Donald Trump] made clear he will not be trifled with.”",

    "description": "US stocks, gold, and bitcoin pushed past the latest geopolitical turmoil on Monday. Conflicts over the years have been mostly shrugged off by investors.",
    "fullText": "A new geopolitical conflict is unfolding. Yet, US stocks are… up at new record highs?\n\nThat's the dynamic on display on Monday as investors digest the US's raid on Venezuela and the capture of the nation's president, Nicolás Maduro, over the weekend.\n\nDespite the upheaval of its South American neighbor, US stocks, gold, and bitcoin were among risk assets that churned higher on Monday. As far as markets are concerned, the Venezuela situation seems to already be an afterthought.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed 0.6%, while the Dow's 1.3% jump notched a record closing high for the benchmark. Energy stocks led the way across both indexes.\n\nThose moves seem counterintuitive, but they reflect a dynamic that markets have shown time and time again over the decades: investors simply don't care that much about conflict abroad.\n\nStocks, for one, have a pattern of falling as geopolitical tensions rise, but rebounding once the conflict actually occurs. According to an analysis by Fundstrat Research, there are at least five instances where equities rallied after a major geopolitical event, such as the first Gulf War or when Hamas attacked Israel in 2023.\n\n\"The old adage has long been to 'sell the rumor, buy the invasion,'\" Kent Fung, Fundstrat's vice president of market intelligence, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nPeter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, said Monday's rally showed investors are more focused on taking the weekend's string of events in a \"positive light.\"\n\n\"You had a country that has been hostile to the US that has expropriated a lot of US investments, and now Trump has orchestrated a regime shift that could open the country up for new investment,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe lack of a negative reaction in markets could also reflect how investors can't yet price in a final outcome of the US-Venezuela conflict. The market also seems to be focused on other recent stock drivers, such as the rally broadening out to sectors beyond tech, Berezin said.\n\nThe market's upward momentum is proving to be a tough force to stop. US equities notched another record-setting year in 2025, with the S&P 500 gaining 16% as investors remained laser-focused on the growth potential of AI, strong earnings, rate cuts, and a still-resilient US economy.\n\n\"Solid results almost across the board\" last year have caused investor confidence to be \"reasonably strong,\" Nicholas Colas, the co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note on Monday.\n\n\"From a mechanical standpoint, the global macro backdrop looks essentially unchanged,\" Karl Schamotta, the chief market strategist at Corpay, wrote in a note detailing how investors largely took the Venezuela situation \"in stride.\"\n\nIf anything, investors are more likely to care about the coming December jobs report, Schamotta added, which could influence the market's expectations for interest rate cuts in 2026.",

    "description": "As a Pilates instructor of 13 years, I see many first-time students make the same mistakes, from wearing the wrong clothes to not eating before class.",
    "fullText": "I became a Pilates instructor 13 years ago after reformer classes helped me recover from a severe back injury.\n\nNowadays, I teach 20 group equipment classes weekly and see about 100 clients over seven days. With that many students, it's no surprise I see new clients make the same mistakes over and over.\n\nHere are the five most common mistakes I see students make during their first few Pilates classes.\n\nI recommend new clients arrive at the studio at least 10 minutes before class so that I have time to fit them into the equipment.\n\nFor example, the Reformer carriage must be adjusted to fit their unique body type, height, and overall proportions. I also ensure the straps are even and at the correct length for the client.\n\nArriving ahead of schedule allows students to get settled and stay focused during class.\n\nPilates classes involve verbal cueing, which means most teachers will describe the exercises instead of demonstrating them. However, following oral instructions can be particularly challenging for non-auditory learners.\n\nFor example, when doing reformer Pilates classes, the springs can be adjusted to increase or decrease resistance. Many first-timers attend Pilates classes with a gym mindset, assuming heavier loads produce the best results.\n\nHowever, when taking a class, you should never ignore the instructor's directions on how much resistance to use. Following directions is essential for staying safe and seeing results.\n\nPilates uses a technique known as lateral breathing to stabilize the trunk (chest, abdomen, pelvis, and back) while you move. This helps prevent unwanted pelvis movement or an arched back.\n\nGood form during exercise allows for proper muscle recruitment and helps prevent injuries, which is why I always remind my students to be mindful of their breath.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that engaging your core and developing breathing techniques takes time. When in doubt, stick to your usual breathing pattern.\n\nMost studios require clients to wear socks with proper grips on the bottom for safety and hygiene purposes.\n\nYour feet may get slippery during movements requiring extra stability, so I recommend wearing them even if the studio doesn't mandate it.\n\nIt's also important to avoid wearing loose-fitting clothing so the instructor can see your body and help you make the proper adjustments.\n\nAdditionally, it's best to keep long hair in a bun so it doesn't get caught in the springs or other parts of the equipment.\n\nTaking a Pilates class on an empty stomach is a big no-no. However, you also don't want to feel too full before class since Pilates is a core-centered workout.\n\nI recommend eating something light an hour before class. A protein shake or a rice cake with peanut butter are good options if you're taking an early class.\n\nFor those who prefer to exercise on their lunch break, a small salad with light protein will do the trick. The most important thing, however, is to listen to your body and find what works for you.\n\nThis story was originally published on August 28, 2024, and most recently updated on January 5, 2025.",

    "title": "This Is How Long It Takes to Recover From the ‘Super Flu,’ According to Doctors",
    "description": "The flu is a serious illness, and recovery can take time.",
    "fullText": "It’s one thing to hear about cases of the so-called “super flu” skyrocketing in the country, but it’s another to actually deal with it. If you’ve recently experienced the flu, you may be wondering when you’ll feel like yourself again. Unfortunately, doctors say it can take time.\n\nThe flu can cause uncomfortable symptoms like fever, cough, and sore throat when you’re initially sick, but you may also be sidelined with lingering fatigue and generally feeling off after your original symptoms have cleared. “Once influenza grabs you, it can hold onto you for a longer period of time than the acute illness,” William Schaffner, MD, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tells SELF.\n\nOkay, but why? And, ballpark, how long are we talking about here? This is how long it takes to recover from the “super flu,” according to doctors, plus what you can do to speed up your recovery.\n\nThe flu has always been a potentially serious illness. But the strain of the flu that’s circulating right now—which is called subclade K—is a strong version of the virus that is better at evading the previous immunity you might have, whether it’s from the flu vaccine or having had other versions of the flu. As a result, more people are vulnerable to getting infected and feeling horrible for longer than usual when they get sick.\n\nIt’s too early to have data on how long most people are sick with subclade K, but Dr. Schaffner says he’s heard anecdotes of this strain causing illness that lasts longer than your typical flu. “The dominant strain out there is part of the H3N2 family, and that usually causes more severe illness,” he says.\n\nIt’s tough for doctors to say exactly how long it will take for you to feel better when you have the flu, given that things like your individual immune response and underlying health conditions come into play. But there is a ballpark that you can expect.\n\n“While the acute symptoms such as fever might abate in a few days, fatigue and [feeling off] may persist for a week or longer,” Amesh A. Adalja, MD, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells SELF. There are a few reasons for this. “The virus sets up an inflammatory response—that’s how the body fights off the virus,” Dr. Schaffner says. But after the initial illness starts to fade, that inflammation can keep going and continue to fuel symptoms like a sore throat, dry cough, and just generally feeling lousy, he says. “That undoubtedly can last for a while,” Dr. Schaffner says.\n\nBeing dehydrated and moving less than usual (because you’re not feeling great) can also slow down the recovery process, Dr. Adalja says. There’s even something called long influenza syndrome that some people experience, he points out. (Think long COVID, but with the flu.)\n\nEven though early data suggests that this year’s flu vaccine isn’t as effective at preventing the flu, Dr. Adalja says that being vaccinated is likely to help you recover faster.\n\nIf you didn’t get your flu shot, there’s no reason to harp on it—that won’t help you now. But regardless of your vaccination status, doctors say there are a few things you can do to try to speed up your recovery time or at least feel better while you ride things out.\n\nThe first is to ask your healthcare provider about taking an antiviral treatment like oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza). “If you start an antiviral early, it reduces the severity of the illness,” Dr. Schaffner says.\n\nThere is a caveat to keep in mind that your healthcare provider may flag: Oseltamivir can cause “fairly prominent” side effects like nausea and vomiting, Dr. Schaffner says. “Pediatricians are a little more careful about that,” he says. “But for people in high-risk groups for severe disease, including older persons, those who are immune compromised, and those who are pregnant, we unhesitantly recommend using the medication.”\n\nBeyond that, both doctors agree that staying well hydrated is crucial. “Make sure you keep up with your fluids,” Dr. Schaffner says. “If you let yourself get dehydrated, you’re more likely to get pneumonia.” Not only that, being well hydrated will keep your mucus membranes moist and make it easier to get out nasal discharge, making you feel less stuffy, Dr. Schaffner says.\n\nWhile Dr. Adalja says you don’t want to overexert yourself when you’re in the initial phase of being sick, moving once you’re in the recovery phase is important. “Sit up, walk around, and start moving as much as possible,” Dr. Schaffner says. “Your body will appreciate that.” At the same time, he stresses the importance of getting a good night’s sleep to give your body plenty of opportunity to rest and recover.\n\nBut while you’re doing all of that, it’s important to keep flu complications like pneumonia on the back burner. “If a person has unremitting fever, shortness of breath, or extreme fatigue that prohibits them from performing their activities of daily living, they should see a medical provider,” Dr. Adalja says. (Dr. Schaffner also recommends being on the lookout for yellow or green phlegm—this can be a sign of pneumonia too.)\n\n“If you’re more than a week out from the acute illness and you’re not getting better or even feeling worse, it’s time to contact your doctor,” Dr. Schaffner says. But if you feel like you’re getting better—just at a slower pace than you’d hope—he recommends being patient. The flu is a serious illness, and recovery can take time.\n\nThis Year’s Flu Is Different.

    "fullText": "A hapless Donald Trump made a show of the Air Force One stairs as he stepped off the presidential jet after a two-week stay at his Mar-a-Lago bolthole.\n\nTrump arrived in Palm Beach County early on Dec. 20 for a 15-day stay and returned to Washington, D.C., via an airbase in Maryland on Sunday evening. But as he descended the steps of AF1 to board Marine One for his onward journey, several possible tell-tale signs of weakness became apparent.\n\nThe Daily Beast has dutifully reported on the waning physical power of the 79-year-old president, with major players such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal joining the conversation later. Trump admitted to the latter that he has sought medical help for a myriad of issues.\n\nIn that unusually candid interview last week, he conceded that he visited Walter Reed Military Medical Center in mid-July after suffering “mild swelling” in his lower legs and said an ultrasound showed he has “chronic venous insufficiency,” a common ailment in older people that makes it more difficult for the blood to travel to the heart from the legs through smaller veins.\n\nThis, perhaps, contributed to Trump making the relatively simple task of walking down some steps and then in a straight line, and then up some even smaller steps, look like a gargantuan effort.\n\nTV footage captured the charade. Trump is seen emerging from the door of the jet before gripping the handrail and appearing to let his legs drop abruptly onto the steps. He gingerly descends before pawing for a second handrail as his eyes remain fixed on the red carpet in front of him.\n\nHis hair comedically flaps in the wind as he takes on the second portion of the stairs, even slower than the first. He steps out onto the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews and takes a breather, saluting the gathered officials and waving to the press.\n\nHe then embarks on a long arc towards Marine One, where he veers wildly to the left of the door, stopping for chats along the way. The short walk, in which he also drags his right leg, takes what feels like an age. He appears jaded as he ascends the tiny staircase into the chopper, which brought him back to the White House.\n\nTrump has made a hash of the AF1 steps plenty of times in the past and more frequently of late. In a video showing such an instance from just before Christmas, Trump appears at the aircraft door and slaps his right leg three times with his right hand before heading down the stairs cautiously.\n\nJust before the New Year, his old foe—steps—appeared to rankle him once more. The president cautiously climbed down the steps at the main entrance of his Mar-a-Lago estate as he welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the Gaza peace plan.\n\nTrump glanced down at the short staircase before him as he waited for Netanyahu to come forward.\n\nTrump hasn’t been coy about his fear of stairs. In September, he admitted that he was wary of publicly stumbling and falling like his predecessor Joe Biden, who was 82 when he left the White House.\n\n“Every day, the guy’s falling down stairs,” Trump told military generals who were gathered in Quantico. “I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs—like I’m on stairs, like these stairs—I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record. Just try not to fall because it doesn’t work out well... Just walk nice and easy. You don’t have to set any record.”",

    "description": "Small drones are \"the defining threat of our time,\" Brig. Gen. Ross said, requiring a layered defense network to stop them.",
    "fullText": "The US military is racing to develop better defenses against drones, but there's no silver bullet, no wonder weapon, that will single-handedly defeat everything, the commander of the Pentagon's new counter-drone force said.\n\nJoint Interagency Task Force 401 says stopping drones isn't about one weapon or system. The counter-drone fight will require a mix of different tools, from ways to physically shoot down drones to electronic and other non-kinetic solutions.\n\nIt also demands easier, faster processes for testing and buying systems across the services.\n\nThe task force was created last fall to expedite counter-drone technologies across the Department of Defense, replacing the Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office, which was established in 2019. Since its establishment, the task force has assessed and contributed to the US military's counter-drone arsenal, including forces at home and abroad.\n\nBut there's no one system they've found that can stop small uncrewed aerial systems, or UAS, which the task force's commander, Brig. Gen. Matt Ross, called \"the defining threat of our time.\"\n\n\"There's no silver bullet for counter-UAS. There's just not,\" Ross said last month at a media roundtable. \"If there was, we would already have it,\" he added.\n\nInstead, the task force is focused on a suite of technologies for layered, integrated protection from drones. \"Our formations must be able to detect, track, identify, and defeat these systems anywhere on the planet,\" Ross said. \"This requires us to layer our defenses by integrating sensors with kinetic and non-kinetic effectors and battle management systems into a responsive, interoperable network.\"\n\nHe said that many defense technologies already exist for countering medium-sized drones, which the Pentagon classifies as Group 3, but more work remains in smaller drones under Group 1 and 2, UAS such as the quadcopters that dominate in Ukraine.\n\nAnd the counter-drone problem isn't just about what systems are needed to protect service members and civilians. \"The technology is not going to solve this problem for us. We can't field a system that will stop every drone. It will all come down to the installation commander or the person responsible for that site and how they use the tools that we provide them,\" Ross said.\n\nIn its first 100 days, the task force has identified a key goal: creating a shared command-and-control system that makes it easier for different teams and regions to share data. It also wants to build a marketplace where the military services, law enforcement, and other agencies can find counter-drone systems suited to their specific threats, review performance data and user feedback, and potentially buy those systems in one place.\n\nThe task force notably isn't operating in isolation. There's overlap between the task force's focus on stopping Group 3 drones, systems like Shield AI's V-BAT or the Army's AAI RQ-7, and the responsibilities of the Golden Dome missile defense project, which has to include defenses for Group 3 drones.\n\nThe task force plans to share data with the Golden Dome project, and Ross said he's currently discussing what that looks like with Space Force's Gen. Michael Guetlein.\n\nAnother priority for the task force is helping protect against small drones at major events, including the FIFA World Cup this year, with matches set to be held at 11 large stadiums in cities across the US.\n\nRoss said that based on US forces overseas, \"we're heavily indexed against Group 3 systems, and those are larger systems that fly a longer distance and carry heavier payloads. And I want to make sure that we have just as robust protection against Group 1 and Group 2 systems that are smaller and much more likely to be seen over a widely attended gathering, stadium, or a watch party specifically for the World Cup.\"",

    "title": "Meet Barry Pollack, Nicolás Maduro's lawyer who also represented Julian Assange",
    "description": "Barry Pollack has a long track record of sensitive cases involving national security, and of defending corporate executives in criminal trials.",
    "fullText": "When Nicolás Maduro needed someone to represent him in an American courtroom, he turned to a lawyer with experience facing off against the federal government.\n\nThe Venezuelan political leader hired Barry Pollack, a criminal defense attorney who's represented WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange, as well as other high-profile defendants.\n\nThe Justice Department has accused Maduro, who was serving as Venezuela's president when he was captured by US forces, of participating in a narco-terrorism conspiracy, alleging he worked with illegal drug gangs. They also accused him and his wife, Cilia Flores, of conspiring to illegally import cocaine into the United States and of gun-related charges.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, US Marshals escorted the couple into a 26th-floor courtroom in lower Manhattan, where they entered not-guilty pleas and proclaimed their innocence. US military forces apprehended Maduro and Flores in a pre-dawn operation on Saturday in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas and brought them to the United States.\n\nAt the hearing, Pollack told US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein that he would file \"voluminous and complicated\" motions on Maduro's behalf, suggesting he would challenge the charges and the basis for his arrest.\n\n\"Mr. Maduro is the head of a sovereign state,\" Pollack said in court. \"He is entitled to the privileges and immunities that go with that office. In addition, there are issues about the legality of this military abduction.\"\n\nDelcy Rodriguez was sworn in as Venezuela's interim president on Monday afternoon.\n\nPollack, an attorney at the boutique law firm Harris St. Laurent & Wechsler LLP, is best known as one of the many lawyers who represented Assange, the publisher of WikiLeaks.\n\nProsecutors had accused Assange of working with hackers to obtain government secrets from federal agencies and American companies, as well as conspiring with former US Army officer Chelsea Manning to leak documents about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\nAssange pleaded guilty to espionage charges in the summer of 2024, capping a six-year legal battle that involved complex negotiations with multiple governments.\n\nPollack's experience with sensitive national security matters could be an asset for his representation of Maduro, which will likely involve classified information. The attorney has also represented Jeffrey Sterling, a former CIA officer who was convicted of espionage charges after leaking information to a journalist.\n\nTo be paid, Pollack will likely need a waiver from the US Treasury Department, which has sanctioned Maduro and the Venezuelan government.\n\nIt's not clear when Pollack began representing Maduro. He formally entered an appearance on the court docket late Monday morning. Maduro was first indicted in 2020, and Hellerstein has overseen court proceedings against other Venezuelan nationals accused of conspiring with him. Pollack didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nA court-appointed lawyer for Maduro, David Wikstrom, told Business Insider he was informed at 8:40 a.m. on Monday that he would be representing the Venezuelan president in court. Shortly before the noon court hearing, he said he still hadn't spoken to Pollack, who ultimately represented Maduro in the proceeding.\n\nFlores is represented by Mark Donnelly, a Texas-based attorney who served as a federal prosecutor for 12 years, and one of his law partners, Andres Sanchez.\n\nPollack, a former public defender and president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, has a long track record of successful defense outcomes in criminal trials.\n\nHe represented former Enron accountant Michael W. Krautz, who a jury acquitted of fraud charges. And he successfully overturned the conviction of Martin Tankleff, a Long Island man who spent 17 years in prison after he was falsely accused of killing his parents as a teenager.\n\nMore recently, Pollack represented the executive of a poultry company accused of conspiring to fix the price of chickens. Jurors declined to find the executive guilty in two separate trials.\n\nIn a 2025 interview with Lawdragon, Pollack decried the Justice Department's \"extraordinary view\" of its jurisdiction for criminal cases, using the Assange case as an example.\n\n\"You've got somebody who's not a United States citizen who is publishing information not in the United States, had not set foot in the United States, with respect to any of the alleged offensive conduct,\" Pollack said. \"The information was leaked to him by somebody in Iraq. Yet the United States obviously felt that it could pursue that as a criminal offense in the United States.\"",

    "fullText": "Children are growing up as AI natives and experts say computing skills should be on par with reading and writing\n\nIn a Cambridge classroom, Joseph, 10, trained his AI model to discern between drawings of apples and drawings of smiles.\n\n“AI gets lots of things wrong,” he said, as it mistakenly identified a fruit as a face. He set about retraining it and, in a flash, he had it back on track – instinctively understanding the inner nature of artificial intelligence and machine learning in a way few adults do.\n\nHis friends from the St Paul’s C of E primary school coding club tapped away to build their own AIs with similar dexterity. Just as people born in the early 20th century never knew a world without manned flight, and generation Z has always lived with social media, Joseph and his friends are AI natives.\n\nHere, on one December morning, some of them were being taught the principles and practicalities of the potentially world-changing technology that experts fear may pass large numbers of people by and leave them disempowered.\n\nPhilip Colligan, the chief executive of the digital education charity the Raspberry Pi Foundation, has warned of a “big split” in society between people who grasp how AIs work and are able to control them – challenging their increasing role in automating decisions in areas including housing, welfare, health, criminal justice and finance. On the other hand, there could be a cadre of AI illiterates who risk social disempowerment.\n\nColligan, a leading expert in technology and its social impacts, told the Guardian AI literacy must become a universal part of education on a par with reading and writing to avoid a social divide opening up.\n\n“There is a world where you’ve got a big split between kids who understand, have that core knowledge and therefore are able to assert themselves and those who don’t,” said Colligan, whose charity is affiliated to the £600m British low-cost tech hardware startup of the same name. “And that could be really very dangerous.”\n\nHis warning was backed by Simon Peyton Jones, a computer researcher who led the creation of the schools national curriculum for computing in 2014, prior to the AI boom. He called for a new digital literacy qualification for all schoolchildren that would ensure they know how to use AIs in a critical way.\n\n“If it’s simply a black box, then [its actions] seem like magic,” he said. “If you know nothing about how the magic is working that is terribly disabling. I am very worried about students leaving school without having agency in the world.”\n\nTheir comments came amid a fall in the number of children studying computing, with 2025 entries for a GCSE in the subject down across the UK. Today, three times more people take history and nearly double the number take biology, chemistry and physics. At the same time, use of AI systems nationwide has been surging – up 78% in the year to September, according to polling by Ipsos.\n\nPart of the belief that learning computing skills is becoming redundant comes from some of the big AI companies, which argue their systems are going to automate coding. Anthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, said in October that 90% of its own coding was automated using its Claude AI model. Meanwhile, 2025 was the year when “vibe coding” became a common phrase – capturing the idea that AIs would allow humans to build software by using natural language instructions rather than specialised code.\n\nPolitical leaders such as Keir Starmer have also suggested coding is becoming redundant. As leader of the opposition in 2023, he said: “The old way – learning out-of-date IT, on 20-year-old computers – doesn’t work. But neither does the new fashion, that every kid should be a coder, when artificial intelligence will blow that future away.” It has created the idea that understanding the inner workings of a computer may be less relevant in the future.\n\n“I think they’re just overhyping the benefits,” said Colligan, whose charity works in schools across dozens of countries.\n\n“This message is leaking out that the kids don’t need to learn this stuff any more and that is not only flawed it is dangerous. We’re already talking to teachers in lots and lots of schools around the world, not just the UK, saying: ‘We can drop computer science now, right?’ That’s a problem.”\n\nHe added: “All of us are going into a world where more and more of the decisions we encounter every day will be taken by automated systems. At the moment it’s what movie should I watch next or what song should I listen to? Fairly soon it’s going to be finance decisions, healthcare decisions, criminal justice decisions. If you don’t understand how those decisions are being made by automated systems, you can’t advocate for your rights. You can’t challenge them, you can’t critically evaluate what’s being presented to you.”\n\nIn December, the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who is now an AI investor, predicted that “we will move from staring at the internet, to living in the internet”.\n\nColligan said: “My concern is there will be a gap between kids based on their socioeconomic background. Some kids who go to great schools, who are able to teach this stuff, will be in a much stronger position as citizens, whether or not they’re using technology for their job. Those kids who are in communities where they don’t have access to [AI literacy teaching] will be passively on the end of a whole load of automated decisions.”\n\nIn the coding club, the seven- to 10-year-olds are taught how AIs work. The lessons were clearly having an effect on Joseph. He said he thought AI “will probably be good, but if lots of people believe it when it’s wrong it will have a bad impact on them”.\n\nHe was not interested in letting the AI do the coding of the video games he planned to make. “It might do it differently to what you want,” he said. “It might also do it wrong and you need to know how to solve it … I’d like to be in charge of the AI. If the AI is in charge of us, we wouldn’t really be able to control what we’re doing and that would be bad.”",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS — Nvidia (NVDA) is touting its latest robotics advancements at CES 2026 as the broader tech industry begins a large-scale effort to bring humanoid robots to life.\n\nDuring the company's keynote on Monday, CEO Jensen Huang revealed that firms ranging from Boston Dynamics and Caterpillar (CAT) to LG Electronics and NEURA Robotics are using Nvidia's robotics technologies to develop and power their various bots.\n\nNvidia has claimed that physical AI could revolutionize the $50 trillion manufacturing and logistics industries, and the company wants to be at the center of it all.\n\nDuring CES, Nvidia revealed a variety of new AI models to help train robots to interact with the world around them, as well as the hardware necessary to power their digital brains.\n\nIn addition to humanoid bots, Nvidia showed off a new family of models for self-driving cars called Alpamayo. According to the company, Alpamayo uses a chain-of-thought reasoning-based vision language action (VLA) model.\n\nThat's a lot to take in, but essentially the models can recognize unique driving situations that might not otherwise happen during a regular drive and come up with the proper way to move forward.\n\nFor instance, the model could see that a traffic light is out when a vehicle is approaching an intersection, recognize the problem, and try to figure out what to do next.\n\nNvidia said the models are meant to serve as \"large-scale teacher models that developers can fine-tune and distill into the backbones of their complete [self-driving] stacks.\"\n\nIn other words, Alpamayo is meant to help developers improve their self-driving vehicle technologies over time.\n\nNvidia said companies including Lucid (LCID), Uber (UBER), and Berkeley DeepDrive have shown interest in Alpamayo.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles are hitting roads around the world, with Google's Waymo leading the way, but they're still not perfect. Some cars have caused traffic jams and have gotten confused in certain situations.\n\nNvidia sees virtual training as a helpful solution for the continued development of the technology, allowing developers to teach their AI models without having to necessarily put cars on the road at all times.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

    "title": "There’s Compelling Evidence That Someone Connected to the Trump Administration Profited Off the Invasion of Venezuela by Placing Large Bets on Polymarket",
    "description": "\"Pete Hegseth making some beer money on the side?\"",
    "fullText": "Prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi have long garnered a reputation for facilitating cheating and insider trading — allowing an athlete, for instance, to place a bet on a game they could then lose on purpose.\n\nNow there’s compelling evidence that someone with inside information about the Trump administration’s regime change plans in Venezuela used that foreknowledge to profit massively from the conflict.\n\nAs spotted by researcher Tyson Brody, an unidentified user bet tens of thousands of dollars on various predictions that Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro would be imminently “out” or that the US forces would show up “in Venezuela by” a specified date during the runup to the incursion.\n\nThe account “existed for only one week and quickly became the biggest ‘yes’ holder in the Maduro out market,” Brody tweeted.\n\nThe evidence of insider trading is compelling, to say the least, given the highly suspicious timing. The account invested over $30,000 less than two days before the United States launched its invasion to kidnap Maduro and his wife and “profited $400,000 in less than 24 hours,” as sports entrepreneur Joe Pompliano calculated in a post on Bluesky.\n\n“Seems pretty suspicious!” he added. “[Secretary of defense] Pete Hegseth making some beer money on the side?” Brody joked.\n\n“Insider trading is not only allowed on prediction markets; it’s encouraged,” Pompliano argued.\n\nWho was behind the Polymarket account remains a mystery. Accounts on markets like Polymarket are anonymous, and payouts are in cryptocurrency, making them hard to track.\n\nAs Semafor reported over the weekend, news organizations also had early intel of the US raid on Venezuela, but held off publishing the information so as not to put US troops in danger.\n\nIn other words, could it have been an insider at a New York or Washington newsroom who was trying to make a buck — or was it an operative inside the Trump administration?\n\nPrediction markets have long raised concerns over exactly these types of situations. Case in point, one Polymarket user made $1 million in 24 hours in early December after betting on Google’s 2025 Year in Search rankings. Per Forbes, the account had a “near-perfect record of 22 correct predictions out of 23 attempts.”\n\nAs The American Prospect points out, critics of the Trump administration have long accused officials of dabbling in similar behavior. The administration has also allowed the prediction market to flourish by dropping enforcement cases in the crypto world and failing to introduce meaningful regulations.\n\nEven Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), which owns the president’s social network, Truth Social, entered the prediction markets business last year, showing a pointed appetite for the space.\n\n“Of course insiders shouldn’t be able to get rich off of policy decisions — but even more concerning is the possibility that people are skewing policy outcomes in order to make their bets pay off,” Demand Progress executive director Sean Vitka told The American Prospect.\n\nOne thing’s for sure: while insiders profit, those without that privileged information lose out — and when the bets are on a deadly conflict, innocent people stand to suffer as well.\n\n“And questions related to whether or not, and when, military action might be undertaken are especially vulnerable to such manipulation because the president frequently moves with discretion over the timing and (legally or not) without notice to the public or Congress,” Vitka added.\n\nMore on Polymarket: New App Lets Users Bet on Deadly Conflicts in Real Time",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump is fretting that the Supreme Court will shoot down his signature tariffs initiative and declare it illegal.\n\nIn a panicked Truth Social post, the 79-year-old pushed the false claim that his tariffs generated $600 billion for the U.S. while suggesting there is a media blackout on their dubious benefits.\n\n“We have taken in, and will soon be receiving, more than 600 Billion Dollars in Tariffs, but the Fake News Media refuses to talk about it because they hate and disrespect our Country, and want to interfere with the upcoming Tariff decision, one of the most important ever, of the United States Supreme Court,” Trump wrote. “Because of Tariffs, our Country is financially, AND FROM A NATIONAL SECURITY STANDPOINT, FAR STRONGER AND MORE RESPECTED THAN EVER BEFORE. GOD BLESS AMERICA!”\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule in the coming weeks on whether to overturn a previous ruling that declared most of Trump’s sweeping global tariffs illegal.\n\nA lower federal appeals court found in August that the president had overstepped his authority when he cited a 1977 law—the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which is designed to address threats during a national emergency—to justify his reciprocal tariffs.\n\nWhile the conservative-majority Supreme Court, including three justices nominated by Trump, has largely ruled in the president’s favor in past cases, there are growing indications that the court may not back him this time and could strike down the tariffs.\n\nDuring a hearing in November, Trump-appointed Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts, appeared skeptical of the president’s reasoning for imposing the tariffs.\n\nIf SCOTUS were to rule against Trump, it would not only be a major embarrassment for the president but could also trigger further economic turmoil, as countries may need to be reimbursed for the billions of dollars of funds collected under Trump’s tariff plans.\n\nTrump has posted multiple fear-mongering messages on Truth Social since the Supreme Court began hearing arguments in the case last year.\n\n“The U.S. Supreme Court was given the wrong numbers. The ‘unwind’ in the event of a negative decision on Tariffs would be, including investments made, to be made, and return of funds, in excess of 3 Trillion Dollars,” Trump wrote in a late-night November post. “It would not be possible to ever make up for that kind of a ‘drubbing.’”\n\nIn another desperate message on January 2, Trump added: “Tariffs are an overwhelming benefit to our Nation, as they have been incredible for our National Security and Prosperity (like nobody has ever seen before!). Losing our ability to Tariff other countries who treat us unfairly would be a terrible blow to the United States of America.”",

As family members await answers about what happened, they're speaking out about the couple's final moments.\n\nChristine Sauvé, 55, and Alain Noël, 56, both of Québec, were found dead by their son in their vacation home located in the El Indio Village residential complex in Villa Riva on Friday, Dec. 26, her brother, Gilles Sauvé Jr., confirms to PEOPLE.\n\nAutopsies have already been performed and Gilles says the family's been told they can expect initial results later this week, but that a final report could take up to 4 months.\n\nWithout any definitive answers just yet, there's been lots of speculation in the local press, including questions about whether the couple were murdered or died by suicide. But, Gilles believes \"that is not true.\"\n\nChristine and Alain were married for over 30 years and raised two kids — Jonathan, 30, and Sabrina, 28 — Gilles says, describing the couple as good people with lots of friends.\n\n\"Alain was a big man but a really big teddy bear. And Christine was amazing,\" her brother says. \"She liked to do a lot of things for the family.”\n\nChristine and Alain arrived in the Dominican Republic — where they got a house they planned to live in after retiring — along with their son Jonathan on Dec. 14 for the start of a month-long vacation.\n\nWhile overseas, Gilles says that Christine began experiencing dizziness and had a fall, which prompted her to go to a hospital on Dec. 25, where she had her blood work done. When she went home later that day, she was not given any prescription for her symptoms, but was told to come back the following day for some scans.\n\nGilles says that Alain had also experienced a little dizziness, but was so caught up in worry about his wife's health that he didn't end up mentioning it to doctors.\n\nAfter coming back from the hospital, the couple FaceTimed their family back in Canada. Gilles says they both appeared to be a \"little bit exhausted,\" but didn't report feeling dizzy at the time.\n\nDuring the conversation, Christine mentioned having no clue what caused the dizziness. She wondered if it might have anything to do with her ongoing health issues — they both had high blood pressure and diabetes — although she couldn't say for sure.\n\n\"It was not clear,\" Gilles says. \"There was nothing really clear about it.\"\n\nAdditionally, they both mentioned having a bit of a \"stomach problem,\" but didn't think they'd eaten any food that upset them.\n\nMostly, they were \"very tired and exhausted,\" but otherwise fine during the call, according to Gilles.\n\n\"Alain showed me his house outside because he did some new little garden things and put lights on and,\" he says, adding that his sister was also \"looking and talking\" well.\n\nThe next morning, when Jonathan woke up around 9:30 a.m., he noticed his parents hadn’t gotten up yet, which was odd because Alain, who worked in the family construction business, was usually an early riser.\n\nGilles says Jonathan brushed it off at the time, thinking they'd slept in because they'd been so tired the night before. However, when they still hadn't woken up an hour later, he went into their room and found them unresponsive in bed.\n\nThe first thing that Jonathan did, says Gilles, was call his sister Sabrina and tell her that their parents were not breathing. Sabrina then told her brother to call the resort manager-owner, who proceeded to contact local authorities.\n\n“Everybody came and they did what they had to do and they searched the house,” Gilles says.\n\nGilles and Sabrina arrived in the Dominican Republic about a day and a half later to be with Jonathan and help communicate with Dominican authorities, which have been difficult due to the language barrier.\n\nCanadian officials reached out to the family four days later to give them the phone number of the funeral home, which they'd already reached out to.\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada previously confirmed their deaths to Global News, saying they were in contact with local authorities \"to gather more information\" amid the ongoing investigation, but were not able to release any further information due to privacy considerations.\n\nNeither the Dominican National Police, the National Institute of Forensic Sciences, the Attorney General’s Office in the Dominican Republic nor Global Affairs Canada responded to PEOPLE's request for additional comment.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nMore than a week after the tragedy, Gilles says the family is doing okay, but the deaths of their loved ones have been hard to process.\n\n“It's a big loss,\" he says, noting that losing them both at the same time has made everything harder, especially for their kids.\n\nAs for how he wants Alain and Christine to be remembered, her brother says it's for their legacy of kindness.\n\nSharing an example, Gilles says that when his wife died a year and a half ago from leukemia, his sister stepped up to help take care of his daughter, who also works in the family business. Now, in the wake of his sister's death, he says he'll do whatever he can to be there for her kids.\n\nGilles adds, \"I have two kids, but now I have four kids because I will take care of theirs.”",

    "description": "Scott Bessent called it “a historic victory in preserving U.S. sovereignty and protecting American workers and businesses from extraterritorial overreach.\"",
    "fullText": "U.S. multinational corporations will be exempted from paying more corporate taxes overseas in a deal finalized by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nThe OECD announced Monday that nearly 150 countries have agreed on the plan, initially crafted in 2021, to stop large global companies from shifting profits to low-tax countries, no matter where they operate in the world.\n\nThe amended version excludes large U.S.-based multinational corporations from the 15% global minimum tax after negotiations between President Donald Trump’s administration and other members of the Group of Seven wealthy nations.\n\nOECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said in a statement that the agreement is a “landmark decision in international tax co-operation” and “enhances tax certainty, reduces complexity, and protects tax bases.”\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the agreement “a historic victory in preserving U.S. sovereignty and protecting American workers and businesses from extraterritorial overreach.”\n\nThe most recent version of the deal waters down a landmark 2021 agreement that set a minimum global corporate tax of 15%. The idea was to stop multinational corporations, including Apple and Nike, from using accounting and legal maneuvers to shift earnings to low- or no-tax havens.\n\nThose havens are typically places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, where the companies actually do little or no business.\n\nFormer Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was a key driver of the 2021 OECD global tax deal and made the corporate minimum tax one of her top priorities. The plan was widely panned by congressional Republicans who said it would make the U.S. less competitive in a global economy.\n\nThe Trump administration in June re-negotiated the deal when congressional Republicans rolled back a so-called revenge tax provision from Trump’s big tax and spending bill that would have allowed the federal government to impose taxes on companies with foreign owners, as well as on investors from countries judged as charging “unfair foreign taxes” on U.S. companies.\n\nTax transparency groups have criticized the amended OECD plan.\n\n“This deal risks nearly a decade of global progress on corporate taxation only to allow the largest, most profitable American companies to keep parking profits in tax havens,” said Zorka Milin, policy director at the FACT Coalition, a tax transparency nonprofit.\n\nTax watchdogs argue the minimum tax is supposed to halt an international race to the bottom for corporate taxation that has led multinational businesses to book their profits in countries with low tax rates.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Hisense Just Announced the RGB MiniLED Evo",
    "description": "The company also revealed that Xbox Cloud Gaming is coming to its TVs.",
    "fullText": "Hisense is all about TVs at this year's CES—specifically, how those TVs display color. If the company's keynote is any indication, Hisense is extremely invested in leading the charge in color reproduction. Though its tagline this year is \"Innovating a Brighter Life,\" the pitch is less on how bright their TVs are, and more on how true to life their colors are, especially when it comes to accurately displaying the filmmakers' original intent. Will consumers buy a TV because their favorite movie looks a bit more how the director intended it to be? I'm not sure. But that's largely the idea behind Hisense's new RGB MiniLED Evo.\n\nHisense's biggest announcement of the day is its RGB MiniLED Evo. This iteration of the company's RGB MiniLED technology comes with three key upgrades: First, there's the \"Chromagic\" precision backlight. The company says this technology helps avoid color bleeding and tint shifting when watching content. It also boosts the colors offered by existing RGB MiniLED technology: Hisense says this new standard can display 110% of the BT.2020 color gamut with four-primary colors (red, green, blue, and sky blue, or cyan), while RGB MiniLED can achieve 100% BT.2020 with the standard three primary colors. The company says Evo also comes with AI-powered RGB color dimming with \"134 bit precision.\"\n\nSecond, RGB MiniLED Evo has a \"Hi-View AI engine,\" to sync color across the TV's backlight. This engine comes with a three-core RISC CPU and a 2TOPS NPU for AI processing. Hisense claims the chip provides a 40% boost in computing performance, a 70% improvement in scenario recognition computing power, and 100% upgrade in scenario adaption computing capability. The company says the RGB MiniLED Evo can help display shows and movies as the original creators intended them to look. Hisense compared it to OLED, which it says displays content with too little brightness, and QD MiniLED, which it says compromises the color by being too bright.\n\nHisense's RGB MiniLED—not necessarily just Evo—also supposedly cuts down on blue light. Hisense says its new display tech emits 60% \"less harmful\" blue light than QD OLED, though the science doesn't necessarily support the claims that blue light is any worse for you than other light colors. The company also says RGB MiniLED is 30% more energy-efficient than QD OLED, though it didn't include any references to back up those claims in the keynote. Finally, Evo comes with an AI calibration feature, which Hisense touts as a way for users to turn their TVs into professional reference monitors.\n\nThe company says RGB MiniLED evo is coming to its product lineup, including the U8, UX, U9, and U7 series, this year.\n\nWhile the RGB MiniLED Evo was undoubtedly Hisense's biggest announcement this year, the company also ran through some other news at the keynote. First, there's the XR10, a new projector that can reach up to 300 inches. It comes with liquid cooling, lens shift supporting a 4K projection, and 6,000 lumens of brightness.\n\nThe company also announced the MXS MicroLED TV, which can scale up to 163 inches. Despite devoting only a moment to the TV, company says the MXS won an CES 2026 Innovation Award. Hisense also made some announcements about its TV OS, including features like weather, calendar, and integrations with other smart home devices. But perhaps most notably, Hisense announced a partnership with Microsoft to bring both Copilot and Xbox Cloud Gaming to its TVs. That's pretty big news.\n\nFinally, if you're both a Hisense and a FIFA fan, you can buy products from the \"Hisense Elite Collection,\" which are designed specifically for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. I'm not sure how big that crossover is, nor do I think I'd buy a TV because it was made for one soccer event, but it was part of Hisense's announcement.",

If you let someone else use your device—whether you're showing a friend a collection of photos or allowing a stranger to make an emergency call—there's a lot you don't want them to be able to see.\n\nIf you're an iPhone user, there are several features you can enable to prevent others from snooping around your device.\n\nIf you don't want someone using your device to see anything else on it, you can turn on Guided Access, which limits them to a single app (such as Phone or Photos). This essentially locks down your screen and prevents navigation outside of the specific features you make available.\n\nFirst, go to Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access and toggle the feature on. Tap Passcode Settings to set up a specific passcode or flip the Face ID toggle to use biometrics to end Guided Access sessions.\n\nTo start a Guided Access session before handing over your phone, open the app and triple click the side button. You can circle specific areas of the screen you don't want to respond to touch (such as swipes through Photos). Tap Session Settings at the bottom to set a time limit, disable the keyboard, and manage button press options. Then tap Start.\n\nTo end a Guided Access session, triple-click the side button and enter your passcode or double-click and authenticate with Face ID.\n\nSome mobile apps, like financial apps and password managers, already require you to log in or authenticate with your username and password combo or device biometrics every time you open them. You can also lock down other individual apps on iPhone so Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode is required for access. To lock an app from your home screen, touch and hold the icon until the quick actions menu appears, then tap Require Face ID.\n\nAlternatively, you can hide apps so others cannot see them on your device (let alone open them) unless you authenticate using Face ID, Touch ID or a passcode. To hide an app, tap and hold the icon on the home screen and tap Require Face ID in the quick actions menu. Tap Hide and Require Face ID > Hide App. If you need to open a hidden app, swipe left on your home screen to reach your App Library, locate the Hidden folder at the bottom, and tap and authenticate to unlock the folder followed by the app.\n\n(Note that some native iOS apps, including Calculator, Camera, Clock, Contacts, Find My, Maps, Shortcuts, and Settings, cannot be locked, and system apps that come preinstalled cannot be hidden.)",

    "fullText": "A father suffered serious head injuries during a brawl that broke out in the queue for a popular ride at Disneyland over the winter break.\n\nThe fight occurred last Tuesday afternoon in line for the Indiana Jones Adventure, one of the marquee dark rides at the Anaheim theme park, police and Disneyland officials confirmed.\n\n“A group of people were waiting in line at Indiana Jones when another group cut through the line to catch up with other family members,” Anaheim Police Sgt. Matt Sutter told KTLA.\n\nThe confrontation escalated into a roughly 30-second fight between two men, shocking parkgoers, including many children. Witnesses said the man whose family cut into the line brutally beat the other, who was visiting the park from Washington state with his family.\n\n“There were several people intervening to stop the guy,” wrote Reddit user ImaginaryBag. “He managed to get some hits in even with people blocking. Then he stepped back a bit so others did too. That’s when he jumped in for one last sucker punch, which drew blood, and then he ran off with his family following.”\n\nPolice confirmed the suspect fled Disneyland and remained at large as of Monday morning. Sutter said investigators have strong leads on his identity and believe he is a Southern California resident.\n\n“There are two sides to every story, so we need to hear from him (and) what happened from his point of view,” Sutter told KTLA’s Sara Welch.\n\nThe victim, whose name was not released, was treated by Disneyland’s first aid staff for injuries including a large gash on his face that required stitches.\n\n“He refused to hit back (which took a lot of discipline) because he didn’t want the rest of the family to get kicked out or us blacklisted,” wrote Reddit user Wittwitbarista, who said the victim is her husband.\n\nDespite the ordeal, the family stayed at the park for the rest of the day.\n\n“Hubby had no concussion, stitches, okay honestly … Disney Security, nurses and (cast members) were all so magically wonderful,” Wittwitbarista wrote.\n\nThis was the second incident that same day involving an Indiana Jones attraction at a Disney park. A 400-pound inflatable boulder prop rolled off its track during the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular at Disney’s Hollywood Studios, injuring a park employee who stepped in front of it to keep it from bouncing into the crowd.",

    "fullText": "Jan 5 (Reuters) - Intel launched Panther Lake, its new AI chip for laptops, on Monday at the CES trade show in Las Vegas, as the company seeks to ​reassure investors about the first product made using its next-generation manufacturing process called 18A.\n\nJim Johnson, ‌senior vice president and general manager of Intel's PC group, offered technical details about the company's first line of Panther Lake chips known ‌as Intel Core Ultra Series 3. The chips feature a new transistor design and a way to deliver power to the chip due to the company's 18A manufacturing process.\n\nAt the event, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company made good on its promise to ship its first products with the 18A manufacturing process in 2025, referring to ⁠the Panther Lake chips.\n\nIntel's prior-generation Lunar ‌Lake chips were largely made by TSMC. The stakes for Intel are high - the company is making its first high-volume product with 18A, and hopes to reclaim market share ‍it has lost to Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nJohnson said the company has created a separate graphics chiplet - a mini chip stitched together with other mini-chips to form a complete processor. On Monday, Intel said the Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips ​would deliver 60% better performance than the prior-generation Lunar Lake Series 2.\n\nIntel plans to launch a platform ‌for handheld video games based on the Panther Lake designs this year, Johnson said. Handheld PCs designed by a range of suppliers have grown in popularity in recent years.\n\nIntel has struggled with the yield, or the number of good chips per silicon wafer, for the Panther Lake processors, Reuters reported last year. Intel executives have said its yields are improving monthly and will pave the way for the launch this year.\n\nFor its part, ⁠AMD plans to give a CES keynote address at 9:30 p.m. ​EST on Monday  (0230 GMT on Tuesday). CEO Lisa Su will ​likely launch new generations of PC chips that are geared for AI and graphics.\n\nAMD announced a multibillion-dollar deal with OpenAI for its next-generation MI400 chips, some of which the companies ‍plan to deploy this year. ⁠The deal with the ChatGPT maker is expected to generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue for the chip designer.\n\nThe CEO of AI chip leader Nvidia, Jensen Huang, also spoke at CES ⁠on Monday. He said the company’s next generation of chips was in “full production,” and they could deliver five times the artificial-intelligence computing ‌of the company’s previous chips when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Petkit's Yumshare Daily Feast Is an Automatic Wet Food Feeder for Your Cat",
    "description": "The Yumshare can automatically dispense wet food for up to one week.",
    "fullText": "I don't have a cat, but I do have a dog, and my dog can be a picky eater. After months of trial and error, the only way we could get him to consistently eat breakfast and dinner was with wet food. There is no scenario in which I or someone watching my dog can outsource the task of feeding him, but that's not the case for cat owners. I know that cats sometimes stay home alone for extended periods of time, where an automatic food dispenser becomes essential. I can only imagine, then, that cat owners who, like me, feed their pet wet food, now have a challenge: Someone has to be there to feed the cat.\n\nThat's what intrigues me about Petkit's Yumshare Daily Feast, an automated cat feeder that specifically works with wet food. I covered the Yumshare briefly when Petkit first announced it last week, but I got some hands-on time with the product today on the CES show floor. And while the device I saw isn't going to market just yet, I was intrigued.\n\nThe concept itself is pretty simple, but a bit more complex in execution. As you might expect, the feeder distributes portions of food for your cat to eat when you're not available—only here, that food is wet, not dry. To achieve this, Petkit outfitted the Yumshare with a chamber that can hold up to seven pouches of wet food at once. These pouches are designed for the Yumshare alone: Right now, the only company making pouches is Food Chain, which uses Petkit's proprietary design to fit the Yumshare, but it's possible more companies more jump on board in the future.\n\nWhen the Yumshare first opens one of these pouches, it sets a timer: After 48 hours, the pouch is discarded. In the meantime, the machine can automatically dole out portions set by the user, into a cup, which is stored in a separate chamber in the device. Once the portion is distributed, the pouch is sealed until the next portion is needed. The machine also uses UVC ultraviolet light to sanitize the package, with the goal of eliminating bacteria.\n\nThe automation extends to the portion of wet food itself, as well. Whether your cat eats all of the food, some of the food, or none of the food, the Yumshare can discard what's left when it detects it's time to do so. That might be the AI camera identifying that the food has dried up, or an internal clock recognizing that too much time has passed for the food to be safe to eat. Either way, the food drops into a waste compartment, which can hold up to 15 cups at once. The stand remains empty until it's time to hand out another portion of food.\n\nHow large or small each portion is, as well as how often portions are distributed, is up to you. Petkit showed me a mockup of the Yumshare's app, which lets you customize this feeding schedule. The app will also tell you how many portions have been distributed, and how many are left in the chamber. You can also take a look at a live video feed of your cat, via the 4K camera embedded in the device, or view a clip history of your cat's feeding habits.\n\nMy only question is the lack of refrigeration: Petkit says that there is no need for it, since the pouches are all sealed until use, closed in between portions, and the chamber uses ultraviolet light to sterilize for bacteria. But I'd want to confirm there are no health risks to keeping an opened pouch unrefrigerated for up to two full days, even with that UVC light. Assuming that's true, I'm quite impressed with this prototype. If I were a cat owner that frequently needed to leave my pet alone at breakfast and dinner, this is something I'd have my eye on.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Asus' New Gaming Laptop Looks Like a Gigantic Nintendo DS",
    "description": "The ROG Zephyrus Duo is back for 2026, with two full-sized screens.",
    "fullText": "CES is the time of year for weird computers, and Asus is bringing back an old fan favorite to help fill its unusual form factor quota. Gamers who miss the days of dual screens, get excited: the ROG Zephyrus Duo is returning for 2026, and it's bigger than ever.\n\nLooking a bit like a gigantic Nintendo DS, the new ROG Zephyrus Duo stacks two full-sized 3K OLED screens on top of each other, with a standard laptop hinge in between. It's a lot like the company's existing Zenbook Duo, but that one's geared more for productivity users—the Zephyrus Duo is fully specced out for gamers, with a 120Hz refresh rate on both screens, the latest Intel Core Ultra chips, up to an RTX 5090 laptop GPU, up to 64GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage. Plus, it supports 250W fast charging and can play games using up to 125W of power.\n\nThat's plenty for even the most demanding games, although its price is still an unknown for now. What we do know is how different this is from the last Zephyrus Duo, which came out in 2023. That laptop's lower screen was a simple small angled panel above the keyboard, instead of a full-sized display matching the upper one. It was great for displaying stats at a glance while playing, but not much else.\n\nInstead, the new Zephyrus Duo can display the same game across both screens, mirror them, or pull up reference material on one screen while you play on the other. It's also got a bunch of new ways you can use it: It comes with a detachable wireless keyboard, and you can either use it like a normal laptop with that keyboard covering one of the screens, or get creative.\n\nAn example photo from Asus show the laptop with one screen above the other, both screens in a side-to-side portrait mode, the whole laptop laid flat on a table (perhaps for head-to-head play), and tent mode. Tent mode is especially interesting—an Asus representative told journalists that gamers could play the same game against each other while sitting across from each other in tent mode, with each display acting as a private screen. He did acknowledge that this might impact performance and compatibility might differ based on game, but I could see it being an especially great option for, say, fighting games.\n\nAgain, this format has been used for non-gaming laptops before, but it's seemingly got a lot of potential for gamers, too. There's a reason one of Nintendo's most popular handhelds opted for a dual-screen setup. And hey, maybe you could even play some DS games made on this, too.\n\nThe new ROG Zephyrus Duo is expected to launch sometime in Q2 of this year.",

    "description": "Help me, ROG. You're my only hope.",
    "fullText": "With the rise of streaming culture, a lot of gamers have started investing in computers that don't just play games well, but that look good while doing it. Asus's newest pre-built gaming desktop, the ROG G1000, is pretty by-the-book when it comes to high-end performance, but it's got one major selling point when it comes to those all-important gamer aesthetics: holograms.\n\nBuilt into this computer's front panel and one of its side panels, safely tucked into inaccessible glass windows, are rapidly rotating LED strips that, when in motion, create convincing full-color images that appear to have depth. The \"frame rate\" can be a little low, but it's a known technology that's all over the show floor at every CES now, and you can actually buy generic standalone hologram fans on Amazon for around $60-$100. It's just rare to see it integrated into something like a PC.\n\nThis hologram tech, called AniMe Holo, should make for a great way to show off on camera (or to your buddies in a college dorm) and Asus is promising some pretty expansive customizability. You can put still images and gifs on it, sure, but Asus also told journalists it can support full videos or mp4 files, without any limit on length. I think I'd try to use it to watch Shrek.\n\nThe effect comes across a bit better in-person, but it's still unusual enough to look enticing over video, even if you lose some of the depth. Unfortunately, still photos aren't really a great way to show this thing off, since they can't depict the rotating motion.\n\nAesthetics aside, the G1000 is also at the top of the power game, coming with the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X 3D CPU, an RTX 5090 GPU, up to 128GB of RAM, and a 2TB storage. It's got bite to back up its bark, and will be able to play the latest games at max settings with no issue.\n\nOf course, specs like that are likely to cost you a pretty penny, especially with the hologram gimmick tossed on top of them. Asus hasn't tipped its hand on pricing yet, but the ROG G1000 is expected to launch sometime in Q2 of this year.",

The Honkai franchise is known for its anime-style graphics, quick and fluid combat, and expansive stories. While Honkai: Nexus Anima is keeping many of those same elements, the developers are also changing up the core gameplay loop in some significant ways. Of course, you can still expect a similar feeling as the four previous games, but Nexus Anima is breathing some fresh ideas into the franchise.\nWhile we don't know everything about the new Honkai title, we've seen plenty of gameplay and heard enough details to get a good idea of what it has in store for the community.",

Lorwyn Eclipsed will see the MTG community return to the dual planes of Lorwyn and Shadowmoor, which were previously separated by light and darkness, but have now intertwined to create new and exciting creatures and spells. Wizards of the Coast has begun to reveal cards from the upcoming set, with many shown off during a livestream today.\n\nThe first reveal of Lorwyn Eclipsed featured faces new and old from the Magic universe, including first-year Strixhaven student Abigale, and the mischievous elven sorcerer Oko. Multiple cards, mechanics, and treatments were shown off during the livestream, including the return of Anime Showcase treatments, as well as a mini bonus sheet of Special Guest reprints from Magic's past.\n\nThe reveal came coupled with a brief music video, One Light, One Dark: A Boggart Ballad. The short story featured two boggarts, one living in Lorwyn and the other in Shadowmoor, and both were represented by puppets created in partnership between Wizards of the Coast and the Jim Henson company.\n\nWe'll be updating this gallery with more cards from Lorwyn Eclipsed as they are revealed throughout the week, with the final previews slated for January 9. Lorwyn Eclipsed, meanwhile, is set to launch on January 23 in both local game stores and big box retailers, with pre-release events scheduled to begin one week earlier on January 16.",

    "fullText": "On days like this, when a manager falls, the immediate reaction is to think about where it all went wrong, the timeline of doom, the moments where the writing started appearing on the wall.\n\nWith Wilfried Nancy, there's no need for any of that because it was never right in the first place. There were no turning points in this saga, no twists in the plot.\n\nNancy's appointment was one of the greatest blunders Celtic have made in their history. A relative rookie on a bad run with Columbus Crew - they finished seventh in Major League Soccer - it was a punt based on little more than the hipster vibes of Paul Tisdale, the now former head of football operations.\n\nTisdale didn't open his mouth to fans or media in his brief time in a powerful position at Celtic Park, but he did a whole lot of damage. If Nancy ranks extremely highly in the club's most calamitous calls then Tisdale is on a par or, perhaps even, slightly ahead of him given that it was the self-styled 'Doctor Football' who championed Nancy to the club's board.\n\nNancy never got out of the blocks, his two wins from eight games coming in a flawed victory over bottom-of-the-table Livingston and a triumph over 10-man Aberdeen, who have also just sacked their manager.\n\nAll memory of Nancy's reign - if you want to call it that - will be shovelled under a carpet now by anybody and everybody culpable in the process of appointing him. If they're all true to recent form, none of them will speak, none will apologise, none will show humility by accepting that they got this woefully wrong.\n\nThe fans will have to make-do with a short written statement. Let them eat cake, in other words.\n\nNancy's laidback arrival - spending just 15 minutes talking with Martin O'Neill before ripping up everything O'Neill had done to stabilise things - was in stark contrast to the unceremonious manner of his exit. O'Neill, as interim, was there longer than Nancy.",

I don't believe United should change for anybody. The club has to find a manager who has got experience and who's willing to play fast entertaining, attacking and aggressive football.\"\n\nAmorim arrived at United with a clear tactical vision, favouring the 3-4-3 formation that had brought him success at Sporting, but United struggled to adapt.\n\n\"I thought they'd adapt better to the back three than they did,\" Neville said. \"I'm really stunned that they've continued to play so poorly in that system.\"\n\nSpeaking on The Rest Is Football podcast, former England striker Gary Lineker said: \"I think it was almost as though [Amorim] provoked it.\n\n\"It didn't seem to be the right fit and he was a bit stubborn about the way he wanted to play.

    "fullText": "Martin O'Neill is returning to Celtic as manager for the remainder of the season following the dismissal of Wilfried Nancy.\n\nThe 73-year-old stepped in for eight games in the wake of Brendan Rodgers' exit in October, winning seven of those.\n\nHe made way for Nancy in early December but the Frenchman departed on Monday after a sorry run of just two wins from eight matches.\n\n\"I am really pleased, in fact, very honoured to be asked back to manage the team again and I am looking forward to getting back to work again with the players,\" O'Neill told club media.\n\n\"I know we would all have hoped for things to have worked out differently under Wilfried and I personally want to wish him good luck with everything he does in the game. He is a fine man and I am sure he will go on and achieve success again, I have no doubt of that.\n\n\"For me, I've been asked to take this great job on again and my focus will be to try and get us back to winning ways if we can. We will need everyone right behind us.\"\n\nO'Neill, who won seven trophies with Celtic from 2000-05, will again be assisted by Shaun Maloney, Mark Fotheringham and Stephen McManus.\n\nCeltic, champions in 13 of the past 14 seasons, currently sit second in the Scottish Premiership, six points behind Hearts and ahead of Rangers on goals scored.\n\nUnder Nancy, they were beaten in the League Cup final by St Mirren, with O'Neill having overseen the semi-final win over Rangers.\n\n\"We still have a lot to look forward to and a lot to try and achieve, and myself, Shaun and the coaching staff and, of course, the players will be giving everything to achieve all the success we can for the club,\" added O'Neill.",
