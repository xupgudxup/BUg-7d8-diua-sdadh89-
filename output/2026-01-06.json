    "description": "Could the Cubs land Edward Cabrera? We analyze potential trade packages, including top prospects, to acquire the Marlins' ace pitcher.",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Cubs continue to do their due diligence on several players this offseason.\n\nOver the past week, the Cubs have been linked to Alex Bregman, Bo Bichette, and Cody Bellinger in free agency. With the North Siders needing another impactful bat in their lineup, it’s not surprising to see them interested in so many of the top remaining bats on the open market.\n\nAnother name has also popped up in connection with the Cubs. This time, it’s a pitcher in the trade market.\n\nAccording to Jon Heyman of the New York Post, Chicago is reportedly interested in trading for Miami Marlins pitcher Edward Cabrera. Although the New York Yankees appear to be in deeper talks with the Marlins for Cabrera, the Cubs being mentioned here is significant.\n\nAfter failing to sign Tatsuya Imai in free agency, it appears the Cubs are now pivoting to the trade market. The front office was interested in trading for Cabrera at the 2025 Trade Deadline, but the Marlins' asking price was a bit too high.\n\nBut those trade talks have likely picked up since the Cubs missed out on Imai. The team still needs a frontline starting pitcher, and Cabrera would be the perfect answer for Chicago. He showed last year that he can be a reliable arm in any rotation.\n\nSo, what could a deal look like between the Cubs and the Marlins involving Cabrera?\n\nWe’ll use two different sources to identify who the Cubs might have to give up in any deal involving Cabrera.\n\nOur first source comes from Eric Hubbs of Barstool Sports. He reported that the Yankees could include No. 6 prospect Ben Hess and No. 16 prospect Dillon Lewis in any deal for Cabrera. FanSided insider Robert Murray actually gave Hubbs his flowers for accurately reporting that in an episode of the Baseball Insiders Podcast.\n\nOur second source comes from Baseball Trade Values. This site does a great job of comparing players’ trade values. With Cabrera having a 27.6 value in their model, we can identify who the Cubs need to give up for the right-hander.\n\nEven though the Yankees are only said to be giving up their No. 6 and No. 16 prospect, it likely would cost the Cubs a lot more to acquire Cabrera. Both Hess and Lewis have a ton of potential, and both are rising stars in New York’s farm system.\n\nFor the Cubs, giving up No. 3 prospect Jaxon Wiggins and No. 5 prospect Kevin Alcantara could complete the deal. Both Wiggins' (21.3) and Alcantara’s (7.3) trade values in that model basically equal Cabrera’s trade value (28.6).\n\nThe Marlins would essentially get two ready-now players who have plenty of potential, and the Cubs would get a top-of-the-line starting pitcher who still has three years of control remaining. Cabrera isn’t a free agent until after the 2028 season.\n\nHowever, it all depends on whether the Cubs would actually deal Wiggins in any trade for Cabrera. The team’s top pitching prospect is set to contribute to the Major League club at some point in 2026 and projects to be a dominant rotation arm.",

    "description": "Daniel Cormier lauds Jake Paul for being brave, but doesn't think he's very smart.",
    "fullText": "Daniel Cormier lauds Jake Paul for being brave, but doesn't think he's very smart.\n\nPaul was knocked out by former two-time unified heavyweight champion and Olympic gold medalist Anthony Joshua in Round 6 of their boxing match at Kaseya Center in Miami last month.\n\nThe loss resulted in Paul breaking his jaw in two places, but that hasn't stopped the 28-year-old, who immediately turned his attention to Francis Ngannou.\n\n\"Jake Paul just got his head bashed in by Anthony Joshua, right? That was about as big a learning lesson that anyone could have been taught,\" Cormier said on his YouTube channel. \"Here's the problem: Jake Paul has proven to be, one, hard-headed; two, more bold and brave than anyone could have ever imagined – bold and brave because he fought Anthony Joshua to begin with.\n\n\"Bold and brave because they didn't put any things in place to make sure Anthony didn't do exactly what he did to him, broke his jaw in multiple places, got him sucking out of a straw. It would seem like his bold and brave attitude really cost him. And with that bold and brave attitude a lot of the times comes cowardice after. Not Jake Paul. Not Jake Paul. You can love him, you can hate him, but he's brave.\"\n\nCormier is shocked to see Paul go after Ngannou, who almost beat Tyson Fury, but also got knocked out by Joshua.\n\n\"I would have thought, I swear to God, I would have thought that after what happened with Anthony Joshua, Jake Paul would say, 'OK, let me rematch Anderson (Silva) or somebody,\" Cormier said. \"You would have thought Jake Paul would go, 'You know what? I'm going to rematch Anderson, maybe I will find another mixed marital arts guy that's a little bit over the hill to try to fight where it's more safe and it's a more controlled environment because the problem with the Anthony Joshua fight is it wasn't controlled. It was just a fight. That's not Jake Paul, though. He immediately goes back after Francis Ngannou. It's crazy to me.\"\n\nWhen Gervonta Davis withdrew from his fight against Paul, \"The Problem Child\" called out Ngannou, but Ngannou wasn't interested. Joshua ended up taking the fight instead, which Cormier thinks would now make Ngannou open to fighting Paul.\n\nHowever, Cormier thinks it would be a bad idea for Paul.\n\n\"For as small as Jake looked against Anthony, he'll look equally as small against Francis Ngannou,\" Cormier said. \"But I think what's happening with Jake is he's wanting to show that Anthony Joshua didn't knock scared into him, which in reality he probably should have knocked a little scared into him.\n\n\"I just don't think (Paul) can hurt him. I just don't know that he can hurt Francis like he thinks he can hurt Francis. You can never question the boldness of Jake Paul. You could never question the toughness of Jake Paul. I question his smarts. I think he needs to reconsider.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: UFC analyst warns Jake Paul of calling out Francis Ngannou",

Here’s the full breakdown:\n\nAfter an underwhelming season, the Ravens will have some major questions over the offseason. Will John Harbaugh still be on the sideline in Baltimore at the start of next season? We’ll have to wait and see.

    "description": "The Bengals' offseason seems to be setting up exactly as needed: With every possible opportunity to focus on the defense.",
    "fullText": "It's early in the NFL offseason for teams that missed the playoffs, but the Cincinnati Bengals' offseason seems to be setting up exactly as needed: With every possible opportunity to focus on the defense.\n\nThat starts with continuity on the coaching staff, and the fact that Al Golden will likely return as the team's defensive coordinator. After receiving the backing of team owner and President Mike Brown earlier in the day, head coach Zac Taylor voiced his support for Golden during a Jan. 5 news conference at Paycor Stadium and said he did not plan any staff changes.\n\nPersonnel-wise, there's plenty of business the Bengals can get done on the offensive side of the ball, including extending the contracts of players like 1,000-yard running Chase Brown. But the key offensive cogs are locked up for next year. There aren't any nagging contract situations that must be addressed, such as the past mega-deals for players like quarterback Joe Burrow and receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins.\n\nMost of the other skill position players and offensive linemen are locked up contractually. And the one unsigned lineman many players would like to see return, and who has voiced interest in returning, is Dalton Risner. Risner confirmed his interest in returning to Cincinnati during a Jan. 4 interview with The Enquirer.\n\nOn the defensive side of the ball, there doesn't appear to be any lingering contract issues that would cast a pall on the offseason like Trey Hendrickson's did last year.\n\nIn short, the Bengals can pour much of their focus into the defense, which ended 2025 ranked No. 31 out of 32 teams in total defense.\n\n\"That’s the truth of it. There’s no real sugarcoating that. You got a bunch of (defensive) guys coming back,\" Taylor said. \"It’s exciting because you can focus your energy. There’s so many guys on that side of the ball that, really, their growth was accelerated over the last half of the year. You are really excited about their future here as starters (and) as role players. I feel like we are in a tremendous position going into this offseason.\n\n\"Our expectations are going to be sky high, and we are going to work like heck to meet those expectations. I think the players and coaches all see the direction we are headed. So there is a lot of positive energy heading into the offseason.\"\n\nTaylor on Jan. 5 continued to trumpet the statistical defensive improvement under Golden following Cincinnati's Nov. 9 bye week, although the team went 3-5 during that stretch and lost three one-score games. Bengals' offensive turnovers leading to opposition touchdowns also played a role in several of those games. Golden's unit didn't have much to do with those moments.\n\nTaylor also offered insight into a shorter runway for Golden to onboard with the Bengals following his run as Notre Dame's defensive coordinator for the College Football Playoff. That run ran all the way through to the National Championship game in Atlanta on Jan. 20, 2025. The Bengals then hired Golden and started to take meaningful steps in assembling the defensive coaching staff around him.\n\nThere were times it felt like the Bengals were one missed tackle or one play of some kind from winning. Instead, they more often than not let those games get away. Several players on Jan. 5 said they viewed that perspective as evidence the team is close.\n\nSimilarly, Taylor said he believed the defense was close to being where he needed it to be.\n\n\"I think that staff really worked hard to come together and get on the same page with scheme and how we're going to coach these guys,\" Taylor said. \"So, like anything, I saw great growth from that side of the ball. And they closed (by) giving up 18 points or something a game over the last eight games. And there's a lot of statistics I can read where it shows marked improvement. And so again, I like the direction that group is headed. I like the direction our team is headed. I know how it sounds when we come off the record we just had, but again, I've got a lot of excitement, and I'm excited to get back to work and get these guys ready for next year.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Zac Taylor said no Bengals' coaching staff changes are planned",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M landed its seventh transfer addition since the portal opened on Monday afternoon, securing its second offensive line commitment, as South Carolina guard Trovon Baugh will head to College Station this spring, and I can safely say that this one came out of nowhere. After landing LSU guard and former Texas A&M commit Coen Echols, head coach Mike Elko has added more beef in the trenches.\n\nWith starting left tackle Trey Zuhn, right guard Ar'maj Reed-Adams, and right tackle Dametreous Crownover all departing for the NFL Draft, landing two experienced offensive linemen was crucial before entering the spring season, while left guard Chase Bisontis has yet to decide his playing future. For those who aren't familiar with Baugh, he started 11 of 12 games at right guard for the Gamecocks last season, logging 611 snaps, while his overall performance is a mixed bag with more positives than negatives.\n\nAccording to Pro Football Focus, Baugh earned average grades, but did finish the year with four 80-plus pass protection grades, and earned at least 50 or above grades as a run blocker, proving that there's still plenty of room for improvement. On paper, with Adams leaving, Baugh will likely compete with Coen Echols and sophomore guard Blake Ivy for the starting right guard spot.\n\nStanding at 6'3\" and 335 pounds, Baugh possesses NFL size and strength, but still needs to refine his technique to reach his full potential. Mike Elko has filled another gap in the roster.\n\nMore beef 🥩 \n\nWelcome to Aggieland, @BaughTrovon 👍 pic.twitter.com/To8BGNl1i2\n\n— TexAgs Recruiting (@TA_Recruiting) January 5, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M land commitment from South Carolina transfer OL Trovon Baugh",

This is Canada’s sixth bronze medal at the World Juniors and their 36th overall.\n\nThe past few World Junior Championships have been rough for Canada, as they have been eliminated from gold medal contention by Czechia for the past three straight years. Their last gold medal came in 2023, during which they took down none-other than Czechia to achieve the feat. Prior to this year, this was Canada’s last medal placement. The last time Canada placed third at the World Juniors was in 2012.\n\nThe 2026 World Junior Championship was an interesting one for Cootes, who played predominantly on Canada’s fourth line despite a decent showing at his team’s training camp. In today’s game, Cootes scored his second goal of the tournament and played in a total of 6:21 minutes. He finishes the tournament with two goals, seven shots on goal, and an average of 8:48 minutes played per game.\n\nWith Canada and Finland’s bronze-medal game now wrapped up, fans’ attention will turn to Canucks prospect Wilson Björck and Team Sweden as they take on Czechia for gold. Sweden’s last gold medal game appearance came in 2024, during which they lost 6–2 to Team USA. Canucks players Jonathan Lekkerimäki, Elias Pettersson (D), Tom Willander, Liam Öhgren, and Zeev Buium took part in this game.

    "description": "The Reds have a bright future.",
    "fullText": "The Cincinnati Reds feature a number of young players with high ceilings. It is easy to forget that Elly De La Cruz is still only 23 years old. Today, however, we are going to take a look at three of the Reds' top prospects and break down their skill sets, potential and MLB outlooks.\n\nStewart, a 22-year-old versatile infielder, made his MLB debut in 2025. He was also the Reds' top prospect in 2025, per MLB.com.\n\nStewart is known for his hitting prowess, while his defensive versatility makes him an especially intriguing prospect. He's developing as a power threat, and Stewart is a guy who could hit for a quality average at the big league level.\n\nBetween Double-A and Triple-A in 2025, Stewart slashed .309/.383/.525 while also recording a .907 OPS and 20 home runs. His 18 MLB games saw him hit .255/.293/.545 with five home runs and an .838 OPS.\n\nHe features the talent and potential to become the next star in Cincinnati.\n\nDuno, the No. 2 prospect for the Reds in 2025, is a 19-year-old catcher. With an MLB ETA of 2028, Duno is still working toward becoming big league ready. It would not be surprising to see him become the team's catcher of the future down the road, though.\n\nIn 2025 at Single-A, Duno slashed .287/.430/.518 to go along with 18 home runs and a .948 OPS. While it was only Single-A ball, Duno is seemingly ready for the next level given his performance.\n\nWhile his offensive ability is clearly trending in the right direction, Duno's throwing arm from behind the plate may be the best facet of his game. Opponents are going to have a difficult time attempting to steal bases with Duno as the backstop.\n\nLewis, a 19-year-old shortstop who was the Reds' No. 3 overall prospect in 2025, may have to switch positions at some point in the future with De La Cruz at shortstop with the MLB team. An athletic infielder who stands 6'2\", a position move would likely not be an issue for Lewis.\n\nHe has a good arm, but his defense is still a work-in-progress. Lewis is still progressing offensively, but his 2025 performance was impressive. He slashed .311/.376/.486 with an .862 OPS, nine home runs and 27 stolen bases at Single-A.\n\nLewis is going to steal bases. The question is whether or not he will hit at a consistent enough level to become a star at the big league level. If he does turn into a respectable offensive presence, Lewis should have a bright future with the Reds moving forward.",

    "fullText": "MANHATTAN — Right when you thought Kansas State football might be done for the day, the Wildcats landed a seventh commitment from the transfer portal on Monday, Jan. 5.\n\nGardner-Webb defensive tackle De'Arieun Hicks committed to K-State, according to On3's Pete Nakos. The 6-foot-4, 285-pounder has three years of eligibility and totaled 21 tackles, with 4.5 being for a loss in 2025.\n\nHicks reportedly had a visit to Iowa State on Monday, after spending Jan. 3 with the Wildcats, and he chose to play football in Manhattan.\n\nHicks was a standout for the FCS program out of the Big South, playing 373 snaps and making four starts on the Runnin' Bulldogs' defensive line. He was the Big South's sixth-highest graded defensive lineman, according to Pro Football Focus, with the league's 12th-best pass rush grade.\n\nHicks totaled 10 pressures, with seven quarterback hurries and a pair of sacks across 12 games.\n\nOut of high school in Richmond, Indiana, Hicks wasn't given a grade by 247Sports.\n\nKansas State was in desperate need of defensive linemen from the transfer portal following the departures of Malcolm Alcorn-Crowder and Andy Burburija, the latter of whom reopened his recruitment after initially signing with the Wildcats. The Wildcats also signed Adrian Bekibele, Kingston Hall and Carnell Jackson Jr. during December's signing period.\n\nHicks' size is certainly appealing, giving the Wildcats a solid prospect to develop. Given the Wildcats' need at the position, Hicks could have an opportunity to get on the field quickly.\n\nHicks joins Oklahoma State running back Rodney Fields Jr., Texas A&M receiver Izaiah Williams, Illinois corner Kaleb Patterson, Oklahoma State linebacker Jacobi Oliphant, Miami (Ohio) safety Koy Beasley and Missouri offensive lineman Keiton Jones as those who committed to the Wildcats on Monday.\n\nWyatt D.

    "description": "In the midst of growing speculation surrounding Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles, his players are showing him plenty of support.",
    "fullText": "One of the biggest question marks as the NFL enters its offseason surrounds the future of Todd Bowles as head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Speculation has been mounting, at least among the public, about whether or not the franchise should bring Bowles back for a fifth season in charge following another 8-9 season and missing the playoffs for the first time since 2019.\n\nThere is at least one group of people that is fully supportive of Bowles and that is the players of the Buccaneers organization.\n\nThat starts with one of the anchors of the offensive line, offensive tackle Tristan Wirfs.\n\n“I love coach Bowles,” Wirfs said about Bowles. “I see all the talk on Twitter, I really don't care about it — it's just people sitting at home, talking about it. We know what we have in this building. If something happens, something happens, if something doesn't, something doesn't. The season is coming regardless, and we're all gonna be ready.”\n\nTristan Wirfs speaks on the future of Todd Bowles with Bucs. \n\n“I see all of the talk on Twitter. I really don’t care about it. \n\nIf something happens, something happens. If something doesn’t, something doesn’t.” pic.twitter.com/2CPVlFk2Ey\n\n— Logan B. Robinson (@LogansTwitty) January 5, 2026\n\nAnother player that added support for Bowles coming back is second-year wide receiver Jalen McMillan, who battled a neck injury throughout the season.\n\n“He's a great leader,” McMillan said, via River Wells. “He's somebody who shows up to work every day and he's going to give you the same type of effort, every day. He's my guy. I love him to death. Hopefully, he stays here.”\n\nJalen McMillan on increasing chatter on Todd Bowles’ job security:\n\n“He’s my guy. I love him to death. I hope he stays here.” pic.twitter.com/5YKeeE2Dgj\n\n— River Wells (@riverhwells) January 5, 2026\n\nIt was a disappointing finish for the Buccaneers. After a 5-1 start and a 6-2 first half of the season, the wheels completely fell off and the Buccaneers would win just two of their last nine games.\n\nThey finished the season with a win over the Carolina Panthers but the Atlanta Falcons, who are also now looking for a head coach after firing Raheem Morris Sunday, then defeated the New Orleans Saints on Sunday to create a three-way tie atop the NFC South, a tie that did not favor the Buccaneers and left them on the outside looking in.\n\nAs a result, they will now look ahead to the draft with the 15th overall pick. The question is whether or not Bowles will help make that draft pick.\n\nHis players clearly want him to stay. But ultimately, ownership has the final say. It’s looking more like the team will keep Bowles for another season, but things can change quickly.",

He wasn’t going to let his career end that way, and he was motivated that night to return to play with the only franchise he’s ever known.\n\nAfter the Raiders' loss, however, he was much more split. He explained that he doesn’t know at the moment when he will decide what he will do for the rest of the year regarding football.\n\nOne of the most successful players on and off the field, Kelce is scheduled to marry his partner, world pop star Taylor Swift, this coming June in Rhode Island.\n\nHe also hosts one of the most popular podcasts in North America, “New Heights” with his brother, retired NFL lineman and fellow Super Bowl champion Jason Kelce.\n\nEven Travis’ mother, Donna, is set to make her big television debut in only a few days on “The Traitors,” a competitive reality show produced by NBC on Peacock.\n\nWe will keep you updated on Kelce’s decision on whether he will play his 14th season in the NFL or if Sunday was his last dance.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Did Travis Kelce Retire From NFL, Chiefs After Week 18 Loss?",

    "fullText": "EAGAN, Minn. (AP) — The Minnesota Vikings lost their bet this season that they could develop J.J. McCarthy and still win at the same time, with a roster strong enough to withstand the typical inconsistencies of a young quarterback in his debut.\n\nThe worst part of their failed gamble for 2025 was that it left plenty more mystery for 2026. The Vikings have begun a new year with yet another quarterback quandary, a familiar scenario for this star-crossed franchise.\n\nAsked after the final game on Sunday if he would be comfortable entering next season with McCarthy as the starter, coach Kevin O'Connell sidestepped the question.\n\n“I can’t wait to work with him in the offseason and absolutely look forward to the continued development and improvement,\" O'Connell said, \"and I’m excited where he’s ending the season and know there’s some things we can really dive into as a group.”\n\nThe Vikings made sure not to miss out on the record quarterback rush at the top of the 2024 draft, confidently selecting McCarthy with the 10th pick as the promising prospect for their reputable system they could mold into a long-term fixture at this vital and vexing position.\n\nBut his injuries have put them behind on the evaluation. The fact that he has only started 10 games and finished eight over his first two years is the most concerning of any metric. Even when he was healthy, the struggles with accuracy were pronounced enough to make them consider alternatives despite the significant upside on display.\n\nAfter winging it with Carson Wentz and Max Brosmer as the backups, at the very least the Vikings realize they need better depth if they're going to run McCarthy back next season. McCarthy, for his part, sounded aware that his hold on the starting job is tenuous, too.\n\n\"There’s nothing promised. That’s something I take very seriously. It’s not something you buy and you get for the rest of your life. You rent it and you lease it every single day, and I’m just trying to make daily deposits and make sure I’m in this house for a long time.”\n\nFinishing with a five-game winning streak put the Vikings (9-8) a half-game behind Green Bay for the last spot even though they were eliminated before taking the field in Week 14.\n\nConsider this: If the Vikings just had better coverage on their kickoff after McCarthy's go-ahead touchdown pass in the final minute in Week 11, when Devin Duvernay's 56-yard return set Chicago up for the walk-off field goal, they would've won that game — and the NFC North title.\n\n“It’s going to sting not being in the tournament for not only our team and the work that they’ve put in, but our fan base and our ownership,” O'Connell said.\n\nThe Vikings still took third in the division on a tiebreaker over Detroit, meaning a road game next season against San Francisco (12-5) instead of Arizona (3-14) from the NFC West and home games against Indianapolis (8-9) instead of Tennessee (3-14) from the AFC South and Washington (5-12) instead of New York (4-13) from the NFC East.\n\nThe Vikings were able to get Justin Jefferson past the 1,000-yard mark for the sixth straight season to start his career, but the fact that he needed all 17 games to do that was ultimately one of many poor statistical reflections on this once-potent offense.\n\nThe Vikings were last in the NFL in turnovers, interceptions and third down conversions and second-to-last in sack percentage.\n\nThe Vikings had another stellar performance under the direction of defensive coordinator Brian Flores, finishing second in red zone touchdown rate and sack percentage and third in the league in yards allowed. They were seventh in points against, one of only two teams in the top 13 in the NFL to miss the playoffs, along with Kansas City.\n\nFlores will again be a candidate for head coach vacancies around the league, and his contract is expiring, too, raising the question about whether he will return. The scene at U.S. Bank Stadium on Sunday felt like a farewell to 14-year veteran safety Harrison Smith, too. Salary cap management will likely force the Vikings to move from one or both of the veteran defensive linemen they signed this season, Jonathan Allen and Javon Hargrave.\n\nThe quarterback search will be complicated by an unfavorable salary cap situation, with the Vikings carrying the second-highest projected overage in the league into the offseason and thus needing to shed multiple important players before they can add new ones. More depth is needed on the offensive line, too, with the future of center Ryan Kelly in doubt after multiple concussions.\n\nIn the draft, they have the 18th pick in the first round and still possess their original second and third-round selections. They currently own five third-day picks and are in line to be awarded mid-round compensatory selections for the departure of free agent quarterbacks Sam Darnold and Daniel Jones last year.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "description": "Şengün's right ankle rolled hard while he was trying to get a rebound in the opening minute of the Rockets' loss Saturday.",
    "fullText": "The Houston Rockets expect to be without All-Star center Alperen Şengün for up to two weeks.\n\nŞengün went down with a right ankle injury very early in the team’s 110-104 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Saturday. While he doesn’t have a specific timeline for his return — the team is planning to evaluate Şengün again in the coming days — head coach Ime Udoka confirmed Monday that Şengün will likely miss up to two weeks.\n\n“We’ll evaluate him at the end of the week,” Udoka said, via Sports Illustrated’s Lachard Binkley. “Need to get the swelling, the pain tolerance down and mobility, but you’re looking at a probably 10-14 days type thing.”\n\n[Get more Rockets news: Houston team feed]\n\nRoughly a minute into the game Saturday at the American Airlines Center, Şengün went up to try to fight for a defensive rebound against Mavericks center Daniel Gafford. As Şengün came down, his right ankle rolled hard. That sent him crashing to the court, where he remained until play stopped at the other end.\n\nThis is the play where Alperen Sengun got hurt, rolling his right ankle when landing on a rebound attempt. https://t.co/vEohvYuD61 pic.twitter.com/VVxGTjqmQh\n\n— ClutchFans (@clutchfans) January 4, 2026\n\nŞengün eventually limped off the court and was quickly ruled out of the game.\n\nHe is in the middle of a career season with the Rockets. The 23-year-old, who made his first All-Star Game last year, has put up a career-high 21.8 points this season while averaging 9 rebounds and 6.5 assists.\n\nWhile this will interrupt his dominant start to the season, and Şengün has a history of ankle injuries, the timeline this time seems relatively minor. If Şengün is out the full two weeks, he'd be back in time for the team’s matchup with the San Antonio Spurs on Jan. 20, meaning he would miss eight games.\n\nThe Rockets enter Monday night’s contest against the Phoenix Suns with a 21-11 record, which has them fifth in the Western Conference standings. Saturday’s loss to the Mavericks snapped a four-game winning streak.",

    "fullText": "The NFL playoff field is set, and it's missing half of the league's top 10 highest-paid quarterbacks in average annual value.\n\nSpotrac made note of that fact on Monday, a day after the dust settled on the NFL's regular season. Of the league's top 10 paid quarterbacks, Josh Allen, Trevor Lawrence, Jordan Love, Brock Purdy and Justin Herbert are all in the postseason.\n\nDak Prescott, Joe Burrow, Tua Tagovailoa, Jared Goff and Lamar Jackson are not.\n\nHalf of the Top 10 Average Paid QBs made the playoffs - half didn't.\n\nDak Prescott ❌\nJosh Allen ✅\nJoe Burrow ❌\nTrevor Lawrence ✅\nJordan Love ✅\nTua Tagovailoa ❌\nJared Goff ❌\nBrock Purdy ✅\nJustin Herbert ✅\nLamar Jackson ❌\n\n— Spotrac (@spotrac) January 5, 2026\n\nWhich got us to thinking. Are teams hamstringing their playoff chances in a salary-capped league by paying premiums for quarterbacks? Is it too difficult in the modern NFL to build a competitive roster around a quarterback playing on a premium salary?\n\nQuarterback is the most important position in football, if not in all of sports. It's difficult to win a Super Bowl without a high-end signal caller, though Super Bowls have been won with Nick Foles, Jeff Hostetler, Jim Plunkett, Brad Johnson and Trent Dilfer.\n\nBut having a Patrick Mahomes, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning or Joe Montana is historically the best ingredient for success. And they cost money.\n\nHere's a look at the salaries of starting quarterbacks for all 32 NFL teams, grouped by whether or not they made the playoffs. Players with a top-10 salary are in bold.\n\nCaleb Williams: $9.9 million (rookie contract)\n\nBryce Young: $9.5 million (rookie contract)\n\nDrake Maye: $9.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nC.J. Stroud: $9.1 million (rookie contract)\n\nBo Nix: $4.7 million (rookie contract)\n\nDak Prescott, Cowboys: $60 million\n\nJoe Burrow, Bengals: $55 million\n\nTua Tagovailoa, Dolphins: $53.1 million\n\nLamar Jackson, Ravens: $52 million\n\nKyler Murray, Cardinals: $46.1 million\n\nKirk Cousins, Falcons: $45 million\n\nPatrick Mahomes, Chiefs: $45 million\n\nGeno Smith, Raiders: $37.5 million\n\nBaker Mayfield, Buccaneers: $33.3 million\n\nJustin Fields, Jets: $20 million\n\nDaniel Jones, Colts: $14 million\n\nCam Ward, Titans: $12.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nJayden Daniels, Commanders: $9.4 million (rookie contract)\n\nJ.J. McCarthy, Vikings: $5.5 million (rookie contract)\n\nJaxson Dart, Giants: $4.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nTyler Shough, Saints: $2.7 million (rookie contract)\n\nShedeur Sanders, Browns: $1.2 million (rookie contract)\n\nIt's notable that five of the 12 playoff quarterbacks are playing on rookie contracts, which are capped by the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nThat cost control is extremely valuable, and optimizing roster construction around rookie quarterback contracts is a proven formula for success. Since the inception of the rookie wage scale in 2011, the Seattle Seahawks with Russell Wilson (2014 season) and the Kansas City Chiefs with Mahomes (2019 season) have navigated the rookie wage scale to Super Bowl victories.\n\nThis, season, the Patriots have an MVP candidate in Maye who's the ninth-highest paid player on the team. Nix playing on a $4.7 million salary has allowed the Broncos to build a Super Bowl contender despite Wilson's disastrous contract remaining on the books.\n\nStroud, meanwhile is a veteran quarterback in his third season who's surrounded by one of the NFL's fiercest defenses. It would not be a surprise to see any of them playing in or winning the Super Bowl in January.\n\nThis is an optimal way to build a Super contender in the short window available to pay quarterbacks on a rookie contract. This, of course, requires hitting successfully on a quarterback in the draft who can lead a team to contention at a young age.\n\nAnd it's also, obviously, not the only path to success. Thirteen of the 15 Super Bowls won since the inception of the rookie wage scale have been won by quarterbacks not playing on a rookie deal.\n\nAt some point, those rookie quarterbacks will be due for extensions. And if you've got a high-end quarterback on your hands who's due to be paid, there's little choice but to pay him. And that doesn't mean that you can't build a successful roster around said quarterback.\n\nYes, half of the top 10 paid quarterbacks will be watching the playoffs from home. But it's a little absurd to suggest that that's an indictment of paying top quarterbacks their market value.\n\nBurrow missed most of the season due to injury. Do the Bengals have also roster construction issues? Absolutely. But that's an issue that's plagued the franchise for pretty much the entirety of its existence under Brown family ownership, with or without a premium quarterback on the roster.\n\nThe Cowboys likewise have roster concerns that limited their upside. Like with the Bengals, it's fairer to take a look at the decades-long management under Jerry Jones (and the defense specifically this year) than point to the $60 million salary of Prescott, who was excellent this season, to explain why the Cowboys aren't in the playoffs.\n\nIt's difficult to argue that the Lions and Ravens didn't build strong rosters around Goff and Jackson. There's talent on both sides of the ball on both teams outside of their quarterbacks. And Jackson was clearly limited by injuries this season, while the Lions were ravaged by injuries of their own.\n\nIn the end, 14 of the league's 32 teams make the playoffs. The Ravens and Lions just missed out, but it wouldn't be a surprise for either or both to return to contention next season.\n\nAnd then there's Tagovailoa. His contract at this point was pretty clearly a mistake. He got benched at the end of the season, and his time in Miami very well may be done. The Dolphins would surely take a do-over on his deal of they could.\n\nBut the Prescott, Jackson, Burrow and Goff deals? There are surely no regrets from their respective franchises. Teams without high-end quarterbacks would certainly jump at the chance to take their contracts on.",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich’s reported long-standing interest in Crystal Palace defender Marc Guéhi could hit a snag: another top European club could beat it to the punch this month.\n\nThe German Rekordmeister had been tipped for contract talks with the English international, who is now in the final six months of his current deal and free to negotiate with other clubs as a free agent. However, a run of injuries to Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City defense has created the possibility of an immediate transfer, according to reporting in the BBC.\n\nManchester City are exploring a move for Marc Guéhi this month, in the wake of defenders Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias suffering injuries. Bayern, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Inter and Atlético are among the European clubs to have shown an interest in signing Guéhi on a free transfer. Liverpool remain heavily interested. It is understood Crystal Palace would consider selling Guéhi this month to avoid the scenario of losing their captain for nothing come the end of the season. Market regulations mean he can sign a pre-agreement with an overseas club from this month [@SamiMokbel_BBC, @BBCSport]\n\nMan City has dropped points again this weekend, this time to Chelsea, and is seeing its campaign to keep the pressure on Arsenal falter. The Gunners sit six points atop the league after 20 matchdays. Guéhi surely would not come cheap, but the incentives are aligning for all parties involved — and Bayern is in no position at the moment to throw in a bid. If Pep wants Guéhi, it is hard to see this not happening.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

Now, after destabilising the Blues, United could land their ex-manager in one fell swoop.\n\nIt looked a certainty that the ex-Leicester City boss was heading back to Manchester City to replace Guardiola ahead of next summer, but United could offer an immediate job opportunity.\n\nFeature image Clive Mason via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Carlie Irsay-Gordon liked what she saw during her first 10 games as the Indianapolis Colts' co-owner.\n\nQuarterback Daniel Jones and running back Jonathan Taylor played at MVP levels, coach Shane Steichen's offense operated at a historically efficient clip and general manager Chris Ballard pulled the trigger on a midseason trade to fill the team's most glaring need.\n\nThen Jones tried to play through a fractured lower left leg, suffered a torn right Achilles tendon and the season unraveled quickly as a season-ending seven-game losing streak knocked Indy (8-9) out of the playoffs again.\n\nYet in her most significant move since taking over the franchise's day-to-day operations from her late father, Jim, Irsay-Gordon ignored the urge — and the calls from some fans — to fire Ballard and Steichen and instead decided to give them another chance to replicate their early season success.\n\n“We have been very clear with Chris and Shane that giving them another opportunity means that the sense of urgency for them to deliver and perform has never been higher,” Irsay-Gordon said. “Chris and Shane are both capable of facing this challenge head on and finding a way to achieve the results our fans deserve, which is winning games, getting to the postseason and ultimately winning championships.”\n\nIt might have been easier for Irsay-Gordon to explain if she moved on from Ballard, who has two playoff appearances and one postseason win in his nine-year tenure, or Steichen, who's 25-26 in three seasons and has never made it to the playoffs. Or perhaps both following the historic second-half collapse.\n\nIndy became the first team since the 1995 Oakland Raiders and just the sixth since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger to start 8-2 and not make the postseason.\n\nIrsay-Gordon blames injuries for the second-half failures.\n\nIn addition to Jones, the Colts lost two-time All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner for most of the final five games because of a strained calf, 2023 All-Pro cornerback Charvarius Ward for most of the second half because of two concussions and three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle DeForest Buckner for six of the final seven games because of a neck injury. The result: Indy's skid included four losses by six or fewer points.\n\nAnd for that reason, Irsay-Gordon didn't see the need to start over in 2026. She said she made that decision last week.\n\n“What we saw in that first half, we were on a record pace, dominating offensively,” she said. “I think we just have to be able to face adversity better, and I believe in the team. I believe in the team and hope to stay healthier next season.”\n\nBallard again finds himself entering an offseason dealing with questions about the sport's most important position.\n\nBefore the injury, Jones was expected to cash in on a comeback season with a big-dollar contract. Instead, he'll enter free agency for a second straight season dealing with questions about his injury history and how quickly he'll return to the field — likely decreasing his price tag.\n\n“I'd love to be back here,” Jones said. “I think it's a great organization and I've enjoyed being here. Obviously, there's a business side to it and I understand that, but I've really enjoyed being around these people.”\n\nSteichen and Ballard also must decide what to do with the oft-injured Anthony Richardson, the No. 4 pick in the 2023 draft, who lost the starting job in training camp and wasn't even active after mid-October after fracturing the orbital bone near his eye in a bizarre pregame accident.\n\nIn his first two seasons, receiver Alec Pierce struggled to make a consistent impact. The last two years, he has produced the highest per-catch average among the league's qualifiers.\n\nNow the soon-to-be free agency is likely to cash in. Pierce had 47 catches, his first 1,000-yard season (1,003) for a 21.3-yard average with six TDs this season while establishing himself as a favorite for three starting quarterbacks — Jones, 44-year-old Philip Rivers and rookie Riley Leonard.\n\n“I guess it's more like being recruited because you actually have a say in it now,” Pierce said. “It's ultimately my decision.”\n\nWard had three concussions in his first season with Indy, and the second — suffered in a pregame collision with tight end Drew Ogletree — prompted Ward to contemplate retirement.\n\nHe might be going through that process again after finishing the season on injured reserve with his third concussion.\n\n“I've got to talk to my family,” Ward said. “If I walk away, I feel like I'd be happy. I'd have won a Super Bowl, made a whole lot of money, made the Pro Bowl, made All-Pro. I did everything I wanted to. So I feel like if I walk away, I won't regret it. I'm good.\"\n\nIrsay-Gordon made it clear the sense of urgency next year is even higher next season and her comment is likely to resonate throughout the offseason as Ballard contemplates future moves. Steichen said he'll contemplate what went wrong late in games, late in the season and how he can get the Colts back to the postseason.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

Tagovailoa's 1,660 passing yards were his fewest since 2021 and his 15 interceptions were a career high.\n\nEwers will be part of the competition for the job in 2026. It remains to be seen whether Tagovailoa will be, though it seems likely the Dolphins will part ways.\n\nHe is owed $54 million guaranteed in 2026. The Dolphins could release him with a post-June 1 designation at the start of the new league year to split his $99.2 million cap charge over two years.\n\n\"In 2026, I think there will be competition for our starting quarterback,\" McDaniel said. \"What that is and how it looks, that remains to be seen.

    "fullText": "Patriots quarterback Drake Maye had an impressive regular season and is in the running for MVP, which left former New England wide receiver Julian Edelman naming his favorite thing about Maye’s game.\n\n“His attitude,” Edelman said Monday on “The Herd”. “Just talking to people over there, everyone just talks about how he is so hungry to be coached and to learn, and it translates to how he is playing. He looks so confident. He makes it look so easy.”\n\nMaye is just in his second season in the NFL, but he plays like a seasoned veteran every week. Although he is still young and lacks postseason experience, the Patriots shouldn’t be counted out in the playoffs.\n\nThe AFC is lacking a lot of veteran quarterbacks in this postseason, with Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow sitting at home. Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen could be the quarterback to beat in the AFC. However, Maye already beat him once this season and should’ve beaten him again.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Maye performs in the postseason. If he plays as he did throughout the season, there’s a strong chance that New England could be on its way to the Super Bowl.\n\nDrake Maye Makes His Case For Why He Deserves To Be NFL MVP",

    "description": "A peculiar stat could unlock an Andrew Mangiapane trade for the Oilers. Other teams might see his struggles as opportunity.",
    "fullText": "Trade speculation around Andrew Mangiapane is heating up, and Elliotte Friedman believes it’s only a matter of time before the Edmonton Oilers move the winger. While the fit in Edmonton hasn’t worked as hoped, Friedman suggests a deal is very doable based on analytics, contract value, and league-wide interest.\n\nSpeaking on 32 Thoughts, Friedman noted Mangiapane’s poor PDO — often viewed as a “luck” stat — could actually help the Oilers. Friedman wonders whether another team might see Mangiapane’s struggles as more circumstantial than skill-related, suggesting that another organization could view him as a bounce-back candidate. With one year remaining at $3.6 million, Friedman doesn’t expect Edmonton to have much trouble finding a trade partner.\n\nTo date, the Ducks have been linked, but new names recently popped up on Monday, suggesting the Detroit Red Wings and Winnipeg Jets might also be a fit.\n\nFriedman compared Mangiapane’s situation to Mason Marchment, a player who struggled in one stop before thriving elsewhere. Sometimes players need a change of scenery, and Mangiapane has a proven scoring history that remains valuable.\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks have surfaced as a possible landing spot, largely due to their cap flexibility and recent struggles. Friedman believes Anaheim may look to add or retain veterans, especially with Frank Vatrano sidelined long-term, to help stabilize a young roster.\n\nWith that in mind, Friedman poured cold water on rumors involving Ryan Strome coming back to Edmonton. Strome earns roughly $1.5 million more than Mangiapane, and the Oilers don’t have the cap space to make that work. More importantly, Strome isn’t the type of bottom-six, role-accepting player Edmonton is targeting.\n\nInstead, the Oilers are reportedly seeking a grinder-type forward willing to play limited minutes and embrace a depth role — something Mangiapane has been trending toward but seems less-than-thrilled about doing. It's reportedly why he's open to a trade in the first place -- to go where there is more opportunity to play a more prominent role.\n\nToronto has also been loosely connected due to Brad Treliving’s history with Mangiapane, but Friedman doesn’t see that as a realistic option.\n\nBottom line: Edmonton will find a landing spot for Mangiapane. The only question is where and when.\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Edmonton Oilers team site to never miss the latest news, game-day coverage, and more.   Add us to your Google News favourites, and never miss a story.",

    "fullText": "Former Baylor redshirt sophomore defensive tackle DK Kalu has committed to the Florida Gators.\n\nKalu announced his decision on Monday, Jan. 5, joining former teammate DJ Coleman in moving from Baylor to Florida. A consensus three-star prospect out of high school, Kalu redshirted in 2023 after not seeing any action as a true freshman. He played three games as a reserve defensive lineman in 2024, making one start and recording one solo tackle.\n\nIn 2025, Kalu played 281 total snaps, earning a 59.7 offensive grade, a 61.5 run-defense grade, a 68.4 tackling grade (49th among Big 12 defensive linemen) and a 54.0 pass-rushing grade from Pro Football Focus. He played in nine games, starting six, recording 11 total tackles (four solo) and 0.5 tackles for a loss.\n\n247Sports ranks Kalu No. 705 overall and No. 48 among defensive linemen in the 2026 transfer cycle. On3 has him at No. 684 and No. 75, respectively.\n\nHe was on campus this weekend for an official visit.\n\nCommitted 🐊 pic.twitter.com/WU9S8wrBkV\n\n— DK Kalu🇳🇬🤴🏿 (@dk_kalu) January 5, 2026\n\nFollowing transfer portal losses, including starter Michai Boireau, the Gators have five defensive linemen in 2026. Redshirt senior Jamari Lyons has starting potential, as does redshirt junior Brendan Bett. Kalu is a depth addition, but he will compete for a starting job. Florida also returns Joseph Mbatchou and Jeramiah McCloud, and freshman Kendall Guervil recently signed as well.\n\nThe dilemma is that Boireau primarily played nose tackle for Florida last year, which none of the names mentioned above have much experience at. Lyons could step into that role, opening the door for Bett and Kalu to rotate alongside him. Florida could also add another defensive lineman from the transfer portal.\n\nAt 6-foot-4-inches, 309 pounds, Kalu provides size and depth to the position room.\n\nKalu is the fourth official transfer portal addition of the 2026 cycle for Florida, following Baylor safety DJ Coleman, James Madison tight end Lacota Dippre and Georgia Tech wide receiver Bailey Stockton.\n\nFlorida is also expected to land Georgia Tech quarterback Aaron Philo and interior offensive lineman Harrison Moore.\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida Gators football earns commitment from Baylor DT DK Kalu",

Given the fact that star Celtics forward Jaylen Brown has been playing at the level of a bona fide Most Valuable Player candidate so far this season and that Boston has defied the odds alongside him to claw their way up to the Eastern Conference's third-place spot, there is a very strong case that they ought to be on the hunt for some talent to add to the roster.\n\nThe frontcourt stands out in particular as an area of need, with the Celtics needing a little bit of veteran experience and a different style of big man play to put next to blossoming young big man Neemias Queta.

    "fullText": "Well, there'll be at least one Carolina Panthers legend in the building for Saturday's wild-card matchup against the Los Angeles Rams. The thing is, he'll be on the job.\n\nAs revealed on Monday, franchise great Greg Olsen will be on FOX's broadcast team for this weekend's playoff game from Bank of America Stadium. Olsen, as usual, will be joined by play-by-by commentator Joe Davis and sideline reporter Pam Oliver.\n\nBefore becoming an Emmy Award-winning color analyst, Olsen played nine of his 14 NFL seasons with the Panthers. The former three-time Pro Bowl tight end finished up as the Carolina's third all-time leading pass catcher, amassing 6,463 receiving yards between 2011 and 2019.\n\nOlsen, perhaps fittingly, was a part of the Panthers' last playoff team—back in 2017. That trip ended in a wild-card round loss to the New Orleans Saints, where Olsen reeled in eight catches for 107 yards and a touchdown.\n\nThis will mark Olsen's fourth time covering the Panthers this season, with his last assignment coming in the team's Week 9 victory over the Green Bay Packers.\n\nFollow @ThePanthersWire on Twitter/X for more Panthers content.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Panthers Wire: Announcers for Panthers' wild-card game vs. Rams are revealed",

    "fullText": "Transfer Portal season may be in full swing, but high school football recruiting won’t be slowing down this winter, either.\n\nAttention has nearly turned in full to the 2027 cycle. All-American games will round out this month and then it’ll be on to camp season. Visits will be taken and early commitments will be made. Looking at the top EDGE prospects in the cycle, many are already off the board.\n\nAs of Jan. 5, eight of the 32 blue-chip EDGE recruits in the 2027 cycle are committed. That includes the No. 2 prospect at the position in five-star David Jacobs, who made a last-second pivot to Ohio State on Dec. 29. Below is a look at the top committed EDGEs early on in the cycle.\n\nSchool: Blessed Trinity Catholic (Ga.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 10 NATL. (No. 2 EDGE)\n\nOn his commitment: “I love everything about Ohio State,” Jacobs told Rivals’ Chad Simmons. “I was there for the Rutgers game and that visit really blew me away. The coaches, the players, and the atmosphere made a big impact on me. I knew about Ohio State and had been following them for a long time, but that visit showed me a lot.”\n\nSchool: Irmo (S.C.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 34 NATL. (No. 5 EDGE)\n\nOn his commitment: “Coach (Sterling) Lucas is a coach I trust and believe in,” Bryant told Simmons. “South Carolina wasn’t one of my first offers, but he was recruiting me before that. He started recruiting me early, and he’s like family. He’s easy to talk to, we have a nice relationship, and he’s always been a coach I knew I would love to play for … LSU has a storied history. They’ve always developed players, and it’s a good school with a lot of success.”\n\nSchool: Vigor (Ala.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 88 NATL. (No. 10 EDGE)\n\nOn his commitment: “I’m still open with my options,” Garror told Rivals’ Adam Gorney in November. “Just waiting it out and talking with everyone that I can.”\n\nVia Gorney: “There are three main contenders working to flip the Mobile Vigor standout with Auburn, Florida State and Texas A&M being the biggest threats to Alabama in his recruitment.”\n\nSchool: Cy Falls (Texas)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 115 NATL. (No. 17 EDGE)\n\nOn his commitment: “After the first and second visits, I got to really talk to Coach Elko and the whole staff and they really expressed how much they wanted me,” McCarty told Rivals’ Sam Spiegelman. “Coach (Jay) Bateman, Coach (Sean) Spencer and Coach Tony (Jerod-Eddie) all played roles. They just pushed the hardest and they know that I’m a family person — and they got the closest with my family.”\n\nSchool: Wayzata (Minn.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 119 NATL. (No. 18 EDGE)\n\nScout’s Take: “Eli Diane is one that we really ranked high in our initial rankings and we continue to like what we see from the Minnesota commit. A lot of the tools we like to see from prospects at his position, we could see where he could continue to grow and become a defensive lineman long-term. A ton of developmental upside there, we like the film and feel like he’s just scratching the surface on his potential.”\n\nSchool: Muskegon (Mich.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 126 NATL. (No. 19 EDGE)\n\nOn Michigan: “We went to a lot of colleges and, when we got there, it was different,” Kitchen told The Wolverine’s Ethan McDowell in September. “Everybody was huge. They were really hitting out there, really putting in work and it was just different.”\n\nSchool: Ridgeline (Utah)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 135 NATL. (No. 20 EDGE)\n\nOn his commitment: “It was in the back of my head for the last month-and-a-half with the communication they’ve had and just seeing their defense and how crazy it is these past few years,” Jones told Rivals’ Adam Gorney. “Looking back on the coaches and how they develop kids and how I could trust myself in their hands to get me to where I want to be.”\n\nSchool: Grimsley (N.C.)\nRivals Industry Ranking: No. 282 NATL. (No. 28 EDGE)\n\nRogers on new VT head coach James Franklin: “It changes some things for me,” he told Rivals. “I’m sure they will reach back out and Blacksburg is still my first love. I would love it make it work again with them if possible … “It’s definitely a great hire. I’ve heard nothing but great things about him.”",

    "description": "Mike McDaniel's job as head coach of the Miami Dolphins appears to be safe for now.  “Listen, I was hired here to not just be the head coach,” McDaniel said Monday, a day after the Dolphins were blown out at New England to finish the season 7-10.  “I was hired to return a storied franchise to winning regular-season games, playoff games and Super Bowls.”",
    "fullText": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Mike McDaniel's job as head coach of the Miami Dolphins appears to be safe for now. He knows that will only remain true if he produces the results he was hired for in 2022.\n\n“Listen, I was hired here to not just be the head coach,” McDaniel said Monday, a day after the Dolphins were blown out at New England to finish the season 7-10. “I was hired to return a storied franchise to winning regular-season games, playoff games and Super Bowls.”\n\nThe latter two have not happened. And after another season of failed expectations in which the Dolphins missed the playoffs for the second straight year, they enter another offseason of uncertainty, starting with who'll be their next general manager and starting quarterback in 2026.\n\nMcDaniel, who is 35-32 in four seasons as Miami's coach, indicated Monday that he will be part of the decision-making in both processes. Though he did not specifically say he has been told by Dolphins ownership that he's returning next season — nor has the team made an official announcement — McDaniel said he has spoken with owner Stephen Ross.\n\n“I know one thing, every day that I'm employed by the Miami Dolphins as the head coach, I'm solely focused on doing what I was hired here to do,” McDaniel said. \"Eventually, like everybody else in this league, you're not entitled to this position. If I'm not able to win regular-season games, playoff games and Super Bowls, eventually the job won't be mine.\n\n\"And I think that is the nature of the NFL, and shame on you if you expect anything else.”\n\nThe Dolphins parted ways with longtime general manager Chris Grier on Oct. 31 following a loss to the Baltimore Ravens that dropped them to 2-7. Dolphins senior personnel executive Champ Kelly has been Miami's interim GM since, and the team recently brought in Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman to aid in its GM search.\n\n“I'm going to be a part of the (interview) process,” McDaniel said, “and beyond that, I think the main objective and what everyone's counting on is that we have a cohesive crew of people that are working in the same direction. I'm happy to support all of that. It's not my decision to make, nor do I think that would be an intelligent way to go about business.”\n\nBeyond front office decisions, the Dolphins will need to figure out what they're going to do at quarterback after Tua Tagovailoa was benched for the final three games of the season because of poor play.\n\nMcDaniel said Monday there will be a quarterback competition to determine Miami's 2026 starter, and he will meet with Tagovailoa on Tuesday morning to discuss the season.\n\nTagovailoa threw for 2,660 yards with 20 touchdowns but showed a stark decline in accuracy and mobility, just one season after signing a four-year, $212.4 million extension in July 2024. He finished second in the NFL with 15 interceptions, which was a career high.\n\nTagovailoa is guaranteed $54 million for 2026, and the Dolphins would incur significant hits to the salary cap by releasing him. Releasing him next year would result in a $99 million dead cap charge. If the move is designated as a post-June 1 release, those charges are split over two years, with $67.4 million allocated to the 2026 cap and $31.8 million in 2027.\n\nRookie seventh-round pick Quinn Ewers went 1-2 as Miami's starter but didn't separate himself as the clear No. 1 option for 2026, throwing for 569 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions. And the Dolphins recently signed rookie sixth-round pick Cam Miller off the Raiders' practice squad to join the competition.\n\nDespite a second consecutive losing season that ensured the Dolphins' 25-year playoff win drought will remain intact, McDaniel apparently has the backing of Ross. And the two will meet again later this week to discuss the organization's future.\n\n“We both share the same sentiment that we’re not where we want to be,” McDaniel said. \"We’re not just dismissing this season as, ‘Oops, we’ll try again.’”\n\nThe Dolphins will also need to figure out what to do with the contract of star receiver Tyreek Hill, who'll be 32 in March and suffered a severe knee injury in September.\n\nThe Dolphins acquired Hill in a trade with Kansas City in 2022 and gave him a $120 million, four-year contract extension, which he restructured in 2024 and runs through 2026.\n\nHill is owed about $29.9 million next season, though $11 million of that becomes guaranteed after the start of the new league year, which is also when the Dolphins will have to pay him a $5 million roster bonus.\n\nHill would carry a $51.9 million cap hit if the Dolphins release him.\n\nMcDaniel doesn't believe the organization is heading toward a complete rebuild. Regardless, the new GM will have several core pieces to build around, including third-year running back De'Von Achane, second-year left tackle Patrick Paul, veteran center Aaron Brewer and veteran linebacker Jordyn Brooks.\n\nAchane had one of the best seasons of any Dolphins running back, and Brooks, who said Monday he hopes to remain in Miami the rest of his career, led the NFL with 183 tackles.\n\nA couple players set to hit free agency have expressed interest in returning to to the Dolphins, including veteran tight end Darren Waller.\n\nWaller came out of retirement to play in Miami on a one-year deal last July but was limited to nine games because of injuries. Still, Waller caught 24 of 34 targets for six touchdowns. The 33-year-old said he's undecided on whether he will return to football next season, but said he will make a decision soon and is considering returning to Miami.\n\nOnce the new GM is in place, the Dolphins will likely need to get an earlier start on free agency than they did last season. They also have the 11th pick in the NFL draft.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "Monday’s NBA and NHL slates present plenty of betting opportunities as teams hit midseason form and trends across both leagues turn into dependable indicators. As January rolls on, separation on the hardwood and ice sharpens betting lines, creating clearer opportunities at the window.  Here are tonight’s best bets brought to you by BetOnline.ag. All new players get a 50% welcome bonus and up to $250 in free bets.\n\nRundown: The Los Angeles Kings (17-14-9) wrap up a two-game home set against the Minnesota Wild (25-10-8) on Monday night at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nLos Angeles enters tonight’s contest riding the momentum of a 5-4 shootout win over Minnesota on Saturday, a result that stood out given the Kings’ season-long offensive struggles. Ranked 31st in goals per game, Los Angeles capitalized on its chances against a Wild team that had won eight of its previous 10 contests, with Adrian Kempe recording a two-point night to spark the breakthrough performance. While the final score reflected a wide-open game, much of the damage came from situational lapses rather than sustained offensive pressure.\n\nDespite Saturday’s nine-goal outburst, both teams continue to lean on structure and goal prevention as their foundation. The Kings rank third in the NHL in goals allowed per game (2.65), relying on disciplined defensive-zone coverage and limiting high-danger chances, a style that has pushed 22 of their 40 games (55%) below the posted total. Minnesota enters with a similar identity, excelling at controlling tempo and suppressing second-chance opportunities.\n\nExpect a sharper, more methodical approach in the rematch, with both teams tightening neutral-zone play and limiting rush chances. With goaltending and defensive structure likely to dictate the pace, this matchup sets up for a lower-scoring outcome this time around.\n\nRundown: The Los Angeles Clippers (12-22) close out a five-game homestand on Monday night as they host the Golden State Warriors (19-17) at Intuit Dome.\n\nLos Angeles looks to rebound after a 31-point blowout loss to Boston that snapped its six-game winning streak and dropped the Clippers back to 10 games under the .500 mark. Jaylen Brown’s 50-point outburst exposed some of Los Angeles’ season-long offensive issues, as the Clippers continue to rank near the bottom of the league in scoring efficiency. Despite the uneven record, Los Angeles’ recent surge has translated to the betting market, covering seven of its last 10 games and posting an 8–8 record against the spread when listed as underdogs of 2.5 points or more. Kawhi Leonard and James Harden will be tasked with generating efficient looks against a Golden State defense that ranks seventh in the NBA in points allowed (113.9 per game) and does a strong job limiting perimeter scoring.\n\nOn the other side, Golden State enters playing its best basketball in weeks, winning six of its last eight contests behind the continued brilliance of Stephen Curry. At 37 years old, Curry remains the engine of the Warriors’ offense, averaging 28.8 points per game, ninth-highest in the league. While Golden State’s recent success has boosted its position in the standings, it has not consistently carried over to the betting window, as the Warriors have covered just three of their last 10 games and sit 15-21 ATS on the season. As favorites of 2.5 points or more, Golden State has struggled to separate, owning a 9-14-1 ATS record in those spots.\n\nExpect Los Angeles to lean on home-court energy and create opportunities in key spots, keeping this matchup within a single possession as the final buzzer sounds.",

    "description": "NVIDIA today kickstarted the next generation of AI with the launch of the NVIDIA Rubin platform, comprising six new chips designed to deliver one incredible AI supercomputer.",
    "fullText": "CES—NVIDIA today kickstarted the next generation of AI with the launch of the NVIDIA Rubin platform, comprising six new chips designed to deliver one incredible AI supercomputer. NVIDIA Rubin sets a new standard for building, deploying and securing the world’s largest and most advanced AI systems at the lowest cost to accelerate mainstream AI adoption.\n\nThe Rubin platform uses extreme codesign across the six chips — the NVIDIA Vera CPU, NVIDIA Rubin GPU, NVIDIA NVLink™ 6 Switch, NVIDIA ConnectX®-9 SuperNIC, NVIDIA BlueField®-4 DPU and NVIDIA Spectrum™-6 Ethernet Switch — to slash training time and inference token costs.\n\n“Rubin arrives at exactly the right moment, as AI computing demand for both training and inference is going through the roof,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With our annual cadence of delivering a new generation of AI supercomputers — and extreme codesign across six new chips — Rubin takes a giant leap toward the next frontier of AI.”\n\nNamed for Vera Florence Cooper Rubin — the trailblazing American astronomer whose discoveries transformed humanity’s understanding of the universe — the Rubin platform features the NVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL72 rack-scale solution and the NVIDIA HGX Rubin NVL8 system.\n\nThe Rubin platform introduces five innovations, including the latest generations of NVIDIA NVLink interconnect technology, Transformer Engine, Confidential Computing and RAS Engine, as well as the NVIDIA Vera CPU. These breakthroughs will accelerate agentic AI, advanced reasoning and massive-scale mixture-of-experts (MoE) model inference at up to 10x lower cost per token of the NVIDIA Blackwell platform. Compared with its predecessor, the NVIDIA Rubin platform trains MoE models with 4x fewer GPUs to accelerate AI adoption.\n\nBroad Ecosystem Support\n\nAmong the world’s leading AI labs, cloud service providers, computer makers and startups expected to adopt Rubin are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Anthropic, Black Forest Labs, Cisco, Cohere, CoreWeave, Cursor, Dell Technologies, Google, Harvey, HPE, Lambda, Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, Nebius, Nscale, OpenAI, OpenEvidence, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), Perplexity, Runway, Supermicro, Thinking Machines Lab and xAI.\n\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI: “Intelligence scales with compute. When we add more compute, models get more capable, solve harder problems and make a bigger impact for people. The NVIDIA Rubin platform helps us keep scaling this progress so advanced intelligence benefits everyone.”\n\nDario Amodei, cofounder and CEO of Anthropic: “The efficiency gains in the NVIDIA Rubin platform represent the kind of infrastructure progress that enables longer memory, better reasoning and more reliable outputs. Our collaboration with NVIDIA helps power our safety research and our frontier models.”\n\nMark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Meta: “NVIDIA’s Rubin platform promises to deliver the step-change in performance and efficiency required to deploy the most advanced models to billions of people.”\n\nElon Musk, founder and CEO of xAI: “💚🎉🚀 🤖NVIDIA Rubin will be a rocket engine for AI. If you want to train and deploy frontier models at scale, this is the infrastructure you use — and Rubin will remind the world that NVIDIA is the gold standard.💚🎉🚀 🤖”\n\nSatya Nadella, executive chairman and CEO of Microsoft: “We are building the world’s most powerful AI superfactories to serve any workload, anywhere, with maximum performance and efficiency. With the addition of NVIDIA Vera Rubin GPUs, we will empower developers and organizations to create, reason and scale in entirely new ways.”\n\nMike Intrator, cofounder and CEO of CoreWeave: “We built CoreWeave to help pioneers accelerate their innovations with the unmatched performance of our purpose-built AI platform, matching the right technology to the right workloads as they evolve. The NVIDIA Rubin platform represents an important advancement for reasoning, agentic and large-scale inference workloads, and we’re excited to add it to our platform. With CoreWeave Mission Control as the operating standard, we can integrate new capabilities quickly and run them reliably at production scale, working in close partnership with NVIDIA.”\n\nMatt Garman, CEO of AWS: “AWS and NVIDIA have been driving cloud AI innovation together for more than 15 years. The NVIDIA Rubin platform on AWS represents our continued commitment to delivering cutting-edge AI infrastructure that gives customers unmatched choice and flexibility. By combining NVIDIA’s advanced AI technology with AWS’s proven scale, security and comprehensive AI services, customers can build, train and deploy their most demanding AI applications faster and more cost effectively — accelerating their path from experimentation to production at any scale.”\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet: “We are proud of our deep and long-standing relationship with NVIDIA. To meet the substantial customer demand we see for NVIDIA GPUs, we are focused on providing the best possible environment for their hardware on Google Cloud. Our collaboration will continue as we bring the impressive capabilities of the Rubin platform to our customers, offering them the scale and performance needed to advance the boundaries of AI.”\n\nClay Magouyrk, CEO of Oracle: “Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is a hyperscale cloud built for the highest performance, and together with NVIDIA, we’re pushing the boundaries of what customers can build and scale with AI. With gigascale AI factories powered by the NVIDIA Vera Rubin architecture, OCI is giving customers the infrastructure foundation they need to push the limits of model training, inference and real-world AI impact.”\n\nMichael Dell, chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies: “The NVIDIA Rubin platform represents a major leap forward in AI infrastructure. By integrating Rubin into the Dell AI Factory with NVIDIA, we’re building infrastructure that can handle massive token volumes and multistep reasoning while delivering the performance and resiliency that enterprises and neoclouds need to deploy AI at scale.”\n\nAntonio Neri, president and CEO of HPE: “AI is reshaping not just workloads but the very foundations of IT, requiring us to reimagine every layer of infrastructure from the network to the compute. With the NVIDIA Vera Rubin platform, HPE is building the next generation of secure, AI-native infrastructure, turning data into intelligence and enabling enterprises to become true AI factories.”\n\nYuanqing Yang, chairman and CEO of Lenovo: “Lenovo is embracing the next-generation NVIDIA Rubin platform, leveraging our Neptune liquid-cooling solution as well as our global scale, manufacturing efficiency and service reach, to help enterprises build AI factories that serve as intelligent, accelerated engines for insight and innovation. Together, we’re architecting an AI-driven future where efficient, secure AI becomes the standard for every organization.”\n\nEngineered to Scale Intelligence\n\nAgentic AI and reasoning models, along with state-of-the-art video generation workloads, are redefining the limits of computation. Multistep problem-solving requires models to process, reason and act across long sequences of tokens. Designed to serve the demands of complex AI workloads, the Rubin platform’s five groundbreaking technologies include:\n\nAI-Native Storage and Secure, Software-Defined Infrastructure\n\nNVIDIA Rubin introduces NVIDIA Inference Context Memory Storage Platform, a new class of AI-native storage infrastructure designed to scale inference context at gigascale.\n\nAs AI factories increasingly adopt bare-metal and multi-tenant deployment models, maintaining strong infrastructure control and isolation becomes essential.\n\nBlueField-4 also introduces Advanced Secure Trusted Resource Architecture, or ASTRA, a system-level trust architecture that gives AI infrastructure builders a single, trusted control point to securely provision, isolate and operate large-scale AI environments without compromising performance.\n\nWith AI applications evolving toward multi-turn agentic reasoning, AI-native organizations must manage and share far larger volumes of inference context across users, sessions and services.\n\nDifferent Forms for Different Workloads\n\nNVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL72 offers a unified, secure system that combines 72 NVIDIA Rubin GPUs, 36 NVIDIA Vera CPUs, NVIDIA NVLink 6, NVIDIA ConnectX-9 SuperNICs and NVIDIA BlueField-4 DPUs.\n\nNVIDIA will also offer the NVIDIA HGX Rubin NVL8 platform, a server board that links eight Rubin GPUs through NVLink to support x86-based generative AI platforms. The HGX Rubin NVL8 platform accelerates training, inference and scientific computing for AI and high-performance computing workloads.\n\nNVIDIA DGX SuperPOD™ serves as a reference for deploying Rubin-based systems at scale, integrating either NVIDIA DGX Vera Rubin NVL72 or DGX Rubin NVL8 systems with NVIDIA BlueField-4 DPUs, NVIDIA ConnectX-9 SuperNICs, NVIDIA InfiniBand networking and NVIDIA Mission Control™ software.\n\nNext-Generation Ethernet Networking\n\nAdvanced Ethernet networking and storage are components of AI infrastructure critical to keeping data centers running at full speed, improving performance and efficiency, and lowering costs.\n\nNVIDIA Spectrum-6 Ethernet is the next generation of Ethernet for AI networking, built to scale Rubin-based AI factories with higher efficiency and greater resilience, and enabled by 200G SerDes communication circuitry, co-packaged optics and AI-optimized fabrics.\n\nBuilt on the Spectrum-6 architecture, Spectrum-X Ethernet Photonics co-packaged optical switch systems deliver 10x greater reliability and 5x longer uptime for AI applications while achieving 5x better power efficiency, maximizing performance per watt compared with traditional methods. Spectrum-XGS Ethernet technology, part of the Spectrum-X Ethernet platform, enables facilities separated by hundreds of kilometers and more to function as a single AI environment.\n\nTogether, these innovations define the next generation of the NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet platform, engineered with extreme codesign for Rubin to enable massive-scale AI factories and pave the way for future million-GPU environments.\n\nRubin Readiness\n\nNVIDIA Rubin is in full production, and Rubin-based products will be available from partners the second half of 2026.\n\nAmong the first cloud providers to deploy Vera Rubin-based instances in 2026 will be AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft and OCI, as well as NVIDIA Cloud Partners CoreWeave, Lambda, Nebius and Nscale.\n\nMicrosoft will deploy NVIDIA Vera Rubin NVL72 rack-scale systems as part of next-generation AI data centers, including future Fairwater AI superfactory sites.\n\nDesigned to deliver unprecedented efficiency and performance for training and inference workloads, the Rubin platform will provide the foundation for Microsoft’s next-generation cloud AI capabilities. Microsoft Azure will offer a tightly optimized platform enabling customers to accelerate innovation across enterprise, research and consumer applications.\n\nCoreWeave will integrate NVIDIA Rubin-based systems into its AI cloud platform beginning in the second half of 2026. CoreWeave is built to operate multiple architectures side by side, enabling customers to bring Rubin into their environments, where it will deliver the greatest impact across training, inference and agentic workloads.\n\nTogether with NVIDIA, CoreWeave will help AI pioneers take advantage of Rubin’s advancements in reasoning and MoE models, while continuing to deliver the performance, operational reliability and scale required for production AI across the full lifecycle with CoreWeave Mission Control.\n\nIn addition, Cisco, Dell, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro are expected to deliver a wide range of servers based on Rubin products.\n\nAI labs including Anthropic, Black Forest, Cohere, Cursor, Harvey, Meta, Mistral AI, OpenAI, OpenEvidence, Perplexity, Runway, Thinking Machines Lab and xAI are looking to the NVIDIA Rubin platform to train larger, more capable models and to serve long-context, multimodal systems at lower latency and cost than with prior GPU generations.\n\nInfrastructure software and storage partners AIC, Canonical, Cloudian, DDN, Dell, HPE, Hitachi Vantara, IBM, NetApp, Nutanix, Pure Storage, Supermicro, SUSE, VAST Data and WEKA are working with NVIDIA to design next-generation platforms for Rubin infrastructure.\n\nThe Rubin platform marks NVIDIA’s third-generation rack-scale architecture, with more than 80 NVIDIA MGX™ ecosystem partners.\n\nTo unlock this density, Red Hat today announced an expanded collaboration with NVIDIA to deliver a complete AI stack optimized for the NVIDIA Rubin platform with Red Hat’s hybrid cloud portfolio, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat AI. These solutions are used by the vast majority of Fortune Global 500 companies.\n\nLearn more by watching NVIDIA Live at CES and reading the “Inside Vera Rubin” technical blog.",

    "description": "Many are celebrating the ouster of a brutal dictator, but the Maduro regime may survive the loss of Maduro.",
    "fullText": "On my last visit to Venezuela in 2019, I saw children starving because of the kleptocracy overseen by President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nIn the impoverished, violent slum of La Dolorita in Caracas, I met an emaciated 5-year-old girl, Alaska. Her mother told me that Alaska, weighing just 26 pounds and near death from malnutrition, had been turned away from four hospitals because no beds were available.\n\nAnother mother wept as she said that her 8-month-old baby girl, Daisha, died after three hospitals had turned the girl away.\n\nMany Americans don’t understand how brutal and incompetent Maduro’s dictatorship was, and how much suffering the population endured. Government thugs tortured, raped and killed with impunity, and ordinary citizens lost their children to tragic misrule — even as regime officials lived lavishly and ostentatiously (such as overindulging in expensive whiskeys at the hotel where I last stayed).\n\nVenezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world, and back in 2000 it had a lower child mortality rate than Peru, Brazil and Colombia; now, the rate is higher in Venezuela than in any of those countries, which means thousands of children die unnecessarily each year. It’s true that U.S. sanctions compounded the suffering (and I argued against such general sanctions), but the central reason was the venality and ineptitude of the regime. So of course many Venezuelans are celebrating when they see Maduro fall.\n\n“We are free,” a Venezuelan woman in Chile told Reuters after Maduro’s removal on Saturday. “We are all happy that the dictatorship has fallen and that we have a free country.”\n\nI understand the giddiness, but I worry the triumphalism may be overdone.\n\nTrue, Maduro was a disaster for Venezuela and for the entire region, with nearly eight million refugees fleeing the country. Yes, he appears to have stolen the 2024 election.\n\nBut President Trump’s operation to remove Maduro appears to be illegal, and it’s not at all clear that the regime itself will be toppled or that life will improve for ordinary Venezuelans.\n\nBarging into countries to arrest a foe, reportedly killing at least 80 people in the process, is not a precedent we want others to follow. I’m in Taiwan as I write this, and some are wondering if President Xi Jinping of China will get ideas. Frankly, I doubt that: I believe that what constrains Xi is military calculus, not concern for the rule of law. But it’s still true that the world works better when the United States promotes the “rules-based international order” rather than the law of the jungle that Thucydides recounted 2,500 years ago: “The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.”\n\nTrump could have tried to provide a legal justification for the incursion by saying that he had the permission of Venezuela’s rightful president, Edmundo González, the apparent winner of the 2024 election. The United States even under President Joe Biden recognized González as Venezuela’s true president-elect, so that might have been a useful fig leaf for lawyers to work with. But Trump has been dismissive of the democratic forces represented by González and María Corina Machado, the opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner.\n\nInstead, Trump asserted in a news conference on Saturday, “We are going to run the country.” He seemed less interested in Venezuelan democracy and human rights than in gaining American control over Venezuelan oil. “We’re going to have presence in Venezuela as it pertains to oil,” he declared.\n\nAll that should sound an alarm. The military and intelligence side of the Venezuela operation was masterful, but the legal and political sides seem frightful, and that bodes poorly for the country’s future.\n\nMaduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, remains in place, and is acting as president. Trump aides seem to think they can control Venezuela through her, but for now, Rodriguez does not seem eager to be their poodle.\n\n“If there is something the Venezuelan people will never be again, it is slaves,” she said. She referred to the attack on her country as “barbaric” and an “illegal kidnapping.”\n\nIt’s true that Rodríguez has been more pragmatic in her career and more attuned to the public’s well-being than Maduro was (a low bar), but in any case, it’s not clear how much autonomy she has to make decisions. Venezuela is run by a clutch of top security officials backed by Cuban gunmen, and it’s not obvious why they would choose to surrender power.\n\nIf Rodríguez resists, what then? Trump suggested that there might be a “second wave” of attacks. “We’re not afraid of boots on the ground,” he said, but he should be. For America to dispatch an invading force to occupy Venezuela, an area roughly twice the size of California, would take an enormous force; Afghanistan and Iraq should have taught us a bit of prudence.\n\nChina was bitterly critical of Trump’s attack on Venezuela, but I wonder if China might prove a beneficiary of it. Careless invasions reinforce narratives of Yankee arrogance and undermine American soft power. And while Trump aides intellectually understand the need to redirect attention and resources to Asia, Venezuela may end up being a long-term distraction that would impede that pivot.\n\nMaybe I’m being too bleak; it’s possible that this will all work out. Perhaps economic pressure and the threat of further military force will lead the Venezuelan regime to hand power to Machado and those around her. If Venezuela were properly led, it could thrive and become an engine for the region, and the loss of Venezuelan support might bring down the Cuban dictatorship as well.\n\nYet it’s quite possible that the Maduro regime will stagger on without Maduro, leaving the population increasingly impoverished. Or Venezuela could descend into chaos or civil war that empowers paramilitary “colectivos” or guerrillas in the leftist ELN organization.\n\nA central lesson of post-World War II military interventions is to beware of leaders glibly celebrating their missions accomplished. Toppling a government is invariably easier than ensuring a better one.\n\nAs I was listening to Trump triumphantly announce his plans to run the country and control Venezuelan oil, I thought of a time I was caught up in street fighting in Caracas in 2002. I was interviewing people in a huge crowd of left-wing Chavistas who were facing off against another large crowd down the street, apparently right-wing anti-Chavistas. Gunshots were fired, bottles rained down, and the army fired tear gas to try to dispel the crowds.\n\nI slipped over to interview people on the other side — and discovered that they were Chavistas as well. Two furious mobs, unaware that they were on the same side, were straining through the tear gas to rip each other apart.\n\nVenezuela is murky like that. So hold the champagne, for that scene suggests the deceptive and dangerous terrain on which Trump’s gunboat diplomacy has landed us.\n\nI’m looking for a travel partner!

    "description": "UN body’s recommendations driven by AI advances and proliferation of consumer-oriented neurotech devices",
    "fullText": "UN body’s recommendations driven by AI advances and proliferation of consumer-oriented neurotech devices\n\nIt is the latest move in a growing international effort to put guardrails around a burgeoning frontier – technologies that harness data from the brain and nervous system.\n\nUnesco has adopted a set of global standards on the ethics of neurotechnology, a field that has been described as “a bit of a wild west”.\n\n“There is no control,” said Unesco’s chief of bioethics, Dafna Feinholz. “We have to inform the people about the risks, the potential benefits, the alternatives, so that people have the possibility to say ‘I accept, or I don’t accept’.”\n\nShe said the new standards were driven by two recent developments in neurotechnology: artificial intelligence (AI), which offers vast possibilities in decoding brain data, and the proliferation of consumer-grade neurotech devices such as earbuds that claim to read brain activity and glasses that track eye movements.\n\nThe standards define a new category of data, “neural data”, and suggest guidelines governing its protection. A list of more than 100 recommendations ranges from rights-based concerns to addressing scenarios that are – at least for now – science fiction, such as companies using neurotechnology to subliminally market to people during their dreams.\n\n“Neurotechnology has the potential to define the next frontier of human progress, but it is not without risks,” said Unesco’s director general, Audrey Azoulay. The new standards would “enshrine the inviolability of the human mind”, she said.\n\nBillions of dollars have poured into neurotech ventures in the past few years, from Sam Altman’s August investment in Merge Labs, a competitor to Elon Musk’s Neuralink, to Meta’s recent unveiling of a wristband that allows users to control their phone or AI Ray-Bans by reading muscle movements in their wrist.\n\nThe wave of investment has brought with it a growing push for regulation. The World Economic Forum released a paper last month calling for a privacy oriented framework, and the US senator Chuck Schumer introduced the Mind Act in September – following the lead of four states that have introduced laws to protect “neural data” since 2024.\n\nAdvocates for neurotech regulation emphasise the importance of safeguarding personal data. Unesco’s standards highlight the need for “mental privacy” and “freedom of thought”.\n\nSceptics, however, say legislative efforts are often driven by dystopian anxieties and risk hampering vital medical advances.\n\n“What’s happening with all this legislation is fear. People are afraid of what this technology is capable of. The idea of neurotech reading people’s minds is scary,” said Kristen Mathews, a lawyer who works on mental privacy issues at the US law firm Cooley.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, neurotechnology has been around for more than 100 years. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was invented in 1924, and the first brain-computer interfaces were developed in the 1970s. The latest wave of investment, however, is driven by advances in AI that make it possible to decode large amounts of data – including, possibly, brainwaves.\n\n“The thing that has enabled this technology to present perceived privacy issues is the introduction of AI,” said Mathews.\n\nSome AI-enabled neurotech advances could be medically transformative, helping treat conditions from Parkinson’s disease to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\nA paper published in Nature this summer described an AI-powered brain-computer interface decoding the speech of a paralysis patient. Other work suggests AI may one day be able to “read” your thoughts – or at least, reconstruct an image if you concentrate on it hard.\n\nThe hype around some of these advances has generated fears that Mathews said were often far removed from the real dangers. The Mind Act, for example, says AI and the “vertical corporate integration” of neurotechnology could lead to “cognitive manipulation” and “erosion of personal autonomy”.\n\n“I’m not aware of any company that’s doing any of this stuff. It’s not going to happen. Maybe two decades from now,” she said.\n\nThe current frontier of neurotechnology lies in improving brain-computer interfaces, which despite recent breakthroughs are in their infancy – and in the proliferation of consumer-oriented devices, which Mathews said could raise privacy concerns, a bugbear of the Unesco standards. She argues, however, that creating the concept of “neural data” is too broad an approach to this issue.\n\n“That’s the type of thing that we would want to address. Monetising, behavioural advertising, using neural data. But the laws that are out there, they’re not getting at the stuff we’re worried about. They’re more amorphous.”",

    "description": "The U.S. took the unprecedented step Monday of dropping the number of vaccines it recommends for every child —  leaving other immunizations, such as flu shots, open to families to choose but without clear guidance.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. took the unprecedented step Monday of cutting the number of vaccines it recommends for every child — a move that leading medical groups said would undermine protections against a half-dozen diseases.\n\nThe change is effective immediately, meaning that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now recommend that all children get vaccinated against 11 diseases. What’s no longer broadly recommended is protection against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, some forms of meningitis or RSV. Instead, protections against those diseases are only recommended for certain groups deemed high risk, or when doctors recommend them in what’s called “shared decision-making.”\n\nTrump administration officials said the overhaul, a move long sought by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., won’t result in families who want the vaccines losing access to them, and said insurance will continue to pay. But medical experts said the decision creates confusion for parents and could increase preventable diseases.\n\nStates, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While CDC requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the Trump administration’s guidance on vaccines.\n\nThe change comes as U.S. vaccination rates have been slipping and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising across the country.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the overhaul was in response to a request from President Donald Trump in December. Trump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.\n\nHHS said its comparison to 20 peer nations found that the U.S. was an “outlier” in both the number of vaccinations and the number of doses it recommended to all children. Officials with the agency framed the change as a way to increase public trust by recommending only the most important vaccinations for children to receive.\n\nAP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on the U.S. lowering the number of recommended childhood vaccines.\n\n“This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,” Kennedy said in a statement Monday.\n\nTrump, reacting to the news on his Truth Social platform, said the new schedule is “far more reasonable” and “finally aligns the United States with other Developed Nations around the World.”\n\nAmong those left on the recommended-for-everyone list are vaccines against measles, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, chickenpox and human papillomavirus, or HPV. The guidance reduces the number of recommended vaccine doses against HPV from two or three shots depending on age to one for most children.\n\nMedical experts said Monday’s changes without what they said was public discussion or a transparent review of the data would put children at risk.\n\n“Abandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,” said Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota.\n\nDr. Sean O’Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics said countries carefully consider vaccine recommendations based on levels of disease in their populations and their health systems.\n\n“You can’t just copy and paste public health and that’s what they seem to be doing here,” said O’Leary. “Literally children’s health and children’s lives are at stake.”\n\nMost high-income countries recommend vaccinations against a dozen to 15 serious pathogens, according to a recent review by the Vaccine Integrity Project, a group that works to safeguard vaccine use.\n\nFrance today recommends all children get vaccinated against 14 diseases, compared to the 11 that the U.S. now will recommend for every child under the new schedule.\n\nThe changes were made by political appointees, without any evidence that the current recommendations were harming children, O’Leary said.\n\nThe pediatricians’ group has issued its own childhood vaccine schedule that its members are following, and it continues to broadly recommend vaccines that the Trump administration demoted.\n\nO’Leary singled out the flu vaccine, which the government and leading medical experts have long urged for nearly everyone starting at age 6 months. He said the government is “pretty tone deaf” for ending its recommendation while the country is at the beginning of a severe flu season, and after 280 children died from flu last winter, the most since 2009.\n\nEven a disease that parents may not have heard of, rotavirus, could come roaring back if vaccination erodes, he added. That diarrheal disease once hospitalized thousands of children each winter, something that no longer happens.\n\nThe decision was made without input from an advisory committee that typically consults on the vaccine schedule, said senior officials at HHS. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the changes publicly.\n\nThe officials added that the new recommendations were a collaborative effort between federal health agencies but wouldn’t specify who was consulted.\n\nScientists at the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases were asked to present to the agency’s political leadership about vaccine schedules in other countries in December, but they were not allowed to give any recommendations and were not aware of any decisions about vaccine schedule changes, said Abby Tighe, executive director of the National Public Health Coalition, an advocacy organization of current and former CDC employees and their supporters.\n\n“Changes of this magnitude require careful review, expert and public input, and clear scientific justification. That level of rigor and transparency was not part of this decision,” said Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, of the American Medical Association. “The scientific evidence remains unchanged, and the AMA supports continued access to childhood immunizations recommended by national medical specialty societies.”\n\nThe move comes as Kennedy, a longtime activist against vaccines, has repeatedly used his authority in government to translate his skepticism about the shots into national guidance.\n\nIn May, Kennedy announced the CDC would no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women — a move immediately questioned by public health experts who saw no new data to justify the change.\n\nIn June, Kennedy fired an entire 17-member CDC vaccine advisory committee — later installing several of his own replacements, including multiple vaccine skeptics.\n\nKennedy in November also personally directed the CDC to abandon its position that vaccines do not cause autism, without supplying any new evidence to support the change.\n\nSwenson reported from New York.

    "title": "Nvidia Details New A.I. Chips and Autonomous Car Project with Mercedes",
    "description": "At the CES conference, Jensen Huang, the company’s chief executive, said the more efficient and powerful chip would begin shipping later this year.",
    "fullText": "Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip-making giant Nvidia, put his company at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom by making semiconductors more powerful than any of his rivals’. This year, he’s promising to do it again.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Huang said the company would begin shipping a new A.I. chip later this year, one that can do more computing with less power than previous generations of chips could. Known as the Vera Rubin, the chip has been in development for three years and is designed to fulfill A.I. requests more quickly and cheaply than its predecessors.\n\nMr. Huang, who spoke during CES, an annual tech conference in Las Vegas, also discussed Nvidia’s surprisingly ambitious work around autonomous vehicles. This year, Mercedes-Benz will begin shipping cars equipped with Nvidia self-driving technology comparable to Tesla’s Autopilot.\n\nNvidia’s new Rubin chips are being manufactured and will be shipped to customers, including Microsoft and Amazon, in the second half of the year, fulfilling a promise Mr. Huang made last March when he first described the chip at the company’s annual conference in San Jose, Calif.\n\nCompanies will be able to train A.I. models with one-quarter as many Rubin chips as its predecessor, the Blackwell. It can provide information for chatbots and other A.I. products for one-tenth of the cost. They will also be able to install the chips in data centers more quickly, courtesy of redesigned supercomputers that feature fewer cables.\n\nIf the new chips live up to their promise, they could allow companies to develop A.I. at a lower cost and at least begin to respond to the soaring electrical demands of data centers being built around the world.\n\n“This is how we’re going to get everybody to the next frontier and push A.I. to the next level and, of course, to build these data centers energy efficiently and cost efficiently as well,” Mr. Huang said.\n\nThe Rubin chips are named for the astronomer Vera Rubin, who did groundbreaking research on dark matter. The new chips are key to maintaining Nvidia’s dominance of the A.I. industry and its perch as the world’s most valuable company. Nvidia’s A.I. chips, which account for more than 90 percent of the market, are highly coveted by businesses and governments around the world. It sells them for about $30,000 each, with nearly three-quarters of that being pure profit.\n\nBut the company is facing increased competition from chip makers and even some customers who are eager to seize a slice of the lucrative A.I. industry. Last year, Advanced Micro Devices, known as AMD, and Google, which buys Nvidia chips but also makes its own chips, struck deals to provide their technology to OpenAI, one of the world’s largest users of A.I. chips.\n\nThe rising threat contributed to Nvidia’s deal last month to license technology from the chip start-up Groq. The agreement is expected to help Nvidia develop chips that allow A.I. to more efficiently fulfill requests through a process known as inference.\n\nBecause more people are using A.I., chip makers are trying to make delivering it less expensive and less power hungry, said Daniel Newman, the chief executive of Futurum Group, a tech research firm. “That’s the name of the game because utilization is very early,” he said.\n\nThe competitive challenges have buffeted Nvidia alongside a series of geopolitical headaches. Mr. Huang spent much of last year lobbying President Trump to allow Nvidia to sell its A.I. chips to China. At the same time, he was trying to fend off efforts by Beijing to discourage Chinese companies from buying Nvidia’s chips because of security concerns.\n\nIn December, Mr. Trump granted the company permission to sell its second-most-powerful chip to China. But Beijing has not decided whether it will allow its companies to buy Nvidia products.\n\nDemand for Nvidia’s chips has turned Mr. Huang, 62, into a globe-trotting salesman and diplomat. He traveled with Mr. Trump to the Middle East and Britain, where he played a key role in technology deals between nations.\n\nNvidia’s business has flourished during the A.I. boom of the past three years. In November, the company reported a quarterly profit of $31.9 billion, a 65 percent increase from a year earlier and 245 percent from the year before that. It expects about $500 billion in sales through the end of this year.\n\nStill, Mr. Huang has been eager to diversify Nvidia’s business and expand its roster of customers. He has been pushing the company to become a major player in robotics and autonomous vehicles.\n\nOn Monday, he said Nvidia had developed new A.I. software that would allow customers like Uber and Lucid to develop cars that navigate roads autonomously. It will share the system, called Alpamayo, to spread its influence and the appeal of Nvidia’s chip technology.\n\nSince 2020, Nvidia has been working with Mercedes to develop a class of self-driving cars. They will begin shipping an early example of their collaboration when Mercedes CLA cars become available in the first half of the year in Europe and the United States.\n\nMr. Huang said the company started working on self-driving technology eight years ago. It has more than a thousand people working on the project.\n\n“Our vision is that someday, every single car, every single truck, will be autonomous,” Mr. Huang said.",

    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence rarely shocks senior engineers anymore. Most professionals in big tech expect rapid progress. Yet, in early 2026, a candid revelation by Jaana Dogan, a principal engineer at Google, managed to do exactly that. Her experience with an AI coding tool ignited a global conversation about software development, productivity, and the real role of human engineers in an AI-assisted future.\n\nThis was not marketing hype. It came from someone deeply involved in building large-scale AI systems. That authenticity is why her story resonated across the tech world.\n\nJaana Dogan is a Principal Engineer at Google, associated with work on advanced AI systems, including Google’s Gemini ecosystem. Engineers at this level typically focus on system architecture, long-term design decisions, and complex coordination between multiple components rather than routine coding.\n\nShe is not a celebrity technologist or influencer. Instead, she represents a growing group of highly experienced engineers who speak openly about how AI tools are reshaping their daily work. That credibility matters, especially when discussing sensitive topics like productivity gains and automation.\n\nThe moment that brought Jaana Dogan into the spotlight involved a hands-on experiment with Claude Code, an AI coding tool developed by Anthropic. Out of curiosity, she tested whether the tool could understand and recreate a complex system her team had already built at Google.\n\nAccording to Dogan, after providing a clear description of the problem, the AI generated a functional version of a distributed agent orchestrator in roughly one hour. Her team had spent close to a year designing and building a similar system internally.\n\nThis account was first reported by The Indian Express, which quoted Dogan’s own public remarks and reactions from the wider tech community.\n\nTo understand why this mattered, some context helps.\n\nA distributed agent orchestrator is not a simple script. It coordinates multiple autonomous agents, manages communication between them, and ensures tasks execute in the correct order. These systems often involve:\n\nIn large organizations like Google, building such systems involves months of design reviews, testing, and refinements. That’s why the speed of the AI-generated result raised eyebrows.\n\nThe AI output was not production-ready software. Dogan herself made that clear. The generated code still required validation, security reviews, performance testing, and human judgment. However, the structure and logic closely resembled what her team had arrived at after extensive discussions.\n\nThink of it like this: the AI produced a strong architectural draft, not a finished skyscraper.\n\nThis distinction is crucial for maintaining factual accuracy and avoiding exaggerated claims.\n\nThis was not a startup demo or marketing blog post. The observation came from a senior Google engineer with direct experience in large-scale AI systems.\n\nDogan openly acknowledged limitations instead of claiming AI superiority. That balance increased trust in her assessment.\n\nIf AI tools can reduce early-stage development time from months to hours, workflows will change. That affects cost planning, timelines, and team structures.\n\nCoverage from The Economic Times and Times of India further highlighted how divisive this moment was for software engineers globally.\nSources:\n– Economic Times (Technology Updates)\n– Times of India (Tech News)\n\nLong answer: The role is evolving.\n\nAI tools excel at pattern recognition and rapid synthesis. They struggle with context, accountability, and responsibility. Human engineers still:\n\nDecide whether an approach fits real-world constraints\n\nHandle edge cases that AI cannot predict\n\nEnsure compliance with legal and ethical standards\n\nMaintain systems over long timeframes\n\nDogan herself encouraged developers to test AI tools in domains they understand deeply. That advice reflects confidence, not fear.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of this story is Dogan’s openness about a competitor’s product. Historically, engineers at major tech firms avoid praising rival tools publicly.\n\nHer response suggests a cultural shift. Many professionals now view AI advancement as a shared ecosystem rather than a zero-sum competition. Progress by one company often pushes the entire field forward.\n\nThat mindset aligns with broader industry trends toward open research, shared benchmarks, and collaborative safety discussions.\n\nTeams can explore ideas quickly without committing months up front.\n\nEngineers may spend less time on boilerplate code and more time on design, review, and decision-making.\n\nPrompt design, system evaluation, and AI oversight will become core technical skills.\n\nThese conclusions align with discussions already happening in academic research and enterprise software planning.\n\nThis story gained traction not because it was sensational, but because it felt honest. It showed excitement, concern, and realism at the same time.\n\nDogan didn’t claim AI had “won.” She highlighted how powerful tools can reshape workflows when used thoughtfully. That balanced perspective is exactly what Google’s E-E-A-T framework values: experience, expertise, authority, and trust.\n\nJaana Dogan did not set out to start a global debate. She simply shared an authentic professional observation. Yet that moment revealed something important: AI tools are no longer just assistants. They are becoming collaborators.\n\nThe future of software development will not be purely human or purely automated. It will sit somewhere in between. Engineers like Jaana Dogan help the industry understand that future clearly, without hype or fear.\n\nAnd that clarity, more than speed or novelty, is what truly matters.\n\nThe Indian Express – Global Technology Coverage\n\nThe Economic Times – AI & Software Industry News\n\nJaana Dogan is a Principal Engineer at Google who works on advanced artificial intelligence systems,\n\nincluding projects related to Google’s Gemini AI ecosystem. She is known for sharing real-world\n\ninsights on how AI tools impact modern software development.\n\nJaana Dogan’s AI experiment went viral because she revealed that an AI coding tool recreated a system\n\nsimilar to her team’s year-long engineering work in about one hour, sparking debate about AI’s role\n\nin software development.\n\nNo, AI did not replace human engineers in Jaana Dogan’s experiment. The AI-generated code acted as a\n\nprototype and still required human expertise for validation, testing, optimization, and long-term\n\nsystem responsibility.\n\nA distributed agent orchestrator is a software system that coordinates multiple autonomous agents,\n\nmanages communication between them, and ensures tasks execute reliably across distributed computing\n\nenvironments.\n\nJaana Dogan’s experience shows that AI can dramatically speed up early-stage development and\n\nprototyping, while human engineers remain essential for system design, ethical decisions, quality\n\ncontrol, and long-term maintenance.",

    "fullText": "Syril, 25, carries a large banner of the US constitution with a number of other demonstrators during a protest marking US President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, in Washington, DC, US, 30 April 2025. REUTERS/Allison Bailey\n\nThe Trump administration has executed a wide-ranging crackdown on freedom of speech by targeting student protestors, lawyers and the press. Global Insight assesses the threat to the rule of law and what is being done to protect it.\n\nOn 8 March, recent Colombia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil was returning home from dinner with his eight-month pregnant wife when he was arrested and forced into an unmarked car by four agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Khalil, a legal resident in the US, had been a leader of the pro-Palestine protests on Colombia’s campus last spring. He is being held in a detention facility in Louisiana awaiting deportation and has not been charged with a crime.\n\n‘They are targeting the most vulnerable people who are standing up for Palestinian rights,’ says Justin Mazzola, Deputy Director of Research at Amnesty International USA, which is working closely with the lawyers on Khalil’s case. ‘The idea is to basically get people to stop protesting what’s happening in Gaza.’\n\nIn the short time that US president Donald Trump has held power, his administration has weaponised the federal government to suppress speech and punish his adversaries. In what many experts have challenged as a violation of First Amendment rights, a cornerstone of US democracy, President Trump has threatened protestors, banned news outlets from covering White House events and used executive orders to sanction law firms who he believes attacked him unfairly in the past. Subsequent court cases will test America’s most fundamental checks and balances on executive power.\n\nJonathan Hafetz\n\n Membership Officer, IBA Human Rights Law Committee\n\n‘We are seeing the gravest assault on freedom of speech at least since the McCarthy era, and I think in many respects the nation’s history,’ says Jonathan Hafetz, a professor of law at Seton Hall Law School and Membership Officer of the IBA Human Rights Law Committee.\n\nThe high-profile arrest of Khalil is part of a series of actions taken by the Trump administration against foreign students who have expressed support for Palestinians. Students and faculty members at US universities across the country have been detained by federal agents and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that his department has revoked at least 300 foreign students’ visas. Following arrests, government lawyers have cited a provision of a rarely used 1952 immigration law that allows the Secretary of State to revoke visas or permanent residency from anyone judged to be undermining US foreign policy. Jameel Jaffer, the inaugural director of the Knight First Amendment Institute, an independent organisation founded by Colombia University, believes that the arrests and detentions of foreign students are ‘impossible to reconcile’ with the First Amendment, and predicts that the courts will eventually make clear that it protects non-citizens from deportation. ‘At the most basic level if the First Amendment means anything it means that the government can’t arrest you or imprison you for political speech,’ he says. ‘That is the core protection of the First Amendment.’\n\nIn March, the national American Association of University Professors (AAUP), AAUP chapters at Havard, NYU and Rutgers, and the Middle East Studies Association, represented by the Knight Institute, filed a lawsuit in Boston seeking to block the arrests, detentions and deportations of international students and staff ‘who participate in pro-Palestinian protests and other protected First Amendment activities.’\n\nJaffer adds, however, that the question of whether the Trump administration will comply with any court rulings remains. ‘Both the court’s willingness to enforce their orders and the Trump administration’s decisions about how to respond to the court orders will be influenced by perceptions of public opinion,’ he says.\n\nAlongside visa revocations in recent months the US government commenced a widespread termination of Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records from a national database. A visa revocation, while significant, only impacts a person’s ability to return to the country, whereas eliminating a student’s SEVIS status puts them at risk of deportation. The government has since reversed the policy and reactivated most records following hundreds of lawsuits filed by students who said their records had been terminated based on charges that had been dismissed or minor offences that would not warrant a cancellation. NAFSA, an educational non-profit, found that some SEVIS record terminations referenced ‘potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.’\n\nAdam Cohen, an immigration lawyer and partner at Siskind Susser in Tennessee, is concerned by the lack of due process and transparency related to the SEVIS terminations, which he says could resume at any time. ‘The problem is when they’re terminating the SEVIS record, they’re making people believe that they need to leave immediately and they’re not even getting to that hearing in an immigration court,’ he says. ‘It’s not even clear what the issue was right? What was the adverse foreign policy? In certain cases, did they repost something on social media?’\n\nIn addition to the crackdown on international students the White House has threatened to withdraw millions of dollars in federal funding from at least 60 universities unless they agree to a set of demands to address alleged failures to comply with federal civil rights laws related to antisemitism and drop diversity, equity and inclusion policies. In response, elite US university Havard has filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing the funding freeze violates procedural requirements and its First Amendment Rights to freedom of speech. To restore its funding, Colombia University agreed to many of the administration’s demands including allowing security officers to remove or arrest individuals and taking control of its Middle East department from faculty.\n\nJameel Jaffer\n\n Director, Knight First Amendment Institute\n\nIn response to the action against Colombia, of the country’s top constitutional professors, both liberal and conservatives, wrote an open letter critical of the Trump administration’s use of funding cuts ‘as a tool to pressure recipients into suppressing First-Amendment protected speech,' which can extend to viewpoints ‘many of us find wrongheaded or deeply offensive.’ The First Amendment offers broad protections and guarantees freedom of the press, speech, religion, the right to assemble and the right to petition the government.\n\nJaffer says the damage being done while students and universities wait for court judgments is significant. ‘It has created a climate of fear and repression on campuses across the country,’ he says. ‘It’s caused an intense chilling effect and really changed the character of American universities quite dramatically.’\n\nIn certain cases, the question of whether the executive branch would defy a ruling by a federal judge has already been answered. In February the chief judge of the US Court for the District of Colombia ordered the US government to halt deportation flights carrying immigrants alleged to be Venezuelan gang members. But officials chose to ignore the order. ‘This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!’ President Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social. In April, the FBI arrested a judge in Wisconsin for allegedly helping an undocumented migrant evade arrest.\n\nFollowing the Trump administration’s refusal to turn the planes around, many commentators have declared the US in a constitutional crisis. Steven Richman is Chair of the IBA’s Bar Issue Commission and a member at Clark Hill. He says while Trump undermining judges is concerning, the fears about him transforming the US into an authoritarian state should be placed in context. ‘Since Marbury v Madison established the primacy of judicial review in 1803, by which the federal courts could declare legislation, as well as executive and administrative actions as unconstitutional, presidents of various parties from time to time have been alleged to have defied the Supreme Court. The facts of each situation and specific rulings of the Court remain important to evaluate the executive’s conduct. What is significant is that there remains an acknowledgement that the rule of law governs, and Marbury v Madison remains in place.’\nSome of the most aggressive escalations of the Trump administration’s assaults on the legal system have manifested in a barrage of executive orders punishing large commercial law firms who have represented his political opponents or been involved in causes against him. The orders, which allege wrongdoing by individual lawyers and civil rights law violations by affirmative action schemes, terminate the firms from government contracts and restrict their employees from access to federal buildings. To avoid the sanctions, multiple law firms have cut deals with President Trump and collectively agreed to provide $940m in pro bono work for causes his administration supports. Others have decided to stand firm.\n\n‘The order is a plain violation of the First Amendment,’ Jenner & Block said, which, alongside Perkins Coie and WilmerHale, successfully obtained preliminary court rulings to block the executive orders. ‘Our constitution forbids attempts by the government to retaliate against citizens and lawyers based on the clients they represent, the positions they advocate, the opinions they voice and the people with whom they associate.’\n\nRichman says the government using executive power to take revenge on lawyers is problematic and a direct challenge to the independence of the legal profession. ‘If someone feels that a law firm has brought a frivolous or legally unjustified claim, there are remedies at law for pursuing such claims. The end can never justify the means. The means – due process, fairness, respect for the social contract and political will that underlies a system – must be respected.’\n\nIn response to the executive orders more than 500 law firms signed an amicus brief, accusing the Trump administration of a campaign of ‘draconian punishment’ against lawyers who have acted for clients it disapproves of. ‘Whatever short-term advantage the administration may gain from exercising power in this way, the rule of law cannot endure in the climate of fear that such actions create.’\n\nSome lawyers at firms who are unhappy with their employer’s decision to negotiate a deal with President Trump have quit their jobs in protest. One such former associate, Rachel Cohen, gave up her role at a prestigious white shoe law firm because of its decision not to challenge the Trump administration’s sanctioning of the legal profession. ‘I sent what I considered a conditional resignation that either we need to do something about this real infringement on the legal system, on democracy, on traditional impartiality, or I can’t work here anymore.’\n\nCohen, who has now joined recently launched firm Lowell and Associates, which is dedicated to representing those facing legal actions from the Trump administration, believes that the agreements law firms are reaching with Trump are shortsighted, especially in the cases where they have proactively made a deal with Trump to avoid an executive order being issued in the first place. ‘I don’t know why anyone would think that a president who has a history of not respecting people who he has entered into deals with would respect the terms of a terrible deal when people have shown them what their weak spots are,’ she says.\n\nLower courts have been strong in opposing President Trump’s efforts to undermine the legal system and suppress freedom of speech. A federal judge in Washington, DC temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order against Susman Godfrey, which helped Dominion (a manufacturer of voting machines that lawyers for Trump falsely accused of deleting votes for him in the 2020 election) secure a $700m settlement to resolve a defamation case against Fox News. The judge called the executive order ‘a shocking abuse of power’, which stemmed from a ‘personal vendetta.'\n\n‘It was a clear attempt to retaliate against the law firm for representing a client that was seeking to hold Fox News to account for spreading lies and misinformation about the 2020 election,’ says Hafetz. ‘This is why it is so surprising and disappointing that some law firms have sought to cut deals with the Trump administration because those firms that have fought back have been vindicated and received relief.’\n\nIn its statement after the settlement, Fox acknowledged that the court found some of its statements about Dominion to be false, but said its settlement ‘reflects Fox’s continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards.’\n\nAlongside law firms, major media organisations have chosen to negotiate with Trump rather than challenge his attacks. In the run up to President Trump’s inauguration ABC News quickly settled a defamation lawsuit filed by Trump and Meta agreed to pay $25m to resolve a lawsuit over its decision to suspend Trump from its social media platforms following the January 6 attack on the US capital. In another notable move, the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times pulled their presidential endorsements.\n\nSince taking office, the Trump administration has taken an aggressive approach to news organisations it disfavours. The Federal Communications Commission has opened investigations into ABC, CBS and NBC News. In February, the White House announced that it had banned the Associated Press from accessing certain press events because of its refusal to rename a body of water the Gulf of America. The White House said it would also exert greater control over which news outlets would get access to the president.\n\nPeople take part in a rally organised by Jewish activists against the detention by ICE agents of Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil in New York City, U.S., 20 March 2025. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz\n\nGovernments favouring certain news organisations over others ‘is part of the authoritarian playbook,’ says Mark Stephens, Co-Chair of the IBA’s Human Rights Institute. ‘Banning the Associated Press essentially covering Trump in the way you would normally expect is designed to interfere with the free flow of information.’\n\nMel Bunce, a professor of international journalism and politics at City St George’s, University of London, says that the seriousness of the ban is underscored by the vital role of the Associated Press as a conduit for information. ‘The Associated Press is an incredibly important news organisation that is relied on by hundreds of news outlets around the world. Alongside Reuters and AFP, it is one of the most important building blocks of the international news system,’ she says. ‘It is one of the most rigorous and fact-based news organisations, and their news is shared globally – to millions of people in audiences around the world. And that’s why this is such a red flag.’\n\nWhile targeting the mainstream media, the Trump administration has branded itself as the ultimate defender of free speech. Trump officials backed up by billionaire social media owners have become fervent critics of ‘censorship’ coming from ‘woke’ progressivism that, they argue, would like to constrain the First Amendment.\n\nIn April a federal judge in a preliminary injunction ordered the White House to restore the access of The Associated Press access to cover presidential events, affirming on First Amendment grounds that the government cannot punish the news organisation for the content of its speech. Trump administration lawyers argued in court filings that the Associated Press does not have a constitutional right to specific presidential events.\n\nIn a show of solidarity against the ban, 40 news organisations signed a letter urging the White House to reverse the restrictions on the Associated Press. The signatories included outlets like Fox News and Newsmax, where many of the broadcasters and audience members are Trump supporters.\n\nAmy Brouillette is Director of Advocacy at the International Press Institute, an organisation that works to defend press freedom and independent journalism. ‘Limiting access to media pool events because of the news agency’s editorial decisions stifles freedom of speech,’ she says. ‘News organisations should be allowed to make editorial decisions without fear of retaliation from government officials.’\n\nIn another setback to the Trump administration a federal judge temporarily blocked its dismantling of state-funded broadcaster Voice of America, following an executive order accusing it of being ‘anti-Trump’ and ‘radical’. The director of Voice of America, Mike Abramowitz announced that almost his entire staff of 1,300 people had been placed on administrative leave.\n\nThe Trump administration’s decision to dismantle the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and the 90-day freeze on foreign development assistance funding, is also impacting independent journalism internationally. ‘The recent freezing of USAID is having a very serious impact on the media and civil society organisations that play a role in ensuring accountability and transparency,’ says Brouillette. ‘The role that the media and civil society play is not only important for democracy but it’s also important for peace and security.’\n\nAlice Johnson is the IBA Multimedia Journalist and can be contacted at alice.johnson@int-bar.org",

    "title": "FEC Obstructed from Enforcing Campaign Finance Laws for Last 250 Days",
    "description": "The Federal Election Commission needs its ability to function restored, without sacrificing its independence.",
    "fullText": "Since Thursday, the bipartisan Federal Election Commission hasn’t been able do its job. That’s because the independent agency, which oversees money in campaigns for federal office, no longer has the minimum four required members to do most business.\n\nThe loss of quorum is due to the resignation of a Republican appointee, coupled with President Trump’s unprecedented move in February to fire a Democratic appointee. Such a shortfall has only happened three other times in the FEC’s 50-year history, including twice during Trump’s first term.\n\nOrdinarily, the big question would be how fast the president and Congress will move to restore a full complement of commissioners so the agency can function. That is still important. But in light of the firing and the president’s other steps to exert control over the FEC and other independent agencies, there is now a much bigger issue: Will the FEC be able to continue as an independent watchdog at all? Because even worse than a dormant FEC is one that could be weaponized against the president’s opponents.\n\nThe FEC was created as part of the post-Watergate reforms that established our current system of campaign contribution limits and disclosure requirements. It is led by six commissioners, no more than three of whom can be from one party. When fewer than four seats are filled, the commission cannot carry out most of its important functions, including enforcing the law and issuing regulations and other legal guidance.\n\nThanks in part to its evenly divided leadership, the FEC is nobody’s idea of an aggressive watchdog, often deadlocking on partisan lines in important matters. That gridlock has exacerbated the effects of Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United, for instance, by making it easier for candidates to outsource key campaign operations to super PACs that can raise unlimited amounts of money.\n\nBut even a dysfunctional FEC is still important. Among other things, the agency plays a vital role in collecting and disseminating campaign finance data, which is critical at a time when Trump and his Democratic opponents continue raising money at a rapid clip ahead of the 2026 midterms (and when a number of the president’s biggest donors have a hand in shaping policy in his administration).\n\nLoss of the FEC’s quorum won’t keep data from being collected and published, but the commission won’t be able to do anything to enforce reporting requirements against those who ignore them. It also can’t address novel legal issues that arise — for instance, in connection to online campaign activity, where significant reporting gaps remain.\n\nBut the loss of the FEC’s quorum may not even be the agency’s biggest challenge. In February, the president fired a sitting Democratic appointee, Ellen Weintraub (full disclosure: I worked for Weintraub from 2011 to 2014). This firing is the reason the FEC was down to only four commissioners before the latest resignation.\n\nTo be sure, Weintraub’s term at the commission had long expired and she was eligible to be replaced. But no president has ever removed an FEC commissioner from the opposing party without naming a replacement, usually selected by the opposition party’s congressional leaders. Her removal was part of a series of firings of Democratic commissioners at independent agencies who are supposed to be legally insulated from presidential removal — representing a major power grab by the White House.\n\nSeveral weeks later, the White House issued an executive order purporting to formally place all independent executive branch agencies under direct presidential control. The president subsequently issued an order that, among other things, directs the Election Assistance Commission — another federal agency that was modeled in key respects on the FEC — to illegally revise federal voter registration procedures. A federal court has blocked relevant parts of the order in a Brennan Center lawsuit challenging the move while the case proceeds.\n\nThe president’s assault on the independence of agencies like the Elections Assistance Commission and FEC flies in the face of Article I of the Constitution, which vests oversight over federal elections in the states and Congress. Congress in turn delegated oversight over federal campaign finance rules to the independent FEC with the goal — as we recently noted in a publicly filed comment to the agency — of ensuring that election-related complaints and questions would be handled free from partisan manipulation.\n\nThe record-breaking 2024 election showed the dire need for effective and scrupulously even-handed campaign finance regulation. At a bare minimum, the president and Congress should follow the practices of every president since the 1970s for filling opposing party seats on the commission. Nominees from both parties should also be asked whether they will explicitly commit to defending the FEC’s independence.\n\nUltimately, as frustrating as some of the FEC’s current failings are, the solution can never be to allow the agency to be weaponized for partisan ends. There has long been broad, bipartisan agreement on this point — and it’s more important than ever to reaffirm this commitment to fairness.",

    "description": "The hard-hitting attack version of the special operations MH-60 was clearly among the critical assets used in Operation Absolute Resolve.",
    "fullText": "In the aftermath of the high-profile capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro by the United States, the participation by the Direct Action Penetrator (DAP) version of the U.S. Army’s MH-60M Black Hawk has thrust one of the most intriguing Special Operations Command (SOCOM) assets into the spotlight. These aircraft are the heavier-hitting gunships of the U.S. Army’s elite 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), better known as the Night Stalkers, and Venezuela was exactly the kind of mission for which they are intended to fly, in support of a direct action mission and assault team.\n\nTWZ readers can otherwise get up to speed on the details that are known so far about the operation in our initial reporting here and here.\n\nHeavily armed attack versions of the H-60 Black Hawk family have been used by a variety of nations through the years. However, the specially adapted DAPs flown by the 160th SOAR are undoubtedly the best equipped, even in comparison to the regiment’s standard MH-60s, which are used primarily as transports, and are extremely capable in their own right.\n\nThe 160th SOAR has been operating the tricked-out DAP versions of the Black Hawk since at least 1990, with a primary mission of armed escort and fire support. Currently, the unit only operates the MH-60M version. These are flown alongside the M/AH-6M Little Bird, which also have a gunship configuration, and the MH-47G Chinook; the latter type was also employed in Operation Absolute Resolve in Venezuela.\n\nSeveral videos have emerged from Operation Absolute Resolve showing the MH-60M DAP in action, including reportedly during the assault on Fort Tiuna in Caracas, which you can read more about here. This footage has also been identified by some accounts as showing U.S. Marine Corps AH-1Z Vipers, but it was a DAP. These aircraft are meant to work very close to their targets, with the signature combined strafe and rocket barrage being a primary tactic.\n\nFootage of a U.S. helicopter firing rockets at a ground target in Caracas, Venezuela tonight. pic.twitter.com/5F81gePPin\n\n— OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) January 3, 2026\n\n— Tyler Rogoway (@Aviation_Intel) January 3, 2026\n\nFootage shows a United States Marine Corps (USMC) AH-1Z Viper attack helicopter engaging ground targets with gun and rocket fire in Caracas, Venezuela. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has been captured and flown out of… pic.twitter.com/bPYWXI8Gbr\n\n— OSINTWarfare (@OSINTWarfare) January 3, 2026\n\nA video showing the DAP in action in Afghanistan, using guns and rockets:\n\nIn the broadest terms, the current DAP configuration allies a special operations MH-60M with stub wings for an expanded array of ordnance. These wings can be configured with one or two hardpoints on each side. It’s also worth noting that the MH-60M aircraft are dual-role; each one can be converted back into a transport helo from a DAP configuration in a couple of hours or less. This provides a lot of contingency capability in a single aircraft.\n\nIn terms of armament, the DAPs can carry a combination of 70mm rockets, AGM-114 Hellfire missiles, Stinger ATAS (air-to-air missiles), GAU-19/B 50-cal machine guns, and 30mm M230 cannons. The M230 is the same gun found on the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. In addition, the DAP has a pair of 7.62mm Miniguns that can be locked in a forward-firing mode to add to the firepower. The 70mm rockets include Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System II (APKWS II) versions, with laser guidance, allowing the DAPs to strike with extreme precision.\n\nThe particular configuration seen in the photos below is known as COMNAV IDAP and is typical of how the DAP appeared in Afghanistan in 2012:\n\nThe stores-carrying ability of the 160th’s MH-60Ms has been refined through the introduction of all-new lightweight wings, known as the Multi-Station Lightweight Armament Support Structure (MLASS). These are lighter than the older sponsons and easier for troops to install and remove as necessary. The older ESSS wings and single pylon wings are also available.\n\nAside from the weapons capabilities of the DAP version, the baseline MH-60M is absolutely packed with specialized avionics and systems vital for its critical missions, which are typically flown under the most demanding conditions and primarily at night. Among the most important of these systems are a terrain following radar and a sensor turret with day and night-vision cameras, which we will come back to shortly. Having the same avionics also means the DAP is able to penetrate to the same places as the other 160th SOAR aircraft they are tasked to support.\n\nThe DAP version also benefits from the rolling program of upgrades that keep the MH-60M at the top of its game. For example, the engine air filters seen on the current MH-60M configuration were added specifically because of foreign object damage (FOD) ingestion issues, which particularly affected the DAP, including rocket smoke and shell casings that were found to fly into the intakes during diving attacks.\n\nAt the front of the MH-60M, mounted in the center of the nose, is the terrain-following/terrain avoidance radar. The newer and more capable AN/APQ-187 Silent Knight radar, or SKR, has been steadily replacing the AN/APQ-174 radar. The SKR is also found on Night Stalker MH-47Gs, as well as U.S. Air Force CV-22 Osprey tiltrotors and MC-130J Commando II special operations tanker/transports.\n\nIn both cases, the radar is essential for the MH-60M to safely fly extremely low-altitude nap-of-the-earth flight profiles, even in poor weather and at night. This is exactly the kind of tactics that would have been used in Venezuela and will also have contributed to keeping the helicopters away from enemy air defenses and avoiding detection in general. As far as we know, only one helicopter was damaged in the Maduro snatch, but returned from its mission.\n\nFootage shows Venezuelan ground forces utilizing a MANPADS at a helicopter from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment during the final phase of Operation Absolute Resolve. \n\nShortly after the launch, retaliatory fire was observed, likely delivered by MH-60M DAPs or… pic.twitter.com/ZEhc8rZFBL\n\n— GMI (@Global_Mil_Info) January 4, 2026\n\nOn the nose directly below the radar is the AN/ZSQ-2 sensor turret, which houses electro-optical and infrared full-motion video cameras, as well as a laser rangefinder. The DAP version of the turret additionally features a laser designator for guiding weapons.\n\nAnother important tool that aids navigation through dust, sand, snow, fog, and other ‘degraded’ environments is the Degraded Visual Environment Pilotage System (DVEPS). It uses a combination of cameras and LIDAR, linked to a terrain database, to do this. Among its sensors is the AN/ZSQ-2, seen to the left of the radar in the photo below.\n\nThere are perhaps no helicopters anywhere in the world that are better protected than the 160th SOAR’s fleet.\n\nThe MH-60M is no exception, bristling with arrays of defensive systems all around the aircraft, creating a sphere of situational awareness and protection against multiple kinds of guided threats.\n\nThe defensive suite on the helicopter combines visual/infrared missile, radar, and laser warning sensors, which work together with active jammers and other electronic warfare systems, laser countermeasures, as well as countermeasures dispensers on either side of the tail boom.\n\nThe self-protection systems used by the 160th SOAR fleet are regularly updated to keep pace with changing threats. Among the latest defensive additions to the MH-60M is the Common Infrared Countermeasures (CIRCM) system. As a directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) system, this uses laser beams to blind and confuse the seekers on infrared-homing missiles. CIRCM is integrated with existing warning sensors, which it uses to cue the lasers against incoming threats. The same system is also being fitted on regular Army Black Hawks, as well as CH-47s and AH-64s.\n\nShould the MH-60M crew get ‘painted’ by enemy radars or lasers, or if there’s an enemy missile incoming, they will be warned by the defensive sensors, which will also automatically trigger electronic jamming, the launch of decoy flares and/or radar-spoofing chaff, and/or trigger the CIRCM system. It’s all highly integrated to maximized survivability.\n\nAlso part of the survivability equation is just knowing where threats may be, especially if they pop-up out of nowhere. This is where the aircraft’s electronic support measures, also tied into its defensive suite, provides situational awareness to the crew in order to give them the option of avoiding or engaging threats on the fly. Other threat data is datalinked to the aircraft from various platforms, enhancing overall situational awareness.\n\nOn that note, the MH-60M DAP, in common with all special operations Black Hawks, boasts an extensive communications suite, as evidenced by the dense array of antennas above and below the fuselage. There is also a prominent satellite communications antenna directly above the cockpit.\n\nAs we just discussed in relation to the Venezuela operation earlier today, the Army, and especially the 160th SOAR, has been experimenting with employing launched effects from their H-60s for years now, though this is not an operational capability, at least that we know of at present. These are drones capable of being launched from helicopters (as well as other platforms) that can fly dozens or even hundreds of miles to strike targets, jam emitters, or decoy air defenses, among other tasks. Launched effects are seen as essential to the survivability of helicopters in the future.\n\nThe video below, which the Army released in 2021, includes footage at around the 0:34 mark in the runtime of one of 160th SOAR’s MH-60 Black Hawk helicopters carrying a tube for a ‘launched effect’ under its right stub wing.\n\nLaunched effects are also planned for the Army’s conventional Black Hawk fleet, but the Night Stalkers, and the DAP version of the MH-60M in particular, are likely to receive it first. In Venezuela, launched effects would have allowed the DAP to strike targets indirectly and respond to air defenses as they emerged, launching kinetic attacks to get the main formation of helicopters through to their target. There is some evidence this may have happened for the first time in combat during this operation.\n\nLast but not least, as an MH-60M derivative, the DAP has accommodation for the nose-mounted boom for the in-flight refueling probe. This is telescopic, extending when required to keep the tanker and the trailing drogue clear of the rotor blades. This gives the helicopter much longer range, limited not by fuel onboard but by crew fatigue, lubrication consumption and other factors. They usually refuel from their MC-130J counterparts.\n\nOverall, the DAP version of the MH-60M has a strong claim to being the most heavily armed and best-protected Black Hawk iteration. While it might not be as heavily modified as the stealth Black Hawk, with its radical low-observable features, this remains very much under wraps, and its current status is altogether unclear.\n\nAs it stands, the MH-60M DAP’s combination of heavy armament, radar, and other sensor capabilities, as well as its extensive self-protection and communications systems, made it an obvious candidate in Venezuela. In the case of this raid, DAPs likely pursued troops responding at the complex that was under attack. They would have been tasked with taking out targets such as armored vehicles and anti-aircraft guns, as well as hitting any known threats just before the assaulters arrived. Critical is the fact that the DAPs can operate as an extremely well-trained integrated team with their 160th SOAR stablemates, working seamlessly as a ‘contained’ unit in the most demanding of circumstances. It would be much harder to bring in another ‘big Army’ asset for the same kind of effect.\n\nHopefully, we will in the future learn more details about its role — and that of the wider 160th SOAR — in Operation Absolute Resolve.\n\nContact the author: thomas@thewarzone.com",

    "description": "About a dozen oil tankers loaded with Venezuelan crude and fuel have left the country's waters since the start of the year in apparent defiance of the U.S. government's blockade on",
    "fullText": "Jan 5 (Reuters) - About a dozen oil tankers loaded with Venezuelan crude and fuel have left the country's waters since the start of the year in apparent defiance of the U.S. government's blockade on exports, according to documents seen by Reuters and industry sources including monitoring service TankerTrackers.com.\n\nU.S. President Donald ​Trump imposed a blockade of all sanctioned tankers bound for Venezuela in mid-December, before the dramatic capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by U.S. troops in ‌the early hours of Saturday morning. Trump said on Saturday that an oil embargo remained in full force after Maduro's extraction.\n\nAll the departed vessels identified are under sanctions and most are now sailing on the high seas ‌without any known flag or current ship safety documentation in place, shipping data showed. Half of them are supertankers that typically carry Venezuelan crude to China, according to TankerTrackers.com and shipping documents from PDVSA.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the U.S. had approved or allowed the shipments. Trump also said on Saturday that Venezuela's largest customers, including China, would keep receiving oil.\n\nA U.S. official told Reuters on Monday the vessel \"quarantine\" was in effect focused on sanctioned tankers, but did not elaborate on the departed ships.\n\nThe White House, the U.S. State Department, state-run Venezuelan oil company PDVSA ⁠and Venezuela's oil ministry did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe ‌vessels are carrying an estimated volume of 12 million barrels of Venezuelan heavy crude and fuel oil, according to deals negotiated with PDVSA and satellite images analyzed by TankerTrackers.com.\n\nIt was unclear where the vessels were heading. When they loaded in December, they were mostly destined for Asia. ‍The ships had been stuck in Venezuelan waters since due to the U.S. blockade.\n\nA separate group of three smaller empty ships, also under sanctions, left the country after completing domestic trips or discharging imports, including of Russian naphtha.\n\nAt least four of the departed tankers left Venezuelan waters on Saturday through a route north of Margarita island after briefly stopping near the country's maritime border, TankerTrackers.com said.\n\nAt least four supertankers ​had been cleared by Venezuelan authorities to leave in dark mode, three sources with knowledge of the departure paperwork told Reuters. That means the vessels sail without their ‌satellite tracking devices switched on, a common ploy for tankers in the global fleet that carry sanctioned oil from Venezuela, Iran and Russia around the world.",

    "description": "As a registered dietitian who follows the Mediterranean diet but dislikes cooking, I use low-effort Trader Joe's staples to make easy meals or snacks.",
    "fullText": "When I tell people I've been a registered dietitian for more than 20 years, the assumption is that I love to eat nutritious foods and cook them myself.\n\nI try to mostly eat balanced and nutrient-dense meals that follow the Mediterranean diet — which focuses on consuming lots of whole grains and produce while limiting red meats and processed foods — but I don't enjoy spending time planning, cooking, and cleaning.\n\nThankfully, Trader Joe's has some gems that help me feed my entire family (including a picky child).\n\nHere are some of my must-buy items that I use to help create healthy and easy meals without spending too much time in the kitchen.\n\nEditor's Note: Product price and availability may vary.\n\nEnvy apples can be added to salads, \"girl dinners,\" or lunchboxes for an extra crunch, a boost of fiber, and balanced sweetness.\n\nThey're appealing because their insides tend to stay whiter longer, allowing for slicing or chopping without worrying too much about being stuck with discolored fruit.\n\nSalmon from Norway is known for its pure taste, beautiful color, and firm flesh. Much of that is due to its balanced fat content and firm texture.\n\nIt's also nutrient-dense, providing essentials such as omega-3; vitamins D, B12, and A; and selenium. Plus, it's incredibly easy to cook, especially if I remember to marinate it the night before.\n\nI don't follow a vegan diet, but that doesn't stop me from purchasing this plant-based pesto from Trader Joe's to use on pasta dishes, sandwiches, or as a dip.\n\nContaining kale, cashew, and basil, this pesto is also my secret ingredient in killer grilled-cheese sandwiches.\n\nIf it were socially acceptable to drink Trader Joe's vegan creamy dill dressing with a straw, I'd do it. I love that it's free from fillers or emulsifiers, and the flavor is incredibly satisfying.\n\nThe obvious way to enjoy this dressing is on top of a salad. However, I also use it as a saucy addition to chicken or fish meals, an ingredient in grain-based dishes, and a condiment on sandwiches.\n\nNot loving to cook also means not loving to prep snacks. However, because I lead an active lifestyle, I know I need to fuel myself with nutrients such as sustainable carbohydrates before starting a workout.\n\nClif Bars are crafted with a blend of plant-based protein, fat, and carbohydrates. They're my favorite pre-workout snack that requires zero effort in the kitchen.\n\nThis frozen blend of blueberries, bananas, strawberries, dragon fruit, spinach, and kale makes smoothie-making so easy.\n\nThere's no chopping or prepping required when I'm in the mood for a breakfast smoothie — I simply toss some of this into a blender with milk.\n\nVeggies are a must at dinnertime in my house. Having prewashed and cut veggie and produce kits, such as the Trader Joe's asparagus sauté with mushrooms and onions, makes cooking dinner a breeze.\n\nSimply open the package and sauté everything in some extra-virgin olive oil.\n\nWhole grains can be both nutritious and filling. For those who don't like spending too much time in the kitchen, cooking them can be a tedious task.\n\nPrecooked frozen grains, such as Trader Joe's bulgur pilaf with squash and feta, only need to be heated through. Plus, this one is made with butternut squash, and I like the boost of veggies in every bite.\n\nTrader Joe's frozen precooked cauliflower rice is a perfect base for a low-carb meal. I just add a protein to make it a more complete dish.\n\nFor people who don't love cauliflower rice — but tolerate it because they want to include more veggies in their diet (such as my husband) — mixing this dish with some regular rice can offer the best of both worlds.\n\nPrecooked and shelled hard-boiled eggs make for an easy breakfast protein, salad topping, or sandwich addition.\n\nYes, even dietitians want to have pizza night once in a while.\n\nTrader Joe's frozen Tarte au Brie et aux Tomates satisfies the fiercest pizza craving. Plus, heating it up takes less time than we'd spend waiting for a pie to be delivered from the local pizzeria.\n\nI enjoy one serving as a main course, accompanied by a side salad, for a complete meal.\n\nClick to keep reading Trader Joe's diaries like this one.\n\nThis story was originally published on September 25, 2023, and most recently updated on January 5, 2025.",

    "description": "I followed a partner to Texas from California, then left both the state and relationship. I learned an important lesson about making my own decisions.",
    "fullText": "Shortly after earning my Bachelor's degree, I did what any confused 21-year-old would do: I moved to be with a partner.\n\nThe decision surprised a lot of people in my life. My dad raised his eyebrows at my choice to move for love and to make Texas my home.\n\nAfter all, I'd always dreamed of moving to New York, where I'd launch my writing career.\n\nHowever, moving to Texas seemed like a good option at the time. It's where my long-distance partner was living and working, and I was fresh out of college and eager to leave my California hometown.\n\nLooking back now, I was leaning on a romanticized version of what moving would mean — a fresh start and a deepening of our LDR — instead of thinking about what I really wanted.\n\nI arrived in northern Texas during a mid-summer nightmare of humidity. I couldn't walk outside without feeling like I'd just entered a sauna — a sharp contrast to California's dry heat.\n\nFrom the very beginning, I tried to find community and make living here work, convincing myself I'd adjust if I just put in enough effort.\n\nBut I had a tough time finding things to do in my new suburb. Quiet nights and weekends left me daydreaming about New York City and its seemingly endless array of activities and events even more.\n\nCrucially, I also found it incredibly difficult to meet anyone who felt similar to me.\n\nMy Dallas suburb felt much more conservative than my California hometown, and a lot of the people in our neighborhood were avid churchgoers, whereas I'm not religious.\n\nAround this time, too, I was coming to terms with the fact that I also liked women romantically. I struggled to find the kinds of queer spaces that seemed more plentiful in larger cities and bluer states.\n\nAs much as I tried to appreciate the mountainless views and endless selection of barbecue, I struggled to connect with my new town — and I couldn't stop thinking about the life I wanted in New York.\n\nSix months in, I took a quick trip back to California to visit my dad.\n\nTaking some time away from Texas made me confront the truth: I couldn't stay there anymore.\n\nThroughout my entire time in the state, I'd been daydreaming about packing up my things and living in New York City. My partner, on the other hand, wanted life in the country, and we just ended up not being compatible.\n\nThe Lone Star State helped bring all of these realizations to light.\n\nI knew that if I had chosen to stay, I'd continue to feel like a stranger in my own life. I realized that I'd rather take on the \"sunk cost\" of moving than stay in a place and relationship that didn't suit me.\n\nI learned a lot about myself during this time — including the fact that, maybe unsurprisingly, a suburb in northern Texas was not a great long-term fit for me. The biggest lesson I learned, though, was never to give up my own hopes and dreams for the sake of a relationship.\n\nDon't get me wrong: Moving for a partner can work for some people, but at 21, I learned the importance of making life decisions with my own wants and needs in mind.\n\nNow, almost a decade later, I'm writing this from my New York City apartment. I'm in a city where I've found my purpose, the love of my life, and most importantly, happiness.\n\nLeaving Texas turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made.",

    "fullText": "Celebrities are kicking off 2026 in dramatic fashion — literally.\n\nOn Sunday night, Hollywood stars flocked to Santa Monica for the 2026 Critics Choice Awards, which celebrate the best of film and TV.\n\nSome attendees, such as Ariana Grande, stood out in glamorous, sparkling ensembles, while others fell short with lackluster looks.\n\nThese are the best and worst outfits we saw.\n\nThe \"Sentimental Value\" star hit the red carpet in a sleeveless gown designed by Ralph Lauren.\n\nThe shimmering dress had thin straps, a plunging cowl neckline, and a form-fitting skirt that extended into a short train.\n\nFanning stood out in the elegant gown, which perfectly complemented her blonde hair and neutral makeup.\n\nShe wore a strapless, sparkle-covered gown with a structured bodice and ruched fabric across its floor-length skirt.\n\nIts shape worked strongly for the actor, but its gray-toned color washed her out. A brighter silver or gold coloring might have worked better.\n\nIt also would've been fun to see Silverstone wear her hair in an updo to highlight her diamond earrings and statement dress.\n\nThe \"Andor\" actor arrived at the Critics Choice Awards wearing a forest green suit and undershirt.\n\nThough the outfit's earthy colors looked great on Luna, its satin pieces fit loosely and seemed to need some tailoring. His pants, especially, looked too long.\n\nThe outfit was also very understated and could have been enhanced with some accessories, such as rings or a brooch.\n\nThey coordinated in all-black ensembles that showcased their respective styles.\n\nRei Ami donned a velvet gown with a dramatic bodice cutout and wrist accessories from Chochengco, while Ejae had a glamorous moment in a strapless, satin ball gown.\n\nAudrey Nuna took the most daring approach, wearing a sculptural sphere piece from Marc Jacobs.\n\nSaint Laurent designed her dramatic look. It featured a tan suit, a massive feather boa across her shoulders, black gloves, a red tie, and leather boots that extended up her thighs.\n\nA simpler pair of shoes, such as boots that sat under her pant legs, would have probably looked better with the outfit.\n\nLaw Roach and Yvonne Shelly styled Grande for the Critics Choice Awards in a custom Alberta Ferretti gown designed by Lorenzo Serafini.\n\nThe baby-pink gown featured a scooped neckline, a form-fitting bodice, and a floor-length, slightly poofy skirt. A sheer overlay, covered in sparkly embellishments, sat atop the dress and formed a cape in the back.\n\nGrande wore her hair up and paired the statement gown with Swarovski jewelry. The look was the perfect blend of red-carpet glam and an homage to her portrayal of Glinda in \"Wicked: For Good.\"\n\nThe \"Severance\" star's gold-toned gown had a structured bodice with ruching on the center and sides, as well as two diagonal straps that crisscrossed across her upper chest. The texture continued on the full skirt, bringing dimension to the look.\n\nHowever, Arquette added a black belt and black wrap to the look, which felt distracting against the shiny fabric of the dress. The look would have been stronger if she had gone in a different direction with her accessories.\n\nInfiniti, who was nominated for her performance in \"One Battle After Another,\" arrived at the Critics Choice Awards in a yellow set designed by Louis Vuitton.\n\nThe top had a high neckline, while the cropped bodice was rounded with ruched fabric. The back of the top was the same shape but scooped lower, forming a cape that flowed to her calves. A form-fitting skirt with a subtle train matched the top.\n\nInfiniti, who shared on Instagram that the yellow of her outfit is her favorite color, paired the look with diamond jewelry.\n\nJordan selected a burgundy Louis Vuitton suit for the event. The jacket was double-breasted, while the pants were slim-fitted. He paired the bold suit with a pink shirt and a slightly shiny burgundy tie, as well as Christian Louboutin shoes.\n\nThe outfit may have also subtly nodded to \"Sinners,\" for which Jordan was nominated for best actor, as one of the twins he portrays, Stack, wears a similar shade of red throughout the film.\n\nDesigned by Bottega Veneta, Elordi's black suit had a subtly asymmetrical design with the jacket buttoning at an angle. Both the jacket and pants had a relaxed fit, adding to the effortlessly cool feel of the ensemble.\n\nThe \"Frankenstein\" star paired the suit with a black shirt, a gray tie, and black shoes. His sunglasses added a pop of color to the monotone outfit, as they had red lenses.",

    "title": "'I am innocent': Maduro pleads not guilty to narco-terrorism charges in first court appearance",
    "description": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had a lot to say during his first Manhattan federal court appearance.",
    "fullText": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro defiantly proclaimed his innocence in a Manhattan federal court Monday morning during his and his wife's first public appearance since US forces captured them in a dramatic military raid on Caracas over the weekend.\n\n\"I am innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man. I am still president of my country,\" Maduro told the judge through an interpreter when asked for his plea on narco-terrorism and weapons charges.\n\nHe was then interrupted by the judge, who interjected, \"A not guilty plea will be entered on behalf of Mr. Maduro.\"\n\nIt was one of several dramatic moments during the roughly 30-minute hearing, which Maduro used to protest his capture by US forces.\n\nWhen he entered the courtroom, flanked by US marshals, he wished everyone a \"Happy New Year\" in English and locked eyes with members of the press sitting in the back of the courtroom.\n\nLater, as the hearing wrapped up, a person sitting in the fourth row of the courtroom gallery stood to say Maduro would pay in the name of the Venezuelan people.\n\n\"I am a man of God, and I am a war prisoner,\" Maduro responded in Spanish as US marshals escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nMaduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were arraigned on an indictment alleging a conspiracy to import cocaine and a related conspiracy to possess machine guns and other \"destructive devices\" in furtherance of drug trafficking. Maduro also faces a narco-terrorism conspiracy charge.\n\nThe two wore standard-issue jail garb of navy smocks over orange long-sleeve shirts with khaki pants. At their seats in the courtroom, they wore headphones to listen to their court-appointed translators.\n\nWhen he stood to address the judge, Maduro held on to the arms of his chair as he rose unsteadily. Flores, her blonde hair tied back in a bun, had several small bandages on her face. She sustained injuries during her \"abduction\" in Caracas, one of her attorneys said.\n\nDuring the packed noon hearing, US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein read the couple a summary of their charges and informed the Venezuelan president and first lady of their rights before the pair entered not guilty pleas. He addressed them as \"Mr. Maduro\" and \"Ms. Flores.\"\n\nWhen asked to confirm his identity at the start of the hearing, Maduro began by stating in firmly spoken Spanish that he is \"Presidente constitutional de la Republica Venezuela.\"\n\n\"I am here, kidnapped, since January 3, Saturday,\" Maduro said. I was captured in my home in Caracas, Venezuela.\"\n\n\"There will be a time and place to go into all this,\" the judge interrupted.\n\nAsked for her plea, Flores spoke in a quiet, hoarse voice.\n\n\"Not guilty. Completely innocent,\" she said through a court interpreter.\n\nBoth Maduro and Flores are facing health issues and will need medical attention while awaiting trial, their lawyers said.\n\n\"Miss Flores, during her abduction, sustained significant injuries, as you can see today here in court,\" defense lawyer Mark Donnelly told the judge. \"There's a belief that she may have a fracture or severe bruising on her ribs,\" the lawyer added.\n\nThe 25-page indictment filed against Maduro, his wife, son, and three others alleges that for over 25 years, Venezuelan leaders \"have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States.\"\n\nMaduro was represented in court by Barry Pollack, an attorney best known for also representing WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange. Flores was represented by the Texas-based attorney Mark Donnelly and one of his law partners, Andres Sanchez.\n\nThe attorneys said they would not seek bail for Maduro or Flores on Monday, but reserved the right to seek it at a later date. Pollack told Hellerstein he anticipated \"voluminous and complicated legal practice.\"\n\n\"Mr. Maduro is the head of a sovereign state,\" Pollack said. \"He is entitled to the privileges and immunities that go with that office. In addition, there are issues about the legality of this military abduction.\"\n\nHellerstein scheduled the next court hearing for March 17.\n\nMaduro has long been a target of the US Justice Department. Manhattan federal prosecutors first indicted him in 2020, accusing him of heading the drug-trafficking network, the Cartel de los Soles.\n\nIn 2015, the nephews of Maduro's wife, Flores, were arrested in Haiti and charged with drug trafficking by the same office handling the Maduro case.\n\nThe indictment says Maduro is \"at the forefront of that corruption and has partnered with his co-conspirators to use his illegally obtained authority and the institutions he corroded to transport thousands of tons of cocaine to the United States.\"\n\nOn Saturday, President Donald Trump said the US captured the Venezuelan president following large-scale strikes on the South American nation.\n\nTrump said the US will \"run\" Venezuela until a \"safe, proper, and judicious transition\" can be facilitated. It remains unclear how the Trump administration would carry out this plan and for how long.",

    "description": "After moving from West Virginia to Miami in South Florida a few years ago, I've fallen in love with the great weather and budget travel deals.",
    "fullText": "Throughout my childhood, my family barely strayed from the parts of West Virginia's Appalachia region where I was born and raised.\n\nI spent college two hours away in Ohio, and during those years, I started traveling around the United States and to more distant places in Europe and Latin America.\n\nI love exploring the world, so when it was time to graduate and start a life somewhere new, I applied to jobs all around the country.\n\nI took the first one I could get, and it happened to be in Miami. I'd never been to Florida before, but I quickly found things in Dade County I enjoyed.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of living here, there are three big things I love about living in Miami — and one thing I still miss about West Virginia.\n\nA lot of people have opinions about this one, but as someone who grew up in a colder climate, I much prefer Miami weather.\n\nSummer aside, most weeks are sunny and fairly comfortable with a lot of days between 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Winters are pleasantly short, sunny, and warm.\n\nI also struggle with depression, which can be impacted by the seasons, so having the ability to go outside and get some sunshine any time of the year is a major bonus for me.\n\nThough summertime in Miami can be uncomfortably hot and humid and hurricane season is no joke, I still prefer the weather here to any place that experiences a harsher winter.\n\nAs a travel writer, I'm constantly booking trips and visiting new cities and countries. And when I'm not hopping on a plane or road tripping to a different part of Florida, I can still experience a variety of communities and cultures in Miami.\n\nMost people know Miami for its Cuban influence, but the city is also home to a huge variety of expats from other parts of Latin America, like Colombia, Venezuela and Argentina.\n\nThere's also a lot of diversity from other parts of the world, too. For example, Miami Beach has one of the largest Jewish populations outside of Israel, and there's also a huge variety of Bahamian, Jamaican and other Caribbean cultures here.\n\nMiami is constantly growing and changing, and I love that I can learn about so many different cultures without traveling too far.\n\nOne of my favorite perks of living in Miami truly is how easy and convenient it is to travel from the city.\n\nFor starters, there are two major airports nearby — Miami International Airport (MIA) and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL).\n\nMiami is also the cruise capital of the world, and there are constantly ships sailing from the ports in Miami and Fort Lauderdale.\n\nI'm a budget traveler at heart, and I've scored some incredible travel deals from South Florida. I regularly find flights to Europe for less than $400 from these airports, and I can fly to many places around the US for less than $150.\n\nSince I moved to Florida, I've developed a deep appreciation for the beach. However, I still definitely miss the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nThey're the oldest mountain range in the United States, and these rolling hills are the perfect place for exploring. My favorite time to visit West Virginia is in the late spring or early summer when the trees are at their fullest and brightest.\n\nPalm trees are beautiful, but I definitely miss how serene and peaceful nature can be in West Virginia — especially when compared to how busy and chaotic Miami can feel sometimes.",

    "description": "TheBurntPeanut, a foul-mouthed virtual peanut that plays \"Arc Raiders,\" is wildly popular on Twitch — and estimated to earn over $120,000 a month.",
    "fullText": "A new star has emerged on Twitch: a video game-playing peanut with eyes and lips.\n\nMen across America spent their holiday time off tuning into the hourslong livestreams of TheBurntPeanut. The foul-mouthed legume plays the video game \"Arc Raiders\" while cracking jokes and loving \"goop,\" his term for the virtual loot found in the popular game.\n\nTheBurntPeanut is a VTuber, a type of streamer who conceals their identity using a virtual avatar. There's a long history of these animated gamers, including Twitch giants like Ironmouse.\n\nBut the small animated peanut has grown large in viewership, touting 1.4 million followers on Twitch, 1.1 million on YouTube, and over 750,000 on TikTok.\n\nHere's what you need to know about that peanut your boyfriend, brother, or cousin was raving about over the holidays.\n\nLike many on Twitch, TheBurntPeanut streams for long stretches — often over seven hours at a time — while playing the popular game \"Arc Raiders.\" It's not unusual for 75,000-plus concurrent fans to tune in to watch him dancing, chatting, and cursing out his competitors while gaming.\n\nThe man behind TheBurntPeanut has not yet disclosed his name or appearance. That's a long-standing tradition for some gamers, who often show their screens instead of their own faces, and especially for VTubers. (Think back to 2022, when the YouTuber Dream famously revealed his face.)\n\nTheBurntPeanut does show his actual eyes and lips, which allows him to show emotion. (This should be familiar to any fans of the Annoying Orange.) His peanut body also moves as if it was speaking.\n\nFans of TheBurntPeanut are called \"bungulators\" — and there are a lot of them. According to Stream Charts, TheBurntPeanut was the No. 1 Twitch streamer ranked by hours-watched between December 6 and January 4. In that period, he clocked 9.2 million hours watched on the platform.\n\nMuch of TheBurntPeanut's humor leans on the crass side. He claims that he's been banned from TikTok 47 times. He leans into his character, joking about not having arms and legs, and about eating his family for munching on fries cooked in peanut oil.\n\nAt the December Streamer Awards, TheBurntPeanut took home the prize of Best VTuber, beating industry stalwarts like Ironmouse and Mori Calliope. His win stirred up controversy, as TheBurntPeanut calls himself a \"PTuber\" and does not associate with the traditional, anime-style VTubers that built the category.\n\nVTubers are often cash drivers, with a management industry forming around the streamers. TheBurntPeanut's paid subscribers are split into three tiers: $5.99, $9.99, and $24.99 a month.\n\nStream Charts estimates that TheBurntPeanut counts over 40,000 active subscribers in the first tier, with 84 and 63 active subscribers in the second and third tiers. The firm estimates his 30-day income to be between $129,427 and $201,874.\n\nOn YouTube, fans can support streamers by sending paid \"super chats.\" Playboard estimates that TheBurntPeanut received 985 super chats in the last 7 days, amounting to $12,325.\n\nBefore he became a streamer, TheBurntPeanut said that he worked as a phone salesman. He earned about $600 every two weeks, he said.\n\n\"I've just been so blessed by the Bungulators,\" he said. \"Every day, I wake up, and I thank God that I have what I have.\"\n\nAs TheBurntPeanut's popularity surged in December, so did a spin-off genre of TikTok: complaints and jokes from his fans' partners.\n\nIn one video, a woman said TheBurntPeanut made her boyfriend laugh more than she could. In another, a woman wrote that she sometimes thinks her boyfriend loves TheBurntPeanut more than her.\n\nOne woman recorded herself repeatedly asking why she was \"falling asleep to a peanut.\" She captioned it: \"I am a victim.\"\n\nEnjoy me crashing out over @theburntpeanut because in the past week he’s taken over our household. I’ve woken up to his voice on our bedroom TV at 3am more than once. “His presence is soothing to me” —my fiancé, mid-nap at his own birthday party🎈asleep to burnt peanut 🙃🫠 #boythings #wtf #burntpeanut #christmasparty #holidays\n\nOthers are bonding over TheBurntPeanut. One woman posted about joining her husband to watch the \"little sassy peanut.\" Another wrote that her fiancé got her watching TheBurntPeanut — but that she now watches solo of her own free will.\n\nThe streamers' fans aren't all men, of course. One woman on TikTok described watching TheBurntPeanut as part of her \"night routine.\" The clip now has over 300,000 views. One family rang in the New Year watching TheBurntPeanut on their television.\n\nThese TikToks are a sign of how pervasive one small peanut has become — and how meteoric his rise has been. So if you see a peanut on the TV when you enter a restaurant, now you know why.",

Maduro appears to be wearing a gray Nike Tech fleece set in the picture.\n\nFollowing the January 3 post, searches for \"Nike Tech\" on Google spiked, according to Google Trends.\n\nThe online conversations about the athleisure line also surged dramatically on X, intelligence platform PeakMetrics told Business Insider. Nike Tech was mentioned in over 5,000 X posts a day between January 3 and January 5, according to PeakMetrics. That's up from the roughly 325 posts a day it averaged from November 1 to December 31.\n\nOn TikTok, users posted AI-generated versions of the photo and poked fun at the fashion choice. Some users joked that it was a new Nike campaign. Others made \"steal the look\" posts that broke down the cost of the full outfit, including the darkened eye mask and ear covering. The jacket and joggers cost over $200 combined.\n\nVENEZUELAN PRESIDENT PUT IN NIKE TECH,SHIPPED TO NEW YORKI #venezuela #president #fyp #news #update\n\nAs of Monday morning, the style of the Nike Tech fleece zip-up jacket that Maduro was photographed in was sold out on Nike's US website in several sizes.\n\nThe fleece jacket already appeared to be a hot item before Maduro donned it on the Navy ship USS Iwo Jima. It appeared to be partially sold out in November and December, according to screenshots archived on Wayback Machine.\n\nIt's been the subject of a viral debate in recent weeks, with some young men bragging on social media about being \"team Nike Tech\" or \"team quarter-zip\" to show whether they're a part of Corporate America or not.\n\nSome members of Gen Z and Gen Alpha also had their eyes on Nike Tech for the holidays. A clip of a girl opening her Christmas gift, a Nike Tech set, garnered over 1 million likes on TikTok and earned a comment from Nike itself.\n\nNike also made its way onto teens' wish lists this year, and it dominated Piper Sandler's semi-annual teen survey as the No. 1 clothing brand in fall 2025.\n\nMaduro, the longtime Venezuelan leader, and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured in an overnight raid in Caracas over the weekend and taken to the US, where Maduro faces federal charges.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has dunked on one of his key allies for not groveling hard enough to praise him in the aftermath of his shock invasion of Venezuela over the weekend.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham seemed eager to please when he told the president aboard Air Force One on Sunday night that “when you first got elected in January, we made the biggest comeback ever.”\n\nBut the 79-year-old MAGA leader was apparently not impressed.\n\n“You think so, really? I didn‘t feel it was a comeback, actually,” Trump shot back, apparently offended by Graham forgetting that the 2020 election, by his account, was “rigged.”\n\nThe South Carolina Republican was quick to move the conversation on.\n\n“The bottom line is, we have a drug caliphate in our backyard,” Graham said.\n\nThe exchange took place as the president traveled back to the White House from his resort in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, where he’s understood to have watched a livestream of Saturday night’s capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nGraham had already sung Trump’s praises over that seizure, decried by critics as an illegal assault on the rules-based international order, during a Fox News appearance late Sunday.\n\n“The military operation in Venezuela showed America at her best, all thanks to our incredible men and women in uniform,” the senator wrote in an X post, sharing a clip from that interview. “Maduro miscalculated our Commander in Chief, and President [Donald Trump] made clear he will not be trifled with.”",

    "description": "US stocks, gold, and bitcoin pushed past the latest geopolitical turmoil on Monday. Conflicts over the years have been mostly shrugged off by investors.",
    "fullText": "A new geopolitical conflict is unfolding. Yet, US stocks are… up at new record highs?\n\nThat's the dynamic on display on Monday as investors digest the US's raid on Venezuela and the capture of the nation's president, Nicolás Maduro, over the weekend.\n\nDespite the upheaval of its South American neighbor, US stocks, gold, and bitcoin were among risk assets that churned higher on Monday. As far as markets are concerned, the Venezuela situation seems to already be an afterthought.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed 0.6%, while the Dow's 1.3% jump notched a record closing high for the benchmark. Energy stocks led the way across both indexes.\n\nThose moves seem counterintuitive, but they reflect a dynamic that markets have shown time and time again over the decades: investors simply don't care that much about conflict abroad.\n\nStocks, for one, have a pattern of falling as geopolitical tensions rise, but rebounding once the conflict actually occurs. According to an analysis by Fundstrat Research, there are at least five instances where equities rallied after a major geopolitical event, such as the first Gulf War or when Hamas attacked Israel in 2023.\n\n\"The old adage has long been to 'sell the rumor, buy the invasion,'\" Kent Fung, Fundstrat's vice president of market intelligence, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nPeter Berezin, the chief market strategist at BCA Research, said Monday's rally showed investors are more focused on taking the weekend's string of events in a \"positive light.\"\n\n\"You had a country that has been hostile to the US that has expropriated a lot of US investments, and now Trump has orchestrated a regime shift that could open the country up for new investment,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe lack of a negative reaction in markets could also reflect how investors can't yet price in a final outcome of the US-Venezuela conflict. The market also seems to be focused on other recent stock drivers, such as the rally broadening out to sectors beyond tech, Berezin said.\n\nThe market's upward momentum is proving to be a tough force to stop. US equities notched another record-setting year in 2025, with the S&P 500 gaining 16% as investors remained laser-focused on the growth potential of AI, strong earnings, rate cuts, and a still-resilient US economy.\n\n\"Solid results almost across the board\" last year have caused investor confidence to be \"reasonably strong,\" Nicholas Colas, the co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note on Monday.\n\n\"From a mechanical standpoint, the global macro backdrop looks essentially unchanged,\" Karl Schamotta, the chief market strategist at Corpay, wrote in a note detailing how investors largely took the Venezuela situation \"in stride.\"\n\nIf anything, investors are more likely to care about the coming December jobs report, Schamotta added, which could influence the market's expectations for interest rate cuts in 2026.",

    "description": "As a Pilates instructor of 13 years, I see many first-time students make the same mistakes, from wearing the wrong clothes to not eating before class.",
    "fullText": "I became a Pilates instructor 13 years ago after reformer classes helped me recover from a severe back injury.\n\nNowadays, I teach 20 group equipment classes weekly and see about 100 clients over seven days. With that many students, it's no surprise I see new clients make the same mistakes over and over.\n\nHere are the five most common mistakes I see students make during their first few Pilates classes.\n\nI recommend new clients arrive at the studio at least 10 minutes before class so that I have time to fit them into the equipment.\n\nFor example, the Reformer carriage must be adjusted to fit their unique body type, height, and overall proportions. I also ensure the straps are even and at the correct length for the client.\n\nArriving ahead of schedule allows students to get settled and stay focused during class.\n\nPilates classes involve verbal cueing, which means most teachers will describe the exercises instead of demonstrating them. However, following oral instructions can be particularly challenging for non-auditory learners.\n\nFor example, when doing reformer Pilates classes, the springs can be adjusted to increase or decrease resistance. Many first-timers attend Pilates classes with a gym mindset, assuming heavier loads produce the best results.\n\nHowever, when taking a class, you should never ignore the instructor's directions on how much resistance to use. Following directions is essential for staying safe and seeing results.\n\nPilates uses a technique known as lateral breathing to stabilize the trunk (chest, abdomen, pelvis, and back) while you move. This helps prevent unwanted pelvis movement or an arched back.\n\nGood form during exercise allows for proper muscle recruitment and helps prevent injuries, which is why I always remind my students to be mindful of their breath.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that engaging your core and developing breathing techniques takes time. When in doubt, stick to your usual breathing pattern.\n\nMost studios require clients to wear socks with proper grips on the bottom for safety and hygiene purposes.\n\nYour feet may get slippery during movements requiring extra stability, so I recommend wearing them even if the studio doesn't mandate it.\n\nIt's also important to avoid wearing loose-fitting clothing so the instructor can see your body and help you make the proper adjustments.\n\nAdditionally, it's best to keep long hair in a bun so it doesn't get caught in the springs or other parts of the equipment.\n\nTaking a Pilates class on an empty stomach is a big no-no. However, you also don't want to feel too full before class since Pilates is a core-centered workout.\n\nI recommend eating something light an hour before class. A protein shake or a rice cake with peanut butter are good options if you're taking an early class.\n\nFor those who prefer to exercise on their lunch break, a small salad with light protein will do the trick. The most important thing, however, is to listen to your body and find what works for you.\n\nThis story was originally published on August 28, 2024, and most recently updated on January 5, 2025.",

    "title": "This Is How Long It Takes to Recover From the ‘Super Flu,’ According to Doctors",
    "description": "The flu is a serious illness, and recovery can take time.",
    "fullText": "It’s one thing to hear about cases of the so-called “super flu” skyrocketing in the country, but it’s another to actually deal with it. If you’ve recently experienced the flu, you may be wondering when you’ll feel like yourself again. Unfortunately, doctors say it can take time.\n\nThe flu can cause uncomfortable symptoms like fever, cough, and sore throat when you’re initially sick, but you may also be sidelined with lingering fatigue and generally feeling off after your original symptoms have cleared. “Once influenza grabs you, it can hold onto you for a longer period of time than the acute illness,” William Schaffner, MD, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tells SELF.\n\nOkay, but why? And, ballpark, how long are we talking about here? This is how long it takes to recover from the “super flu,” according to doctors, plus what you can do to speed up your recovery.\n\nThe flu has always been a potentially serious illness. But the strain of the flu that’s circulating right now—which is called subclade K—is a strong version of the virus that is better at evading the previous immunity you might have, whether it’s from the flu vaccine or having had other versions of the flu. As a result, more people are vulnerable to getting infected and feeling horrible for longer than usual when they get sick.\n\nIt’s too early to have data on how long most people are sick with subclade K, but Dr. Schaffner says he’s heard anecdotes of this strain causing illness that lasts longer than your typical flu. “The dominant strain out there is part of the H3N2 family, and that usually causes more severe illness,” he says.\n\nIt’s tough for doctors to say exactly how long it will take for you to feel better when you have the flu, given that things like your individual immune response and underlying health conditions come into play. But there is a ballpark that you can expect.\n\n“While the acute symptoms such as fever might abate in a few days, fatigue and [feeling off] may persist for a week or longer,” Amesh A. Adalja, MD, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, tells SELF. There are a few reasons for this. “The virus sets up an inflammatory response—that’s how the body fights off the virus,” Dr. Schaffner says. But after the initial illness starts to fade, that inflammation can keep going and continue to fuel symptoms like a sore throat, dry cough, and just generally feeling lousy, he says. “That undoubtedly can last for a while,” Dr. Schaffner says.\n\nBeing dehydrated and moving less than usual (because you’re not feeling great) can also slow down the recovery process, Dr. Adalja says. There’s even something called long influenza syndrome that some people experience, he points out. (Think long COVID, but with the flu.)\n\nEven though early data suggests that this year’s flu vaccine isn’t as effective at preventing the flu, Dr. Adalja says that being vaccinated is likely to help you recover faster.\n\nIf you didn’t get your flu shot, there’s no reason to harp on it—that won’t help you now. But regardless of your vaccination status, doctors say there are a few things you can do to try to speed up your recovery time or at least feel better while you ride things out.\n\nThe first is to ask your healthcare provider about taking an antiviral treatment like oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza). “If you start an antiviral early, it reduces the severity of the illness,” Dr. Schaffner says.\n\nThere is a caveat to keep in mind that your healthcare provider may flag: Oseltamivir can cause “fairly prominent” side effects like nausea and vomiting, Dr. Schaffner says. “Pediatricians are a little more careful about that,” he says. “But for people in high-risk groups for severe disease, including older persons, those who are immune compromised, and those who are pregnant, we unhesitantly recommend using the medication.”\n\nBeyond that, both doctors agree that staying well hydrated is crucial. “Make sure you keep up with your fluids,” Dr. Schaffner says. “If you let yourself get dehydrated, you’re more likely to get pneumonia.” Not only that, being well hydrated will keep your mucus membranes moist and make it easier to get out nasal discharge, making you feel less stuffy, Dr. Schaffner says.\n\nWhile Dr. Adalja says you don’t want to overexert yourself when you’re in the initial phase of being sick, moving once you’re in the recovery phase is important. “Sit up, walk around, and start moving as much as possible,” Dr. Schaffner says. “Your body will appreciate that.” At the same time, he stresses the importance of getting a good night’s sleep to give your body plenty of opportunity to rest and recover.\n\nBut while you’re doing all of that, it’s important to keep flu complications like pneumonia on the back burner. “If a person has unremitting fever, shortness of breath, or extreme fatigue that prohibits them from performing their activities of daily living, they should see a medical provider,” Dr. Adalja says. (Dr. Schaffner also recommends being on the lookout for yellow or green phlegm—this can be a sign of pneumonia too.)\n\n“If you’re more than a week out from the acute illness and you’re not getting better or even feeling worse, it’s time to contact your doctor,” Dr. Schaffner says. But if you feel like you’re getting better—just at a slower pace than you’d hope—he recommends being patient. The flu is a serious illness, and recovery can take time.\n\nThis Year’s Flu Is Different.

Trump arrived in Palm Beach County early on Dec. 20 for a 15-day stay and returned to Washington, D.C., via an airbase in Maryland on Sunday evening.",
    "fullText": "A hapless Donald Trump made a show of the Air Force One stairs as he stepped off the presidential jet after a two-week stay at his Mar-a-Lago bolthole.\n\nTrump arrived in Palm Beach County early on Dec. 20 for a 15-day stay and returned to Washington, D.C., via an airbase in Maryland on Sunday evening. But as he descended the steps of AF1 to board Marine One for his onward journey, several possible tell-tale signs of weakness became apparent.\n\nThe Daily Beast has dutifully reported on the waning physical power of the 79-year-old president, with major players such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal joining the conversation later. Trump admitted to the latter that he has sought medical help for a myriad of issues.\n\nIn that unusually candid interview last week, he conceded that he visited Walter Reed Military Medical Center in mid-July after suffering “mild swelling” in his lower legs and said an ultrasound showed he has “chronic venous insufficiency,” a common ailment in older people that makes it more difficult for the blood to travel to the heart from the legs through smaller veins.\n\nThis, perhaps, contributed to Trump making the relatively simple task of walking down some steps and then in a straight line, and then up some even smaller steps, look like a gargantuan effort.\n\nTV footage captured the charade. Trump is seen emerging from the door of the jet before gripping the handrail and appearing to let his legs drop abruptly onto the steps. He gingerly descends before pawing for a second handrail as his eyes remain fixed on the red carpet in front of him.\n\nHis hair comedically flaps in the wind as he takes on the second portion of the stairs, even slower than the first. He steps out onto the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews and takes a breather, saluting the gathered officials and waving to the press.\n\nHe then embarks on a long arc towards Marine One, where he veers wildly to the left of the door, stopping for chats along the way. The short walk, in which he also drags his right leg, takes what feels like an age. He appears jaded as he ascends the tiny staircase into the chopper, which brought him back to the White House.\n\nTrump has made a hash of the AF1 steps plenty of times in the past and more frequently of late. In a video showing such an instance from just before Christmas, Trump appears at the aircraft door and slaps his right leg three times with his right hand before heading down the stairs cautiously.\n\nJust before the New Year, his old foe—steps—appeared to rankle him once more. The president cautiously climbed down the steps at the main entrance of his Mar-a-Lago estate as he welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the Gaza peace plan.\n\nTrump glanced down at the short staircase before him as he waited for Netanyahu to come forward.\n\nTrump hasn’t been coy about his fear of stairs. In September, he admitted that he was wary of publicly stumbling and falling like his predecessor Joe Biden, who was 82 when he left the White House.\n\n“Every day, the guy’s falling down stairs,” Trump told military generals who were gathered in Quantico. “I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs—like I’m on stairs, like these stairs—I walk very slowly. Nobody has to set a record. Just try not to fall because it doesn’t work out well... Just walk nice and easy. You don’t have to set any record.”",

    "description": "Small drones are \"the defining threat of our time,\" Brig. Gen. Ross said, requiring a layered defense network to stop them.",
    "fullText": "The US military is racing to develop better defenses against drones, but there's no silver bullet, no wonder weapon, that will single-handedly defeat everything, the commander of the Pentagon's new counter-drone force said.\n\nJoint Interagency Task Force 401 says stopping drones isn't about one weapon or system. The counter-drone fight will require a mix of different tools, from ways to physically shoot down drones to electronic and other non-kinetic solutions.\n\nIt also demands easier, faster processes for testing and buying systems across the services.\n\nThe task force was created last fall to expedite counter-drone technologies across the Department of Defense, replacing the Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office, which was established in 2019. Since its establishment, the task force has assessed and contributed to the US military's counter-drone arsenal, including forces at home and abroad.\n\nBut there's no one system they've found that can stop small uncrewed aerial systems, or UAS, which the task force's commander, Brig. Gen. Matt Ross, called \"the defining threat of our time.\"\n\n\"There's no silver bullet for counter-UAS. There's just not,\" Ross said last month at a media roundtable. \"If there was, we would already have it,\" he added.\n\nInstead, the task force is focused on a suite of technologies for layered, integrated protection from drones. \"Our formations must be able to detect, track, identify, and defeat these systems anywhere on the planet,\" Ross said. \"This requires us to layer our defenses by integrating sensors with kinetic and non-kinetic effectors and battle management systems into a responsive, interoperable network.\"\n\nHe said that many defense technologies already exist for countering medium-sized drones, which the Pentagon classifies as Group 3, but more work remains in smaller drones under Group 1 and 2, UAS such as the quadcopters that dominate in Ukraine.\n\nAnd the counter-drone problem isn't just about what systems are needed to protect service members and civilians. \"The technology is not going to solve this problem for us. We can't field a system that will stop every drone. It will all come down to the installation commander or the person responsible for that site and how they use the tools that we provide them,\" Ross said.\n\nIn its first 100 days, the task force has identified a key goal: creating a shared command-and-control system that makes it easier for different teams and regions to share data. It also wants to build a marketplace where the military services, law enforcement, and other agencies can find counter-drone systems suited to their specific threats, review performance data and user feedback, and potentially buy those systems in one place.\n\nThe task force notably isn't operating in isolation. There's overlap between the task force's focus on stopping Group 3 drones, systems like Shield AI's V-BAT or the Army's AAI RQ-7, and the responsibilities of the Golden Dome missile defense project, which has to include defenses for Group 3 drones.\n\nThe task force plans to share data with the Golden Dome project, and Ross said he's currently discussing what that looks like with Space Force's Gen. Michael Guetlein.\n\nAnother priority for the task force is helping protect against small drones at major events, including the FIFA World Cup this year, with matches set to be held at 11 large stadiums in cities across the US.\n\nRoss said that based on US forces overseas, \"we're heavily indexed against Group 3 systems, and those are larger systems that fly a longer distance and carry heavier payloads. And I want to make sure that we have just as robust protection against Group 1 and Group 2 systems that are smaller and much more likely to be seen over a widely attended gathering, stadium, or a watch party specifically for the World Cup.\"",

    "title": "Meet Barry Pollack, Nicolás Maduro's lawyer who also represented Julian Assange",
    "description": "Barry Pollack has a long track record of sensitive cases involving national security, and of defending corporate executives in criminal trials.",
    "fullText": "When Nicolás Maduro needed someone to represent him in an American courtroom, he turned to a lawyer with experience facing off against the federal government.\n\nThe Venezuelan political leader hired Barry Pollack, a criminal defense attorney who's represented WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange, as well as other high-profile defendants.\n\nThe Justice Department has accused Maduro, who was serving as Venezuela's president when he was captured by US forces, of participating in a narco-terrorism conspiracy, alleging he worked with illegal drug gangs. They also accused him and his wife, Cilia Flores, of conspiring to illegally import cocaine into the United States and of gun-related charges.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, US Marshals escorted the couple into a 26th-floor courtroom in lower Manhattan, where they entered not-guilty pleas and proclaimed their innocence. US military forces apprehended Maduro and Flores in a pre-dawn operation on Saturday in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas and brought them to the United States.\n\nAt the hearing, Pollack told US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein that he would file \"voluminous and complicated\" motions on Maduro's behalf, suggesting he would challenge the charges and the basis for his arrest.\n\n\"Mr. Maduro is the head of a sovereign state,\" Pollack said in court. \"He is entitled to the privileges and immunities that go with that office. In addition, there are issues about the legality of this military abduction.\"\n\nDelcy Rodriguez was sworn in as Venezuela's interim president on Monday afternoon.\n\nPollack, an attorney at the boutique law firm Harris St. Laurent & Wechsler LLP, is best known as one of the many lawyers who represented Assange, the publisher of WikiLeaks.\n\nProsecutors had accused Assange of working with hackers to obtain government secrets from federal agencies and American companies, as well as conspiring with former US Army officer Chelsea Manning to leak documents about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\nAssange pleaded guilty to espionage charges in the summer of 2024, capping a six-year legal battle that involved complex negotiations with multiple governments.\n\nPollack's experience with sensitive national security matters could be an asset for his representation of Maduro, which will likely involve classified information. The attorney has also represented Jeffrey Sterling, a former CIA officer who was convicted of espionage charges after leaking information to a journalist.\n\nTo be paid, Pollack will likely need a waiver from the US Treasury Department, which has sanctioned Maduro and the Venezuelan government.\n\nIt's not clear when Pollack began representing Maduro. He formally entered an appearance on the court docket late Monday morning. Maduro was first indicted in 2020, and Hellerstein has overseen court proceedings against other Venezuelan nationals accused of conspiring with him. Pollack didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nA court-appointed lawyer for Maduro, David Wikstrom, told Business Insider he was informed at 8:40 a.m. on Monday that he would be representing the Venezuelan president in court. Shortly before the noon court hearing, he said he still hadn't spoken to Pollack, who ultimately represented Maduro in the proceeding.\n\nFlores is represented by Mark Donnelly, a Texas-based attorney who served as a federal prosecutor for 12 years, and one of his law partners, Andres Sanchez.\n\nPollack, a former public defender and president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, has a long track record of successful defense outcomes in criminal trials.\n\nHe represented former Enron accountant Michael W. Krautz, who a jury acquitted of fraud charges. And he successfully overturned the conviction of Martin Tankleff, a Long Island man who spent 17 years in prison after he was falsely accused of killing his parents as a teenager.\n\nMore recently, Pollack represented the executive of a poultry company accused of conspiring to fix the price of chickens. Jurors declined to find the executive guilty in two separate trials.\n\nIn a 2025 interview with Lawdragon, Pollack decried the Justice Department's \"extraordinary view\" of its jurisdiction for criminal cases, using the Assange case as an example.\n\n\"You've got somebody who's not a United States citizen who is publishing information not in the United States, had not set foot in the United States, with respect to any of the alleged offensive conduct,\" Pollack said. \"The information was leaked to him by somebody in Iraq. Yet the United States obviously felt that it could pursue that as a criminal offense in the United States.\"",

    "fullText": "Children are growing up as AI natives and experts say computing skills should be on par with reading and writing\n\nIn a Cambridge classroom, Joseph, 10, trained his AI model to discern between drawings of apples and drawings of smiles.\n\n“AI gets lots of things wrong,” he said, as it mistakenly identified a fruit as a face. He set about retraining it and, in a flash, he had it back on track – instinctively understanding the inner nature of artificial intelligence and machine learning in a way few adults do.\n\nHis friends from the St Paul’s C of E primary school coding club tapped away to build their own AIs with similar dexterity. Just as people born in the early 20th century never knew a world without manned flight, and generation Z has always lived with social media, Joseph and his friends are AI natives.\n\nHere, on one December morning, some of them were being taught the principles and practicalities of the potentially world-changing technology that experts fear may pass large numbers of people by and leave them disempowered.\n\nPhilip Colligan, the chief executive of the digital education charity the Raspberry Pi Foundation, has warned of a “big split” in society between people who grasp how AIs work and are able to control them – challenging their increasing role in automating decisions in areas including housing, welfare, health, criminal justice and finance. On the other hand, there could be a cadre of AI illiterates who risk social disempowerment.\n\nColligan, a leading expert in technology and its social impacts, told the Guardian AI literacy must become a universal part of education on a par with reading and writing to avoid a social divide opening up.\n\n“There is a world where you’ve got a big split between kids who understand, have that core knowledge and therefore are able to assert themselves and those who don’t,” said Colligan, whose charity is affiliated to the £600m British low-cost tech hardware startup of the same name. “And that could be really very dangerous.”\n\nHis warning was backed by Simon Peyton Jones, a computer researcher who led the creation of the schools national curriculum for computing in 2014, prior to the AI boom. He called for a new digital literacy qualification for all schoolchildren that would ensure they know how to use AIs in a critical way.\n\n“If it’s simply a black box, then [its actions] seem like magic,” he said. “If you know nothing about how the magic is working that is terribly disabling. I am very worried about students leaving school without having agency in the world.”\n\nTheir comments came amid a fall in the number of children studying computing, with 2025 entries for a GCSE in the subject down across the UK. Today, three times more people take history and nearly double the number take biology, chemistry and physics. At the same time, use of AI systems nationwide has been surging – up 78% in the year to September, according to polling by Ipsos.\n\nPart of the belief that learning computing skills is becoming redundant comes from some of the big AI companies, which argue their systems are going to automate coding. Anthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, said in October that 90% of its own coding was automated using its Claude AI model. Meanwhile, 2025 was the year when “vibe coding” became a common phrase – capturing the idea that AIs would allow humans to build software by using natural language instructions rather than specialised code.\n\nPolitical leaders such as Keir Starmer have also suggested coding is becoming redundant. As leader of the opposition in 2023, he said: “The old way – learning out-of-date IT, on 20-year-old computers – doesn’t work. But neither does the new fashion, that every kid should be a coder, when artificial intelligence will blow that future away.” It has created the idea that understanding the inner workings of a computer may be less relevant in the future.\n\n“I think they’re just overhyping the benefits,” said Colligan, whose charity works in schools across dozens of countries.\n\n“This message is leaking out that the kids don’t need to learn this stuff any more and that is not only flawed it is dangerous. We’re already talking to teachers in lots and lots of schools around the world, not just the UK, saying: ‘We can drop computer science now, right?’ That’s a problem.”\n\nHe added: “All of us are going into a world where more and more of the decisions we encounter every day will be taken by automated systems. At the moment it’s what movie should I watch next or what song should I listen to? Fairly soon it’s going to be finance decisions, healthcare decisions, criminal justice decisions. If you don’t understand how those decisions are being made by automated systems, you can’t advocate for your rights. You can’t challenge them, you can’t critically evaluate what’s being presented to you.”\n\nIn December, the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who is now an AI investor, predicted that “we will move from staring at the internet, to living in the internet”.\n\nColligan said: “My concern is there will be a gap between kids based on their socioeconomic background. Some kids who go to great schools, who are able to teach this stuff, will be in a much stronger position as citizens, whether or not they’re using technology for their job. Those kids who are in communities where they don’t have access to [AI literacy teaching] will be passively on the end of a whole load of automated decisions.”\n\nIn the coding club, the seven- to 10-year-olds are taught how AIs work. The lessons were clearly having an effect on Joseph. He said he thought AI “will probably be good, but if lots of people believe it when it’s wrong it will have a bad impact on them”.\n\nHe was not interested in letting the AI do the coding of the video games he planned to make. “It might do it differently to what you want,” he said. “It might also do it wrong and you need to know how to solve it … I’d like to be in charge of the AI. If the AI is in charge of us, we wouldn’t really be able to control what we’re doing and that would be bad.”",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS — Nvidia (NVDA) is touting its latest robotics advancements at CES 2026 as the broader tech industry begins a large-scale effort to bring humanoid robots to life.\n\nDuring the company's keynote on Monday, CEO Jensen Huang revealed that firms ranging from Boston Dynamics and Caterpillar (CAT) to LG Electronics and NEURA Robotics are using Nvidia's robotics technologies to develop and power their various bots.\n\nNvidia has claimed that physical AI could revolutionize the $50 trillion manufacturing and logistics industries, and the company wants to be at the center of it all.\n\nDuring CES, Nvidia revealed a variety of new AI models to help train robots to interact with the world around them, as well as the hardware necessary to power their digital brains.\n\nIn addition to humanoid bots, Nvidia showed off a new family of models for self-driving cars called Alpamayo. According to the company, Alpamayo uses a chain-of-thought reasoning-based vision language action (VLA) model.\n\nThat's a lot to take in, but essentially the models can recognize unique driving situations that might not otherwise happen during a regular drive and come up with the proper way to move forward.\n\nFor instance, the model could see that a traffic light is out when a vehicle is approaching an intersection, recognize the problem, and try to figure out what to do next.\n\nNvidia said the models are meant to serve as \"large-scale teacher models that developers can fine-tune and distill into the backbones of their complete [self-driving] stacks.\"\n\nIn other words, Alpamayo is meant to help developers improve their self-driving vehicle technologies over time.\n\nNvidia said companies including Lucid (LCID), Uber (UBER), and Berkeley DeepDrive have shown interest in Alpamayo.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles are hitting roads around the world, with Google's Waymo leading the way, but they're still not perfect. Some cars have caused traffic jams and have gotten confused in certain situations.\n\nNvidia sees virtual training as a helpful solution for the continued development of the technology, allowing developers to teach their AI models without having to necessarily put cars on the road at all times.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

    "title": "There’s Compelling Evidence That Someone Connected to the Trump Administration Profited Off the Invasion of Venezuela by Placing Large Bets on Polymarket",
    "description": "\"Pete Hegseth making some beer money on the side?\"",
    "fullText": "Prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi have long garnered a reputation for facilitating cheating and insider trading — allowing an athlete, for instance, to place a bet on a game they could then lose on purpose.\n\nNow there’s compelling evidence that someone with inside information about the Trump administration’s regime change plans in Venezuela used that foreknowledge to profit massively from the conflict.\n\nAs spotted by researcher Tyson Brody, an unidentified user bet tens of thousands of dollars on various predictions that Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro would be imminently “out” or that the US forces would show up “in Venezuela by” a specified date during the runup to the incursion.\n\nThe account “existed for only one week and quickly became the biggest ‘yes’ holder in the Maduro out market,” Brody tweeted.\n\nThe evidence of insider trading is compelling, to say the least, given the highly suspicious timing. The account invested over $30,000 less than two days before the United States launched its invasion to kidnap Maduro and his wife and “profited $400,000 in less than 24 hours,” as sports entrepreneur Joe Pompliano calculated in a post on Bluesky.\n\n“Seems pretty suspicious!” he added. “[Secretary of defense] Pete Hegseth making some beer money on the side?” Brody joked.\n\n“Insider trading is not only allowed on prediction markets; it’s encouraged,” Pompliano argued.\n\nWho was behind the Polymarket account remains a mystery. Accounts on markets like Polymarket are anonymous, and payouts are in cryptocurrency, making them hard to track.\n\nAs Semafor reported over the weekend, news organizations also had early intel of the US raid on Venezuela, but held off publishing the information so as not to put US troops in danger.\n\nIn other words, could it have been an insider at a New York or Washington newsroom who was trying to make a buck — or was it an operative inside the Trump administration?\n\nPrediction markets have long raised concerns over exactly these types of situations. Case in point, one Polymarket user made $1 million in 24 hours in early December after betting on Google’s 2025 Year in Search rankings. Per Forbes, the account had a “near-perfect record of 22 correct predictions out of 23 attempts.”\n\nAs The American Prospect points out, critics of the Trump administration have long accused officials of dabbling in similar behavior. The administration has also allowed the prediction market to flourish by dropping enforcement cases in the crypto world and failing to introduce meaningful regulations.\n\nEven Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), which owns the president’s social network, Truth Social, entered the prediction markets business last year, showing a pointed appetite for the space.\n\n“Of course insiders shouldn’t be able to get rich off of policy decisions — but even more concerning is the possibility that people are skewing policy outcomes in order to make their bets pay off,” Demand Progress executive director Sean Vitka told The American Prospect.\n\nOne thing’s for sure: while insiders profit, those without that privileged information lose out — and when the bets are on a deadly conflict, innocent people stand to suffer as well.\n\n“And questions related to whether or not, and when, military action might be undertaken are especially vulnerable to such manipulation because the president frequently moves with discretion over the timing and (legally or not) without notice to the public or Congress,” Vitka added.\n\nMore on Polymarket: New App Lets Users Bet on Deadly Conflicts in Real Time",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump is fretting that the Supreme Court will shoot down his signature tariffs initiative and declare it illegal.\n\nIn a panicked Truth Social post, the 79-year-old pushed the false claim that his tariffs generated $600 billion for the U.S. while suggesting there is a media blackout on their dubious benefits.\n\n“We have taken in, and will soon be receiving, more than 600 Billion Dollars in Tariffs, but the Fake News Media refuses to talk about it because they hate and disrespect our Country, and want to interfere with the upcoming Tariff decision, one of the most important ever, of the United States Supreme Court,” Trump wrote. “Because of Tariffs, our Country is financially, AND FROM A NATIONAL SECURITY STANDPOINT, FAR STRONGER AND MORE RESPECTED THAN EVER BEFORE. GOD BLESS AMERICA!”\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule in the coming weeks on whether to overturn a previous ruling that declared most of Trump’s sweeping global tariffs illegal.\n\nA lower federal appeals court found in August that the president had overstepped his authority when he cited a 1977 law—the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which is designed to address threats during a national emergency—to justify his reciprocal tariffs.\n\nWhile the conservative-majority Supreme Court, including three justices nominated by Trump, has largely ruled in the president’s favor in past cases, there are growing indications that the court may not back him this time and could strike down the tariffs.\n\nDuring a hearing in November, Trump-appointed Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, as well as Chief Justice John Roberts, appeared skeptical of the president’s reasoning for imposing the tariffs.\n\nIf SCOTUS were to rule against Trump, it would not only be a major embarrassment for the president but could also trigger further economic turmoil, as countries may need to be reimbursed for the billions of dollars of funds collected under Trump’s tariff plans.\n\nTrump has posted multiple fear-mongering messages on Truth Social since the Supreme Court began hearing arguments in the case last year.\n\n“The U.S. Supreme Court was given the wrong numbers. The ‘unwind’ in the event of a negative decision on Tariffs would be, including investments made, to be made, and return of funds, in excess of 3 Trillion Dollars,” Trump wrote in a late-night November post. “It would not be possible to ever make up for that kind of a ‘drubbing.’”\n\nIn another desperate message on January 2, Trump added: “Tariffs are an overwhelming benefit to our Nation, as they have been incredible for our National Security and Prosperity (like nobody has ever seen before!). Losing our ability to Tariff other countries who treat us unfairly would be a terrible blow to the United States of America.”",

    "description": "Christine Sauvé, 55, and husband Alain Noël, 56, were found dead by their son in their Dominican Republic vacation home on the morning of Dec. 26",
    "fullText": "The bodies of Alain Noël, 56, and Christine Sauvé, 55, of Québec, were found by their son at the couple’s vacation home in the Dominican Republic on Dec. 26\n\nHer brother tells PEOPLE that the couple hadn't been feeling well before their deaths and seemed \"exhausted\" when they last spoke the following day\n\nA married couple from Canada were found dead while vacationing in the Dominican Republic last month. As family members await answers about what happened, they're speaking out about the couple's final moments.\n\nChristine Sauvé, 55, and Alain Noël, 56, both of Québec, were found dead by their son in their vacation home located in the El Indio Village residential complex in Villa Riva on Friday, Dec. 26, her brother, Gilles Sauvé Jr., confirms to PEOPLE.\n\nAutopsies have already been performed and Gilles says the family's been told they can expect initial results later this week, but that a final report could take up to 4 months.\n\nWithout any definitive answers just yet, there's been lots of speculation in the local press, including questions about whether the couple were murdered or died by suicide. But, Gilles believes \"that is not true.\"\n\nChristine and Alain were married for over 30 years and raised two kids — Jonathan, 30, and Sabrina, 28 — Gilles says, describing the couple as good people with lots of friends.\n\n\"Alain was a big man but a really big teddy bear. And Christine was amazing,\" her brother says. \"She liked to do a lot of things for the family.”\n\nChristine and Alain arrived in the Dominican Republic — where they got a house they planned to live in after retiring — along with their son Jonathan on Dec. 14 for the start of a month-long vacation.\n\nWhile overseas, Gilles says that Christine began experiencing dizziness and had a fall, which prompted her to go to a hospital on Dec. 25, where she had her blood work done. When she went home later that day, she was not given any prescription for her symptoms, but was told to come back the following day for some scans.\n\nGilles says that Alain had also experienced a little dizziness, but was so caught up in worry about his wife's health that he didn't end up mentioning it to doctors.\n\nAfter coming back from the hospital, the couple FaceTimed their family back in Canada. Gilles says they both appeared to be a \"little bit exhausted,\" but didn't report feeling dizzy at the time.\n\nDuring the conversation, Christine mentioned having no clue what caused the dizziness. She wondered if it might have anything to do with her ongoing health issues — they both had high blood pressure and diabetes — although she couldn't say for sure.\n\n\"It was not clear,\" Gilles says. \"There was nothing really clear about it.\"\n\nAdditionally, they both mentioned having a bit of a \"stomach problem,\" but didn't think they'd eaten any food that upset them.\n\nMostly, they were \"very tired and exhausted,\" but otherwise fine during the call, according to Gilles.\n\n\"Alain showed me his house outside because he did some new little garden things and put lights on and,\" he says, adding that his sister was also \"looking and talking\" well.\n\nThe next morning, when Jonathan woke up around 9:30 a.m., he noticed his parents hadn’t gotten up yet, which was odd because Alain, who worked in the family construction business, was usually an early riser.\n\nGilles says Jonathan brushed it off at the time, thinking they'd slept in because they'd been so tired the night before. However, when they still hadn't woken up an hour later, he went into their room and found them unresponsive in bed.\n\nThe first thing that Jonathan did, says Gilles, was call his sister Sabrina and tell her that their parents were not breathing. Sabrina then told her brother to call the resort manager-owner, who proceeded to contact local authorities.\n\n“Everybody came and they did what they had to do and they searched the house,” Gilles says.\n\nGilles and Sabrina arrived in the Dominican Republic about a day and a half later to be with Jonathan and help communicate with Dominican authorities, which have been difficult due to the language barrier.\n\nCanadian officials reached out to the family four days later to give them the phone number of the funeral home, which they'd already reached out to.\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada previously confirmed their deaths to Global News, saying they were in contact with local authorities \"to gather more information\" amid the ongoing investigation, but were not able to release any further information due to privacy considerations.\n\nNeither the Dominican National Police, the National Institute of Forensic Sciences, the Attorney General’s Office in the Dominican Republic nor Global Affairs Canada responded to PEOPLE's request for additional comment.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nMore than a week after the tragedy, Gilles says the family is doing okay, but the deaths of their loved ones have been hard to process.\n\n“It's a big loss,\" he says, noting that losing them both at the same time has made everything harder, especially for their kids.\n\nAs for how he wants Alain and Christine to be remembered, her brother says it's for their legacy of kindness.\n\nSharing an example, Gilles says that when his wife died a year and a half ago from leukemia, his sister stepped up to help take care of his daughter, who also works in the family business. Now, in the wake of his sister's death, he says he'll do whatever he can to be there for her kids.\n\nGilles adds, \"I have two kids, but now I have four kids because I will take care of theirs.”",

    "description": "Scott Bessent called it “a historic victory in preserving U.S. sovereignty and protecting American workers and businesses from extraterritorial overreach.\"",
    "fullText": "U.S. multinational corporations will be exempted from paying more corporate taxes overseas in a deal finalized by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nThe OECD announced Monday that nearly 150 countries have agreed on the plan, initially crafted in 2021, to stop large global companies from shifting profits to low-tax countries, no matter where they operate in the world.\n\nThe amended version excludes large U.S.-based multinational corporations from the 15% global minimum tax after negotiations between President Donald Trump’s administration and other members of the Group of Seven wealthy nations.\n\nOECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann said in a statement that the agreement is a “landmark decision in international tax co-operation” and “enhances tax certainty, reduces complexity, and protects tax bases.”\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called the agreement “a historic victory in preserving U.S. sovereignty and protecting American workers and businesses from extraterritorial overreach.”\n\nThe most recent version of the deal waters down a landmark 2021 agreement that set a minimum global corporate tax of 15%. The idea was to stop multinational corporations, including Apple and Nike, from using accounting and legal maneuvers to shift earnings to low- or no-tax havens.\n\nThose havens are typically places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, where the companies actually do little or no business.\n\nFormer Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was a key driver of the 2021 OECD global tax deal and made the corporate minimum tax one of her top priorities. The plan was widely panned by congressional Republicans who said it would make the U.S. less competitive in a global economy.\n\nThe Trump administration in June re-negotiated the deal when congressional Republicans rolled back a so-called revenge tax provision from Trump’s big tax and spending bill that would have allowed the federal government to impose taxes on companies with foreign owners, as well as on investors from countries judged as charging “unfair foreign taxes” on U.S. companies.\n\nTax transparency groups have criticized the amended OECD plan.\n\n“This deal risks nearly a decade of global progress on corporate taxation only to allow the largest, most profitable American companies to keep parking profits in tax havens,” said Zorka Milin, policy director at the FACT Coalition, a tax transparency nonprofit.\n\nTax watchdogs argue the minimum tax is supposed to halt an international race to the bottom for corporate taxation that has led multinational businesses to book their profits in countries with low tax rates.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Hisense Just Announced the RGB MiniLED Evo",
    "description": "The company also revealed that Xbox Cloud Gaming is coming to its TVs.",
    "fullText": "Hisense is all about TVs at this year's CES—specifically, how those TVs display color. If the company's keynote is any indication, Hisense is extremely invested in leading the charge in color reproduction. Though its tagline this year is \"Innovating a Brighter Life,\" the pitch is less on how bright their TVs are, and more on how true to life their colors are, especially when it comes to accurately displaying the filmmakers' original intent. Will consumers buy a TV because their favorite movie looks a bit more how the director intended it to be? I'm not sure. But that's largely the idea behind Hisense's new RGB MiniLED Evo.\n\nHisense's biggest announcement of the day is its RGB MiniLED Evo. This iteration of the company's RGB MiniLED technology comes with three key upgrades: First, there's the \"Chromagic\" precision backlight. The company says this technology helps avoid color bleeding and tint shifting when watching content. It also boosts the colors offered by existing RGB MiniLED technology: Hisense says this new standard can display 110% of the BT.2020 color gamut with four-primary colors (red, green, blue, and sky blue, or cyan), while RGB MiniLED can achieve 100% BT.2020 with the standard three primary colors. The company says Evo also comes with AI-powered RGB color dimming with \"134 bit precision.\"\n\nSecond, RGB MiniLED Evo has a \"Hi-View AI engine,\" to sync color across the TV's backlight. This engine comes with a three-core RISC CPU and a 2TOPS NPU for AI processing. Hisense claims the chip provides a 40% boost in computing performance, a 70% improvement in scenario recognition computing power, and 100% upgrade in scenario adaption computing capability. The company says the RGB MiniLED Evo can help display shows and movies as the original creators intended them to look. Hisense compared it to OLED, which it says displays content with too little brightness, and QD MiniLED, which it says compromises the color by being too bright.\n\nHisense's RGB MiniLED—not necessarily just Evo—also supposedly cuts down on blue light. Hisense says its new display tech emits 60% \"less harmful\" blue light than QD OLED, though the science doesn't necessarily support the claims that blue light is any worse for you than other light colors. The company also says RGB MiniLED is 30% more energy-efficient than QD OLED, though it didn't include any references to back up those claims in the keynote. Finally, Evo comes with an AI calibration feature, which Hisense touts as a way for users to turn their TVs into professional reference monitors.\n\nThe company says RGB MiniLED evo is coming to its product lineup, including the U8, UX, U9, and U7 series, this year.\n\nWhile the RGB MiniLED Evo was undoubtedly Hisense's biggest announcement this year, the company also ran through some other news at the keynote. First, there's the XR10, a new projector that can reach up to 300 inches. It comes with liquid cooling, lens shift supporting a 4K projection, and 6,000 lumens of brightness.\n\nThe company also announced the MXS MicroLED TV, which can scale up to 163 inches. Despite devoting only a moment to the TV, company says the MXS won an CES 2026 Innovation Award. Hisense also made some announcements about its TV OS, including features like weather, calendar, and integrations with other smart home devices. But perhaps most notably, Hisense announced a partnership with Microsoft to bring both Copilot and Xbox Cloud Gaming to its TVs. That's pretty big news.\n\nFinally, if you're both a Hisense and a FIFA fan, you can buy products from the \"Hisense Elite Collection,\" which are designed specifically for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. I'm not sure how big that crossover is, nor do I think I'd buy a TV because it was made for one soccer event, but it was part of Hisense's announcement.",

If you let someone else use your device—whether you're showing a friend a collection of photos or allowing a stranger to make an emergency call—there's a lot you don't want them to be able to see.\n\nIf you're an iPhone user, there are several features you can enable to prevent others from snooping around your device.\n\nIf you don't want someone using your device to see anything else on it, you can turn on Guided Access, which limits them to a single app (such as Phone or Photos). This essentially locks down your screen and prevents navigation outside of the specific features you make available.\n\nFirst, go to Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access and toggle the feature on. Tap Passcode Settings to set up a specific passcode or flip the Face ID toggle to use biometrics to end Guided Access sessions.\n\nTo start a Guided Access session before handing over your phone, open the app and triple click the side button. You can circle specific areas of the screen you don't want to respond to touch (such as swipes through Photos). Tap Session Settings at the bottom to set a time limit, disable the keyboard, and manage button press options. Then tap Start.\n\nTo end a Guided Access session, triple-click the side button and enter your passcode or double-click and authenticate with Face ID.\n\nSome mobile apps, like financial apps and password managers, already require you to log in or authenticate with your username and password combo or device biometrics every time you open them.

    "fullText": "A father suffered serious head injuries during a brawl that broke out in the queue for a popular ride at Disneyland over the winter break.\n\nThe fight occurred last Tuesday afternoon in line for the Indiana Jones Adventure, one of the marquee dark rides at the Anaheim theme park, police and Disneyland officials confirmed.\n\n“A group of people were waiting in line at Indiana Jones when another group cut through the line to catch up with other family members,” Anaheim Police Sgt. Matt Sutter told KTLA.\n\nThe confrontation escalated into a roughly 30-second fight between two men, shocking parkgoers, including many children. Witnesses said the man whose family cut into the line brutally beat the other, who was visiting the park from Washington state with his family.\n\n“There were several people intervening to stop the guy,” wrote Reddit user ImaginaryBag. “He managed to get some hits in even with people blocking. Then he stepped back a bit so others did too. That’s when he jumped in for one last sucker punch, which drew blood, and then he ran off with his family following.”\n\nPolice confirmed the suspect fled Disneyland and remained at large as of Monday morning. Sutter said investigators have strong leads on his identity and believe he is a Southern California resident.\n\n“There are two sides to every story, so we need to hear from him (and) what happened from his point of view,” Sutter told KTLA’s Sara Welch.\n\nThe victim, whose name was not released, was treated by Disneyland’s first aid staff for injuries including a large gash on his face that required stitches.\n\n“He refused to hit back (which took a lot of discipline) because he didn’t want the rest of the family to get kicked out or us blacklisted,” wrote Reddit user Wittwitbarista, who said the victim is her husband.\n\nDespite the ordeal, the family stayed at the park for the rest of the day.\n\n“Hubby had no concussion, stitches, okay honestly … Disney Security, nurses and (cast members) were all so magically wonderful,” Wittwitbarista wrote.\n\nThis was the second incident that same day involving an Indiana Jones attraction at a Disney park. A 400-pound inflatable boulder prop rolled off its track during the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular at Disney’s Hollywood Studios, injuring a park employee who stepped in front of it to keep it from bouncing into the crowd.",

    "fullText": "Jan 5 (Reuters) - Intel launched Panther Lake, its new AI chip for laptops, on Monday at the CES trade show in Las Vegas, as the company seeks to ​reassure investors about the first product made using its next-generation manufacturing process called 18A.\n\nJim Johnson, ‌senior vice president and general manager of Intel's PC group, offered technical details about the company's first line of Panther Lake chips known ‌as Intel Core Ultra Series 3. The chips feature a new transistor design and a way to deliver power to the chip due to the company's 18A manufacturing process.\n\nAt the event, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company made good on its promise to ship its first products with the 18A manufacturing process in 2025, referring to ⁠the Panther Lake chips.\n\nIntel's prior-generation Lunar ‌Lake chips were largely made by TSMC. The stakes for Intel are high - the company is making its first high-volume product with 18A, and hopes to reclaim market share ‍it has lost to Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nJohnson said the company has created a separate graphics chiplet - a mini chip stitched together with other mini-chips to form a complete processor. On Monday, Intel said the Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips ​would deliver 60% better performance than the prior-generation Lunar Lake Series 2.\n\nIntel plans to launch a platform ‌for handheld video games based on the Panther Lake designs this year, Johnson said. Handheld PCs designed by a range of suppliers have grown in popularity in recent years.\n\nIntel has struggled with the yield, or the number of good chips per silicon wafer, for the Panther Lake processors, Reuters reported last year. Intel executives have said its yields are improving monthly and will pave the way for the launch this year.\n\nFor its part, ⁠AMD plans to give a CES keynote address at 9:30 p.m. ​EST on Monday  (0230 GMT on Tuesday). CEO Lisa Su will ​likely launch new generations of PC chips that are geared for AI and graphics.\n\nAMD announced a multibillion-dollar deal with OpenAI for its next-generation MI400 chips, some of which the companies ‍plan to deploy this year. ⁠The deal with the ChatGPT maker is expected to generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue for the chip designer.\n\nThe CEO of AI chip leader Nvidia, Jensen Huang, also spoke at CES ⁠on Monday. He said the company’s next generation of chips was in “full production,” and they could deliver five times the artificial-intelligence computing ‌of the company’s previous chips when serving up chatbots and other AI apps.",

    "title": "CES 2026: Petkit's Yumshare Daily Feast Is an Automatic Wet Food Feeder for Your Cat",
    "description": "The Yumshare can automatically dispense wet food for up to one week.",
    "fullText": "I don't have a cat, but I do have a dog, and my dog can be a picky eater. After months of trial and error, the only way we could get him to consistently eat breakfast and dinner was with wet food. There is no scenario in which I or someone watching my dog can outsource the task of feeding him, but that's not the case for cat owners. I know that cats sometimes stay home alone for extended periods of time, where an automatic food dispenser becomes essential. I can only imagine, then, that cat owners who, like me, feed their pet wet food, now have a challenge: Someone has to be there to feed the cat.\n\nThat's what intrigues me about Petkit's Yumshare Daily Feast, an automated cat feeder that specifically works with wet food. I covered the Yumshare briefly when Petkit first announced it last week, but I got some hands-on time with the product today on the CES show floor. And while the device I saw isn't going to market just yet, I was intrigued.\n\nThe concept itself is pretty simple, but a bit more complex in execution. As you might expect, the feeder distributes portions of food for your cat to eat when you're not available—only here, that food is wet, not dry. To achieve this, Petkit outfitted the Yumshare with a chamber that can hold up to seven pouches of wet food at once. These pouches are designed for the Yumshare alone: Right now, the only company making pouches is Food Chain, which uses Petkit's proprietary design to fit the Yumshare, but it's possible more companies more jump on board in the future.\n\nWhen the Yumshare first opens one of these pouches, it sets a timer: After 48 hours, the pouch is discarded. In the meantime, the machine can automatically dole out portions set by the user, into a cup, which is stored in a separate chamber in the device. Once the portion is distributed, the pouch is sealed until the next portion is needed. The machine also uses UVC ultraviolet light to sanitize the package, with the goal of eliminating bacteria.\n\nThe automation extends to the portion of wet food itself, as well. Whether your cat eats all of the food, some of the food, or none of the food, the Yumshare can discard what's left when it detects it's time to do so. That might be the AI camera identifying that the food has dried up, or an internal clock recognizing that too much time has passed for the food to be safe to eat. Either way, the food drops into a waste compartment, which can hold up to 15 cups at once. The stand remains empty until it's time to hand out another portion of food.\n\nHow large or small each portion is, as well as how often portions are distributed, is up to you. Petkit showed me a mockup of the Yumshare's app, which lets you customize this feeding schedule. The app will also tell you how many portions have been distributed, and how many are left in the chamber. You can also take a look at a live video feed of your cat, via the 4K camera embedded in the device, or view a clip history of your cat's feeding habits.\n\nMy only question is the lack of refrigeration: Petkit says that there is no need for it, since the pouches are all sealed until use, closed in between portions, and the chamber uses ultraviolet light to sterilize for bacteria. But I'd want to confirm there are no health risks to keeping an opened pouch unrefrigerated for up to two full days, even with that UVC light. Assuming that's true, I'm quite impressed with this prototype. If I were a cat owner that frequently needed to leave my pet alone at breakfast and dinner, this is something I'd have my eye on.",

    "description": "The ROG Zephyrus Duo is back for 2026, with two full-sized screens.",
    "fullText": "CES is the time of year for weird computers, and Asus is bringing back an old fan favorite to help fill its unusual form factor quota. Gamers who miss the days of dual screens, get excited: the ROG Zephyrus Duo is returning for 2026, and it's bigger than ever.\n\nLooking a bit like a gigantic Nintendo DS, the new ROG Zephyrus Duo stacks two full-sized 3K OLED screens on top of each other, with a standard laptop hinge in between. It's a lot like the company's existing Zenbook Duo, but that one's geared more for productivity users—the Zephyrus Duo is fully specced out for gamers, with a 120Hz refresh rate on both screens, the latest Intel Core Ultra chips, up to an RTX 5090 laptop GPU, up to 64GB of RAM, and up to 2TB of storage. Plus, it supports 250W fast charging and can play games using up to 125W of power.\n\nThat's plenty for even the most demanding games, although its price is still an unknown for now. What we do know is how different this is from the last Zephyrus Duo, which came out in 2023. That laptop's lower screen was a simple small angled panel above the keyboard, instead of a full-sized display matching the upper one. It was great for displaying stats at a glance while playing, but not much else.\n\nInstead, the new Zephyrus Duo can display the same game across both screens, mirror them, or pull up reference material on one screen while you play on the other. It's also got a bunch of new ways you can use it: It comes with a detachable wireless keyboard, and you can either use it like a normal laptop with that keyboard covering one of the screens, or get creative.\n\nAn example photo from Asus show the laptop with one screen above the other, both screens in a side-to-side portrait mode, the whole laptop laid flat on a table (perhaps for head-to-head play), and tent mode. Tent mode is especially interesting—an Asus representative told journalists that gamers could play the same game against each other while sitting across from each other in tent mode, with each display acting as a private screen. He did acknowledge that this might impact performance and compatibility might differ based on game, but I could see it being an especially great option for, say, fighting games.\n\nAgain, this format has been used for non-gaming laptops before, but it's seemingly got a lot of potential for gamers, too. There's a reason one of Nintendo's most popular handhelds opted for a dual-screen setup. And hey, maybe you could even play some DS games made on this, too.\n\nThe new ROG Zephyrus Duo is expected to launch sometime in Q2 of this year.",

    "description": "Help me, ROG. You're my only hope.",
    "fullText": "With the rise of streaming culture, a lot of gamers have started investing in computers that don't just play games well, but that look good while doing it. Asus's newest pre-built gaming desktop, the ROG G1000, is pretty by-the-book when it comes to high-end performance, but it's got one major selling point when it comes to those all-important gamer aesthetics: holograms.\n\nBuilt into this computer's front panel and one of its side panels, safely tucked into inaccessible glass windows, are rapidly rotating LED strips that, when in motion, create convincing full-color images that appear to have depth. The \"frame rate\" can be a little low, but it's a known technology that's all over the show floor at every CES now, and you can actually buy generic standalone hologram fans on Amazon for around $60-$100. It's just rare to see it integrated into something like a PC.\n\nThis hologram tech, called AniMe Holo, should make for a great way to show off on camera (or to your buddies in a college dorm) and Asus is promising some pretty expansive customizability. You can put still images and gifs on it, sure, but Asus also told journalists it can support full videos or mp4 files, without any limit on length. I think I'd try to use it to watch Shrek.\n\nThe effect comes across a bit better in-person, but it's still unusual enough to look enticing over video, even if you lose some of the depth. Unfortunately, still photos aren't really a great way to show this thing off, since they can't depict the rotating motion.\n\nAesthetics aside, the G1000 is also at the top of the power game, coming with the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X 3D CPU, an RTX 5090 GPU, up to 128GB of RAM, and a 2TB storage. It's got bite to back up its bark, and will be able to play the latest games at max settings with no issue.\n\nOf course, specs like that are likely to cost you a pretty penny, especially with the hologram gimmick tossed on top of them. Asus hasn't tipped its hand on pricing yet, but the ROG G1000 is expected to launch sometime in Q2 of this year.",

The day started with speedruns of games like Final Fantasy X, Mega Man Battle Network, Nuclear Throne, and Wolfenstein: The Old Blood. As the multi-hour livestream went on, the event's organizers booted up Pac-Man World 2 for Minecraft content creator DThaiPome to play.",

    "description": "Resident Evil 4 Remake's opening moments could have played out much differently if Capcom had not opted to cut an opening referred to as \"Chapter 0,\" in which players would have controlled Ashley and witnessed her kidnapping at the hands of the Los Illuminados. At least, that's according to datamined files spotted by an eagle-eyed fan.\nUsing leftover pieces from \"Chapter 0\" found in the game's files, YouTuber Thekempy has pieced together what the game's lost opening might have looked like in a recent video. Players would have controlled Ashley alone in a forest at night as she encountered a Los Illuminados ritual, something which can actually be briefly seen in a story trailer for the game released in October 2022.",

According to a post they made early on January 5, Nvidia seems poised to bring back the RTX 3060 in the first quarter of 2026.\nContinue Reading at GameSpot",

For example, the Machinapieds enemy is simply \"Machine with feet\" in French, while the Licorne enemy is French for unicorn.

Lorwyn Eclipsed will see the MTG community return to the dual planes of Lorwyn and Shadowmoor, which were previously separated by light and darkness, but have now intertwined to create new and exciting creatures and spells. Wizards of the Coast has begun to reveal cards from the upcoming set, with many shown off during a livestream today.\n\nThe first reveal of Lorwyn Eclipsed featured faces new and old from the Magic universe, including first-year Strixhaven student Abigale, and the mischievous elven sorcerer Oko. Multiple cards, mechanics, and treatments were shown off during the livestream, including the return of Anime Showcase treatments, as well as a mini bonus sheet of Special Guest reprints from Magic's past.\n\nThe reveal came coupled with a brief music video, One Light, One Dark: A Boggart Ballad. The short story featured two boggarts, one living in Lorwyn and the other in Shadowmoor, and both were represented by puppets created in partnership between Wizards of the Coast and the Jim Henson company.\n\nWe'll be updating this gallery with more cards from Lorwyn Eclipsed as they are revealed throughout the week, with the final previews slated for January 9. Lorwyn Eclipsed, meanwhile, is set to launch on January 23 in both local game stores and big box retailers, with pre-release events scheduled to begin one week earlier on January 16.",

    "fullText": "On days like this, when a manager falls, the immediate reaction is to think about where it all went wrong, the timeline of doom, the moments where the writing started appearing on the wall.\n\nWith Wilfried Nancy, there's no need for any of that because it was never right in the first place. There were no turning points in this saga, no twists in the plot.\n\nNancy's appointment was one of the greatest blunders Celtic have made in their history. A relative rookie on a bad run with Columbus Crew - they finished seventh in Major League Soccer - it was a punt based on little more than the hipster vibes of Paul Tisdale, the now former head of football operations.\n\nTisdale didn't open his mouth to fans or media in his brief time in a powerful position at Celtic Park, but he did a whole lot of damage. If Nancy ranks extremely highly in the club's most calamitous calls then Tisdale is on a par or, perhaps even, slightly ahead of him given that it was the self-styled 'Doctor Football' who championed Nancy to the club's board.\n\nNancy never got out of the blocks, his two wins from eight games coming in a flawed victory over bottom-of-the-table Livingston and a triumph over 10-man Aberdeen, who have also just sacked their manager.\n\nAll memory of Nancy's reign - if you want to call it that - will be shovelled under a carpet now by anybody and everybody culpable in the process of appointing him. If they're all true to recent form, none of them will speak, none will apologise, none will show humility by accepting that they got this woefully wrong.\n\nThe fans will have to make-do with a short written statement. Let them eat cake, in other words.\n\nNancy's laidback arrival - spending just 15 minutes talking with Martin O'Neill before ripping up everything O'Neill had done to stabilise things - was in stark contrast to the unceremonious manner of his exit. O'Neill, as interim, was there longer than Nancy.",

    "fullText": "Gary Neville has urged Manchester United to \"stop experimenting\" and appoint a manager who \"fits the club's DNA\" after Ruben Amorim was sacked on Monday.\n\nFormer midfielder Darren Fletcher has taken charge until a caretaker is appointed, with the club only planning to name a permanent manager in the summer.\n\nAnd former England and United full-back Neville believes the next managerial appointment at Old Trafford must reflect the traditions of the club.\n\n\"The experiments have got to stop,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\n\"I've always been very proud of what this club is - adventurous, exciting football, playing young players and entertaining the crowd. They must take risks and have the courage to play attacking, aggressive football.\n\n\"United have got to a point where they need a manager who fits the DNA of the football club.\n\n\"Barcelona will never change for anybody. I don't believe United should change for anybody. The club has to find a manager who has got experience and who's willing to play fast entertaining, attacking and aggressive football.\"\n\nAmorim arrived at United with a clear tactical vision, favouring the 3-4-3 formation that had brought him success at Sporting, but United struggled to adapt.\n\n\"I thought they'd adapt better to the back three than they did,\" Neville said. \"I'm really stunned that they've continued to play so poorly in that system.\"\n\nSpeaking on The Rest Is Football podcast, former England striker Gary Lineker said: \"I think it was almost as though [Amorim] provoked it.\n\n\"It didn't seem to be the right fit and he was a bit stubborn about the way he wanted to play. The players didn't suit the way he plays and the club should have recognised that.\"",

He is a fine man and I am sure he will go on and achieve success again, I have no doubt of that.\n\n\"For me, I've been asked to take this great job on again and my focus will be to try and get us back to winning ways if we can. We will need everyone right behind us.\"\n\nO'Neill, who won seven trophies with Celtic from 2000-05, will again be assisted by Shaun Maloney, Mark Fotheringham and Stephen McManus.\n\nCeltic, champions in 13 of the past 14 seasons, currently sit second in the Scottish Premiership, six points behind Hearts and ahead of Rangers on goals scored.\n\nUnder Nancy, they were beaten in the League Cup final by St Mirren, with O'Neill having overseen the semi-final win over Rangers.\n\n\"We still have a lot to look forward to and a lot to try and achieve, and myself, Shaun and the coaching staff and, of course, the players will be giving everything to achieve all the success we can for the club,\" added O'Neill.",
