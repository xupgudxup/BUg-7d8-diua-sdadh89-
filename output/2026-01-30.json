    "fullText": "A lawsuit filed against the Red Sox alleges the team jacked up ticket prices illegally.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in Massachusetts federal court earlier this month and claims the Sox advertised false prices for tickets to baseball games and other events at Fenway.\n\nThe lawsuit says fans would see one price but then pay another after junk fees were added, which could more than double the ticket price in some instances.\n\n“The Red Sox’s false advertising centers on their use of drip pricing and junk fees. Specifically, the Red Sox would advertise illusorily low prices for their tickets,” the lawsuit filed against the Fenway Sports Group states. “When purchasers attempted to buy those tickets, however, the Red Sox would add mandatory fees at the last minute, such as “Per-Ticket Fees” and “Order Fees,” that could increase the cost of a purchase by as much as 150%.\"\n\n“In other words, the Red Sox’s advertised tickets were not actually available for purchase at the advertised prices,” the suit continues. “The Red Sox’s use of drip pricing and junk fees was both unfair and deceptive. It was also illegal under the consumer protection laws of Massachusetts and other states.”\n\nWhen Boston 25 News reached out for a comment, a Red Sox spokesperson told us they do not comment on pending litigation but that they’ve always complied with the law.\n\nDownload the FREE Boston 25 News app for breaking news alerts.\n\nFollow Boston 25 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch Boston 25 News NOW",

That is the sort of production Denver needs.\n\nYes, it will be pricey, but Pickens proved that the character narratives surrounding him, for the most part, weren't a thing at all in Dallas.\n\nHe's earned his big contract, and if it sees him land with the Broncos, Nix will be one happy quarterback.\n\nESPN hints at major reason Todd Monken moved on from Ravens\n\nKeon Coleman the big winner from Bills press conference\n\nRavens' Jesse Minter offers perfect quote on Lamar Jackson\n\nAnalyst sees potential trade for Eagles' $29 million weapon\n\nBills urged to sign All-Pro weapon for Josh Allen\n\nBills' Joe Brady solves Keon Coleman's future with 1 sentence",

    "fullText": "Michigan State football is reportedly \"regaining the momentum\" in their pursuits for a big-time prospect in the 2026 class.\n\nRivals recruiting insider Greg Smith reported on Thursday that Michigan State is \"regaining the momentum\" in a key recruiting battle with Penn State for four-star wide receiver Samson Gash. National signing day is right around the corner, and it appears that it'll come down to the Spartans or Nittany Lions for Gash's commitment.\n\nGash is a four-star wide receiver, with a recruiting rating of 90.80 in 247Sports' composite system. He ranks as the No. 47 wide receiver and No. 6 player from Michigan in the 2026 class. He is also listed as the No. 289 overall prospect in the class.\n\nGash has been verbally committed to Michigan State since the summer, but elected to not sign with the Spartans during the early signing period due to the recent coaching change. However, he has never fully opened up his recruitment and it appears Michigan State may still be in the drivers seat to add this elite-level wide receiver.\n\nClick on the post below to read more from Smith on the latest in Gash's recruitment:\n\nOne team is regaining the momentum for 4-star WR Samson Gash as his final decision nears, via @GregSmithRivals👀\n\nGash is currently committed to Michigan State. \n\nRead: https://t.co/SNUOYVRBfQ pic.twitter.com/gQZBni46sj\n\n— Rivals (@Rivals) January 28, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

    "fullText": "Yes, the Warriors can trade for both Giannis Antetokounmpo and LeBron James. Here's how originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Giannis Antetokounmpo sweepstakes are officially here.\n\nESPN's Shams Charania reported on Wednesday that two-time NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo is \"ready for a new home\" with the Bucks listening to offers ahead of the February 5 trade deadline.\n\nAs you might imagine, it didn't take long for the rumor mill and NBA content machine to crank into hyper drive with seemingly half the league mentioned as a possible suitor. The Heat, Timberwolves, Hawks, Knicks, 76ers, Rockets, Nets and several others have all been most prominently linked to the 31-year-old future Hall of Famer. They all might be tough-pressed to match the Warriors if Mike Dunleavy Jr. puts Golden State's best foot forward.\n\nThat the Warriors are interested in Antetokounmpo should come as no surprise.\n\nWith Jimmy Butler's season-ending torn ACL, Jonathan Kuminga's trade demand, Draymond Green's unwavering commitment to drama-inducing behavior, Steve Kerr's future beyond this season in doubt and Stephen Curry's open frustration with the state of the organization, Golden State's short- and long-term prospects are hanging perilously in the balance.\n\nMORE:Ranking the best Giannis landing spots\n\nOn its own merit, pushing the chips in for Antetokounmpo would be a seismic move unto itself.\n\nBut what if the Warriors dared to dream even bigger? What if Golden State decided that acquiring the Greek Freak wasn't enough to vault back into contention? What if Joe Lacob decided to go for broke and also make a play for LeBron James?\n\nImagine the thought of a Curry-James pick and roll with Giannis waiting in the dunker spot. You'd watch, I'd watch and the those three on the same team would instantly command the respect of every other title contender... regardless of what Curry himself thinks of a potential trade.\n\nThe math works and neither the restrictive aprons nor salary caps would get in the way.\n\nHere is a hypothetical (REPEAT: HYPOTHETICAL) three-team trade that works.\n\n(Editor's note: Fanspo's NBA trade machine is by far the best one out there with updated picks, salaries, restrictions and specific conditional feedback on why trades do or don't work).\n\nWarriors get: Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, Thanasis Antetokounmpo\n\nLakers get: Draymond Green, Myles Turner, Will Richard\n\nBucks get: 4 future first-round picks, 3 pick swaps, Jimmy Butler, Jonathan Kuminga, Brandin Podziemski, Quentin Post\n\nMilwaukee badly needs to restock its draft capital if its going to enter a full rebuild. And of the teams potentially in the market for Giannis, only the Nets can rival Golden State's war chest of future picks.\n\nThe Warriors can offer up to four first-round picks along with three additional swaps. Only three are listed above as the Warriors have a top-20 protected 2030 pick owed to Washington (if that pick falls between 1-20, in this scenario it would go to Milwaukee).\n\nThe Bucks would be hedging against the Warriors' long-term future with picks out as far as 2032 when Curry would be 43, Antetokounmpo 37 and James well into retirement.\n\nButler would presumably be trade bait for next season on an expiring contract, potentially fetching additional draft compensation though his $56.8 million salary would be difficult to move. Kuminga presents an interesting low-risk upside play while this trade also allows them to move off a sizeable and lengthy commitment to Myles Turner.\n\nMORE: Tracking latest Giannis trade rumors\n\nIf the Warriors stand pat, its a signal they are content to ride out Curry's career as a middling fringe playoff or play-in team.\n\nMoving out the picks for Antetokounmpo immediately extends Golden State's window. Such is the reality when you have two of the NBA's top seven players on your roster.\n\nThe LeBron James piece of the equation is where things get really interesting. That bloated $52.6 salary complicates the money going out and Golden State's most realistic path towards getting James after sending out the money required to bring back Antetokounmpo is to include Draymond Green.\n\nThe Warriors could, instead of Green, cobble enough salary to send the Lakers between Buddy Hield, Al Horford and Moses Moody but doing some would strip what little depth remains in the first place. While breaking up the Curry-Green pairing would hurt, its also difficult to imagine Green fitting in at all offensively with Curry, Antetokounmpo AND James.\n\nThat Curry-Green chemistry can't be replicated but if there's one player on the planet with the IQ to pull off a reasonably proxy overnight, its James. Golden State would probably want some assurances that James would come back for at least one more full season, but even if he doesn't, there's not much tread left on Green's tires either.\n\nBeyond the basketball fit, one also wonders if its simply time. If Kerr and the organization at large is simply worn down and ready to move on, perhaps swapping out Green for James may inject some energy back into Steve Kerr.\n\nMORE:Klay Thompson's dad weighed in on the Giannis rumors\n\nThere's a growing sense of frustration within the Lakers and that was before ESPN's bombshell about the Buss family and potential turbulence with the James relationship.\n\nIn this scenario, the Lakers functionally swap James for Turner and Green in a frontcourt overhaul. Both Turner and Green offer significant upgrades defensively, Turner offers some stretchiness from the 5 to open things up for Luka Doncic and Green would surely be motivated to play with an Everest-sized chip on his shoulder.\n\nMORE:LeBron admits 'no way' he imagined playing on Lakers for 8 years\n\nTurner is under contract for three more seasons with the third a player option while Green owns a player option for next season. Moving James now, even for players with longer commitments, also means they won't have the discount haggling sure to happen this season with James and agent Rich Paul. There are already reports that the Lakers would ask James to take a significant discount, something he's in the past shown no willingness to consider.\n\nIf the Lakers did say yes, it probably also means finding a taker for Deandre Ayton who has an $8 million player option for next year but will surely opt out. If the Lakers could turn Ayton into another shooter, they would fully hand the on-ball keys to Doncic and Austin Reaves with more complementary pieces around the fringes.\n\nIs that more exciting than having LeBron James? Absolutely not. But it does give JJ Redick more outs and roster flexibility.\n\nThere's a million reasons trades like this never happen. It's a massive reset involving three teams with onerous contracts, bloated egos, luxury tax and apron implications and so much more.\n\nWill this happen? Almost assuredly not.\n\nCan it happen? Anything is impossible!",

    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO (AP) — Brooks Koepka felt nerves he had not experienced in years. The swagger that was such a hallmark of his five major championships was replaced by concern about the reception he would get upon his return to the PGA Tour after nearly four years on Saudi-funded LIV Golf.\n\nKoepka didn't make a birdie until his final hole Thursday. He failed to break par on the tough South course at Torrey Pines in the Farmers Insurance Open.\n\nAnd there was a small measure of relief.\n\n“I’m just grateful to be out here and have a chance to compete with these guys,” Koepka said.\n\nA large gallery followed him around on a glorious day along the Pacific bluffs with occasional shouts of, “Welcome back, Brooks.” On his way to the second tee, two young boys called out to him and Koepka walked over for fist bumps. He walked the entire 30 yards of a fence where fans wanted his autograph after his 1-over 73.\n\n“I care about what everybody’s thinking out here, what everybody’s doing, and just trying to be as good of a person and good of a player as I can be,” Koepka said. “Just wanted a warm reception. Just like everybody else, you walk into a room, nobody wants to feel exiled. They just want to be loved.”\n\nKoepka was freed from the final year of his nine-figure contract with LIV Golf on Dec. 23, applied for his PGA Tour membership about two weeks later and in three days was provided a path back.\n\nThe hard part was how he would be received. That's what brought the relief, and a big smile even after a round in which he hit the ball cleanly and couldn't buy a putt. The 8-footer for birdie on the 18th was the longest putt he made all day.\n\n“I'm the only one in the entire world that’s going through this situation so it’s very difficult to explain,” Koepka said. “But I’m enjoying it, I really am.”\n\nAnd now he has company, with former Masters champion Patrick Reed leaving LIV Golf with a chance to return to the PGA Tour as early as September. Koepka didn't see that coming and only learned about it during his pro-am Wednesday.\n\n“Yeah, it's wild,” Koepka said. “Whatever Patrick wants to do and to be the best golfer he can be, best for his family, I'm in full support of that.”\n\nKoepka said he felt nervous on the first tee, though it didn't show. He piped his drive 301 yards at sea level into the fairway, one of his better iron shots of the day to 10 feet and missed his putt.\n\n“I guess I should have been more nervous the rest of the round,” Koepka said.\n\nThe South course is among the strongest on the PGA Tour, producing more pars than any excitement. Koepka missed birdie chances on both par 5s on the front nine, and he made a sloppy bogey on the par-5 13th when his flip wedge up the steep hill to a flag he couldn't see was too strong and went into the rough behind the green.\n\nHe was 11 shots behind Justin Rose, who had a 62 on the easier North course, and eight shots worse than Seamus Power, who had a 65 for the low score on the South.\n\n“It’s been a while since I played competitive golf, so I like the way I’m playing,” said Koepka, who last played Oct. 5 at the Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland. “I just need to kind of play my way into it.”\n\nHis departure to LIV Golf in 2022 — one of the biggest surprises among the players who left the PGA Tour for the guaranteed Saudi riches — felt much longer ago. Koepka couldn't recall if he heard any comments outside the ropes in Portland when he made his LIV debut.\n\nAnd he wasn't sure what to expect in San Diego.\n\n“I don’t like thinking ahead at all or trying to anticipate what was going to happen, but I wasn’t sure, which is kind of weird being uneasy,” he said. “From the first tee on, it was great. It actually made me settle down a little bit. Like I said, it made me feel good just to be out here.”\n\nKoepka is in the Phoenix Open next week. He is not in the $20 million signature events unless he qualifies. His return also stipulates a $5 million charity donation, no access to PGA Tour equity shares for five years, no FedEx Cup bonus money he might earn this year.\n\nThe tour also said whenever Koepka plays he will be added to the field to not take a spot from anyone. And then two more players get into tournaments on Monday of tournament week to make sure every group is a threesome.\n\nThe two beneficiaries this week were Jackson Suber and Lanto Griffin, a big deal to Griffin because Torrey Pines is his favorite course and he otherwise would not be in except for Koepka.\n\nThat led Griffin to say jokingly, “If Brooks really wants to create some goodwill, he should enter every tournament and then withdraw on Tuesday.”\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",

    "fullText": "Justin Rose conjured a bogey-free 10-under par 62 to grab the first-round lead at Torrey Pines, where Brooks Koepka showed signs of rust but basked in a warm welcome on his return to the PGA Tour on Thursday.\n\nFive-time major winner Koepka's return -- after he jumped ship to the divisive Saudi-backed LIV Golf league that rocked the global game -- had dominated the build-up to the Farmers' Insurance Open.\n\nKoepka, who hadn't played a non-major PGA Tour event since the 2022 WGC Match Play, carded a one-over par 73 on Torrey Pines' South Course, where he said his reception from fans helped quell his first-tee nerves.\n\n\"I just cared about my perception, what people thought or what the fans thought,\" Koepka said. \"It's easy when you're around the players and they come and talk to you or you talk to them, or caddies or people around here, but everybody else, I wasn't sure.\"\n\nIn the end, he said, the fans were \"awesome\".\n\n\"It was very cool to hear 'welcome back,' it was pretty much every hole.\"\n\nPlaying the tougher of two courses in use over the first two rounds, Koepka found a fairway bunker on the way to a bogey at the fourth and dropped another shot at the 13th.\n\nHe made his lone birdie of the day at the par-five 18th, where his second shot went through the green but he chipped to eight feet and made the putt.\n\n\"I felt like it was pretty good,\" Koepka said, noting he hadn't played a competitive round in 14 weeks.\n\n\"I struck it really well. I didn't hit enough fairways ... didn't really make any putts besides 18 right there.\n\n\"It's been a while since I played competitive golf, so I like the way I'm playing, I just need to kind of play my way into it.\"\n\nKoepka's move back to the PGA Tour, which had banned players that jumped to LIV, comes under a new returning member program that includes limitations on eligibility for some top events, and a five-year forfeiture of rights to participate in the PGA's player equity program.\n\nKoepka, who is also making a $5 million charitable donation as one of the conditions of his reinstatement, said the speed at which the puzzle pieces fell in place had \"kind of blown my mind.\"\n\n\"I'm just grateful to be out here and have a chance to compete with these guys,\" he said.\n\nHe'll need to go low on Friday to have a chance to make the cut.\n\nRose, the 2013 US Open champion, torched the North Course with 10 birdies, just missing an 11th at his final hole, the par-five ninth, that would have given him the course record.\n\n\"It's funny how you can walk off frustrated for sure,\" said Rose, who said he second-guessed himself on the tricky birdie putt.\n\n\"But, listen, I made my share out there today. My process was fantastic. I feel like I managed my game really, really well today.\n\n\"I didn't feel like I played perfect golf so it's a good reminder that you don't always have to play perfect golf but it was good enough,\" added Rose, who was one stroke in front of American Justin Lower.\n\nJapan's Hideki Matsuyama picked up five strokes in his last five holes with an eagle and three birdies to grab a share of third on eight-under 64, tied with American Max Greyserman.\n\nIreland's Seamus Power had the round of the day on the South Course, carding a seven-under 65 to share fifth place alongside Germany's Stephan Jaeger and American Maverick McNealy.",

    "description": "In his return from LIV Golf, Brooks Koepka got a welcoming reception in the Farmers Insurance Open while shooting 73 on the South Course",
    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO — The temperature at Torrey Pines already had risen to an inviting mid-60s at 9:30 a.m. on Thursday when Brooks Koepka stepped onto the first tee of the South Course. The weather was unseasonably warm and comfortable, with not a cloud in the sky—basically mirroring the feeling and reception the five-time major winner got as he returned to the PGA Tour after a 3½-year absence while competing on LIV Golf.\n\nMORE: The other side of Brooks Koepka\n\nMaybe it was just sleepy morning for fans on the cliffs above the Pacific Ocean, but there were no wild cheers from a gallery of a couple hundred. A few people shouted, “Love you, Brooks,” and others offered, “welcome back!” Koepka’s group partner, past Farmers Open winner Max Homa, drew louder support.\n\nOn the other hand—and probably more meaningful to Koepka—there was not a single audible jeer for the man who was among the most high-profile American players to depart for a controversial league while making more than $150 million doing it. The only heckling Koepka seemed to get was after the round when an obnoxious man loudly and repeatedly asked him to sign a golf ball following the golfer spending 15 minutes working along an autograph line of mostly kids. \"I'm your biggest fan!\" the guy bellowed, but that still didn't get him a signature.\n\nKoepka would admit after the round that he was feeling more nervous than he had in quite a while but hardly looked shaky while striping his opening drive into the fairway.\n\nA page turned on a new chapter of his life.\n\n“Yeah, it was great. The fans were awesome today,” Koepka said. “I think it was very cool to hear ‘welcome back.’ It was pretty much every hole, which is great. I loved to hear it and I'm excited for the next few days.”\n\nHe admitted why he was concerned about the reaction.\n\n“I just cared about my perception, what people thought or what the fans thought,” he said. “It's easy when you're around the players and they come and talk to you or you talk to them, or caddies or people around here, but everybody else, I wasn't sure.”\n\nWhile saying he was feeling jitters on the first tee, Koepka deadpanned, “I guess I should have been more nervous the rest of the round.\" He made only one birdie—on the 18th hole—in shooting one-over-par 73 on the two-time U.S. Open course.\n\nTied for 101st place after Round 1, Koepka could perhaps take solace in being even with his former U.S. Ryder Cup teammates, Xander Schauffee and Patrick Cantlay, and defending Farmers Open champion Harris English. He also bested his two playing partners, with Homa shooting 75 and Ludvig Aberg, who won the Genesis Invitational at Torrey Pines last February, struggling to a 78.\n\nThat’s how tough the South Course is and Koepka was playing his first competitive round since the DP World Tour’s Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in early October.\n\n“It felt good,” said Koepka, who hit only six fairways, but more than doubled his greens reached with 13. “It's been a while since I played competitive golf, so I like the way I'm playing; I just need to kind of play my way into it.”\n\nOne of the primary reasons, Kopeka has said, for his return to the PGA Tour is the desire to spend more time with his family, and he said his wife, Jena Sims, and their 3½-year-old son, Crew, would be out at Torrey Pines this week. They weren't on the grounds on Thursday but can be expected later in the week.\n\nAs it was for Tuesday’s news conference, Koepka’s demeanor was seemingly a blend of restraint and earnestness. At one point, he said he had “fallen back in love with the game” while watching Crew begin to show interest in it.\n\n“I guess I want him to watch me play well,” he said, “and realize how much this game’s given me, how fun it is, and how cool it is to just be out here.”",

    "description": "The Steve Aoki concert cake throw is a signature for the Grammy-nominated DJ, and a guest appearance by Diego Lopes stands out.",
    "fullText": "Steve Aoki is a major UFC fan, so much so that he's invited multiple fighters on stage at his concerts through the years, and also DJ'd the wedding of former bantamweight champion Aljamain Sterling.\n\nThe Grammy-nominated artist and producer moved his schedule around to attend this past Saturday's UFC 324 event in Las Vegas and has a number of favorites on the roster. One name repeatedly came to Aoki's mind when discussing his UFC fandom with MMA Junkie on the UFC 324 red carpet, especially when asked who he thinks has done the best cake throw into the crowd, which is a signature of his performances.\n\nThat man is UFC 325 headliner Diego Lopes (27-7 MMA, 6-2 UFC), who faces Alexander Volkanovski (27-4 MMA, 14-3 UFC) in a rematch for the featherweight title Saturday at Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney (Paramount+).\n\n\"Diego, I would have to say, was very impressive,\" Aoki told MMA Junkie. \"We were in Mexico together, and I played in Puebla in his city where he trains. This was the second time we caked. We did it before when he was with me in Guadalajara. The crowd was at least 25 feet away. I did not think he was going to make it over there, because it's difficult.\n\n\"There's a real art to cake throwing. It's not like you can pick up a cake, and you can actually nail someone in the face. It's actually difficult. He actually launched it, and it got some head shots. I was impressed. There is evidence of him nailing some amazing head shots. So I think Diego is one of the best fighting IQs, for sure, for me when I watch him, and he definitely has the cake IQ, too.\"\n\nLopes shared the video of the cake throw Aoki mentioned from November 2024. He still holds up the spot as No. 1 cake thrower more than a year later, and now he'll try to add the distinction of No. 1 featherweight in the world to his resume, as well.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: DJ Steve Aoki names Diego Lopes as best UFC cake thrower",

Via a press release, this will mark the first time a Super Bowl and Olympic Games will be presented in 4K HDR on the NBC broadcast network and the Peacock.\n\nIn a statement, Rick Cordella, President of NBC Sports, believes that because February will be a huge month for sports for the network, they feel obligated to deliver the best viewing experience possible.\n\n“When you’re about to present the biggest month in U.S. sports media history, you want to make sure you’re giving fans the best experience possible – so that’s exactly what we have planned on NBC and Peacock for Super Bowl LX, the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, and NBA All-Star Weekend,” said Cordella. “Building on NBC Sports’ long-standing commitment to innovation across all platforms, we’ll be celebrating the action on the field, slopes, and court with our signature storytelling, state-of-the-art production, and dynamic streaming features that together bring these incredible sporting events to life for audiences at home.”\n\nThe platform will be presenting other innovations with their Olympic coverage by expanding their Multiview feature to mobile, which activates a four-box vertical display that showcases the top four events at any given time. Patrick Miceli, Chief Technology Officer, NBCUniversal Media Group and Global Streaming, states Peacock leads the industry in preesnting high profile events due to their infrastructure.\n\n“Peacock is the first streamer to deliver major live sports at this scale, seamlessly presenting many simultaneous events, with millions of people coming to the platform at once, over several days,” said Patrick Miceli, Chief Technology Officer, NBCUniversal Media Group and Global Streaming. “This impressive performance is possible because of Peacock’s industry-leading infrastructure that supports unmatched reliability, especially under peak demand.”\n\nPeacock’s February doesn’t stop with the Olympics and the Super Bowl, as for the first time in over 20 years, NBC will produce NBA All-Star Weekend onsite in Los Angeles.",

    "fullText": "“No Mercy” will be on ice for a bit — literally and figuratively.\n\nTwo-time Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Bantamweight champion Petr Yan will be out of action until at least summer 2026 after undergoing a minor back procedure, a development that was confirmed by his longtime manager, Danny Rubenstein.\n\n“He had a minor procedure on his lower back that he went into the Merab fight with,” Rubenstein told MMA Junkie recently. “He’ll be ready in July.”\n\nWhile the surgery is considered minor, it makes his performance last month even more impressive as the Russian standout powered through the issue and reclaimed the Bantamweight title with a dominant victory over Merab Dvalishvili at UFC 323, extending his winning streak to four straight.\n\nThe timing of the injury is unfortunate for fans, as Yan is widely regarded as one of the most skilled and entertaining fighters in the division. However, the layoff does allow both Yan and Dvalishvili ample time to recover and prepare for what appears to be an inevitable rubber match later this year.\n\nThe setback also eliminates any chance of Yan competing on the historic UFC White House card scheduled for June, a bout many had speculated could include a rematch against former champion Sean O’Malley. With Yan unavailable, “Sugar” will have to look elsewhere if he hopes to secure a spot on that high-profile event.\n\nIf the promotion wants to get wonky, an interim title fight involving O’Malley isn’t out of the question — setting up a unification bout once Yan returns to full health. Whether the UFC goes that route remains to be seen.\n\nFor now, the priority is Yan’s recovery. Assuming everything goes according to plan, the Bantamweight king should be back in the title picture by midsummer — and when he returns, the division will once again have its most dangerous technician at full strength.",

Webb is reportedly taking his name out of consideration to be the next head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders, so that could pave the way for that.\n\nNix called his own press conference to address his broken ankle, clearing up and correcting some of what Payton said following the injury.\n\nDid not have Bo Nix calling his own press conference & addressing Sean Payton’s over sharing of his injuries on today’s bingo card. They’ll work through it but clearly not on the same page at the moment. pic.twitter.com/R7ad90EgjM\n\n— Zach Bye (@byesline) January 29, 2026\n\nNow, there is no doubt that Nix and Payton have respect for each other, but how much do they really like one another? The two have had heated spats during games before, so if you want to chalk this latest story up to anything minor, you're badly missing the boat.\n\nThis is something that could become a serious disturbance for this team. The Broncos have a strong head coach and a great young quarterback, but are they on the same page? Do they like working together?\n\nThis is where Webb comes in. He is that bridge between the coach and the player and he will be the glue that keeps what the team has going together. That makes him a guy the Broncos can't allow to get out the door.\n\nAccording to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, the Broncos were looking to offer their offensive coordinator job to Joe Brady, who was hired as the new head coach of the Buffalo Bills. Hours later, the Broncos fired Lombardi, seemingly paving the way for Webb to be promoted into that role.\n\nREAD:Broncos' two huge offseason signings could already be on their way out\n\nNow that Webb is apparently taking himself out of the running for the Raiders job, the Broncos need to make it official.\n\nBroncos' Vance Joseph may be down to just one possibility to be head coach in 2026\n\nBroncos sign Deuce Vaughn, 6 other players to future contracts\n\nBroncos Schedule: Which opponents will Denver face in 2026?\n\nBroncos must do everything in their power to sign 27-TD free-agent running back",

    "fullText": "A docuseries examining the evolution and impact of Black quarterbacks in professional football, Field Generals: History of the Black Quarterback, will debut on Peacock on Thursday, Feb. 5. New episodes will stream weekly on Thursdays, chronicling the stories of trailblazing quarterbacks from the AFL-NFL merger through the turn of the century who faced systemic barriers and cultural challenges while reshaping one of the most scrutinized positions in sports.\n\nThe series explores how Black quarterbacks were often steered away from the position, questioned for their leadership and intelligence, and forced to overcome entrenched stereotypes both on and off the field. Through archival footage, interviews and historical context, Field Generals traces how these athletes helped redefine what success at quarterback looks like in the NFL and paved the way for future generations.\n\nNBC Sports’ Maria Taylor serves as an executive producer alongside Michael Yarvitz, Bill Wolff, Andrew Singer and Eddie Michaels. Rikki Hughes serves as both director and executive producer. The docuseries is produced in association with NFL Films, with Jessica Boddy, Keith Cossrow, Ken Rodgers and Ross Ketover serving as executive producers.\n\nThe series features firsthand perspectives from a wide range of former and current Black quarterbacks, including James “Shack” Harris, Warren Moon, Doug Williams, Randall Cunningham, Vince Evans, Chuck Ealey, Rodney Peete, Donovan McNabb, Michael Vick and Lamar Jackson.\n\nAdditional voices include journalists, executives, and cultural commentators who help frame the broader social and historical significance of the position, such as Michael Wilbon, Rich McKay, Joe Gibbs, Michael Eric Dyson, Jayne Kennedy, Bomani Jones, Michael Beschloss and Bob Costas.\n\nThe series trailer can be viewed here.",

    "fullText": "According to ESPN’s lead NFL insider, Adam Schefter, Denver Broncos pass game coordinator/quarterbacks coach Davis Webb is withdrawing from consideration for the Las Vegas Raiders head coaching job.\n\nWebb has had several offensive coordinator requests recently and is a prime candidate to become the Denver Broncos offensive coordinator, according to NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport.\n\nBroncos passing game coordinator Davis Webb is withdrawing from consideration from the Raiders head coaching job, per source. Webb interviewed for head coaching jobs with the Raiders, Bills and Ravens. pic.twitter.com/4FYpPGQ0MX\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 30, 2026\n\nDavis Webb was considered a favorite for the Las Vegas Raiders head coaching job, but all signs point to them favoring Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak instead. Both the Cardinals and the Raiders are waiting until this weekend to meet with him in hopes of hiring him after the Super Bowl. With the writing on the wall and likely not wanting to be the backup option, Webb withdrew his name from consideration.\n\nWith Webb officially out of the Raiders’ head coaching search, he becomes one of the hottest offensive coordinator names currently on the market. Several teams, including the Baltimore Ravens, New York Giants, and Philadelphia Eagles (before they hired their OC earlier today) have already put in requests to interview Webb for their offensive coordinator positions. Also, his current team, the Denver Broncos, fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi and would like to promote Webb to offensive coordinator if possible.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Webb will interview with the Ravens, Giants, or any other teams for their offensive coordinator jobs. He has impressed in interviews, is viewed as an up-and-coming coach, and is well-liked and regarded around the league so it would make sense for teams to be interested. However, with the Broncos firing Lombardi and opening up their offensive coordinator position, you have to assume there is mutual interest between the two sides and that the Broncos are the favorites to land him as their offensive coordinator.\n\nWebb would benefit from another year under Sean Payton and would get more valuable experience as his offensive coordinator. While he may not call plays, he would be in the booth, communicating with Payton throughout the game, and would be a key part of game-planning each week.\n\nThere is no guarantee that Webb will return to the Broncos, as other teams can and likely will offer him play-calling opportunities, but I believe they will make a strong push for him. This should unfold in the coming days, and hopefully, Webb returns to the Broncos, this time, as their offensive coordinator.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe playoffs are often where players' reputations are enhanced, or they are ruined, and for Houston Texans quarterback C.J.

Do the Texans pay Stroud franchise quarterback money?\n\nThe fact that we are even asking that tells you all you need to know.\n\nAnd for PFF's John Kosko, this isn't a great spot for C.J. or the Texans to be in.\n\n\"A year ago, he went throw-for-throw with Patrick Mahomes in the divisional round, as both quarterbacks produced three big-time throws,\" Kosko writes. \"What followed in the postseason this year needs little explanation. Stroud’s 32.3 overall grade underscored how much he struggled to take the next step.\n\n\"Performances like that can derail a promising trajectory, making 2026 a critical prove-it season for Stroud to show this was merely a blip rather than a turning point.\"\n\nMore: Jarrett Stidham’s opening drive against New England only made things worse for C.J. Stroud\n\nShould they, and will they, are two different questions.\n\nShould they? Possibly. Will they? Likely yes.\n\nAnd the reason is that Stroud is entering the final year of his rookie deal, before the Texans can pick up his option, so there will be two seasons that the franchise will be able to evaluate C.J. and decide if they want to offer him top QB money.\n\nIn an ideal world, entering Year 4, you already know if you want to extend your QB, but the fact that we have so many questions aimed at Stroud isn't ideal.\n\nYear 4 is going to be a defining one for C.J.\n\nESPN hints at major reason Todd Monken moved on from Ravens\n\nDrake Maye injury update: Patriots' Mike Vrabel addresses QB concerns\n\nChiefs coach unknowingly drops monster update on Travis Kelce's future\n\nDolphins predicted to replace Tua Tagovailoa with backup QB\n\nBills urged to sign All-Pro weapon for Josh Allen\n\nRavens must answer $17 million question this offseason",

    "fullText": "While the top two teams in the NFL prepare for the Super Bowl, the Dallas Cowboys and 29 other squads are firmly fixated on talent acquisition. From coaching staff to free agency to the 2026 NFL draft, the Cowboys are treasure hunting.\n\nMidway through Senior Bowl week, some draft hopefuls are standing out amongst their peers. The hope for Cowboys fans is that some of these standouts are at positions of need for Dallas. The Cowboys need to add players at linebacker, defensive end, safety, offensive tackle and cornerback, just to name a few. As luck would have it, some of those players are indeed flashing in practice.\n\nEarly standout reports have highlighted the defensive ends who have been jumping off the screen. The one’s mentioned here at Cowboys Wire have continued their strong play and should firmly be on Dallas’ radar this April. Today we look at three more.\n\nBud Clark has been turning heads here at the midpoint. The 6-foot-1, 185-pound safety from TCU was an intriguing prospect from the start. Over the past two seasons, he’s scored the third best film grade in the country. Despite a diminutive stature, Clark has been showing up as a run defender in the box, putting to bed some size concerns about his jump to the NFL.\n\nClark has been making plays on the ball in coverage and filling gaps against the run, proving to be a do-it-all defensive back. In 2023 he played 393 snaps in the slot, but over the last two seasons he’s mixed it up evenly between slot, box and deep.\n\nClark is the ideal candidate to replace free agent Donovan Wilson for the Cowboys because he can be moved everywhere including a nickel role. Clark is rocketing up draft boards and should move into the top 100 (currently a consensus rank of 185)\n\nDeath, taxes, Bud Clark making plays at the Senior Bowl.\n\nTCU safety has been a star all week. pic.twitter.com/nm3nZWRlwP\n\n— Max Chadwick (@CFBMaxChadwick) January 29, 2026\n\nJacob Rodriguez has proven he’s every bit as advertised. The Tech standout has been everywhere on the field, picking off balls in coverage and punching out balls in the open field. In this extremely deep LB class, Rodriguez is a star.\n\nPhysical traits stand to hold him back on draft boards, but the kid is a mental giant who just makes plays. Rodriguez has set the bar at the LB position scoring the highest PFF score all time amongst Power-4 LB prospects. Given he’ll probably be a Day 2 pick, he’s going to be a steal for someone this year.\n\nTexas Tech’s Jacob Rodriguez had an all-time performance for a LB on Day 2 of the Senior Bowl. \n\nNot only did he show off his peanut punch with a forced fumble, but he also had an INT to end the day and was the best LB in coverage in one-on-ones pic.twitter.com/W8yEm4F2k7\n\n— Bobby Football (@Rob__Paul) January 29, 2026\n\nAt just under 6-foot and weighing 183 pounds, Malik Mohammad isn’t the typical tall CB the Cowboys are attracted to but he’s making it up in tenacity and stickiness at the Senior Bowl. Quick and fluid, Muhammad has shown he can stay with any build, both outside and inside.\n\nThe Cowboys are in the market for a new CB with inside ability. They felt the loss of Jourdan Lewis immensely and this prospect appears to be a great replacement option.\n\nMalik Muhammad continues to stack good rep after good rep pic.twitter.com/AQNk9J2Poz\n\n— TJ Wengert (@TJWengert) January 28, 2026\n\nYou can follow Reid on X @ReidDHanson and be sure to follow Cowboys Wire on Facebook to join in on the conversation with fellow fans!\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Midway checkpoint: 3 local Senior Bowl standouts who fit the Cowboys",

    "fullText": "Modern neuroscience understands the brain as a set of specialized systems. Aspects of brain function such as attention, perception, memory, language and thought have been mapped onto distinct brain networks, and each has been examined largely in isolation.\n\nWhile this approach has yielded major advances, it has left unresolved one of the most basic facts about human cognition: its overall unity as an integrated system.\n\nNow, researchers at the University of Notre Dame have conducted a neuroimaging study to investigate how the brain is organized and how that integrated system gives rise to intelligence.\n\n“Neuroscience has been very successful at explaining what particular networks do, but much less successful at explaining how a single, coherent mind emerges from their interaction,” said Aron Barbey, the Andrew J. McKenna Family Professor of Psychology in Notre Dame’s Department of Psychology.\n\nPsychologists have long known that areas as diverse as attention, perception, memory and language are correlated, forming what they term “general intelligence.” This accounts for how humans function and adapt in a wide range of academic, professional, social and health contexts. It shapes how efficiently we learn, reason and perform in response to a multitude of everyday problems and tasks.\n\nFor more than a century, this structure has suggested that cognition is unified at a fundamental level. What has been missing is a theory to explain why such unity exists.\n\n“The problem of intelligence is not one of functional localization,” said Barbey, who is also the director of the Notre Dame Human Neuroimaging Center and the Decision Neuroscience Laboratory. “Contemporary research often asks where general intelligence originates in the brain — focusing primarily on a specific network of regions within the frontal and parietal cortex. But the more fundamental question is how intelligence emerges from the principles that govern global brain function — how distributed networks communicate and collectively process information.”\n\nBarbey and his research team, including Notre Dame graduate student and lead author Ramsey Wilcox, investigated the predictions of the unifying framework, called the Network Neuroscience Theory. Their study was recently published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nGeneral intelligence is not itself a skill or strategy, the researchers argued. It is a pattern — the tendency for diverse abilities to be positively correlated. The study argues that this pattern reflects differences in how efficiently brain networks are organized and work together.\n\nTo test this claim, the cognitive neuroscientists analyzed brain imaging and cognitive data from one of the largest studies conducted to date, examining 831 adults in the Human Connectome Project, along with an independent sample of 145 adults in the INSIGHT Study, which was funded by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity’s SHARP program. The researchers integrated measures of both brain structure and function to enable a more precise characterization of the human brain.\n\nRather than identifying intelligence with a particular cognitive function or brain network, the Network Neuroscience Theory characterizes it as a property of how the brain works as a whole. In this view, intelligence reflects how brain networks are coordinated and dynamically reconfigured to solve the diverse problems we encounter in life.\n\nThis research represents an important shift, according to Barbey and Wilcox.\n\n“We found evidence for system-wide coordination in the brain that is both robust and adaptable,” Wilcox said. “This coordination does not carry out cognition itself, but determines the range of cognitive operations the system can support.”\n\n“Within this framework, the brain is modeled as a network whose behavior is constrained by global properties such as efficiency, flexibility and integration,” Wilcox said. “These properties are not tied to individual tasks or brain networks, but are characteristics of the system as a whole, shaping every cognitive operation without being reducible to any one of them.”\n\n“Once the question shifts from where intelligence is to how the system is organized,” Wilcox noted, “the empirical targets change.”\n\nThe researchers found evidence to support four predictions of the Network Neuroscience Theory.\n\nFirst, the theory predicts that intelligence is not localized to a single brain network but arises from processing distributed across multiple networks. Intelligence, therefore, depends on how the brain manages the division of labor across different networks and combines them as needed.\n\nSecond, for the brain to manage this distributed processing, it requires integration and effective long-range communications. To synchronize those efforts, Barbey said, there is “a large and complex system of connections that serve as ‘shortcuts’ linking distant brain regions and integrating information across the networks.” These pathways connect structurally distant areas of the brain, enabling efficient communication and supporting coordinated processing across the system.\n\nThird, effective integration requires regulatory control that coordinates interactions among networks by shaping how information flows throughout the brain. These areas serve as regulatory hubs, reaching out to other networks to orchestrate the brain’s ongoing activities. They selectively recruit the appropriate networks for the specific task at hand — whether it be piecing together subtle clues to make sense of a problem, learning a new skill or deciding whether a situation requires careful deliberation or a rapid, intuitive response.\n\nFinally, Barbey said that general intelligence depends on the brain’s ability to balance local specialization with global integration. In other words, the brain functions best when tightly connected local clusters communicate well, but are still able to link to distant regions of the brain across short communication paths. This makes the most effective problem-solving possible, according to the co-authors.\n\nThe research suggests that intelligence is unified not because the brain relies on a single general-purpose processor, but because the same organizational principles shape how all cognitive functions work together.\n\nAcross both datasets, individual differences in general intelligence were consistently associated with these system-level properties. No single region or canonical “intelligence network” accounted for the effect.\n\n“General intelligence becomes visible when cognition is coordinated,” Barbey noted, “when many processes must work together under system-level constraints.”\n\nThe implications of this study extend beyond intelligence research, he added. By grounding cognition in large-scale organization, the study offers a principled account of why the mind is unified at all.\n\nThis framework helps explain why intelligence develops broadly during childhood, declines with aging and is particularly sensitive to diffuse brain injury. In each case, it is large-scale coordination — not isolated function — that changes.\n\nThe findings also inform ongoing debates about artificial intelligence and how AI models are developed. If general intelligence in humans arises from system-level organization rather than from a dedicated general-purpose mechanism, then achieving general intelligence in artificial systems may require more than the accumulation or scaling of specialized capabilities.\n\n“This research can push us into thinking about how to use design characteristics of the human brain to motivate advances in human-centered, biologically inspired artificial intelligence,” Barbey said.\n\n“Many AI systems can perform specific tasks very well, but they still struggle to apply what they know across different situations.” Barbey said. “Human intelligence is defined by this flexibility — and it reflects the unique organization of the human brain.”\n\nThe research was conducted with co-authors Babak Hemmatian and Lav Varshney of Stony Brook University.\n\nContact: Tracy DeStazio, associate director of media relations, 574-631-9958 or tdestazi@nd.edu",

    "description": "Two Army pilots went on an ill-conceived training mission. Within two hours, 67 people were dead.",
    "fullText": "This article was featured in New York’s One Great Story newsletter. \n\nOne year ago, on January 29, 2025, two Army pilots strapped into a Black Hawk helicopter for a training mission out of Fort Belvoir in eastern Virginia and, two hours later, flew it into an airliner that was approaching Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing all 67 aboard both aircraft. It was the deadliest air disaster in the United States in a quarter-century. Normally, in the aftermath of an air crash, government investigators take a year or more to issue a final report laying out the reasons the incident occurred. But in this case, the newly seated U.S. president, Donald Trump, held a press conference the next day and blamed the accident on the FAA’s DEI under the Biden and Obama administrations. “They actually came out with a directive, ‘too white,’” he claimed. “And we want the people that are competent.”\n\nIn the months that followed, major media outlets probed several real-world factors that contributed to the tragedy, including staffing shortages at FAA towers, an excess of traffic in the D.C. airspace, and the failure of the Black Hawk to broadcast its location over ADS-B — an automatic reporting system — before the collision. To address this final point, the Senate last month passed the bipartisan ROTOR Act, which would require all aircraft to use ADS-B — “a fitting way to honor the lives of those lost nearly one year ago over the Potomac River,” as bill co-sponsor Ted Cruz put it.\n\nAt a public meeting on Tuesday, the National Transport Safety Board laid out a list of recommended changes in response to the crash, criticizing the FAA for allowing helicopters to operate dangerously close to passenger planes and for allowing professional standards to slip at the control tower.\n\nWhat has gone unexamined in the public discussion of the crash, however, is why these particular pilots were on this mission in the first place, whether they were competent to do what they were trying to do, what adverse conditions they were facing, and who was in charge at the moment of impact. Ultimately, while systemic issues may have created conditions that were ripe for a fatal accident, it was human decision-making in the cockpit that was the immediate cause of this particular crash.\n\nThis account is based on documents from the National Transportation Board (NTSB) accident inquiry and interviews with aviation experts. It shows that, when we focus on the specific details and facts of a case, the cause can seem quite different from what a big-picture overview might indicate. And this, in turn, suggests different logical steps that should be taken to prevent such a tragedy from happening again.\n\nThe whine of the Blackhawk’s engine increased in pitch, and the whump-whump of its four rotor blades grew louder, as the matte-black aircraft lifted into the darkened sky above the single mile-long runway at Davison Army Airfield in Fairfax County, Virginia, about 25 miles southwest of Washington, D.C.\n\nThe UH-60, as it’s formally designated, is an 18,000-pound aircraft that entered service in 1979 as a tactical transport aircraft, used primarily for moving troops and equipment. This one belonged to Company B of the 12th Aviation Battalion, whose primary mission is to transport government VIPs, including Defense Department officials, members of Congress, and visiting dignitaries. Tonight’s flight would operate as PAT 25, for “Priority Air Transit.”\n\nBlack Hawks are typically flown by two pilots. The pilot in command, or PIC, sits in the right-hand seat. Tonight, that role was filled by 39-year-old chief warrant officer Andrew Eaves. Warrant officers rank between enlisted personnel and commissioned officers; it’s the warrant officers who carry out the lion’s share of a unit’s operational flying. When not flying VIPs, Eaves served as a flight instructor and a check pilot, providing periodic evaluation of the skills of other pilots. A native of Mississippi, he had 968 hours of flight experience and was considered a solid pilot by others in the unit.\n\nBefore he took off, Eaves’ commander had discussed the flight with him and admonished him to “not become too fixated on his evaluator role” and to remain “in control of the helicopter,” according to the NTSB investigation.\n\nHis mission was to give a check ride to Captain Rebecca Lobach, the pilot sitting in the left-hand seat. Lobach was a staff officer, meaning that her main role in the battalion was managerial. Nevertheless, she was expected to maintain her pilot qualifications and, to do so, had to undergo a number of annual proficiency checks. Tonight’s three-hour flight was intended to get Lobach her annual sign-off for basic flying skills and for the use of night-vision goggles, or NVGs. To accommodate that, the flight was taking off an hour and 20 minutes after sunset.\n\nBoth pilots wore AN/AVS-6(V)3 Night Vision Goggles, which look like opera glasses and clip onto the front of a pilot’s helmet. They gather ambient light, whether from the moon or stars or from man-made sources; intensify it; and display it through the lens of each element. The eyepiece doesn’t sit directly on the face but about an inch away, so the pilot can look down under it and see the instrument panel.\n\nNight-vision goggles have a narrow field of view, just 40 degrees compared to the 200-degree range of normal vision, which makes it harder for pilots to maintain full situational awareness. They have to pay attention to obstacles and other aircraft outside the window, and they also have to keep track of what the gauges on the panel in front them are saying: how fast they’re going, for instance, and how high. There’s a lot to process, and time is of the essence when you’re zooming along at 120 mph while lower than the tops of nearby buildings. To help with situational awareness, Eaves and Lobach were accompanied by a crew chief, Staff Sergeant Ryan O’Hara, sitting in a seat just behind the cockpit, where he would be able to help keep an eye out for trouble.\n\nThe helicopter turned to the south as it climbed, then flew along the eastern shore of the Potomac until the point where the river makes a big bend to the east. Eaves banked to the right and headed west toward the commuter suburb of Vicksburg, where the lights of house porches and street lamps seemed to twinkle as they fell in and out of the cover of the bare tree branches.\n\nPAT 25 followed the serpentine course of the Rapidan River through the hills and farm fields of the Piedmont. At this point, Eaves was not only the pilot in command, but also the pilot flying, meaning that he had his hands on the controls that guide the aircraft’s speed and direction and his feet on the rudder pedals that keep the helicopter “in trim” — that is, lined up with its direction of flight. Lobach played a supporting role, working the radio, keeping an eye out for obstacles and other traffic, and figuring out their location by referencing visible landmarks.\n\nLobach, 28, had been a pilot for four years. She’d been an ROTC cadet at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which she graduated from in 2019. Both her parents were doctors; she’d dreamed of a medical career but eventually realized that she couldn’t pursue one in the Army. According to her roommate, “She did not have a huge, massive passion” for aviation but chose it because it was the closest she could get to practicing medicine, under the circumstances. “She badly wanted to be a Black Hawk pilot because she wanted to be a medevac unit,” he told NTSB investigators. After she completed flight training at Fort Rucker, she was stationed at Fort Belvoir, where she joined the 12th Aviation Battalion and was put in charge of the oil-and-lubricants unit. One fellow pilot in the unit described her to the NTSB as “incredibly professional, very diligent and very thorough.”\n\nIn addition to her official duties, Lobach served as a volunteer social liaison at the White House, where she regularly represented the Army at Medal of Honor ceremonies and state dinners. She was both a fitness fanatic and a baker, known for providing fresh sourdough bread to her unit. She had started dabbling in real-estate investments and looked forward to moving in with her boyfriend of one year, another Army pilot with whom she talked about having “lots and lots of babies.” She was planning to leave the service in 2027 and had already applied for medical school at Mount Sinai. Helicopter flying was not something she intended to pursue.\n\nThough talented as a manager, she wasn’t much of a pilot. Helicopter flying is an extremely demanding feat of coordination and balance, akin to juggling and riding a unicycle at the same time. For Lobach, the difficulty was compounded by the fact that she had trained on highly automated, relatively easy-to-fly helicopters at Fort Rucker and then been assigned to an older aircraft, the Black Hawk L or “Lima” model, at Fort Belvoir. Unlike newer models, which can maintain their altitude on autopilot, the Lima requires constant care and attention, and Lobach struggled to master it. One instructor described her skills as “well below average,” noting that she had “lots of difficulties in the aircraft.” Three years before, she’d failed the night-vision evaluation she was taking tonight.\n\nBefore the flight, Eaves had told his girlfriend that he was concerned about Lobach’s capability as a pilot and that, skill-wise, she was “not where she should be.”\n\nIt’s not uncommon for pilots to struggle during the early phase of their career. But Lobach’s development had been particularly slow. In her five years in the service, she had accumulated just 454 hours of flight time, and she wasn’t clocking more very quickly. The Army requires officers in her role to fly at least 60 hours a year, but in the past 12 months, she’d flown only 56.7. Her superiors had made an exception for her because in March she’d had knee surgery for a sports injury, preventing her from flying for three months. The waiver made her technically qualified to fly, but it didn’t change the fact that she was rustier than pilots were normally allowed to become.\n\nIf she’d been keen on flying, she could have used every moment of this flight to hone her skills by taking the controls herself. But she was content to let Eaves do the flying during the first part of the trip.\n\nDrawing near to Greenhouse Airport, a small, private grass runway near a plant nursery, they navigated via an old-fashioned technique called pilotage, using landmarks and dead reckoning to find their way from point to point. Coming in for their first landing of the night, they were looking for the airstrip’s signature greenhouse complex.\n\nLobach: That large lit building may be part of it.\n\nEaves: It does look like a greenhouse, doesn’t it?\n\nLobach: Yeah, it does, doesn’t it? We can start slowing back.\n\nEaves: All right, slowing back.\n\nAs they circled around the runway, Eaves commented that the lighting of the greenhouse building was so intense that it was blinding in the NVGs, and Lobach agreed. Eaves positioned the helicopter a few hundred feet above the landing zone and asked Lobach to show him where it was. After she did so correctly, he told her to take the controls. This process followed a formalized set of acknowledgements to make sure that both parties understood who was in control of the aircraft.\n\nEaves: You’ve got the flight controls.\n\nAs Lobach eased the helicopter toward the ground, Eaves and Crew Chief O’Hara called out times from the landing checklist.\n\nO’Hara: Clear of obstacles on the left.\n\nLobach: Thank you. Coming forward.\n\nThey touched down. One minute and 42 seconds after passing control to Lobach, Eaves took it back again. As they sat on the ground with their rotor whirring, they discussed the fuel remaining aboard the aircraft and the direction they would travel in during the next segment of their flight. Finally, after six minutes, Eaves signaled that they were ready to take off again.\n\nEaves: Whenever you’re ready, ma’am.\n\nEaves’s deference to Lobach was symptomatic of what is known among psychologists as an “inverted authority gradient.” Although he was the pilot in command, both responsible for the flight and in a position of authority over others on it, Eaves held a lesser rank than Lobach and so in a broader context was her subordinate. In moments of high stress, this ambiguity can muddy the waters as to who is supposed to be making crucial decisions.\n\nEaves, Lobach, and O’Hara ran through their checklists, and Eaves eased the Black Hawk up into the night sky.\n\nThey headed north, bending to the east to avoid Culpeper Airport to their left. The scattering of lights beneath them was sparse as they passed over the rural foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Cruising at an altitude of 2,000 feet, the aircraft hit rough air.\n\nIt was a complaint Lobach continued to make throughout the night. A cold front was moving through the area, bringing winds that gusted up to 45 mph. The wind wasn’t dangerous, but it kept pushing the aircraft off its flight path and caused constant unexpected jerks. It was another stress factor in a night that already had plenty.\n\nTwo minutes later, Lobach declared that she was taking control of the aircraft. Eaves sounded surprised.\n\nLobach: I got the flight controls.\n\nEaves: Yup, you got flight controls.\n\nEaves: You do have flight controls. Sorry about that.\n\nLobach pointed out that they had descended below their intended altitude of 2,000 feet and were now at 1,600 feet. Eaves was confused, then realized that he had misread the altimeter display.\n\nThe fact that Eaves would make such a mistake is a reminder that, while he was a much more experienced and proficient pilot than Lobach, he, too, was a pilot with less than a thousand hours of flight time. In order to even start a career as an airline pilot in the U.S., you need a minimum of 1,500 hours.\n\nThe 12th Aviation Battalion is an elite unit with a glamorous and high-stakes mission: flying government officials and VIPs around in the nation’s capital. A decade ago, it was staffed by experienced aviators who would build flight time elsewhere before being transferred to the unit. But in recent years, it had begun accepting pilots straight out of flight school. “The unit is strapped for resources,” Lobach’s roommate told the NTSB. “They have struggled with staffing issues in general.”\n\nSimilar problems exist throughout Army aviation; the service has been having a hard time retaining its most experienced pilots and providing adequate flight time for those currently coming up through the ranks. Since 2011, the average number of hours flown per year by crewed Army aircraft has fallen from 302 to 198.\n\nLobach continued to fret about the wind, while Eaves seemed unfazed.\n\nLobach: Strong headwind right now.\n\nLobach: Uh, pretty strong headwind.\n\nShe pointed out that even though the airspeed indicator had the helicopter moving at 110 knots, the GPS was showing their groundspeed as 93 knots, implying a headwind of 17 knots or 20 mph.\n\nAfter Lobach again commented on how choppy the conditions were, Eaves took control back, just a minute and 48 seconds after he had relinquished it. In the first hour of flying time, Lobach had been operating the controls for a total of three and a half minutes.\n\nPAT 25 was skirting the edge of the busy restricted airspace around Dulles and Reagan, a three-dimensional imaginary blob 90 miles across with corridors cut through at low altitudes for helicopter traffic. It’s a complicated and busy environment that encompasses three major airports and three military airbases and is patrolled by military helicopters from three different branches of the military. Some transport VIPs, others hunt and intercept drones and aircraft that shouldn’t be in this highly sensitive space.\n\nTo be clear, there was no need for PAT 25 to be messing around in this airspace. All Lobach needed to do on this flight was demonstrate her proficiency with night-vision goggles and her skill at operating the aircraft. They could have done everything in the much quieter region around Greenhouse Airport, and other flight instructors routinely did. “I would go kind of west and south, for the most part,” says Austin Roth, a former instructor pilot in the 12th Aviation Battalion who flew with Eaves and even once gave him a check ride. “That was my preference.”\n\nAs they passed over the Civil War battlefield of Thoroughfare Gap, an alarm called a master caution went off, indicating that a control system for a tail fin was malfunctioning. If the situation worsened and the surface became stuck, the helicopter could crash. Lobach immediately started to run an emergency checklist. To their relief, they were able to reset the system without difficulty.\n\nOnce everything was sorted out, Eaves took a moment to critique her performance.\n\nEaves: “So how’s that supposed to look, ma’am?”\n\nLobach: “That EP [emergency checklist]?\n\nLobach realized that in her haste to resolve the issue, she’d skipped a preliminary step: pulling out a document called the flight reference card (FRC) and reading the action steps from it directly, rather than relying on memory.\n\nEaves: Yup. So, I mean, that’s the whole point of the FRC cards, right, is to get us away from doing those things automatically … ’cause we end up killing ourselves because we do something without confirming and verifying …\n\nLobach: Okay, thank you, yeah, you’re absolutely right. I sometimes forget that.\n\nSoon after, Lobach complained of lightheadedness.\n\nLobach: I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling a little dizzy, like, looking down and around with the winds or whatever it is, but not too bad.\n\nEaves: Roger. It is definitely windy. But a beautiful night other than that.\n\nThey were now at their maximum distance to the north from their home airfield at Fort Davison. To get back, they could either return the way they came, flying south and then east, or go the other way around Dulles and Reagan by flying east and then south. Doing the latter would necessitate cutting through the busiest part of the whole Washington airspace, using the river routes that thread between Reagan National Airport and the National Mall.\n\nThat’s what Eaves chose to do. As they were turning east, Lobach decided that she was ready to fly the helicopter.\n\nLobach: Would you be up for me flying for a little while?\n\nEaves: Yup, by all means, ma’am.\n\nTheir next landing spot was a helipad located at the Federal Support Center, an underground facility located at a former Nike missile-launch site in Olney, Maryland. As they drew near, Eaves prepped Lobach for their arrival. As usual, they would fly to a pre-chosen waypoint, known as a release point (RP), then decelerate and descend to a touchdown in the landing zone. Now that the wind was at their back, it was pushing them to a higher groundspeed than their airspeed, meaning that they had less time to plan and react as they maneuvered for landing.\n\nEaves: All right, you’re 1.4 [kilometers] to your RP.\n\nLobach: Okay. Slow down, come down a bit. Wow, that’s wild! I’m slowing down and still at a hundred knots ground.\n\nEaves: 0.7 [kilometers]. What’s your RP?\n\nLobach: Um, I’m sorry — what do you mean, “What was it?”\n\nEaves: All right, what am I looking for on the ground?\n\nLobach: Um, I can’t remember, I have to look at my notes.\n\nEaves told her not to worry about her notes, which told her how to visually identify their landing spot, and instead to simply follow her navigational instruments, which had been programmed with the waypoint’s coordinates.\n\nAs they descended, Eaves and O’Hara called out items on the pre-landing checklist. Lobach commented that she could feel the strong, gusty wind pushing on the left side of the aircraft. Both she and Eaves were scanning ahead, looking for the helipad amid the trees and buildings below them. Eaves spotted it first, then Lobach. But as she maneuvered to come in for a landing to the north, she lost track of it.\n\nEaves: Remember, there is a fence on the north side of this pad.\n\nLobach: Yeah. Thank you … probably still coming in a little too fast. Not so bad. See that big tree on the right? Am I clear of that?\n\nSuddenly, the landing was not looking so good, and Eaves told her to abort.\n\nEaves: Go around! Go around! Go around!\n\nLobach added power and climbed away from the terrain. As she did, building airspeed, she put the helicopter into a banked turn.\n\nEaves: Are you going — which way are you going, ma’am?\n\nLobach: I was going to go right, sorry, do you want me to go left?\n\nEaves: I think it would probably be better, because you’re turning into the wind, right?\n\nThe idea of a go-around is to climb in order to come around and try landing again, but Lobach was starting to feel sketched out.\n\nLobach: I’m not sure I’m, I’m —\n\nLobach: This doesn’t feel right.\n\nEaves: Yup. You’re good. Feels like you’re getting your ass kicked with some wind to the left, right?\n\nEaves: So go ahead and start your approach.\n\nEaves coached her to add power and get the aircraft back in position to try landing again.\n\nLobach: Yeah, I — I’m not comfortable landing there.\n\nLobach: I’m clearing out. I probably could, but — it’s handling funny.\n\nEaves: All right. Mind if I give it a shot?\n\nEaves took the controls and landed the helicopter. On the ground, he talked her through how to handle the tricky winds and offered her a chance to try again.\n\nLobach: Yeah, honestly — I, uh, when we got to the … at that point, that’s probably, like, where I was like, Yeah, I don’t want to do this, ’cause I can’t really see it, like maybe I need to be higher in my chair or something, but I kind of lost any … Yeah, I’m good with the demonstration.\n\nEaves had no objections, and they decided to head back to base. By failing to complete the maneuver as requested, Lobach had effectively failed the check ride. Once back at their home base, Eaves would have to give her a rating of “unsatisfactory,” and Lobach would be put on training status until she was able to demonstrate the necessary proficiency.\n\nBut as they continued their mission, neither mentioned that fact.\n\nTheir course south took them across the wealthy Maryland suburbs of Bethesda and Cabin John, passing over golf courses, nature preserves, and tracts of expensive homes as they headed for the Potomac.\n\nFour minutes after takeoff, perhaps to show that she was not intimidated by the aircraft, Lobach again asked to take the controls. She would have them for the rest of the flight.\n\nPilots who are rusty or lack experience do not have the muscle memory that more skilled pilots possess. When too much information is flooding in at once, they are unable to process it all and become what psychologists call “task saturated.” Among aviators, the condition is known as being “behind the plane.” In this state pilots, are unable to plan ahead to anticipate problems. They respond reactively or simply miss cues altogether. They are not, in other words, fully in control of the aircraft.\n\nReaching the Potomac again at Cabin John, she was too high — 1,400 feet instead of the max altitude of 1,300 — and turned right instead of left, nearly putting the helicopter into forbidden airspace. Rather than taking control of the aircraft back from her, Eaves gently teased her. She pulled a 180, descending as she entered Route 1, a flight corridor along the Potomac’s northern shore.\n\nYou could think of these D.C. helicopter routes as tunnels through the otherwise forbidden airspace. They have a defined ceiling that gets lower and lower as you get closer to the center of the city but no defined lateral boundaries; instead, pilots are instructed to follow the bank of the river. That may seem a little vague, but pilots understand how to do it.\n\n“When I flew those routes, especially at night, I always flew them right on the bank,” says Tim Lilley, a former Army pilot who operated Black Hawks in the D.C. metro area. “One of the reasons is it’s very much easier to tell if you’re gaining or losing altitude, looking at trees and rocks and whatever is on the bank, as opposed to looking at water. If you’re looking at water, there’s no contrast, so you don’t know if you’re climbing or descending unless you look at your instruments. It’s a very bad idea to fly just flat over water at 200 feet, because you’re going to have to spend a lot of time looking inside to make sure you’re at the right altitude. You could very quickly lose 200 feet and end up in the drink.”\n\nAs she flew down the river, Lobach was clearly struggling to stay in control of the aircraft. Eaves nudged her to keep the helicopter in trim and to find the correct altitude.\n\nAt 8:43, as they passed one of the most sensitive and restricted airspaces in the world — the vice-president’s residence at the Naval Observatory — Lobach again complained about the turbulence.\n\nLobach: Getting choppy close to the ground.\n\nEaves: Oh yeah, down low it’s definitely gonna get choppy.\n\nLobach: Yeah. We’re at 300 [feet altitude].\n\nThat was not correct, as Eaves indirectly reminded her.\n\nLobach descended, but the ceiling of the corridor was decreasing as well, so she needed to come down further still.\n\nEaves: All right, there’s 300 for 200.\n\nBut she was not at 200 feet. As she passed the Lincoln Memorial, she was above 300 feet and, in fact, had begun climbing. She had also let the aircraft get out of trim, so that the helicopter was flying somewhat sideways to the wind. Novice pilots who are fixated on one of the numerous aspects of their flight — altitude, location, speed, communication with air-traffic control — can easily lose track of the trim. But it’s an important part of good airmanship, especially during turns.\n\nSouth of the Lincoln Memorial, the helicopter route bends east to cross the Tidal Basin and follows a side branch, the Washington Channel, which is occupied by a small marina. Staying on track required a sharp turn to the left.\n\nEaves: Lots of right pedal, ma’am.\n\nEaves: There we go, now we can make the turn.\n\nHe noticed that, in the process of getting the helicopter to fly straight, she had lost track of her altitude and gotten too high again.\n\nEaves: You’re at 300 feet. Come down for me.\n\nLobach stopped climbing and brought the helicopter into a sharp, short descent, but still remained above the route ceiling.\n\nAs PAT 25 was working its way southeast along Route 1, a regional jet inbound from Wichita was coming up the river from the south, heading for runway 33 at Reagan. Operated by a subsidiary of American Airlines, PSA Airlines flight 5342 was a Bombardier CRJ700 with four crewmembers and 60 passengers, including a group of teenage figure skaters, coaches, and parents returning from the national figure-skating championships.\n\nPAT 25’s path along the east bank of the Potomac would take it right under the designated flight path for jets landing on runway 33. Technically, if neither the helicopter nor the plane deviated from its assigned route, they would pass each other safely, but the margin was so small — just 75 feet at the point of closest approach — that the air-traffic controller at Reagan’s tower called PAT 25 to alert it.\n\nReagan Tower: PAT 25, traffic just south of Wilson Bridge is a CRJ at 1,200 feet for runway 33.\n\nThe primary job of an air-traffic controller is to keep aircraft from colliding. Given that two aircraft on the controller’s screen were now on a converging course, it was crucial to ensure that their paths did not intersect. A commonly used option was to hold southbound helicopter traffic at Hains Point, where the Washington Channel rejoins the main channel of the Potomac, until the landing plane had passed. Instead, Eaves assured the tower that he could see the incoming flight and asked for permission to stay clear of it under his own cognizance.\n\nEaves: PAT 25 has the traffic in sight. Request visual separation.\n\nReagan Tower: Separation approved.\n\nEaves did not have PSA 5342 in sight. As he looked to the south, the airliner would have appeared as one of a string of bright-white dots strung above the horizon. Some commentators have speculated that Eaves had another aircraft in sight, which he mistakenly believed to be PSA 5342. But it may have been that he didn’t have any aircraft in sight at all. During an interview with NTSB investigators, Army Chief Warrant Officer David Van Vechten testified that it was common practice for pilots in the 12th Aviation Battalion to say that they had the traffic in sight even when they didn’t, so that the tower would give them the visual separation clearance. “I’ve done that,” Van Vechten said. “I know if I don’t say it, I may have to hold.”\n\nAs they approached Hains Point, Eaves noted that the wind was pushing them, from behind and from the side, toward the eastern bank. To stay on course, Lobach would have to counteract that push by angling the helicopter to the right.\n\nLobach: Crabbing … better not to fight the wind. Right pedal.\n\nFifty seconds later, PAT 25 rejoined the main channel of the Potomac at Hains Point. The lights of Reagan Airport lay a half mile to the right. The PSA flight was a mile and a half away, dead ahead, on a converging course, and closing at a speed of more than 200 mph.\n\nIn the aftermath of the crash, investigators focused on the staffing level at the Reagan tower, concerned that an overburdened controller had mistakenly allowed the aircraft to converge, but the transcript shows that the close approach of the jet and the helicopter was front-of-mind for him. As the distance between the aircraft closed, he checked in with the Black Hawk.\n\nReagan Tower: PAT 25, you have the CRJ in sight? PAT 25 pass behind the CRJ.\n\nEaves: PAT 25 has aircraft in sight. Request visual separation.\n\nReagan Tower: Visual separation.\n\nFlying south from Hains Point, Lobach should have eased to the left to join the bank of the Potomac. Instead, she headed straight down the center of the river. Out here over the water, the river was just a black void. The only way to gauge how high she was was to look at the altimeter inside the cockpit. But that meant not looking outside at what was in front of her.\n\nLikely, she was still task saturated: trying to keep the helicopter at the right altitude, and along the right path, while wrestling with turbulence and a gusty wind that was pushing her toward the river bank on her left, all while wearing night-vision goggles that blocked her peripheral vision and overwhelmed her eyes with too much light. In this environment, with all the lights of the city around her, it would actually have been much easier to see with the goggles off, but that would have defeated the purpose of the mission.\n\nIn a word, Lobach was flailing. Eaves was as well, too distracted by his runaway student pilot to pay attention to what was happening outside the cockpit.\n\nEaves: All right, kinda come left for me, ma’am. I think that’s why he’s asking.\n\nLobach did not turn toward the eastern bank.\n\nAt 8:47:57.7, the helicopter’s black box recorded Lobach making a “sound similar to mumbling.”\n\nThe Blackhawk helicopter was flying at an altitude of 278 feet and a speed of 120 mph. It was both too far out from the riverbank and too high, which put it squarely in the path of the CRJ descending at 128 mph.\n\nOne second before impact, the CRJ’s flight crew tried to pull the airplane up. The helicopter’s main rotor hit the nose and engines of the airliner, triggering a fireball, and the commingled wreckage fell vertically into the Potomac River. The impact would have been unsurvivable for anyone onboard.\n\nWhat Lobach faced on the final night of her life was a mission that was far beyond her skill level. She was a low-proficiency pilot with a low aptitude for flying, one who didn’t fly regularly in an operational role and had no intention of flying after leaving the service. She was operating a helicopter that was older, less automated, and more challenging than what she’d trained on. Her instructor pilot had been warned to keep a tight rein on her during the flight but had failed to do so.\n\nAs the pilot in command, Eaves bears personal responsibility for what happened. But responsibility was not his alone. The crash was also a product of a dysfunctional system. For years, the Army air-accident rate has been climbing, as aviators complain that they are not being given enough flight time to maintain adequate levels of skill.\n\n“Across a lot of Army aviation units … what we’re seeing is that composite cockpit time is steadily going down and down and down,” said NTSB Chairman Jennifer Homendy during a hearing into the accident. “Five years ago, we would have thousands of hours cockpit. Now, we have hundreds and hundreds of hours cockpit … Experience across aviation formations is steadily decreasing.”\n\nIt’s striking that this decrease is even being felt at the 12th Aviation Battalion, whose mission is to transport the legislators who make Defense spending decisions and the Pentagon brass who implement those decisions. You’d think that they’d want their lives entrusted to only the most skilled pilots. The fate of PAT 25 shows that the unit can’t even be trusted to transport itself. “At her flight time of 460-something hours, if you’re not flying once a week, you are not proficient,” says Tim Lilley, the former Army Black Hawk pilot. “Certainly not proficient enough to fly high-ranking officials.” Yet the Army considered Lobach qualified to do just that.\n\nAfter Lilley retired from the military, he became an airline pilot, and eventually his son Samuel became an airline pilot, too. Samuel Lilley was serving as the first officer of PSA 5342 on the night of January 29, 2025. In the year since his death Tim has been on a mission to change the Army’s approach so that tragedies like this don’t happen again.\n\n“It was an embarrassment to Army aviation,” he says. “And you know, I still proudly wear my Army wings. But there’s a lot of things that have to be addressed.”\n\nOne thing he’d like to see happen is for the Army to establish a rigorous safety-reporting system of the kind that’s standard in commercial aviation. Another is to make sure that pilots get enough flying time to be proficient, even if that means taking staff officers off the roster entirely. “They have 14,000 active pilots. And I said to the Army Chief of Staff, ‘Wouldn’t you rather have 11,000 proficient pilots, rather than 14,000 pilots that are barely getting minimums?’”\n\nHe knows that it will be a hard journey to get there. Cultures don’t change easily. But a son’s death is a powerful motivator. As for Eaves and Lobach, he doesn’t blame them for his son’s death. He thinks that Lobach could have become a good pilot if they gave her another thousand hours of flying time. Instead, the Army withheld from her the training and flight time that she needed to fly safely and then required her to go fly anyway on a mission that was as ill-conceived as it was poorly executed.\n\n“There was no reason for them to be there,” he says. “This was a bad idea. A bad plan from the get-go.”",

    "description": "how we used math, reinforcement learning, and social engineering to build a universal rhythm game cheat, climb to top 20 worldwide, and get banned without ever being detected.",
    "fullText": "using math and reinforcement learning, we built a cheat that works on literally every VSRG - osu!mania, etterna, quaver, stepmania, you name it. no game-specific code. just math and a trained model that learned to read scrolling notes and output perfectly timed keystrokes.\n\nit worked too well. top 20 worldwide on osu!, then banned. even funnier than that, they still had no proof the scores were cheated, and could only ban us for multi-accounting suspicions.\n\nthe best part? we social-engineered our way into the community so hard that top 100 players were vouching for us being legit. people analyzed our replays and said “yeah this looks human.” whilst we never even pressed a single key.\n\nthis is the story of how we spent a weekend building something we probably shouldn’t have, got way better results than we expected, and confirmed that the hardest part of cheating isn’t fooling the software, it’s fooling the people.\n\nit started as a joke. “what if we made a bot that could play osu!mania?” turned into “what if it worked on every rhythm game?” which turned into “what if we actually tried to rank?” which turned into high ranked accounts in every rhythm game, a top 20 global ranking, friendships with players who had no idea they were befriending a python script, and eventually a ban that proved we’d done our job almost too well.\n\nwe’re not releasing the code. we’re not here to help you cheat. we’re here because these were really interesting technical and sociological problems we’ve worked on, and the intersection of math, machine learning, reverse engineering, and straight-up social engineering is too good not to document.\n\nalso, statute of limitations on internet drama is like 6 months… right?\n\nVSRG stands for Vertical Scrolling Rhythm Game. if you’ve ever played guitar hero, dance dance revolution, or beatmania, then you’ve played a VSRG. notes fall from the top of the screen, you press the corresponding key when they hit the bottom. simple.\n\nthe competitive scene is… not simple.\n\ngames like osu!mania, etterna, quaver, and stepmania have global leaderboards, ranked play, and communities that take timing accuracy and legitimacy very seriously. we’re talking millisecond-level precision. the difference between a “marvelous” and a “perfect” hit can be 16ms. the difference between top 100 and top 1000 is consistency across thousands of notes.\n\nhere’s the thing that made this project possible: every VSRG is fundamentally the same problem.\n\nnotes scroll down. you press keys. the visual style changes. between games, it can be stylized as arrows, circles, bars, whatever… but the underlying mechanic is identical! timing windows vary, scoring formulas differ, but the core loop is:\n\nwhich means if you can solve this problem once, mathematically, you can solve it for every game in the genre.\n\nthis seems like an easy problem to solve.. right? well, not exactly.\n\n“just OCR the screen and press keys lol”\n\ntechnically, this fails for a few reasons:\n\nwe tried this first. it was bad. like, worse than average bad.\n\nbut here’s the thing most people don’t realize: even if your bot plays perfectly, you still lose.\n\nosu! has actual anti-cheat software, sure. (albeit old, you can still see some of vmfunc and pushfq’s research on their ac here) but the real threat isn’t their anti-cheat really, it’s the community.\n\never heard of r/osureport? it’s a subreddit dedicated entirely to hunting cheaters. thousands of players spending their free time analyzing replays, tracking improvement curves, comparing timing distributions, and writing detailed reports on anyone who looks suspicious.\n\nthey have spreadsheets. they have bots that automate report tracking. they categorize cheats by type: relax hacks, timewarp, macros, aim assist, multi-account, and whatnot. they track ban statuses. it’s genuinely impressive how organized they are at ruining cheaters’ days.\n\nand it’s not just reddit. set a good or a top score on a ranked map and you’ll have people in your DMs within hours. “hey nice score, can you stream it?” “your UR is crazy consistent, what’s your setup?” “I noticed your improvement curve is insane, how long have you been playing?”\n\nevery replay is public. every score can be downloaded and frame-by-frame analyzed. people will literally overlay your cursor movements on top of known cheaters to look for patterns. they’ll run statistical analysis on your hit timing distributions. they’ll compare your offline vs online performance.\n\nthe osu! community has mass-reported accounts into bans purely based on “this doesn’t feel right.” no concrete proof, just collective suspicion. and staff often listens.\n\nso the real challenge isn’t just “play the notes correctly.” it’s:\n\nthis is why most cheats get caught. not because the software detected them but because a bored 16 year old with too much free time noticed something was off. or because you beat the score of another top player who took the piss.\n\nso how do we even achieve this?\n\nthe notes are deterministic. the chart is the chart. if you know the scroll speed and the current timestamp, you can mathematically derive where every note will be at any moment.\n\nthis is just calculus. and a little signal processing.\n\nbut wait… remember the human problem? pure math gives you perfect inputs. perfect inputs get you banned in 24 hours.\n\nhere’s where it gets interesting. osu! lets you download replays. any replay. from anyone. including the top 50 players in the world.\n\nso we did exactly that. we scraped thousands of replays from top 100 players across different skill brackets. not just their best plays, their mediocre ones too. the ones where they choked. the ones where they were warming up. the ones at 3am when they were using different setups and keyboards.\n\nfrom each replay, we extracted:\n\nturns out humans are incredibly consistent in their inconsistency. top players don’t just have better accuracy but they actually have signature error patterns. you shouldn’t interpret their timing distributions as random noise, they’re actually shaped by muscle memory, fatigue, and playstyle.\n\nso in theory, if you can mimick that, while also mimicking a natural pattern of improving after playing a chart over and over again, or choking every now and then, you’re basically just a human to the external eye.\n\nwe now had a dataset of what “legitimate top player” actually looks like, statistically. the goal wasn’t to play perfectly but it was to play exactly like a human would if that human had god-tier reflexes.\n\nalright, let’s get into the actual implementation.\n\nwe sample single pixels at the hit zone for each column. for a 4-key layout, that’s 4 regions:\n\neach frame, we capture these 1x1 pixel regions and check if a note is present via color matching:\n\nsimple color thresholding with a tolerance of ~3. works surprisingly well across different skins as long as you calibrate the target colors.\n\nhere’s where it gets interesting. we track KPS (keys per second) in real-time and use it to dynamically adjust timing variance:\n\nhumans get less consistent when playing faster. so we scale deviance with KPS:\n\nat low KPS (slow sections), timing is tight and consistent. at high KPS (dense streams), variance increases. this matches how real players behave, obviously you can’t maintain perfect consistency at 20+ KPS.\n\nlong notes get different treatment though, smaller deviance on press/release because humans are actually more consistent with holds:\n\npure math gets you accuracy. but leaderboards also care about:\n\nuniform random distribution doesn’t look human. humans have biased error distributions, they tend to hit slightly early or slightly late depending on playstyle, and errors cluster in patterns.\n\nwe had thousands of replays. we had a working bot. now we needed to make them talk to each other.\n\nwe framed this as a policy optimization problem. the agent’s job, given a note timing, had to output a delay that maximizes “human-likeness” while staying within scoring windows.\n\nthe perfection_penalty was crucial. without it, the agent learned to hit perfect timings every time, which is exactly what gets you reported.\n\nfor each replay in our dataset, we extracted:\n\nthis gave us ~2 million training samples across different skill levels, playstyles, and song difficulties.\n\nmodel wise it’s nothing fancy, a small feedforward network (3 hidden layers, 128 units each) that outputs mean and variance for a gaussian distribution. we sample from that distribution to get the actual delay.\n\ntrained with PPO for ~500k steps. the loss curves were boring (good sign) and the final policy produced timing distributions that were statistically indistinguishable from our reference players.\n\nwe generated 1000 synthetic replays and compared their timing distributions against real replays using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. p-values > 0.05 for all columns and KPS brackets.\n\nin english (for the non math nerds out there) if you looked at a histogram of our bot’s timing errors vs a real player’s timing errors, you couldn’t tell them apart.\n\nhere’s what it looks like in action:\n\ngame 1 uses arrow skins. game 2 uses circles. game 3 uses bars. game 4 uses rectangles. who cares?\n\nthe core engine doesn’t change. the humanizer doesn’t change. the only thing that changes per-game is:\n\nwe built a simple config system. point it at a new game, calibrate the detection regions, tweak the timing parameters, done. same bot, different skin.\n\ntested on: osu!mania, etterna, quaver, stepmania, malody, even roblox, and a few others we probably shouldn’t name. worked on all of them.\n\nwith a working bot and a humanizer that passed statistical tests, it was time to see how far we could push it.\n\nwe spent around ~5000 dollars on accounts on various games, osu!, etterna, quaver, roblox, you name it.\n\nthe last one was the hardest. we couldn’t just jump from unranked to top 100 in a week. so we tried two different routes.\n\nthe first one, scripting a fake improvement curve start with easier maps, gradually increase difficulty, occasionally plateau, sometimes regress slightly. just like a real player learning the game.\n\nthe second one, directly jumping to insane ranks and using our profiles in other games to prove our legitimacy and claim that we came from other games, since skills are transferrable.\n\nwe even made the bot “practice” maps. play the same song multiple times with slightly improving scores each time. leave realistic gaps between sessions. take breaks on weekends.\n\nfirst it was top 10,000. then top 5,000. then top 1,000. every milestone felt surreal. we were watching a program outperform thousands of real humans who had spent years developing their skills.\n\nat this point on some games like roblox, people started noticing. “what’s your practice routine” “can you stream sometime”\n\nwe couldn’t stream, obviously. so we made excuses. bad internet. anxiety. broken webcam. the community bought it. they had no reason not to.\n\nwe were in the leaderboards next to players we’d watched for years. players whose replays we’d scraped to train our bot were now competing against that same bot. the irony wasn’t lost on us lol\n\ntop 100 players vouched for us. people analyzed our replays frame-by-frame and said “yeah i mean this looks legit”. at some point on quaver someone even invited us to a tournament. we politely declined (scheduling conflicts, yk…)\n\nwe were living a double life. and honestly? it was kind of exhausting.\n\nhere’s the thing: we didn’t really get caught. not in the way you’d expect.\n\nout of all the accounts across all the games, only two osu! accounts got banned. the rest? still standing. etterna, quaver, the roblox games? all still up. we’ll be manually deleting them now that this post is out, since that was always the plan once the experiment was over.\n\nso what happened with those two osu! accounts?\n\nwe got cocky. we started sniping top players. taking their #1s on maps they cared about. that’s when people started paying attention.\n\nthe thing is, we had a cover story ready: “i’m coming from etterna/quaver, just switched to osu!mania.” this is actually a legitimate thing that happens, as players migrate between VSRGs all the time, and their skills transfer. it’s not suspicious to be good at osu!mania if you’ve been grinding etterna for years.\n\nwe even got top players to vouch for us. showed them our replays, chatted with them about technique, talked about our “background” in other games. claimed we were specifically good at X or Y playstyle, some analyzed our scores and said “yeah this tracks, the skillset transfers”… social engineering at its finest.\n\nsince both of us actually knew how to play VSRGs, we could handle conversations with top players just fine without struggling to use terminology or knowing things only good players would know.\n\nand here’s our strongest argument: we couldn’t possibly be cheating in EVERY game.\n\nthe community’s logic was simple, there are no publicly available cheats that work across osu!, etterna, quaver, AND roblox rhythm games. surely if someone was cheating, they’d only be cheating in one game? the idea of a universal VSRG cheat seemed absurd. “there’s no way someone has a cheat for all of them”\n\nturns out we did. but nobody believed that was even possible.\n\nthe irony of this screenshot still kills us. “i just so happen to have a cheat that works on every game including quaver etterna osu roblox” said sarcastically, as if that’s an absurd claim. reader, it was not absurd. we had exactly that.\n\nbut here’s the thing about sniping top players: they get salty. and salty players report. a lot.\n\nthe anti-cheat never flagged us. our replays passed every statistical test the community threw at them. the timing distributions looked human. the persona was solid.\n\nwhat got us was the cockiness which led to a report. not with evidence (as all evidence they provided got disproven by other top players, including graphs!), just “this doesn’t feel right” from enough people that staff had to do something.\n\nthe official ban reason? multi-accounting and stolen account suspicion. not cheating. they couldn’t prove cheating because, statistically, there was nothing to prove. our replays were indistinguishable from human replays.\n\nthey knew something was off. too good, too fast, too many people complaining. but they couldn’t prove what.\n\nin the end, the cheat was never detected. the human behind it was just too annoying.\n\nand honestly? that felt like a win.\n\nrhythm games are a solved problem - mathematically, there’s nothing stopping a bot from achieving perfect play. the timing is deterministic, the inputs are simple.\n\nthe hard part is the human problem - anti-cheat software is easy to bypass. the community is not. thousands of players actively hunting for cheaters is a more effective deterrent than any automated system.\n\nstatistical humanization is surprisingly effective - with enough training data and the right model, you can generate behavior that’s indistinguishable from human behavior. scary implications beyond rhythm games.\n\nsocial engineering is underrated - half our success came from building a believable persona in various games. the technical cheat was good, but the social cover was what let us climb for months.\n\nwe spent way too much time on this - could’ve learned a real skill. instead we learned how to fake one. worth it? probably not. fun? absolutely.\n\nwe’re not releasing code and we’re not here to help people cheat.\n\nthis is documentation of an interesting technical problem! the intersection of signal processing, reinforcement learning, game hacking, and social engineering.\n\nthe rhythm game community will probably hate this post. fair honestly. and we’re sorry. but the problems we solved here have applications beyond cheating at video games: fraud detection, bot detection, behavioral biometrics, and much more! understanding how to fake human behavior helps you understand how to detect fake human behavior.\n\nalso we’re already banned and are going to delete all our other accounts used for testing. what are they gonna do, ban us again?\n\nwe built something that shouldn’t work as well as it did. we climbed higher than we expected. we made friends who weren’t real and rivals who didn’t know they were competing against code.\n\nin the end, we got caught not because the cheat failed, but because humans are better at detecting humans than software ever will be. the bot was perfect. the person it was pretending to be wasn’t convincing enough.\n\nthere’s probably a lesson in there somewhere.\n\nthanks for reading. don’t cheat at video games. it’s not worth it.\n\nbut if you’re going to do it anyway, at least do your own research, write your own stuff, and make it interesting",

    "fullText": "Visibility and context on the threats that matter most.\n\nThis week Google and partners took action to disrupt what we believe is one of the largest residential proxy networks in the world, the IPIDEA proxy network. IPIDEA’s proxy infrastructure is a little-known component of the digital ecosystem leveraged by a wide array of bad actors.\n\nThis disruption, led by Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) in partnership with other teams, included three main actions:\n\nTook legal action to take down domains used to control devices and proxy traffic through them.\n\nShared technical intelligence on discovered IPIDEA software development kits (SDKs) and proxy software with platform providers, law enforcement, and research firms to help drive ecosystem-wide awareness and enforcement. These SDKs, which are offered to developers across multiple mobile and desktop platforms, surreptitiously enroll user devices into the IPIDEA network. Driving collective enforcement against these SDKs helps protect users across the digital ecosystem and restricts the network's ability to expand.\n\nThese efforts to help keep the broader digital ecosystem safe supplement the protections we have to safeguard Android users on certified devices. We ensured Google Play Protect, Android’s built-in security protection, automatically warns users and removes applications known to incorporate IPIDEA SDKs, and blocks any future install attempts.\n\nWe believe our actions have caused significant degradation of IPIDEA’s proxy network and business operations, reducing the available pool of devices for the proxy operators by millions. Because proxy operators share pools of devices using reseller agreements, we believe these actions may have downstream impact across affiliated entities.\n\nIn contrast to other types of proxies, residential proxy networks sell the ability to route traffic through IP addresses owned by internet service providers (ISPs) and used to provide service to residential or small business customers. By routing traffic through an array of consumer devices all over the world, attackers can mask their malicious activity by hijacking these IP addresses. This generates significant challenges for network defenders to detect and block malicious activities.\n\nA robust residential proxy network requires the control of millions of residential IP addresses to sell to customers for use. IP addresses in countries such as the US, Canada, and Europe are considered especially desirable. To do this, residential proxy network operators need code running on consumer devices to enroll them into the network as exit nodes. These devices are either pre-loaded with proxy software or are joined to the proxy network when users unknowingly download trojanized applications with embedded proxy code. Some users may knowingly install this software on their devices, lured by the promise of “monetizing” their spare bandwidth. When the device is joined to the proxy network, the proxy provider sells access to the infected device’s network bandwidth (and use of its IP address) to their customers.\n\nWhile operators of residential proxies often extol the privacy and freedom of expression benefits of residential proxies, Google Threat Intelligence Group’s (GTIG) research shows that these proxies are overwhelmingly misused by bad actors. IPIDEA has become notorious for its role in facilitating several botnets: its software development kits played a key role in adding devices to the botnets, and its proxy software was then used by bad actors to control them. This includes the BadBox2.0 botnet we took legal action against last year, and the Aisuru and Kimwolf botnets more recently. We also observe IPIDEA being leveraged by a vast array of espionage, crime, and information operations threat actors. In a single seven day period in January 2026, GTIG observed over 550 individual threat groups that we track utilizing IP addresses tracked as IPIDEA exit nodes to obfuscate their activities, including groups from China, DPRK, Iran and Russia. The activities included access to victim SaaS environments, on-premises infrastructure, and password spray attacks. Our research has found significant overlaps between residential proxy network exit nodes, likely because of reseller and partnership agreements, making definitive quantification and attribution challenging.\n\nIn addition, residential proxies pose a risk to the consumers whose devices are joined to the proxy network as exit nodes. These users knowingly or unknowingly provide their IP address and device as a launchpad for hacking and other unauthorized activities, potentially causing them to be flagged as suspicious or blocked by providers. Proxy applications also introduce security vulnerabilities to consumers’ devices and home networks. When a user’s device becomes an exit node, network traffic that they do not control will pass through their device. This means bad actors can access a user’s private devices on the same network, effectively exposing security vulnerabilities to the internet. GTIG’s analysis of these applications confirmed that IPIDEA proxy did not solely route traffic through the exit node device, they also sent traffic to the device, in order to compromise it. While proxy providers may claim ignorance or close these security gaps when notified, enforcement and verification is challenging given intentionally murky ownership structures, reseller agreements, and diversity of applications.\n\nOur analysis of residential proxy networks found that many well-known residential proxy brands are not only related but are controlled by the actors behind IPIDEA. This includes the following ostensibly independent proxy and VPN brands:\n\nCherry Proxy (cherryproxy\\.com)\n\nThe same actors that control these brands also control several domains related to Software Development Kits (SDKs) for residential proxies. These SDKs are not meant to be installed or executed as standalone applications, rather they are meant to be embedded into existing applications. The operators market these kits as ways for developers to monetize their applications, and offer Android, Windows, iOS, and WebOS compatibility. Once developers incorporate these SDKs into their app, they are then paid by IPIDEA usually on a per-download basis.\n\nFigure 1: Advertising from PacketSDK, part of the IPIDEA proxy network\n\nOnce the SDK is embedded into an application, it will turn the device it is running on into an exit node for the proxy network in addition to providing whatever the primary functionality of the application was. These SDKs are the key to any residential proxy network—the software they get embedded into provides the network operators with the millions of devices they need to maintain a healthy residential proxy network.\n\nWhile many residential proxy providers state that they source their IP addresses ethically, our analysis shows these claims are often incorrect or overstated. Many of the malicious applications we analyzed in our investigation did not disclose that they enrolled devices into the IPIDEA proxy network. Researchers have previously found uncertified and off-brand Android Open Source Project devices, such as television set top boxes, with hidden residential proxy payloads.\n\nThe following SDKs are controlled by the same actors that control the IPIDEA proxy network:\n\nWe performed static and dynamic analysis on software that had SDK code embedded in it as well as standalone SDK files to identify the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure used to manage proxy exit nodes and route traffic through them. From the analysis we observed that EarnSDK, PacketSDK, CastarSDK, and HexSDK have significant overlaps in their C2 infrastructure as well as code structure.\n\nThe infrastructure model is a two-tier system:\n\nTier One: Upon startup, the device will choose from a set of domains to connect to. The device sends some diagnostic information to the Tier One server and receives back a data payload that includes a set of Tier Two nodes to connect to.\n\nTier Two: The application will communicate directly with an IP address to periodically poll for proxy tasks. When it receives a proxy task it will establish a new dedicated connection to the Tier Two IP address and begin proxying the payloads it receives.\n\nThe device diagnostic information can be sent as HTTP GET query string parameters or in the HTTP POST body, depending on the domain and SDK. The payload sent includes a key parameter, which may be a customer identifier used to determine who gets paid for the device enrollment.\n\nFigure 3: Sample device information send to Tier One server\n\nThe response from the Tier One server includes some timing information as well as the IP addresses of the Tier Two servers that this device should periodically poll for tasking.\n\nFigure 4: Sample response received from the Tier One Server\n\nThe Tier Two servers are sent as connect and proxy pairs. In all analyses the pairs have been IP addresses, not domains. In our analysis, the pairs are the same IP address but different ports. The connect port is used to periodically poll for new proxy tasking. This is performed by sending TCP packets with encoded JSON payloads.\n\nFigure 5: Sample encoded JSON sent to Tier Two connect port\n\nWhen the Tier Two server has traffic to route to the device, it will respond back with the FQDN to proxy traffic to as well as a connection ID.\n\nFigure 6: Sample proxy tasking from the Tier Two server\n\nThe device will then establish a connection to the proxy port of the same Tier Two server and send the connection ID, indicating that it is ready to receive data payloads.\n\nFigure 7: Sample data sent from device to the Tier Two proxy port\n\nThe Tier Two server will then immediately send data payloads to be proxied. The device will extract the TCP data payload, establish a socket connection to the specified FQDN and send the payload, unmodified, to the destination.\n\nThe SDKs each have their own set of Tier One domains. This comes primarily from analysis of standalone SDK files.\n\nhttp://{random}.api-seed.packetsdk\\.xyz\n\nhttp://{random}.api-seed.packetsdk\\.net\n\nhttp://{random}.api-seed.packetsdk\\.io\n\ncfe47df26c8eaf0a7c136b50c703e173\\.com\n\n8b21a945159f23b740c836eb50953818\\.com\n\n31d58c226fc5a0aa976e13ca9ecebcc8\\.com\n\nDownload requests to files from the Hex SDK website redirect to castarsdk\\.com. The SDKs are exactly the same.\n\nThe EarnSDK JAR package for Android has strong overlaps with the other SDK brands analyzed. Earlier published samples contained the Tier One C2 domains:\n\nOf note, these domains were observed as part of the BadBox2.0 botnet and were sinkholed in our earlier litigation. Pivoting off these domains and other signatures, we identified some additional domains used as Tier One C2 domains:\n\nOur analysis of various malware samples and the SDKs found a single shared pool of Tier Two servers. As of this writing there were approximately 7,400 Tier Two servers. The number of Tier Two nodes changes on a daily basis, consistent with a demand-based scaling system. They are hosted in locations around the globe, including the US. This indicates that despite different brand names and Tier One domains, the different SDKs in fact manage devices and proxy traffic through the same infrastructure.\n\nThe IPIDEA actors also control domains that offer free Virtual Private Network services. While the applications do seem to provide VPN functionality, they also join the device to the IPIDEA proxy network as an exit node by incorporating Hex or Packet SDK. This is done without clear disclosures to the end user, nor is it the primary function of the application.\n\nWe identified a total of 3,075 unique Windows PE file hashes where dynamic analysis recorded a DNS request to at least one Tier One domain. A number of these hashes were for the monetized proxy exit node software, PacketShare. Our analysis also uncovered applications masquerading as OneDriveSync and Windows Update. These trojanized Windows applications were not distributed directly by the IPIDEA actors.\n\nWe identified over 600 applications across multiple download sources with code connecting to Tier One C2 domains. These apps were largely benign in function (e.g., utilities, games, and content) but utilized monetization SDKs that enabled IPIDEA proxy behavior.\n\nThis week we took a number of steps designed to comprehensively dismantle as much of IPIDEA’s infrastructure as possible.\n\nWe took legal action to take down the C2 domains used by bad actors to control devices and proxy traffic. This protects consumer devices and home networks by disrupting the infrastructure at the source.\n\nTo safeguard the Android ecosystem, we enforced our platform policies against trojanizing software, ensuring Google Play Protect on certified Android devices with Google Play services automatically warns users and removes applications known to incorporate IPIDEA software development kits (SDKs), and blocks any future install attempts.\n\nWe took legal action to take down the domains used to market IPIDEA’s products, including proxy software and software development kits, across their various brands.\n\nWe’ve shared our findings with industry partners to enable them to take action as well. We’ve worked closely with other firms, including Spur and Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs to understand the scope and extent of residential proxy networks and the bad behavior they often enable. We partnered with Cloudflare to disrupt IPIDEA’s domain resolution, impacting their ability to command and control infected devices and market their products.\n\nWhile we believe our actions have seriously impacted one of the largest residential proxy providers, this industry appears to be rapidly expanding, and there are significant overlaps across providers. As our investigation shows, the residential proxy market has become a \"gray market\" that thrives on deception—hijacking consumer bandwidth to provide cover for global espionage and cybercrime. More must be done to address the risks of these technologies.\n\nResidential proxies are an understudied area of risk for consumers, and more can be done to raise awareness. Consumers should be extremely wary of applications that offer payment in exchange for \"unused bandwidth\" or \"sharing your internet.\" These applications are primary ways for illicit proxy networks to grow, and could open security vulnerabilities on the device’s home network. We urge users to stick to official app stores, review permissions for third-party VPNs and proxies, and ensure built-in security protections like Google Play Protect are active.\n\nConsumers should be careful when purchasing connected devices, such as set top boxes, to make sure they are from reputable manufacturers. For example, to help you confirm whether or not a device is built with the official Android TV OS and Play Protect certified, our Android TV website provides the most up-to-date list of partners. You can also take these steps to check if your Android device is Play Protect certified.\n\nResidential proxy providers have been able to flourish under the guise of legitimate businesses. While some providers may indeed behave ethically and only enroll devices with the clear consent of consumers, any claims of \"ethical sourcing\" must be backed by transparent, auditable proof of user consent. Similarly, app developers have a responsibility to vet the monetization SDKs they integrate.\n\nWe encourage mobile platforms, ISPs, and other tech platforms to continue sharing intelligence and implementing best practices to identify illicit proxy networks and limit their harms.\n\nTo assist the wider community in hunting and identifying activity outlined in this blog post, we have included a comprehensive list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) in a GTI Collection for registered users.\n\n00857cca77b615c369f48ead5f8eb7f3.com\n\n31d58c226fc5a0aa976e13ca9ecebcc8.com\n\n3k7m1n9p4q2r6s8t0v5w2x4y6z8u9.com\n\n7x2k9n4p1q0r5s8t3v6w0y2z4u7b9.com\n\n8b21a945159f23b740c836eb50953818.com\n\na8d3b9e1f5c7024d6e0b7a2c9f1d83e5.com\n\naf4760df2c08896a9638e26e7dd20aae.com\n\nb5e9a2d7f4c8e3b1a0d6f2e9c5b8a7d.com\n\ncfe47df26c8eaf0a7c136b50c703e173.com\n\ne4f8c1b9a2d7e3f6c0b5a8d9e2f1c4d.com\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=69878507/C=HK/L=Hong Kong Island/O=HONGKONG LINGYUN MDT INFOTECH LIMITED/CN=HONGKONG LINGYUN MDT INFOTECH LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/businessCategory=Private Organization/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/serialNumber=2746134/C=HK/L=Wan Chai/O=HONGKONG LINGYUN MDT INFOTECH LIMITED/CN=HONGKONG LINGYUN MDT INFOTECH LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=74092936/C=HK/L=HONG KONG ISLAND/O=FIRENET LIMITED/CN=FIRENET LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=3157599/C=HK/L=Wan Chai/O=FIRENET LIMITED/CN=FIRENET LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=74097562/C=HK/L=Hong Kong Island/O=PRINCE LEGEND LIMITED/CN=PRINCE LEGEND LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=73874246/C=HK/L=Kowloon/O=MARS BROTHERS LIMITED/CN=MARS BROTHERS LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=3135905/C=HK/L=Cheung Sha Wan/O=MARS BROTHERS LIMITED/CN=MARS BROTHERS LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=3222394/C=HK/L=WAN CHAI/O=DATALABS LIMITED/CN=DATALABS LIMITED\n\nPacket SDK package found inside other applications\n\naef34f14456358db91840c416e55acc7d10185ff2beb362ea24697d7cdad321f\n\nApplication with Packet SDK Code\n\nb0726bdd53083968870d0b147b72dad422d6d04f27cd52a7891d038ee83aef5b\n\n2d1891b6d0c158ad7280f0f30f3c9d913960a793c6abcda249f9c76e13014e45\n\n59cbdecfc01eba859d12fbeb48f96fe3fe841ac1aafa6bd38eff92f0dcfd4554\n\nba9b1f4cc2c7f4aeda7a1280bbc901671f4ec3edaa17f1db676e17651e9bff5f\n\n01ac6012d4316b68bb3165ee451f2fcc494e4e37011a73b8cf2680de3364fcf4",

    "description": "Amid growing affordability concerns across the nation, President Trump said he is looking to drive housing prices further up, not down.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON − Amid growing affordability concerns across the nation, President Donald Trump said he is looking to drive housing prices further up, not down.\n\nTrump said at a Jan. 29 Cabinet meeting he wants to make it easier for Americans to buy homes ‒ but not by making housing less expensive. Instead, he suggested lower interest rates he expects from his upcoming pick to lead the Federal Reserve will allow more Americans to buy homes even as housing prices rise.\n\n\"I don't want to drive housing prices down. I want to drive housing prices up for people that own their homes,\" Trump said. \"And they can be assured that's what's going to happen.\"\n\nTrump has been rolling out several policy proposals and actions aimed at addressing affordability and housing as Americans continue to express cost-of-living concerns. That includes a Jan. 20 executive order banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes in a push to expand home ownership. The Trump administration is also purchasing mortgage-backed securities to lower mortgage rates.\n\nYet Trump made clear in his meeting with Cabinet secretaries that greater opportunities to buy homes shouldn't mean lowering costs, even as Americans voice concerns about the price tag to buy a home.\n\n\"Existing housing, people that own their homes, we're going to keep them wealthy,\" Trump said. \"We're going to keep those prices up. We're not going to destroy the value of their homes so that somebody who didn't work very hard can buy a home.\n\n\"We're going to make it easier to buy,\" the president added. \"We're going to get interest rates down. But I want to protect the people who, for the first time in their lives, feel good about themselves. They feel like, you know, that they're wealthy people.\"\n\nHousing prices rose in November 0.6% over the previous month, according to the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency's most recent monthly report, released Jan. 27. The median home price nationally soared to a record $433,000 in November 2025, according to the real estate company Redfin. Zillow projects housing prices to increase by 1.9% in 2026.\n\nHousing prices remain elevated relative to income growth after adjusting for inflation, pushing homeownership out of reach for many Americans. The housing market is considered stagnant amid a national housing shortage, especially at the lower end of the market.\n\nTrump last week said he opposes a plan endorsed by his White House economic team that would allow Americans to use retirement savings from their 401(k) accounts to make down payments on homes.\n\nTrump told his Cabinet he intends to announce his nominee as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve next week. For the past year, Trump has criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for refusing to aggressively lower interest rates as Trump has demanded. Powell's term as Fed chairman ends in May.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.",

    "title": "The Cost of PostgreSQL Arrays",
    "description": "Deep dive into PostgreSQL arrays: why they're document storage in disguise, the TOAST performance trap, GIN vs B-tree indexing, the dangerous ANY() operator, and when junction tables beat arrays.",
    "fullText": "Starting with arrays in PostgreSQL is as simple as declaring a column as integer[], inserting some values, and you are done.\n\nOr building the array on the fly.\n\nThe official documentation provides a good introduction. But beneath this straightforward interface lies a set of more complex properties than most of us realise. Arrays in PostgreSQL are not just \"lists\" in a field. They have their own memory management strategy, their own index logic, and a lot of edge-case scenarios.\n\nAs it goes with boringSQL deep-dives, this article will explore the corners of array functionality that might break your production.\n\nWait? Are we going to talk about JSONB arrays? Not at all. The whole concept of arrays in RDBMSs is actually document storage in disguise.\n\nIn database design, locality ensures faster retrieval times by keeping related data close on physical storage.Whether you use a distinct integer[] type or a JSON list [1, 2, 3], you are making the exact same architectural decision: you are prioritising locality over normalisation.\n\nWhen you store tag_ids in an array, you are embedding related data directly into a row - just like a NoSQL database might embed subdocuments. This is not inherently wrong. Document databases exist for good reasons: they eliminate joins, simplify reads, and map naturally to application objects.\n\nBut PostgreSQL is a relational database. It was designed around the relational model, where:\n\nArrays give you document-model convenience, but you lose relational promises. There are no foreign keys and no ON DELETE referential_action (like CASCADE) for array elements. If you delete a tags entry, the orphaned ID will remain in your array forever.\n\nThe rule of thumb is that if you find yourself in need of referential integrity - you most likely want a link table, not an array. Arrays are for data that shares the same lifecycle as the parent row. Not for relationships spanning across different tables.\n\nA practical example is the author of a blog post (one author might write multiple other posts), whereas a whitelist of IP addresses for a service account is only applicable to the given entity.\n\nWith JSONB being so flexible, you might wonder why we still bother with quirkier native types. The answer lies in the 'boring' part of the database: predictability and efficiency. An integer[] column guarantees that every element is an integer.\n\nArrays are also more storage-efficient for primitives because they don't carry the metadata overhead of JSON objects.\n\nThis post assumes basic knowledge of arrays. We won't cover the basics.\n\nthat is until you find an array with the arbitrary bounds. Which PostgreSQL allows.\n\nTo make sure you iterate correctly through any given array, always use array_lower() and array_upper() in PL/pgSQL\n\nor generate_subscripts() in SQL.\n\nWhen creating a table, you might expect strict typing. That's true for everything — except the array dimensions. You might think integer[][] enforces a 2D matrix. Except it does not. The [] syntax is effectively syntactic sugar. PostgreSQL does not enforce the number of dimensions of sub-arrays at the schema level at all by default.\n\nIf you want to enforce a specific array dimension, you cannot rely on the type definition. Instead, you must use a CHECK constraint.\n\nThe only exception is that PostgreSQL enforces uniformity of arrays on every nesting level. This means it rejects sub-arrays with different sizes.\n\nWhen accessing array values, it's important to consider that the syntax [1] and [1:1] are different. While the first one is an accessor, the second one acts like a constructor.\n\nWhen slicing an array, even if the slice is a single-element, it will be returned as a single-element array, not a scalar value.\n\nAccessing array values has a forgiving behaviour, making it more difficult to find underlying bugs:\n\nBut the single most confusing aspect that might trip you up coming from other programming languages is the fact that PostgreSQL treats multi-dimensional arrays as a single matrix, not an array of arrays.\n\nWhile in other languages you expect {1,2} as a result, PostgreSQL can't give it to you. It tries to return the first cell and fails (because the index is not complete).\n\nAnd to paraphrase Fletcher's \"Double Bubble\" analogy (which also went very wrong — extra points for getting the reference), you can't fix this by using slice notation.\n\nThe only way to solve this puzzle is to unnest the slice and re-aggregate the results.\n\nThe other alternative is to cast it to JSONB and back. Not pretty no matter how you look at it. If you need to work with complex multi-dimensional structures where each sub-array has independent meaning, just use JSONB. It will do exactly what you expect.\n\nWhile you can use a B-tree index on an array column, it won't help you unless you are looking for whole-array equality and sorting an array by dictionary rules.\n\nRendering B-tree indexes useless for any real-world index operations.\n\nWhen working with arrays, you actually need GIN (Generalized Inverted Index). If a B-tree index is a phone book, GIN is an index at the back of the book. To query one or more elements, you need to find all possible locations and then intersect them to find the locations that match.\n\nGIN indexes are designed for set operations, making presence the key feature, while ignoring order. Here are operators that GIN provides for arrays:\n\nContainment @> - matches rows that include ALL of the selected items.\n\nOverlap && - does the row include ANY of the selected items.\n\nThere's also <@ and = (equality), but they should be easy to understand.\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. While you might often hear (myself included) that you shouldn't use dynamic SQL for IN lists and should use ANY instead, there are some dangers you need to be aware of.\n\nThe ANY operator behaves very differently depending on which side of the comparison the array sits.\n\nThe advice to use ANY holds true when you are passing lists into the database. Instead of generating a query with 100 distinct parameters (WHERE id IN ($1, $2, ... $100)), which bloats your query cache and forces hard-parses, you should pass a single array parameter.\n\nThe trap is assuming this syntax is equally efficient when querying array columns. It is not. If you use ANY to check if a value exists inside a table column, you are effectively asking the database to loop.\n\nWhen you write WHERE 'feature' = ANY(tags), you are not actually using an array operator. What you wrote is a scalar integer equality operator = applied inside a loop construct. Since the scalar operator = is not part of array_ops, the planner assumes the index cannot help and falls back to a sequential scan.\n\nThe correct way to rewrite the query is:\n\nBecause a GIN index is built to work with sets, it is expensive to maintain. With a B-tree index, one row equals one index entry. In a GIN index, one row equals N index entries, where N is the number of elements in your array.\n\nThis leads to write multiplication. To prevent this, PostgreSQL defaults to using a \"fast update\" mechanism. This is a strategy where new entries are added to a pending list (an unsorted temporary buffer) and only merged into the main index structure later (during VACUUM).\n\nGiven the unsorted nature of a GIN index, it is an exception to VACUUM is a Lie, as VACUUM actually does perform structural maintenance here.While this makes INSERT operations manageable, it can slow down SELECTs. Every time you query the index, PostgreSQL must scan the organised main index plus the entire messy pending list. If that list grows large, your query performance might degrade.\n\nIf you operate a read-heavy workflow with infrequent writes, you should disable this to guarantee consistent reading performance.\n\nNow it's time to return to the document model. In PostgreSQL, rows are immutable (MVCC); there is no such thing as an \"in-place update\", and arrays are stored as atomic values. This results in a very uncomfortable truth — to modify a single element of an array, PostgreSQL must copy and rewrite the entire row.\n\nEvery single append rewrites the entire array, which in effect results in a rewrite of the entire row.\n\nWhen any array grows large enough (> 2 KB — see below), PostgreSQL moves it automatically to a separate storage area using TOAST. While this keeps the data row lean, it turns array updates into a severe performance bottleneck.\n\nThe difference this introduces is subtle but comes with a big impact. While a standard MVCC update simply copies the row version on the main heap, updating a TOASTed array forces PostgreSQL to fetch all external chunks, decompress the entire object into memory, apply the change, and then recompress and write the new full-size blob back to the TOAST table. This turns a simple modification into a CPU and I/O-intensive operation that rewrites the entire dataset rather than just the delta.\n\nThe threshold is derived from TOAST_TUPLES_PER_PAGE (default: 4), ensuring 4 tuples fit on a page.Threshold: ~2 KBWhere does the 2 KB value come from? The TOAST threshold is calculated to ensure at least four tuples can fit on a single 8 KB heap page. PostgreSQL uses this to balance efficiency against the overhead of TOAST indirection.\n\nBefore version 14, PostgreSQL relied on pglz — an algorithm prioritising compression ratio over speed. This made the \"decompress-modify-compress\" cycle of TOAST painful.\n\nPostgreSQL 14 introduced LZ4 as an alternative:\n\nLZ4 is significantly faster for both compression and decompression, with only slightly lower compression ratios. If you are working with large arrays, switching to LZ4 is one of the easiest ways to reduce the CPU penalty of TOAST.\n\nYou might have gained the impression that arrays are bad. When evaluating the use of arrays, the real question isn't how big the array is but rather how often do you modify it? An array of 10,000 elements that you write once and is read-only for the rest of its lifecycle is a completely valid use case. An array of 50 elements that you append to on every incoming request is the real villain here.\n\nIf you combine this with compression, you might get an interesting mix.\n\nUp until now, it might seem that arrays don't actually bring many benefits. While they can have rough edges around storage, they are incredibly useful for transport.\n\nThe fastest way to insert 5,000 rows isn't a loop in your application, and it's definitely not a massive VALUES (...), (...) string. It's unnest.\n\nAll that is needed is one network round trip, and one query to parse and plan. PostgreSQL handles the arrays row by row internally for you. This works both for UPSERTs and MERGE.\n\nStandard PostgreSQL arrays are polymorphic types (anyarray). This provides a powerful feature that allows a single function definition to operate on many different data types. They have to handle integers, strings, timestamps, and custom types equally well. But if you have specific data types, you can unlock significant performance gains by using specialised extensions.\n\nIf you are dealing exclusively with 4-byte integers (int4/integer), the built-in array operations are leaving performance on the table. The intarray extension provides specialised functions and index operators that are significantly faster than the generic implementation.\n\nTo use it, you must explicitly enable it:\n\nThe difference in developer ergonomics is immediate. To sort an array in standard SQL, you are forced to unnest, order, and re-aggregate. With intarray, you get native functions like sort() and uniq().\n\nBeyond raw management functions, it introduces a specialised query syntax that simplifies complex boolean logic. Instead of chaining multiple overlap (&&) and containment (@>) checks, you can express your requirements in a single \"query string\" using the @@ operator.\n\nThe only catch is the type restriction. intarray is strictly limited to signed 32-bit integers. If your values exceed 2 billion, you are back where you started.\n\nYou cannot talk about arrays in 2026 without mentioning pgvector. While it markets itself as a \"vector store\", internally it is simply an array of floats with a different mathematical focus.\n\nStandard arrays are binary: they care about Exact Matches (Overlap &&, Containment @>). Vectors are all about fuzzy distance (Cosine <=>, Euclidean <->).\n\nIf you are building search or recommendation features, pgvector allows you to treat your array column not as a list of \"facts\" (tag A, tag B), but as coordinates in semantic space.\n\nNevertheless, the architectural decision is exactly the same as using a standard array: you are trading strict structure for convenience. Since there is no way to \"join\" two rows based on how similar they are, you store the vector directly on the row. You accept a larger table size in exchange for the ability to ask, \"What is close to this?\".\n\nPS: Thanks to Matthias Feist for inspiring this article.",

    "description": "The tech giant is doubling down on a trend of companies operating with leaner workforces, though it's still on the hunt for rockstar talent.",
    "fullText": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says AI is transforming what a single employee can accomplish at the company, signaling it's adopting a new hiring strategy.\n\nOn an earnings call with analysts Thursday, Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said the company is investing in more AI-native tools to elevate individual contributors and flatten teams. The effort is being somewhat constrained, however, by a lack of compute resources.\n\n\"We're starting to see projects that used to require big teams now be accomplished by a single very talented person,\" he said. \"I want to make sure that as many of these very talented people as possible choose Meta as the place that they can make the greatest impact.\"\n\nThe Facebook and Instagram parent, which reported fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, said it plans to boost AI spending by between 60% and 87% this year. Meta also said it already saw a significant increase in output per engineer last year, with the majority of that growth coming from the adoption of agentic coding.\n\nThough teams are on track to become smaller, finance chief Susan Li said on the earnings call that the company is still hungry for top talent. \"It remains a very competitive hiring market, but we'd like to invest aggressively where we can,\" she said.\n\nLi also noted that Meta closed out the December-ended quarter with 6% more employees than it had a year earlier, driven by hiring in areas such as monetization, infrastructure, Meta Superintelligence Labs, regulation, and compliance.\n\nMeta isn't alone in focusing on tiny teams. The strategy has become popular in the startup world, where founders have long prioritized scrappiness. It's a trend that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted would take hold back in February 2024.\n\n\"We're going to see 10-person companies with billion-dollar valuations pretty soon,\" he said at the time. \"In my little group chat with my tech CEO friends, there's this betting pool for the first year there is a one-person billion-dollar company, which would've been unimaginable without AI. And now [it] will happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, large companies have been thinning their middle manager ranks in recent years to boost efficiency by reducing bureaucracy, including Amazon and Intel. Meta's Zuckerberg wrote a memo in 2023 entitled \"Flatter is faster,\" and in late 2024, Google CEO Sundar Pichai told staff that the company cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of an efficiency push.\n\nThe trend isn't limited to tech companies. Retailers such as Walmart and Wayfair, and fintech firms like Block, have been moving managers into non-management roles. Some companies have also been conducting multiple rounds of mass layoffs. On Wednesday, Amazon said it would cut 16,000 corporate roles, the company's second round of layoffs in four months.\n\nOn Meta's earnings call, the company acknowledged that its goal of being able to lean on a smaller number of highly AI-savvy employees is challenged by a shortage of compute resources, as demand across the company has increased faster than its supply. Still, Zuckerberg expressed confidence in his outlook for greater efficiencies.\n\n\"I think that 2026 is going to be the year that AI starts to dramatically change the way that we work,\" he said. \"As we navigate this, our North Star is building the best place for individuals to make a massive impact.\"",

    "fullText": "Microsoft stock is getting crushed on Thursday.\n\nThe negative post-earnings reaction stems from investors' dismay over weaker-than-expected guidance in a key business area, alongside larger-than-expected spending on AI.\n\nMicrosoft earnings came in above both top and bottom line forecasts, with cloud revenue reaching $50 billion for the first time, but Microsoft stock still plunged 12%, its biggest decline since March 2020.\n\nWall Street analysts were laser-focused on AI spending heading into earnings, and the market's reaction to Microsoft and Meta's results shows that investors need to see strength elsewhere in the business to feel good about surging capex. Meta shares spiked on Thursday, and although its spending outlook jumped, that was offset by robust advertising business.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud platform revenue grew 39% on an annual basis, coming in above the forecast 38.4% but still below the 40% it posted in the previous quarter. According to finance pros, this is the primary factor driving Microsoft stock down.\n\n\"Microsoft allocated scarce GPU capacity away from Azure to 1P products, but the fact that BOTH Azure and the M365 segments fell a bit short is the key negative we're hearing that is driving the modest after-market fade,\" stated UBS analyst Karl Keirstead.\n\nOther Wall Street analysts think Microsoft could face challenges in the coming months if it can't find a way to boost its cloud revenue and win back Wall Street's confidence.\n\n\"I think sentiment around Microsoft is kind of negative right now. And if they don't really beat or re-accelerate Azure growth, the shares are probably not going to perform very well,\" Ryuta Makino of Gabelli Funds said.\n\nTech guru and University of Michigan professor Erik Gordon pointed to Microsoft's excessive spending as a catalyst for the stock's decline, noting that he sees it as a clear indication of a bubble in AI.\n\nTo get back to where it needs to be, though, Microsoft may need to spend even more. Blake Crawford, CIO of tech consulting firm Fusion Collective, raised the concern that much of its growth prospects hinge on the success of OpenAI.\n\n\"The number that sticks out like a sore thumb: remaining commercial obligations are up 110% to $625 billion, and OpenAI is a whopping 45% of that,\" he stated. \"That's a lot of hope-and-a-prayer that OpenAI will be able to deliver. And recognizing any potential upside will require significant capex.\"",

    "description": "In the final moments of Tesla's earnings call, Elon Musk urged companies to stop ignoring geopolitical risks by relying on foreign battery production.",
    "fullText": "\"Can other people, please, for the love of God, in the name of all that is holy, can others please build this stuff?\"\n\nElon Musk made the plea in the final moments of Tesla's earnings call on Wednesday, sounding a bit fired up.\n\nMusk had just finished giving a blunt warning to American companies: build more battery-making infrastructure in the US or risk falling behind.\n\nThe Tesla CEO argued that too many companies are underestimating their exposure to geopolitical risks posed by fragile supply chains, particularly for critical materials used in electric vehicles and energy storage.\n\n\"There are so many companies out there that are asleep at the switch with regard to geopolitical risk — or they just have their head in the sand and hope nothing bad will happen,\" Musk said. \"I'm way more paranoid than that.\"\n\nHe added that his concern has pushed Tesla to take unusual — and expensive — steps to protect its future, including building its own lithium-refining and battery-production facilities in Texas.\n\nIn December 2024, the company began processing lithium from its $1 billion Robstown, Texas, refinery. This month, Tesla announced it is producing dry-electrode 4680 cells with both anode and cathode made in Austin, which will end up in \"certain Model Ys.\"\n\nOn the call, Musk described those facilities as \"more advanced than anything else in the world,\" but stressed that Tesla does not want to be the only company making such investments.\n\n\"Why do we have to build these things? Why can others not also please build these things? I mean, it's very hard to build these things, and we're building them out of desperation, because nobody else is building lithium refineries and cathode refineries,\" Musk said.\n\n\"You know, we're pretty much the largest, but also the only lithium refinery and cathode refinery in America,\" he added. \"So, yeah. So. We're making moves to make sure that, no matter what happens, Tesla will prosper.\"\n\nIndependent research suggests Musk's worries are not unfounded.\n\nAn October analysis by the Dallas Federal Reserve identified 66 lithium projects across the US, but found that many remain in early development stages and face long timelines, high costs, and volatile lithium prices. Many projects could take a decade or more to reach commercial production, if they get there at all, the study found.\n\nA few other American automakers are beginning to invest as well.\n\nIn 2024, General Motors invested $625 million in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas Corporation's plans to build a lithium mine in Nevada. The facility is expected to become America's largest mine and plans to open between late 2026 and early 2027. In 2025, the US government took a minority stake in the project.\n\nTesla argues that its investments in battery infrastructure and energy storage have helped offset auto revenue pressure as its car business declines.\n\nTesla's lithium-based energy storage batteries — called Megapacks — reported Q4 revenue of over $3.8 billion, a 25% increase from the year-ago period.\n\nAnalysts express some concern that Tesla is committing tens of billions of dollars to long-term industrial projects, even as the company is openly uncertain about near-term returns.\n\n\"What we learned from the earnings call is that a whole bunch of billions of dollars will be flowing out of the company in the form of capital expenditures: more than $20 billion,\" David Meier, a senior analyst at Motley Fool, told Business Insider. \"That's a massive investment, but it's necessary as the plan is to raise 6 production plants, continue to develop AI infrastructure, and upgrade current manufacturing facilities.\"\n\nMusk warned that companies that fail to insulate against geopolitical risks could pay a steep price.\n\n\"Companies that don't do that,\" he said, \"a bunch of them will cease to exist.\"",

    "title": "I was laid off by Amazon and landed a new role 2 weeks later. Here's my advice for other laid-off tech workers.",
    "description": "After being laid off by Amazon in October 2025, Iren Azra Zou landed a new job two weeks later. She shared her top advice for other laid-off workers.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Iren Azra Zou, a 27-year-old in New Jersey. She is a founding engineer at tech startup Double Nickel, and previously worked as a software engineer at Amazon until being laid off in October 2025. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe day before Amazon announced layoffs in October, there were rumors that something big was coming.\n\nI had a strange feeling in my gut that I might be affected, even though I felt I was performing well and had met my goals earlier than expected. I'd been laid off from my previous tech job the year prior, in 2024, and I knew how, in situations like these, people can quickly become just numbers on a spreadsheet.\n\nIt was hard to sleep that night, and the next morning, I woke up to a 6 a.m. automated text from Amazon telling me to check my email for a message about my role. At that moment, I was pretty sure I had been laid off, which the message soon confirmed.\n\nThe first person I told was my husband, who was next to me in bed. After that, I messaged a few close coworkers to figure out who else had been affected. When I found out that some rock stars on my team had also been laid off, I was shocked.\n\nI was mentally prepared for my layoff — due to the speculation that cuts were coming — but I was also financially prepared.\n\nMy husband and I had taken steps to save aggressively and ensure we had enough savings to last for a while if we were both laid off. That financial cushion helped me stay calm when I found out I'd lost my job.\n\nI made a point to stick to my daily routines: coffee, exercise, and sleep schedule. I didn't want everything to feel chaotic.\n\nI quickly started looking for new job opportunities, and two weeks later, I landed and accepted an offer to start a software engineering role in December.\n\nHere's my advice for anyone who's recently been laid off:\n\nWhen you get laid off, you can't help but ask yourself, \"Why me?\"\n\nEventually, you come to terms with the reality that you can do everything right and still be included in a layoff simply because you're a number on a budget sheet. I know I worked hard and brought a lot to the table; a layoff didn't erase that.\n\nI was prepared for interviewers to ask about my Amazon layoff, but it didn't really come up. I think other companies recognized the scale of the layoff and that it wasn't performance-based, in many cases. I also think that, despite the layoff, having a household name like Amazon on my résumé was probably helpful.\n\nReflect on what you want in your next role and create a targeted job search plan to maximize your chances of landing it. I wanted to make sure I found the right fit, so this was really helpful for me.\n\nUpon reflection, I decided that the best fit for me might be at a smaller company with less bureaucracy than Amazon — and where I could better see the impact of my work.\n\nThe pro of working at a big company was that you could do one thing and it could affect millions of people in less than 30 minutes, which was exciting. However, the downside was that it sometimes felt like you were a very tiny piece in a giant machine.\n\nI was also hoping to land a remote role. For the last few months of my time at Amazon, I'd been required to commute one hour each way from New Jersey to the New York City office five days a week, which was really draining. I figured I might have more leverage to ask for remote flexibility at a smaller company than at Amazon, where so many people are competing for job postings.\n\nMy team at Amazon also didn't have many women, so I wanted to be in a place with a bit more diversity.\n\nI narrowed down my target: a software engineering role at a small company that offered remote flexibility — and where I felt I could grow and thrive.\n\nThis is not the time to be shy — most people will be sympathetic and eager to support you.\n\nI believe my LinkedIn presence — where I'm very active, posting career advice tailored to young professionals — helped me boost my visibility.\n\nThe day after my layoff, the chief technology officer of Double Nickel — a tech startup focused on truck driver recruitment — reached out to me on LinkedIn about a software engineering role they were hiring for. She said she'd seen my post-layoff LinkedIn post and, as a former Amazon employee herself, decided to reach out.\n\nThe role seemed like a good fit, so I applied and quickly landed an interview.\n\nFollowing the interviews, I was given an offer, which I accepted. We agreed to an arrangement where I'd work in a hybrid setup for the first few months to help with onboarding, and then transition to remote work around the end of February. So far, I'm very happy with the role.\n\nLooking back, I see the layoff as a turning point because it helped me clarify what I wanted in my next role. It was still a difficult experience, but I felt more grounded and optimistic as time went on — and ultimately landed a role I feel great about.",

    "description": "Blackstone sees major returns from its data center bet, and plans to continue to \"lean into\" the AI boom.",
    "fullText": "Data center investments have become the engine of Blackstone's growth.\n\nThe Wall Street investment giant reported that QTS, the data center developer and operator it took private in 2021, was the single largest driver of gains in the company's $1.3 trillion portfolio in 2025. The results were a clear sign that Blackstone's bets on digital infrastructure amid the artificial intelligence boom have reaped returns as other segments of its business, including real estate and private credit, have run into headwinds.\n\nIn a call on Wednesday to discuss Blackstone's year-end performance, Stephen Schwarzman, the firm's co-founder and chairman, called QTS now \"the world's largest data center platform.\"\n\nJon Gray, the company's president, said that investor interest in AI was a chief driver of strong inflows. The company reported $239 billion of inflows for the year, its highest total since a record year in 2021.\n\n\"You have what's happening in the AI world, economy growing faster, productivity picking up, and us investing in sectors we really like,\" Gray said. \"We think that will really get this flywheel going, which is why you hear this optimism.\"\n\nGray said its bets on AI and data centers had delivered for the company. Its infrastructure platform — powered by data center appreciation — had grown 40% during the year to $77 billion and had raised $4 billion from investors in the fourth quarter. Infrastructure investments earned 8.4% returns for the quarter and 23.5% for the year.\n\nBlackstone Real Estate Income Trust, the firm's $54 billion retail focused real estate investment fund, meanwhile, generated 8.1% returns during the year, more than double its benchmark for the sector. The fund, which is known as BREIT, is heavily invested in QTS.\n\nReal estate investments, broadly, were the weakest segment for Blackstone, delivering a 0.6% loss for its opportunistic strategy and 3% gains for its core assets.\n\nQTS, which Blackstone originally bought for $10 billion, was the \"largest single driver of returns\" for its infrastructure strategy, Blackstone Infrastructure Partners, as well as in real estate,\" Gray said.\n\nSchwarzman said the firm would continue to \"lean into key thematic areas such as digital infrastructure, including data centers, power, and electrification, private credit,\" as part of its broader investment strategy.\n\n\"The historic pace of investment taking place in the US to facilitate the development of artificial intelligence, including the design and manufacture of semiconductors, data center construction, and the expansion of power generation, is the key driver of economic growth today,\" Schwarzman said.\n\nGray added that the firm's $319 billion real estate platform would \"continue to invest in AI infrastructure and data centers.\"\n\nIn private lending, Gray said the artificial intelligence race and the hundreds of billions of dollars in related spending it will require would also feed the company's private credit business.\n\n\"The build-out of AI infrastructure requires a massive amount of private debt capital for the construction of fabs, energy supply, and data centers,\" Gray said. Fabs refer to computer chip manufacturing facilities.\n\nGray reported that Blackstone's investment grade private credit portfolio now totaled $130 billion, an increase of 30% during the year, while also acknowledging that BCRED, one of its largest credit fund had an \"uptick in redemptions\" tied to industry-wide concerns about default risks.\n\nBlackstone has long touted its focus on data centers.\n\nIn addition to QTS, the firm has invested in the AI developers Anthropic and OpenAI, the storage and high performance computing provider DDN, as well as energy providers who will deliver the prodigious electricity needed for AI computing. Last year, the firm, for instance, announced its $11.5 billion acquisition of TXNM Energy, a utility holding company. In 2024, the company was part of a group of investors that provided the data center operator CoreWeave with a $7.5 billion loan.\n\nBlackstone reported $14.5 billion of revenue for the year and $4.4 billion for the quarter, up 9% and 42% respectively.",

    "description": "Mark Anderson showed up at the Metropolitan Detention Center claiming to have a court order to free an inmate, federal prosecutors said.",
    "fullText": "A man was arrested for pretending to be an FBI agent in an effort to break an inmate out of the Brooklyn prison housing Luigi Mangione, who's awaiting trial over the shooting of UnitedHealthcare's CEO, prosecutors said on Thursday.\n\nMark Anderson showed up at the Metropolitan Detention Center jail claiming to have a court order to let an inmate walk free, federal prosecutors said in a criminal complaint released on Thursday.\n\nAfter Bureau of Prisons officials asked Anderson to identify himself, he produced a Minnesota driver's license and said he had weapons in his backpack, according to the complaint. He also \"displayed and threw at the BOP officers numerous documents,\" the complaint said.\n\nBureau of Prisons officials found a pizza cutter and barbecue fork in the bag, the complaint said.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Brooklyn have accused Anderson of impersonating an FBI agent. He was expected to appear before a magistrate judge in a federal court on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe criminal complaint does not name Mangione. A law enforcement source told Business Insider that Mangione was the inmate Anderson wanted to free from jail.\n\nAccording to the law enforcement source, Anderson had been working at a pizzeria in the New York City area.\n\nAn attorney for Anderson couldn't immediately be identified. An attorney for Mangione didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMangione has been jailed in the Metropolitan Detention Center while awaiting trial for the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024.\n\nHe is still in jail as of Thursday afternoon despite Anderson's alleged efforts, according to Bureau of Prison records.\n\nMangione is due in federal court in Manhattan on Friday morning, when a judge may rule on pending issues, including whether he will face the death penalty at his murder trial. US District Court Judge Margaret Garnett may also rule on whether prosecutors can show jurors key evidence from Mangione's December 9 arrest — including a 9mm handgun and a journal police say they recovered from his backpack.\n\nGarnett scheduled jury selection for the federal charges against Mangione for September. The Manhattan District Attorney's office has asked for a July trial date for its own murder trial against him. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to the charges in both cases.\n\nAs the only remaining federal jail in New York City, the MDC holds several high-profile defendants, including former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. The MDC also holds Oren and Tal Alexander, the luxury real estate brokers who are defendants in an ongoing rape trial in Manhattan.\n\nIn recent years, the MDC has also held Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Sam Bankman-Fried, and Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nWhile judges and defense attorneys have routinely criticized the MDC for its poor conditions, it doesn't have a history of jailbreaks.\n\nFor more than two years, the jail successfully contained Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, the Mexican drug lord who famously escaped twice from jails in Mexico, both times through tunnels dug underneath the buildings.\n\nCorrection: January 29, 2026 — An earlier version of the story incorrectly attributed the identity of the inmate to charging documents.",

    "title": "How to watch NBC: Live stream the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics, and more",
    "description": "NBC is the broadcast home of Super Bowl LX, the Winter Olympics, and much more in 2026. We'll show you how to watch NBC without cable.",
    "fullText": "NBC has long been a popular channel to have in your TV line-up, but the network's upcoming broadcasts of the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl LX make it all but necessary. Fortunately, there are a few easy ways to live stream the network, even if you don't have cable or an antenna. Keep reading to learn how to watch NBC online.\n\nNBC is the home of beloved sitcoms such as \"The Office\" and \"30 Rock\" and flagship procedurals like the \"Law & Order\" and \"Chicago\" universes. In addition to a massive selection of currently airing scripted programming (in addition to series like \"Saturday Night Live\"), the network has become a key player in the news and sports scene. The \"Today\" show and NBC News have long been among the network's main draws, but NBC has increasingly invested in sports over the years, becoming a must-have destination for fans of the NFL, NBA, and the Olympics. NBC is also the broadcast home of flagship events, like the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Super Bowl LX, and the 2026 Emmy Awards.\n\nWhether you're hoping to stream NBC live or get caught up with past network programming on-demand, we've got you covered. Below, we've outlined everything you need to know about tuning in to the network without cable, including a breakdown of NBCUniversal's direct streaming service, Peacock.\n\n*NBC is only available in select regions on Sling.\n\nNBC's direct streaming counterpart is Peacock, a one-stop shop for all things NBCUniversal. There are three tiers of service, ranging from Peacock Select ($8 a month) to Peacock Premium Plus ($17 a month). Select is fairly pared-down and doesn't offer live events, so we recommend Premium or Premium Plus to unlock the full suite of on-demand offerings from the streaming service.\n\nPeacock has a massive collection of-demand seasons of NBC and Bravo shows, among other programming. New episodes typically land on the streaming service the day after their linear broadcast, so if you don't mind waiting a day (and watching with ads), the $11 a month Premium option should do the trick. However, if you'd like to stream NBC live and watch on-demand programming without ads, you'll need Peacock Premium for $17 a month. Both Premium and Premium Plus will carry the Super Bowl and the Olympics.\n\nPeacock Premium Plus subscription is $17 a month. The extra cost gets rid of most ads, allows you to download select titles, and also comes with your local NBC channel.\n\nDirecTV is another solid way to live stream NBC, along with other popular channels. In our guide to the best live TV streaming services, DirecTV ranks as the best cable alternative. NBC is available in several packages, including all signature plans and a couple of cheaper genre packs. Signature plans start at $90 a month for the Entertainment plan, which carries NBC and 90+ other channels (including pretty much anything you'd find in a standard cable plan).\n\nNBC is also available in MyNews and MySports genre packs. MyNews costs $40 a month and comes with 10+ popular news channels, while MySports costs $70 a month and offers around 20 sports networks and access to ESPN Unlimited. All DirecTV plans come with a five-day free trial for new customers.\n\nPreviously known as AT&T TV, DirecTV offers streaming access to a large selection of live channels, including most key networks typically found in traditional cable packages.\n\nIf you're looking for more of a budget-friendly pick, Sling TV will also allow you to live stream NBC and a handful of other channels. It's a great budget live TV service, but it's important to note that local channel coverage (like NBC) varies from region to region, so you should see what's available in your ZIP code before signing up. NBC-friendly plans (where available) include Sling Select and Sling Blue.\n\nSling Select offers around 10 channels and costs $25 a month when local networks are involved. Sling Blue carries 40+ channels and costs $50 a month for those with local channel access. If you're looking for a more comprehensive cable alternative, you can get Sling Orange + Blue for $65 a month.\n\nFor just the essentials without any extra fluff, Sling TV is the streaming service you're looking for. It's more customizable than other plans, with three options you can choose from, so you pay for only what you need. New members often get a chunky discount on their first month.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's sweeping student-loan changes are a key step closer to becoming reality.\n\nThe Department of Education announced on Thursday that it has published the proposed rule on student-loan repayment changes in the Federal Register, a key step the department must complete before implementing the final rule.\n\nAfter Trump signed his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation into law, the department began negotiations with stakeholders on the proposed changes, which included new borrowing caps, the elimination of existing income-driven repayment plans, and a new repayment plan with less generous terms than those of existing plans.\n\nPublishing the rule to the Federal Register is the next step in the negotiated rulemaking process, allowing the department to progress toward implementing the rule in July.\n\n\"With consensus reached in support of the Department's proposed rule, we have a clear path forward to fulfill the President's promise of making higher education more affordable and ensuring that every professional in America—from teachers and nurses to physicians and clergy—can pursue their careers without taking on debt they may never be able to repay,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement.\n\nOnce the rule is formally published on Friday, the public will have until March 2 to comment on the proposed rule. The department said in its press release that it would consider the comments and \"may make changes to the proposed regulations in response to substantive comments.\"\n\nOne key change in the rule is the creation of a new Repayment Assistance Plan. It would set borrowers' payments at 1% to 10% of their income, and any remaining balance would be forgiven after 30 years. It's less generous than the SAVE plan, which the legislation eliminates. SAVE, created by former President Joe Biden, allowed for lower monthly payments and forgiveness after 10 years.\n\nWhile the spending legislation would not eliminate SAVE before 2028, the department announced a proposed settlement which, if approved, would accelerate that timeline and require borrowers to switch to a new plan within a limited timeframe.\n\nIn addition to the new repayment plans, the proposed rule would place new borrowing caps on graduate and professional degrees while eliminating the Grad PLUS program, which allowed graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs.\n\nChanges for defaulted student-loan borrowers are also coming; the rule would allow borrowers in default to rehabilitate their loans twice, a process that would require them to work with their servicer on a payment plan that would eventually result in the default status being removed from their credit reports. Borrowers were previously allowed just one chance to rehabilitate.",

    "title": "I'm trying to guess why Elon Musk wants to mash SpaceX into xAI — or Tesla. I'm stumped.",
    "description": "Elon Musk's companies already share employees, resources and investors. Maybe a possible merger of SpaceX and xAI  — or Tesla — would simplify things.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk starts and owns lots of companies. Maybe he's going to change that, a bit: The world's richest man is reportedly working on a plan to merge two of his most valuable companies into one megacompany.\n\nWhich one of his companies is a question: Reuters reports that Musk wants to merge xAI — his very valuable AI company that has already merged with the company that used to be called Twitter — into SpaceX, his very valuable rocket company. And Bloomberg reports that SpaceX is also considering a merger with Tesla, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe SpaceX-xAI tie-up could help Musk build data centers in space. \"The combination would bring Musk's rockets, Starlink satellites, the X social media platform and ​Grok AI chatbot under one roof,\" the Reuters report says. Then again, Reuters also says it doesn't know several key details about the theoretical deal, including \"its ‌primary rationale.\"\n\nAnd to be honest, the rationale seems a little obscure to me, too.\n\nThe main reason I can think of to merge one private company with another private company that's about to go public would be to make it easier for the smaller private company to finance itself.\n\nIn this case, that would mean that xAI wouldn't have to rely on the private markets as it races after the likes of OpenAI, Google, and Meta in the competition for AI talent and chips. It could tap the public market instead.\n\nThe problem with that theory: People in the private market are lining up to throw money at xAI, which just raised $20 billion. The company boasted that it was only going to raise $15 billion, but people kept throwing money at it, so it had to go and raise more.\n\nAnd, Muskian boasting aside, that makes lots of sense: Despite all the AI bubble chat, people are eager to put money into big, privately owned AI companies, as OpenAI and Anthropic prove every time they raise a ton of money, which happens to be all the time.\n\nJust as important: People are eager to give Elon Musk money because he's made a lot of people a lot of money from Tesla, and they're eager to give him another chance. (That's why the people who helped him fund his value-destroying Twitter deal never once complained about it in public: They wanted a chance to invest in his next deal.)\n\nI've asked Musk, SpaceX, and xAI for comment. It may be worth noting that Musk, who complains about coverage of his companies all the time, did not complain when someone retweeted the Reuters story Thursday afternoon.\n\nI suppose you could also try to argue that SpaceX and xAI make sense together because a bunch of their work overlaps, like the theoretical xAI space data centers that could get built with SpaceX rockets.\n\nBut Elon Musk has always treated his various companies as one big company when it suits him. He moves engineering and managing talent from one company to another when he wants — even when those employees work for Tesla, which is publicly owned, and theoretically should have a problem with lending its staff to other people's companies.\n\nSometimes there are complaints about Musk using resources from one company to help another — or, perhaps, himself. But Musk has pretty much ignored all of those complaints. I can't believe he's interested in moving xAI into SpaceX because he cares about corporate governance.\n\nAnother reason to mash the companies together might be to reward investors who bet on one private company by giving them publicly traded shares in the combined company. But, again, that doesn't really track here: Musk has a bunch of loyal backers, like Fidelity and Valor Equity Partners, which try to get into all his deals, and are already in both companies.\n\nSo maybe there will be a big galaxy-brained rationale for mushing xAI or Tesla and SpaceX together, and we just have to wait for Musk to unveil it. In the absence of that, here's my last guess: Musk, who is already reportedly trying to time his SpaceX IPO to \"coincide with a rare planetary alignment and his birthday,\" per Financial Times reports, just wants his giant SpaceX IPO to be even bigger. Prior to Thursday's report, SpaceX was supposed to go public at a $1.5 trillion valuation — the largest IPO in history. So maybe he's just trying to boost that valuation by a half trillion more.",

    "title": "Darren Aronofsky's New AI Series About the Revolutionary War Looks Like Dogshit",
    "description": "\"Used to be that when Darren Aronofsky wanted to feature a dead-eyed actor, he'd just employ Jared Leto.\"",
    "fullText": "Darren Aronofsky used to be a director who made interesting, if sometimes polarizing, films like Black Swan, Mother!, Noah, and The Wrestler. But it seems like a safe bet that people won’t need to debate whether Aronofsky’s new project is any good. Because anyone with eyes can see that it looks like low-effort AI slop. To put it another way, it looks like absolute dogshit.\n\nAronofsky is producing a new short-form series with his AI production company Primordial Soup titled “On This Day… 1776,” according to the Hollywood Reporter. The series uses tech from Google DeepMind to create short videos about the Revolutionary War, published on the YouTube channel for Time magazine. In 2018, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff bought Time, and the cloud software giant is sponsoring this monstrosity of a series.\n\nThe series uses human voice actors who belong to the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), which is clearly an attempt to tamp down on the inevitable backlash from both inside and outside Hollywood. Folks inside the movie and TV industry have fiercely pushed back against the use of AI to replace the skilled artists and actors who create the media we watch. That concern obviously comes from a place of self-interest because nobody wants to be pushed out of a job. But they also care about the quality of the work being produced. And there’s also been a revolt among the average consumer, people who’ve been inundated with the lowest-grade AI garbage imaginable. It’s really everywhere now.\n\nThe first episode, titled “The Flag,” is three-and-a-half minutes long and attempts to tell the story of George Washington raising the Continental Union Flag in Somerville, Massachusetts. It offers nothing compelling in the way of narrative. It’s the kind of thing that you’d skip over as a cut-scene in a particularly bad video game.\n\nEverything has a dead and creepy quality, as the actors’ audio is poorly synced with the lips of the AI concoctions.\n\nHave you ever seen a Spaghetti Western from the 1960s where the audio just doesn’t seem to match, even though it was clearly shot with actors speaking English, and the “dub” is in English? That happened because the audio was added in post-production, a result of direct sound recording being expensive in Italy during the post-war era. You get the same effect here, though there’s no good reason. Well, no good reason outside of presumably saving a ton of money on hiring human actors.\n\nThe second episode, titled “Common Sense,” tries to tell the story of Thomas Paine writing Common Sense. Benjamin Franklin makes an appearance, though it proves that the most recognizable of the founding fathers in this series are the weirdest to look at.\n\nThe episode jumps around incoherently, much like the first episode, without grounding the viewer in anything we should care about. It’s truly an ugly mess. And if you bother to pause the scenes, you can spot the kind of telltale anomalies that plague other AI-generated video projects, like strangely deformed hands in the background characters. Hands are always giving this stuff away.\n\nThen there are the words that appear on screen in the trailer, like the pamphlet that’s supposed to include the word “America” but instead reads something closer to “Λamereedd.”\n\nHappy to see that there is no need to worry about the historical accuracy of new 1776 AI slop because it happens in the mystical land of Λamereedd.\n\n— Mateusz Fafinski (@calthalas.bsky.social) January 29, 2026 at 1:33 PM\n\nThe series is specifically made for this sestercentennial year of America’s founding, and each episode will reportedly drop on the 250th anniversary of the day it happened, according to the Hollywood Reporter. And that’s certainly a fun concept if the final product were something worth watching. But it’s not. It’s garbage. The people who are making and distributing it obviously don’t think so.\n\n“This project is a glimpse at what thoughtful, creative, artist-led use of AI can look like — not replacing craft, but expanding what’s possible and allowing storytellers to go places they simply couldn’t before,” Ben Bitonti, president of Time Studios, told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe reaction on social media hasn’t been so kind. “I know my expectations were low but holy fuck Darren Aronofsky producing AI slop wasn’t on my bingo card,” one X user wrote. Over on Bluesky another joked, “Used to be that when Darren Aronofsky wanted to feature a dead-eyed actor, he’d just employ Jared Leto.”\n\nAnd other users have been picking apart all the anomalies, with one Bluesky critic writing: “Love the new Aronofsky scene where the colonist takes off his hat to cheer, revealing that underneath it was a second and somehow larger hat.”\n\nLove the new Aronofsky scene where the colonist takes off his hat to cheer, revealing that underneath it was a second and somehow larger hat\n Masterful artsistic choice\n\n— Matt Baume 🏳️‍🌈 (@mattbaume.bsky.social) January 29, 2026 at 10:35 AM\n\n“Nothing represents The End of America after a 250-year run quite like using AI slop to depict the creation of the Declaration of Independence,” another user quipped.\n\nThe videos have been up at Time’s YouTube channel for over 7 hours as of the time of this writing, but they’re not gaining much attention in their original format. The first episode has just 5,000 views. The second episode has a little over 2,000. Social media posts ridiculing the production seem to be faring better, simply because people are making fun of them. One video on Bluesky has over 2,500 quote posts, with almost all seemingly making jokes about how awful it looks.\n\nGizmodo reached out to Ken Burns for comment, but didn’t immediately receive a reply.",

    "description": "I compared 28 of the best cashmere sweaters, from budget brands to luxe investment pieces. My favorites are soft, insulating, and easy to care for.",
    "fullText": "Cashmere is a thin, soft, and finely textured knit fabric made from the fibers brushed from the undercoat of cashmere goats. It gets its name from the Kashmir region of northern India and is distinct from the fibers harvested from sheep that make wool. Even though they're related materials, cashmere is three times more insulating than wool. It's also naturally more breathable.\n\nThe more expensive a cashmere sweater is, the more you can denote from its laborious brushing and production process.\n\nCashmere is only collected as little as once a year, depending on the area, and it can take approximately 4-5 fully grown cashmere goats to make just one sweater. The goats' hair is brushed into \"tops.\" Luxury brands like Loro Piana and Brunello Cucinelli bid on the premium tops, which are the cleanest and palest in color.\n\nIn the US, cashmere must meet a certain criteria:\n\n100% cashmere is more sustainable than, say, polyester. Still, it does take a toll on the environment, and the available quantity relies on the well-being of goat herds, their habitat, and their caretakers. As with any naturally regenerative resource, paying more means investing in the quality of life for those who produce it.\n\nCashmere is graded according to the diameter and length of the fibers. Grade A cashmere uses ultra-fine fibers that are a minimum of 14 microns thick, which feel softer and resist pilling better. Grades B and C cashmere uses thicker fibers that feel less smooth.\n\nCashmere sweaters can last you a lifetime with the right care. Hanging cashmere sweaters will make them stretch, so you should instead keep them folded in a drawer. But beware: this is exactly where hungry moths can be found lying in wait. Keep them at bay with cedar blocks to prevent them from chewing holes through your cashmere clothing.\n\n\"Gauge\" refers to the number of stitches per inch. A higher gauge usually means a lighter fabric. 16-gauge sweaters feel smoother and have a more structured finish, which is ideal for workwear and layering. Looser gauges, like a 5-gauge, have a more casual fit, but may stretch out faster. If you prefer these, look for those with ribbing around cuffs and hems which should help maintain its shape.\n\n\"Ply\" refers to the number of yarn strands twisted together. The higher the ply, the more thick the fabric. 2-ply cashmere is warmer and more dense than single-ply. Single-ply sweaters have that delicate, airy feel, but 2-ply offers a better balance between softness and structure in the long run.",

    "description": "Jeffrey Epstein's victims have accused Bank of America of facilitating Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking operation.",
    "fullText": "Sex trafficking victims of Jeffrey Epstein scored a mixed victory in court on Thursday after a federal judge tossed one of their lawsuits against a bank — but greenlit part of another case against a different bank.\n\nUS District Judge Jed Rakoff allowed portions of a proposed class-action lawsuit filed by victims against Bank of America to move forward, but dismissed other parts of the case.\n\nRakoff dismissed the entirety of a similar lawsuit the victims had filed against another bank, BNY.\n\nThe Epstein victims had accused Bank of America of ignoring red flags for Epstein's sex-trafficking operation. Their lawsuit said the bank facilitated millions of dollars — including over $170 million from former Apollo CEO Leon Black, who said he paid Epstein for tax advice — into Epstein's accounts. They said the funds were used in part to pay hush money to victims.\n\nRakoff dismissed the parts of the lawsuit that alleged the bank \"knowingly participated\" in Epstein's sex-trafficking operation, as well as allegations that it failed to follow know-your-customer laws in monitoring Epstein's accounts.\n\nBut the judge allowed the victims' claims that Bank of America was a \"knowing beneficiary\" of the sex-trafficking operation to move forward.\n\nThe judge tossed an entire lawsuit that the same lawyers filed against BNY, also known as Bank of New York Mellon Corp. The lawsuit had alleged BNY ignored red flags while processing Epstein's wire transfers and by extending credit to a modeling agency financed by Epstein and owned by Jean-Luc Brunel, who died in his prison cell in 2022 while awaiting trial in France for rape charges.\n\nDavid Boies, an attorney representing the Epstein victims, said he would appeal the dismissal of the BNY lawsuit.\n\n\"We are pleased that the Court sustained our sex trafficking claims against Bank of America, and we look forward to trying that case in May,\" Boies said in a statement. \"We respectively disagree with the Court's dismissal of the complaint against Bank of New York Mellon and we will seek appellate review.\"\n\nRakoff had expressed skepticism about the strength of both lawsuits during a December hearing in his lower Manhattan courtroom. He called them both \"a model of high-pitched rhetoric\" and compared them unfavorably to earlier lawsuits the same attorneys had brought on behalf of Epstein victims against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, which settled for $290 million and $75 million, respectively.\n\nAt the end of the December hearing, Rakoff gave the lawyers two weeks to file amended versions of their lawsuits with more detail.\n\nThe revisions appeared not to satisfy Rakoff. He dismissed the counts \"with prejudice\" — meaning the lawyers won't get another chance to amend their lawsuits — and said he would issue an opinion explaining his reasoning by February 13.\n\n\"We are pleased with the court's decision dismissing the lawsuit in its entirety, which reinforces that BNY had no involvement in Epstein's crimes,\" BNY spokesperson Ryan Wells told Business Insider. \"BNY has great sympathy for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein and believes his crimes should be fully investigated and prosecuted.\"\n\nIn court, Bank of America lawyers said it offered nothing more than \"routine banking services\" for Epstein. Bill Haldin, a spokesperson for the bank, said it looked forward to \"a full review of the facts\" as the case moved forward.\n\n\"We are pleased the court dismissed most of the claims,\" Haldin said. \"On the remaining claims, it's important to understand the underlying facts have not been reviewed at this stage of the litigation.\"\n\nRakoff had previously put the lawsuits on a fast track, setting deadlines for summary judgment for the spring, which will give Bank of America another chance to have the case dismissed. A trial is scheduled for May.\n\nThe litigation is playing out in the same courthouse where victims have pressed judges to force the Department of Justice to publish its internal files related to Epstein, the well-connected pedophile who killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex-trafficking charges.\n\nThe Justice Department has blown past a December 19 deadline required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed in November, to release all of its files. Victims and members of Congress have asked judges to appoint an independent monitor to oversee the release of the files. Judges have said they don't have the power to make such an appointment.\n\nIn a court filing Tuesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the department had reviewed \"millions of pages of materials, applying redactions as appropriate\" and would publish them \"in the near term.\"",

    "fullText": "The founder of an auto parts company whose bankruptcy rattled Wall Street and prompted a debate about private credit has been charged with fraud.\n\nManhattan federal prosecutors on Thursday charged Patrick James and his brother Edward James in a multibillion-dollar fraud scheme that they allege involved years of fake invoices and the double- and even triple-pledging of assets.\n\nPatrick James is the founder and former CEO of auto parts maker First Brands, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September. Its bankruptcy was followed by the collapse of subprime auto-lender Tricolor Holdings, sparking a broader debate about the health of the credit market that drew in JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.\n\nHis brother had been a senior executive at the company.\n\nThe two men were charged with wire fraud, bank fraud, and conspiracy, including money laundering conspiracy. Patrick James faces an additional count, stemming from allegations that he ran a continuing financial crimes enterprise. A third former executive, Peter Andrew Brumbergs, has pleaded guilty in the case.\n\nProsecutors said the men inflated invoices, repeatedly pledged the same assets as collateral for loans, and falsified corporate financial statements in a series of schemes that yielded billions of dollars in financing.\n\nA spokesperson for Patrick James said he denies the charges.\n\n\"He built First Brands from nothing,\" the spokesperson said, adding, \"Mr. James looks forward to presenting his case in court.\"\n\nEdward James's lawyer issued a statement blasting his client's arrest in Ohio as \"needless theater.\"\n\n\"We look forward to appearing in New York on his behalf, and we have complete confidence in Mr. James,\" the lawyer, Seth DuCharme, said.\n\nJefferies and UBS are among the financial firms that have acknowledged exposure to First Brands.\n\n\"The James brothers obtained billions for First Brands — and millions for themselves — by presenting their lenders with the impression of a successful, growing international business,\" Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton said in a statement.",

    "description": "In a hearing, a judge advised YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson and Virtual Dining Concepts to settle their legal dispute over MrBeast Burger.",
    "fullText": "A judge urged MrBeast and his burger business partner to settle their legal battle to avoid airing \"dirty laundry\" — but paved the way for the case to go to trial.\n\nAt a hearing on Thursday, New York County Supreme Court Judge Jennifer Schecter appeared skeptical about the damages sustained by either side, both of which are suing the other. Despite that, she ruled that both cases could proceed.\n\nVDC said it looked \"forward to having our day in court.\" MrBeast's reps declined to comment.\n\nYouTube's top star, MrBeast (real name Jimmy Donaldson), launched MrBeast Burger, a largely delivery-only venture selling burgers and fried chicken sandwiches, with Virtual Dining Concepts in 2020. Donaldson hoped it would become the cornerstone of a food empire, but the partnership was plagued by tensions over undercooked orders and Donaldson's demands for more control of the business.\n\nIn July 2023, Donaldson's company sued VDC, portraying the YouTuber as a victim seeking to escape an unfair contract that had tarnished his reputation as a philanthropic, family-friendly entertainer. VDC fired back with its own lawsuit, saying Donaldson had walked away from a promising deal and failed to meet various contractual obligations, including appearances and promos.\n\nA big issue for the judge was the level of damages claimed by both sides. She said the evidence presented by MrBeast about bad Yelp reviews over MrBeast Burger orders seemed \"very compelling.\" But she said she was \"very skeptical\" that they \"would materially and irreparably harm the MrBeast brand under the circumstances.\"\n\nThe judge took special interest in MrBeast's argument that VDC owes him royalties over burger sales.\n\nVDC says MrBeast's camp instructed the company to reinvest his royalty share back into the business. MrBeast's side says it's entitled to royalties now that the partnership has fallen apart.\n\nThe judge urged the parties to think about seeking a business solution rather than a legal one, given the cost of fighting the case in court.\n\n\"If they can't take each other anymore, they should be thinking about a buyout, and it may be costly, but at the end of the day, maybe that's what these parties both should want,\" she said.\n\nThe judge also admitted some fascination with the case involving the world's biggest YouTuber and his ill-fated business venture.\n\nDuring the hour-and-a-half hearing, MrBeast's lawyer, Steven Marenberg, alleged that the burger complaints harmed the YouTuber's reputation.\n\nHe said the \"systemic, deep\" dissatisfaction with MrBeast Burger could \"impact, irreparably,\" the YouTuber's brand.\n\nShawn Rabin, VDC's lawyer, countered by claiming that MrBeast wanted to lower the value of the business so he could \"buy it on the cheap\" and take control of it.",

Wednesday’s announcement is the first time since July that rates have not been cut.\n\n“He is hurting our Country, and its National Security,” Trump wrote. “We should have a substantially lower rate now that even this moron admits inflation is no longer a problem or threat. He is costing America Hundreds of Billions of Dollar a year in totally unnecessary and uncalled for INTEREST EXPENSE.”\n\nPowell has not said that inflation is not a problem. He said in December only that it has inched closer to the Fed’s target level, and otherwise insisted the U.S. faces risks from multiple stressors, such as low job growth and economic uncertainty.\n\nTrump appeared eager to push those and any other fiscal concerns under the rug on Thursday. “Because of the vast amounts of money flowing into our Country because of Tariffs, we should be paying the LOWEST INTEREST RATE OF ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD,” he wrote.\n\nThe MAGA leader has repeatedly used hyperbole regarding claims about tariff revenue under his second administration. There is a broad consensus among economists that such levies are not a durable solution to fiscal crises, as higher costs inevitably shift to consumers over time.\n\n“Most of these countries are low interest rate paying cash machines, thought of as elegant, solid, and prime, only because the U.S.A. allows them to be,” Trump went on. “The Tariffs being charged to them, while bringing in $BILLIONS to us, still allows most of them to have a significant trade surplus, though much smaller, with our beautiful, formerly abused Country.”\n\n“In other words, I have been very nice, kind, and gentle to countries all over the World,” he concluded, before demanding again the Fed should “substantially lower interest rates, NOW!”\n\nEarlier this month, Powell made headlines when he defied Trump by releasing a video message regarding a criminal investigation opened by the Department of Justice into the renovation of the Central Bank’s headquarters.\n\n“I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law,” Powell said in his video message. “But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment on this story.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk took the final moments of Tesla's earnings call to warn American companies about global battery supply risks.\n\nTesla has built its own lithium refinery and battery facility to avoid disruptions: \"We wish others would build this,\" Musk said.\n\nRecent studies show renewed interest in building the facilities — but construction has slowed.\n\n\"Can other people, please, for the love of God, in the name of all that is holy, can others please build this stuff?\"\n\nElon Musk made the plea in the final moments of Tesla's earnings call on Wednesday, sounding a bit fired up.\n\nMusk had just finished giving a blunt warning to American companies: build more battery-making infrastructure in the US or risk falling behind.\n\nThe Tesla CEO argued that too many companies are underestimating their exposure to geopolitical risks posed by fragile supply chains, particularly for critical materials used in electric vehicles and energy storage.\n\n\"There are so many companies out there that are asleep at the switch with regard to geopolitical risk — or they just have their head in the sand and hope nothing bad will happen,\" Musk said. \"I'm way more paranoid than that.\"\n\nHe added that his concern has pushed Tesla to take unusual — and expensive — steps to protect its future, including building its own lithium-refining and battery-production facilities in Texas.\n\nIn December 2024, the company began processing lithium from its $1 billion Robstown, Texas, refinery. This month, Tesla announced it is producing dry-electrode 4680 cells with both anode and cathode made in Austin, which will end up in \"certain Model Ys.\"\n\nOn the call, Musk described those facilities as \"more advanced than anything else in the world,\" but stressed that Tesla does not want to be the only company making such investments.\n\n\"Why do we have to build these things? Why can others not also please build these things? I mean, it's very hard to build these things, and we're building them out of desperation, because nobody else is building lithium refineries and cathode refineries,\" Musk said.\n\n\"You know, we're pretty much the largest, but also the only lithium refinery and cathode refinery in America,\" he added. \"So, yeah. So. We're making moves to make sure that, no matter what happens, Tesla will prosper.\"\n\nIndependent research suggests Musk's worries are not unfounded.\n\nAn October analysis by the Dallas Federal Reserve identified 66 lithium projects across the US, but found that many remain in early development stages and face long timelines, high costs, and volatile lithium prices. Many projects could take a decade or more to reach commercial production, if they get there at all, the study found.",

One of them, a limited liability company, lists SpaceX and Bret Johnsen, the company's chief financial officer, as managing members, while the other lists Johnsen as the company's only officer, the filings show.\n\nThe filings don't contain additional information about the purpose of the companies ⁠or their role in any deal.\n\nJohnsen did not respond to a Reuters ‌request for comment.\n\nThe person, who requested anonymity because the discussions are confidential, said that some xAI executives could be given the option to receive cash instead of SpaceX stock as part of the deal. A final agreement, however, hasn't been signed, and the timing and structure of the transaction remain fluid, the person cautioned.\n\nSpaceX is already the world's most ‍valuable privately held company, last valued at $800 billion in a recent insider share sale. xAI was valued at $230 billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal. Reuters and other media have reported that SpaceX plans to go public some time this year, with a valuation expected above $1 trillion.\n\nThrough xAI, Musk is building out a massive supercomputer for AI training in Memphis, Tennessee, called Colossus. Last year, SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI as part of the startup’s $5 billion equity ​fundraising, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time.",

    "fullText": "If you own gold or silver right now, you probably feel smart and slightly anxious at the same time.\n\nI’ve been following this move tick‑by‑tick, and the most striking thing is how calm Jerome Powell sounds compared with what gold and silver are actually doing.\n\nGold has climbed toward $5,600 an ounce after roughly a 64% jump last year, according to the Economic Times. The report also highlights Silver's sprint toward the 120‑dollar level as investment demand, industrial use, and tight supply collide.\n\nAt the same press conference where those price moves were hanging over the market, Powell told reporters “not to take much message macroeconomically” about the significant price increases of precious metals, as highlighted in a clip posted on Cointelegraph’s X (formerly Twitter) page.\n\nThat single line is the clearest view you’re going to get into how the Fed thinks about this metals spike.\n\nWhat really set people off wasn’t just that gold is at record levels. It was the way Powell tried to separate that price action from the Fed’s reaction function.\n\n“Jerome Powell says not to read much into the rise in gold prices,” Cointelegraph captioned the clip on X during the press conference, paraphrasing his answer to a question about the metal’s surge.\n\nMeanwhile, the moves have been anything but minor.\n\nGold recently broke above $5,000 per ounce on safe‑haven demand tied to geopolitical tensions and uncertainty about future Fed policy, even before it extended toward the 5,600‑dollar region, according to Plus500.\n\nMarket uncertainty resets silver, gold bets\n\nBillionaire Dalio sends 2-word warning on markets\n\nEvery major analyst’s gold price forecast for 2026\n\nThe combination of rate‑cut expectations, geopolitical stress and central‑bank diversification has driven precious metals to record or near‑record levels, while sharp pullbacks remain a real threat after such a steep rise, according to CME Group analysis.\n\nWhen I put those pieces together, it feels like the Fed is quietly saying, “We see it, but we’re not going to let gold bully us,” which is not the message metals traders wanted to hear.\n\nIf Powell was trying to calm things down, it didn’t work on the hard‑money crowd. Peter Schiff, who has been hammering the case for gold and silver for years, immediately framed the market’s reaction as a referendum on the Fed.",

He did not enter a plea; instead, he waived his right to a speedy arraignment while he seeks private representation.\n\nA new arraignment hearing has been scheduled for Feb. 12.\n\nThe sheriff’s office said that the criminal complaint obtained by FOX40, Varoff faces five counts of oral copulation of a person under 18 and five counts of sexual penetration of a person under 18, stemming from seven alleged incidents between January 1, 2023, and August 31, 2023.\n\nThe prosecution further alleges several aggravating factors. Those include that the victim was particularly vulnerable, Varoff’s conduct involved planning and sophistication and that the former teacher abused a position of trust and confidence.\n\nThe criminal complaint also states that the offenses occurred at multiple locations, including Varoff’s residence in Sacramento County and his school office in El Dorado County.\n\nVaroff will remain behind bars at the El Dorado County Jail, where he’s being held without bail. But the El Dorado County Sheriff’s Office says this remains an active and ongoing investigation.\n\nThey encourage any potential additional victims or anyone with information related to the case to contact Detective Katz by emailing katzt@eldoradosheriff.gov or calling 530-642-4716.",

    "title": "Senator demands answers after Trump accepted Rolex and gold bar before slashing tariffs on Switzerland",
    "description": "Trump’s love of lavish gifts is well known and many are displayed in the Oval Office",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is being asked to provide more information about the Rolex watch and gold bar he accepted from Swiss businessmen last year, shortly before agreeing to lower tariffs on Swiss goods, by the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nOregon Senator Ron Wyden is seeking more details to determine whether the president violated laws by accepting the gifts before cutting the deal, according to the letter seen by Bloomberg.\n\nIn November, a delegation of Swiss businessmen visited the White House to speak with Trump after he imposed a 39 percent tariff on Swiss goods. Shortly thereafter, a Rolex table clock, which does not appear to be available for purchase by the general public, appeared on the president’s desk.\n\nIn addition, a custom gold bar was displayed on the Resolute Desk, worth more than $130,000, according to Wyden’s office.\n\nLess than two weeks later, Trump announced a deal that reduced Swiss tariffs from 39 percent – the highest tariff placed on any Western country – to 15 percent. The Swiss tariffs remain at this rate.\n\nAt the time, the White House said the gifts were donations to Trump’s future presidential library, complied with U.S. and Swiss laws and were cleared by the White House legal counsel.\n\nIn his letter, Wyden wrote: “Trump’s acceptance of gifts of significant monetary value just days before lowering tariffs on goods from Switzerland creates a blatant conflict of interest and possible constitutional violations.”\n\nThe Independent has asked Senator Wyden’s office for comment.\n\nThe foreign and domestic emoluments clauses are some of the U.S.’s oldest anticorruption buffers. Under the Foreign Emoluments Clause, federal officials are prohibited from accepting a present, office, title or payment from another head of state without the consent of Congress.\n\nWyden also questioned whether Swiss negotiators informed U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer of the gifts before or after presenting them to Trump and which administration official recommended the new, lower tariff rate.\n\nThe White House pushed back on suggestions of a conflict of interest.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement: “Switzerland secured a trade deal and lower tariffs by reducing their unfair trade barriers and committing to invest billions in the United States.\n\n“The only special interest guiding President Trump’s decision-making is the best interest of the American people, and any suggestion otherwise is completely unfounded. President Trump is an extraordinarily successful businessman who can afford his own Swiss table clock.”\n\nTrump’s decision to slap a 39 percent tariff on Switzerland in August stunned the country’s officials, since the U.S. is the top export destination for Swiss goods such as pharmaceuticals, luxury watches and precious metals.\n\nWhile in Davos last week, Trump said he imposed the tariff at a higher rate because he was “rubbed the wrong way” by former Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter. Subsequently, Swiss officials reportedly struggled to convince the president to lower the tariff rate before the delegation of businessmen helped thaw tensions, according to Reuters.\n\nTrump has a well-known love for lavish, personalized gifts, which has raised questions about presidential ethics. Lawmakers and nonprofit organizations have said that the appearance of accepting such gifts leads to concerns about quid-pro-quos or giving certain countries preferential treatment as a result.\n\n“This affair also creates a perception that lavishing gifts on the President, rather than negotiating with [US Trade Representative] is the best way for trading partners to engage with the United States,” Wyden wrote.\n\nOver the last year, Trump has publicly accepted a gold crown from South Korea, a 24-karat gold and glass plaque from Apple CEO Tim Cook, the “FIFA Peace Prize” from FIFA President Gianni Infantino, a gold pager from Israel, a portrait from Russian President Vladimir Putin of the leaders together and a $400 million luxury Boeing 747 jet from Qatar to serve as the new Air Force One, before being transferred to his presidential library.",

    "description": "Growing up in the 21st century is no joke.",
    "fullText": "Zendaya is busy. Euphoria, which she produces in addition to starring in, is finally set to return for its third season on April 12, four years after our last visit to East Highland, and nearly seven since it premiered.\n\nAs frustrating as these between-season breaks can be, they leave plenty of time to explore other tales of the wild lives of high schoolers. It's all relative, though: While growing up in never a picnic, there's drama, and then there's drama. These 15 streamalikes vary widely in tone and style, but they all make clear that being a young person in the 21st century is not f*cking easy. Stream the first two seasons of Euphoria on HBO Max.\n\nKimberly (Pauline Chalamet) is an endlessly naïve scholarship student; Bela (Amrit Kaur) is an aspiring comedy writer on the make for the hottest guys; Whitney (Alyah Chanelle Scott) is an overachieving athlete and senator’s daughter;and Leighton (Reneé Rapp) is a closeted sorority girl. They're all randomly assigned to room together as freshmen at the fictional Essex College in Vermont. Created by Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble, this comedy-drama isn't nearly as salacious as its title suggests. There's sex for sure, but like Sex and the City before it, the funny, queer-friendly show is more about female friendship. Stream The Sex Lives of College Girls on HBO Max.\n\nPeriod drama is having a moment, and this one goes way, way back...to the 1990s. This British comedy-drama stars the brilliant Sharon Rooney (you might know her as Lawyer Barbie) as Rae Earl, a 16-year-old who just spent several months in a psychiatric hospital for a cocktail of mental health issues, poor body image being near the top of that list. Heading back to school, she tries to conceal the truth of her absence and ongoing challenges—with expectedly mixed results. Despite the show's comedy elements, it's about as good a narrative about growing up with serious mental health issues as you're likely to find. Rooney won a well-deserved Best Actress BAFTA for her performance. Stream My Mad Fat Diary on Prime Video, Hulu, and Tubi.\n\nThis British import feels a bit like a latter-day Skins, featuring a scholastic setting and a talented cast of young stars-in-waiting (including leads Josh Tedeku and Jodie Campbell). At the (fictional) prestigious boarding school St. Gilbert’s, five Black teens are newly attending on scholarships, but their integration into the existing cliques is less than smooth. The blend of coming-of-age drama with a willingness to take the piss when it comes to the whole \"rich private school thing\" makes this Tubi original a smashing good time. Stream Boarders on Tubi.\n\nTeen drama at its finest and most bitchy, Gossip Girl follows the many scandals of a group of young Upper East Side socialites and hangers-on. The tangled teenage lives of Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively), her best frenemy Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester), scholarship kid Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley), and plenty more pretty young boys and girls are chronicled in meticulous detail by the title's mysterious, omnipresent Gossip Girl (voiced by Kristen Bell). This one shares with Emily an impeccable sense of style, as its leads never miss a fashion beat. It all seems a bit tame when help up to Euphoria, but the show carved a path nonetheless, scandalizing parents in the mid-aughts. (The two-season 2021 follow-up is also available on HBO Max.) Stream Gossip Girl on HBO Max and Netflix.\n\nAndrea and Marco are twin brothers (both played by Mattia Carrano) with a broad circle of friends living in modern day Italy. Marco has a history of self-harm that impacted his burgeoning swimming career, while Andrea has a secret social media life,messaging men while presenting as a woman. Sexual and gender exploration is the prime mover here, but the show also deals realistically with issues like drugs and bullying and any number of other coming-of-age trials. A bit of a hidden gem. Stream Prisma on Prime Video.\n\nWith a bit of Gossip Girl’s juicy style, Elite follows a group of working-class friends who wind up with scholarships to Las Encinas, a fictional private school that is, in the show’s universe, the most exclusive in Spain. What they find there is snobbery, for sure, but also mystery, murder, and lots and lots of sex (between and among characters of various sexual orientations and numerical groupings). The smart, wonderfully trashy show ran for an almost shocking (in our modern streaming era) eight seasons, with a couple of regional remakes. Stream Elite on Netflix.\n\nThis top-tier teen drama stars Ama Qamata as Puleng Khumalo, a teenage girl who’s lived her entire life in the shadow of a sister who was taken as a baby by human traffickers (Puleng’s parents still hold a birthday celebration for the sister each year). When invited to a party by popular Fikile Bhele (Khosi Ngema), a student at an elite school in Cape Town, Puleng can’t help noticing their similarities. Steeped in the story of her sister, Puleng transfers to the school to get to the bottom of things. There’s plenty of juicy high school drama and family secrets in the mix, but the show is elevated by its unexpected dramatic heft and a multitude of queer characters and storylines. (This is ostensibly a South Africa remake of Elite, but its flavor and sense of identity are so unique that you'd hardly notice.) Stream Blood & Water on Netflix.\n\nComedian Benito Skinner plays himself, sort of, in this buzzy comedy that sees a former high school jock facing his freshman year in college while desperately trying to convince himself and everyone else that he's as straight as they come (relatable, except for the jock part). Much of the appeal is in its deft blending of tones: It's a frequently raunchy college comedy and simultaneously a sweet coming-of-age story about accepting yourself without worrying about what everyone else thinks. The cast includes Adam DiMarco (The White Lotus) and Rish Shah (Ms. Marvel) and while it definitely doesn't go as hard as Euphoria, there are moments of real drama and heartbreak. Stream Overcompensating on Prime Video.\n\nMany of us come from families with philosophies that could be described as less than sex positive. Which is not great. This popular British series imagines the life of a teenager with a parent on the opposite end of that spectrum: Mom (Gillian Anderson) is a sex therapist who’s not particularly good at romantic relationships. As a result, Asa Butterfield’s Otis Milburn grew up with an ambivalence toward the topic—a lack of interest that held until he realized that his inside knowledge of doing the deed could earn him friends (and paying customers) at school. Alongside some classmates, he establishes his own clinic to help his fellow students with their sexual concerns. In the process, Otis, and the show, address a wide range of issues, from birth control and abortion, to masturbation, sexually transmitted diseases, and developing sexual identities. Emma Mackey and Ncuti Gatwa (Doctor Who) also star. Stream Sex Education on Netflix.\n\nIndustry isn’t concerned with a power struggle among people at the top of the ladder; instead, its focus is the fight to climb said ladder. The young wannabe investment bankers it follows would all love to be the terrible rich people from that other show. The main characters come from a variety of backgrounds, but they’re all competing for a limited number of permanent positions at the fictional Pierpoint & Co., a London bank, and they’ll do anything it takes to earn their shot at the big prize. The setting here is seemingly very different from Euphoria's vague greater Los Angeles, and the whole investment banking thing hardly doesn't line up with the trials of high school, but there's a a definite vibe match, as young people face high pressure situations and fight to stay above water in a world rife with traps and temptations. Stream Industry on HBO Max.\n\nDirector Luca Guadagnino (Challengers, Queer) created this series about two American teenagers, Fraser (Jack Dylan Grazer) and Caitlin (Jordan Kristine Seamón), living with their families on a U.S. military base in Chioggia, Italy. Fraser's two moms are both in the army, but he's new to base life. Caitlin, on the other hand, has lived in Chioggia for years with her conservative father. Over the course of a summer, the two gradually bond over their mutual feelings of isolation, as well as their explorations of gender and sexuality. Stream We Are Who We Are on HBO Max.\n\nAs with many teen dramas, Baby kicks off at an elite boarding school (poor kids come of age too, ya know), but this one has a fairly wild spin: It's based (quite loosely) on a real-life Italian scandal involving teen sex workers. Benedetta Porcaroli (Immaculate) stars as Chiara, a rich kid who makes a new bestie in Ludovica (Alice Pagani), who needs money and happens to know a very sketchy guy who might be able to help her earn it. The tone is somehow less lascivious than the premise suggests, although the sex-work-as-teenage-rebellion angle is not for every taste. Stream Baby on Netflix.\n\nThere’s a lot of backstory here that you don’t really need to know to enjoy the show, but in brief, Heartbreak High is a sorta soft-reboot of a popular and long-running 1990s show in Australia, which was itself a spin-off from a 1993 movie. There’s a solid blend of teen drama (sealing with issues related to gender identity, race, and teen sexuality) and comedy (the main characters corralled into the Sexual Literacy Tutorial, with the unfortunate acronym SLT). It all starts with Amelie and Harper, two students at a diverse Sydney high school, who set off a firestorm when they create a detailed map of the sexual exploits of the student body. Stream Heartbreak High on Netflix.\n\n\"What the hell is this doing here?\" you're probably asking yourself. And, fair. But hear me out: This reimagining of the once entirely wholesome Archie comics universe is generally way over-the-top, but it tackles the trials and tribulations of growing up (including recurring storylines involving substance abuse) in a similarly...let's say \"operatic\" fashion. It veers wildly between genres, starting out by blending several coming-of-age storylines with a hot-for-teacher whodunnit: The dour, elderly Miss Grundy of the comics is younged up and is having an affair with Archie in the series opener, leading in to a bloody murder mystery. Before long, we're folding in supernatural horror and alternate universes, things made all the weirder by the way the show seems to take itself absolutely seriously in the face of one bonkers plot twist after another. It's the whackadoo comic-book version of Euphoria. Steam Riverdale on Netflix.\n\nThe popular and controversial British series launched names like Nicholas Hoult, Daniel Kaluuya, and Dev Patel while dealing with hot-button issues like mental illness, substance abuse, and bullying. The show also never forgets—not even for one episode—that it's about teenagers, and doesn't shy away from the sex lives of its large (and ever-changing) cast of characters. There's a pretty straight line to be drawn between the success of Skins and that of Euphoria. Stream Skins on Hulu.",

    "description": "Freezing temperatures, a blanket of snow, and accumulating ice can do a lot of damage.",
    "fullText": "When the cold weather arrives, there’s a tendency among homeowners to focus on the interior—namely, our personal comfort and the utility bills. That’s perfectly sensible—no one wants to shiver in their own house, and no one wants to be slammed with an enormous utility bill, either. But the exterior of your house is just as important.\n\nHeavy snow and icy buildup during extended periods of severe cold can really take a toll on your house. Snow and ice combined with melt/freeze cycles during sunny periods can do some serious (and often completely silent) damage to your home in a variety of ways, from water intrusion through your roof to ice-heavy tree branches crashing into the house. If you live somewhere where you can expect to be buried in snow and ice at some point this winter, here are the products you need to protect your house.\n\nSnow is heavy, and your roof is designed to handle only so much of it. The chances that your roof is going to collapse are probably pretty minimal, but that doesn’t mean letting a ton of snow and ice sit on it for weeks at a time is good for your roof or the structure under it. At the same time, climbing up onto your roof to shovel or sweep snow off is not the safest thing to do. Instead, keep a snow rake on hand. Designed to be used from the ground, a snow rake is a simple tool that lets you scrape a lot of snow off your roof safely, easing the snow load and minimizing the chances that water will infiltrate the house. Just keep in mind that if you install roof cable to prevent ice dams (see below), you’ll need to be super careful using a roof rake, as you can easily snag the cable and yank it loose.\n\nOne often-overlooked problem caused by cold, snowy weather is ice buildup in roof and furnace vents. Sewer vents on the roof and furnace vents that draw in clean air and expel exhaust from your heating system can get clogged with ice, which can cause your heat to malfunction and pose a severe health hazard if fumes build up inside the home. A sewer skewer is a simple solution. It’s just a hunk of copper, really, but copper is an excellent conductor, so it absorbs heat from the sun (and your home’s own gases as they rise up) and radiates that heat back out, melting any snow and ice that form in the vent. It’s shaped to move the melting water away from the vent so it doesn’t just drip down and re-freeze. It’s incredibly simple to install (be careful on your roof, though) and can save you from disaster.\n\nIce dams are layers of ice that form at the edge of your roof, preventing proper drainage. Unchecked, ice dams can really do a number on your roof and even the structure of your house. Preventing ice dams can be relatively easy, however—just install some heated roof cables. Attached to the edge of your roof in a zig-zag pattern, roof cables ensure that ice dams can’t form, and melting snow and ice can drain properly into your gutters.\n\nA common way ice and freezing temperatures can damage your house is through exterior faucets and spigots. Because they extend outside the insulated interior of the house, they’re very susceptible to freezing, and that ice can make its way into the pipe behind it, leading to a burst pipe and a very expensive problem. The solution, though, is not expensive—for about $11, a faucet cover will keep your exterior faucets ice-free and water safely inside your pipes where it belongs. Affix one to every exposed faucet or spigot around the house and you’ll have one less thing to worry about.\n\nIf you have trees near your home, heavy ice and snow can snap off branches, which then smack into your roof or walls—and those ice-laden branches will be heavy when they hit your house. Being a little proactive and trimming back branches—especially old, dead ones—is the best way to prevent that from happening. If you don’t want to call a professional to trim back a few branches, pick up a mini-chainsaw to get the job done. If your branches are a little more than a mini can handle, a full-size chainsaw might be needed—but be sure you know how to handle it, especially if you’re going to be climbing a ladder to use it.\n\nLike ice dams on your roof, your gutters can become clogged with snow and ice, preventing proper drainage and leading to rot and water intrusion. Gutter heaters are an easy solution that prevents ice and snow buildup, ensuring everything drains away from your roof and your house as intended.\n\nThe freeze/melt cycle can be particularly hard on your hardscapes, including driveways and patios. Meltwater gets into small cracks and then freezes, expanding and widening those cracks. After a while, your pavement or asphalt is chewed up and needs replacing. You can do a few things to prevent (or at least slow down) this destruction. Filling cracks in asphalt or concrete as they form with a filler sealer means water can’t get into them in the first place. And sealing your asphalt or concrete surfaces will protect them during those weeks when ice is sitting there, melting and freezing over and over again as temperatures fluctuate.",

    "description": "If you're noticing less AI in your feeds, that's by design.",
    "fullText": "Science fiction and science leaders alike have warned us that artificial intelligence may one day take over the world, but until those predictions come to pass, generative AI's biggest impact on my life has been overloading my social media feeds with slop. It seems I can't open TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube without running smack into bizarre and troubling AI concoctions featuring babies in danger and cats having affairs. It really is the wild west (or maybe Westworld) out there.\n\nI think few among us really believe these videos are any good, and it's pretty obvious they aren't good for us, or for the world. Short-form video is already numbing enough, but this AI content is generally completely devoid of any meaning or substance. And yet, it's everywhere. I haven't spent too much time on YouTube Shorts recently, but in my limited experience, the feed has been chock full of AI, especially if I'm logged out of my personal account.\n\nStill, if you're a dedicated YouTube Shorts user (or a frequent YouTube user in general) you might have noticed something odd in recent days: There don't seem to be quite as many AI videos on the platform right now. There are still a lot, don't get me wrong, but it turns out YouTube has recently taken action to remove some of its AI content—the sloppiest of the slop.\n\nAndroid Police spotted the development on Wednesday, basing its findings on a November report from Kapwing, a company that develops an online video editor. Kapwing investigated AI slop across YouTube's vast content library, noting the top 100 most-subscribed YouTube channels that publish this sort of AI content. In the two months since that report, Android Police noticed that 16 of those 100 channels are no longer with us.\n\nThat includes the most popular AI channel on YouTube, at least according to Kapwing. \"CuentosFacianantes\" had 5.95 million subscribers at the time of their initial report, and produced AI-generated shorts inspired by Dragon Ball. The channel had amassed roughly 1.28 billion views by the end of last year; despite launching in 2020, it had curated its library to begin Jan. 8, 2025, so those numbers were racked up pretty recently. The number two channel, \"Imperio de Jesus\" with 5.87 million subscribers, and the number seven channel \"Super Cat League,\" with 4.21 million subscribers, were also shut down.\n\nAccording to Android Police, the 16 channels in question had a total of 35 million subscribers and over 4.7 billion views across their collective videos. Some of these channels are completely gone, while others simply have had their videos removed.\n\nYouTube CEO Neal Mohan published a post on Jan. 21 of this year describing the company's vision for 2026. Towards the end of that letter, he acknowledges AI content, predicting that, \"AI will be a boon to the creatives who are ready to lean in,\" and comparing it to tools like Photoshop and CGI, adding \"AI will remain a tool for expression, not a replacement.\" However, Mohan was also critical of the technology, noting that it's becoming more difficult to tell real videos from AI. He notes that YouTube is now removing \"any harmful synthetic media that violates our Community Guidelines,\" and is giving creators tools to help identify and block deepfakes.\n\nMore interestingly, the letter includes a section labeled \"Managing AI slop,\" which is the first time I've seen a company like YouTube use that expression. Mohan says that YouTube's goal is to be a place where free expression thrives, but also a place \"where people feel good spending their time.\" To that point, he says, \"To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we’re actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content.\"\n\nMohan doesn't call out any accounts by name, nor does he acknowledge the accounts and content the company has already deleted, but it's a clear line in the sand: YouTube is not against AI-generated content, but it will remove low-quality AI content it feels is, well, slop. That's good news for anyone who uses YouTube (so, pretty much everyone), even if it's far from a cure for the growing problem.\n\nI've reached out to YouTube for comment on this story, and will update this piece if I hear back.",

    "title": "You Can Now Start a Group Chat in Spotify's DMs (for Some Reason)",
    "description": "It's still wild that Spotify has DMs at all.",
    "fullText": "If you and your friends have the same taste in music, you probably text each other what you're listening to. I know when I stumble upon a new discovery I love—or even something I think is trash—I fire it off to the group chat to talk about it. Of course, I just forward the song to the group chat in the Messages app, like any other thing I'd want to send to that group. If you have Spotify, however, you have a new group chat option to choose from: Spotify itself.\n\nSpotify heads might already know that the app has had a messaging feature since August. While the point of the feature is to send Spotify content to your friends, it's a basic messaging service, which means you can send any text you want—including emojis. It's available to any Spotify user, whether you have Premium or just a free account, so long as you're 16 or older. None of that is new today.\n\nWhat is new today is the amount of people you can text at once in Spotify. Since August, chats have been limited to one-on-one interactions. Now, you're able to add up to nine other people at once to a thread. That means 10-person group chats to talk about new music, podcasts, audiobooks, or, of course, anything at all—assuming you actually want to move your DMs to Spotify.\n\nTo start, open Spotify on mobile (this isn't supported on desktop at this time) then tap your profile in the top right corner. Look for \"Messages\" at the bottom of this menu, then choose \"New Message.\" If this is your first time interacting with people on Spotify, you'll need to invite others to chat before you can craft a new message. Here, you'll have the choice to share a link to invite a friend to join your message. You can also find this option from the share menu on any piece of Spotify content, and hitting the \"Invite friends\" option.\n\nOnce you've initiated a message, you'll be able to start crafting new ones—including group chats. Head back to this Messages menu—or hit the share button on a song, podcast, or audiobook—then choose \"Create group.\" Here, tap any friends from the suggestions you'd like to add, then choose \"Create group\" again to finalize the chat. Spotify says the people that appear in the list of suggestions are those you have shared content to before, created a playlist or Blend with previously, were in a \"recent\" Jam together, or are on an active Family or Duo plan. If they don't appear, you can always choose the invite option to reach out directly.\n\nWhoever creates the group is officially its admin. As the admin, you have the power to add or remove anyone from the group chat. If you're in the group chat, you're labeled as a \"Participant.\" Invited members are labeled \"Pending.\" The admin as well as any participants are allowed to block any group chat user for any reason.\n\nThe issue is, do you really want to dedicate a group chat to Spotify itself? Maybe if this feature rolled out when the app launched way back when, it'd be different. But people are set in their ways: It's so hard to get people to move chat apps, especially when it's for one specific purpose. Rather than open yet another thread to keep track of, I think I'd rather just text links to my main group chat—and I'm guessing the other members of the chat would agree.\n\nIf you don't want to use Spotify's messaging service at all, you can leave it behind, and save yourself from getting added to all future group and one-on-one chats. To do so, tap your profile, choose \"Settings and privacy,\" then hit \"Privacy and social.\" Here, scroll down to \"Social features\" and turn off \"Messages.\"",

    "description": "\"The point is, go to the doctors for a check-up or if something is not right. It might save your life.\"",
    "fullText": "\"Last year, after four years of hell, some new extreme symptoms popped up, like shortness of breath and joint pain. A few exams and lots more bloodwork later — wham, bam, thank you ma'am — it was undiagnosed LUPUS this whole time. I've now been on treatment for four months. Always, always, ALWAYS listen to your body above anyone else!\"\n\n\"When I couldn't step out of the shower without completely losing my breath, I finally went to the ER. I was diagnosed with what the docs called the largest deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in my thigh) they had ever seen. A piece of it had migrated to my lung, creating a huge saddle pulmonary embolism.\n\nI spent four days in the ICU and underwent two separate stent procedures to get the clots dissolved. Took about six months to get back to full capacity.\n\nIn my defense, I didn't know leg pain was a symptom of a blood clot, but I shouldn't have let it go on for so long.\"\n\n\"Also can be a sign of kidney disease.\"\n\n\"Ignored this for over two years and eventually ended up in the hospital with kidney failure.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 57, Female, California\n\n—Anonymous, 20, Nonbinary, North Carolina\n\n\"I went to the emergency room the week before I was supposed to return to work from maternity leave. The ER doctor told me my blood pressure was up, but to just go to my primary and sent me on my way. I made an appointment with my primary, and she told me I went through a lot having a baby, and my body is just adjusting.\"\n\n\"I spent three days in the hospital being treated as my heart was only at 15% functionality. My poor husband was distraught, he almost lost his partner, and was sad because he couldn't spend the days with me, instead having to care for my infant. It was scary. Thankfully, I have recovered, but I will spend the rest of my life taking lots of medicine to keep my heart healthy. What I learned is to listen to your body. If something feels wrong, it very well may be, and losing your life isn't worth being afraid to go to the doctor.\"\n\n\"By the time he was willing to share this with me, and we went to a doctor who treated his illness, my husband had between 6-18 months left to live. He delayed his treatment because he thought his 'persona' would be destroyed. He became more verbal and the loving man I recalled after taking his medication. He was a better man… until he was no longer alive. He died at 67. Men, check your PSA count. Save your lives not only for yourselves, but also for those who love you.\"\n\n\"Turns out I was so severely anemic, the breathlessness and coughing weren't from asthma or bronchitis or allergies, but it was from severe anemia for many years, indicating possible heart failure. After an iron supplement and an IUD to slow heavy menstrual bleeding, I haven't had to use an inhaler or asthma medicine in almost seven years. Get your iron levels checked often if you are a female in your 30s and 40s; it can literally make your heart fail.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 47, Female, North Carolina\n\n\"The poor ER doctor lady was so nice, but I was so embarrassed. Like, she literally stuck her hand up my ass. I genuinely felt like I was in John Mulaney's skit about trying to get Xanax and ending up getting a prostate exam because he said he was lying to get prescribed drugs. Unfortunately, because I waited, it's mostly pain management now. Pay attention to rectal issues and eat your fiber! I wanna die writing this. I'm so glad it's anon.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 25, Female, Seattle, Washington\n\n\"Two surgeries, a long hospital stay, followed by a home nurse aid daily to administer intravenous antibiotics and clean the 3-inch section of flesh removed, which had to remain open for weeks for the tendons to heal. You could see my bone and all the other inside things. I have a wicked scar from it.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 63, Female, New Jersey\n\n\"I had open heart surgery soon after, and they were able to remove it. I'll be on medication forever and need to see a specialist twice a year. Had my wife not told me to go to the doctors, I'd be dead by now. This is definitely the short version of my story, but the point is, go to the doctors for a check-up or if something is not right. It might save your life.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 42, Male, Atlanta, Georgia\n\n\"Right before my 33rd birthday, my father passed, and a month before, I had gotten a divorce. So when my period came on and didn't stop after 15 days, I figured maybe my hormones were messed up since I was going through a lot emotionally. I didn't think too much about it — it'll stop eventually, I told myself. That was June of 2025; by August, I was still bleeding. It never stopped. I finally dragged myself into the doctor's office. I was in pain, I was anemic, and I showed up with photos where it looked like I was passing pure flesh the size of my hand. Something had to give.\"\n\n\"I finally got my second opinion four months later. I have endometrial cancer, and I am going to have a total hysterectomy at 33 years old next week. I'm not happy, but it's easier to process knowing what the problem is. And I can't help but wonder if someone had listened to me for all the years I was complaining, if maybe there could have been a treatment for my endometriosis before it turned cancerous.\n\nSo no, a normal cycle should not be 10-15 days per month. No, you should not feel like you are giving birth every month (cramping is normal, but it should not be so severe that you can't walk). If you are bleeding so much you have to resort to wearing a diaper — that's not normal. And if the doctor won't listen to you, make them. Don't wait until you are so anemic you need a transfusion (also not normal), and if you have every single symptom and they tell you the imaging is normal — make them get you a second opinion. Being a woman is hard, but it doesn't mean suffering in silence. Speak up.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 33, Female, Alabama\n\nAlso in Goodful: If You Can Complete More Than 15 Of These Common Phrases, Your Vocabulary Is Better Than 95% Of People’s\n\nAlso in Goodful: \"I Knew Instantly That He Would Be Dead Soon\": Doctors Are Sharing The Biggest Health Issues Patients Ignored Until It Was Too Late, And Whew, I've Been Warned\n\nAlso in Goodful: My Husband And I Separated.

    "fullText": "The first Aston Martin to be designed under the leadership of eminent designer Adrian Newey has appeared in pre-season testing.\n\nThe car's debut had been delayed - although the team have not explained why - but Aston Martin managed to get the AMR26 out for the final hour of running at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on Thursday.\n\nLance Stroll managed only four slow laps before stopping on track, with Aston Martin saying the move was \"precautionary\".\n\nHowever, the car's design has already caught attention.\n\nRunning in an all-black camouflage livery, its nose, side pods and engine cover were clearly different from those that had appeared on most cars so far.\n\nThe test is being held in private and no independent media are permitted.\n\nBut from the few photographs Aston Martin have published, the nose appears wider than the norm on cars designed to the new 2026 rules - with a shape perhaps reminiscent of a duck's bill.\n\nThe side pods are very thin and heavily undercut, the front suspension mounting points are very high on the chassis and the engine cover is heavily cut away.\n\nThe car only arrived in Spain on Wednesday and the team spent most of the day preparing it.\n\nStroll said: \"It was a long day for all the mechanics and everyone in the team pushing flat out to get the car ready.\n\n\"We got a few laps in at the end of the day and it was feeling good. We have to learn the car and understand its strengths and weaknesses.\"\n\nLead driver Fernando Alonso is due in the car on Friday - the fifth and final day of this week's testing.\n\nNewey's cars have won 14 drivers' championships and 12 constructors' titles since 1991 across the Williams, McLaren and Red Bull teams.\n\nHe joined Aston Martin in March last year and has been working on the new 2026 car ever since.\n\nF1 has changed its regulations this year and the chassis, engines, tyres and fuels are all new.

    "description": "Why former England and Chelsea coach Steve Holland could be the key appointment in new boss Michael Carrick's coaching team at Manchester United.",
    "fullText": "Ask people who know Steve Holland well how they would describe the former Chelsea and England coach and the same phrase is repeated.\n\n\"Football is his life,\" a source told BBC Sport. \"Whether it's Champions League, thoughts on players or something else, he has a hell of a brain when it comes to football detail.\"\n\nIt explains why, instead of sitting back and reflecting on the success of Manchester United's 3-2 win at Arsenal, Holland spent the return journey to North West England going through footage of the victory with head coach Michael Carrick and the rest of his backroom team to come up with a plan for Sunday's home game against Fulham.\n\nOn Monday, while the players were given a day off, Holland and company were at United's Carrington training ground, honing the sessions they hope will lead to a third straight Premier League win.\n\nAttention to detail is a Holland character trait, something he has relied on since joining Crewe in 1992, after concluding he would advance further as a coach than he did as a player if he dedicated himself to the profession at a young age.\n\nHolland, 55, believes only former England boss Graham Taylor was younger than him when he gained what is now known as the Uefa A Licence coaching badge, when he was 21.\n\nOf the rest of United's new coaching set-up, boss Carrick had not even started secondary school when Holland began his coaching journey. Jonathan Woodgate is slightly older than Carrick. Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion are younger.\n\nIt is why Holland's presence - and, through his England experience, ability to deal with intense pressure - is so vital to Carrick and his coaching team and why he is getting so much credit for the positive start to a tenure that has already delivered victories against Manchester City and Arsenal and taken United up to fourth in the Premier League.\n\n\"He won't be bothered about the scrutiny and pressure at Manchester United,\" says former Radio Stoke editor Graham McGarry, who got to know Holland well during his 16-year stint with Crewe.\n\n\"He will take it all in his stride and just do his job.\n\n\"His training sessions are fantastic. You can already see the Manchester United players are responding to them.\"\n\nNot that Holland is likely to be talking about it in public.\n\nA second trait that keeps being noted is that he is a man of few words, someone who is difficult to read. \"You never knew whether he was quietly content or silently raging,\" said a source who has worked with him.\n\nBut that mask can help when it comes to delivering messaging. The less someone speaks, the argument goes, the more likely their audience is to listen when something is being said.\n\nIt is far too early to assess Holland's work. It is just over two weeks since the coaching team were introduced to United's players as a group for the first time, but several well-placed sources stress the coaching team work as a collective.\n\nIt should not be dismissed either that while Darren Fletcher didn't win his two games in interim charge, he reset the formation following Ruben Amorim's dismissal on 5 January. The Scot began to lift the mood. He also recalled Kobbie Mainoo. It meant key players Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo returned from the Africa Cup of Nations to a stable environment, which gave Carrick the best chance of success.\n\nChanges to the training programme have been made, according to sources. The days are now shorter, but more intense. There is a different energy about sessions and more focus on individual work with specific players. The matchday routine for home games has been tweaked so players now arrive at Old Trafford slightly closer to kick-off.\n\nCarrick was given the job ahead of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, in part, because of the work he does 'on the grass'. But Holland ran the sessions with England, allowing Gareth Southgate to take an overview.\n\nIn consultation with Southgate, Holland concluded England's formation had been 'too stodgy' in qualification for the 2018 World Cup, triggering the switch to a back three. \"Harry Maguire's ability on the was ball fundamental,\" explained Holland in a half-hour dissection of his work for the Coaches Voice podcast in 2021.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports before the Manchester City game, Maguire recalled his own dealings with Holland.\n\n\"He was magnificent for England,\" he said. \"We all knew what we were doing.\n\n\"I can remember a lot of time working with Steve and he really does drill in tactically how to defend and how to keep the ball out of the back of the net.\n\n\"It's basics but really disciplined basics. I feel he will have a big part to play in making our defensive record a lot better.\"\n\nSince leaving his role with England following Euro 2022, Holland has had a short, unsuccessful spell in Japan and undertook some work for the League Managers' Association.\n\nWhat he has not done is court media attention.\n\nThe Coaches Voice chats and others with the Football Association are rare examples of Holland being interviewed.\n\n\"The perfect number two,\" as he has been described.\n\nThe insight that does exist is revealing.\n\n\"With any session the more the players are enjoying their work the more you will get out of them,\" he explained in an interview published by the FA.\n\n\"It is important to try to find creative ways of delivering repetitive practice to stimulate the players' interest.\n\n\"The key always with practice is the transfer into the game. It is important to try and maximise the possibility of a transfer by not steering too far from the reality of the game.\"\n\nHe may be new to Manchester United but navigating the fall-out from a departing boss is something Holland has plenty of experience of.\n\nIt was then Blues manager Andre Villas-Boas who elevated him from the youth ranks to the senior team at Chelsea. \"I was on holiday in Spain,\" recalled Holland. \"I took the call on day two and returned home on day three. My wife still reminds me of that regularly.\"\n\nVillas-Boas was sacked after nine months back in 2012. His successor, Roberto di Matteo, won the Champions League but was dumped after eight.\n\nBehind the scenes, Holland was impressing. He survived the tenures of Rafael Benitez, Jose Mourinho and Guus Hiddink before quitting to concentrate solely on England after Chelsea won the Premier League in Antonio Conte's first season in charge.\n\n\"At a big club, every day is a drama,\" Holland told the Coaches Voice. \"It is never quite as bad as it is made out to be but your ability to handle these moments are decisive.\n\n\"My experience of life at Chelsea has taught me it is about winning. That winning mentality doesn't include feeling sorry for yourself or making excuses. It means you analyse and push to do better next time.\"\n\nThey seem like wise words given the intensity of the noise that surrounds Manchester United, who will look to add more weight to claims their revival under Carrick and co is more than a flash in the pan when they host Fulham in the Premier League on Sunday.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, it seems Holland is already having a significant positive impact at English football's fallen giants.\n\nThe job might be tough, and the demands might be high, but it is fair to assume the Stockport-born 'football obsessive' is in his element.",

    "fullText": "An octopus species native to the U.K. had a major resurgence in 2025. According to The Guardian, its record numbers excited experts.\n\nThe common or Mediterranean octopus is prospering again in the waters off England's south coast from Cornwall to Devon. Matt Slater, a marine conservation officer at Cornwall Wildlife Trust, told The Guardian the local fishermen's catch was 13 times more than expected in Cornwall. It totaled approximately 233,000 octopuses.\n\nThe numbers were so impressive, the Wildlife Trusts dubbed 2025 \"the year of the octopus.\"\n\nThe species is native to the U.K. but is typically seen in smaller numbers. A milder winter combined with a warm breeding season in the spring created conditions that were ideal for the population boom. The last time that amount of octopuses was present in the region was in 1950.\n\nExperts expect an equally large number of the species for 2026 but predict it will drop off afterwards, following previous patterns.\n\nSlater told the outlet, \"It is unlikely, based on past events, that it will go on for a long time. But the sea keeps giving us surprises at the moment so it's quite an unpredictable situation.\"\n\nOctopuses are a valuable part of the marine ecosystem, consuming crabs, crayfish, and mollusks, helping to keep those populations in check. The common octopus is also noted as one of the most intelligent invertebrates in the ocean. It's able to thwart attacks in unique ways and camouflage itself almost perfectly, per National Geographic.\n\nThere is some concern from experts that the octopus \"bloom\" could impact other kinds of fishing. The U.K.'s Marine Management Organisation has said that crab catching numbers are down. But lobster, crawfish, and scallops have all remained stable.\n\nOctopuses have been popping up unexpectedly in other locations as well. The remains of an octopus washed up on the shores of Aberdeenshire, Scotland, and were taken by scientists for additional study. And a filmmaker diving in the waters around British Columbia received a \"gentle hug\" from an octopus while filming underwater.\n\nShould we be harnessing the ocean to power our homes?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

Coleman declined to participate in the investigation, WFAA previously reported.\n\nFollowing that arrest, Richardson posted a series of Instagram stories saying she had been reflecting on her actions and working to move forward in a positive way.

That’s according to finance guru, Dave Ramsey, who warns that Social Security alone is insufficient, and instead recommends maxing out 401(k) and IRA savings. By 2034, he says, Social Security’s reserves are expected to run out of money if nothing changes. “Depending on ... Dave Ramsey Warns That A Third of Americans Will Learn The Hard Way About Social Security",
    "fullText": "Social Security reserves are expected to deplete by 2034 without policy changes.\n\nSaving 15% of an $80,000 salary builds over $1.5M by 65.\n\nMaximizing employer 401(k) matches captures free money for retirement.\n\nInvestors rethink 'hands off' investing and decide to start making real money\n\nA third of Americans will learn the hard way about Social Security.\n\nThat’s according to finance guru, Dave Ramsey, who warns that Social Security alone is insufficient, and instead recommends maxing out 401(k) and IRA savings.\n\nBottom line – we can’t count on the government to take care of us in retirement. And to be honest, you don’t want to put your retirement hopes and dreams in the hands of the government. Look, if you get benefits when you retire, that’s great. But if your goal is to make Social Security your key source of income, you really are setting yourself up for disaster.\n\nAt the moment, more than four million Americans are turning 65 between now and 2027. “That’s over 11,000 people hitting this milestone every single day. The program's cash surplus is expected to run out in less than a decade,” according to NPR.\n\nThat also means that when more people go to retire, they’ll be met with limited resources from Social Security. With that being the case, many of us need to figure out how to make the most of our finances to have a safe, healthy retirement.\n\nMax out your contributions to retirement accounts if you can.\n\nAccounts with tax advantages – 401(k)s, IRAs, health savings accounts, etc. – are great ways to save and invest for the future. In many cases, contributions to these accounts can help cut your taxable income for the 2025 tax season. You have until April 15, 2026, to contribute the maximum amount for it to apply to your 2025 taxes.\n\nAlso, if your employer offers a match program, contribute enough to receive the highest employer match possible. You can also max out your health savings account if you have one. Let's say your employer will match up to 6% of your salary; maximize that.\n\nConsider this. Let’s say you earn $100,000 a year and that your employer will match 50% of your contributions up to 5% of your salary or $5,000. With your contribution and the employer match, $7,500 is saved every year. Over 30 to 40 years of that, you’ll have a solid balance.",

    "description": "Gold and silver futures tumbled alongside a selloff in the stock market Thursday.",
    "fullText": "Gold (GC=F) hovered near $5,400 after falling from a high north of $5,600 per ounce on Thursday while silver (SI=F) steadied after a choppy session as the precious-metals rally paused.\n\nThe volatility came alongside a wider sell-off in the stock market on Thursday with tech declining following Microsoft's (MSFT) quarterly results. The rapid rally in precious metals faced resistance as the US dollar (DX-Y.NYB) rebounded from its lowest level since early 2022.\n\nHow is US dollar strength affecting precious metals?\n\nWhat caused gold and silver prices to pull back?\n\nWhy are precious metals experiencing increased volatility?\n\nWhat are analysts' current gold price targets?\n\n“The continued surge across metals, especially gold and silver, is entering a dangerous phase, in my opinion,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said on Thursday.\n\n“The problem is volatility feeding on itself. As price swings intensify, liquidity thins,” he added.\n\nGold prices had risen roughly 20% year to date as the greenback weakened against other currencies.\n\nJust last week, Goldman Sachs analysts set a year-end price target of $5,400 for gold, with a potential upside risk due to increased participation from private-sector investors.\n\nThe precious metal rallied past $5,500 on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve held rates steady, with commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell doing little to stop the dollar's slide.\n\n“I see this as a sign that conviction levels in the Dollar-down trade are high,” Robin Brooks, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote in a note on Thursday before gold's descent. He noted that \"the weak Dollar is super-charging the debasement trade.”\n\nSilver topped $120 per ounce before paring gains on Thursday. The precious metal is up roughly 50% year to date, following a stunning rally in 2025.\n\n\"Silver prices have already significantly overshot our forecasted averages, though calling a top is close to impossible in markets displaying near-parabolic price momentum,\" JPMorgan analysts noted earlier this month.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.
