    "title": "Aston Martin had \"huge changes\" to overcome to make Barcelona F1 shakedown",
    "description": "New rules, a different engine partner, and new technical leadership with a penchant for pushing the envelope made Aston Martin a late arrival in Barcelona",
    "fullText": "Like Indiana Jones snatching his misplaced fedora from under a rapidly descending stone doorway, Aston Martin’s timing was dramatically close to the edge this week. The team arrived for the Barcelona ‘shakedown week’ late on the third of the five days and only achieved a handful of laps when its AMR26 emerged from the garage on the afternoon of the fourth.\n\nAston Martin had admitted – albeit quietly and grudgingly – that it was likely to be late and therefore miss at least one of its three permitted days of running. But in truth, this was always going to be on the cards given the involvement of talismanic engineer Adrian Newey, a creative and competitive force to be reckoned with – and a man with a history of pushing development as long as possible so as to arrive with a more mature and competitive package than his rivals.\n\nThe AMR26 has come together over the past few months against a tapestry of further upheavals behind the scenes, as team principal Andy Cowell was moved sideways into an engine-liaison role and Newey added some of his duties to his own portfolio. And along with the challenges of finding innovative solutions to the challenges faced by the all-new technical regulations for 2026, Aston Martin also had to integrate with a new engine partner, Honda.\n\nThis also entailed building its own gearbox after years of buying in the Mercedes powertrain as a package, which also dictated the mounting points of the rear suspension.\n\n\"We obviously are in a bit of a unique situation,\" said chief trackside engineer Mike Krack after the AMR26 ran for the first time on Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"We welcome Honda, our new engine partner, our new power unit partner. We have made our first gearbox in very many, many years, and you pair that with new chassis regulations, new power unit regulations – so basically you could say it's the worst case or the best case, but it's a huge change for us as a team, to be a works team, a factory team, together with these regulations.\n\n\"Then we have Adrian on board, so it's all very exciting and a lot of change, and then Formula 1 is not waiting for you, so you have to be ready. We were a little bit late, but we made it to this test, so I think we can be proud and happy of that achievement.\"\n\nThe AMR26 features a number of distinctive solutions that bear the fingerprints not just of Newey but also chief technical officer Enrico Cardile, who joined Aston Martin from Ferrari last year. The triangular airbox arrangement with ‘Viking horns’ mounted alongside bears some familial resemblance with the first two ground-effect Ferraris raced under Cardile’s aegis; but readers with longer memories will recall Newey employing a similar arrangement on the 2005 McLaren MP4-20.\n\nHonda’s contribution will be interesting since this is in effect an all-new project. The company has a long-standing culture of incubating in-house talent by picking the brightest and best engineering graduates and essentially throwing them in at the deep end. Those responsible for bringing its most recent hybrid power unit to a successful state with Red Bull have been dispersed within the company, partly a consequence of Honda quitting Formula 1 in 2021 and then reversing that decision 18 months later.\n\n\"When you have such a long relationship with the previous partner, you need to know the [new] people, you need to learn the names, how you work with each other, what are your expectations, what are the responsibilities, and all these kind of things,\" said Krack.\n\n\"But it was a good start, a few smiles between ourselves and them, and it's our goal, obviously, to use this time now to integrate as much as we can, to learn how to work together.\n\n\"But I'm very confident. They [Honda] are racers, they are very open, you can challenge them, it's really nice, and I'm looking forward to continuing the relationship.\"\n\nAston Martin's 2026 F1 car is finally on track, causes red flag\n\nAston Martin to lose one F1 test day, intends to run in Barcelona on Thursday\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "title": "Martin Brundle suggests Aston Martin’s F1 car may face challenges despite early hype",
    "description": "Martin Brundle has shared his first impressions of Adrian Newey's debut Aston Martin design during Barcelona private testing",
    "fullText": "Former Formula 1 driver and Sky Sports analyst Martin Brundle has discussed the first Adrian Newey-designed Aston Martin as it took to the track during private testing in Barcelona.\n\nNewey joined the Silverstone outfit as managing technical partner in 2025 and will now serve as team principal in 2026, meaning the AMR26 is the first Newey-designed Aston Martin under his complete management.\n\n\"Adrian, his cars tend to be quite homogeneous in their beautiful, sweeping airflow to them, you often see that. There doesn’t appear to be as many bits hanging off his cars as you do see on some others,\" Brundle told Sky Sports F1.\n\n\"It’s a really hard undercut on the sidepod, and we’ve seen different interpretations on sidepods, front wings across the board, unsurprisingly, with such new regulations.\"\n\nThe 2026 season brings in a new set of regulations to the championship. Newey was tasked with interpreting the new ruleset while also adjusting to a new team and reuniting with Honda, having previously worked with the manufacturer at Red Bull. Brundle raised questions about whether the designer has the right people around him and also pointed to potential delays in Honda's power unit project.\n\n\"We’ve got to assume Adrian has come up with some good ideas, but does he know enough about the Aston Martin wind tunnel and the digital wind tunnel and will he get correlation? Has he got the right people around him to interpret his brilliance?\" the former driver added.\n\n\"That’s a tall order straight out of the box, actually. Adrian was saying to me that Honda are having to play catch-up because they were leaving and then they came back in. So there’s some question marks there.\n\n\"We’ll have to wait and see, but you just know Adrian will have a vision of how to maximise these regulations. Let’s hope he’s done it and let’s hope that car just flies.\n\n\"He’s also legendary for not wanting to sign things off, so when the car was late, it didn’t surprise me at all, to be honest, because Adrian will push that, and he always has done, to the absolute limit because he wants the maximum time of development on those pieces and understanding.\n\n\"He doesn’t have that control function of a Christian Horner, or a Patrick Head, or whatever these days. He’s in charge of all of that, but if it absolutely takes off, then as ever, you can say he got it absolutely right. He’s waited until the last minute before having to commit.\n\n\"We’ll see - we don’t know - but I’m going to assume that car will be pretty handy through the year.\"\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "The Scout's verdict is in ahead of Gameweek 24 in Fantasy Premier League as City visit Spurs.\n\nPep Guardiola’s side visit the capital on Sunday 1 February, with kick-off scheduled for 16:30 (UK).\n\nThe Blues lock horns with Thomas Frank’s side with the view of recording a third win in succession in all competitions.\n\nBut we face a Spurs side who beat Frankfurt 2-0 in the Champions League in their previous assignment, meaning we’ll need to be at our best to collect three points this weekend.\n\nAll roads lead to an enthralling clash in north London and FPL managers will have an eye on proceedings at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nRead the latest Scout report below ahead of Saturday 31 January’s 13:30 (UK) deadline.\n\nRayan Cherki (£6.7m) looks a great option for Fantasy Premier League (FPL) managers ahead of Gameweek 24 (GW24).\n\nThe Frenchman has created 33 chances this season, of which 14 have been big chances, meaning 42.54% of his chances have been big ones. This is team leading at City.\n\nHe has also created a chance, on average, every 30 minutes in the league this season, which is the most of all the regular starters at the Blues.\n\nCherki’s 45 crosses, can only be bettered by Phil Foden (£8.5m) across the City team and his 64 successful passes into the penalty box is ten more than the next most in Guardiola’s squad.\n\nChristian Romero (£5.0m) is Spurs’ form player. The defender has scored six goals this season including three goals in the last three matches in all competitions.\n\nElsewhere, Morgan Gibbs-White (£7.3m) and Matty Cash (£4.8m) are low-owned gems who can return points in Gameweek 24.\n\nGibbs-White has returned two goals, one assist, three bonus points and two clean sheet points in the last four matches.\n\nCash has registered an assist and two clean sheets in the last four gameweeks. This season he has created 19 chances, only eight defenders can better that.\n\nThere’s no membership needed to get up to four tickets per person for our FA Cup fourth round clash with neighbours Salford City*.\n\nPriced from £17.50 for adults and £7.50 for children, it’s a fun day out for all the family on Saturday 14 February.\n\nHospitality for this game starts from just £60 with a wide range of options to suit every budget!\n\n*Tickets are on sale to all fans who have purchased at least one home fixture. You must have had an active supporter number before Sunday 11 January and the previous purchase number excludes previous fixtures v Salford.",

    "fullText": "Juventus director Giorgio Chiellini says the Bianconeri have ‘great respect’ for their Champions League play-off opponent Galatasaray, but insists the Serie A giants were ‘never’ close to signing Osimhen.\n\nJuventus have been drawn against Turkish giants Galatasaray in the Champions League knockout play-off.\n\nIt will be a reunion between Luciano Spalletti and Osimhen, who won the Serie A title at Napoli in 2022-23.\n\n“It’s a strong team with great players. We’ll play the second leg at home, so it won’t end in Istanbul, but we’ll have to be good at going to that stadium to play our game and exploit their weaknesses and limit the big potential and individual players, not just in attack,” Chiellini told Sky Sport Italia from Nyon after the draw.\n\nLEWISBURG, WEST VIRGINIA – JUNE 14: Former Juventus and Italian national team defender Giorgio Chiellini arrives at the airport prior to the official FIFA Club World Cup 2025 on June 14, 2025 in Lewisburg, West Virginia. (Photo by Michael Owens/Getty Images)\n\n“We all know Osimhen, but they are strong in other departments too.”\n\nJuventus have yet to sign a new player in the January window, and Chiellini said that there are no developments for now: “There is no news for now; three days are missing, and you’ll have updates in the coming days.”\n\nBack in 2013, Chiellini was on the pitch and Antonio Conte on the bench when Juventus lost a group stage game against Galatasaray, facing elimination from the Champions League group phase.\n\nIt had been postponed by one day due to heavy snow in Istanbul, but when it was played, the pitch’s condition was far from ideal\n\n“We lost it on the pitch, and I even made the decisive mistake, regardless of the snow and the pitch,” Chiellini said.\n\n“Now we are two different teams. We must respect their quality, because they have quality players in all departments, but we must also be aware of our skills and put in an important performance. It will go down to details, like every knockout game, we’ll have to be mature to play in Istanbul and confirm it the following week.”\n\nA reporter asked Chiellini if he would have liked to play up against Osimhen on the field.\n\n“Right now, I couldn’t cope,” he replied, smiling.\n\nISTANBUL, TURKEY – SEPTEMBER 21: Victor Osimhen of Galatasaray looks on during the Turkish Super big match between Fenerbahce and Galatasaray at Ulker Stadium on September 21, 2024 in Istanbul, Turkey. (Photo by Ahmad Mora/Getty Images)\n\n“But I would love to mark him for 45 minutes. I was unlucky to face him once late in my career when my physical qualities were limited, and I had to rely more on the mental aspect. He’s a strong player, he attacks the space and has natural hunger within that you don’t see in many players.\n\n“Galatasaray have many important players, some of whom have played in Serie A too. Turkish teams are making investments, and there’s great respect for a storied club like Galatasaray. It’s a fascinating challenge, it will be a tough game, but also an important test for us. We still have all to play for in Serie A, Champions League and Coppa Italia. We have some interesting weeks ahead.”\n\nHave Juventus ever been close to signing Osimhen before he moved to Galatasaray from Napoli?\n\n“If you mean that a club likes Osimhen, I think it’s true for all the teams, especially in Italy,” Chiellini concluded.\n\n“But realistically, there’s never been anything more than this.”",

    "fullText": "Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk has admitted his side are struggling to find any consistency in the league this season.\n\nThe Reds are sixth in the table and have lost seven of their 23 league games.\n\nSpeaking after their 6-0 Champions League win over Qarabag, van Dijk said: “I think I said it, in the Premier League, the problem and difficulties that we’re having at the moment is that we don’t have the consistency.\n\n“We can’t, so far, build enough good performances this season. And that’s something we’re working at, it’s something we have to improve.\n\n“We know we can do it, but like I said, not on a consistent basis. That’s why we have been struggling.”\n\nLiverpool’s win over Qarabag featured substitute appearances from teenage trio Rio Ngumoha, Amara Nallo, and Trey Nyoni.\n\nAnd the Dutchman has also warned that the level of scrutiny faced by players could become even harsher for the “next generation” of footballers.\n\nHe said: “I know what comes if you don’t perform. If I don’t have a good moment or a good game, that’s just part and parcel of football. But I’m a human being, and all the players before me have been through it too.\n\n“I’ve mentioned this in previous interviews, I think it’s going to be even tougher for the next generation of footballers. I wish them luck, and I’ll try to prepare them a little by talking to them about it.\n\n“But going forward, it will be very difficult, because everything is so micro nowadays. Back in the day, you played, things happened, good or bad, and that was part of it. For the next generation, it will be very tricky, and I want to help in the best way I can by sharing my experiences.”\n\nLiverpool take on Newcastle on Saturday and will look to get back to winning ways after five league games without a win.",

    "description": "Arsenal players were encouraged to speak up about how they were feeling as Arteta looks to prevent a recent blip in their Premier League title race from snowballing",
    "fullText": "On the morning after Arsenal’s 3-2 defeat to Manchester United, Mikel Arteta realised his players needed one specific message. The Basque and team discussed the principle that “you can't lose something you haven’t won, so leave all that behind”.\n\nPlayers were also encouraged to speak up about how they were feeling. There had been a release.\n\nArteta and his staff are aware of a “fear of failure” discussion encircling his team, so he knew he had to make them look at it in a different way.\n\n“Let’s enjoy it,” Arteta said, as he spoke of how it can’t be like this week to week for four months. The message was a progression of his dressing-room speech immediately after United.\n\n“This is the journey you’re on if you’re going to win the title,” Arteta said. “It’s not always going to go your way.”\n\nIn other words, there will be setbacks, especially if a team is seeking to be champions for the first time. It’s rarely been smooth, despite the perception Manchester City have given.\n\nArteta is said to have pitched the speech at exactly the right tone, something that is more notable since there has been a tendency for such performances to send him further in the other direction; more intense.\n\nStepping back a bit, the Arsenal manager instead came to a realisation. He could see there was something deeper than a normal setback.\n\nThe speech did bring a shift in training, aided by a forgiving win over Kairat.\n\nWhether the message fully sinks in, however, is the next question.\n\nArsenal might go out at Leeds United pumped to make amends for Sunday only for Karl Darlow to make a big save early on or Pascal Struijk to clatter a forward. Then, all the same thoughts from Sunday might surge back.\n\nSaturday does have the feel of a hinge fixture, primarily because Arsenal have such a tough match at the same time that many insiders wonder whether “the biggest game is in their own heads”. They’d still be top if they lost, after all, but no one would even consider that. The talk would be loss of momentum, and belief.\n\nHence Arteta knowing he has to get his team playing with conviction again. Or even, the conviction they offer in every competition that isn’t the Premier League. That alone reflects the psychology around all this.\n\nIt’s also easier said than done, given the “pressure bubble” Arteta’s staff feel the team are in, one obviously expanded by fans and so much social media noise. That’s what long waits without a title do, especially as you get so close.\n\nHence Arteta’s will to try and stamp out that “fear of failure”.\n\nOne of his biggest challenges might be finding a solution, which is why Monday might have been be so important.\n\nOthers still feel it’s Arteta himself that could do with a chat, because of how emotionally he lives all this. Perhaps it’s where Josh Kroenke could offer counsel, from his experience of success with the ownership’s American franchises.\n\nOne complication with any solution, after all, is that it is Arteta’s own intensity that has fed this atmosphere. And while it should never be overlooked that the Basque’s energy was absolutely crucial in restoring Arsenal as a force - and this probably would not have happened without it - the wonder is now whether such an important strength may have to just be tempered to actually get over the line. Not a total reassessment, but a tweak.\n\nArteta’s coaching base, after all, is “trying to control every element of play”. This approach has taken Arsenal to the top, as they tend to win virtually every game on xG. Described as “a probabilities man”, Arteta believes that if you do that in 35 of 38 matches, you likely win the league.\n\nThat final gap to actual victory nevertheless fosters a sense of “trying to win a title by process” and whether he’s overlooking that final human edge required.\n\nA question has been asked over whether the team is now so overcoached it is no longer so geared for attackers to score.\n\nThat can be seen in recent player stats on individual goals and assists, but also in other tangible effects with players, and within games.\n\nIn the 0-0 against Nottingham Forest, for example, Arsenal mostly executed their gameplan and another day would likely have seen them convert an xG of 2.37 to win. Again, probabilities.\n\nBut that in itself arguably illustrated the difference between process and true end product necessary to win the title. People may be fed up with references to Sir Alex Ferguson’s United, but it was hard not to think of one recently resurfaced quote about chasing wins.\n\n“The risk is you shove people in the box, because other teams react... but the value in the risk, if you score in the last minute of injury time - the dressing room after was electric.”\n\nIn order to bring that risk, Arteta pushed for Eberechi Eze’s signing. Except, it was then noted the playmaker was suddenly out of the team much more after failing to track Matty Cash in the 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa.\n\nInsiders similarly talk of how decisions on shape and structure have recently taken precedence over creativity.\n\nAs a Pep Guardiola follower, too, there’s an argument Arteta suffers from the same issue the City coach did in the Champions League; that he becomes so fixated on a gameplan, meaning that there is then a vacuum if it falters.\n\nUnited showed this. At 0-0, Arteta’s plan was to stop transitions by stopping Bruno Fernandes getting on the ball. Arsenal duly had control, and it eventually produced - or perhaps processed - that first goal.\n\nIn the six minutes before Bryan Mbuemo’s strike, though, Arteta was getting increasingly frantic about player decisions and duels. Control gave way to a meeker conservatism, that manifested in the errors for the equaliser. After that, they just couldn’t get into the fight in the same way.\n\nSources say that dynamic has led to certain players becoming too conscious of defensive mistakes, an issue compounded by the feeling there is a “Premier League team” and “a cup team” and it takes a lot to change that. How close, for example, is Martin Odegaard to being dropped?\n\nIf Arteta does want to shake things up, that may happen this weekend. The Norwegian has been visibly struggling in duels, but Leeds are all about duels, which is where Mikel Merino may come in.\n\nKai Havertz is also viewed as transformative, just for how his pressing gets Arsenal playing much higher.\n\nThere is admittedly a fair question over whether the very “monotony” of so many midweek matches is having an effect, especially with that pressing. It’s also been a pattern of Arsenal’s recent seasons that there has been a December-January slump, and it was notable that 2023-24 brought the run to 89 points after a mid-season break. That just poses another reason for a mental reset.\n\nOn that, Arteta is a big tennis fan, and has previously spoken about a 2024 Roger Federer speech at Dartmouth.\n\nIn that, the tennis great spoke about how he actually lost 46 percent of all shots in his career. He just had to remind himself it was only ever one shot.\n\n“When you’re playing a point, it has to be the most important thing in the world, and it is. But when it’s behind you, it’s behind you. This mindset is really crucial because it frees you to fully commit to the next point, and the next point after that, with intensity, clarity and focus…\n\n“You want to become a master at overcoming hard moments.”\n\nArteta has perhaps realised that.\n\nArsenal are probably the best team in the country, and can win a lot this season. They just have to start playing like that again, rather than as a team that can lose a lot.",

    "fullText": "It’s that magical time of the year for MLB fans. Pitchers and catchers report in just over two weeks, and this is the final month of the year without baseball until possibly November.

He anchors a very talented Red Sox rotation.\n\nIt was a little surprising to see Webb on this list, let alone this high. He is a good pitcher who is durable and has good stuff, and if this were an NL-only top 10 list, he should be on it.\n\nThe best young pitcher in baseball, reigning NL Cy Young award winner, and the Pirates only hope to get back to the postseason this decade.\n\nThe two-time reigning AL Cy Young award winner will look to make it three straight in 2026, which also could be his last season with the Tigers.\n\n— Enjoy free coverage of the top news & trending stories on The Big Lead —\n\nNFL: Super Bowl LX odds: Opening line for Patriots, Seahawks revealed\n\nNBA: NBA Power Rankings, 30 teams ranked from worst to first\n\nNHL: NHL Power Rankings, 32 teams ranked from worst to first\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: NFL’s crazy preseason Super Bowl 60 graphic resurfaces\n\nWWE: WWE Power Rankings ahead of Royal Rumble\n\nVIRAL: Shaun White pulls off epic Central Park snowboarding stunt over Shane Gillis\n\nThe post MLB Network analyst Ron Darling ranks his top 10 Starting Pitchers in 2026 appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea and Arsenal are set to renew their rivalry in the second leg of the EFL Cup semi-finals, with both teams having plenty to play for.\n\nLiam Rosenior’s second game in charge ended in a 3-2 loss to their London rivals. Even though Chelsea put up a strong fight late on, they have got work to do if they want to turn things around.\n\nAlejandro Garnacho scored twice after coming off the bench to keep Chelsea’s hopes alive, but the team clearly missed some creativity from the start.\n\nWhile Cole Palmer has not featured much under Rosenior due to injury, he showed what he can do by setting up two goals against Napoli in his return from the bench during a Champions League match.\n\nPalmer will be looking to make his mark if he returns to the line-up, especially with the spotlight on him and fellow England international Bukayo Saka.\n\nIt is a comparison that comes up often, and both have also been mentioned alongside Phil Foden in discussions about the top young talent in English football.\n\nWhen asked for his opinion, Chelsea great Eden Hazard did not hesitate to choose Palmer over Saka.\n\nThe former Belgium international also preferred Palmer when compared to Lamine Yamal, who has recently been shortlisted for the Ballon d’Or.\n\nPalmer equalled a club record in the Champions League with his two assists off the bench against Napoli. Nicolas Anelka is the only other Chelsea substitute to have achieved that.\n\nBoth of Palmer’s assists were finished by Joao Pedro, who later called him a ‘special’ player after the match.\n\nClub captain Reece James also spoke highly of Palmer, and it has become clear just how much his absence has been felt when he has not been available.\n\nLiam Rosenior may look to rest him against West Ham this weekend, keeping him fresh for their trip to the Emirates.",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid were handed a quick rematch with Jose Mourinho's Benfica in the draw for the Champions League play-off round on Friday, while reigning European champions Paris Saint-Germain will face domestic rivals Monaco.\n\nBenfica beat Real 4-2 in their final game of the league phase on Wednesday, with a 98th-minute goal by goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin proving decisive in allowing the Portuguese side to snatch the last play-off spot ahead of Marseille, who were eliminated altogether.\n\nThe defeat also nudged Madrid out of the top eight places in the league standings, which give direct access to the last 16, forcing them into this extra round.\n\nBenfica staged a remarkable recovery to take a play-off place -- they finished 24th in the 36-team league phase, the last qualifying spot -- by winning three of their last four matches after losing their opening four games.\n\nMourinho, 63, returned to the Lisbon giants for a second spell as coach in September. He was in charge of Real from 2010 to 2013 and won one La Liga title and one Copa del Rey while also taking them to the Champions League semi-finals in each of his three campaigns.\n\nThe clubs played each other in the 1962 European Cup final, with Benfica winning 5-3 to claim the last of their two titles to date.\n\nPSG slipped out of the top eight after winning only one of their last five outings in the league phase and finishing in 11th place.\n\nThey will go to Monaco for the first leg and will be wary of the principality side who beat them there in Ligue 1 in November.\n\nHowever, 2004 Champions League finalists Monaco have been in poor form, with just one win in six games since the turn of the year.\n\nThey are 10th in Ligue 1, 21 points behind leaders PSG. However, a 0-0 draw with Juventus on Wednesday allowed them to secure a play-off place in Europe.\n\nPSG also beat French opposition in the play-off round last season, hammering Brest 10-0 on aggregate before going on to lift the trophy for the first time in their history.\n\nElsewhere, Newcastle United will be strong favourites against surprise packages Qarabag of Azerbaijan, with the first leg to come in Baku.\n\nPSG and Newcastle know that if they win, they will play either Barcelona or Chelsea in the last 16. Real's possible last-16 opponents are Manchester City or Sporting, which would mean yet another trip to Lisbon in the latter case.\n\nBodo/Glimt, Norwegian champions in four of the last six years, were also surprise qualifiers for this stage and have been rewarded with a tie against last season's runners-up Inter Milan.\n\nJuventus will take on Galatasaray, while Atletico Madrid face Club Brugge. Borussia Dortmund play Atalanta and Bayer Leverkusen were drawn against Olympiacos.\n\nThe two-legged play-off ties will take place in February, with the winners advancing to the last 16 in March.\n\nAlready through to that stage are the top eight teams from the league phase, including five English Premier League sides in Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and City, as well as Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Sporting.\n\nThis season's Champions League final will be played in Budapest on May 30.",

    "fullText": "If you want to watch top pitching in high school baseball this season, stop by a Bay League game. During Thursday's media day at Mira Costa, three outstanding senior pitchers look physically and emotionally prepared to show how good they are.\n\nGarrett Jacobs from Mira Costa, a UCLA commit, Robby Zimmerman from Redondo Union, a UCLA commit, and Kai Van Scoyoc, a USC commit, are coming off good junior seasons. Add junior Jonah Cohen, a UCLA commit at Palos Verdes, and you have to feel sympathy for Bay League hitters this season.\n\nJacobs was the best of all last season, going 11-1. He had 103 strikeouts and 13 walks in 70 innings. Zimmerman, a 6-foot-6 left-hander, is the best pro prospect because of his size and potential. Van Scoyoc and Cohen will be a formidable one-two duo for Palos Verdes. They all know and like each other, so it should be fun for fans and players when they face off.\n\nZimmerman is a cousin of Redondo Union girls' volleyball standout Abby Zimmerman. Most of the Zimmermans are volleyball players except for Robby and brother Danny, who used to play baseball at Michigan. Yet invite him to the beach and he'll be happy to join in the family fun using his size to his advantage.\n\nTorrance and West Torrance also figure to be competitive in the Bay League. Torrance returns its top pitcher in junior Aiden Anaya, who's playing soccer right now. Joey Kim is expected to be a key pitcher for West Torrance.\n\nMira Costa players have the advantage of walking around or going to the store and running into a Dodger or pro player in Manhattan Beach. The school is holding its alumni game on Saturday and honoring five grads who have played in the major leagues in Kyle Karros, Chase Meidroth, Petey Halpin, Joe Moeller and Jim Pena.\n\nThis is a daily look at the positive happenings in high school sports.

    "fullText": "Swansea City head into the final days of the mid-season window with Vitor Matos still waiting for answers regarding the various transfer questions surrounding his squad.\n\nIt could be that Swansea do business, with one or even two new faces a possibility, but it may be that there are no further additions following the signings of Joel Ward and Gustavo Nunes earlier this month.\n\nThere is also the possibility that players will follow Manuel Benson out of the door – but Matos does not yet know for certain who they will be.\n\nExits for a handful of fringe figures are being discussed, while it is not inconceivable that one of Swansea's big names will be sold – although it would take a head-turning bid to convince the Championship club to do business.\n\nAs the end of his first transfer window as Swansea's head coach approaches, Matos is fairly relaxed.\n\nThe mood might have been different but for the Matos-inspired upturn in form which, for the moment at least, has eased relegation concerns.\n\nAt the beginning of January the two positions where Swansea were particularly keen for reinforcements were right-back and wing.\n\nThose two boxes have been ticked with the signings of Ward and Nunes, yet that does not mean Swansea have shut up shop.\n\nMatos insists he is \"really happy\" with the squad at his disposal, yet he has left the door open regarding further signings.\n\n\"Transfer windows are always important to balance things, to have more depth in the squad or to improve one or two positions,\" Matos added.\n\n\"At the moment we have signed Joel and Gustavo, who are what I wanted in terms of transfers and the club as well, so let's move on and keep seeing.\"\n\nAssuming no key attacking player departs, the position of most interest to Matos is midfield, and more specifically a midfielder with the ability to operate as a number 10.\n\nAfter a little over two months at the helm, Swansea's head coach believes a creator behind the forward line would benefit his team.\n\nFinland international Leo Walta, a 22-year-old who plays in the Swedish top flight for Sirius, is among Swansea's potential targets – but there are others in the mix too.\n\nThe other possibility is that Swansea will sign a central defender, probably a youngster on loan, as a result of the unexpected loss of Kaelan Casey earlier in the window.\n\nWith Ricardo Santos free to leave before Monday's 19:00 GMT deadline, Ben Cabango and Cameron Burgess could soon be Swansea's only senior centre-backs.\n\nEven so, Matos is not desperate for a new face in defence because he feels he has cover options in Ward and on-loan Chelsea youngster Ishe Samuels-Smith.\n\n\"Let's see what the market says,\" Matos said regarding a possible Casey replacement.\n\n\"If there's a right one, yeah [it could happen], if there's not, I'm OK with it.\"\n\nMatos is happy with his options out wide despite the departure of Benson, whose miserable loan spell from Burnley has been cut short, and the news that Zeidane Inoussa will be sidelined for up to three months through injury.\n\nThe feeling is that Nunes, who has arrived on loan from Brentford, can compete with Ronald and Eom Jisung for game-time out wide, while there are others who can be pressed into action on the flanks if necessary.\n\nUp front Liam Cullen will provide back-up to leading scorer Zan Vipotnik, while Melker Widell could once again be deployed as a false nine if and when required as Swansea wait for Adam Idah to return after a hamstring problem.\n\nBobby Wales is Swansea's other option in attack as things stand but they could decide the young Scot's development will be best served by a loan move away for the remainder of this campaign.\n\nAs the Championship's leading goalscorer, Zan Vipotnik is sure to be attracting attention from elsewhere - and Matos acknowledges as much.\n\n\"I think it's always normal that interest can come, with clubs asking,\" he said.\n\n\"I think that's happens not only with us but with every club, [but there is] nothing that is major to say.\"\n\nThere is a big difference, of course, between clubs making enquiries and deals being struck.\n\nSwansea are under no pressure to sell in this window and there is no suggestion that Vipotnik is pushing through a move.\n\nNevertheless, Matos accepts there are no guarantees over his key players given that offers could arrive.\n\n\"There's so much movement in the market all the time,\" he said. \"You never know with the amount of clubs who have the financial possibilities to come and buy a player, where [a deal] is also a financial advantage for [Swansea]. We never know what can happen.\n\nLatest Swansea City news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to the latest Swansea City interviews, news and discussion on BBC Sounds\n\nAcademy products are 'part of the project' - Matos\n\n\"What we know is we want to keep the players with us and of course after that we want to add quality, if it's available and if it's the right profile we want.\"\n\nWhile some uncertainty remains surrounding Vipotnik, the suggestion is that Swansea would demand a huge fee before agreeing to a sale.\n\nThey would also need to find a replacement, which may explain why Birmingham City's Kyogo Furuhashi has been linked with a move to Wales this week.\n\nWhile the former Celtic frontman has his admirers at Swansea, a deal looks unlikely unless Vipotnik is sold.\n\nEthan Galbraith is the other Swansea player thought most likely to attract rival interest given his contribution this season but, as things stand, there is no indication that the versatile Northern Ireland international will move in this window.\n\nSwansea expect Galbraith to stay – and the plan is that Vipotnik will stick around too.",

    "fullText": "Everton manager David Moyes says Jack Grealish \"probably\" needs surgery on his foot stress fracture and is expected to be out for the season.\n\nThe injury would likely end any hopes of Grealish making England's World Cup squad this summer.\n\nThe 30-year-old, who is on a season-long loan from Manchester City, has made 22 appearances in all competitions for Everton this season.\n\nHe has scored two goals and provided six assists.\n\nLast week Moyes confirmed the injury but did not give a timeline for a return.\n\nSpeaking on Friday, the Scot said: \"We believe he's probably going to need surgery, but that's still not absolutely confirmed. It probably rules him out for the rest of the season, yes.\n\n\"It's really disappointing for the player, and for the club and all of us. He's such an important part, a big character, big experience for us.\n\n\"We will miss him, he's done a lot of good things for us.\"\n\nGrealish sustained the injury during Everton's 1-0 over his former club Aston Villa on 18 January.\n\nEverton, who are 10th in the table, are away to Brighton on Saturday.\n\nAsked if it was too early to think about Grealish's long-term future given his success at Everton prior to the injury, Moyes added: \"Far too early\".\n\nGrealish's recent form at Everton led to suggestions that he could earn a recall to the England squad and push for a place at the World Cup.\n\nHis most recent appearance came under caretaker manager Lee Carsley in October 2024.\n\nGrealish won three Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FA Cup after joining City from Aston Villa for a then British record £100m in 2021.\n\nBut he fell out of favour last season, making only seven league starts for City before being left out of the squad for the Club World Cup in the United States.\n\nLatest Everton news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Everton - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Rangers are interested in completing a deal for Southampton striker Cameron Archer before next Monday’s transfer deadline, according to Sky Sports journalist Mark McAdam. Rangers manager Danny Rohl wants attacking reinforcements at the Ibrox club and the Bears have been linked with Hansa Rostock striker Ryan Naderi. They have offered a new bid of around €3.6 million and a sell-on clause for him, but, the German club do not want to lose him. Rangers are now looking at other options to bring to the Ibrox club before the deadline.\n\nRangers also have Leeds United striker Joel Piroe on their radar, and Archer has emerged as the latest player to be linked with the Bears. The 24-year-old has four goals in 23 games for the Saints this term after notching five goals in 40 appearances last term. Archer has proven himself in the Championship, with 20 league goals to his name across three seasons in the division. The Aston Villa star had earlier loan spells at Preston North End and Middlesbrough and will bring enough experience to the Rangers attack having also featured for the likes of Sheffield United and Solihull Moors.\n\nSouthampton are hoping to secure a return to the Premier League at the end of the season and it remains to be seen whether they will be open to losing one of their key players. Rangers are desperate to get a deal for a new striker over the line before the deadline to boost their chances of pipping Hearts and Celtic to the Scottish Premiership title. They are just four points behind league leaders Hearts after 23 matches and having a stronger squad would come in handy in the coming games as the top-three battle for the top prize.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he is decertifying all aircraft made in Canada and threatened a 50% tariff on those planes until American-made Gulfstreams are certified in that country.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he is decertifying all aircraft made in Canada and threatened a 50% tariff on those planes until American-made Gulfstreams are certified in that country.\n\nTrump specifically said he was decertifying the Global Express, a business jet from Quebec-based Bombardier, along with “all aircraft made in Canada.”\n\n“Canada is effectively prohibiting the sale of Gulfstream products in Canada through this very same certification process,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “If, for any reason, this situation is not immediately corrected, I am going to charge Canada a 50% Tariff on any and all Aircraft sold into the United States of America.”\n\nThe threat is the latest episode in a prolonged spat between the US and its next-door neighbor since Trump took office last year.\n\nJust hours earlier, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he expects Trump to “respect Canadian sovereignty” after reports that Alberta separatists met with US officials. And a few days earlier, Trump threatened a 100% tariff on America’s second-biggest trading partner if it struck a trade deal with China.\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump has the legal authority to decertify aircraft; the White House has not released an executive order on any Canadian aircraft tariffs. Trump did not specify any mechanisms to decertify the planes in his post.\n\nNo president has ever decertified jets directly. The decision has always been left up to aviation safety experts at the Federal Aviation Administration, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of industry consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory.\n\n“Using aircraft safety as a tool in a trade war is just an incredibly bad idea,” he said.\n\nBombardier issued a statement pointing out that it has 3,000 US employees spread across 9 US facilities, one of which, in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it has announced plans to expand. It also said it has 2,800 US suppliers.\n\n“Thousands of private and civilian jets built in Canada fly in the US every day,” said its statement. “We hope this is quickly resolved to avoid a significant impact to air traffic and the flying public.”\n\nTrump didn’t clarify whether the decertification action would apply to active or yet-to-be certified aircraft. But an industry source who spoke to CNN on background said that it was the industry’s understanding that it would apply to “new” private aircraft.\n\n“(There is) no indication from folks we’ve talked to that this would impact passenger aviation like Bombardiers that were manufactured 10+ years ago,” the source said.\n\nIf Trump does ground all Canadian-made jets, it would be a blow to US airlines and passengers. In addition to business jets, Bombardier makes the CRJ regional jets used on feeder flights, which typically take passengers from smaller airports to larger airports. United, Delta and American airlines all employ regional airlines that use CRJ on their feeder flights.\n\nBombardier also makes smaller commercial jets, the A220. But some of those A220 jets are made in the United States and some are made in Canada.\n\nSo far none of the regional airlines that provide those feeder flights have reported having planes grounded, Faye Malarkey Black, CEO of the Regional Airline Association, told CNN Thursday evening.\n\nThere are 648 passenger CRJ jets that were made in Canada that are in use by US airlines, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. Those planes are scheduled to make more than 2,600 flights daily, with a total of 175,000 available passengers seats every day.\n\nGrounding those planes would not only cause widespread disruptions to the US airline schedule, it could leave many smaller airports in rural areas without air service. Regional airlines are the only source of flights for 64% of US airports, according to the Regional Airline Association’s data.\n\n“I think this is aimed at business (jets),” another industry source, who asked not to be identified, told CNN Thursday evening. “I’m well aware of what the (social media) post said, that it was all aircraft. But I would be really shocked if the intent was to ground the fleet that serves so many of the president’s supporters.”\n\nTaking those CRJ jets out of the US air travel system would cause widespread chaos, Aboulafia said.\n\n“It would be a transportation disaster,” he told CNN. “If it’s only the Global Express, it’s not that big of a problem. But if it’s all Canadian-made jets … the (US air travel) system would be seriously impacted.”\n\nIt’s also not clear from the Truth Social post if “all aircraft” refers to just planes or also helicopters. Canada is a major supplier of civilian helicopters, including medical evacuation helicopters used to move critically ill and injured patients.\n\nCNN has reached out to the FAA for comment.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional context and developments.\n\nCNN’s Pete Muntean contributed reporting.",

    "description": "If you want to know the state of the art in GenAI model development, you watch what the Super 8 hyperscalers and cloud builders are doing and you also",
    "fullText": "If you want to know the state of the art in GenAI model development, you watch what the Super 8 hyperscalers and cloud builders are doing and you also keep an eye on the major model builders outside of these companies – mainly, OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI as well as a few players in China like DeepSeek.\n\nBut if you want to understand how enterprises are adopting GenAI for real work, you might better look to how Big Blue is doing peddling its hard, soft, and people wares to the Global 10,000. This is where GenAI has to take off if it is to become a sustainable, new wave in data processing.\n\nThus far, enterprises have been enthusiastic about the potential of GenAI, but they have not lost their minds like many companies did in fear during the Dot Com Boom. There are no blank checks, but there are no blank stares, either.\n\nArvind Krisha, IBM’s chief executive officer, has a nuanced view of how AI – and particularly AI inference – might play out in the real world, not in the rarified air of the hyperscalers, cloud builders, and model builders. This is not a new theory, but a strategy that IBM has had four nearly a decade, when it started to work on tensor math engines for its Power10 and z16 compute engines, which are used in the most mission-critical back office systems of record on the planet. The Power11 and z17 have improved tensor cores as well as the vector units that have been part of IBM’s compute engines for decades now, and sales of these processors have been ramping over the past year.\n\n“I do think that there is going to be a lot of concern around the nature of what are the models learning from answering these questions, and do we really want to share that with everybody else or not,” Krishna explained on a call with Wall Street analysts going over the company’s financials for the fourth quarter of 2025. “There are going to be issues around sovereignty – on the uses of these models – and there is going to be questions around just basic privacy. If I look out three to five years, 50 percent of the enterprise usage of AI is going to be in either a private cloud or in their own datacenters, and the other 50 percent is going to be usage of public models. Now there’s also an efficiency question. So if what’s being used on premise is smaller models, then actually it could be that 80 percent to 90 percent of all the inferencing is really in private/on premise, and 10 percent of the inferencing is on a public cloud, but that 10 percent could be at 5X to 10X the price and hence the dollars sort of even out.”\n\nIBM is very much focused on this, which is why it has created its own models as well as packaged up open source and closed source ones in its WatsonX tools, and it is also why it has created several different code assistants to help customers with Power or System z servers to modernize their code using GenAI. It is not clear how many enterprise customers are using these code assistant tools, with Project Bob (which uses IBM models as well as those from Anthropic) being the latest iteration, but there is a skills shortage for these vintage IBM platforms and code assistants are going to fill in the gaps.\n\nIt is not clear how much business at IBM in the final quarter of 2025 was driven by AI, but we do know one thing for sure: It is going to be harder to figure it out going forward.\n\nSince the third quarter of 2023, Big Blue has been providing cumulative bookings for software and consulting relating to GenAI. And a few quarters ago, it only gave out the combined number for bookings. And, according to IBM chief financial officer Jim Kavanaugh, this will be the last time Big Blue provides and stats on AI bookings because, as he put it, these numbers do not accurately reflect the totality of AI revenues from IBM’s enterprise customers.\n\nKrishna said that cumulative AI consulting bookings since Q3 2023 were more than $10.5 billion and cumulative AI software bookings were more than $2 billion, for a combined more than $12.5 billion. We filled in some of the gaps in what IBM said to give you a better model in the table above. (Estimates are in bold red italics, as usual.)\n\nTo put these numbers in a little perspective, over that same time from Q3 2023 to Q4 2025, IBM had $100.8 billion in revenues, and the backlog of AI stuff might stretch out over several years into the future. These bookings, therefore, represent a fairly small share of revenues to date. We also think IBM does not want people to see how little bookings – and therefore revenues – it is getting selling its own GenAI models and tools in a world where OpenAI did around $20 billion in business in 2025 and is projecting $30 billion in 2026, and Anthropic did maybe $6 billion to $7 billion in 2025 with an annualized run rate of $9 billion as it exited the year and will do maybe $18 billion in 2026.\n\nHere is the big table showing how the IBM groups and divisions did over the past two years:\n\nSo, IBM awaits its GenAI fortunes as it learns how to deploy it internally to cut costs and drive revenues so it can sell that knowledge and products, Big Blue’s core systems business is doing well – and not the least of which because its server platforms are AI-ready and, in the case of the System z17 mainframes and their “Telum-II” processors, are having a bit of a boom.\n\nIn the quarter, IBM’s Infrastructure group, which sells servers, storage, switches, and systems software, had sales of $5.13 billion, up 20.6 percent year on year and had a pre-tax income of $1.6 billion. Sales of hardware and systems software were up by 29 percent to $3.85 billion in our model, and tech support for infrastructure was up 1 percent to $1.29 billion.\n\nIBM does not report server revenues uniquely, but did say that System z sales were up 67 percent while sales of Power Systems and storage products together – what it calls “distributed infrastructure” when most of it is for enterprise-class back office iron – was up 3 percent.\n\nIBM’s Software group had sales of just a tad over $9 billion, up 14 percent, with pre-tax income of $3.4 billion. Red Hat accounted for about $2.27 billion of that in our model, up 10 percent, and transaction processing systems for mainframes accounted for $2.59 billion, up 8 percent. The rest of the software group was development tools, AI tools, databases, and software-defined storage, what IBM used to call Hybrid Platforms & Solutions. (Our charts keep the old names for now.)\n\nThe Consulting group drove $5.35 billion in sales, up 3.4 percent, with Strategy and Technology up 2 percent to $2.9 billion and Intelligent Operations (which is really application hosting) up 5 percent to $2.4 billion. Krishna said, by the way, that GenAI represented 25 percent of its current $32 billion revenue backlog and around 15 percent of consulting revenue. The annualized run rate for GenAI consulting was $3.6 billion as Q4 2025 came to an end.\n\nRed Hat’s OpenShift Kubernetes platform, which has AI variations with models and frameworks built in, is driving north of $2 billion in revenues a year and growing at 30 percent a year.\n\nAnd finally, in the quarter, IBM’s “real” systems business – the hardware, software, services, and financing of the basic systems in the System z and Power Systems families but not including development tools, databases, security, and application software – had $9.42 billion in sales in our model, with a pre-tax income of $5.18 billion, or 55 percent of revenues.\n\nThis is one of the largest system and most profitable businesses in the world, and it is important to remember that as we look at the next wave of AI. No, IBM is no Nvidia. But then again, Nvidia is no IBM, either.",

    "fullText": "With the incredible market demand around DDR5 memory and significantly elevated pricing on the more premium DDR5 memory modules, as part of the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D launch there's been some communication that thanks to 2nd Gen AMD 3D V-Cache, using lower memory speeds like DDR5-4800 can be suitable without much of an impact to the gaming performance. But what about for Linux gaming? And other workloads with the Ryzen 7 9850X3D? Complementing yesterday's Linux review of the Ryzen 7 9850X3D are benchmarks of DDR5-4800 vs. DDR5-6000 performance with Ubuntu Linux and this new 3D V-Cache 8-core / 16-thread desktop processor.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D Linux review was done with the GSKILL DDR5-6000 EXPO memory along with the other tested processors while today's article is evaluating the performance of the 9850X3D across 300+ workloads when paired running at DDR5-4800 speeds.\n\nAMD's messaging with the Ryzen 7 9850X3D with DDR5-4800 is that for gaming there can be minimal performance impact compared to using DDR5-6000. They cited 2 x 16GB DDR5-4800 DIMMs costing around $400 to 2 x 16GB DDR5-6000 DIMMs for around ~$470 USD. The prices are very volatile still and so the testing in this article is focusing solely on the performance impact and thus the performance-per-dollar/value being an exercise for the reader depending upon your local memory pricing and whether you'd plan to re-use existing DDR5 memory in your possession or not.\n\nThese benchmarks are mainly done for reference purposes in seeing the performance difference of DDR5-4800 vs. DDR5-6000 not only for gaming but other workloads to help you decide in the cost/benefits of opting for DDR5-6000+ as opposed to potentially going for lower-cost DDR5-4800 DIMMs or re-using some existing DIMMs if you are considering an upgrade to the new AMD 3D V-Cache Zen 5 processors.\n\nThe testing with the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D on the ASRock X870E Taichi was done while running Ubuntu 25.10 with the Linux 6.17 kernel. Thanks to AMD for supplying the review hardware for making this independent benchmarking comparison possible.",

    "title": "AI health care is taking off in China, led by Jack Ma's Ant Group",
    "description": "Ant’s health chatbot has become a top downloaded app in China as users seek personalized care they can’t get from the overburdened hospitals.",
    "fullText": "Ant Group, Alibaba’s fintech affiliate and parent of China’s ubiquitous payment app Alipay, is racing to lead the country’s digital health market with a chatbot designed to be a wellness companion.\n\nIts app, Ant Afu, uses artificial intelligence and agentic capabilities to answer health-related questions, suggest hospital appointments, analyze test results, and remind users to exercise or take medication. First created in June under the name AQ, it had recorded 30 million monthly active users by January, with more than half of them living in small cities, according to Ant Group’s chief executive Han Xinyi.\n\nInternet users have increasingly turned to AI for everyday health questions and companionship, especially in markets where access to physicians is limited. Despite concerns about patient safety and data privacy, products like Ant Afu are widely embraced in China as consumers seek more personalized, round-the-clock health support.\n\nChina’s primary care system is underdeveloped. Most people seek treatment for everything from the flu to cancer at sprawling, overcrowded public hospitals that are concentrated in big cities. Patients often complain of long wait times, short consultations, and poor bedside manner of exhausted clinicians.\n\nThis demand for better care, combined with a fast-aging population, has created a fertile ground for digital health products that can spare people the burden of visiting hospitals. Tech companies including JD.com, ByteDance, and Baidu have all built online medical consultation tools, and more recently, chatbots branded as AI doctors.\n\nAnt has a unique advantage as Alipay has long hosted the appointment and payment systems for many hospitals. Millions of people access their national medical insurance accounts through Alipay. In January 2025, Ant acquired Haodf, a leading online consultation portal with more than 300,000 registered physicians.\n\nIn the U.S., AI companies are also expanding their health-care offerings, but they do not yet offer direct access to the country’s large number of private providers and insurers. This month, both OpenAI and Anthropic announced tools targeting consumers, health-care providers, and clinical researchers. Both ChatGPT and Claude now offer features that analyze users’ medical reports and fitness data.\n\nAmong its domestic rivals, Ant’s extensive partnerships with regulators, hospitals, and doctors give it an edge in the AI health-care race, Ivy Yang, a China tech analyst and founder of New York-based consulting firm Wavelet Strategy, told Rest of World. On Ant Afu, users can ask health-related questions, book online consultations and offline appointments at major hospitals, and get reimbursed by state or commercial insurance.\n\n“For startups, the bureaucratic red tape and initial investment required to build the platform, be compliant with all health-care data [regulations], and deal with various government agencies seem like too big a hurdle to overcome,” Yang said.\n\nAnt’s foray into health care has been endorsed by its billionaire founder Jack Ma. He came up with the name Afu, because it made the chatbot sound like a friend, chief executive Han told Chinese tech outlet Latepost this month. “He really cares about whether or not Afu can be like an AI friend that offers emotional companionship and humane care,” Han said, “rather than being just a tool for solving professional problems.”\n\nMa hopes to one day launch the app in underdeveloped parts of Africa and Southeast Asia, Han said.\n\nAnt has spent tens of millions of dollars marketing Afu in China, according to Han. Ant Afu ads have popped up in subway stations, on social media feeds, inside public restrooms, and have been painted on walls in rural China, according to photos shared online. By the end of January, Ant Afu ranked among the top ten most-downloaded iOS apps in China, according to Sensor Tower data.\n\nThe expanding role of AI in patient care, a largely unregulated area, has also prompted warnings about misinformation around the world.  A recent investigation by The Guardian found that Google’s AI summaries were giving out inaccurate health advice. Academics have also found AI diagnostic tools to harbor racial or socioeconomic biases.",

    "description": "An X post about rejecting a candidate over their \"olive oil\" interest went viral. Four recruiters shared their reactions with Business Insider.",
    "fullText": "Some people like reading or long walks. Others like olive oil.\n\nBut would you list olive oil as an interest on your résumé? That's the latest internet debate after a post about the interests section on résumés went viral on X.\n\nThe person, who said they were reviewing résumés for a banking role, wrote that applicants needed to be \"normal\" and \"well adjusted.\"\n\n\"I reviewed a resume that listed 'olive oil' as an interest. That is not an interest,\" they wrote. \"It's been hours and I cannot stop thinking about it. There will not be an interview.\"\n\nThe identity of the X user, @90daysliquidity, isn't clear, but they list \"Tech Analyst\" in their bio. They did not respond to a direct message from Business Insider.\n\nCannot stress how much of an advantage it is to be a normal, well adjusted, applicant for banking roles. \n\nI reviewed a resume that listed “olive oil” as an interest. That is not an interest. It’s been hours and I cannot stop thinking about it. There will not be an interview.\n\nThe post caused a stir online. Memes abound, both celebrating and scoffing at the supposed olive oil-enjoyer.\n\nAn employee at Elon Musk's xAI commented that they would hire a \"cracked finance professional\" who is interested in olive oil.\n\n\"If you have olive oil as an interest on your resume, we want to talk to you,\" the official Coinbase account posted.\n\nIs it really so bad to list \"olive oil\" — or any offbeat hobby — on your résumé? Business Insider asked five recruiters what they thought.\n\nPaula Mathias Fryer would want to see just one more word added.\n\nThe SLO Partners senior director from California has been a technical recruiter for 15 years. She would have preferred olive oil \"taster\" or \"grower,\" she told Business Insider.\n\n\"It would have explained it a bit more,\" she said. \"Just those two words is a bit odd.\"\n\nBrianne Sterling, a New York-based director at Selby Jennings who leads investment banking recruitment, also wants more information. Are they just eating olive oil all day long?\n\n\"Do you make your own olive oil?\" Sterling said. \"If someone made their own olive oil, I would find that really interesting, and I might want to speak to them.\"\n\nSterling is a fan of chocolate, but doesn't plan on putting it on her résumé anytime soon.\n\nHobbies offer a common interest between the applicant and the hirer, Sterling said. She listed some popular ones in investment banking: football, basketball, travel, and World War II history.\n\nIt poses a question: what makes a good résumé hobby?\n\nThe off-limits topics are more obvious: politics, religion, anything you wouldn't talk about at the dinner table. Picking the best hobby, on the other hand, depends on the recruiter.\n\nMargaret Buj, a London-based principal recruiter at Mixmax, wants candidates to be interesting. Olive oil was \"weird\" to her — but better than the answers that are \"cliché and vague.\"\n\n\"Traveling, socializing, reading,\" Buj said. \"Who cares? We all do that.\"\n\nSpace on a one-page résumé is a precious resource. Hobbies don't display relevant work experience, and they don't directly show what your contribution to the team would be. Is it even worth listing them?\n\nMathias-Fryer used to vote no. She saw hobbies as \"less professional,\" an unnecessary waste of space. Then came AI, which has upended recruitment and filled hiring managers' inboxes with identical, ChatGPT-generated CVs.\n\nApplicants now need to do \"whatever they can do to stand out,\" she said. \"If that's a hobby, so be it.\"\n\nMatt Stevenson disagrees. The New York-based managing director of executive search agency 33eleven loves to see a quirky hobby. It's another thing to connect about, he said. But, on the candidate side, Stevenson thought that hobbies were too risky.\n\n\"You don't know who is going to be reviewing that résumé, what their hobbies are, and what their personality is like,\" he said.\n\nAs for that X user, endlessly thinking about the olive oil-loving applicant?\n\n\"I would pick up the phone and call the guy,\" he said. \"Scratch that itch.\"",

    "title": "There's a lot of private-credit money chasing the biggest deals. This $7 billion manager is going after 'funkier stuff.'",
    "description": "The manager opened up an evergreen private credit fund to new capital at the start of the year.",
    "fullText": "There's a flood of money rushing to the biggest deals in private-credit land, and it's starting to squeeze returns for the end investors.\n\nIn recent years, managers like BlackRock, Ares, D.E. Shaw, Blackstone, and others have raised massive funds, acquired long-standing private debt players, and launched new units to lend to companies and projects, with many focusing on infrastructure, both physical and digital.\n\nBut that much competition for deals means lendees, not lenders, have their pick of a partner and can negotiate for more favorable terms, which has tamped down return expectations for the asset class.\n\nPrivate credit was the hottest asset class with institutional investors just two years ago, but has since had declining interest due to concerns about rising default risk, according to a recent Goldman Sachs survey of hedge fund allocators.\n\nAnd yet, despite these emerging headwinds, alternative asset manager New Holland Capital is deciding to open its private credit strategy, called Special Opportunities, to new cash.\n\nThe reason: \"We're seeing no spread compression in deals we are looking at,\" said Andrew Parchman, a partner at the firm.\n\nWhile big-name direct lending strategies run by the industry's titans might be feeling pinched, \"there's a lot less erosion\" in the \"funkier things\" the firm's smaller strategy looks at, said Scott Radke, the firm's co-chief investment officer.\n\nNew Holland, which began as an investment advisor for Dutch pension plans before spinning off, now manages close to $7 billion across liquid and illiquid bets, including stakes in external hedge funds and a new group of internal traders.\n\nThe firm has been running its Special Opportunities strategy for its long-standing Dutch clients since 2020 and opened it to new money for the first time at the start of the new year. It's an evergreen fund that looks to turn over its positions relatively quickly and has interested family offices \"who might be a little skeptical of direct lending,\" Radke said.\n\n\"It's not the same investment that it used to be several years ago,\" Radke said about the standard direct lending strategy that private credit is known for. Data from With Intelligence shows that LPs don't have the same appetite for the space's bread-and-butter as they once did; in 2025, direct lending strategies raised $106 billion, compared to $141.8 billion in 2024.\n\nThe focus for New Holland is on deals or events that aren't scalable or repeatable, meaning they fall under the radar of the biggest players, Parchman said. The strategy is seeking quicker \"bridge-style deals\" and will partner with specialty funds on one-off deals, he said. In 2025, the firm both deployed and realized over $250 million across the strategy.\n\nThe manager will lend to deals that offer both tangible and intangible assets as collateral — think a fleet of private jets or the intellectual property of a new prescription drug in trial phase — as well as time-sensitive deals and quirky partnership opportunities sourced through the firm's network.\n\nAny slowdown in private credit fundraising due to jitters about the credit landscape will give players like New Holland more say on deal terms, Parchman believes.\n\n\"You're even less likely to get tourists coming in,\" he said.\n\nCorrection: January 30, 2026: The article has been updated to remove Millennium. The firm does not run a direct lending strategy.",

    "title": "I stopped making New Year's resolutions. I take a trip first — then reset my life in February.",
    "description": "In previous years, Sinead Mulhern had set ambitious goals on January 1, only to abandon them weeks later.",
    "fullText": "In January 2024, I arrived at a friend's farmhouse in Costa Rica. It was the start of a six-week stay that kicked off what I intended to be a year packed with international travel. Stops back home in Canada, and a trip to Argentina had already been penciled in.\n\nAt the time, I didn't realize that moving forward, that trip would quietly replace New Year's resolutions altogether.\n\nFor those six weeks, I settled into rural rhythms. I woke just as the sunlight turned golden, watching green parrots glide overhead. I visited a ranch where locals rode horses and practiced lassoing. I ran up steep country roads, ate the area's famous chicharrón (a success), and tried to milk a cow (a colossal failure).\n\nThe experience was phenomenal. But one evening, as I cooked a simple meal in San José, a pang of homesickness hit me. I found myself thinking about my chosen home of Cuenca, Ecuador — the familiar parks, my apartment, my regular running route.\n\nThe more I thought about it, the clearer it became: My wanderlust had been satisfied. I wasn't craving reinvention. Instead, I was ready to return home.\n\nThat January trip set the tone for my year more effectively than any New Year's resolution ever had. I returned to Cuenca with clarity and spent the year deepening my roots there. I made new friends, took up Pilates, and built a routine that felt grounding rather than restless.\n\nIn previous years, I'd set ambitious goals on January 1, only to abandon them weeks later — foggy from holiday excess and disconnected from what I actually wanted.\n\nThis time was different. By stepping away first, I stopped obsessing over starting somewhere new and learned how to recognize the difference between restlessness and genuine curiosity.\n\nThe trip was so clarifying that I decided to make it a habit. I now schedule a trip at the beginning of each year and wait to reflect on my goals afterward.\n\nLast year, that reset meant spending time on Ecuador's coast. I rented a small cabin and focused on writing projects. I developed a list of story ideas, wrote several essays, and sold them over the course of the year.\n\nWith distance from my regular routine, I gained perspective — and a renewed appreciation for the life I'd already chosen.\n\nThere's a strong case to be made that travel can be a better catalyst for clear goal-setting than the disorienting comedown that follows a month of social overload, overspending, late nights, and heavy food.\n\nIf your 2026 resolution has already fizzled — and most do — it may not be a discipline problem so much as a timing one. The year is still young, and clarity doesn't always arrive on January 1.\n\nTravel is how I start the year with intention, but I'm not talking about lavish vacations or luxury hotels. Unless you can afford that, in which case — love that for you.\n\nTravel can feel lofty or far-fetched if you let it. Or it can be practical and affordable with a little creativity.\n\nDuring my Costa Rica stay, I lived with a friend and split costs on road trips. In Ecuador, I rented a small cabin for $250 a month.\n\nJust days after welcoming 2026, I packed trekking poles into my backpack and boarded a bus headed north in Ecuador.\n\nFor three days, my brother and I trekked through small Andean towns, walking across terrain where potato crops cling defiantly to craggy cliffs and women in crisp hats tend to flocks of bleating sheep. We climbed along the edge of a gorge that splits this part of the Andes in two.\n\nWe barely passed another person as we made our way toward a volcano that holds a turquoise lake deep inside its crater.\n\nSomewhere along a green ridgeline, my focus for the year crystallized. I knew I needed more of this — more adventure, more nature, more challenge — and far less of what didn't come close.\n\nThat's why I no longer try to reinvent my life on January 1. I let the year speak to me first. By the time February arrives, I'm not chasing resolutions, I'm responding to clarity I've already earned.",

    "description": "Tesla is giving the Model S and Model X the ax. Recent sales figures help explain why.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is taking its Model S and Model X to pasture.\n\nThe automaker will end production of the $94,990 sedan and $99,990 SUV next quarter, CEO Elon Musk said on Wednesday's earnings call.\n\nBased on recent delivery numbers, the decision isn't particularly surprising.\n\nTesla does not break out Model S and Model X sales individually; instead, it groups them with the Cybertruck under \"other models.\" Still, earnings presentations suggest demand for the category has been declining for years.\n\nIn 2025, Tesla sold 50,850 \"other model\" units worldwide — accounting for just over 3% of the automaker's 1,636,129 sales.\n\nThe \"other model\" figures are also down sharply from prior years. Tesla sold 85,133 vehicles in the category in 2024 — the first full year of Cybertruck deliveries.\n\nThat means sales fell about 40% in 2025, far steeper than the roughly 7% declines for the Model 3 and Model Y.\n\nThe soon-to-be-discontinued cars will remain an important part of Tesla's history. The Model S, launched in 2012, was the automaker's first car built from the ground up. The Model X came three years later, giving the company a foothold in America's best-selling vehicle category, the SUV.\n\nThe Model X has faced reliability issues from the jump. The car's sweeping gullwing doors were difficult to mass assemble, Musk said, calling the vehicle a \"Fabergé egg\" during a 2019 earnings call.\n\nAnd while Tesla refreshed much of its lineup in 2025, the Model S and Model X received comparatively modest design updates — a contrast with the more aggressive changes to the Model 3 and Model Y.\n\nInstead of chasing a revival of the aging car's sales, Tesla said it is discontinuing the program's production in favor of its Optimus humanoid robot. Musk projects building one million bots a year.\n\n\"It's time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we're really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,\" Musk said, adding that the decision was \"slightly sad.\"\n\nThe move underscores how far Tesla has shifted away from its legacy luxury models as growth slows and Musk pushes the company toward robotics and autonomy.\n\nStill, analysts aren't fully sold on the idea that Tesla's manufacturing switch-up will lead to immediate profits or sales results.\n\n\"The company appears to be on track with the rollout of Robotaxi service in nine US cities, alongside the start of production for the Cybercab and Semi,\" Steve Man, the senior auto industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Business Insider. \"But we believe a commercially ready Optimus robot remains at least a couple of years away.\"\n\nTesla didn't respond to Business a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Dan Priest, PwC's chief AI officer, told Business Insider that companies should focus on quality not quantity when it comes to AI agents.",
    "fullText": "The AI race can sometimes feel like a numbers game.\n\nEarlier this month, Bob Sternfels, the CEO of McKinsey & Company, made a surprising announcement. The firm, he said, had a workforce of over 60,000 people — 40,000 human employees and 25,000 AI agents.\n\nFor Sternfels, it was an example of McKinsey's all-in approach to AI. Others in the industry, however, say the eye-popping number actually says little about the company's successful adoption of artificial intelligence.\n\nDan Priest, the chief AI officer at PwC, told Business Insider that evaluating a firm's AI use by the number of agents it has is not the best metric.\n\n\"There was this emerging bragging right around the number of agents I had or I have in production,\" he said. \"I think that's probably the wrong measure.\"\n\nThe value of AI deployment is better measured by the quality — not the quantity — of agents, he said.\n\nHe said one way to do that is to look at the number of agents that are authorities on a given task, which will encourage humans to use them, Priest said. The other is to evaluate the number of humans using those agents to execute tasks to achieve a prioritized outcome for a company. An example could be a better customer experience by transforming a call center.\n\nOver the past two years, agents have come to dominate how companies talk about AI adoption. Priest said that focus on agents is the right approach. \"Agents are at a place now where they're the best way to unlock value from AI,\" he said.\n\nHumans still drive the workforce, however, and a better way to measure an agent's value is by how effectively people use them — not just by how much work the agents have the potential to automate.\n\nAt PwC, about 82% of its employees were actively using the firm's AI tools. Priest said that AI agents are embedded across teams at PwC, and the firm tracks how agents interact, how accurately they complete tasks, whether they are making processes faster, higher quality, or higher performing. Humans have a role in reviewing agents' output and providing feedback.\n\n\"The human is still accountable,\" he said. \"The humans are the ones who get certified. The humans are the ones who get licensed. The humans are the ones who get empowered.\"\n\nPriest said that PwC and its clients first took a bottom-up approach to AI adoption. Many business leaders, he said, tried to \"crowdsource\" approaches to adoption from employees because they themselves didn't have the answers.\n\nThat led to a \"fairly disappointing\" return on investment, he said.\n\nPriest said a shift to a \"top-down\" approach has been more effective, allowing them to focus on fewer agents with a deeper mastery of a smaller set of tasks.\n\n\"That agent, I've given them permission to access certain data sets,\" he said. \"I've given them permission to perform certain tasks. I've given them permission to produce certain outcomes. Those permissions are monitored, they expire, they're managed.\"",

    "fullText": "A leaked Amazon Web Services organizational chart shows the 15 executives under CEO Matt Garman, plus changes to his reports over the past year.\n\nAWS is Amazon's massive cloud-computing unit. Garman, a longtime Amazon veteran, began leading in June 2024 after running sales and marketing. AWS teams were among those impacted by the company's recent mass layoff targeting 16,000 employees.\n\nBusiness Insider wrote about Garman's org chart a year ago. A comparison to the previous org chart shows the six new executives who became his reports, the 10 executives who stayed on his org chart, and the two executives who left since January 2025.\n\nBrad Bonnett, VP, Technical Advisor:\n\nBonnett is an Amazon boomerang who rejoined the company in 2024 after a two-year stint at Google. Bonnett is Garman's new technical advisor. Laura Grit was listed as technical advisor in Garman's January 2025 org chart.\n\nChet Kapoor, VP, Security Services and Observability:\n\nKapoor joined Amazon in October from his previous post as CEO and chairman of DataStax, an AI data company acquired by IBM last year.\n\nG2 Krishnamoorthy, VP, AWS Database Services:\n\nKrishnamoorthy runs database services, including Redshift and Aurora. He joined Amazon in 2022 from Meta, where he was most recently head of AI infrastructure.\n\nDavid Brown, VP, AWS Compute & ML Services, EC2:\n\nBrown is a nearly 19-year Amazon veteran who runs services including Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud, or EC2, intended to allow customers to easily scale up and down their cloud usage on AWS using virtual servers.\n\nMai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec, VP, AWS Tech:\n\nTomsen Bukovec joined AWS in 2010 and is a high-profile executive at Amazon, known for running key services, including Simple Storage Service (S3), the first cloud service AWS introduced.\n\nSwami Sivasubramanian, VP, Agentic AI:\n\nSivasubramanian became head of Agentic AI in March 2025 and is known for launching popular AI platforms, including Amazon SageMaker and Bedrock.\n\nPrasad Kalyanaraman, VP, AWS Infrastructure Service:\n\nKalyanaraman has spent more than 20 years at Amazon and took over infrastructure and network services in 2021. Kalyanaraman, in an internal memo viewed by Business Insider after the company announced plans to lay off 16,000 employees, wrote that his org in the past year has \"made tremendous progress on scaling to meet unprecedented customer demand.\"\n\nColleen Aubrey, SVP, AWS Applied AI Solutions:\n\nAubrey has spent more than 20 years at Amazon but switched to AWS in May, around the time ex-AWS CEO Adam Selipsky left. She leads the AWS unit responsible for business applications. Aubrey is a member of Jassy's S-team. A calendar invite sent on behalf of Aubrey this week shared details about the company's layoff plans before they were announced.\n\nElizabeth Baker, VP, Private Pricing:\n\nBaker has been at Amazon since 2016 and runs the unit responsible for custom agreements between AWS and customers, including terms such as usage-based discounts. Baker's past roles include positions at SAP and Oracle.\n\nGreg Pearson, VP, AWS Global Sales:\n\nAfter Garman became CEO, Pearson integrated global sales teams under Pearson, combining AWS Global Sales, Worldwide Public Sector, the Greater China Region, and Sales Strategy and Operations.\n\nJulia White, VP, Worldwide AWS Marketing:\n\nWhite joined AWS in November 2025. She was most recently the chief marketing and solutions officer at SAP. Before that, she spent nearly two decades at Microsoft in roles including corporate vice president of product marketing for the Azure cloud unit.\n\n\"Julia will join my leadership team and further develop and execute our global marketing strategy, playing a pivotal part in AWS's growth,\" Garman wrote in an email announcing her appointment.\n\nLaura Grit, VP/Distinguished Engineer:\n\nGrit, an 18-year Amazon veteran, is Garman's previous technical advisor. She previously led Amazon.com's migration from on-premise data centers to AWS cloud services.\n\nRuba Borno, VP, AWS Specialists & Partners:\n\nBorno has been at AWS since 2021. When Garman took over, he put Borno in charge of a new unit combining its Channels and Alliances team, responsible for relationships between global partners and customers, and its Worldwide Specialist Organization, which connects service teams to customers.\n\nUwem Ukpong, VP, AWS Industries:\n\nUkpong now leads the organization responsible for industry-specific AWS products for customers, succeeding Kathrin Renz, who left in December.\n\nVogels is technically the chief technology officer of Amazon overall, but he has another important role within AWS, acting as one of the public faces of the company's cloud business and technical infrastructure.\n\nMissing from Garman's latest organizational chart are Peter DeSantis, previously listed as senior vice president of AWS Utility Computing, and Kathrin Renz, ex-VP of AWS Industries. DeSantis, this month, took on a new role overseeing a new AI organization, and Renz left the company in December, according to a LinkedIn post.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Michael Fiddelke takes over the Target CEO job on Sunday. He must deal with declining sales and civil unrest in the retailer's hometown, Minneapolis.",
    "fullText": "Target's new CEO won't get a honeymoon period.\n\nMichael Fiddelke, the company's chief operating officer who started as a finance intern, is taking over at a moment when the retailer is under pressure on nearly every front, grappling with a weakening business, political backlash, and growing employee strain.\n\nFiddelke, who officially takes the helm this weekend, will have to contend with 10 of the past 12 quarters having flat or declining comparable sales, as civil unrest unfolds in Minneapolis, where Target is headquartered. Target's stock is down more than 25% in the past year.\n\nPeter Schwartz, a CEO coach of 20 years, told Business Insider that Fiddelke is facing a classic leadership paradox. He must balance sensitivity to a politically and socially charged moment with the non-negotiable responsibility of running a business.\n\n\"This is incredibly complex,\" said Schwartz, particularly if turning Target's fortunes around and improving employee relations calls for significant changes.\n\nA Target spokesperson declined to comment on this story.\n\nBeyond its financial struggles, Target has lost a lot of the goodwill and cultural appeal that once differentiated it from other big-box chains. After more than two decades on Fortune's list of 50 most admired companies, Target did not make the cut this year, even as competitors like Walmart and Costco landed in the top 10.\n\nFiddelke knows he has his work cut out for him. During the August earnings call after his promotion was announced, the incoming chief laid out a three-point plan to get Target back in the good graces of US shoppers: lean into Target's style bona fides, improve the in-store experience, and invest more heavily in technology.\n\n\"I'm stepping into the role with a clear and urgent commitment to build new momentum in the business and get back to profitable growth,\" he said.\n\nBut relations with Target's workforce and local communities have also been under strain, with several employees telling Business Insider that they are disappointed in the company's response to immigration enforcement activity in Minneapolis.\n\nLast week, hundreds of Target employees signed a letter urging the company to bar ICE from its stores and outlined other steps they want the company to take in response to ICE's actions.\n\nTaking the company in a new direction and implementing big changes will require Fiddelke to win over enough board members to support his vision for Target's future. This could be tricky because the board promoted Fiddelke while keeping longtime CEO Brian Cornell on as executive chairman, essentially preserving the status quo in Target's leadership.\n\nFormer Target Vice Chairman Gerald Storch told Business Insider that when a company takes on a new leader, the outgoing CEO should leave within about six months to make way for change.\n\n\"Otherwise, the new CEO is CEO in name only and doesn't have an opportunity to really thrive and exercise his own will,\" Storch, who left Target's board in 2005, said.\n\nTarget under Cornell's tenure delivered some strong business results while also championing progressive and inclusive issues, such as LGBTQ+ Pride and Black-owned businesses. Cornell also spoke out forcefully after the murder of George Floyd in 2020, saying that Floyd \"could have been one of my Target team members.\"\n\nBut as Target's financial performance faltered, the retailer retreated from social controversies, scaling back summer Pride collections and winding down some corporate DEI initiatives. The company also made its largest political donation, a $1 million contribution to Donald Trump's 2025 presidential inauguration fund.\n\nWith roughly 50 Target stores in the Twin Cities metro area and its headquarters in Minneapolis, Target has also been dragged into a national political firestorm. Corporate leadership did not comment publicly after federal agents detained two employees at an area store, as then-Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino marched through another with a heavily armed entourage, and as Target parking lots were used as ad hoc staging and detainee transfer sites.\n\nAfter a second Minneapolis resident was killed Saturday by Border Patrol, Fiddelke addressed employees Monday. He said in a video message that the recent violence and loss of life in the community \"is incredibly painful.\"\n\nLeadership experts told Business Insider this was the right move, but that Fiddelke faces a tough road ahead. He needs to stabilize the business, honor the rule of law, and still acknowledge that employees and communities are under real stress, said Jennifer Eggers, president of executive advisory firm LeaderShift Insights in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"If he over-indexes on ideology, he risks fragmenting the brand and the workforce. If he ignores the human tension entirely, he risks disengagement and erosion of trust,\" she said. \"Strong leaders navigate the middle with clarity and credibility and involve employees in the dialogue.\"\n\nDespite the headwinds, Fiddelke has some things working in his favor.\n\nCEO insiders tend to produce better results than their external counterparts, according to a 2025 Yale study of leadership transitions at Fortune 500 companies over the past five years. The findings show that CEO successors from inside delivered higher total shareholder returns than those from outside at the one-, three-, and five-year marks.\n\nNot only is Fiddelke a longtime Target employee, but he also has family ties to the Minneapolis community, which are advantages because they give him credibility, said Sarah Federman, associate professor of conflict resolution at the University of San Diego's Kroc School of Peace Studies.\n\nThose attributes signal to the company's workforce: \"I'm one of you, and I've been here a long time and so work with me,\" she said.\n\nFederman sees crises as opportunities for leaders to build or reinforce relationships with stakeholders by using words or actions that show support.\n\n\"This emotional security and feeling that your company has your back is going to matter,\" Federman said. \"It could create real company spirit.\"\n\nFiddelke could go even further by temporarily shutting down Target stores in Minneapolis or other areas where immigration agents are active, she said. \"That's a huge cost, but that would show his commitment to their employees,\" Federman said.\n\nStill, any radical moves could put Target in Trump's crosshairs, said Don Moore, a professor at the University of California-Berkeley's Haas School of Business who researches confidence. He described the incoming CEO's message to employees this week as a small act of bravery.\n\n\"It may be a sign that Fiddelke is finding his own voice,\" said Moore.",

    "description": "If you're looking to put some money to work in markets right now, Vanguard says it's generally a good idea to lean into bonds.",
    "fullText": "If you're looking to put some money to work in markets right now, Vanguard says it's a good idea to lean into bonds.\n\nIn fact, the asset management giant says the ideal portfolio at the moment is 60% bonds and 40% stocks, flipping the traditional advice for asset allocation.\n\nOf course, the ideal portfolio is different for each investor based on risk tolerance and timeline. But given where bond yields and stock valauations sit, bonds look like the more attractive of the two asset classes right now, says Kevin Khang, a senior global economist at Vanguard.\n\n\"Take the perspective seriously, but not literally,\" Khang said in commentary published on January 22. \"Our strategic allocation of 40% stocks and 60% bonds reflects our own assumptions about investment horizons, long-term capital market return projections, and risk tolerance.\"\n\nKhang's lackluster view on stocks stems from the AI boom seen over the last few years. While he still thinks stocks can outperform in the year ahead, high valuations driven by endless AI enthusiasm are likely to dampen long-term returns, as has historically been the case.\n\n\"Today's US equity market is led by a narrow group of mega‑cap technology companies and other rising stars spending hundreds of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure,\" Khang said. \"Many of these firms have extraordinary earnings power but also historically elevated valuations. Past high‑valuation, innovation-driven investment cycles offer a surprisingly consistent pattern: While real technological progress often follows historic investment cycles, long-term returns often fall short of historical averages.\"\n\nVanguard's upward-adjusted fair value levels show today's stock valuations rival those seen in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year Treasury yields sit at around 4.22% — offering robust income and plenty of cushion for appreciation if investors were to seek safety in bonds amid a stock-market pullback.\n\nDespite laying out his flipped 60/40 vision, Khang emphasized that his commentary shouldn't be taken as a recommendation to adopt such a portfolio construction immediately. Instead, one can start moving in such a direction as they put new money to work.\n\n\"Instead of treating the recommendation as a binary 'switch,' we suggest thinking in terms of direction and pacing,\" Khang said. \"Start with the next dollar. For investors still accumulating assets, this means directing new contributions toward the preferred allocation.\"",

    "title": "How the weakest dollar in 4 years could undercut the relief everyday Americans get from Trump's affordability push",
    "description": "Trump said the US dollar is doing \"great,\" but a weaker currency could undercut his attempts to boost affordability for Americans.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump says he's not in a rush to pump up America's sagging currency. Yet, that could be the very thing that comes back to bite his big affordability push, according to market pros, who say a weaker dollar could soon get in the way of the president's goal of lowering borrowing costs.\n\nTrump, who has made lowering borrowing costs a key goal of his second term, suggested he wasn't too pressed about the greenback's decline when speaking to reporters in Iowa this week.\n\n\"The dollar's doing great,\" Trump said, adding that he wanted the greenback to \"seek its own level\" — comments that sent the currency tumbling further to a four-year low.\n\nThe president has praised a weaker dollar before.\n\nLast year, he floated it as a positive, suggesting US firms could \"make a hell of a lot more money\" due to exports being more attractive broadly to foreign buyers.\n\nThe US Dollar Index, which weighs the dollar against a basket of other major currencies, is down around 10% over the past year, thanks to pressures like some investors shifting away from dollar-based assets and the Fed continuing its rate-cutting cycle.\n\nThere's just one problem: a weaker dollar doesn't bode well when it comes to making the case to lower interest rates. That's because a weaker currency lowers Americans' purchasing power abroad and could raise the cost of imported goods. Higher inflation could ultimately cause interest rates to rise — the opposite of what Trump is shooting for.\n\nJoe Kalish, a chief macro strategist at Ned Davis Research, said he believed the \"collapsing\" dollar could be Trump's \"Achilles' heel.\"\n\n\"If the new Fed Chair tries to push through a rate cut as soon as the June meeting, FX traders could smell blood in the water and punish the dollar, sending inflation expectations higher and worsening household affordability,\" Kalish wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.\n\nHe added that a soft dollar could result in a \"lose-lose\" situation when it came to lowering rates, even if Trump were to plug in a trusted ally as Fed Chair.\n\nA weaker dollar is also tied to the \"Sell America\" trade, the idea that investors are shifting away from US assets due to a worsening economic outlook. Investors dumping US bonds is part of that trade, something that would also cause yields to rise.\n\n\"The bond vigilantes would return and demand a higher term premium, forcing yields higher,\" Kalish added, referring to the potential for bond investors to stage a sell-off in government bonds as concerns rise over inflation, causing rates to rise in tandem.\n\nThe 10-year US Treasury yield, a key benchmark for other lending rates, was around 4.24% on Thursday, up two basis points this week. The move coincided with a 0.6 decline in the US Dollar Index over the same period.\n\nMore forecasters have been flagging the risk of higher yields due to a bond market revolt. Nela Richardson, the chief economist of ADP, said a weaker dollar could get in the way of the US's ability to sell Treasury bonds.\n\n\"A weak dollar at home doesn't always have the confidence of markets. And that confidence is going to be very important as we look at other things that are a struggle for the US economy, like sticky inflation, like high deficits and debts, and the need to sell treasuries,\" Richardson said.\n\nShe called a falling US dollar a \"double-edged sword\" when it came to Trump's economic agenda.\n\nRobert Kaplan, Goldman Sachs' vice chairman, also pointed out that a weak dollar would affect demand in the Treasury market.\n\n\"The United States has $39 trillion of debt on its way to $40 trillion plus,\" Kaplan said. \"I actually think the US is going to want to see a stable dollar and wants to see stability. And they want to be able to sell the long end of the Treasury curve. A stable dollar helps,\" he added.",

    "title": "Ukrainian troops were 'stunned' to learn their British trainers don't use anti-drone nets, UK officer says",
    "description": "Ukrainian soldiers getting combat training from the UK are feeding back key modern warfare lessons that the British Army is adopting.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian soldiers were shocked to learn that anti-drone nets weren't standard for the British Army when they came over for combat training, a UK officer told Business Insider.\n\nLt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion of the UK's Irish Guards — an infantry regiment with a long operational history — said he had never seen nets to stop drones used in his 20 years in the army.\n\n\"The Ukrainians were absolutely stunned,\" he said. For the Ukrainians, he shared, the view is \"well, of course you put nets over your positions because that's how you defend yourself.\"\n\nDrones have become ubiquitous in Ukraine and are behind most battlefield strikes, forcing both sides to protect personnel and weaponry from constant airborne threats.\n\nDefenses include low-cost options like nets, which can snag propellers and prevent drones from reaching their targets, be they soldiers or high-value equipment. Soldiers stretch the counter-drone nets over their fortified positions, weapon systems, and armored vehicles. The Ukrainians have also covered key roadways with netting to protect supply routes.\n\nUkrainians have been gathering up netting wherever they can find it to meet demand, even from the fishing villages of partner nations.\n\nThe Ukrainians told their British trainers they needed to get nets, and the UK military reacted fast, Irwin-Clark said.\n\n\"We went 'round every fishing port in the east of England asking for their old fishing nets,\" the officer shared, \"and we've now got hundreds and hundreds of meters of fishing nets, which we drape over positions when we conduct training.\"\n\n\"Are they exactly the right type of drone nets? Dunno,\" he said. \"But in terms of replicating it for training, that's the best we can do. It's entirely free, and it's a lesson we learned entirely from our Ukrainian brothers and sisters.\"\n\nHe said it was \"just one example\" of how Ukrainian front-line experience has shaped British training, with lessons passed on by soldiers arriving directly from combat and rapidly folded into UK doctrine.\n\nThe Irish Guards gained much of that insight during the deployment to Operation Interflex, the UK-led training program that has supported more than 62,000 Ukrainian soldiers, including both new recruits and combat veterans.\n\nSpeaking at a training demo recently attended by Business Insider, Irwin-Clark said that \"it's really inspiring working with the Ukrainians and training Ukrainians, and I think what I hadn't anticipated over a year ago when we started our stint on Interflex is how much we would learn.\"\n\nThe Operation Interflex training is meant to share Western and NATO doctrine with Ukrainian forces to help them fend off Russia's invasion. The exchange, however, has increasingly run both ways, with the UK armed forces modifying aspects of its own training based on Ukrainian input.\n\nUkraine is fighting a large-scale, high-intensity war against a major military power, something the UK and other Western forces have not experienced in decades. As a result, Ukrainian troops often have more recent, firsthand insight into what works, particularly in areas like drone warfare and trench fighting.\n\nBritish trainers say the dynamic works. Col. Boardman, the commanding officer for Operation Interflex, previously told Business Insider that there is a \"really rich mutual understanding going on\" and that the training \"ends up with the sum being much greater than the parts, which is really valuable for us.\" He spoke on the requirement that only his rank and last name be used.\n\nUkrainian soldiers, he said, might explain why a NATO-style tactic is likely to fail under real-world combat conditions and what they do instead. That knowledge is then combined with Western doctrine and used to refine training on both sides. The UK, for instance, adjusted its thinking on how trench battles are fought in response to Ukrainian combat experiences.\n\n\"We are learning an awful lot from our engagement with this war,\" Boardman said.\n\nHe said Ukraine places a lot of value on NATO and Western military doctrine because while \"they may have the current battle experience,\" the Ukrainians \"know that we have some of the history, some of the hard-won experience of this in the past.\"\n\nThe feedback shared during Operation Interflex also prompted the Irish Guards to make other changes, including investing heavily in drone warfare.\n\nIt has since created a new \"drone hub,\" the first of its kind in the British Army, where soldiers can repair drones and develop new ones, and train for drone warfare. It uses tech like 3D printing, a technology adopted on Ukrainian advice.\n\nIrwin-Clark said that out of the 300 people in the battalion, 78 are now pilots or instructors. Speaking at the training demonstration, he described drones as part of \"the future of warfare.\"\n\nOthers within the British Army have acknowledged Ukraine's help in developing the UK's drone warfare capabilities. Boardman, for example, highlighted drones as an area where Ukrainian troops have far more direct experience. \"They are very good at sharing the understanding with us,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on an interview with Noe Parenteau, 80, who lives outside Fort Myers, Florida. Parenteau works as an operations automation analyst and wishes he had more money to pay for his loved ones' medical care. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was considering retiring after I turned 80, but the cost of geriatric care is high. My sister and ex-wife both require care. My sister is in full-time memory care, and my ex-wife has needed more care over the past two years after a dementia diagnosis, so I decided to keep working.\n\nI'm trying to help support them, whether it's paying the care facility directly or paying them to provide some support or outside nurses. I'm not contributing too much right now. It's a tag team with my family to check up on them.\n\nI'm doing fine financially, but I don't really know if I would ever retire because I tried it once, and I was just sitting around doing nothing other than volunteer work. I have a good job and get overtime, which helps me set aside some money for other geriatric care we might need.\n\nI'm also a grandfather. My grandkids bring me great joy, even though I don't see them enough.\n\nI began my career in computer operations, handling peripheral equipment, before moving into a more software engineering support role. I moved to a bank in a supervisory role, took a buyout there, then worked at a data analytics company for 10 years. By then, I was in my 50s, so I took a three-year sabbatical.\n\nI worked a few other jobs in computer operations and project management after that. I took on a technical lead position, which is where I am right now. Also, I'm collecting pensions from a few businesses I worked with years ago, as well as Social Security.\n\nMy sister is in memory care, which costs around $7,000 a month.\n\nMy ex-wife also receives care. We were married for 17 years and divorced, but my four daughters have kept us all together as one group. Two of my daughters handle her finances and any regular interactions with the doctors. My ex-wife is a breast cancer survivor, and she continued to work as long as she could. But over the last two years, her health has gone sideways.\n\nMy daughters are really on the ball working with her. Her care costs about $5,000 a month. We're trying to keep her in an assisted living facility as long as we can. If we had to move her, the added care would cost as much as $6,000 to $7,000 a month. We do have some money set aside, but we really want to keep her in a nice facility we have confidence in, with fewer visitor restrictions than a memory care facility would.\n\nMy sister and my ex are in Wisconsin, and my daughters live in Minnesota, Chicago, and Milwaukee. Six months ago, I took a trip to Wisconsin to look for a home and relocate, but doing so would mean I would lose some of my earning power because there are more taxes there, and I don't have a car.\n\nI'll probably look into relocating again this summer, but I've come to realize that the best way I can help now is through financial support.\n\nOne of my sister's daughters is very close to her and checks on her regularly. She's earmarked some funds for her mother, and I told her that I could probably bear some of the costs, maybe $2,000 a month to keep her in memory care.\n\nWe're also seeking more Medicare dollars for my sister's support. If my sister's family has to exhaust their funds to support their mother, we may have to rely on the county or other family members who want to help. That's a sharp stick in the eye, especially when raising a family and having kids going to college.\n\nIt seems like this country doesn't spend a lot of money on geriatric care, and that's a sad story for such a wealthy nation.\n\nMy ex-wife's family has been known to live well into their 90s, and she's the same age I am. She could be in memory care for five to 10 years.\n\nIt's good that I can help, but for me to come up with what could be up to $12,000 to $14,000 a month, it would have to come out of my pension, savings, and investments. If I have to do it, I'll do it.\n\nThis is my second sister who has contracted dementia. My other sister was in assisted living and then went into memory care. She passed away about three years ago. My sister now has a lot of anxiety, and sometimes she can't put two and two together and gets frustrated by it. The symptoms of dementia are difficult to deal with unless you've gone through them and been prepared for them.\n\nI fear that the situation with my sister and ex-wife will trickle down to my daughters, so I continue working in case they need assistance if their savings deplete.\n\nI try to talk to my grandkids as much as I can, telling them that when I was their age or younger, most of these people didn't live in an elder care situation. They lived at home often.\n\nMy grandkids and I get together at Christmas, and I try to travel more to see them in the summertime when they're not all in school. Over the past decade or so that I've been living in Florida, I try to go up for an extended period of time, where I can take them to school and see them in their daily lives. I want them to see me as part of their daily lives, too.\n\nI live by myself and don't really go out. I live frugally and try to make sure that my investments and savings are there for any emergency or special occasion, whether it's a graduation or any educational or health issues that may arise. They may need a car or a down payment.\n\nI suspect the money I have set aside for retirement will be diminished over time. I'm reaching a point where I don't think there's going to be much there for me, and I'm sure my daughters would probably take me in. I suspect I'll one day be in the same situation that my sister and ex-wife are in.",

    "description": "Michael Knox runs a restaurant near Minneapolis. He said employees are afraid to come in, and even his regular customers have been absent.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Michael Knox, co-owner of Toma Mojo Grill near Minneapolis. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI run a fast casual chicken restaurant in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb just south of Minneapolis.\n\nWith ICE agents in the area, I don't know when — or if — staff will be able to come to work. We all have pretty set schedules, and we're tight-knit. There are only six of us operating this place, seven days a week. And I have concerns: Are my employees going to get stopped on their way to work? Are they going to be hassled or detained? Are they going to come back?\n\nIt's a day-by-day thing. Over the past couple of weeks, we've adjusted our hours, opening later and closing earlier. I've been picking up everyone's shifts, but I can't physically work 16 hours a day, seven days a week. We had to close last week so that I could have a day off. I had a doctor's appointment that I couldn't miss.\n\nSome of my employees don't feel comfortable leaving their houses. If they tell me they can't come to the restaurant, my policy, of course, is \"no questions asked.\" I get it. But I'm not a wealthy businessman. If we're not serving guests our food, there's no money coming in, and we can't pay people. I wish that we were at a place where we could offer better PTO benefits, but we're not. That's been hard.\n\nWe're just trying to keep our people safe and our employees comfortable. We have a big bay window at the front of the restaurant where the full kitchen is visible. I'm going to make some modifications to the space that will make it harder to see inside. We don't know who's looking in now, or what their purpose is. We put up cameras that we didn't have before — we need to have a record of whatever happens here.\n\nI worry that ICE agents will come to my business to abduct my staff. I also worry that they're going to come enjoy hospitality, and that's going to get out to the public. I can only do what I think is good for me, my staff, and the restaurant. ICE agents are bad for business, no matter which way they come.\n\nLast week, my sales were down about 40% year over year. There are fewer delivery drivers and gig workers, so our takeout food is sitting longer before pickup. Our walk-in business is suffering too: After the sun goes down, we're seeing almost a noticeable drop in sales. That didn't previously happen. Now I have regulars who I haven't seen in weeks.\n\nI went to the strike with my friends and family last week to voice our dissatisfaction with the situation. My employees and I thought it was important to close that day too. Shutting down a restaurant on a Friday in January is devastating. It's the busy day, the day that pays for the rest of the week. That's a big sacrifice — but I know it's important.\n\nWhat's happening in Minneapolis should horrify every American. There's a very real, pervasive fear about what's going to happen next. That's bad for business. That's bad for life. And I'm worried that there's going to be more loss of life.\n\nSmall business owners are brave people. It takes a lot of guts to put everything on the line do something you really want to do, to present a product or service that you think is good enough to charge money for. They don't tend to be the quiet type. I'm not surprised they're speaking up.",

It's simply knowing where your money is.\n\nBefore focusing on growing wealth, Michela Allocca, founder of the personal finance brand Break Your Budget and author of \"Own Your Money,\" says people need a clear picture of what they already have.\n\nHow much money is in your retirement account?

Since quitting, she's quadrupled her income.\n\nOnce you know where you're starting from, you can figure out how much you actually need to reach your goal, whether it's early retirement or becoming work optional.\n\n\"Looking at where your money is really is that first step,\" Allocca said. From there, she recommends using a financial independence calculator to map out realistic targets.\n\nSay you're trying to hit Coast FIRE, an offshoot of the Financial Independence, Retire Early movement, where you no longer need to contribute to your retirement accounts. Instead, the amount you've already invested is expected to grow and compound enough over time to support your retirement, allowing you to \"coast\" into your golden years.\n\n\"You can just go onto Google and very simply search up a financial independence calculator, plug in your numbers, and it will tell you, OK, you need to have, let's say, $250,000 invested in your retirement account by this age in order to reach Coast FIRE,\" she said.\n\nMaybe you're closer to that $250,000 number than you thought, or maybe you've already surpassed it. Whatever the case, now you have a specific goal and know exactly how far away or close you are to reaching it, thanks to your financial audit.\n\nKnowing whether you've hit, or are close to hitting, a milestone like Coast FIRE can be life-changing.\n\n\"You go to work to pay your bills in the present and to save for retirement in the future,\" Allocca said. \"So if you eliminate the need to keep saving for retirement, that opens up an entirely new financial reality for you.\"\n\nSuddenly, you have options. You can continue working your day job and redirect the money you would otherwise save for retirement toward other financial goals. Or, maybe you hate your job, and now, without the pressure to save tens of thousands of dollars a year for retirement, you could pivot to a lower-paying job you actually enjoy or take a sabbatical.\n\nThe problem is that many people never run the numbers.\n\n\"They're not seeing how close they are, or how close they could be with two or three years of diligence,\" she said, adding that she's no exception. \"If I had calculated my numbers years ago, I probably could have either hit these numbers sooner or had a different relationship with my finances. I wouldn't have been reaching for more and more, thinking I'd never have enough, because I would have known.\"",

    "description": "Leaders at Navient and Sallie Mae said that Trump's sweeping student-loan repayment changes will be a boon to their private lending business.",
    "fullText": "Private student-loan companies are gearing up for a big year ahead.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration is preparing to roll out its sweeping student-loan repayment changes beginning in July. Those changes include new repayment plans and caps on federal borrowing for advanced degrees.\n\nSome companies see those changes as an opportunity for the private lending industry. During an earnings call last week, Jonathan Witter, the CEO of lender Sallie Mae, said that the company is \"excited about the opportunity created by the recent federal student lending reforms.\"\n\n\"These changes should reduce the likelihood of students and families taking on unsustainable levels of student debt,\" Witter said. \"These reforms also create the opportunity for us to help more students and families.\"\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation eliminates the Grad PLUS program, which allowed graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs. The legislation also imposes new borrowing caps for graduate and professional students: $20,500 for graduate students and $50,000 for professionals, such as those in medical or law school.\n\nWitter said the company expects those changes to bring in an estimated $5 billion in annual loan originations. Navient's CEO, David Yowan, expressed similar sentiment during the company's earnings call this month. He said that the changes to Grad PLUS are an \"opportunity\" for the company to expand, saying that \"there's a lot of room for growth\" this year.\n\nPrivate lenders have been anticipating these repayment changes for months. Yowan said during an August 2025 earnings call that eliminating the Grad PLUS program is \"a substantial and significant expansion of opportunities that we have with graduate students.\" SoFi's CEO Anthony Noto said at the time that the repayment changes could lead to \"further opportunities for in school lending and student loan refinance.\"\n\nWhile private lenders anticipate boosts to their businesses from Trump's repayment overhaul, some critics and borrowers are concerned. Borrowers could choose to forgo their programs entirely due to more limited federal financing, and if they turn to private lenders, they would lose out on federal debt relief and forgiveness.\n\nSara Partridge, associate director for higher education policy at the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, previously told Business Insider that private student loans could also have higher interest rates than federal loans, leaving borrowers with more unaffordable debt.\n\n\"Private student loans often require a cosigner, so some students may not qualify, and they may have no options to fully finance and attend graduate school. So there is a possibility that for some students, this will be a barrier to accessing graduate school,\" Partridge said.\n\nStill, the Trump administration said the reforms are intended to curb excessive borrowing and increase accountability in the federal system.\n\n\"We are building a future where higher education works for everyone, where students are empowered to succeed, where taxpayers can trust that their investments will be used wisely, and where institutions are held accountable for delivering results,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a January statement.",

    "description": "Wix CEO Avishai Abrahami predicts 70% of the top 20 most popular jobs in the US will be affected by AI in the next five to 10 years.",
    "fullText": "What keeps the CEO of the billion-dollar company Wix up at night? The future of the workforce.\n\n\"I'm really worried about the employment market,\" Avishai Abrahami told Business Insider.\n\nThe CEO said that a \"massive amount\" of roles will shrink due to AI advancement. He predicted that roughly 70% of the top 20 most popular jobs in the US today will be affected by AI over the next five to 10 years.\n\nAbrahami said he's concerned about computers outsmarting humans, a concept often referred to as artificial general intelligence, which some tech leaders have said we have already surpassed in some ways. In that reality, humans \"become the monkeys,\" the CEO said. He said when he grew up, getting to such a point \"was a science-fiction thing,\" and it's now becoming a reality.\n\nAbrahami said he doesn't know whether that future is next week or 10 years from now — but he said it's closer than 15 or 20 years from now.\n\nHowever, AI will also create new opportunities and job types, Abrahami said. For example, Wix just introduced a new role called the xEngineer, described as a design-first engineer with deep domain expertise who uses AI as a key part of every workflow. The position is for a specialist who is \"amplified\" by AI, the company said in its announcement.\n\nAbrahami said some jobs are more at risk than others:\n\nAbrahami said one of the most common jobs in the US — driving for ride-share apps, taxi, and truck drivers — will be affected. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported more than 4 million of those jobs in 2024.\n\nAlphabet's Waymo has already launched self-driving services in multiple cities across the US, and Tesla just launched robotaxi rides without human oversight in Austin, where it has offered the service for several months.\n\nThe CEO said that people working in customer service or call center positions will also be affected. Other tech leaders, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, similarly said that AI will take customer service jobs first.\n\nOther roles, such as software developers and analysts, are already seeing AI reshape their jobs. A Google Cloud report released in September found that AI adoption had surged to 90% among software professionals.\n\nThe CEO predicted that jobs that require human performance or interaction will be a \"bit safer\" from job replacement. Abrahami said that \"nobody cares\" about robots running fast and competing against each other in soccer, and that athletes and other roles in the performing arts will stay.\n\nJobs that require high-level thinking are also performed better by humans than by AI right now with the current models, Abrahami said. The CEO said that AI isn't great at creating new things, and it's unlikely to invent a new science at its current level.\n\nAbrahami said that janitors are also \"probably really safe\" when it comes to replacement because the job requires a lot of handwork, which robots are far from being able to replicate.\n\n\"We are very good at processing visual movement information,\" Abrahami said.\n\nIn general, he said, jobs where humans can shine and bring something that's \"completely unexpected\" will be the areas where they're safe from replacement.",

    "title": "Snowmobiles, skis, and laser tag: How NATO soldiers train for Arctic assaults",
    "description": "Business Insider traveled north of the Arctic Circle to watch Finland's Jaeger Brigade train NATO forces on winter warfare and cold-weather survival.",
    "fullText": "SODANKYLÄ, Finland — Two soldiers moved cautiously through the snow-covered forest, their camouflage blending into the trees as their skis glided silently over the ground.\n\nSpotting an unaware enemy, they knelt and lined up a shot. Rifle fire erupted through the woods, the metallic smell of spent casings hanging in the cold air.\n\nA firefight kicked off, and a battle was underway.\n\nThe encounter took place during a recent winter combat exercise involving roughly 20 NATO troops, beginning with an assault on skis and snowmobiles before shifting into a simulated firefight using blanks and lasers instead of live ammo. The drill was part of a monthlong course led by Finland's Jaeger Brigade that trains allied forces in Arctic warfare and cold-weather survival.\n\nBusiness Insider observed the battle's start at a training site 75 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Finland's snow-blanketed Lapland region. It pitted a small platoon of NATO soldiers against an \"enemy\" force that was three times larger and composed of conscripts from the Jaeger Brigade.\n\nAs the strategic Arctic region becomes increasingly important to both NATO and its adversaries, exercises like this are designed to sharpen allied troops' abilities to fight on frozen battlefields. The environment is harsh and unforgiving, with sub-zero temperatures routine. And while fighting is simulated, it reflects real-world threats.\n\nMaj. Mikael Aikio, the Jaeger Brigade's Arctic section leader overseeing the course, told Business Insider that using lasers makes the training feel more realistic. \"At least there is some kind of fear of getting hit,\" he said.\n\nArctic security has become a focal point for NATO in recent years as Russia and China grow more active in the region, seeking to project power, establish new trade routes, and expand their access to natural resources.\n\nNATO leadership, concerned by certain Russian and Chinese behavior, has stressed the need for greater investment in collective Arctic defense to prevent Moscow and Beijing from gaining more military and economic influence in this strategic area.\n\nFinland — roughly a third of which sits above the Arctic Circle and has a long history of cold-weather combat — is well positioned to train Western forces in Arctic warfare and has led annual courses for more than a decade. That training has taken on new urgency for NATO.\n\nThe training Business Insider observed this week is ongoing, with participants hailing from Finland, the US, the UK, France, Italy, and Canada. The idea is that they can take what they learn in Lapland and use it to instruct or advise their units back home.\n\nThe course is divided into three phases over four weeks, starting with cold-weather survival and winter movement training, then teaching maneuvers such as attacking on skis and building snow foxholes, and ending with low-mountain activity above the tree line.\n\nThe second phase includes the combat exercise Business Insider had the opportunity to observe. The NATO platoon, known as the Blue force, began by crossing several kilometers of forest on snowmobiles before dismounting and skiing to the top of a small hill. Their objective was to effectively assault and capture territory defended by the Red force, the Finnish conscripts.\n\nManeuver in these environments used to be limited to skis, still a crucial tool for soldiers needing to traverse deep snow that otherwise would make ground assaults impossible. Modern snowmobiles lighten the load, allowing soldiers to travel farther faster with less overall effort, preserving energy for the fight.\n\n\"You can't get anywhere,\" said Aikio, the Jaeger Brigade major, said of the snow's effect on traditional assault elements. The Arctic demands some unique warfighting skills that aren't really used anywhere else.\n\nLearning to ski in these conditions can be challenging for soldiers, especially if they have no prior experience. They're also weighed down by cumbersome gear, such as packs, helmets, vests, and guns, making it more difficult.\n\n\"It's hard to move with the skis,\" said Finnish Lt. Laura Lähdekorpi, one of the soldiers in the winter warfare course. She told Business Insider that recreational downhill skiing has helped her to improve balance.\n\nCanadian Cpt. Vincent Lemelin, another soldier in the course, said he grew up skiing; however, the ones he's been using in Finland — long and designed to act as snowshoes — are very different from what he's used to.\n\n\"The fact that the skis are this long requires some adaptation, but it does give an advantage to already have the skills,\" Lemelin said.\n\n\"In this operating condition, even a good skier, at some point, especially at night, will start struggling because you're getting tired,\" he said. \"When you get tired, you're also less confident.\"\n\nThe assault began as daylight faded away. The Blue force used drones to collect targeting data, which it relayed to a nearby control van that then simulated artillery strikes against the Red force. Then the NATO troops advanced toward the Finns.\n\nSoldiers carried rifles loaded with blanks and equipped with transmitters that fire laser tracks when they pull the triggers. They wore vests and helmet straps able to detect any incoming laser signals.\n\nIf a shot found its mark, the vest on the opposing soldier announced to them that they had been \"killed\" or \"wounded,\" depending on where on the body they got hit by the laser. Then they took off their helmets to signal that they were out.\n\nThough the system resembles laser tag, troops take it seriously. It reflects the consequences of armed conflict, forcing soldiers to respond to simulated injuries and sudden losses, much like they would in real combat.\n\n\"If we fight without this, everyone can just walk straight into the woods,\" Lähdekorpi said. There'd be no way to tell if someone was hit or killed. This tech pushes soldiers to hide, move discreetly, and communicate more effectively.\n\nThe laser system isn't a perfect match for combat, Aikio acknowledged. \"If you have snow, or branches, or anything that's blocking the laser, it will not work. And that's not realistic, but it's much better than nothing.\"\n\nFor some NATO soldiers who come to these training exercises, it might be the first time they've operated in the harsh Arctic environment. Rising tensions between the West and Russia have fueled concerns that a future war between the two could unfold across frozen battlefields, making it critical that troops from Italy to the US are prepared for that possibility. A fight against China, another Arctic rival, could likewise involve Arctic activity.\n\nFinland shares an 800-mile-long border with Russia, is one of NATO's front-line countries, and has long been training for the possibility of renewed conflict in the Arctic, even before it joined the alliance in 2023. The Finns have fought the Russians before. It's been decades since the last round of hostilities, though.\n\n\"Now we are in NATO,\" Aikio said. \"We want to support our allies so that they can also fight and work here in our conditions — in our terrain.\"",

    "fullText": "Uber has a new plan to get 25,000 robotaxis on the road — and it will come with the aid of some Uber alums and an autonomous trucking company.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ride-hailing giant announced a partnership with Waabi, a Canadian self-driving trucking startup founded by Raquel Urtasun. The partnership will include a $250 million investment from Uber, dependent on a set of milestones Waabi will have to achieve. The companies did not disclose what those were.\n\nThere are a few familiar faces here. Urtasun was the chief scientist at Uber's self-driving car division, Advanced Technologies Group. That division was sold in 2020 to Aurora Innovation, another autonomous trucking company and Waabi's competitor.\n\nWaabi's chief operating officer, Lior Ron, is also an Uber alum who founded and led the ride-hailing company's trucking business, Uber Freight.\n\n\"Uber has always been great in building marketplaces, in matching supply and demand, and in pricing,\" Ron told Business Insider. \"That's what created Uber, that what's created Uber Eats, and that's what I created with Uber Freight.\"\n\nAlphabet's Waymo and Amazon's Zoox are already on the ground providing unsupervised rides. Even in its core business, that is, autonomous trucking, Waabi has yet to deploy a fully driverless truck without safety drivers on commercial routes.\n\nThe startup didn't disclose a timeline or announce a partnership with an automaker that can deliver that many cars.\n\nHowever, Ron dismissed the first-mover advantage narrative.\n\n\"I think it's really about: Can the system scale? Can the system be mass-deployed?\" he said. \"It's not about getting the first driver out of the car or truck. It's not about the first lane. It's not about the first neighborhood.\"\n\nTrucking and ride-hailing are two different beasts. One has set routes and long stretches of highway driving; the other sees dense neighborhoods and unpredictable pedestrians.\n\nRon told Business Insider that Waabi has been building a generalizable AI \"brain\" that can be transferred to different vehicle platforms since \"day one.\"\n\n\"Nothing needs to be rebuilt,\" Ron said.\n\nIn addition, Ron said Waabi has built a sophisticated simulator that allows the AI driver to learn from an infinite number of scenarios that can’t easily be replicated in the real world.\n\nThe simulation allows for \"mixed reality testing\": An AI driver steering a truck or car is deployed on a closed course but responds to simulated events like a traffic jam or a lane-changing car that isn't really there.\n\nVideo from Waabi shows how a truck driving on a closed-course environment can slow down, reacting to a virtual traffic jam.\n\n\"Now we can test anything you can imagine — every permutation of traffic jam under the sun, every millions of different scenarios of construction zone,\" Ron said. \"A motorbike cutting you off — you can never do that because you'll be endangering the tester.\"",

    "fullText": "Diana Bahadori was better known online as Baby Rider, a 19-year-old Iranian motorbike influencer whose high-octane Instagram videos drew tens of thousands of followers. Her videos captured her precise cornering and fearless control of superbikes in a country where women riding motorcycles without a headscarf is illegal and often viewed as an act of defiance.\n\nAs of late January, global media reports and activist sources say Bahadori was killed by security forces during ongoing anti-government protests in northern Iran.\n\nAccording to independent Iranian news outlets such as IranWire, Bahadori was shot twice with live ammunition by Iranian security forces in the city of Gorgan around midnight on January 9. After her disappearance, her family searched for her for two days and only received her body on January 11.\n\nThe circumstances of her death have sparked outrage in Iran and among human rights advocates abroad.\n\nThe Iranian government and state media have offered conflicting explanations for what happened to Bahadori. Official statements circulated on her Instagram account claimed she died in a motorbike accident and urged followers not to spread rumors about her death.\n\nIndependent sources, however, say that her family was pressured by intelligence and security agencies to publicly deny responsibility by government forces as a condition of getting her body back. Reports allege that her burial was carried out quietly and without public acknowledgement because of those pressures.\n\nWhat has made this case especially compelling for international audiences is the way it encapsulates the intersecting forces at play in Iran’s current turmoil. The protests first began in late December, triggered by a rapid collapse of the Iranian rial and deepening economic distress.\n\nThey quickly expanded into a simmering revolt against the policies and leadership of Iran’s Supreme Leader and the country’s clerical establishment. Women’s rights, personal freedoms, strict moral codes, and broader political repression have all turned into rallying points for demonstrators across the nation.\n\nBahadori represented a generation of young Iranians pushing up against the boundaries of what is socially and legally acceptable in their society. She had amassed more than 100,000 followers on Instagram by showcasing her riding skills and a kind of vibrant modern lifestyle that many young Iranians find inspiring.\n\nIn a society with strict codes on dress, movement, and gender, a woman confidently riding a powerful motorbike was inherently symbolic.\n\nSocial media activists and diaspora Iranian journalists have invoked Bahadori’s story in the same tradition as earlier cases of young Iranians killed during uprisings. In 2009, the killing of Neda Agha-Soltan by militia forces during protests became a defining moment widely shared on the internet and broadcast abroad.\n\nLook at this beautiful girl. She was full of love and joy for life.\nEven with all the restrictions and bans in Iran, she broke the rules and followed her passion.

Other protest deaths in recent years have similarly sparked anger over state violence and information control.\n\nIranian activist Masih Alinejad took to social media to condemn the treatment of Bahadori, saying the young woman’s only crime was being born under a regime that cannot tolerate the very image of youthful independence.\n\nLook at this beautiful girl, Alinejad wrote. She was full of love and joy for life. Even with all the restrictions and bans in Iran, she broke the rules and followed her passion.\n\nIt remains difficult to independently verify precise details from inside Iran because of restricted press access and government censorship. Independent journalists and human rights groups rely on family accounts, activist networks, and digital communication channels to piece together events that may otherwise go unreported.\n\nNonetheless, international coverage and reporting from outlets like IranWire and multiple global news services have repeatedly cited the core elements of Bahadori’s death.\n\nFor many observers, the loss of Baby Rider is tragic, and a stark reminder of the costs borne by young people in societies marked by political repression and generational conflict. It raises urgent questions about how authoritarian governments respond when a youthful challenge to cultural norms meets fierce political dissent.",

    "fullText": "At a family gathering over Christmas, I took on my 76-year-old mother once again at virtual bowling. Could I finally best her?\n\nMy mother bore me. My mother nurtured me. My mother educated me. She has a resilience unmatched, a love all-forgiving. She is the glue that holds our family together. But right now, I am kicking her ass at video game bowling, and it feels good!\n\nIn the 00s, my mum was the best Wii Bowling player in the world. She was unbeatable. Strike after strike after strike. The Dudette in our family’s Big Lebowski. So when she said she was coming to visit us in Canada, I thought the time was right to buy the updated Nintendo Switch Sports version of her favourite game. She’s 76 now, and I might finally have a chance of beating her, I thought, especially if I allowed myself a cheeky tune-up on the game before she arrived.\n\nI fire up Nintendo Switch Sports to get the lay of the land. Tennis and golf have survived the almost 20 years since Wii Sports, along with bowling. The tennis has nothing to keep me entertained for longer than 10 minutes, and I have been terrified of any golf game where you swing a controller since Christmas morning 2009, when my wife surprised me with Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf for the Wii and I surprised her by throwing my back out after a six-hour session on it.\n\nVolleyball and badminton are a double serving of meh. Little kids might find them fun, but not this big one. Basketball has been carried over from Wii Sports Resort, and Chambara is an updated version of fencing. The latter is every bit as chaotic as the original, the former is still a car crash: the hand motion that you have to use to move and dribble is one that I haven’t vigorously practised since I was a teenager. And I don’t want to do it in front of my mother.\n\nIf basketball is a fender-bender, then the new football game is a multi-car pileup. It’s a slower, less entertaining version of Rocket League, but one that allows you to strap a controller to your leg to virtually kick the ball. There is no way a 56-year-old man should try to kick something that doesn’t exist. You may as well take a pair of scissors to your hamstrings.\n\nHowever, just like Wii Sports before it, Switch Sports is worth every penny because of the bowling.\n\nIt is the very essence of gaming fun and simplicity, which is great because we were all drunk when we had our first session. Three generations of Diamond family silliness. It was beautiful.\n\nMum wasn’t without criticisms of the new version. The updated Mii characters are too realistic; she preferred the quasi-abstract shape of the Wii originals. And she is deflated that the Switch just says “spare” rather than “NICE SPARE!”\n\nHer biggest criticism is the size of the Joy-Con controllers compared with the Wii remote.\n\n“I am happier with something bigger in my hands,” she cackles.\n\nShe is incorrigible. I know where I get it from.\n\nThe next day it was just my mum and I, playing sober. It was a very different kind of gaming, social and laid-back; we talked about how she fell in love with this game during a Christmas at my house back in 2006. My brother was there, with his kids, and my sister-in-law was visiting from Canada. I have zero recollection of this, so thank goodness I have an elderly mother to help me remember things in my dotage.\n\nShe loved it so much that when she returned home, she immediately bought her own Wii. It lives and breathes to this day, with all the plastic adornments you got with Wii Sports – the one and only game she has ever played on it.\n\nIntroducing her to her favourite game feels like a repayment, because my mum was the one who got me into gaming. She had gone back to school to train as a word processing teacher in the 80s and had an interest in programming, so she bought a ZX Spectrum to learn BASIC – but she never had a chance, as us kids hijacked the machine to go Manic Mining. Yup. Our Atic Atac addiction stopped our mum from essentially becoming Brenda Romero.\n\nMum claims she introduced me to the “game” that changed my life. Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing. She has a point. I type crazy fast, because of Mavis. We reminisce about the last-minute calls to her theatre school when we were short of audience members for GamesMaster, and the joy she felt when I got athletes to wave hello to her on the telly.\n\nI wouldn’t have the life I have had without her.\n\nI hope that my kids get me over for a games night when I am 76, so they can finally best me at Street Fighter II, when my arthritic thumbs can no longer pull off a Dragon Punch. And then I hope that their kids do that with them, and this glorious circle of gaming life continues.\n\nI am so happy to have this time with her to play games again. But I’m even happier for the space we fill around the game, the memories we continue to create. A week after she left, I booted up bowling again, but I only played for 10 minutes before I switched it off. It just wasn’t the same without Mum.",

    "fullText": "The Institute for Public Policy Research also argues that tech companies must pay publishers for content they use\n\nAI-generated news should carry “nutrition” labels and tech companies must pay publishers for the content they use, according to a left-of-centre thinktank, amid rising use of the technology as a source for current affairs.\n\nThe Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said AI firms were rapidly emerging as the new “gatekeepers” of the internet and intervention was needed to create a healthy AI news environment.\n\nIt recommended standardised labels for AI-generated news, showing what information had been used to create those answers, including peer-reviewed studies and articles from professional news organisations. It also urged the establishment of a licensing regime in the UK allowing publishers to negotiate with tech companies over the use of their content in AI news.\n\n“If AI companies are going to profit from journalism and shape what the public sees, they must be required to pay fairly for the news they use and operate under clear rules that protect plurality, trust and the long-term future of independent journalism,” said Roa Powell, senior research fellow at IPPR and the report’s co-author.\n\nThe IPPR said work on licensing could begin with the UK’s competition regulator using its new enforcement powers over Google. The Competition and Markets Authority this week proposed giving web publishers and news organisations the power to stop Google scraping their content for its overviews. Collective licensing deals would ensure a wide range of publishers were included, the IPPR added.\n\nGoogle’s AI overviews now reach 2 billion users a month and approximately a quarter of people use AI to get information, according to the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.\n\n“With the right policies in place, the government can shape this market so that UK news organisations transition their business models for the AI age and AI companies improve the reliability of their products by drawing on trusted sources,” said the report.\n\nIPPR tested four AI tools – ChatGPT, Google AI overviews, Google Gemini and Perplexity – by entering 100 news-related queries into those platforms and analysing more than 2,500 links produced by the AI responses.\n\nChatGPT and Gemini did not cite journalism by the BBC, which has blocked the bots they use to assemble answers, while overviews and Perplexity used BBC content despite the broadcaster’s objections to those tools using its journalism.\n\nThe IPPR found the Telegraph, GB News, the Sun and the Daily Mail were cited in fewer than 4% of answers on ChatGPT, while the Guardian – which has a licensing deal with ChatGPT’s parent, OpenAI – was used as a source in nearly six out of 10 responses. The Financial Times, which also has a licensing deal with OpenAI, also featured highly. The Guardian was also the most common source used by Gemini, appearing in half of all answers.\n\nGoogle’s use of AI summaries at the top of search results has affected click-through traffic for publishers, with a knock-on effect for their revenues, because many users read the overview without moving on to the original journalism.\n\nThe IPPR said questions needed to be asked about how financial relationships between AI companies and news providers shaped answers.\n\n“If licensed publications appear more prominently in AI answers, there is a risk of locking out smaller and local news providers, who are less likely to get AI deals,” the report said.\n\nIPPR added that while licensing deals could replace lost advertising revenues to an extent, they would not maintain a healthy news ecosystem. They could make news organisations dependent on tech giants for revenue and that income could easily disappear if copyright protections are weakened, said the thinktank.\n\nThe IPPR said there should be public funding to create new business models for investigative news and local news, whose sustainability could be threatened by the rise of AI news, and for the BBC to “innovate with AI”.",

New Market, Alabama, hit 27 degrees below zero on Jan. 30, while Corinth, Mississippi, fell to 19 below zero.\n\nImmense lake-effect snowfall fell near Oswego, New York, during and after the storm, where a total of 103 inches was measured. At Camden, 50 inches of snow fell, setting New York's all-time 24-hour snowfall record, which is still on the books today. Schools in Oswego were closed for a week. Bulldozers had to be used to remove snow, with helicopters flying in supplies and medical help.\n\nEvery major city from Maryland to New York got more than a foot of snow from the storm:\n\n• Pittsburgh, PA: 14.4 inches\n• Washington, DC: 13.8 inches\n• Allentown, PA: 13.3 inches\n• Philadelphia, PA: 12.7 inches\n• Baltimore, MD: 12.1 inches\n\nAn estimated 201 people were killed from heart attacks while shoveling snow, traffic accidents, cold or in fires started by people trying to heat their homes.\n\nWhile this storm went down in the history books as the Blizzard of 1966, it should not be confused with the deadly March blizzard in the Northern Plains, which is sometimes referred to by the same name.",

    "fullText": "If you have listened to any of Arne Slot's news conferences this season, you will have heard the Liverpool manager refer to 'low blocks'.\n\nThe term essentially refers to a team's defensive shape - blocking space close to their own goal. The closer to their goal, the lower the block.\n\nSlot's side - who cruised to the Premier League title last season in his first year in charge - have struggled for fluidity and consistency this term.\n\nAnd one of the reasons for that, according to the Reds boss, has been their inability to break down sides who defend deep against them.\n\nBut Slot's mentions of low blocks have become so frequent that frustration has started to grow among fans.\n\nLiverpool legend Steven Gerrard said: \"He needs to stop mentioning low blocks. Low blocks have been happening against Liverpool since I was playing. That's just the way it is.\"\n\nHowever, Slot may have a point - with the Reds having faced the highest percentage of low blocks of any top-flight team this season - making up 26% of defensive tactics used against them.\n\nIn fact, the space Slot's side thrived in last year only seems to present itself against European sides in the Champions League, with Liverpool having scored nine goals - and conceded none - in their past two games in Europe.\n\nSo why are the Reds struggling against low blocks domestically, how are they trying to unlock them and what could they do better?",

We have something to cherish being here. We've got life. It's not about trying to be a thug in the streets.\"\n\nDuring the face-off, Stevenson continued chatting to Lopez, who kept a straight face and simply stared at him, before Stevenson delivered a light shoulder barge and walked off stage.",

Musk turned on Starlink service over Ukraine in 2022 ‍after Kyiv pleaded for help in the first days following Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\nDespite Musk's subsequent clashes with Ukrainian officials over his views on the war, Ukraine's military still relies on tens of thousands of Starlinks for battlefield communication and for piloting ​some drone missions.\n\nThey are favoured for their stable connection on the battlefield and for their resistance to ‌enemy signal jamming.\n\nIn a social media post in February 2024, SpaceX said it does not sell or ship Starlink to Russia, and \"does not do business of any kind with the Russian Government or its military\".\n\nThe U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War said it had seen reports of Russia using Starlink-equipped Shahed long-range drones beginning in September 2024.\n\n'HUNDREDS' OF STARLINK-EQUIPPED DRONES\n\nSerhiy Beskrestnov, a newly appointed adviser to Fedorov, drew attention to the issue ⁠over the past week by posting pictures on social media ​of the wreckage of long-range Russian drones, including Shaheds, with Starlink ​terminals.\n\nOn Tuesday, Beskrestnov said that Shahed drones manually flown by pilots, possibly through Starlink, had attacked a passenger train in northeastern Ukraine. That attack killed five people, and was denounced ‍by Kyiv as an act ⁠of terrorism.\n\nOn Thursday, Beskrestnov said there had been \"hundreds\" of cases where Starlink-enabled Russian drones had attacked Ukraine.\n\n\"The complexity of this process lies in the fact that Starlink cannot be suppressed by means of ⁠electronic warfare, and even their position in flight cannot be detected by reconnaissance equipment,\" he wrote, adding that the way to solve ‌the issue was therefore through SpaceX.",

    "description": "Julia Buckley tells PEOPLE she was stopped at the airport when officials couldn’t verify her identity, repeatedly citing her eyes as the issue",
    "fullText": "A routine trip home took a shocking turn when Julia Buckley was suddenly pulled aside at the airport\n\nOfficials insisted something about her passport photo didn’t add up — even as she tried to explain what had changed\n\nHer TikTok recounting the moment sparked a viral debate, with travelers sharing similar experiences\n\nWhat was supposed to be a routine trip home from Cabo turned into a travel nightmare when one woman says she was detained at the airport because officials didn’t believe her passport photo matched her face.\n\nJulia Buckley tells PEOPLE she was returning to San Diego through the CBX crossing after flying into Tijuana when things suddenly went wrong at customs.\n\nAs she walked through the checkpoint, officers scanned her passport and attempted to take a live photo to verify her identity. Buckley says they took her picture five times, but the system still couldn’t confirm it was her.\n\nBefore she fully understood what was happening, she was asked to follow an airport worker into a separate area. She recalls being led into a locked glass room where other travelers were being held, unable to reach her fiancé or use her phone.\n\n“There were handcuffs on the chairs, but I was not handcuffed,” Buckley says, describing the unsettling environment. She adds that she could see her fiancé nearby, but officials would not allow him to wait with her.\n\nBuckley says officers began questioning her repeatedly, asking the same series of personal questions over multiple rounds. During the process, her passport was scanned again and again as officials continued trying to take photos that would match the image on file.\n\nAfter more than 20 attempts, Buckley learned what the officers believed was the issue. “They said my eyes were different,” she says, still shocked by the explanation.\n\nShe tried to point out the obvious changes that had occurred since her passport photo was taken at 18. Now 29, Buckley says she has different hair, different brows and has simply grown from a teenager into an adult.\n\nStill, the officials insisted none of those factors mattered. “They kept telling me it wasn’t any of those things, but it was my eyes,” she says, explaining that they claimed her eyes looked more open in the older photo.\n\nThe experience quickly became emotionally overwhelming, even though she knew she had done nothing wrong. Buckley says the unfamiliar setting made her \"really nervous,\" and she blanked on basic details like previous addresses.\n\n“It was about 40 minutes,” she says of the detention, admitting she felt shaken sitting near other detained travelers. She describes feeling more frightened by the situation itself than by the questioning.\n\nBuckley says she attempted to provide other forms of identification, including her driver’s license, but officials refused to look at anything beyond her passport.\n\nDespite the stress, she says the officers were not cruel or aggressive. “No one was mean,” Buckley explains, adding that she believes they were simply unable to release her until the computer verification worked.\n\nEventually, the doors were unlocked. Buckley recalls officials simply telling her she was free to go, leaving her with no paperwork or guidance for future travel.\n\nWhen she posted the story on TikTok, she expected only her friends to laugh along. Instead, the video went viral, sparking widespread debate about whether her passport photo truly resembled her.\n\n“Half of the people don’t think the picture is me, and the other half think it is,” she says. Buckley also heard from others who had faced similar detentions after weight loss, illness or medical treatment.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nWith another Mexico trip approaching, Buckley knew she couldn’t risk a repeat situation. After reading advice in her comments, she was able to secure a new passport within two weeks and says her most recent trip went smoothly.\n\nNow, she hopes her experience serves as a warning for other travelers. “If you’ve made drastic changes or aged a decent amount, get a new photo,” Buckley says. “It’s not worth it.”\n\nPEOPLE has reached out to CBP for comment.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal teenager Max Dowman has committed his future to the Premier League leaders by signing a pre-contract agreement.\n\nThe Gunners say this will lead to the 16-year-old England youth international signing professional terms when he turns 17 on 31 December.\n\nDowman, who can play on the wing or as an attacking midfielder, had emerged as one of the most sought-after young players in European football but will be staying in north London.\n\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta said Dowman is one of the best young talents he has seen with an apparent comparison to Lionel Messi.\n\n\"Certainly one of the best,\" said Arteta. \"What he's done with us at the age of 15.\n\n\"Me personally, I haven't seen it before. Only with a guy who used to play in Barcelona, but maybe not even that. He certainly has not only that - he has a certain charisma as well and personality that he doesn't get overwhelmed, whether it's by the situation, or the stadium or the opposition, and that's a huge quality to have.\"\n\nDowman, who joined the Arsenal academy when he was eight, added: \"I've been at the club my whole life, so this really means a lot.\n\n\"There's such a clear pathway here, players who have come through our academy, like Bukayo Saka, Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri, who all really inspire me.\n\n\"It's amazing to have role models so close that have experienced the same thing that I have.\"\n\nDowman's contract will see him become a scholar from the summer before transitioning to a professional deal.\n\nAt 15 years and 234 days, Dowman became the second-youngest player to represent the Gunners and the second-youngest to play in the Premier League - with team-mate Nwaneri, currently on loan at Marseille, holding both records.\n\nIn November, he became the youngest player to feature in a Champions League game when he made a substitute appearance in the 3-0 win at Slavia Prague.\n\nDowman has made five senior appearances this season but has spent a period out with an ankle injury.",

    "description": "Noem's actions as homeland security secretary have been under fire following recent incidents with federal immigration agents",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump skipped over Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a Jan. 29 Cabinet meeting\n\nTrump also made the rare move of refusing questions from the press following the meeting\n\nKaitlan Collins, CNN's chief White House correspondent, suggested that Trump's actions allowed the administration to avoid addressing recent DHS controversies from Minneapolis and heightened scrutiny about Noem's leadership\n\nPresident Donald Trump added more fuel to the rumors about Kristi Noem's job security during a Cabinet meeting on Thursday, Jan. 29.\n\nTrump's televised Cabinet meetings — where his top advisers take turns updating him on their departments' priorities — have become opportunities to tout the administration's achievements and comment on current events, however two notable actions by Trump prevented that from happening on Thursday, as many wondered how he would acknowledge the ongoing criticism toward the Department of Homeland Security and its controversial presence in Minnesota.\n\nThe federal immigration operation in Minneapolis has been a source of great backlash for the Trump administration, including with the fatal officer-involved shootings of American citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti; distressing updates about 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos, whose ICE detainment while returning home from preschool with his father went viral; and the recent attack on Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar while she was condemning DHS Secretary Noem at a town hall.\n\nWhile Trump called on many members of his Cabinet for updates on issues like housing, the economy, the ongoing situation in Venezuela and more during Thursday's meeting, CNN chief White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins was quick to note afterward that he skipped over Noem, preventing her from addressing the criticism surrounding her leadership of federal immigration agencies.\n\nTrump also ended the meeting abruptly and, in an exceedingly rare move for the 47th president, declined to take questions from the assembled members of the White House press corps.\n\n\"There have been a ton of headlines generated around Minneapolis, what's happening there, especially with the president changing his leadership there on the ground,\" Collins said on the air immediately after the event. \"That did not come up at all during this Cabinet meeting, and we were there for over an hour and a half.\"\n\n\"Not once was Minneapolis brought up, and obviously no questions were brought up to the president because he did not take questions, despite talking during the Cabinet meeting about how he believes they are the most transparent administration ever,\" she added.\n\nNoem and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino both came under fire for comments made shortly after Pretti's death on Jan. 24, in which they labeled the 37-year-old ICU nurse a \"domestic terrorist.\"\n\n\"This individual who came with weapons and ammunition to stop a law enforcement operation of federal law enforcement officers committed an act of domestic terrorism,\" Noem said while speaking with reporters just hours after Pretti was shot and killed. \"That’s the facts.\"\n\nVideo footage soon revealed that Pretti was holding a cell phone, not a gun, and that Border Patrol agents disarmed him before shooting him at point-blank range.\n\nCalls for Noem's impeachment have come from both Republicans and Democrats; however, when asked on Jan. 27 if Noem would be stepping down, Trump answered simply, telling reporters, \"No.\"\n\nHe has, however, sidelined Noem and Bovino from the operation in Minneapolis. In a Jan. 26 Truth Social post, Trump announced that he was sending his \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, to be his new point person on the ground in the embattled city.\n\n\"I am sending Tom Homan to Minnesota tonight,\" Trump, 79, wrote. \"He has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there. Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me.\"\n\nThe following day, The Atlantic reported that Bovino will return to his Border Patrol post in El Centro, Calif., where he is Commander Op At Large of that sector.\n\nCBS News also reported on Jan. 27 that Noem is unlikely to lose her Cabinet position outright, but is expected to shift her focus away from Minneapolis to \"securing the southern border and other priorities.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nOn Jan. 27, Axios reported that Noem was mounting a defense amid the growing scrutiny, reportedly placing the blame for any DHS missteps on Trump and his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller.\n\n\"Everything I've done, I've done at the direction of the president and Stephen,\" Noem reportedly said, according to a person who relayed the quote to Axios.",

The way you pushed me back into the match on every point is crazy.\"\n\nVictory keeps alive the 22-year-old's bid to write more tennis history - should he win on Sunday, he will become the youngest man to complete the career Grand Slam.\n\nOnly Novak Djokovic - and Alcaraz's own physical condition - now stand in the way of a fourth successive Grand Slam final between the Spaniard and Jannik Sinner.\n\nSerb Djokovic, bidding for a record 25th major singles title, faces world number two Sinner later on Friday.",

She turned professional in 2022 and will return to fighting in Wales for the first time since defeating Jessica McCaskill in her seventh pro bout to become world champion.\n\nAquino, 35, is unbeaten in 10 professional fights but has never competed outside Puerto Rico.\n\n\"Lauren may have the home fans on her side, but I have a country behind me too,\" Aquino said. \"I am coming to take those belts back to Puerto Rico.\"\n\nA victory could set Price up for a push towards becoming the undisputed champion, a goal she said she expected to achieve by the end of last year after beating Jonas.\n\nPrice attended Mikaela Mayer's win over Briton Sandy Ryan in Las Vegas in March, where the American defended her WBO welterweight title.\n\n\"Lauren Price is not just a world champion, she is a Welsh sporting icon and one of the greatest athletes the country has ever produced,\" said Boxxer promoter Ben Shalom.\n\n\"To bring a huge world title defence home to Cardiff for her, live on BBC Two, is something we're incredibly proud of.\"\n\nOn Saturday, British bantamweight Francesca Hennessy will headline on BBC Two in a world-title eliminator against Ellie Bouttell.\n\nIt will be the third time in more than two decades that professional boxing has been shown in prime time on BBC's main channels, following Jeamie 'TKV' Tshikeva's win over Frazer Clarke in November and Troy Williamson's stoppage victory against Callum Simpson in December.",

    "fullText": "A serious health threat has been spreading in Pennsylvania, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and shifting weather patterns may be a contributing factor.\n\nCases of anaplasmosis went up over 50% in Allegheny County in 2025. U.S. states, including Wisconsin and California, have also seen jumps in the tick-borne bacterial infection.\n\nAnaplasmosis is routinely transmitted alongside Lyme disease via tick bites. Initial symptoms of infection include fever, fatigue, and nausea. When left untreated, it can have longer-term consequences.\n\n\"I really can't commit a lot to doing what I used to,\" Janine Hauck told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in late December. Hauck contracted anaplasmosis in 2019 and has since suffered from chronic fatigue, impacting her ability to hike, bike, swim, and engage in the outdoor activities she loves. \"It's changed my life.\"\n\nA major contributor to the increase in anaplasmosis infections is the expanded population and habitat of disease-carrying ticks. Warmer, wetter weather patterns, exacerbated in part by atmospheric pollution, have provided prime conditions for ticks to reproduce.\n\nThis phenomenon has exacerbated the spread of other vector-borne illnesses, including dengue virus and West Nile virus.\n\nAnaplasmosis can be treated with antibiotics if detected early. For this reason, officials recommend regularly checking for tick bites after spending time outdoors. Seeking medical attention soon after a tick bite can help support recovery.\n\nPreventing tick bites in the first place is possible by wearing adequately long clothing and using effective repellents. Hauck told the Post-Gazette that the precautions are worth the hassle.\n\n\"People don't get how bad a tick bite could affect your life,\" she told the paper. \"I probably spent over $60,000 trying to get better. I'm lucky I have [the money], but not everyone does.\"\n\nIn the big picture, attacking the root of the problem may also require reducing emissions as much as possible in order to mitigate increasingly warm, wet weather and to shrink tick habitats and activity.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "When markets are volatile and clouded by uncertainty, investors look for stability. And you can find that stability in dividend stocks, especially Dividend Kings, which have a track record of paying and increasing dividends consistently for more than 50 years. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), of the world’s largest and most diversified health care companies, is one such Dividend King.\n\nAlthough J&J is not a high-flying growth stock, it quietly outpaced the market last year. JNJ stock soared 43.7%, compared to the market’s overall gain of 16.6%. One month into 2026, the stock is up more than 10%, surpassing the S&P 500 Index ($SPX).\n\nMore Layoffs Are Coming at Citigroup in March. What Does That Mean for C Stock and Its 2% Dividend?\n\nThis High-Yield Dividend Stock Is in Turbulent Water. Is the 6%+ Payout Worth It?\n\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. \n\nJ&J’s recent fourth-quarter results reveal why you should buy and hold this dividend stock if you don't already.\n\nIn 2023, Johnson & Johnson made a bold decision to spin off its consumer division — which was comprised of well-known, everyday brands such as Tylenol, Listerine, Neutrogena, and others — into a separate company called Kenvue (KVUE). The goal was to establish a pure-play health care innovation business concentrated solely on drugs and medical devices. This decision has worked well. Its business today operates in two major segments:\n\nInnovative Medicine (Pharmaceuticals) focuses on the development of prescription drugs in oncology, immunology, neurology, and cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases.\n\nMedTech (Medical Devices) refers to medical technologies utilized by hospitals and surgeons.\n\nThe Innovative Medicine segment generates the majority of J&J’s revenue and drives most of its growth. In the fourth quarter, the segment generated $15.7 billion in revenue, an increase of 10% year-over-year. For the full year, the segment revenue increased by 6% to $60.4 billion. The company reported a 5.3% increase in worldwide sales of $94.2 billion, despite a significant headwind from the loss of exclusivity on Stelara. Adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 8.1% year over year to $10.79.\n\nWith 21% operational sales growth in 2025 and projected annual sales of over $50 billion by 2030, oncology continues to be one of the company's biggest growth engines. Meanwhile, the MedTech segment’s revenue grew 7.5% in Q4 and 6.1% for the full year, generating $34 billion in sales, driven by Cardiovascular, Surgery, and Vision. With over 60 active clinical trials and multiple regulatory submissions planned, MedTech continues to provide a second major growth pillar alongside Pharmaceuticals.",

Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) criticized Vice President Vance Thursday morning, calling comments he made about the other senator from Illinois, Tammy Duckworth (D), “low.”\n\n“I have learned over many years in office that politics ain’t beanbag. But JD Vance’s attack and insult of my colleague, Tammy Duckworth, is low and beneath the dignity of a Vice President,” Durbin said in a post on social platform X.\n\n“Senator Duckworth has never backed away from a fight, even with a Vice President. She has fought for and won a seat in the Senate where she fights for veterans, those with disabilities, and the people of our state,” Durbin added, lauding his fellow Prairie State senator.\n\n“J.D. Vance should focus on repairing the chaos his President has created, not on a Senator who has earned the respect of the Senate for her courage and effectiveness.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Duckworth slammed Vance after the vice president bashed her line of questioning at a Senate hearing. He compared her to the fictional character Forrest Gump, who was portrayed as having a physical and intellectual disability.\n\n“Forrest Gump ran toward danger in Vietnam. Your boss ran to his podiatrist crying bone spurs,” Duckworth wrote on X, noting President Trump’s medical draft deferments.\n\n“Petty insults at the expense of people with disabilities won’t change the fact that you’re risking troops’ lives to boost Chevron’s stock price,” she added. “It’s my job to hold you accountable.”\n\nVance had posted earlier on X, “Watching Tammy Duckworth obsessively interrupt Marco Rubio during this hearing is like watching Forest Gump argue with Isaac Newton.”\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Vance’s office for comment.",

    "fullText": "(Corrects to clarify remarks by official in paragraph 23)\n\nVERBIER, Switzerland, Jan 29 (Reuters) - A New Year fire that killed 40 people at a Swiss ski resort bar has shaken a lucrative tourism industry that long had an impeccable reputation and has piled pressure on the country to tighten safety standards.\n\nNews ​that \"Le Constellation\" bar, in the town of Crans-Montana in Canton Valais, had gone six years without a safety check quickly prompted officials to ban some practices, including the ‌use of sparkling candles blamed for the tragedy.\n\nThe stain on Switzerland's otherwise exemplary safety record was quickly felt as local hoteliers reported cancelled bookings in a canton where the cost of real estate in resorts such as nearby Verbier ‌can fetch prices on a par with Hong Kong.\n\n\"There were cancellations, there were reservation postponements to later dates in hotels,\" said Bruno Huggler, director of the Crans-Montana tourism office, after the blaze that killed mostly teenagers and injured more than 100 people.\n\nLe Constellation owners Jacques Moretti and his wife are under investigation for negligent homicide and other crimes.\n\nThe disaster has ignited a fractious political debate over safety, including calls for harmonised national standards in a country that prizes local autonomy.\n\nIt has also sparked alarm in Verbier's hospitality sector.\n\n\"We realize this could very well happen right here,\" said Lionel Dubois, head ⁠of Verbier's Association of Hoteliers, Cafe Owners and Restaurateurs. \"That, I think, ‌is a bit frightening.\"\n\nTourism in Switzerland was worth about $22.17 billion, or 3% of national output in 2021, official data showed.\n\nWhile bookings at Crans-Montana's roughly 1,300 hotel rooms have suffered, the overall picture is stable, as chalet and apartment rentals cover most stays, tourism boss Huggler said.\n\nYoung people have been ‍shaken, though, and while some restaurants are returning to life, bars remain quieter, said Cedric Berger, head of the Association of Apartment and Chalet Owners of the Crans-Montana Upper Plateau.\n\nSome local accommodation providers have seen cancellations in short-term vacation rentals.\n\n\"January is a month to forget, a lost month for everyone,\" said Berger.\n\nSurvivors of the fire, which also killed French and Italian citizens, are still hospitalised around Europe.\n\nCrans-Montana apartment owners from Italy ​and France are angry, said Berger, who is also a lawyer.\n\n\"People go to Valais not because it's the 'best party', but because it's Switzerland, and you think it's safe. If that quality ‌disappears, then Switzerland's 'fortress' is a bit shaken,\" he added.\n\nAnxiety about the fallout is palpable in Verbier, where Reuters contacted 37 hospitality venues.\n\nMost declined to speak or did not reply, though the 12 who did said checks were conducted properly. But all agreed that rules must be reinforced to guarantee regular inspections, limit numbers at venues and provide fire-safety training to staff.\n\nIn four of Switzerland's 26 cantons, including Valais, building insurance is not mandatory - potentially increasing risks for owners hit by fire, as well as weakening controls.\n\nThe Swiss Insurance Association said over 90% of buildings in Switzerland are insured according to market estimates, adding it does not keep precise figures on how many are not. Reuters could not establish if Le Constellation had building insurance.\n\nThe fire generated the ⁠biggest media storm around Switzerland since the 2023 collapse of Credit Suisse bank, said Alexandre Edelmann, head of ​Presence Switzerland, the foreign ministry unit that promotes the country's image abroad.\n\nAs media reports about Switzerland jumped to 25 ​times more than average in early January, a crisis room was established to support people abroad following the fire, said Edelmann.\n\nLawmaker Jacqueline de Quattro, head of the lower house of parliament security committee, said the fire had exposed potential shortcomings in Switzerland's federal system, which allows cantons to set their own ‍rules.\n\n\"We believed we had strict rules and that Switzerland ⁠was well‑prepared,\" said de Quattro. \"But then we were brutally confronted with reality.\"\n\nProposing a national review to harmonise standards backed by an events industry group, she voiced concerns over event professionals' reports of sloppy work stemming from inadequate training, cost pressures and irregular inspections.\n\nBut the head of Verbier's Val de Bagnes municipality, Fabien Sauthier, said inspections need resources ⁠and that, while regular checks occur, it was tough to inspect some 400 public buildings annually with just four full-time safety officials.\n\nAnd any push towards greater federal oversight could face resistance.\n\n\"I'm a Swiss person, so I think the canton ‌should decide what it wants to do,\" said Willy Schranz, head of the municipal council in Adelboden in Canton Bern. \"If you take responsibility, then it's a ‌very good system.\"",

    "fullText": "EL PASO, Texas (KTSM) — El Paso District Court Judge Marlene Gonzalez is stepping back from cases involving migrant children, following allegations that she behaved impartially and prejudiced toward them in hearings.\n\n“As a judge, the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct prevents me from submitting to an interview or commenting on a case that I have recused myself from hearing. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide this response,” read a statement from Gonzalez who noted she voluntarily recused herself from hearings regarding unaccompanied migrant children’s cases.\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2025, attorneys from Estrella del Paso – an immigrant advocacy organization – filed a motion to recuse Gonzalez from hearings involving unaccompanied migrant children – children entering the U.S. illegally and without a parent or guardian.\n\nIn the court filing, attorneys and social services workers with the organization submitted written declarations detailing allegations that Gonzalez showed a “pattern and practice of cruelty” towards migrant children during the hearings.\n\nThe declarations made allegations that Gonzalez would subject children to humiliating interrogations about why they left their country, and that on multiple occasions she shamed the children for abandoning their parents.\n\nIn one account an attorney alleged that Gonzalez interrogated a 17-year-old Guatemalan boy who testified that he fled his country to Mexico from an abusive alcoholic father, but that he was kidnapped and beat up twice while in Mexico. The attorney alleged that in response, Gonzalez “harangued” the boy: “Why didn’t you stay in another part of Mexico? It’s beautiful, and it’s big. Why didn’t you stay in another part of Mexico?” the document read.\n\nIn another hearing involving a 16-year old Venezuelan girl from Venezuela who had been a victim of child prostitution, an attorney alleged that Gonzalez scolded the child “not to engage in prostitution.”\n\nThe filing went on to note that despite these alleged practices by Gonzalez, she would “unexpectedly” grant children their petitions seeking Special Immigrant Juvenile Visas, but that she recently began denying the petitions without providing any reasoning in 2025.\n\nEstrella del Paso declined an interview request with KTSM and instead offered the following statement:\n\n“For nearly 40 years, Estrella del Paso has provided legal representation and other legal services to immigrants in El Paso. We are a non-profit law firm. As attorneys, we take our legal and ethical duties to our clients very seriously, and we file every motion and document with the court with these duties in mind. The motion filed includes several detailed examples that our legal team took time and detailed care to compile. For accuracy and completeness, we encourage you to refer directly to that filing. We will not comment on the motions or our interactions with the court. All our clients are owed a duty of confidentiality, and we will not violate this duty, especially in the case of vulnerable children.”\n\nGonzalez’s current term runs through 2028.",

    "fullText": "EVANSVILLE, Ind. (WEHT) — Despite a program first from star guard Camryn Runner, the University of Evansville women’s basketball team couldn’t outlast Belmont in overtime.\n\nThe Purple Aces had the Bruins’ back against the wall late in the fourth quarter with a five point lead following a three-pointer by Sydney Huber. But three costly turnovers and missed free throws helped Belmont send the game into overtime tied at 59.\n\nIn OT, UE got on the board first, but foul trouble put the game in the Bruins’ hands. Belmont shot a total of 16 free throws in the full five minutes of overtime outscoring the Purple Aces in the quarter by six. Evansville dropped the game 79-73.\n\n“There’s no question that some losses hurt worse than others,” said head coach Robyn Scherr. “And you know if I had to choose between two types of losses, I’d take this one over getting beat by 20. So you know again I think we’re proving a lot to ourselves right now about who we can compete with. And so you know there was a ton of positives in this game to take from, and then there are things we’re going to learn from too and hopefully clean up. And hopefully that’ll help us down the road.”\n\nRunner recorded the first triple-double in program history with 19 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists. While Georgia Cox continued her recent strong play, scoring a career high 23 points to go along with four assists. Huber knocked down three three-pointers to round out the group with 11 points. Worth noting star guard Logan Luebbers Palmer missed her third straight game.\n\nEvansville will be back in action Sunday, February 1st, against Indiana State in Meeks Family Fieldhouse at 3 p.m. The game is set to stream on ESPN Plus.",

    "description": "Here's what Penny Hardaway said after Memphis basketball beat FAU on Jan. 29.",
    "fullText": "To Memphis basketball coach Penny Hardaway, the solution is simple.\n\n\"All we have to do is care,\" Hardaway said after the Tigers blew out FAU 92-65 on Jan. 29 at FedExForum to break a two-game losing streak.\n\n\"We have the system, we have great coaches that put the game plan in place, we just haven't been doing the game plan properly, because it hasn't been important enough. Maybe it's individual stats over team, and we only want guys out there that are going to be team.\"\n\nMemphis (10-10, 5-3 American Conference) is coming off a brutal week that included back-to-back losses to Tulsa and Wichita and then extra time spent in Wichita because the Tigers could not travel back home due to the winter storm that affected much of the South.\n\nHardaway said the coaching staff mostly left the players alone during that time.\n\n\"I think that silence was pretty loud there,\" Memphis guard Sincere Parker said.\n\nThe Tulsa game was lost late, but the Wichita State game fell apart in the first half. Leading scorer Dug McDaniel left that game with an injury, but Hardaway said that actually helped him find more lineup combinations.\n\n\"I don't know if I would've seen this coming if it weren't for the second half and Dug getting injured, to be honest,\" Hardaway said. \"Because I don't know if we would've ever put that group out there without Dug. And just to see that just showed us that we can rest Dug.\"\n\nMcDaniel scored 23 points and dished out six assists in the win over FAU.\n\nThough the Owls were missing their top two scorers in Devin Vanterpool and Kanaan Carlyle, it still went down as a dominant win for a Tigers team that got beat handily in Boca Raton earlier this month.\n\nMemphis is back in action on Feb. 1 when it hosts Tulane (2 p.m., ESPN2).\n\n\"We've been playing a little soft in the beginning, and we're trying to change that narrative,\" McDaniel said. \"From this game on, we're going to try to make an emphasis to set the tone first, be more physical off the rip. And I feel like today was a good step in that direction.\"\n\nReach sports writer Jonah Dylan at jonah.dylan@commercialappeal.com or on X @thejonahdylan.\n\n\"I hate to keep saying that, but it's just honest.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Memphis Commercial Appeal: Penny Hardaway explained Memphis basketball win vs Florida Atlantic",

    "fullText": "Manchester United focused on strengthening up top instead of at the back following the disaster that was the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nIt was decided that a centre-back would join once the current season concluded, with the futures of several stars up in the air.\n\nHarry Maguire’s contract is up in the summer, while Matthijs de Ligt’s injury record makes for grim reading.\n\nWhat the Red Devils really need is a left-footed profile, someone who can eventually succeed Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw as the left-sided centre-back.\n\nThe Argentine has been linked with an exit, while criticism continues to grow against him. And as per El Crack Deportivo, United have zeroed in on his compatriot as the perfect backup.\n\nRiver Plate’s Lautaro Rivero has emerged as an option for the 20-time English league champions, and they intend to sign him in the summer.\n\nThe Argentine giants are aware of United’s interest in the 22-year-old, and have therefore slapped a €100 million release clause into his contract.\n\nRiver do not want to lose the Argentina international on the cheap, amid interest from Strasbourg, Tottenham, City Football Group, Juventus, and Atletico Madrid.\n\n“Manchester United intend to secure the services of Lautaro Rivero, a key player in Gallardo’s squad.\n\n“River Plate made Rivero sign a €100 million release clause, so if they want to sign him, they must pay a figure close to that amount.”\n\nRivero is already an Argentina international, and could be on the plane to the US for the World Cup if he continues performing as he has.\n\nHe has made 18 appearances for the River Plate first team and can play both in central defence and as a left-back.\n\nDescribed as an “elite” ball-playing defender, it will be interesting to see if United can get a deal for another South American talent over the line.\n\nHowever, it is likely to be for a fee much lesser than what is being quoted in the report.\n\nFeature image Hernan Cortez via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "MANHATTAN (KSNT) — Kansas State couldn’t get it done against Colorado Thursday night, dropping to 11-11 and 4-5 in conference play.\n\nThe loss came at the hands of a former Wildcat Zyanna Walker, who recorded 13 points and 10 boards for the Buffaloes.\n\nWalker, a junior guard at Colorado, transferred after spending two years with K-State. She started all 36 games for the Wildcats last season in its Sweet Sixteen run, averaging over eight points per game and shooting 40.2%.\n\nThe Big 12 foes clashed back and forth throughout the first half, with neither team ever pulling away. Colorado led by just four at the end of the second quarter.\n\nThe Buffaloes looked to finally pull ahead with 5:38 left in the third off a Jade Masogayo three-pointer to lead by eight. However, the ‘Cats clawed back and kept it within four with ten to go.\n\nK-State looked to gain some momentum in the fourth quarter. A Brandie Harrod and-one gave K-State a three-point advantage with 7:33 to go.\n\nTied with under six remaining, Walker nailed a three-pointer to take back the lead for the Buffaloes. Colorado never looked back and extended its lead to nine by the final buzzer.\n\nColorado defeats the Wildcats 56-47.\n\nFreshman guard Jordan Speiser came off the bench and led the Wildcats in scoring with 12, including going 8-8 from the free-throw line. Senior guard Tess Heal missed her second game for the Wildcats, as she still awaits word from the NCAA regarding her violation.\n\nThe game extends K-State’s skid to two after losing to rival KU 83-61 in Lawrence Sunday.\n\nThe Wildcats look to get back above .500 in Tempe, Arizona, this Sunday against the Arizona State Sun Devils. The Sun Devils sit at 18-4, 4-5 under head coach Molly Miller in her first year at ASU.\n\nFor more sports news, click here.

    "fullText": "Ranking shortstops is never just about comparing stat lines. It is about identifying who provides the most value in baseball’s most demanding position. MLB Network’s “The Shredder” combines recent performance with a deep dive into offensive and defensive metrics to sort the elite from the very good. Here are the 10 players it rates highest as we approach the 2026 campaign.\n\nStats to know: 26 HR, 26 SB (2025).\n\nNeto lands at number 10 on both The Shredder’s list and Brian Kenny’s personal rankings, which speaks volumes about his rapid ascent. The logic for his inclusion is simple enough. He is already producing power and speed from a premium spot on the diamond very early in his career. For the Angels, that dual-threat ability is the cornerstone of a lineup that desperately needs reliable production up the middle.​\n\nDe La Cruz checks in at number nine on The Shredder’s 2026 list, a clear nod to a toolkit that can alter the course of a game even when he isn’t fully dialed in. He holds the same spot on MLB.com’s recap, keeping him firmly within the position’s top tier. His appeal is easy to see. He pressures defenses in ways that almost no other shortstop can, forcing the league to account for him on every single pitch.​\n\nStats to know: .840 OPS (2025).\n\nPeña arrives at number eight for 2026, marking his first appearance in the Top 10 at shortstop according to MLB.com. This detail is significant because these lists typically favor sustained value over isolated hot streaks. Houston has always asked its shortstops to be steady with the glove and productive at the plate, and Peña’s recent performance confirms he is meeting that high standard.\n\nTurner sits at number seven on the SI-reported Shredder list, occupying the territory where consistency and track record start to weigh as heavily as peak potential. His ranking reflects an established history of production that keeps him relevant even as the position gets younger and deeper. When a player remains in this tier year after year, it signals that analysts still trust his baseline contributions despite a crowded field at the top.​\n\nStats to know: 20 HR, 7.1 FanGraphs WAR (2025).\n\nPerdomo lands in sixth place, a jump framed by MLB.com as the result of a breakout season that redefined his profile. While the power surge grabbed headlines, the real differentiator at shortstop is when that offense comes without sacrificing defense. For Arizona, this ranking serves as validation that his strong season wasn’t a fluke. It has moved him onto the short list of the game’s best at his position.\n\nStats to know: 21 Outs Above Average (led NL SS), 17 Defensive Runs Saved (most among SS).​\n\nBetts holds the fifth spot for a second consecutive year, which is impressive considering he is still relatively new to playing shortstop full-time. The defensive metrics highlighted in the SI report explain why he remains here. The model is rewarding legitimate shortstop value rather than just a superstar playing out of position. With the Dodgers committing to him as their starter for 2026, this isn’t a temporary experiment. It is simply their plan.​\n\nHenderson ranks fourth on the 2026 list after entering last season at number one. This placement matters because it suggests his overall package remains elite even if the top spot has shifted. In a ranking system that weighs both offense and defense, staying in the top four means you are impacting the game on both sides of the ball rather than just compiling counting stats.​\n\nLindor slots in at number three, a ranking reserved for players who deliver reliable output year after year at a position that exposes every flaw. He also takes third on MLB.com’s recap, reinforcing that his standing is one of the least debated in the top 10. When a position is this deep, being a consensus top-three choice is an accomplishment in itself. It means your floor is respected just as much as your ceiling.​\n\nSeager enters 2026 at number two on The Shredder’s list, keeping him squarely in the conversation for the game’s best shortstop. He also holds the second spot on MLB.com’s published rankings, aligning the broader view with the model’s data. The main takeaway here is stability. Even with constant turnover around the league, the rankings continue to treat him as a pillar near the very top of the position.​\n\nStats to know: Led MLB in hits for the second straight season.\n\nWitt claims the number one spot for 2026, becoming the sixth different shortstop to lead the list in the last six years. MLB.com links his rise directly to his production, specifically highlighting his back-to-back seasons leading the majors in hits. In a model built to blend offense, defense, and overall impact, that combination of volume and value is exactly what pushes a player to the top of the list.​\n\nRankings don’t win games, but they do show where the league’s most dependable two-way value can be found. This top 10 reminds us that playing shortstop in 2026 requires a wide range of skills that all lead to the same result: winning impact. The only real verdict will come in April when these names have to turn their list positions into victories on the field.\n\nThe post MLB: Top 10 Shortstops heading into the 2026 season appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Alexander Volkanovski and Diego Lopes are just a day away from settling their score once and for all.\n\nAhead of their featherweight championship main event rematch at UFC 325, Volkanovski and Lopes both successfully hit the limit for a UFC title fight, with Volkanovski stepping to the scales at 144.5 pounds and Lopes at 145 pounds.\n\nVolkanovski defeated Lopes via unanimous decision to capture a vacant belt at UFC 314 in April, making “The Great” a two-time featherweight champion. Lopes then fought Jean Silva the following September, scoring a spectacular knockout over Silva to keep his name in the contender mix and eventually get his second crack at Volkanovski, who hasn’t fought since their first encounter.\n\nCo-main event lightweights Dan Hooker and Benoit Saint Denis also successfully made weight with both making use of the one-pound allowance for a non-title fight and registering at 155.75 pounds.\n\nOf the 28 fighters competing Saturday, Aaron Tau was the lone miss, and it was a strange—and costly—one. Tau was the last fighter to weigh in, arriving about 90 minutes into the official window. The Road to UFC flyweight tournament finalist stripped down and was concealed behind a box for his weigh-in, which the commission appeared to struggle with as they took several minutes to register a number.\n\nSurprisingly, Tau came in well under the limit at 122.5 pounds. This immediately raised suspicion and Tau was asked to weigh in again without the box after dressing. He then came in at 129 pounds. Somehow, Tau went from 3.5 pounds under to three pounds over the non-title flyweight limit.\n\nSoon after, it was announced on the UFC’s official morning weigh-in show that Tau’s Road to UFC tournament final bout against Namsrai Batbayar has been cancelled.\n\nAt the desk, Chris Weidman and RJ Clifford questioned if Tau, who flexed while weighing in behind the box, was touching the sides of the curtain with his elbows.\n\nAaron Tau weighs in at 122.5 which is very low for the weight (125) So, the made him re-weigh in without the curtain and he suddenly misses weight at 129!? 7 pounds gained without a curtain! His fight vs. Namsrai Batbayar has now been cancelled. #UFC325\n\nVery, very weird. pic.twitter.com/lqdsdWrp2v\n\n— Bodyslam.net MMA (@BodyslamNetMMA) January 30, 2026\n\nCheck out the UFC 325 weigh-in results below.\n\nMain Card (Paramount+ at 9 p.m. ET)\n\nAlexander Volkanovski (144.5) vs. Diego Lopes (145)\n\nDan Hooker (155.75) vs. Benoit Saint Denis (155.75)\n\nRafael Fiziev (155.5) vs. Mauricio Ruffy (155.25)\n\nTai Tuivasa (265.5) vs. Tallison Teixeira (259)\n\nQuillan Salkilld (155.5) vs. Jamie Mullarkey (155.5)\n\nPreliminaries (Paramount+ at 7 p.m. ET)\n\nJunior Tafa (205.25) vs. Billy Elekana (204)\n\nCameron Rowston (184.5) vs. Cody Brundage (184.75)\n\nJacob Malkoun (185.75) vs. Torrez Finney (185.75)\n\nJonathan Micallef (170.5) vs. Oban Elliott (169.75)\n\nEarly Prelims (Paramount+ at 5 p.m. ET)\n\nKaan Ofli (145.25) vs. Yizha (145.5)\n\nSangwook Kim (155.75) vs. Dom Mar Fan (154.75) — Road to UFC Lightweight Final\n\nKeiichiro Nakamura (145.25) vs. Sebastian Szalay (145.75) — Road to UFC Featherweight Final\n\nSulangrangbo (135.75) vs. Lawrence Lui (135.25) — Road to UFC Bantamweight Final\n\nAaron Tau (129)* vs. Namsrai Batbayar (126) — Road to UFC Flyweight Final\n\n*Tau missed weight.

    "fullText": "Former Wales Under-20s captain Harry Beddall is punching above his weight for Dragons after impressively making the step up to the United Rugby Championship (URC).\n\nThe open-side flanker arrived at Rodney Parade last summer from Leicester and the initial plan was to bed him in gently in Super Rygbi Cymru with Ebbw Vale.\n\nHowever, the 21-year-old from Cardiff has made seven senior outings, five of them starts, and produced a remarkable defensive display at Munster last weekend.\n\nThe official URC stats recorded 33 tackles by Beddall in the 22-20 loss in Cork, as Dragons came agonisingly close to a huge upset.\n\nThe 5ft 10in (1.78m), 14st 11lb (93.9kg) flanker is ranked 15th in the league tackle chart on 99 despite only featuring in six of 10 rounds.\n\n\"He started to make it so hard not to pick him. He is phenomenal and a great talent with a great attitude,\" said Dragons defence coach Dale MacLeod.\n\n\"I have never seen someone with such survivor skills. No matter where he is, whether squashed or held down, he fights to get up and to the next tackle.\"\n\nWales lock Davies called into Six Nations squad\n\nWainwright's emotional Wales return after death of father\n\nBeddall's appetite for defence comes as no surprise after his efforts when captaining Wales in the 2025 Under-20 Six Nations.\n\nHe topped the tournament tackle chart with 109 in five fixtures, including 34 in the backs-to-the-wall win against Ireland in the Rodney Parade rain.\n\nBeddall arrived at Dragons with limited senior experience after a solitary Premiership Cup appearance for Leicester and some outings for Hartpury University RFC in the English Championship.\n\nThe flanker is proving to be cut from the same cloth as Rodney Parade cult hero Nic Cudd, another 5ft 10in (1.78m) open-side that mixed it with the heavy hitters.\n\n\"We talked about 'Bedds' at the start of the season and how we would give him a little bit of a taste because he is only a young man,\" said MacLeod.\n\n\"He got an opportunity because of some injuries and then went out and made something like 20 tackles.Then he went out and made 29.\n\n\"Bedds is like a dynamo and he plays bigger than he is. He is so accurate around collisions and his chop tackling.\"\n\nDragons, who take on Ospreys in Bridgend on Saturday (19:45 GMT) have also picked Thomas Young, Harri Keddie and Shane Lewis-Hughes in the seven jersey this season.\n\nBeddall, the club's lightest forward, has profited from learning from the senior back-row forwards – and now has them sweating on their starting spots.\n\n\"He is very coachable with a want to get better,\" said MacLeod. \"He takes nothing for granted, he keeps working on his action plan and is really clear about how he is going to get there.\n\n\"He rips into it and has been a real find. Some of the older boys are looking behind because he is not just turning up but he's fronting up.\"",

    "description": "Experimenting on the frontier of AI using beans",
    "fullText": "Since the title is a bit of click-bait, I should probably specify what I mean by bean based.\nI found a lovely tool for creating beans that are essentially just markdown files with some front matter for task tracking.\nNow back to the article!\n\nI feel like a mad scientist.\nI spent the last week analyzing agentic coding tools, ideating on what I like and dislike about them, and then deciding to build my own.\n\nDuring my analysis, the main issue I found with most agentic coding tools right now is that they all focus on one thing: running as many agents in parallel as possible.\nBut why? Why run 10, 100, or even 1000 agents when you are unable to write enough tickets for them to consume?\n\nMaybe I’m wrong. Maybe I should be running hundreds of agents in parallel, but I can’t honestly say I’ve ever run more than 2 at a time.\nBoth working on separate tasks, and I spent most of my time not in setting up and running agents, but in defining the work that needs to be done.\nAlso, the context switching from managing two agents was exhausting.\n\nI want to take this in a new direction. Let’s flip the entire script on its head and think about this pragmatically.\nI don’t think the bottleneck here is a lack of enough agents. The bottleneck is not having clear enough tasks for these agents to work on.\nI can not write instructions fast enough to outpace the work of a single agent. I doubt you can either. Prove me wrong.\nI have yet to see anyone actually write and think fast enough to keep up with the pace of a single agent writing the code.\nMost of my time working with an agent is spent answering questions, rethinking approaches, and dealing with unforeseen bugs.\nIt requires a ton of my attention and focus to handhold these agents.\n\nWhat if we took a different approach? What if we looked at some examples of how software engineering has been traditionally managed?\nIn come PRDs (Product Requirement Documents), made with the explicit intent to get one person’s thoughts into another person’s actions.\nIsn’t that all we are doing with agents now, defining a document for an agent to follow instructions to implement?\n\nI’m building Daedalus, a from-scratch custom planning agent. Yes, I’m building an agent from scratch. Yes, I don’t really know how this will go.\nI believe we live in an exciting wild time with an entire new frontier, waiting to be explored. I’m putting in the time and effort to try an experiment for myself.\nI am willing to accept failure. I am willing to be wrong. I hope that this works.\n\nDaedalus was the greatest mortal craftsman and inventor in Greek mythology—an Athenian architect, engineer, and artist whose name literally means “skillfully wrought” or “cunning worker.”\n\nHe’s essentially the mythological archetype of the brilliant but flawed engineer—someone whose genius creates both wonders and disasters, who solves problems with ingenuity but can’t escape the human consequences of his choices.\n\n— Claude\n\nI chose the name Daedalus because I feel that it embodies the soul of an engineer: planning, thinking, criticizing, researching, and questioning.\nYet, there is hubris manifest in his work, which parallels how I feel about AI coding agents. Daedalus doesn’t write code—that’s not the point.\nThough, he has access to a breadth of expert sub-agents: critics, skeptics, pragmatists, architects, simplifiers, UX researchers, code explorers, and more.\nThe goal for Daedalus is to outpace the coding agent, which I’ve aptly named Talos, the bronze automaton that protected the island of Crete.\nYou don’t talk to Talos, nor do you need to. He finds the next task and starts working. Do note that I’ve tailored Talos to approach coding using TDD (test driven development),\nwhich I’ve found yields a slightly better success rate for autonomous implementation. I borrowed the idea and a few other skills from the superpowers repo.\n\nHowever, that’s not to say what I’ve built is prescriptive. You can do it at home, without any of my specialized tools.\nYou need two agent instances, OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex, it doesn’t matter. One is your coding agent, always in “build” mode.\nIt’s confined to a ralph loop, always picking up the next available task. The other, a planning agent, whose only responsibility is to create tickets and critique what already exists.\nNo specialized tools. This is a workflow, a process. Not something to be sold to you.\n\nA bit more about beans. It describes itself as, “A CLI-based, flat-file issue tracker for humans and robots.”\nHowever, the power in this approach over other longer term memory tools for agents, like beads, is that it’s plain text.\nThe tool parses the front matter of the beans on startup and then works on that in-memory data structure.\nThe beauty is that I can easily read and modify this myself, and I can check it into git.\nAdditionally, beans has a built-in GraphQL API, which is quite handy for the agents to be able to get relational data about these flat files.\nEach bean has a title, status, type, priority, and optional blockedBy fields. I’m using this to handle complicated, long running, and autonomous PRD implementation.\nMy ralph loop starts by querying for beans that are in-progress or todo then creates the dependency graph using the blockedBy field.\nThis allows me to find which bean we need to work on first, pass that bean to the coding agent and let it run.\n\nBeans are the lifeblood of this workflow. Whether or not you use beans or another tool, it doesn’t really matter.\nThe only thing you need to make it work is a structured way to define tasks with enough context that an agent can work on it without human intervention.\nAnd ideally in that structure you have some way to organize which tasks are dependent on the work of other tasks.\n\nYour role in this system is to guide. It’s to sit with the planning agent, and only the planning agent. To scope out features, bugs, epics, and milestones.\nTalk with the planning agent and create a bean, iterate on it, question its design, scope, and purpose. Once you feel like it’s done, move on.\nLet the planning agent write the outline and implementation details in the bean. Then pass it to the coding agent and take a walk.\n\nNow the real power comes from not just creating these beans and passing them to a coding agent. It’s in the dependency graph.\nBeyond just the blockedBy, it’s the parent/child relationships between milestones, epics, features, tasks, and bugs.\nAnd taking advantage of that structure in a ralph loop. Learn more about ralph loops here. As I’ve been experimenting, I’ve noticed additional ways I can modify my loop and make it better.\nThe original ralph loop uses a <promise>DONE</promise> signal to track when the agent says it’s done.\nI rely on the bean being moved to the completed status.\n\nHere’s the flow for my ralph loop (or you can view the source code):\n\nThat’s it, it’s basically a while loop that feeds beans to an AI agent until they’re done.\n\nSo where is Daedalus now? Well it’s still a WIP. You can use the philosophy and workflow now but I am working on a tool to make this significantly easier.\nYou can check out the repo here and use the agents and skills in your OpenCode or Claude Code.\n\nI’d love to hear some feedback on what you think about this experiment.",

    "fullText": "I founded Treehouse in 2011 and was the CEO until it was acquired in 2021. Here's a complete history of what happened at Treehouse.\n\nThe Case for the 32-hour Workweek: Atlantic\n\nSince 2006, Ryan Carson, the CEO of Treehouse, has maintained a four-day workweek for his employees. “There’s no rule that you have to work 40 hours, you have to work more to be successful,” says Carson. “We’ve proven that you can take it from an experiment into something that’s doable for real companies and real people in highly competitive markets.” Citing the benefits of a more flexible schedule, Carson believes that the reduced time in the office ultimately leads to an overall more productive work environment. But for Carson, his decision ultimately comes down to priorities. “It’s not about more family time, or more play time, or less work time—it’s about living a more balanced total life,” says Carson. “We basically take ridiculously good care of people because we think it’s the right thing to do.”\n\nChamath Palihapitiya is the founder of Social Capital, a purpose-driven venture capital firm that invests primarily in healthcare, education, and financial services. (Social Capital was a Treehouse investor.) In this interview from 2013, Pasan Premaratne talks to Chamath about the reasons behind his investment choices and some of the challenges facing entrepreneurs.\n\nOregon Business article about Ryan Carson, CEO of Treehouse\n\nIn 2015, I was voted Entrepreneur of the Year by EY.\n\nJoe had always thought you needed to fit a certain stereotype to be a developer. When he realized there was an opportunity for him to learn to code and make a difference as a developer, he took the risk and switched careers. Since learning with Treehouse, Joe has embraced a rewarding career as a developer.\n\nIn less than 10 months of using Treehouse, Bryan landed his first full time professional programming job and got a huge increase in salary!\n\nKavitha was out of the workforce for 12 years and then one day decided to learn to code and 4 months later she had her first app in the Apple App Store.\n\nI launched Treehouse because I deeply believed in democratizing access to computer science education so people could change their lives. I'm grateful to have led the company to teach over 1,000,000 students in 10 years.\n\nAs time progressed, I learned hard lessons about the importance of focusing on profitability and maintaining strategic clarity. I changed the company's priorities too many times, and I take full responsibility for the outcome.\n\nThroughout my entrepreneurial journey with Treehouse, I gained invaluable insights that have shaped me as a leader and innovator. I learned the critical importance of balancing bold vision with pragmatic execution and adapting quickly to changing market conditions. Cash flow management and profitability are key to building a resilient organization.\n\nMost importantly, I learned that trust is the foundation of any successful venture—trust with investors, employees, and customers. I am committed to applying these lessons with humility, transparency, and a steadfast dedication to creating value for all stakeholders.\n\nAs I move forward in my career, I am excited to leverage my experience and hard-won insights to build organizations that make a lasting, positive impact. I am dedicated to continuous learning and improvement, always striving to earn the trust of those I serve.",

    "description": "Enter The Freak Circus online. A dark horror visual novel of twisted romance. Survive the deadly obsession of Pierrot and Harlequin in this fan game portal.",
    "fullText": "Welcome to the show. Uncover the secrets of The Freak Circus game and survive the twisted obsession of Pierrot and Harlequin.\n\nGame by Garula. Support the creator on itch.io.\n\nWelcome to the definitive fan portal for The Freak Circus game, a psychological horror visual novel that has captivated the indie gaming community. If you are looking to experience The Freak Circus game online or understand its intricate lore, you have arrived at the right place. Developed by Garula, The Freak Circus game stands out in the genre for its unique blend of romance, terror, and obsession. This game is not for the faint of heart, but for those who enjoy a darker shade of storytelling, it offers an unforgettable experience.\n\nThe Freak Circus game presents a yandere-themed narrative where you, the protagonist, become the object of affection for two mysterious and dangerous figures: Pierrot and Harlequin. Set against the backdrop of a chilling carnival, The Freak Circus game weaves a tale where nothing is as it seems. The vibrant lights of the Big Top in The Freak Circus game hide dark secrets, and the laughter of the clowns often masks a sinister intent. The Freak Circus game masterfully explores themes of control, survival, and the blurred lines between love and madness.\n\nThe curtains rise, but who is pulling the strings? In The Freak Circus, every performance could be your last.\n\nPierrot is a central figure in The Freak Circus who commands attention without speaking a word. As a silent yandere, his communication relies on intense gazes and political actions. His route in The Freak Circus game is fraught with tension, creating an atmosphere of constant unease. Many players of The Freak Circus game find his path to be the most unsettling due to the unpredictability of his silence. Unlike traditional visual novel love interests who might use words to woo the player, Pierrot's affection is demonstrated through possessive behavior and eerie pantomime.\n\nThe atmosphere of The Freak Circus game is one of its strongest suits. From the moment you start the game, you are enveloped in a soundscape that is both whimsical and unsettling. The visual design complements this perfectly, with character sprites that shift from charming to terrifying in the blink of an eye.\n\nIn contrast, Harlequin is the vocal and seductive counterpart in The Freak Circus game. Charming yet manipulative, he introduces a different flavor of danger to The Freak Circus game. His rivalry with Pierrot adds a layer of conflict that drives the narrative of The Freak Circus game forward, forcing the player to navigate a deadly triangle of obsession. Harlequin uses his words as weapons, weaving complex webs of lies and half-truths that can easily ensnare an unsuspecting player.\n\nHarlequin's route in The Freak Circus game explores the chaotic side of madness. While Pierrot is static and brooding, Harlequin is dynamic and explosive. He brings a manic energy to scenes that can quickly turn from festive to violent. Players who choose to pursue Harlequin in The Freak Circus game must be prepared for a rollercoaster of emotions, where affection and aggression are two sides of the same coin.\n\nIn The Freak Circus game, death is not the end—it is merely a transformation.\n\nAudio cues in The Freak Circus game often hint at danger. A sudden stop in the music, or the faint sound of music echoing through The Freak Circus game, can indicate that mood has shifted.\n\nBranching paths in The Freak Circus game mean death is never far away. Keep multiple slots, especially before critical decisions involving Pierrot.\n\nThe lore of The Freak Circus game is hidden in the details. Zoom in on background objects to uncover the tragic stories of past victims.\n\nThe setting of The Freak Circus game is more than just a backdrop; it is a character in itself. The Freak Circus game arrives in town overnight, bringing with it a fog that seems to separate the fairgrounds from the rest of reality. In The Freak Circus game, the laws of physics and logic seem to bend. Tents appear larger on the inside than the outside, and the passage of time becomes fluid.\n\n\"The game alludes to a dark history involving the Ringmaster, a figure who is mentioned but rarely seen. Theories suggest that The Freak Circus game is a purgatory for souls who have committed crimes of passion.\"\n\nBoth Pierrot and Harlequin seem trapped in their roles, performing their twisted play for an unseen audience. The arrival of the protagonist disrupts this cycle, offering them a chance at—or perhaps just a new form of—damnation. Understanding this lore enriches the experience of playing The Freak Circus game. It adds a layer of tragedy to the horror. When Pierrot gazes at you with his sad, painted eyes, is he seeing a lover, a savior, or a victim? In The Freak Circus game, the answer is often all three.\n\nSince its release, The Freak Circus game has garnered a dedicated following. The game's unique blend of horror and romance has inspired countless works of fan art, fan fiction, and cosplay. The characters of Pierrot and Harlequin have become icons in the indie visual novel scene.\n\nThe developer, Garula, has been praised for their engagement with the community. Updates to The Freak Circus game often include requested features or nods to popular fan theories. By playing The Freak Circus game on this portal, you are joining a global community of horror enthusiasts who appreciate the darker, more psychological side of storytelling.",

    "fullText": "President Lee Jae Myung said Thursday that workers must adapt swiftly to the era of artificial intelligence (AI), in an apparent message to Hyundai Motor's labor union, which has strongly opposed the carmaker's planned introduction of humanoid robots at production facilities.\n\n\"A labor union appears to have announced that it will stop robots from entering production sites. That may be part of its overall protest strategy,\" Lee said during a meeting with senior aides at Cheong Wa Dae.\n\n\"But once the massive wagon starts rolling, we cannot stop it,\" Lee said, likening the current situation to the past, when the introduction of steam engines triggered machine-breaking protests by laborers worried about losing jobs.\n\nLee added: \"Ultimately, society has to adapt quickly. People need to learn new skills and adjust rapidly to the new environment.\"\n\nThe president stressed the importance of preparing workers for technological change rather than resisting it, as AI-driven automation accelerates across industries. He also underscored the need for fundamental policies to prepare for extreme polarization in an AI-driven economy.\n\nWhile Lee did not name a specific labor group, his comments were widely interpreted as directed at Hyundai Motor's labor union, which recently lashed out at the carmaker's plans to deploy humanoid robots at production sites.\n\nIn a statement released earlier in the day, the union said management is seeking to materialize a so-called \"dream factory\" that operates 24 hours a day using only AI-powered robots.\n\n\"There is no place for humans anywhere in the plan,\" the union said, expressing concerns that robots would ultimately take over all jobs.\n\nThe union added that Hyundai Motor Group discussed the unmanned factory initiative, dubbed the \"DF247\" project, as a key priority at its annual Global Leaders Forum earlier this month. The project envisions fully automated facilities operating around the clock.\n\nThe union warned that such developments would eventually affect all workers in Korea, arguing that the balance between consumption and supply would be disrupted, creating a vicious cycle in the nation's economy.\n\nThe union statement came about a week after the workers voiced strong opposition to the carmaker's plan to deploy Atlas robots made by Boston Dynamics, its U.S. robotics unit, across major assembly lines in Korea and overseas.\n\nHyundai Motor has identified the Atlas robot as a key future growth engine in the emerging era of physical AI.\n\nThe company unveiled its vision at the CES 2026 tech fair earlier this month, outlining plans to mass-produce up to 30,000 humanoid robots by 2028 and gradually deploy them at its manufacturing sites, including Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America in Georgia.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea Handler, 50, says being childfree didn't stop her from taking parenting classes to show up for other kids.\n\nOn Thursday's episode of \"Dinner's On Me with Jesse Tyler Ferguson,\" Handler spoke about her choice not to have children and her close relationship with the three daughters of an ex-boyfriend.\n\n\"It's not that I don't have a maternal instinct. I do, I just don't want children,\" Handler told podcast host Jesse Tyler Ferguson.\n\n\"I feel like not having my own children has opened me up to being in the lives of so many other children,\" Handler said. \"Of course, I love children. I just don't want them around me all the time.\"\n\nThe comedian said she enjoys being a positive influence on kids, whether it's in the role of a big sister or a parental figure.\n\n\"Whatever it is, I have the bandwidth — because I don't have children — to spend time with so many children,\" she said.\n\nHandler said she's still close with her ex-boyfriend's three daughters, despite dating him for only a year, in part because she recognized parts of her own upbringing in their experiences.\n\n\"I related so much to all of that because I grew up in a household where I was the youngest of six. My parents were completely checked out,\" Handler said. \"My brothers and sisters raised me, and I craved and wanted the parent that was going to show up to the games, and show up to the school conference nights, and be at my plays, and be at my, you know, at like the auditorium at school.\"\n\n\"My parents didn't do any of that. And so that's what I wanted to be for them,\" she continued.\n\nHandler said she even took parenting classes for the girls.\n\n\"But I did it, and I loved it. Like, I learned so much from the psychologist about what children need to feel safe, secure, and seen,\" Handler said.\n\nShe added that being involved in their lives feels meaningful to her.\n\n\"For me, since I'm not a parent, I still find it so purposeful to have influence over them in a positive way, and to go out of my way for them feels good.\"\n\nHandler has previously spoken about how being childfree has given her the freedom to build close relationships with the children in her life.\n\n\"I've been able to show up for other people's children in ways that I wouldn't be able to if I had my own family,\" Handler said in an April appearance on the \"Reclaiming with Monica Lewinsky\" podcast. \"So I feel like there is an unsung story about people who don't have children, whether it's by choice or by, you know, circumstance, that there are so many opportunities to have children in your life and and you have to find those.\"",

    "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook says a global memory chip shortage is beginning to bite, with rising costs expected to pressure margins ahead.",
    "fullText": "The global memory chip shortage is catching up with Apple, Tim Cook says.\n\nThe Apple CEO said on the company's first-quarter earnings call that Apple is beginning to feel the effects of the memory shortage crisis, with rising prices expected to put pressure on margins ahead.\n\nThe warning comes amid blockbuster demand for Apple's newest products. Customer response to the latest iPhone lineup \"exceeded our expectations,\" with iPhone revenue jumping 23%, Cook said on the call Thursday.\n\nApple reported revenue of $143.76 billion and earnings per share of $2.84, beating analyst estimates.\n\nThe staggering iPhone demand left Apple exiting the December quarter with \"very lean\" inventory, pushing the company into what Cook described as \"supply chase mode.\"\n\nCook said the biggest constraint is the limited access to advanced chipmaking nodes used to produce Apple's system-on-a-chip processors. Higher demand has also reduced flexibility across Apple's supply chain, he said.\n\nMemory shortages played a minimal role in Apple's December-quarter margins, but their impact is expected to grow, Cook added.\n\nThe company expects memory costs to weigh more heavily on margins in the second quarter, contributing to its forecast gross margin range of 48% to 49%. Apple posted a gross margin of about 48% in the December quarter.\n\n\"We do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly,\" Cook said. \"As always, we'll look at a range of options to deal with that.\"\n\nApple's stock price rose about 2% after hours following the results on Thursday.\n\nCook's comments come as the tech industry grapples with a worsening global shortage of memory chips.\n\nAI companies, smartphone makers, and PC manufacturers are competing for the same pool of memory components, which are critical not just for consumer electronics but also for powering large language models and other AI systems. That surge in demand has sent prices climbing.\n\nAt CES 2026 last month, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, described the memory storage market as \"completely unserved.\"\n\n\"This market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world's AIs,\" he said at CES with analysts.\n\n\"The amount of context memory, the amount of token memory that we process, KB cache we process, is now just way too high,\" he added, referring to AI storage needs.\n\nThe Korea Economic Daily reported in January that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are seeking server DRAM price hikes of 60% to 70% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter. Market analysis firm Counterpoint also said last month that memory prices could climb as much as 40% through the second quarter of 2026.\n\n\"The memory market is at an unprecedented inflexion point, with demand materially outpacing supply,\" an analyst from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation wrote in a December note.\n\nThe rapid buildout of AI infrastructure marks a break from the industry's traditional \"boom-and-bust cycles.\"\n\n\"For consumers and enterprises alike, this signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage, at least in the medium term,\" the analyst added.",

    "fullText": "Costco did not even sell merchandise on its website until 1998, and, in those days, the selection was very limited.\n\nAs a longtime member, I used the website for benefits such as Costco Travel and ancillary services, like TurboTax access, that the warehouse club sells. Until much more recently, though, I rarely bought anything there.\n\nNow, Costco has a greatly expanded selection, and it allows members to use Instacart and Shipt to order select items directly from its warehouses. It's building on that with its digital-only program, Costco Next, which lets members access items the warehouse club does not stock.\n\nIt's not a new service; it has technically been around since 2017. But Costco does not promote the offering, and it's something I, and many other members, did not know about.\n\nIn fact, I only learned about it because the chain started mentioning it during earnings calls, which most members do not listen to or read transcripts of.\n\nA third-party marketplace like the model pioneered by Amazon, Costco Next offers an expanded selection of items that never make it into a Costco warehouse. The program, however, differs from Amazon's approach in important ways.\n\nApril 17, 2001: Costco expands online with a B2B e‑commerce site aimed at business customers, accessible through the main Costco.com site, according to a 2001 Costco earnings release.\n\n2017: Costco partners with Shipt for grocery delivery in select U.S. markets and expands same‑day and two‑day delivery options for members, reported SuperMarket News.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic (2020 to 2021): Online sales surge dramatically as consumer demand for non‑contact shopping grows. Costco’s ecommerce growth in 2020 surpassed the prior five years combined, according to the retailer's fourth-quarter 2021 earnings release.\n\nCostco's deal with Shipt ended in 2025, according to Costco's website, and was replaced with an Instacart partnership.\n\n\"Our digital vision at Costco is to deliver a seamless experience that builds trust and loyalty with our members both in warehouse and online,\" Costco CEO Ron Vachris said during the company's first quarter 2025 earnings call. \"We aim to make shopping at Costco easier, faster, and more personal, no matter where or how our members choose to shop. This isn't about technology for technology's sake.\"\n\nCostco Next allows the retailer to offer more merchandise, but have it shipped directly from partners. The warehouse club, however, is still careful with its merchandise, and its buyers work with partner retailers.\n\nIt's a more carefully curated selection than Amazon offers, because Costco remains focused on offering value to members. The retailer has grown Costco Next from its modest beginnings.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nHistory of Costco: Company timeline and facts\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\n\"Costco Next, our curated marketplace, also continues to show healthy year-over-year growth. In Q3 fiscal year 2025, our sales on Costco Next equaled our total sales for all of fiscal year 2022, and we are excited about the pipeline of new vendors and development for future rollout,\" CFO Gary Millerchip said during the company'sthird quarter 2025 earnings call.\n\nCostco Next is a curated third‑party marketplace that lets Costco members buy directly from select brands and manufacturers at discounted prices, without Costco holding all the inventory itself.\n\nProducts are offered from hand‑selected suppliers chosen for the quality of their merchandise and strong customer service, expanding the variety beyond typical warehouse inventory.\n\nThe platform helps Costco offer higher‑margin discretionary items (e.g., electronics, appliances, goods sold directly from vendors) while leveraging member pricing perks.\n\nAccording to strategic reports, Costco Next has become a scalable engine for high‑margin products, with estimated sales in Q3 2025 equal to Costco’s entire fiscal 2022 performance in that channel, AInvest reported.\n\nThe impetus for Costco Next is to strengthen e‑commerce and mobile growth by offering discounted deals from trusted brands that complement warehouse inventory.\n\n“Separate from what members will find in the warehouses or at Costco.com, Costco Next showcases products from some of Costco’s suppliers that have been selected for the quality of their merchandise and their exceptional customer service,” Costco General Merchandise Manager Cheryl Smeby said on Costco's website.\n\n“By shopping at Costco Next, you have access to a variety of products from these vendors, and you’ll get a discount that is available only to Costco members.\"\n\nCostco is not alone in adding an online marketplace.\n\n\"Marketplaces are a relatively simple, low-capital way of expanding choice and widening audiences,\" GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders shared on RetailWire.\n\nHe believes, however, that it's not as simple as tacking on an online marketplace to an existing business.\n\n\"If they work, they can generate incremental revenue. But they are not surefire winners. Retailers need to make sure they don’t just cannibalize existing sales, and they cannot be used as an excuse to neglect the core proposition. And of course, there are now so many marketplaces that the strategy is not really a big differentiator,\" Saunders added.\n\nHis Retailwire Brain Trust colleague, Jeff Hall, believes that online marketplaces are table stakes, but must be run with intent.\n\n\"They allow you to expand assortment, enter new categories, and test demand without tying up capital or taking markdown risk. Just as important, they attract new customers who often convert into higher value buyers of owned inventory,\" he posted.\n\nCostco Next has been around since 2017, but the brand has never promoted it.\n\n\"Costco instead relies on its memberships and rotating selection of deals to do the selling for it, often through social media and word of mouth. Costco Next benefits similarly from this fear of missing out,\" CustomerThink.com shared.\n\nThe services launched with about 15 suppliers.\n\n\"There are currently over 90 brands included in the Costco Next universe. Some are familiar: Mikasa dinnerware, Dearfoams slippers and Thomas Kinkade Studios fine art. You’ll also find Artika lighting products, Baggallini accessories, Bench activewear, Cangshan handcrafted cutlery, Briggs & Riley luggage and Golden Arowana flooring, among others,\" Kiplinger reported.",

    "description": "Microsoft’s stock has plummeted 12% owing to a slight miss on revenue, showing how spooked investors are by the “spend now, profit later” AI market.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street’s yearslong bet on AI is facing a severe test on Thursday, as investors might begin to view OpenAI—and generative AI in general—not as a catalyst for continuous growth, but as a source of systemic risk for Big Tech.\n\nA sharp selloff in tech stocks on Thursday underscored investors’ exhaustion with the “spend now, profit later” model that has propelled the AI bull market for three years. Microsoft led the retreat, with its shares plummeting 12% by noon, erasing more than $440 billion in market value, a collapse it hasn’t seen since the pandemic. The Nasdaq was down almost 2% at time of writing.\n\nWhy did Microsoft's stock plunge 12% on Thursday?\n\nWhy are Oracle shares down from September highs?\n\nHow much of Microsoft's future revenue depends on OpenAI?\n\nWhat is driving investor concerns about AI capex spending?\n\nThe immediate catalyst, it seems, is an intensifying focus on capex, or capital expenditures. Microsoft revealed that its spending surged 66% to $37.5 billion in the latest quarter, even as growth in its Azure cloud business cooled slightly. Even more concerning to analysts, however, was a new disclosure that approximately 45% of the company’s $625 billion in remaining performance obligations (RPO)—a key measure of future cloud contracts—is tied directly to OpenAI, the company revealed after reporting earnings Wednesday afternoon. (Microsoft is both a major investor in and a provider of cloud-computing services to OpenAI.)\n\n“It’s the collapse of software and the ascent of hardware, and it is staggering,” CNBC’s Jim Cramer noted on X on Thursday, as the market punished companies that are spending billions on software infrastructure while failing to show immediate returns.\n\nIt’s an “ominous” statistic, Morning Brew cofounder Austin Rief wrote on X, especially combined with the fact that Meta is planning to devote most of their free cash flow to capex. Meta has evaded the selloff on a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast, showing a healthy 24% year-over-year revenue increase, driven by online ads. The fact that Wall Street is letting Meta get away with their also massive capex indicates the reason why investors are selling off: They don’t trust OpenAI to bring that revenue on their own without massive infusions of outside cash.\n\nThe sentiment shift is not limited to Redmond. Oracle has seen its shares halved from their September highs, erasing nearly $463 billion in value. Once a darling of the AI trade, Oracle has also struggled with investor confidence that the massive data centers it is building for OpenAI will get funded eventually. Additionally, the timeline for several projects has reportedly slipped to 2028, creating a gap between the company’s heavy debt-funded spending and the arrival of actual revenue.\n\nOpenAI has made about $1.4 trillion in commitments to procure both the energy and compute it needs to fuel its operations. But its revenue barely crossed $20 billion in 2025.",

    "fullText": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Maine arrested an asylum-seeker and hauled him away, leaving behind his one-month-old baby and wife, who does not have a driver’s license.\n\nThe Portland Press Herald reported on Wednesday that on Jan. 21, Hassane Barry and his wife, Nene Barry, who are asylum-seekers from Guinea, were on their way home from an appointment to obtain a passport for their baby. But Hassane Barry never made it home, as his car was abruptly boxed in by four unmarked vehicles.\n\nThe Press Herald described the arrest:\n\nArmed and masked federal agents stepped out and said Hassane’s name. They were here for him.\n\n“There’s a baby in the car,” Barry told the agents. “There’s a baby.”\n\nAgents shattered his driver’s side window. Glass sprayed over the baby’s car seat, Nene Barry said. Her husband was arrested and pulled into an unmarked police car. Officers left the scene in a matter of minutes.\n\nNene Barry, who does not have a driver’s license and speaks little English, was left alone inside the car with her infant.\n\n“He did everything for us, and now he’s not here. What am I going to do alone with a 1-month-old baby in the cold?” Nene Barry said in an interview this week in French.\n\nVideo given to the Press Herald shows the aftermath of the incident. Shards of glass littered the street and the interior of the car. “I have a baby,” Nene Barry repeated in broken English.\n\n“There was a car seat in the back with one of those baby blankets you get at the hospital. There were broken glass shards all over it,” one witness told the paper, on condition of anonymity due to concerns for their safety. “I carefully pulled back the blanket and there was just this tiny peanut of a baby. He was crying.”\n\nHassane Barry, 38, has no known criminal record, his attorney said, and a search for a criminal history yielded no results. His English tutor told the Press Herald that Barry worked as a tow truck driver for AAA and worked as a ride-share driver on the side. At last check, Barry was being held at a detention facility in Plymouth, Massachusetts.\n\nNene Barry said she is afraid to leave her home, and has left just once, to bring her son to a medical appointment.\n\nThe arrest comes amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants, as well as immigrants who are in the country legally.\n\nLast week, an ICE agent in Portland went viral after he was filmed telling a woman that she was going into a “database” for “domestic terrorists” for daring to film him in public.\n\nThe post ICE Agents Shatter Car Window After Being Told ‘There’s a Baby’ Inside, Haul Asylum-Seeking Father Away first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "CEO Mark Zuckerberg said AI tools now let individual Meta employees do work that once required large teams.\n\nMeta plans to boost AI spending by between 60% and 87% this year as output per engineer continues to rise.\n\nDespite compute constraints, Meta said it's looking to hire top AI talent.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says AI is transforming what a single employee can accomplish at the company, signaling it's adopting a new hiring strategy.\n\nOn an earnings call with analysts Thursday, Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said the company is investing in more AI-native tools to elevate individual contributors and flatten teams. The effort is being somewhat constrained, however, by a lack of compute resources.\n\n\"We're starting to see projects that used to require big teams now be accomplished by a single very talented person,\" he said. \"I want to make sure that as many of these very talented people as possible choose Meta as the place that they can make the greatest impact.\"\n\nThe Facebook and Instagram parent, which reported fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, said it plans to boost AI spending by between 60% and 87% this year. Meta also said it already saw a significant increase in output per engineer last year, with the majority of that growth coming from the adoption of agentic coding.\n\nThough teams are on track to become smaller, finance chief Susan Li said on the earnings call that the company is still hungry for top talent. \"It remains a very competitive hiring market, but we'd like to invest aggressively where we can,\" she said.\n\nLi also noted that Meta closed out the December-ended quarter with 6% more employees than it had a year earlier, driven by hiring in areas such as monetization, infrastructure, Meta Superintelligence Labs, regulation, and compliance.\n\nMeta isn't alone in focusing on tiny teams. The strategy has become popular in the startup world, where founders have long prioritized scrappiness. It's a trend that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted would take hold back in February 2024.\n\n\"We're going to see 10-person companies with billion-dollar valuations pretty soon,\" he said at the time. \"In my little group chat with my tech CEO friends, there's this betting pool for the first year there is a one-person billion-dollar company, which would've been unimaginable without AI. And now [it] will happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, large companies have been thinning their middle manager ranks in recent years to boost efficiency by reducing bureaucracy, including Amazon and Intel. Meta's Zuckerberg wrote a memo in 2023 entitled \"Flatter is faster,\" and in late 2024, Google CEO Sundar Pichai told staff that the company cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of an efficiency push.",

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — President Donald Trump’s latest attempt to sidestep the United Nations through his new Board of Peace appears to have inadvertently backfired after major world powers rejected U.S. aspirations for it to have a larger international mandate beyond the Gaza ceasefire and recommitted their support for the over 80-year-old global institution.\n\nThe board to be chaired by Trump was originally envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing his plan for Gaza's future. But the Republican president’s ambitions have expanded to envisioning the board as a mediator of worldwide conflicts, a not very subtle attempt to eclipse the Security Council, which is charged with ensuring international peace and security.\n\nThe board's charter also caused some dismay by stating Trump will lead it until he resigns, with veto power over its actions and membership.\n\nHis secretary of state, Marco Rubio, tried to ease concerns by saying the board's focus right now is only on the next phases of the Gaza ceasefire plan.\n\n“This is not a replacement for the U.N., but the U.N. has served very little purpose in the case of Gaza other than the food assistance,” Rubio said at a congressional hearing Wednesday.\n\nBut Trump's promotion of a broadened mandate and his floating of an idea that the Board of Peace “might” replace the U.N. have put off major players and been dismissed by U.N. officials.\n\n“In my opinion, the basic responsibility for international peace and security lies with U.N., lies with the Security Council,” Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Thursday. “Only the Security Council can adopt decisions binding on all, and no other body or other coalition can legally be required to have all member states to comply with decisions on peace and security.”\n\nIn Security Council statements, public speeches and behind closed doors, U.S. allies and adversaries have dismissed Trump’s latest plan to overturn the post-World War II international order with what he describes as a “bold new approach to resolving global conflict.”\n\n“The U.S. rollout of the much broader Board of Peace charter turned the whole exercise into a liability,” according to the International Crisis Group’s Richard Gowan, a U.N. watcher and program director. “Countries that wanted to sign on to help Gaza saw the board turning into a Trump fan club. That was not appealing.”\n\n“If Trump had kept the focus of the board solely on Gaza, more states, including some more Europeans, would have signed up,” he said.\n\nKey Security Council members haven't signed on\n\nThe four other veto-wielding members of the Security Council — China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom — have refused or have not indicated whether they would join Trump's board, as have economic powers such as Japan and Germany.\n\nLetters sent this month inviting various world leaders to be “founding members” of the Board of Peace coincided with Trump’s vow to take over Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and punish some European countries that resisted. That was met with stark rebuttal from Canada, Denmark and others, who said Trump’s demand threatened to upend an alliance that has been among the West's most unshakeable.\n\nShortly after, Trump pulled a dramatic reversal on Greenland, saying he had agreed with the NATO secretary-general on a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security.\n\nAmid the diplomatic chaos, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who at the time had not responded to Trump’s Board of Peace invitation, met with Guterres in London and reiterated “the UK’s enduring support for the UN and the international rules-based system,” according to a statement.\n\nStarmer emphasized the U.N.’s “pivotal role in tackling global problems which shape lives in the UK and all over the world.” The United Kingdom later declined to join the board.\n\nFrance, Spain and Slovenia declined Trump’s offer by mentioning its overlapping and potentially conflicting agenda with the U.N.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said last week that the board goes beyond “the framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.”\n\nSpain would not join because the board excluded the Palestinian Authority and because the body was “outside the framework of the United Nations,” Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said.\n\nSome countries are urging a stronger UN\n\nAmerica’s adversaries also have shunned the board.\n\n“No single country should dictate terms based on its power, and a winner-takes-all approach is unacceptable,” China’s U.N. ambassador, Fu Cong, said at a Security Council meeting Monday.\n\nHe called for the United Nations to be strengthened, not weakened, and said the Security Council’s status and role “are irreplaceable.”\n\nIn a clear reference to the Board of Peace, Fu said, “We shall not cherry-pick our commitments to the organization, nor shall we bypass the U.N. and create alternative mechanisms.”\n\nSo far, about 26 of some 60 invited countries have joined the board, and about nine European countries have declined. India did not attend Trump’s signing ceremony at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last week but is reportedly still deciding what to do. Trump revoked Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s invitation.\n\n“It’s hardly surprising that very few governments want to join Trump’s wannabe-U.N., which so far looks more like a pay-to-play club of human rights abusers and war crimes suspects than a serious international organization,” said Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director for Human Rights Watch. “Instead of handing Trump $1 billion checks to join his Board of Peace, governments should work on strengthening the U.N.”\n\nEight Muslim nations that agreed to join the board issued a joint statement that supported its mission in Gaza and advancement of Palestinian statehood. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates made no mention of Trump’s global peacemaking plan.\n\nThe Crisis Group’s Gowan said their focus could be a way to “get a foothold in discussions of Gaza” at the start, as Trump’s ceasefire plan has already faced several setbacks.\n\n“I remain unconvinced that this is a real long-term threat to the U.N.,” Gowan said.",

    "fullText": "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) said Thursday there is a “very strong case” to charge the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) official who shot Alex Pretti multiple times on Saturday with voluntary manslaughter.\n\n“I see a case that requires a state investigation and requires a state determination as to whether prosecution is warranted,” Shapiro said at an event hosted by The Christian Science Monitor.\n\n“I would argue, based on the publicly available evidence, that you could make a very strong case for voluntary manslaughter against the federal official who pulled the trigger multiple times.”\n\nVideo of the incident shows Pretti recording immigration officials before attempting to assist a woman whom one agent had pushed to the ground. At that point, he was shoved down himself and surrounded by officers, with one appearing to disarm him before another fired multiple rounds at the 37-year-old.\n\nCBP, which oversees Border Patrol, notified Congress on Tuesday that two agents fired shots during the incident, according to The Associated Press.\n\nShapiro, who previously served as the Keystone State’s attorney general, also said there is a “very strong case” the Border Patrol agents committed obstruction of justice when they did not secure the crime scene.\n\n“I think you might be able to make out a case for conspiracy, if there was a clear directive that that crime scene should be compromised, that you should not participate in an investigation,” the Pennsylvania governor added. “So I think all three of those charges could be warranted.”\n\nShapiro noted, though, that he is “not privy” to all the evidence that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison (D) and local prosecutors have regarding the shooting.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) took over the investigation into the incident over the objections of Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA), which oversees use-of-force incidents by officers in the state.\n\nIn a lawsuit brought by the BCA, a federal judge in Minnesota blocked DHS on Saturday from “destroying or altering” evidence from its probe.\n\nWhite House border czar Tom Homan, meanwhile, said at a Thursday press conference that the federal immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota has not been “perfect.”\n\n“I do not want to hear that everything that has been done here has been perfect. Nothing is ever perfect. Anything can be improved on and what we’ve been working on is making this operation safer, more efficient, by the book,” said Homan, whom President Trump dispatched to the state to handle the operation earlier this week.",

    "fullText": "A lawsuit filed against the Red Sox alleges the team jacked up ticket prices illegally.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in Massachusetts federal court earlier this month and claims the Sox advertised false prices for tickets to baseball games and other events at Fenway.\n\nThe lawsuit says fans would see one price but then pay another after junk fees were added, which could more than double the ticket price in some instances.\n\n“The Red Sox’s false advertising centers on their use of drip pricing and junk fees. Specifically, the Red Sox would advertise illusorily low prices for their tickets,” the lawsuit filed against the Fenway Sports Group states. “When purchasers attempted to buy those tickets, however, the Red Sox would add mandatory fees at the last minute, such as “Per-Ticket Fees” and “Order Fees,” that could increase the cost of a purchase by as much as 150%.\"\n\n“In other words, the Red Sox’s advertised tickets were not actually available for purchase at the advertised prices,” the suit continues. “The Red Sox’s use of drip pricing and junk fees was both unfair and deceptive. It was also illegal under the consumer protection laws of Massachusetts and other states.”\n\nWhen Boston 25 News reached out for a comment, a Red Sox spokesperson told us they do not comment on pending litigation but that they’ve always complied with the law.\n\nDownload the FREE Boston 25 News app for breaking news alerts.\n\nFollow Boston 25 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch Boston 25 News NOW",

That is the sort of production Denver needs.\n\nYes, it will be pricey, but Pickens proved that the character narratives surrounding him, for the most part, weren't a thing at all in Dallas.\n\nHe's earned his big contract, and if it sees him land with the Broncos, Nix will be one happy quarterback.\n\nESPN hints at major reason Todd Monken moved on from Ravens\n\nKeon Coleman the big winner from Bills press conference\n\nRavens' Jesse Minter offers perfect quote on Lamar Jackson\n\nAnalyst sees potential trade for Eagles' $29 million weapon\n\nBills urged to sign All-Pro weapon for Josh Allen\n\nBills' Joe Brady solves Keon Coleman's future with 1 sentence",

    "fullText": "Michigan State football is reportedly \"regaining the momentum\" in their pursuits for a big-time prospect in the 2026 class.\n\nRivals recruiting insider Greg Smith reported on Thursday that Michigan State is \"regaining the momentum\" in a key recruiting battle with Penn State for four-star wide receiver Samson Gash. National signing day is right around the corner, and it appears that it'll come down to the Spartans or Nittany Lions for Gash's commitment.\n\nGash is a four-star wide receiver, with a recruiting rating of 90.80 in 247Sports' composite system. He ranks as the No. 47 wide receiver and No. 6 player from Michigan in the 2026 class. He is also listed as the No. 289 overall prospect in the class.\n\nGash has been verbally committed to Michigan State since the summer, but elected to not sign with the Spartans during the early signing period due to the recent coaching change. However, he has never fully opened up his recruitment and it appears Michigan State may still be in the drivers seat to add this elite-level wide receiver.\n\nClick on the post below to read more from Smith on the latest in Gash's recruitment:\n\nOne team is regaining the momentum for 4-star WR Samson Gash as his final decision nears, via @GregSmithRivals👀\n\nGash is currently committed to Michigan State. \n\nRead: https://t.co/SNUOYVRBfQ pic.twitter.com/gQZBni46sj\n\n— Rivals (@Rivals) January 28, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

    "fullText": "Yes, the Warriors can trade for both Giannis Antetokounmpo and LeBron James. Here's how originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Giannis Antetokounmpo sweepstakes are officially here.\n\nESPN's Shams Charania reported on Wednesday that two-time NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo is \"ready for a new home\" with the Bucks listening to offers ahead of the February 5 trade deadline.\n\nAs you might imagine, it didn't take long for the rumor mill and NBA content machine to crank into hyper drive with seemingly half the league mentioned as a possible suitor. The Heat, Timberwolves, Hawks, Knicks, 76ers, Rockets, Nets and several others have all been most prominently linked to the 31-year-old future Hall of Famer. They all might be tough-pressed to match the Warriors if Mike Dunleavy Jr. puts Golden State's best foot forward.\n\nThat the Warriors are interested in Antetokounmpo should come as no surprise.\n\nWith Jimmy Butler's season-ending torn ACL, Jonathan Kuminga's trade demand, Draymond Green's unwavering commitment to drama-inducing behavior, Steve Kerr's future beyond this season in doubt and Stephen Curry's open frustration with the state of the organization, Golden State's short- and long-term prospects are hanging perilously in the balance.\n\nMORE:Ranking the best Giannis landing spots\n\nOn its own merit, pushing the chips in for Antetokounmpo would be a seismic move unto itself.\n\nBut what if the Warriors dared to dream even bigger? What if Golden State decided that acquiring the Greek Freak wasn't enough to vault back into contention? What if Joe Lacob decided to go for broke and also make a play for LeBron James?\n\nImagine the thought of a Curry-James pick and roll with Giannis waiting in the dunker spot. You'd watch, I'd watch and the those three on the same team would instantly command the respect of every other title contender... regardless of what Curry himself thinks of a potential trade.\n\nThe math works and neither the restrictive aprons nor salary caps would get in the way.\n\nHere is a hypothetical (REPEAT: HYPOTHETICAL) three-team trade that works.\n\n(Editor's note: Fanspo's NBA trade machine is by far the best one out there with updated picks, salaries, restrictions and specific conditional feedback on why trades do or don't work).\n\nWarriors get: Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, Thanasis Antetokounmpo\n\nLakers get: Draymond Green, Myles Turner, Will Richard\n\nBucks get: 4 future first-round picks, 3 pick swaps, Jimmy Butler, Jonathan Kuminga, Brandin Podziemski, Quentin Post\n\nMilwaukee badly needs to restock its draft capital if its going to enter a full rebuild. And of the teams potentially in the market for Giannis, only the Nets can rival Golden State's war chest of future picks.\n\nThe Warriors can offer up to four first-round picks along with three additional swaps. Only three are listed above as the Warriors have a top-20 protected 2030 pick owed to Washington (if that pick falls between 1-20, in this scenario it would go to Milwaukee).\n\nThe Bucks would be hedging against the Warriors' long-term future with picks out as far as 2032 when Curry would be 43, Antetokounmpo 37 and James well into retirement.\n\nButler would presumably be trade bait for next season on an expiring contract, potentially fetching additional draft compensation though his $56.8 million salary would be difficult to move. Kuminga presents an interesting low-risk upside play while this trade also allows them to move off a sizeable and lengthy commitment to Myles Turner.\n\nMORE: Tracking latest Giannis trade rumors\n\nIf the Warriors stand pat, its a signal they are content to ride out Curry's career as a middling fringe playoff or play-in team.\n\nMoving out the picks for Antetokounmpo immediately extends Golden State's window. Such is the reality when you have two of the NBA's top seven players on your roster.\n\nThe LeBron James piece of the equation is where things get really interesting. That bloated $52.6 salary complicates the money going out and Golden State's most realistic path towards getting James after sending out the money required to bring back Antetokounmpo is to include Draymond Green.\n\nThe Warriors could, instead of Green, cobble enough salary to send the Lakers between Buddy Hield, Al Horford and Moses Moody but doing some would strip what little depth remains in the first place. While breaking up the Curry-Green pairing would hurt, its also difficult to imagine Green fitting in at all offensively with Curry, Antetokounmpo AND James.\n\nThat Curry-Green chemistry can't be replicated but if there's one player on the planet with the IQ to pull off a reasonably proxy overnight, its James. Golden State would probably want some assurances that James would come back for at least one more full season, but even if he doesn't, there's not much tread left on Green's tires either.\n\nBeyond the basketball fit, one also wonders if its simply time. If Kerr and the organization at large is simply worn down and ready to move on, perhaps swapping out Green for James may inject some energy back into Steve Kerr.\n\nMORE:Klay Thompson's dad weighed in on the Giannis rumors\n\nThere's a growing sense of frustration within the Lakers and that was before ESPN's bombshell about the Buss family and potential turbulence with the James relationship.\n\nIn this scenario, the Lakers functionally swap James for Turner and Green in a frontcourt overhaul. Both Turner and Green offer significant upgrades defensively, Turner offers some stretchiness from the 5 to open things up for Luka Doncic and Green would surely be motivated to play with an Everest-sized chip on his shoulder.\n\nMORE:LeBron admits 'no way' he imagined playing on Lakers for 8 years\n\nTurner is under contract for three more seasons with the third a player option while Green owns a player option for next season. Moving James now, even for players with longer commitments, also means they won't have the discount haggling sure to happen this season with James and agent Rich Paul. There are already reports that the Lakers would ask James to take a significant discount, something he's in the past shown no willingness to consider.\n\nIf the Lakers did say yes, it probably also means finding a taker for Deandre Ayton who has an $8 million player option for next year but will surely opt out. If the Lakers could turn Ayton into another shooter, they would fully hand the on-ball keys to Doncic and Austin Reaves with more complementary pieces around the fringes.\n\nIs that more exciting than having LeBron James? Absolutely not. But it does give JJ Redick more outs and roster flexibility.\n\nThere's a million reasons trades like this never happen. It's a massive reset involving three teams with onerous contracts, bloated egos, luxury tax and apron implications and so much more.\n\nWill this happen? Almost assuredly not.\n\nCan it happen? Anything is impossible!",

    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO (AP) — Brooks Koepka felt nerves he had not experienced in years. The swagger that was such a hallmark of his five major championships was replaced by concern about the reception he would get upon his return to the PGA Tour after nearly four years on Saudi-funded LIV Golf.\n\nKoepka didn't make a birdie until his final hole Thursday. He failed to break par on the tough South course at Torrey Pines in the Farmers Insurance Open.\n\nAnd there was a small measure of relief.\n\n“I’m just grateful to be out here and have a chance to compete with these guys,” Koepka said.\n\nA large gallery followed him around on a glorious day along the Pacific bluffs with occasional shouts of, “Welcome back, Brooks.” On his way to the second tee, two young boys called out to him and Koepka walked over for fist bumps. He walked the entire 30 yards of a fence where fans wanted his autograph after his 1-over 73.\n\n“I care about what everybody’s thinking out here, what everybody’s doing, and just trying to be as good of a person and good of a player as I can be,” Koepka said. “Just wanted a warm reception. Just like everybody else, you walk into a room, nobody wants to feel exiled. They just want to be loved.”\n\nKoepka was freed from the final year of his nine-figure contract with LIV Golf on Dec. 23, applied for his PGA Tour membership about two weeks later and in three days was provided a path back.\n\nThe hard part was how he would be received. That's what brought the relief, and a big smile even after a round in which he hit the ball cleanly and couldn't buy a putt. The 8-footer for birdie on the 18th was the longest putt he made all day.\n\n“I'm the only one in the entire world that’s going through this situation so it’s very difficult to explain,” Koepka said. “But I’m enjoying it, I really am.”\n\nAnd now he has company, with former Masters champion Patrick Reed leaving LIV Golf with a chance to return to the PGA Tour as early as September. Koepka didn't see that coming and only learned about it during his pro-am Wednesday.\n\n“Yeah, it's wild,” Koepka said. “Whatever Patrick wants to do and to be the best golfer he can be, best for his family, I'm in full support of that.”\n\nKoepka said he felt nervous on the first tee, though it didn't show. He piped his drive 301 yards at sea level into the fairway, one of his better iron shots of the day to 10 feet and missed his putt.\n\n“I guess I should have been more nervous the rest of the round,” Koepka said.\n\nThe South course is among the strongest on the PGA Tour, producing more pars than any excitement. Koepka missed birdie chances on both par 5s on the front nine, and he made a sloppy bogey on the par-5 13th when his flip wedge up the steep hill to a flag he couldn't see was too strong and went into the rough behind the green.\n\nHe was 11 shots behind Justin Rose, who had a 62 on the easier North course, and eight shots worse than Seamus Power, who had a 65 for the low score on the South.\n\n“It’s been a while since I played competitive golf, so I like the way I’m playing,” said Koepka, who last played Oct. 5 at the Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland. “I just need to kind of play my way into it.”\n\nHis departure to LIV Golf in 2022 — one of the biggest surprises among the players who left the PGA Tour for the guaranteed Saudi riches — felt much longer ago. Koepka couldn't recall if he heard any comments outside the ropes in Portland when he made his LIV debut.\n\nAnd he wasn't sure what to expect in San Diego.\n\n“I don’t like thinking ahead at all or trying to anticipate what was going to happen, but I wasn’t sure, which is kind of weird being uneasy,” he said. “From the first tee on, it was great. It actually made me settle down a little bit. Like I said, it made me feel good just to be out here.”\n\nKoepka is in the Phoenix Open next week. He is not in the $20 million signature events unless he qualifies. His return also stipulates a $5 million charity donation, no access to PGA Tour equity shares for five years, no FedEx Cup bonus money he might earn this year.\n\nThe tour also said whenever Koepka plays he will be added to the field to not take a spot from anyone. And then two more players get into tournaments on Monday of tournament week to make sure every group is a threesome.\n\nThe two beneficiaries this week were Jackson Suber and Lanto Griffin, a big deal to Griffin because Torrey Pines is his favorite course and he otherwise would not be in except for Koepka.\n\nThat led Griffin to say jokingly, “If Brooks really wants to create some goodwill, he should enter every tournament and then withdraw on Tuesday.”\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",

I didn't hit enough fairways ... didn't really make any putts besides 18 right there.\n\n\"It's been a while since I played competitive golf, so I like the way I'm playing, I just need to kind of play my way into it.\"\n\nKoepka's move back to the PGA Tour, which had banned players that jumped to LIV, comes under a new returning member program that includes limitations on eligibility for some top events, and a five-year forfeiture of rights to participate in the PGA's player equity program.\n\nKoepka, who is also making a $5 million charitable donation as one of the conditions of his reinstatement, said the speed at which the puzzle pieces fell in place had \"kind of blown my mind.\"\n\n\"I'm just grateful to be out here and have a chance to compete with these guys,\" he said.\n\nHe'll need to go low on Friday to have a chance to make the cut.\n\nRose, the 2013 US Open champion, torched the North Course with 10 birdies, just missing an 11th at his final hole, the par-five ninth, that would have given him the course record.\n\n\"It's funny how you can walk off frustrated for sure,\" said Rose, who said he second-guessed himself on the tricky birdie putt.\n\n\"But, listen, I made my share out there today. My process was fantastic. I feel like I managed my game really, really well today.\n\n\"I didn't feel like I played perfect golf so it's a good reminder that you don't always have to play perfect golf but it was good enough,\" added Rose, who was one stroke in front of American Justin Lower.\n\nJapan's Hideki Matsuyama picked up five strokes in his last five holes with an eagle and three birdies to grab a share of third on eight-under 64, tied with American Max Greyserman.\n\nIreland's Seamus Power had the round of the day on the South Course, carding a seven-under 65 to share fifth place alongside Germany's Stephan Jaeger and American Maverick McNealy.",

    "description": "In his return from LIV Golf, Brooks Koepka got a welcoming reception in the Farmers Insurance Open while shooting 73 on the South Course",
    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO — The temperature at Torrey Pines already had risen to an inviting mid-60s at 9:30 a.m. on Thursday when Brooks Koepka stepped onto the first tee of the South Course. The weather was unseasonably warm and comfortable, with not a cloud in the sky—basically mirroring the feeling and reception the five-time major winner got as he returned to the PGA Tour after a 3½-year absence while competing on LIV Golf.\n\nMORE: The other side of Brooks Koepka\n\nMaybe it was just sleepy morning for fans on the cliffs above the Pacific Ocean, but there were no wild cheers from a gallery of a couple hundred. A few people shouted, “Love you, Brooks,” and others offered, “welcome back!” Koepka’s group partner, past Farmers Open winner Max Homa, drew louder support.\n\nOn the other hand—and probably more meaningful to Koepka—there was not a single audible jeer for the man who was among the most high-profile American players to depart for a controversial league while making more than $150 million doing it. The only heckling Koepka seemed to get was after the round when an obnoxious man loudly and repeatedly asked him to sign a golf ball following the golfer spending 15 minutes working along an autograph line of mostly kids. \"I'm your biggest fan!\" the guy bellowed, but that still didn't get him a signature.\n\nKoepka would admit after the round that he was feeling more nervous than he had in quite a while but hardly looked shaky while striping his opening drive into the fairway.\n\nA page turned on a new chapter of his life.\n\n“Yeah, it was great. The fans were awesome today,” Koepka said. “I think it was very cool to hear ‘welcome back.’ It was pretty much every hole, which is great. I loved to hear it and I'm excited for the next few days.”\n\nHe admitted why he was concerned about the reaction.\n\n“I just cared about my perception, what people thought or what the fans thought,” he said. “It's easy when you're around the players and they come and talk to you or you talk to them, or caddies or people around here, but everybody else, I wasn't sure.”\n\nWhile saying he was feeling jitters on the first tee, Koepka deadpanned, “I guess I should have been more nervous the rest of the round.\" He made only one birdie—on the 18th hole—in shooting one-over-par 73 on the two-time U.S. Open course.\n\nTied for 101st place after Round 1, Koepka could perhaps take solace in being even with his former U.S. Ryder Cup teammates, Xander Schauffee and Patrick Cantlay, and defending Farmers Open champion Harris English. He also bested his two playing partners, with Homa shooting 75 and Ludvig Aberg, who won the Genesis Invitational at Torrey Pines last February, struggling to a 78.\n\nThat’s how tough the South Course is and Koepka was playing his first competitive round since the DP World Tour’s Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in early October.\n\n“It felt good,” said Koepka, who hit only six fairways, but more than doubled his greens reached with 13. “It's been a while since I played competitive golf, so I like the way I'm playing; I just need to kind of play my way into it.”\n\nOne of the primary reasons, Kopeka has said, for his return to the PGA Tour is the desire to spend more time with his family, and he said his wife, Jena Sims, and their 3½-year-old son, Crew, would be out at Torrey Pines this week. They weren't on the grounds on Thursday but can be expected later in the week.\n\nAs it was for Tuesday’s news conference, Koepka’s demeanor was seemingly a blend of restraint and earnestness. At one point, he said he had “fallen back in love with the game” while watching Crew begin to show interest in it.\n\n“I guess I want him to watch me play well,” he said, “and realize how much this game’s given me, how fun it is, and how cool it is to just be out here.”",

    "description": "The Steve Aoki concert cake throw is a signature for the Grammy-nominated DJ, and a guest appearance by Diego Lopes stands out.",
    "fullText": "Steve Aoki is a major UFC fan, so much so that he's invited multiple fighters on stage at his concerts through the years, and also DJ'd the wedding of former bantamweight champion Aljamain Sterling.\n\nThe Grammy-nominated artist and producer moved his schedule around to attend this past Saturday's UFC 324 event in Las Vegas and has a number of favorites on the roster. One name repeatedly came to Aoki's mind when discussing his UFC fandom with MMA Junkie on the UFC 324 red carpet, especially when asked who he thinks has done the best cake throw into the crowd, which is a signature of his performances.\n\nThat man is UFC 325 headliner Diego Lopes (27-7 MMA, 6-2 UFC), who faces Alexander Volkanovski (27-4 MMA, 14-3 UFC) in a rematch for the featherweight title Saturday at Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney (Paramount+).\n\n\"Diego, I would have to say, was very impressive,\" Aoki told MMA Junkie. \"We were in Mexico together, and I played in Puebla in his city where he trains. This was the second time we caked. We did it before when he was with me in Guadalajara. The crowd was at least 25 feet away. I did not think he was going to make it over there, because it's difficult.\n\n\"There's a real art to cake throwing. It's not like you can pick up a cake, and you can actually nail someone in the face. It's actually difficult. He actually launched it, and it got some head shots. I was impressed. There is evidence of him nailing some amazing head shots. So I think Diego is one of the best fighting IQs, for sure, for me when I watch him, and he definitely has the cake IQ, too.\"\n\nLopes shared the video of the cake throw Aoki mentioned from November 2024. He still holds up the spot as No. 1 cake thrower more than a year later, and now he'll try to add the distinction of No. 1 featherweight in the world to his resume, as well.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: DJ Steve Aoki names Diego Lopes as best UFC cake thrower",

Via a press release, this will mark the first time a Super Bowl and Olympic Games will be presented in 4K HDR on the NBC broadcast network and the Peacock.\n\nIn a statement, Rick Cordella, President of NBC Sports, believes that because February will be a huge month for sports for the network, they feel obligated to deliver the best viewing experience possible.\n\n“When you’re about to present the biggest month in U.S. sports media history, you want to make sure you’re giving fans the best experience possible – so that’s exactly what we have planned on NBC and Peacock for Super Bowl LX, the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, and NBA All-Star Weekend,” said Cordella. “Building on NBC Sports’ long-standing commitment to innovation across all platforms, we’ll be celebrating the action on the field, slopes, and court with our signature storytelling, state-of-the-art production, and dynamic streaming features that together bring these incredible sporting events to life for audiences at home.”\n\nThe platform will be presenting other innovations with their Olympic coverage by expanding their Multiview feature to mobile, which activates a four-box vertical display that showcases the top four events at any given time. Patrick Miceli, Chief Technology Officer, NBCUniversal Media Group and Global Streaming, states Peacock leads the industry in preesnting high profile events due to their infrastructure.\n\n“Peacock is the first streamer to deliver major live sports at this scale, seamlessly presenting many simultaneous events, with millions of people coming to the platform at once, over several days,” said Patrick Miceli, Chief Technology Officer, NBCUniversal Media Group and Global Streaming. “This impressive performance is possible because of Peacock’s industry-leading infrastructure that supports unmatched reliability, especially under peak demand.”\n\nPeacock’s February doesn’t stop with the Olympics and the Super Bowl, as for the first time in over 20 years, NBC will produce NBA All-Star Weekend onsite in Los Angeles.",

    "fullText": "“No Mercy” will be on ice for a bit — literally and figuratively.\n\nTwo-time Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Bantamweight champion Petr Yan will be out of action until at least summer 2026 after undergoing a minor back procedure, a development that was confirmed by his longtime manager, Danny Rubenstein.\n\n“He had a minor procedure on his lower back that he went into the Merab fight with,” Rubenstein told MMA Junkie recently. “He’ll be ready in July.”\n\nWhile the surgery is considered minor, it makes his performance last month even more impressive as the Russian standout powered through the issue and reclaimed the Bantamweight title with a dominant victory over Merab Dvalishvili at UFC 323, extending his winning streak to four straight.\n\nThe timing of the injury is unfortunate for fans, as Yan is widely regarded as one of the most skilled and entertaining fighters in the division. However, the layoff does allow both Yan and Dvalishvili ample time to recover and prepare for what appears to be an inevitable rubber match later this year.\n\nThe setback also eliminates any chance of Yan competing on the historic UFC White House card scheduled for June, a bout many had speculated could include a rematch against former champion Sean O’Malley. With Yan unavailable, “Sugar” will have to look elsewhere if he hopes to secure a spot on that high-profile event.\n\nIf the promotion wants to get wonky, an interim title fight involving O’Malley isn’t out of the question — setting up a unification bout once Yan returns to full health. Whether the UFC goes that route remains to be seen.\n\nFor now, the priority is Yan’s recovery. Assuming everything goes according to plan, the Bantamweight king should be back in the title picture by midsummer — and when he returns, the division will once again have its most dangerous technician at full strength.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhen the Denver Broncos abruptly fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi this week, it sure seemed like a move to help ensure that they didn't lose quarterbacks coach Davis Webb.\n\nThe Broncos have yet to officially name Webb the team's new offensive coordinator, but they need to do that as soon as possible. Webb is reportedly taking his name out of consideration to be the next head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders, so that could pave the way for that.\n\nNix called his own press conference to address his broken ankle, clearing up and correcting some of what Payton said following the injury.\n\nDid not have Bo Nix calling his own press conference & addressing Sean Payton’s over sharing of his injuries on today’s bingo card.

The two have had heated spats during games before, so if you want to chalk this latest story up to anything minor, you're badly missing the boat.\n\nThis is something that could become a serious disturbance for this team. The Broncos have a strong head coach and a great young quarterback, but are they on the same page? Do they like working together?\n\nThis is where Webb comes in. He is that bridge between the coach and the player and he will be the glue that keeps what the team has going together. That makes him a guy the Broncos can't allow to get out the door.\n\nAccording to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, the Broncos were looking to offer their offensive coordinator job to Joe Brady, who was hired as the new head coach of the Buffalo Bills. Hours later, the Broncos fired Lombardi, seemingly paving the way for Webb to be promoted into that role.\n\nREAD:Broncos' two huge offseason signings could already be on their way out\n\nNow that Webb is apparently taking himself out of the running for the Raiders job, the Broncos need to make it official.\n\nBroncos' Vance Joseph may be down to just one possibility to be head coach in 2026\n\nBroncos sign Deuce Vaughn, 6 other players to future contracts\n\nBroncos Schedule: Which opponents will Denver face in 2026?\n\nBroncos must do everything in their power to sign 27-TD free-agent running back",

    "fullText": "A docuseries examining the evolution and impact of Black quarterbacks in professional football, Field Generals: History of the Black Quarterback, will debut on Peacock on Thursday, Feb. 5. New episodes will stream weekly on Thursdays, chronicling the stories of trailblazing quarterbacks from the AFL-NFL merger through the turn of the century who faced systemic barriers and cultural challenges while reshaping one of the most scrutinized positions in sports.\n\nThe series explores how Black quarterbacks were often steered away from the position, questioned for their leadership and intelligence, and forced to overcome entrenched stereotypes both on and off the field. Through archival footage, interviews and historical context, Field Generals traces how these athletes helped redefine what success at quarterback looks like in the NFL and paved the way for future generations.\n\nNBC Sports’ Maria Taylor serves as an executive producer alongside Michael Yarvitz, Bill Wolff, Andrew Singer and Eddie Michaels. Rikki Hughes serves as both director and executive producer. The docuseries is produced in association with NFL Films, with Jessica Boddy, Keith Cossrow, Ken Rodgers and Ross Ketover serving as executive producers.\n\nThe series features firsthand perspectives from a wide range of former and current Black quarterbacks, including James “Shack” Harris, Warren Moon, Doug Williams, Randall Cunningham, Vince Evans, Chuck Ealey, Rodney Peete, Donovan McNabb, Michael Vick and Lamar Jackson.\n\nAdditional voices include journalists, executives, and cultural commentators who help frame the broader social and historical significance of the position, such as Michael Wilbon, Rich McKay, Joe Gibbs, Michael Eric Dyson, Jayne Kennedy, Bomani Jones, Michael Beschloss and Bob Costas.\n\nThe series trailer can be viewed here.",

Webb interviewed for head coaching jobs with the Raiders, Bills and Ravens. pic.twitter.com/4FYpPGQ0MX\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 30, 2026\n\nDavis Webb was considered a favorite for the Las Vegas Raiders head coaching job, but all signs point to them favoring Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak instead. Both the Cardinals and the Raiders are waiting until this weekend to meet with him in hopes of hiring him after the Super Bowl. With the writing on the wall and likely not wanting to be the backup option, Webb withdrew his name from consideration.\n\nWith Webb officially out of the Raiders’ head coaching search, he becomes one of the hottest offensive coordinator names currently on the market. Several teams, including the Baltimore Ravens, New York Giants, and Philadelphia Eagles (before they hired their OC earlier today) have already put in requests to interview Webb for their offensive coordinator positions. Also, his current team, the Denver Broncos, fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi and would like to promote Webb to offensive coordinator if possible.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Webb will interview with the Ravens, Giants, or any other teams for their offensive coordinator jobs. He has impressed in interviews, is viewed as an up-and-coming coach, and is well-liked and regarded around the league so it would make sense for teams to be interested. However, with the Broncos firing Lombardi and opening up their offensive coordinator position, you have to assume there is mutual interest between the two sides and that the Broncos are the favorites to land him as their offensive coordinator.\n\nWebb would benefit from another year under Sean Payton and would get more valuable experience as his offensive coordinator. While he may not call plays, he would be in the booth, communicating with Payton throughout the game, and would be a key part of game-planning each week.\n\nThere is no guarantee that Webb will return to the Broncos, as other teams can and likely will offer him play-calling opportunities, but I believe they will make a strong push for him. This should unfold in the coming days, and hopefully, Webb returns to the Broncos, this time, as their offensive coordinator.",

    "fullText": "While the top two teams in the NFL prepare for the Super Bowl, the Dallas Cowboys and 29 other squads are firmly fixated on talent acquisition. From coaching staff to free agency to the 2026 NFL draft, the Cowboys are treasure hunting.\n\nMidway through Senior Bowl week, some draft hopefuls are standing out amongst their peers. The hope for Cowboys fans is that some of these standouts are at positions of need for Dallas. The Cowboys need to add players at linebacker, defensive end, safety, offensive tackle and cornerback, just to name a few. As luck would have it, some of those players are indeed flashing in practice.\n\nEarly standout reports have highlighted the defensive ends who have been jumping off the screen. The one’s mentioned here at Cowboys Wire have continued their strong play and should firmly be on Dallas’ radar this April. Today we look at three more.\n\nBud Clark has been turning heads here at the midpoint. The 6-foot-1, 185-pound safety from TCU was an intriguing prospect from the start. Over the past two seasons, he’s scored the third best film grade in the country. Despite a diminutive stature, Clark has been showing up as a run defender in the box, putting to bed some size concerns about his jump to the NFL.\n\nClark has been making plays on the ball in coverage and filling gaps against the run, proving to be a do-it-all defensive back. In 2023 he played 393 snaps in the slot, but over the last two seasons he’s mixed it up evenly between slot, box and deep.\n\nClark is the ideal candidate to replace free agent Donovan Wilson for the Cowboys because he can be moved everywhere including a nickel role. Clark is rocketing up draft boards and should move into the top 100 (currently a consensus rank of 185)\n\nDeath, taxes, Bud Clark making plays at the Senior Bowl.\n\nTCU safety has been a star all week. pic.twitter.com/nm3nZWRlwP\n\n— Max Chadwick (@CFBMaxChadwick) January 29, 2026\n\nJacob Rodriguez has proven he’s every bit as advertised. The Tech standout has been everywhere on the field, picking off balls in coverage and punching out balls in the open field. In this extremely deep LB class, Rodriguez is a star.\n\nPhysical traits stand to hold him back on draft boards, but the kid is a mental giant who just makes plays. Rodriguez has set the bar at the LB position scoring the highest PFF score all time amongst Power-4 LB prospects. Given he’ll probably be a Day 2 pick, he’s going to be a steal for someone this year.\n\nTexas Tech’s Jacob Rodriguez had an all-time performance for a LB on Day 2 of the Senior Bowl. \n\nNot only did he show off his peanut punch with a forced fumble, but he also had an INT to end the day and was the best LB in coverage in one-on-ones pic.twitter.com/W8yEm4F2k7\n\n— Bobby Football (@Rob__Paul) January 29, 2026\n\nAt just under 6-foot and weighing 183 pounds, Malik Mohammad isn’t the typical tall CB the Cowboys are attracted to but he’s making it up in tenacity and stickiness at the Senior Bowl. Quick and fluid, Muhammad has shown he can stay with any build, both outside and inside.\n\nThe Cowboys are in the market for a new CB with inside ability. They felt the loss of Jourdan Lewis immensely and this prospect appears to be a great replacement option.\n\nMalik Muhammad continues to stack good rep after good rep pic.twitter.com/AQNk9J2Poz\n\n— TJ Wengert (@TJWengert) January 28, 2026\n\nYou can follow Reid on X @ReidDHanson and be sure to follow Cowboys Wire on Facebook to join in on the conversation with fellow fans!\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Midway checkpoint: 3 local Senior Bowl standouts who fit the Cowboys",

    "fullText": "Modern neuroscience understands the brain as a set of specialized systems. Aspects of brain function such as attention, perception, memory, language and thought have been mapped onto distinct brain networks, and each has been examined largely in isolation.\n\nWhile this approach has yielded major advances, it has left unresolved one of the most basic facts about human cognition: its overall unity as an integrated system.\n\nNow, researchers at the University of Notre Dame have conducted a neuroimaging study to investigate how the brain is organized and how that integrated system gives rise to intelligence.\n\n“Neuroscience has been very successful at explaining what particular networks do, but much less successful at explaining how a single, coherent mind emerges from their interaction,” said Aron Barbey, the Andrew J. McKenna Family Professor of Psychology in Notre Dame’s Department of Psychology.\n\nPsychologists have long known that areas as diverse as attention, perception, memory and language are correlated, forming what they term “general intelligence.” This accounts for how humans function and adapt in a wide range of academic, professional, social and health contexts. It shapes how efficiently we learn, reason and perform in response to a multitude of everyday problems and tasks.\n\nFor more than a century, this structure has suggested that cognition is unified at a fundamental level. What has been missing is a theory to explain why such unity exists.\n\n“The problem of intelligence is not one of functional localization,” said Barbey, who is also the director of the Notre Dame Human Neuroimaging Center and the Decision Neuroscience Laboratory. “Contemporary research often asks where general intelligence originates in the brain — focusing primarily on a specific network of regions within the frontal and parietal cortex. But the more fundamental question is how intelligence emerges from the principles that govern global brain function — how distributed networks communicate and collectively process information.”\n\nBarbey and his research team, including Notre Dame graduate student and lead author Ramsey Wilcox, investigated the predictions of the unifying framework, called the Network Neuroscience Theory. Their study was recently published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nGeneral intelligence is not itself a skill or strategy, the researchers argued. It is a pattern — the tendency for diverse abilities to be positively correlated. The study argues that this pattern reflects differences in how efficiently brain networks are organized and work together.\n\nTo test this claim, the cognitive neuroscientists analyzed brain imaging and cognitive data from one of the largest studies conducted to date, examining 831 adults in the Human Connectome Project, along with an independent sample of 145 adults in the INSIGHT Study, which was funded by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity’s SHARP program. The researchers integrated measures of both brain structure and function to enable a more precise characterization of the human brain.\n\nRather than identifying intelligence with a particular cognitive function or brain network, the Network Neuroscience Theory characterizes it as a property of how the brain works as a whole. In this view, intelligence reflects how brain networks are coordinated and dynamically reconfigured to solve the diverse problems we encounter in life.\n\nThis research represents an important shift, according to Barbey and Wilcox.\n\n“We found evidence for system-wide coordination in the brain that is both robust and adaptable,” Wilcox said. “This coordination does not carry out cognition itself, but determines the range of cognitive operations the system can support.”\n\n“Within this framework, the brain is modeled as a network whose behavior is constrained by global properties such as efficiency, flexibility and integration,” Wilcox said. “These properties are not tied to individual tasks or brain networks, but are characteristics of the system as a whole, shaping every cognitive operation without being reducible to any one of them.”\n\n“Once the question shifts from where intelligence is to how the system is organized,” Wilcox noted, “the empirical targets change.”\n\nThe researchers found evidence to support four predictions of the Network Neuroscience Theory.\n\nFirst, the theory predicts that intelligence is not localized to a single brain network but arises from processing distributed across multiple networks. Intelligence, therefore, depends on how the brain manages the division of labor across different networks and combines them as needed.\n\nSecond, for the brain to manage this distributed processing, it requires integration and effective long-range communications. To synchronize those efforts, Barbey said, there is “a large and complex system of connections that serve as ‘shortcuts’ linking distant brain regions and integrating information across the networks.” These pathways connect structurally distant areas of the brain, enabling efficient communication and supporting coordinated processing across the system.\n\nThird, effective integration requires regulatory control that coordinates interactions among networks by shaping how information flows throughout the brain. These areas serve as regulatory hubs, reaching out to other networks to orchestrate the brain’s ongoing activities. They selectively recruit the appropriate networks for the specific task at hand — whether it be piecing together subtle clues to make sense of a problem, learning a new skill or deciding whether a situation requires careful deliberation or a rapid, intuitive response.\n\nFinally, Barbey said that general intelligence depends on the brain’s ability to balance local specialization with global integration. In other words, the brain functions best when tightly connected local clusters communicate well, but are still able to link to distant regions of the brain across short communication paths. This makes the most effective problem-solving possible, according to the co-authors.\n\nThe research suggests that intelligence is unified not because the brain relies on a single general-purpose processor, but because the same organizational principles shape how all cognitive functions work together.\n\nAcross both datasets, individual differences in general intelligence were consistently associated with these system-level properties. No single region or canonical “intelligence network” accounted for the effect.\n\n“General intelligence becomes visible when cognition is coordinated,” Barbey noted, “when many processes must work together under system-level constraints.”\n\nThe implications of this study extend beyond intelligence research, he added. By grounding cognition in large-scale organization, the study offers a principled account of why the mind is unified at all.\n\nThis framework helps explain why intelligence develops broadly during childhood, declines with aging and is particularly sensitive to diffuse brain injury. In each case, it is large-scale coordination — not isolated function — that changes.\n\nThe findings also inform ongoing debates about artificial intelligence and how AI models are developed. If general intelligence in humans arises from system-level organization rather than from a dedicated general-purpose mechanism, then achieving general intelligence in artificial systems may require more than the accumulation or scaling of specialized capabilities.\n\n“This research can push us into thinking about how to use design characteristics of the human brain to motivate advances in human-centered, biologically inspired artificial intelligence,” Barbey said.\n\n“Many AI systems can perform specific tasks very well, but they still struggle to apply what they know across different situations.” Barbey said. “Human intelligence is defined by this flexibility — and it reflects the unique organization of the human brain.”\n\nThe research was conducted with co-authors Babak Hemmatian and Lav Varshney of Stony Brook University.\n\nContact: Tracy DeStazio, associate director of media relations, 574-631-9958 or tdestazi@nd.edu",

    "description": "Two Army pilots went on an ill-conceived training mission. Within two hours, 67 people were dead.",
    "fullText": "This article was featured in New York’s One Great Story newsletter. \n\nOne year ago, on January 29, 2025, two Army pilots strapped into a Black Hawk helicopter for a training mission out of Fort Belvoir in eastern Virginia and, two hours later, flew it into an airliner that was approaching Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing all 67 aboard both aircraft. It was the deadliest air disaster in the United States in a quarter-century. Normally, in the aftermath of an air crash, government investigators take a year or more to issue a final report laying out the reasons the incident occurred. But in this case, the newly seated U.S. president, Donald Trump, held a press conference the next day and blamed the accident on the FAA’s DEI under the Biden and Obama administrations. “They actually came out with a directive, ‘too white,’” he claimed. “And we want the people that are competent.”\n\nIn the months that followed, major media outlets probed several real-world factors that contributed to the tragedy, including staffing shortages at FAA towers, an excess of traffic in the D.C. airspace, and the failure of the Black Hawk to broadcast its location over ADS-B — an automatic reporting system — before the collision. To address this final point, the Senate last month passed the bipartisan ROTOR Act, which would require all aircraft to use ADS-B — “a fitting way to honor the lives of those lost nearly one year ago over the Potomac River,” as bill co-sponsor Ted Cruz put it.\n\nAt a public meeting on Tuesday, the National Transport Safety Board laid out a list of recommended changes in response to the crash, criticizing the FAA for allowing helicopters to operate dangerously close to passenger planes and for allowing professional standards to slip at the control tower.\n\nWhat has gone unexamined in the public discussion of the crash, however, is why these particular pilots were on this mission in the first place, whether they were competent to do what they were trying to do, what adverse conditions they were facing, and who was in charge at the moment of impact. Ultimately, while systemic issues may have created conditions that were ripe for a fatal accident, it was human decision-making in the cockpit that was the immediate cause of this particular crash.\n\nThis account is based on documents from the National Transportation Board (NTSB) accident inquiry and interviews with aviation experts. It shows that, when we focus on the specific details and facts of a case, the cause can seem quite different from what a big-picture overview might indicate. And this, in turn, suggests different logical steps that should be taken to prevent such a tragedy from happening again.\n\nThe whine of the Blackhawk’s engine increased in pitch, and the whump-whump of its four rotor blades grew louder, as the matte-black aircraft lifted into the darkened sky above the single mile-long runway at Davison Army Airfield in Fairfax County, Virginia, about 25 miles southwest of Washington, D.C.\n\nThe UH-60, as it’s formally designated, is an 18,000-pound aircraft that entered service in 1979 as a tactical transport aircraft, used primarily for moving troops and equipment. This one belonged to Company B of the 12th Aviation Battalion, whose primary mission is to transport government VIPs, including Defense Department officials, members of Congress, and visiting dignitaries. Tonight’s flight would operate as PAT 25, for “Priority Air Transit.”\n\nBlack Hawks are typically flown by two pilots. The pilot in command, or PIC, sits in the right-hand seat. Tonight, that role was filled by 39-year-old chief warrant officer Andrew Eaves. Warrant officers rank between enlisted personnel and commissioned officers; it’s the warrant officers who carry out the lion’s share of a unit’s operational flying. When not flying VIPs, Eaves served as a flight instructor and a check pilot, providing periodic evaluation of the skills of other pilots. A native of Mississippi, he had 968 hours of flight experience and was considered a solid pilot by others in the unit.\n\nBefore he took off, Eaves’ commander had discussed the flight with him and admonished him to “not become too fixated on his evaluator role” and to remain “in control of the helicopter,” according to the NTSB investigation.\n\nHis mission was to give a check ride to Captain Rebecca Lobach, the pilot sitting in the left-hand seat. Lobach was a staff officer, meaning that her main role in the battalion was managerial. Nevertheless, she was expected to maintain her pilot qualifications and, to do so, had to undergo a number of annual proficiency checks. Tonight’s three-hour flight was intended to get Lobach her annual sign-off for basic flying skills and for the use of night-vision goggles, or NVGs. To accommodate that, the flight was taking off an hour and 20 minutes after sunset.\n\nBoth pilots wore AN/AVS-6(V)3 Night Vision Goggles, which look like opera glasses and clip onto the front of a pilot’s helmet. They gather ambient light, whether from the moon or stars or from man-made sources; intensify it; and display it through the lens of each element. The eyepiece doesn’t sit directly on the face but about an inch away, so the pilot can look down under it and see the instrument panel.\n\nNight-vision goggles have a narrow field of view, just 40 degrees compared to the 200-degree range of normal vision, which makes it harder for pilots to maintain full situational awareness. They have to pay attention to obstacles and other aircraft outside the window, and they also have to keep track of what the gauges on the panel in front them are saying: how fast they’re going, for instance, and how high. There’s a lot to process, and time is of the essence when you’re zooming along at 120 mph while lower than the tops of nearby buildings. To help with situational awareness, Eaves and Lobach were accompanied by a crew chief, Staff Sergeant Ryan O’Hara, sitting in a seat just behind the cockpit, where he would be able to help keep an eye out for trouble.\n\nThe helicopter turned to the south as it climbed, then flew along the eastern shore of the Potomac until the point where the river makes a big bend to the east. Eaves banked to the right and headed west toward the commuter suburb of Vicksburg, where the lights of house porches and street lamps seemed to twinkle as they fell in and out of the cover of the bare tree branches.\n\nPAT 25 followed the serpentine course of the Rapidan River through the hills and farm fields of the Piedmont. At this point, Eaves was not only the pilot in command, but also the pilot flying, meaning that he had his hands on the controls that guide the aircraft’s speed and direction and his feet on the rudder pedals that keep the helicopter “in trim” — that is, lined up with its direction of flight. Lobach played a supporting role, working the radio, keeping an eye out for obstacles and other traffic, and figuring out their location by referencing visible landmarks.\n\nLobach, 28, had been a pilot for four years. She’d been an ROTC cadet at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which she graduated from in 2019. Both her parents were doctors; she’d dreamed of a medical career but eventually realized that she couldn’t pursue one in the Army. According to her roommate, “She did not have a huge, massive passion” for aviation but chose it because it was the closest she could get to practicing medicine, under the circumstances. “She badly wanted to be a Black Hawk pilot because she wanted to be a medevac unit,” he told NTSB investigators. After she completed flight training at Fort Rucker, she was stationed at Fort Belvoir, where she joined the 12th Aviation Battalion and was put in charge of the oil-and-lubricants unit. One fellow pilot in the unit described her to the NTSB as “incredibly professional, very diligent and very thorough.”\n\nIn addition to her official duties, Lobach served as a volunteer social liaison at the White House, where she regularly represented the Army at Medal of Honor ceremonies and state dinners. She was both a fitness fanatic and a baker, known for providing fresh sourdough bread to her unit. She had started dabbling in real-estate investments and looked forward to moving in with her boyfriend of one year, another Army pilot with whom she talked about having “lots and lots of babies.” She was planning to leave the service in 2027 and had already applied for medical school at Mount Sinai. Helicopter flying was not something she intended to pursue.\n\nThough talented as a manager, she wasn’t much of a pilot. Helicopter flying is an extremely demanding feat of coordination and balance, akin to juggling and riding a unicycle at the same time. For Lobach, the difficulty was compounded by the fact that she had trained on highly automated, relatively easy-to-fly helicopters at Fort Rucker and then been assigned to an older aircraft, the Black Hawk L or “Lima” model, at Fort Belvoir. Unlike newer models, which can maintain their altitude on autopilot, the Lima requires constant care and attention, and Lobach struggled to master it. One instructor described her skills as “well below average,” noting that she had “lots of difficulties in the aircraft.” Three years before, she’d failed the night-vision evaluation she was taking tonight.\n\nBefore the flight, Eaves had told his girlfriend that he was concerned about Lobach’s capability as a pilot and that, skill-wise, she was “not where she should be.”\n\nIt’s not uncommon for pilots to struggle during the early phase of their career. But Lobach’s development had been particularly slow. In her five years in the service, she had accumulated just 454 hours of flight time, and she wasn’t clocking more very quickly. The Army requires officers in her role to fly at least 60 hours a year, but in the past 12 months, she’d flown only 56.7. Her superiors had made an exception for her because in March she’d had knee surgery for a sports injury, preventing her from flying for three months. The waiver made her technically qualified to fly, but it didn’t change the fact that she was rustier than pilots were normally allowed to become.\n\nIf she’d been keen on flying, she could have used every moment of this flight to hone her skills by taking the controls herself. But she was content to let Eaves do the flying during the first part of the trip.\n\nDrawing near to Greenhouse Airport, a small, private grass runway near a plant nursery, they navigated via an old-fashioned technique called pilotage, using landmarks and dead reckoning to find their way from point to point. Coming in for their first landing of the night, they were looking for the airstrip’s signature greenhouse complex.\n\nLobach: That large lit building may be part of it.\n\nEaves: It does look like a greenhouse, doesn’t it?\n\nLobach: Yeah, it does, doesn’t it? We can start slowing back.\n\nEaves: All right, slowing back.\n\nAs they circled around the runway, Eaves commented that the lighting of the greenhouse building was so intense that it was blinding in the NVGs, and Lobach agreed. Eaves positioned the helicopter a few hundred feet above the landing zone and asked Lobach to show him where it was. After she did so correctly, he told her to take the controls. This process followed a formalized set of acknowledgements to make sure that both parties understood who was in control of the aircraft.\n\nEaves: You’ve got the flight controls.\n\nAs Lobach eased the helicopter toward the ground, Eaves and Crew Chief O’Hara called out times from the landing checklist.\n\nO’Hara: Clear of obstacles on the left.\n\nLobach: Thank you. Coming forward.\n\nThey touched down. One minute and 42 seconds after passing control to Lobach, Eaves took it back again. As they sat on the ground with their rotor whirring, they discussed the fuel remaining aboard the aircraft and the direction they would travel in during the next segment of their flight. Finally, after six minutes, Eaves signaled that they were ready to take off again.\n\nEaves: Whenever you’re ready, ma’am.\n\nEaves’s deference to Lobach was symptomatic of what is known among psychologists as an “inverted authority gradient.” Although he was the pilot in command, both responsible for the flight and in a position of authority over others on it, Eaves held a lesser rank than Lobach and so in a broader context was her subordinate. In moments of high stress, this ambiguity can muddy the waters as to who is supposed to be making crucial decisions.\n\nEaves, Lobach, and O’Hara ran through their checklists, and Eaves eased the Black Hawk up into the night sky.\n\nThey headed north, bending to the east to avoid Culpeper Airport to their left. The scattering of lights beneath them was sparse as they passed over the rural foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Cruising at an altitude of 2,000 feet, the aircraft hit rough air.\n\nIt was a complaint Lobach continued to make throughout the night. A cold front was moving through the area, bringing winds that gusted up to 45 mph. The wind wasn’t dangerous, but it kept pushing the aircraft off its flight path and caused constant unexpected jerks. It was another stress factor in a night that already had plenty.\n\nTwo minutes later, Lobach declared that she was taking control of the aircraft. Eaves sounded surprised.\n\nLobach: I got the flight controls.\n\nEaves: Yup, you got flight controls.\n\nEaves: You do have flight controls. Sorry about that.\n\nLobach pointed out that they had descended below their intended altitude of 2,000 feet and were now at 1,600 feet. Eaves was confused, then realized that he had misread the altimeter display.\n\nThe fact that Eaves would make such a mistake is a reminder that, while he was a much more experienced and proficient pilot than Lobach, he, too, was a pilot with less than a thousand hours of flight time. In order to even start a career as an airline pilot in the U.S., you need a minimum of 1,500 hours.\n\nThe 12th Aviation Battalion is an elite unit with a glamorous and high-stakes mission: flying government officials and VIPs around in the nation’s capital. A decade ago, it was staffed by experienced aviators who would build flight time elsewhere before being transferred to the unit. But in recent years, it had begun accepting pilots straight out of flight school. “The unit is strapped for resources,” Lobach’s roommate told the NTSB. “They have struggled with staffing issues in general.”\n\nSimilar problems exist throughout Army aviation; the service has been having a hard time retaining its most experienced pilots and providing adequate flight time for those currently coming up through the ranks. Since 2011, the average number of hours flown per year by crewed Army aircraft has fallen from 302 to 198.\n\nLobach continued to fret about the wind, while Eaves seemed unfazed.\n\nLobach: Strong headwind right now.\n\nLobach: Uh, pretty strong headwind.\n\nShe pointed out that even though the airspeed indicator had the helicopter moving at 110 knots, the GPS was showing their groundspeed as 93 knots, implying a headwind of 17 knots or 20 mph.\n\nAfter Lobach again commented on how choppy the conditions were, Eaves took control back, just a minute and 48 seconds after he had relinquished it. In the first hour of flying time, Lobach had been operating the controls for a total of three and a half minutes.\n\nPAT 25 was skirting the edge of the busy restricted airspace around Dulles and Reagan, a three-dimensional imaginary blob 90 miles across with corridors cut through at low altitudes for helicopter traffic. It’s a complicated and busy environment that encompasses three major airports and three military airbases and is patrolled by military helicopters from three different branches of the military. Some transport VIPs, others hunt and intercept drones and aircraft that shouldn’t be in this highly sensitive space.\n\nTo be clear, there was no need for PAT 25 to be messing around in this airspace. All Lobach needed to do on this flight was demonstrate her proficiency with night-vision goggles and her skill at operating the aircraft. They could have done everything in the much quieter region around Greenhouse Airport, and other flight instructors routinely did. “I would go kind of west and south, for the most part,” says Austin Roth, a former instructor pilot in the 12th Aviation Battalion who flew with Eaves and even once gave him a check ride. “That was my preference.”\n\nAs they passed over the Civil War battlefield of Thoroughfare Gap, an alarm called a master caution went off, indicating that a control system for a tail fin was malfunctioning. If the situation worsened and the surface became stuck, the helicopter could crash. Lobach immediately started to run an emergency checklist. To their relief, they were able to reset the system without difficulty.\n\nOnce everything was sorted out, Eaves took a moment to critique her performance.\n\nEaves: “So how’s that supposed to look, ma’am?”\n\nLobach: “That EP [emergency checklist]?\n\nLobach realized that in her haste to resolve the issue, she’d skipped a preliminary step: pulling out a document called the flight reference card (FRC) and reading the action steps from it directly, rather than relying on memory.\n\nEaves: Yup. So, I mean, that’s the whole point of the FRC cards, right, is to get us away from doing those things automatically … ’cause we end up killing ourselves because we do something without confirming and verifying …\n\nLobach: Okay, thank you, yeah, you’re absolutely right. I sometimes forget that.\n\nSoon after, Lobach complained of lightheadedness.\n\nLobach: I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling a little dizzy, like, looking down and around with the winds or whatever it is, but not too bad.\n\nEaves: Roger. It is definitely windy. But a beautiful night other than that.\n\nThey were now at their maximum distance to the north from their home airfield at Fort Davison. To get back, they could either return the way they came, flying south and then east, or go the other way around Dulles and Reagan by flying east and then south. Doing the latter would necessitate cutting through the busiest part of the whole Washington airspace, using the river routes that thread between Reagan National Airport and the National Mall.\n\nThat’s what Eaves chose to do. As they were turning east, Lobach decided that she was ready to fly the helicopter.\n\nLobach: Would you be up for me flying for a little while?\n\nEaves: Yup, by all means, ma’am.\n\nTheir next landing spot was a helipad located at the Federal Support Center, an underground facility located at a former Nike missile-launch site in Olney, Maryland. As they drew near, Eaves prepped Lobach for their arrival. As usual, they would fly to a pre-chosen waypoint, known as a release point (RP), then decelerate and descend to a touchdown in the landing zone. Now that the wind was at their back, it was pushing them to a higher groundspeed than their airspeed, meaning that they had less time to plan and react as they maneuvered for landing.\n\nEaves: All right, you’re 1.4 [kilometers] to your RP.\n\nLobach: Okay. Slow down, come down a bit. Wow, that’s wild! I’m slowing down and still at a hundred knots ground.\n\nEaves: 0.7 [kilometers]. What’s your RP?\n\nLobach: Um, I’m sorry — what do you mean, “What was it?”\n\nEaves: All right, what am I looking for on the ground?\n\nLobach: Um, I can’t remember, I have to look at my notes.\n\nEaves told her not to worry about her notes, which told her how to visually identify their landing spot, and instead to simply follow her navigational instruments, which had been programmed with the waypoint’s coordinates.\n\nAs they descended, Eaves and O’Hara called out items on the pre-landing checklist. Lobach commented that she could feel the strong, gusty wind pushing on the left side of the aircraft. Both she and Eaves were scanning ahead, looking for the helipad amid the trees and buildings below them. Eaves spotted it first, then Lobach. But as she maneuvered to come in for a landing to the north, she lost track of it.\n\nEaves: Remember, there is a fence on the north side of this pad.\n\nLobach: Yeah. Thank you … probably still coming in a little too fast. Not so bad. See that big tree on the right? Am I clear of that?\n\nSuddenly, the landing was not looking so good, and Eaves told her to abort.\n\nEaves: Go around! Go around! Go around!\n\nLobach added power and climbed away from the terrain. As she did, building airspeed, she put the helicopter into a banked turn.\n\nEaves: Are you going — which way are you going, ma’am?\n\nLobach: I was going to go right, sorry, do you want me to go left?\n\nEaves: I think it would probably be better, because you’re turning into the wind, right?\n\nThe idea of a go-around is to climb in order to come around and try landing again, but Lobach was starting to feel sketched out.\n\nLobach: I’m not sure I’m, I’m —\n\nLobach: This doesn’t feel right.\n\nEaves: Yup. You’re good. Feels like you’re getting your ass kicked with some wind to the left, right?\n\nEaves: So go ahead and start your approach.\n\nEaves coached her to add power and get the aircraft back in position to try landing again.\n\nLobach: Yeah, I — I’m not comfortable landing there.\n\nLobach: I’m clearing out. I probably could, but — it’s handling funny.\n\nEaves: All right. Mind if I give it a shot?\n\nEaves took the controls and landed the helicopter. On the ground, he talked her through how to handle the tricky winds and offered her a chance to try again.\n\nLobach: Yeah, honestly — I, uh, when we got to the … at that point, that’s probably, like, where I was like, Yeah, I don’t want to do this, ’cause I can’t really see it, like maybe I need to be higher in my chair or something, but I kind of lost any … Yeah, I’m good with the demonstration.\n\nEaves had no objections, and they decided to head back to base. By failing to complete the maneuver as requested, Lobach had effectively failed the check ride. Once back at their home base, Eaves would have to give her a rating of “unsatisfactory,” and Lobach would be put on training status until she was able to demonstrate the necessary proficiency.\n\nBut as they continued their mission, neither mentioned that fact.\n\nTheir course south took them across the wealthy Maryland suburbs of Bethesda and Cabin John, passing over golf courses, nature preserves, and tracts of expensive homes as they headed for the Potomac.\n\nFour minutes after takeoff, perhaps to show that she was not intimidated by the aircraft, Lobach again asked to take the controls. She would have them for the rest of the flight.\n\nPilots who are rusty or lack experience do not have the muscle memory that more skilled pilots possess. When too much information is flooding in at once, they are unable to process it all and become what psychologists call “task saturated.” Among aviators, the condition is known as being “behind the plane.” In this state pilots, are unable to plan ahead to anticipate problems. They respond reactively or simply miss cues altogether. They are not, in other words, fully in control of the aircraft.\n\nReaching the Potomac again at Cabin John, she was too high — 1,400 feet instead of the max altitude of 1,300 — and turned right instead of left, nearly putting the helicopter into forbidden airspace. Rather than taking control of the aircraft back from her, Eaves gently teased her. She pulled a 180, descending as she entered Route 1, a flight corridor along the Potomac’s northern shore.\n\nYou could think of these D.C. helicopter routes as tunnels through the otherwise forbidden airspace. They have a defined ceiling that gets lower and lower as you get closer to the center of the city but no defined lateral boundaries; instead, pilots are instructed to follow the bank of the river. That may seem a little vague, but pilots understand how to do it.\n\n“When I flew those routes, especially at night, I always flew them right on the bank,” says Tim Lilley, a former Army pilot who operated Black Hawks in the D.C. metro area. “One of the reasons is it’s very much easier to tell if you’re gaining or losing altitude, looking at trees and rocks and whatever is on the bank, as opposed to looking at water. If you’re looking at water, there’s no contrast, so you don’t know if you’re climbing or descending unless you look at your instruments. It’s a very bad idea to fly just flat over water at 200 feet, because you’re going to have to spend a lot of time looking inside to make sure you’re at the right altitude. You could very quickly lose 200 feet and end up in the drink.”\n\nAs she flew down the river, Lobach was clearly struggling to stay in control of the aircraft. Eaves nudged her to keep the helicopter in trim and to find the correct altitude.\n\nAt 8:43, as they passed one of the most sensitive and restricted airspaces in the world — the vice-president’s residence at the Naval Observatory — Lobach again complained about the turbulence.\n\nLobach: Getting choppy close to the ground.\n\nEaves: Oh yeah, down low it’s definitely gonna get choppy.\n\nLobach: Yeah. We’re at 300 [feet altitude].\n\nThat was not correct, as Eaves indirectly reminded her.\n\nLobach descended, but the ceiling of the corridor was decreasing as well, so she needed to come down further still.\n\nEaves: All right, there’s 300 for 200.\n\nBut she was not at 200 feet. As she passed the Lincoln Memorial, she was above 300 feet and, in fact, had begun climbing. She had also let the aircraft get out of trim, so that the helicopter was flying somewhat sideways to the wind. Novice pilots who are fixated on one of the numerous aspects of their flight — altitude, location, speed, communication with air-traffic control — can easily lose track of the trim. But it’s an important part of good airmanship, especially during turns.\n\nSouth of the Lincoln Memorial, the helicopter route bends east to cross the Tidal Basin and follows a side branch, the Washington Channel, which is occupied by a small marina. Staying on track required a sharp turn to the left.\n\nEaves: Lots of right pedal, ma’am.\n\nEaves: There we go, now we can make the turn.\n\nHe noticed that, in the process of getting the helicopter to fly straight, she had lost track of her altitude and gotten too high again.\n\nEaves: You’re at 300 feet. Come down for me.\n\nLobach stopped climbing and brought the helicopter into a sharp, short descent, but still remained above the route ceiling.\n\nAs PAT 25 was working its way southeast along Route 1, a regional jet inbound from Wichita was coming up the river from the south, heading for runway 33 at Reagan. Operated by a subsidiary of American Airlines, PSA Airlines flight 5342 was a Bombardier CRJ700 with four crewmembers and 60 passengers, including a group of teenage figure skaters, coaches, and parents returning from the national figure-skating championships.\n\nPAT 25’s path along the east bank of the Potomac would take it right under the designated flight path for jets landing on runway 33. Technically, if neither the helicopter nor the plane deviated from its assigned route, they would pass each other safely, but the margin was so small — just 75 feet at the point of closest approach — that the air-traffic controller at Reagan’s tower called PAT 25 to alert it.\n\nReagan Tower: PAT 25, traffic just south of Wilson Bridge is a CRJ at 1,200 feet for runway 33.\n\nThe primary job of an air-traffic controller is to keep aircraft from colliding. Given that two aircraft on the controller’s screen were now on a converging course, it was crucial to ensure that their paths did not intersect. A commonly used option was to hold southbound helicopter traffic at Hains Point, where the Washington Channel rejoins the main channel of the Potomac, until the landing plane had passed. Instead, Eaves assured the tower that he could see the incoming flight and asked for permission to stay clear of it under his own cognizance.\n\nEaves: PAT 25 has the traffic in sight. Request visual separation.\n\nReagan Tower: Separation approved.\n\nEaves did not have PSA 5342 in sight. As he looked to the south, the airliner would have appeared as one of a string of bright-white dots strung above the horizon. Some commentators have speculated that Eaves had another aircraft in sight, which he mistakenly believed to be PSA 5342. But it may have been that he didn’t have any aircraft in sight at all. During an interview with NTSB investigators, Army Chief Warrant Officer David Van Vechten testified that it was common practice for pilots in the 12th Aviation Battalion to say that they had the traffic in sight even when they didn’t, so that the tower would give them the visual separation clearance. “I’ve done that,” Van Vechten said. “I know if I don’t say it, I may have to hold.”\n\nAs they approached Hains Point, Eaves noted that the wind was pushing them, from behind and from the side, toward the eastern bank. To stay on course, Lobach would have to counteract that push by angling the helicopter to the right.\n\nLobach: Crabbing … better not to fight the wind. Right pedal.\n\nFifty seconds later, PAT 25 rejoined the main channel of the Potomac at Hains Point. The lights of Reagan Airport lay a half mile to the right. The PSA flight was a mile and a half away, dead ahead, on a converging course, and closing at a speed of more than 200 mph.\n\nIn the aftermath of the crash, investigators focused on the staffing level at the Reagan tower, concerned that an overburdened controller had mistakenly allowed the aircraft to converge, but the transcript shows that the close approach of the jet and the helicopter was front-of-mind for him. As the distance between the aircraft closed, he checked in with the Black Hawk.\n\nReagan Tower: PAT 25, you have the CRJ in sight? PAT 25 pass behind the CRJ.\n\nEaves: PAT 25 has aircraft in sight. Request visual separation.\n\nReagan Tower: Visual separation.\n\nFlying south from Hains Point, Lobach should have eased to the left to join the bank of the Potomac. Instead, she headed straight down the center of the river. Out here over the water, the river was just a black void. The only way to gauge how high she was was to look at the altimeter inside the cockpit. But that meant not looking outside at what was in front of her.\n\nLikely, she was still task saturated: trying to keep the helicopter at the right altitude, and along the right path, while wrestling with turbulence and a gusty wind that was pushing her toward the river bank on her left, all while wearing night-vision goggles that blocked her peripheral vision and overwhelmed her eyes with too much light. In this environment, with all the lights of the city around her, it would actually have been much easier to see with the goggles off, but that would have defeated the purpose of the mission.\n\nIn a word, Lobach was flailing. Eaves was as well, too distracted by his runaway student pilot to pay attention to what was happening outside the cockpit.\n\nEaves: All right, kinda come left for me, ma’am. I think that’s why he’s asking.\n\nLobach did not turn toward the eastern bank.\n\nAt 8:47:57.7, the helicopter’s black box recorded Lobach making a “sound similar to mumbling.”\n\nThe Blackhawk helicopter was flying at an altitude of 278 feet and a speed of 120 mph. It was both too far out from the riverbank and too high, which put it squarely in the path of the CRJ descending at 128 mph.\n\nOne second before impact, the CRJ’s flight crew tried to pull the airplane up. The helicopter’s main rotor hit the nose and engines of the airliner, triggering a fireball, and the commingled wreckage fell vertically into the Potomac River. The impact would have been unsurvivable for anyone onboard.\n\nWhat Lobach faced on the final night of her life was a mission that was far beyond her skill level. She was a low-proficiency pilot with a low aptitude for flying, one who didn’t fly regularly in an operational role and had no intention of flying after leaving the service. She was operating a helicopter that was older, less automated, and more challenging than what she’d trained on. Her instructor pilot had been warned to keep a tight rein on her during the flight but had failed to do so.\n\nAs the pilot in command, Eaves bears personal responsibility for what happened. But responsibility was not his alone. The crash was also a product of a dysfunctional system. For years, the Army air-accident rate has been climbing, as aviators complain that they are not being given enough flight time to maintain adequate levels of skill.\n\n“Across a lot of Army aviation units … what we’re seeing is that composite cockpit time is steadily going down and down and down,” said NTSB Chairman Jennifer Homendy during a hearing into the accident. “Five years ago, we would have thousands of hours cockpit. Now, we have hundreds and hundreds of hours cockpit … Experience across aviation formations is steadily decreasing.”\n\nIt’s striking that this decrease is even being felt at the 12th Aviation Battalion, whose mission is to transport the legislators who make Defense spending decisions and the Pentagon brass who implement those decisions. You’d think that they’d want their lives entrusted to only the most skilled pilots. The fate of PAT 25 shows that the unit can’t even be trusted to transport itself. “At her flight time of 460-something hours, if you’re not flying once a week, you are not proficient,” says Tim Lilley, the former Army Black Hawk pilot. “Certainly not proficient enough to fly high-ranking officials.” Yet the Army considered Lobach qualified to do just that.\n\nAfter Lilley retired from the military, he became an airline pilot, and eventually his son Samuel became an airline pilot, too. Samuel Lilley was serving as the first officer of PSA 5342 on the night of January 29, 2025. In the year since his death Tim has been on a mission to change the Army’s approach so that tragedies like this don’t happen again.\n\n“It was an embarrassment to Army aviation,” he says. “And you know, I still proudly wear my Army wings. But there’s a lot of things that have to be addressed.”\n\nOne thing he’d like to see happen is for the Army to establish a rigorous safety-reporting system of the kind that’s standard in commercial aviation. Another is to make sure that pilots get enough flying time to be proficient, even if that means taking staff officers off the roster entirely. “They have 14,000 active pilots. And I said to the Army Chief of Staff, ‘Wouldn’t you rather have 11,000 proficient pilots, rather than 14,000 pilots that are barely getting minimums?’”\n\nHe knows that it will be a hard journey to get there. Cultures don’t change easily. But a son’s death is a powerful motivator. As for Eaves and Lobach, he doesn’t blame them for his son’s death. He thinks that Lobach could have become a good pilot if they gave her another thousand hours of flying time. Instead, the Army withheld from her the training and flight time that she needed to fly safely and then required her to go fly anyway on a mission that was as ill-conceived as it was poorly executed.\n\n“There was no reason for them to be there,” he says. “This was a bad idea. A bad plan from the get-go.”",

    "description": "how we used math, reinforcement learning, and social engineering to build a universal rhythm game cheat, climb to top 20 worldwide, and get banned without ever being detected.",
    "fullText": "using math and reinforcement learning, we built a cheat that works on literally every VSRG - osu!mania, etterna, quaver, stepmania, you name it. no game-specific code. just math and a trained model that learned to read scrolling notes and output perfectly timed keystrokes.\n\nit worked too well. top 20 worldwide on osu!, then banned. even funnier than that, they still had no proof the scores were cheated, and could only ban us for multi-accounting suspicions.\n\nthe best part? we social-engineered our way into the community so hard that top 100 players were vouching for us being legit. people analyzed our replays and said “yeah this looks human.” whilst we never even pressed a single key.\n\nthis is the story of how we spent a weekend building something we probably shouldn’t have, got way better results than we expected, and confirmed that the hardest part of cheating isn’t fooling the software, it’s fooling the people.\n\nit started as a joke. “what if we made a bot that could play osu!mania?” turned into “what if it worked on every rhythm game?” which turned into “what if we actually tried to rank?” which turned into high ranked accounts in every rhythm game, a top 20 global ranking, friendships with players who had no idea they were befriending a python script, and eventually a ban that proved we’d done our job almost too well.\n\nwe’re not releasing the code. we’re not here to help you cheat. we’re here because these were really interesting technical and sociological problems we’ve worked on, and the intersection of math, machine learning, reverse engineering, and straight-up social engineering is too good not to document.\n\nalso, statute of limitations on internet drama is like 6 months… right?\n\nVSRG stands for Vertical Scrolling Rhythm Game. if you’ve ever played guitar hero, dance dance revolution, or beatmania, then you’ve played a VSRG. notes fall from the top of the screen, you press the corresponding key when they hit the bottom. simple.\n\nthe competitive scene is… not simple.\n\ngames like osu!mania, etterna, quaver, and stepmania have global leaderboards, ranked play, and communities that take timing accuracy and legitimacy very seriously. we’re talking millisecond-level precision. the difference between a “marvelous” and a “perfect” hit can be 16ms. the difference between top 100 and top 1000 is consistency across thousands of notes.\n\nhere’s the thing that made this project possible: every VSRG is fundamentally the same problem.\n\nnotes scroll down. you press keys. the visual style changes. between games, it can be stylized as arrows, circles, bars, whatever… but the underlying mechanic is identical! timing windows vary, scoring formulas differ, but the core loop is:\n\nwhich means if you can solve this problem once, mathematically, you can solve it for every game in the genre.\n\nthis seems like an easy problem to solve.. right? well, not exactly.\n\n“just OCR the screen and press keys lol”\n\ntechnically, this fails for a few reasons:\n\nwe tried this first. it was bad. like, worse than average bad.\n\nbut here’s the thing most people don’t realize: even if your bot plays perfectly, you still lose.\n\nosu! has actual anti-cheat software, sure. (albeit old, you can still see some of vmfunc and pushfq’s research on their ac here) but the real threat isn’t their anti-cheat really, it’s the community.\n\never heard of r/osureport? it’s a subreddit dedicated entirely to hunting cheaters. thousands of players spending their free time analyzing replays, tracking improvement curves, comparing timing distributions, and writing detailed reports on anyone who looks suspicious.\n\nthey have spreadsheets. they have bots that automate report tracking. they categorize cheats by type: relax hacks, timewarp, macros, aim assist, multi-account, and whatnot. they track ban statuses. it’s genuinely impressive how organized they are at ruining cheaters’ days.\n\nand it’s not just reddit. set a good or a top score on a ranked map and you’ll have people in your DMs within hours. “hey nice score, can you stream it?” “your UR is crazy consistent, what’s your setup?” “I noticed your improvement curve is insane, how long have you been playing?”\n\nevery replay is public. every score can be downloaded and frame-by-frame analyzed. people will literally overlay your cursor movements on top of known cheaters to look for patterns. they’ll run statistical analysis on your hit timing distributions. they’ll compare your offline vs online performance.\n\nthe osu! community has mass-reported accounts into bans purely based on “this doesn’t feel right.” no concrete proof, just collective suspicion. and staff often listens.\n\nso the real challenge isn’t just “play the notes correctly.” it’s:\n\nthis is why most cheats get caught. not because the software detected them but because a bored 16 year old with too much free time noticed something was off. or because you beat the score of another top player who took the piss.\n\nso how do we even achieve this?\n\nthe notes are deterministic. the chart is the chart. if you know the scroll speed and the current timestamp, you can mathematically derive where every note will be at any moment.\n\nthis is just calculus. and a little signal processing.\n\nbut wait… remember the human problem? pure math gives you perfect inputs. perfect inputs get you banned in 24 hours.\n\nhere’s where it gets interesting. osu! lets you download replays. any replay. from anyone. including the top 50 players in the world.\n\nso we did exactly that. we scraped thousands of replays from top 100 players across different skill brackets. not just their best plays, their mediocre ones too. the ones where they choked. the ones where they were warming up. the ones at 3am when they were using different setups and keyboards.\n\nfrom each replay, we extracted:\n\nturns out humans are incredibly consistent in their inconsistency. top players don’t just have better accuracy but they actually have signature error patterns. you shouldn’t interpret their timing distributions as random noise, they’re actually shaped by muscle memory, fatigue, and playstyle.\n\nso in theory, if you can mimick that, while also mimicking a natural pattern of improving after playing a chart over and over again, or choking every now and then, you’re basically just a human to the external eye.\n\nwe now had a dataset of what “legitimate top player” actually looks like, statistically. the goal wasn’t to play perfectly but it was to play exactly like a human would if that human had god-tier reflexes.\n\nalright, let’s get into the actual implementation.\n\nwe sample single pixels at the hit zone for each column. for a 4-key layout, that’s 4 regions:\n\neach frame, we capture these 1x1 pixel regions and check if a note is present via color matching:\n\nsimple color thresholding with a tolerance of ~3. works surprisingly well across different skins as long as you calibrate the target colors.\n\nhere’s where it gets interesting. we track KPS (keys per second) in real-time and use it to dynamically adjust timing variance:\n\nhumans get less consistent when playing faster. so we scale deviance with KPS:\n\nat low KPS (slow sections), timing is tight and consistent. at high KPS (dense streams), variance increases. this matches how real players behave, obviously you can’t maintain perfect consistency at 20+ KPS.\n\nlong notes get different treatment though, smaller deviance on press/release because humans are actually more consistent with holds:\n\npure math gets you accuracy. but leaderboards also care about:\n\nuniform random distribution doesn’t look human. humans have biased error distributions, they tend to hit slightly early or slightly late depending on playstyle, and errors cluster in patterns.\n\nwe had thousands of replays. we had a working bot. now we needed to make them talk to each other.\n\nwe framed this as a policy optimization problem. the agent’s job, given a note timing, had to output a delay that maximizes “human-likeness” while staying within scoring windows.\n\nthe perfection_penalty was crucial. without it, the agent learned to hit perfect timings every time, which is exactly what gets you reported.\n\nfor each replay in our dataset, we extracted:\n\nthis gave us ~2 million training samples across different skill levels, playstyles, and song difficulties.\n\nmodel wise it’s nothing fancy, a small feedforward network (3 hidden layers, 128 units each) that outputs mean and variance for a gaussian distribution. we sample from that distribution to get the actual delay.\n\ntrained with PPO for ~500k steps. the loss curves were boring (good sign) and the final policy produced timing distributions that were statistically indistinguishable from our reference players.\n\nwe generated 1000 synthetic replays and compared their timing distributions against real replays using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. p-values > 0.05 for all columns and KPS brackets.\n\nin english (for the non math nerds out there) if you looked at a histogram of our bot’s timing errors vs a real player’s timing errors, you couldn’t tell them apart.\n\nhere’s what it looks like in action:\n\ngame 1 uses arrow skins. game 2 uses circles. game 3 uses bars. game 4 uses rectangles. who cares?\n\nthe core engine doesn’t change. the humanizer doesn’t change. the only thing that changes per-game is:\n\nwe built a simple config system. point it at a new game, calibrate the detection regions, tweak the timing parameters, done. same bot, different skin.\n\ntested on: osu!mania, etterna, quaver, stepmania, malody, even roblox, and a few others we probably shouldn’t name. worked on all of them.\n\nwith a working bot and a humanizer that passed statistical tests, it was time to see how far we could push it.\n\nwe spent around ~5000 dollars on accounts on various games, osu!, etterna, quaver, roblox, you name it.\n\nthe last one was the hardest. we couldn’t just jump from unranked to top 100 in a week. so we tried two different routes.\n\nthe first one, scripting a fake improvement curve start with easier maps, gradually increase difficulty, occasionally plateau, sometimes regress slightly. just like a real player learning the game.\n\nthe second one, directly jumping to insane ranks and using our profiles in other games to prove our legitimacy and claim that we came from other games, since skills are transferrable.\n\nwe even made the bot “practice” maps. play the same song multiple times with slightly improving scores each time. leave realistic gaps between sessions. take breaks on weekends.\n\nfirst it was top 10,000. then top 5,000. then top 1,000. every milestone felt surreal. we were watching a program outperform thousands of real humans who had spent years developing their skills.\n\nat this point on some games like roblox, people started noticing. “what’s your practice routine” “can you stream sometime”\n\nwe couldn’t stream, obviously. so we made excuses. bad internet. anxiety. broken webcam. the community bought it. they had no reason not to.\n\nwe were in the leaderboards next to players we’d watched for years. players whose replays we’d scraped to train our bot were now competing against that same bot. the irony wasn’t lost on us lol\n\ntop 100 players vouched for us. people analyzed our replays frame-by-frame and said “yeah i mean this looks legit”. at some point on quaver someone even invited us to a tournament. we politely declined (scheduling conflicts, yk…)\n\nwe were living a double life. and honestly? it was kind of exhausting.\n\nhere’s the thing: we didn’t really get caught. not in the way you’d expect.\n\nout of all the accounts across all the games, only two osu! accounts got banned. the rest? still standing. etterna, quaver, the roblox games? all still up. we’ll be manually deleting them now that this post is out, since that was always the plan once the experiment was over.\n\nso what happened with those two osu! accounts?\n\nwe got cocky. we started sniping top players. taking their #1s on maps they cared about. that’s when people started paying attention.\n\nthe thing is, we had a cover story ready: “i’m coming from etterna/quaver, just switched to osu!mania.” this is actually a legitimate thing that happens, as players migrate between VSRGs all the time, and their skills transfer. it’s not suspicious to be good at osu!mania if you’ve been grinding etterna for years.\n\nwe even got top players to vouch for us. showed them our replays, chatted with them about technique, talked about our “background” in other games. claimed we were specifically good at X or Y playstyle, some analyzed our scores and said “yeah this tracks, the skillset transfers”… social engineering at its finest.\n\nsince both of us actually knew how to play VSRGs, we could handle conversations with top players just fine without struggling to use terminology or knowing things only good players would know.\n\nand here’s our strongest argument: we couldn’t possibly be cheating in EVERY game.\n\nthe community’s logic was simple, there are no publicly available cheats that work across osu!, etterna, quaver, AND roblox rhythm games. surely if someone was cheating, they’d only be cheating in one game? the idea of a universal VSRG cheat seemed absurd. “there’s no way someone has a cheat for all of them”\n\nturns out we did. but nobody believed that was even possible.\n\nthe irony of this screenshot still kills us. “i just so happen to have a cheat that works on every game including quaver etterna osu roblox” said sarcastically, as if that’s an absurd claim. reader, it was not absurd. we had exactly that.\n\nbut here’s the thing about sniping top players: they get salty. and salty players report. a lot.\n\nthe anti-cheat never flagged us. our replays passed every statistical test the community threw at them. the timing distributions looked human. the persona was solid.\n\nwhat got us was the cockiness which led to a report. not with evidence (as all evidence they provided got disproven by other top players, including graphs!), just “this doesn’t feel right” from enough people that staff had to do something.\n\nthe official ban reason? multi-accounting and stolen account suspicion. not cheating. they couldn’t prove cheating because, statistically, there was nothing to prove. our replays were indistinguishable from human replays.\n\nthey knew something was off. too good, too fast, too many people complaining. but they couldn’t prove what.\n\nin the end, the cheat was never detected. the human behind it was just too annoying.\n\nand honestly? that felt like a win.\n\nrhythm games are a solved problem - mathematically, there’s nothing stopping a bot from achieving perfect play. the timing is deterministic, the inputs are simple.\n\nthe hard part is the human problem - anti-cheat software is easy to bypass. the community is not. thousands of players actively hunting for cheaters is a more effective deterrent than any automated system.\n\nstatistical humanization is surprisingly effective - with enough training data and the right model, you can generate behavior that’s indistinguishable from human behavior. scary implications beyond rhythm games.\n\nsocial engineering is underrated - half our success came from building a believable persona in various games. the technical cheat was good, but the social cover was what let us climb for months.\n\nwe spent way too much time on this - could’ve learned a real skill. instead we learned how to fake one. worth it? probably not. fun? absolutely.\n\nwe’re not releasing code and we’re not here to help people cheat.\n\nthis is documentation of an interesting technical problem! the intersection of signal processing, reinforcement learning, game hacking, and social engineering.\n\nthe rhythm game community will probably hate this post. fair honestly. and we’re sorry. but the problems we solved here have applications beyond cheating at video games: fraud detection, bot detection, behavioral biometrics, and much more! understanding how to fake human behavior helps you understand how to detect fake human behavior.\n\nalso we’re already banned and are going to delete all our other accounts used for testing. what are they gonna do, ban us again?\n\nwe built something that shouldn’t work as well as it did. we climbed higher than we expected. we made friends who weren’t real and rivals who didn’t know they were competing against code.\n\nin the end, we got caught not because the cheat failed, but because humans are better at detecting humans than software ever will be. the bot was perfect. the person it was pretending to be wasn’t convincing enough.\n\nthere’s probably a lesson in there somewhere.\n\nthanks for reading. don’t cheat at video games. it’s not worth it.\n\nbut if you’re going to do it anyway, at least do your own research, write your own stuff, and make it interesting",

    "description": "IPIDEA’s proxy infrastructure is a component of the digital ecosystem leveraged by a wide array of bad actors.",
    "fullText": "Visibility and context on the threats that matter most.\n\nThis week Google and partners took action to disrupt what we believe is one of the largest residential proxy networks in the world, the IPIDEA proxy network. IPIDEA’s proxy infrastructure is a little-known component of the digital ecosystem leveraged by a wide array of bad actors.\n\nThis disruption, led by Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) in partnership with other teams, included three main actions:\n\nTook legal action to take down domains used to control devices and proxy traffic through them.\n\nShared technical intelligence on discovered IPIDEA software development kits (SDKs) and proxy software with platform providers, law enforcement, and research firms to help drive ecosystem-wide awareness and enforcement. These SDKs, which are offered to developers across multiple mobile and desktop platforms, surreptitiously enroll user devices into the IPIDEA network. Driving collective enforcement against these SDKs helps protect users across the digital ecosystem and restricts the network's ability to expand.\n\nThese efforts to help keep the broader digital ecosystem safe supplement the protections we have to safeguard Android users on certified devices. We ensured Google Play Protect, Android’s built-in security protection, automatically warns users and removes applications known to incorporate IPIDEA SDKs, and blocks any future install attempts.\n\nWe believe our actions have caused significant degradation of IPIDEA’s proxy network and business operations, reducing the available pool of devices for the proxy operators by millions. Because proxy operators share pools of devices using reseller agreements, we believe these actions may have downstream impact across affiliated entities.\n\nIn contrast to other types of proxies, residential proxy networks sell the ability to route traffic through IP addresses owned by internet service providers (ISPs) and used to provide service to residential or small business customers. By routing traffic through an array of consumer devices all over the world, attackers can mask their malicious activity by hijacking these IP addresses. This generates significant challenges for network defenders to detect and block malicious activities.\n\nA robust residential proxy network requires the control of millions of residential IP addresses to sell to customers for use. IP addresses in countries such as the US, Canada, and Europe are considered especially desirable. To do this, residential proxy network operators need code running on consumer devices to enroll them into the network as exit nodes. These devices are either pre-loaded with proxy software or are joined to the proxy network when users unknowingly download trojanized applications with embedded proxy code. Some users may knowingly install this software on their devices, lured by the promise of “monetizing” their spare bandwidth. When the device is joined to the proxy network, the proxy provider sells access to the infected device’s network bandwidth (and use of its IP address) to their customers.\n\nWhile operators of residential proxies often extol the privacy and freedom of expression benefits of residential proxies, Google Threat Intelligence Group’s (GTIG) research shows that these proxies are overwhelmingly misused by bad actors. IPIDEA has become notorious for its role in facilitating several botnets: its software development kits played a key role in adding devices to the botnets, and its proxy software was then used by bad actors to control them. This includes the BadBox2.0 botnet we took legal action against last year, and the Aisuru and Kimwolf botnets more recently. We also observe IPIDEA being leveraged by a vast array of espionage, crime, and information operations threat actors. In a single seven day period in January 2026, GTIG observed over 550 individual threat groups that we track utilizing IP addresses tracked as IPIDEA exit nodes to obfuscate their activities, including groups from China, DPRK, Iran and Russia. The activities included access to victim SaaS environments, on-premises infrastructure, and password spray attacks. Our research has found significant overlaps between residential proxy network exit nodes, likely because of reseller and partnership agreements, making definitive quantification and attribution challenging.\n\nIn addition, residential proxies pose a risk to the consumers whose devices are joined to the proxy network as exit nodes. These users knowingly or unknowingly provide their IP address and device as a launchpad for hacking and other unauthorized activities, potentially causing them to be flagged as suspicious or blocked by providers. Proxy applications also introduce security vulnerabilities to consumers’ devices and home networks. When a user’s device becomes an exit node, network traffic that they do not control will pass through their device. This means bad actors can access a user’s private devices on the same network, effectively exposing security vulnerabilities to the internet. GTIG’s analysis of these applications confirmed that IPIDEA proxy did not solely route traffic through the exit node device, they also sent traffic to the device, in order to compromise it. While proxy providers may claim ignorance or close these security gaps when notified, enforcement and verification is challenging given intentionally murky ownership structures, reseller agreements, and diversity of applications.\n\nOur analysis of residential proxy networks found that many well-known residential proxy brands are not only related but are controlled by the actors behind IPIDEA. This includes the following ostensibly independent proxy and VPN brands:\n\nCherry Proxy (cherryproxy\\.com)\n\nThe same actors that control these brands also control several domains related to Software Development Kits (SDKs) for residential proxies. These SDKs are not meant to be installed or executed as standalone applications, rather they are meant to be embedded into existing applications. The operators market these kits as ways for developers to monetize their applications, and offer Android, Windows, iOS, and WebOS compatibility. Once developers incorporate these SDKs into their app, they are then paid by IPIDEA usually on a per-download basis.\n\nFigure 1: Advertising from PacketSDK, part of the IPIDEA proxy network\n\nOnce the SDK is embedded into an application, it will turn the device it is running on into an exit node for the proxy network in addition to providing whatever the primary functionality of the application was. These SDKs are the key to any residential proxy network—the software they get embedded into provides the network operators with the millions of devices they need to maintain a healthy residential proxy network.\n\nWhile many residential proxy providers state that they source their IP addresses ethically, our analysis shows these claims are often incorrect or overstated. Many of the malicious applications we analyzed in our investigation did not disclose that they enrolled devices into the IPIDEA proxy network. Researchers have previously found uncertified and off-brand Android Open Source Project devices, such as television set top boxes, with hidden residential proxy payloads.\n\nThe following SDKs are controlled by the same actors that control the IPIDEA proxy network:\n\nWe performed static and dynamic analysis on software that had SDK code embedded in it as well as standalone SDK files to identify the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure used to manage proxy exit nodes and route traffic through them. From the analysis we observed that EarnSDK, PacketSDK, CastarSDK, and HexSDK have significant overlaps in their C2 infrastructure as well as code structure.\n\nThe infrastructure model is a two-tier system:\n\nTier One: Upon startup, the device will choose from a set of domains to connect to. The device sends some diagnostic information to the Tier One server and receives back a data payload that includes a set of Tier Two nodes to connect to.\n\nTier Two: The application will communicate directly with an IP address to periodically poll for proxy tasks. When it receives a proxy task it will establish a new dedicated connection to the Tier Two IP address and begin proxying the payloads it receives.\n\nThe device diagnostic information can be sent as HTTP GET query string parameters or in the HTTP POST body, depending on the domain and SDK. The payload sent includes a key parameter, which may be a customer identifier used to determine who gets paid for the device enrollment.\n\nFigure 3: Sample device information send to Tier One server\n\nThe response from the Tier One server includes some timing information as well as the IP addresses of the Tier Two servers that this device should periodically poll for tasking.\n\nFigure 4: Sample response received from the Tier One Server\n\nThe Tier Two servers are sent as connect and proxy pairs. In all analyses the pairs have been IP addresses, not domains. In our analysis, the pairs are the same IP address but different ports. The connect port is used to periodically poll for new proxy tasking. This is performed by sending TCP packets with encoded JSON payloads.\n\nFigure 5: Sample encoded JSON sent to Tier Two connect port\n\nWhen the Tier Two server has traffic to route to the device, it will respond back with the FQDN to proxy traffic to as well as a connection ID.\n\nFigure 6: Sample proxy tasking from the Tier Two server\n\nThe device will then establish a connection to the proxy port of the same Tier Two server and send the connection ID, indicating that it is ready to receive data payloads.\n\nFigure 7: Sample data sent from device to the Tier Two proxy port\n\nThe Tier Two server will then immediately send data payloads to be proxied. The device will extract the TCP data payload, establish a socket connection to the specified FQDN and send the payload, unmodified, to the destination.\n\nThe SDKs each have their own set of Tier One domains. This comes primarily from analysis of standalone SDK files.\n\nhttp://{random}.api-seed.packetsdk\\.xyz\n\nhttp://{random}.api-seed.packetsdk\\.net\n\nhttp://{random}.api-seed.packetsdk\\.io\n\ncfe47df26c8eaf0a7c136b50c703e173\\.com\n\n8b21a945159f23b740c836eb50953818\\.com\n\n31d58c226fc5a0aa976e13ca9ecebcc8\\.com\n\nDownload requests to files from the Hex SDK website redirect to castarsdk\\.com. The SDKs are exactly the same.\n\nThe EarnSDK JAR package for Android has strong overlaps with the other SDK brands analyzed. Earlier published samples contained the Tier One C2 domains:\n\nOf note, these domains were observed as part of the BadBox2.0 botnet and were sinkholed in our earlier litigation. Pivoting off these domains and other signatures, we identified some additional domains used as Tier One C2 domains:\n\nOur analysis of various malware samples and the SDKs found a single shared pool of Tier Two servers. As of this writing there were approximately 7,400 Tier Two servers. The number of Tier Two nodes changes on a daily basis, consistent with a demand-based scaling system. They are hosted in locations around the globe, including the US. This indicates that despite different brand names and Tier One domains, the different SDKs in fact manage devices and proxy traffic through the same infrastructure.\n\nThe IPIDEA actors also control domains that offer free Virtual Private Network services. While the applications do seem to provide VPN functionality, they also join the device to the IPIDEA proxy network as an exit node by incorporating Hex or Packet SDK. This is done without clear disclosures to the end user, nor is it the primary function of the application.\n\nWe identified a total of 3,075 unique Windows PE file hashes where dynamic analysis recorded a DNS request to at least one Tier One domain. A number of these hashes were for the monetized proxy exit node software, PacketShare. Our analysis also uncovered applications masquerading as OneDriveSync and Windows Update. These trojanized Windows applications were not distributed directly by the IPIDEA actors.\n\nWe identified over 600 applications across multiple download sources with code connecting to Tier One C2 domains. These apps were largely benign in function (e.g., utilities, games, and content) but utilized monetization SDKs that enabled IPIDEA proxy behavior.\n\nThis week we took a number of steps designed to comprehensively dismantle as much of IPIDEA’s infrastructure as possible.\n\nWe took legal action to take down the C2 domains used by bad actors to control devices and proxy traffic. This protects consumer devices and home networks by disrupting the infrastructure at the source.\n\nTo safeguard the Android ecosystem, we enforced our platform policies against trojanizing software, ensuring Google Play Protect on certified Android devices with Google Play services automatically warns users and removes applications known to incorporate IPIDEA software development kits (SDKs), and blocks any future install attempts.\n\nWe took legal action to take down the domains used to market IPIDEA’s products, including proxy software and software development kits, across their various brands.\n\nWe’ve shared our findings with industry partners to enable them to take action as well. We’ve worked closely with other firms, including Spur and Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs to understand the scope and extent of residential proxy networks and the bad behavior they often enable. We partnered with Cloudflare to disrupt IPIDEA’s domain resolution, impacting their ability to command and control infected devices and market their products.\n\nWhile we believe our actions have seriously impacted one of the largest residential proxy providers, this industry appears to be rapidly expanding, and there are significant overlaps across providers. As our investigation shows, the residential proxy market has become a \"gray market\" that thrives on deception—hijacking consumer bandwidth to provide cover for global espionage and cybercrime. More must be done to address the risks of these technologies.\n\nResidential proxies are an understudied area of risk for consumers, and more can be done to raise awareness. Consumers should be extremely wary of applications that offer payment in exchange for \"unused bandwidth\" or \"sharing your internet.\" These applications are primary ways for illicit proxy networks to grow, and could open security vulnerabilities on the device’s home network. We urge users to stick to official app stores, review permissions for third-party VPNs and proxies, and ensure built-in security protections like Google Play Protect are active.\n\nConsumers should be careful when purchasing connected devices, such as set top boxes, to make sure they are from reputable manufacturers. For example, to help you confirm whether or not a device is built with the official Android TV OS and Play Protect certified, our Android TV website provides the most up-to-date list of partners. You can also take these steps to check if your Android device is Play Protect certified.\n\nResidential proxy providers have been able to flourish under the guise of legitimate businesses. While some providers may indeed behave ethically and only enroll devices with the clear consent of consumers, any claims of \"ethical sourcing\" must be backed by transparent, auditable proof of user consent. Similarly, app developers have a responsibility to vet the monetization SDKs they integrate.\n\nWe encourage mobile platforms, ISPs, and other tech platforms to continue sharing intelligence and implementing best practices to identify illicit proxy networks and limit their harms.\n\nTo assist the wider community in hunting and identifying activity outlined in this blog post, we have included a comprehensive list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) in a GTI Collection for registered users.\n\n00857cca77b615c369f48ead5f8eb7f3.com\n\n31d58c226fc5a0aa976e13ca9ecebcc8.com\n\n3k7m1n9p4q2r6s8t0v5w2x4y6z8u9.com\n\n7x2k9n4p1q0r5s8t3v6w0y2z4u7b9.com\n\n8b21a945159f23b740c836eb50953818.com\n\na8d3b9e1f5c7024d6e0b7a2c9f1d83e5.com\n\naf4760df2c08896a9638e26e7dd20aae.com\n\nb5e9a2d7f4c8e3b1a0d6f2e9c5b8a7d.com\n\ncfe47df26c8eaf0a7c136b50c703e173.com\n\ne4f8c1b9a2d7e3f6c0b5a8d9e2f1c4d.com\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=69878507/C=HK/L=Hong Kong Island/O=HONGKONG LINGYUN MDT INFOTECH LIMITED/CN=HONGKONG LINGYUN MDT INFOTECH LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/businessCategory=Private Organization/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/serialNumber=2746134/C=HK/L=Wan Chai/O=HONGKONG LINGYUN MDT INFOTECH LIMITED/CN=HONGKONG LINGYUN MDT INFOTECH LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=74092936/C=HK/L=HONG KONG ISLAND/O=FIRENET LIMITED/CN=FIRENET LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=3157599/C=HK/L=Wan Chai/O=FIRENET LIMITED/CN=FIRENET LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=74097562/C=HK/L=Hong Kong Island/O=PRINCE LEGEND LIMITED/CN=PRINCE LEGEND LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=73874246/C=HK/L=Kowloon/O=MARS BROTHERS LIMITED/CN=MARS BROTHERS LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=3135905/C=HK/L=Cheung Sha Wan/O=MARS BROTHERS LIMITED/CN=MARS BROTHERS LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=3222394/C=HK/L=WAN CHAI/O=DATALABS LIMITED/CN=DATALABS LIMITED\n\nPacket SDK package found inside other applications\n\naef34f14456358db91840c416e55acc7d10185ff2beb362ea24697d7cdad321f\n\nApplication with Packet SDK Code\n\nb0726bdd53083968870d0b147b72dad422d6d04f27cd52a7891d038ee83aef5b\n\n2d1891b6d0c158ad7280f0f30f3c9d913960a793c6abcda249f9c76e13014e45\n\n59cbdecfc01eba859d12fbeb48f96fe3fe841ac1aafa6bd38eff92f0dcfd4554\n\nba9b1f4cc2c7f4aeda7a1280bbc901671f4ec3edaa17f1db676e17651e9bff5f\n\n01ac6012d4316b68bb3165ee451f2fcc494e4e37011a73b8cf2680de3364fcf4",

    "description": "Amid growing affordability concerns across the nation, President Trump said he is looking to drive housing prices further up, not down.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON − Amid growing affordability concerns across the nation, President Donald Trump said he is looking to drive housing prices further up, not down.\n\nTrump said at a Jan. 29 Cabinet meeting he wants to make it easier for Americans to buy homes ‒ but not by making housing less expensive. Instead, he suggested lower interest rates he expects from his upcoming pick to lead the Federal Reserve will allow more Americans to buy homes even as housing prices rise.\n\n\"I don't want to drive housing prices down. I want to drive housing prices up for people that own their homes,\" Trump said. \"And they can be assured that's what's going to happen.\"\n\nTrump has been rolling out several policy proposals and actions aimed at addressing affordability and housing as Americans continue to express cost-of-living concerns. That includes a Jan. 20 executive order banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes in a push to expand home ownership. The Trump administration is also purchasing mortgage-backed securities to lower mortgage rates.\n\nYet Trump made clear in his meeting with Cabinet secretaries that greater opportunities to buy homes shouldn't mean lowering costs, even as Americans voice concerns about the price tag to buy a home.\n\n\"Existing housing, people that own their homes, we're going to keep them wealthy,\" Trump said. \"We're going to keep those prices up. We're not going to destroy the value of their homes so that somebody who didn't work very hard can buy a home.\n\n\"We're going to make it easier to buy,\" the president added. \"We're going to get interest rates down. But I want to protect the people who, for the first time in their lives, feel good about themselves. They feel like, you know, that they're wealthy people.\"\n\nHousing prices rose in November 0.6% over the previous month, according to the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency's most recent monthly report, released Jan. 27. The median home price nationally soared to a record $433,000 in November 2025, according to the real estate company Redfin. Zillow projects housing prices to increase by 1.9% in 2026.\n\nHousing prices remain elevated relative to income growth after adjusting for inflation, pushing homeownership out of reach for many Americans. The housing market is considered stagnant amid a national housing shortage, especially at the lower end of the market.\n\nTrump last week said he opposes a plan endorsed by his White House economic team that would allow Americans to use retirement savings from their 401(k) accounts to make down payments on homes.\n\nTrump told his Cabinet he intends to announce his nominee as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve next week. For the past year, Trump has criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for refusing to aggressively lower interest rates as Trump has demanded. Powell's term as Fed chairman ends in May.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.",

They have their own memory management strategy, their own index logic, and a lot of edge-case scenarios.\n\nAs it goes with boringSQL deep-dives, this article will explore the corners of array functionality that might break your production.\n\nWait? Are we going to talk about JSONB arrays? Not at all. The whole concept of arrays in RDBMSs is actually document storage in disguise.\n\nIn database design, locality ensures faster retrieval times by keeping related data close on physical storage.Whether you use a distinct integer[] type or a JSON list [1, 2, 3], you are making the exact same architectural decision: you are prioritising locality over normalisation.\n\nWhen you store tag_ids in an array, you are embedding related data directly into a row - just like a NoSQL database might embed subdocuments. This is not inherently wrong. Document databases exist for good reasons: they eliminate joins, simplify reads, and map naturally to application objects.\n\nBut PostgreSQL is a relational database. It was designed around the relational model, where:\n\nArrays give you document-model convenience, but you lose relational promises. There are no foreign keys and no ON DELETE referential_action (like CASCADE) for array elements. If you delete a tags entry, the orphaned ID will remain in your array forever.\n\nThe rule of thumb is that if you find yourself in need of referential integrity - you most likely want a link table, not an array. Arrays are for data that shares the same lifecycle as the parent row. Not for relationships spanning across different tables.\n\nA practical example is the author of a blog post (one author might write multiple other posts), whereas a whitelist of IP addresses for a service account is only applicable to the given entity.\n\nWith JSONB being so flexible, you might wonder why we still bother with quirkier native types. The answer lies in the 'boring' part of the database: predictability and efficiency. An integer[] column guarantees that every element is an integer.\n\nArrays are also more storage-efficient for primitives because they don't carry the metadata overhead of JSON objects.\n\nThis post assumes basic knowledge of arrays. We won't cover the basics.\n\nthat is until you find an array with the arbitrary bounds. Which PostgreSQL allows.\n\nTo make sure you iterate correctly through any given array, always use array_lower() and array_upper() in PL/pgSQL\n\nor generate_subscripts() in SQL.\n\nWhen creating a table, you might expect strict typing. That's true for everything — except the array dimensions. You might think integer[][] enforces a 2D matrix. Except it does not. The [] syntax is effectively syntactic sugar. PostgreSQL does not enforce the number of dimensions of sub-arrays at the schema level at all by default.\n\nIf you want to enforce a specific array dimension, you cannot rely on the type definition. Instead, you must use a CHECK constraint.\n\nThe only exception is that PostgreSQL enforces uniformity of arrays on every nesting level. This means it rejects sub-arrays with different sizes.\n\nWhen accessing array values, it's important to consider that the syntax [1] and [1:1] are different. While the first one is an accessor, the second one acts like a constructor.\n\nWhen slicing an array, even if the slice is a single-element, it will be returned as a single-element array, not a scalar value.\n\nAccessing array values has a forgiving behaviour, making it more difficult to find underlying bugs:\n\nBut the single most confusing aspect that might trip you up coming from other programming languages is the fact that PostgreSQL treats multi-dimensional arrays as a single matrix, not an array of arrays.\n\nWhile in other languages you expect {1,2} as a result, PostgreSQL can't give it to you. It tries to return the first cell and fails (because the index is not complete).\n\nAnd to paraphrase Fletcher's \"Double Bubble\" analogy (which also went very wrong — extra points for getting the reference), you can't fix this by using slice notation.\n\nThe only way to solve this puzzle is to unnest the slice and re-aggregate the results.\n\nThe other alternative is to cast it to JSONB and back. Not pretty no matter how you look at it. If you need to work with complex multi-dimensional structures where each sub-array has independent meaning, just use JSONB. It will do exactly what you expect.\n\nWhile you can use a B-tree index on an array column, it won't help you unless you are looking for whole-array equality and sorting an array by dictionary rules.\n\nRendering B-tree indexes useless for any real-world index operations.\n\nWhen working with arrays, you actually need GIN (Generalized Inverted Index). If a B-tree index is a phone book, GIN is an index at the back of the book. To query one or more elements, you need to find all possible locations and then intersect them to find the locations that match.\n\nGIN indexes are designed for set operations, making presence the key feature, while ignoring order. Here are operators that GIN provides for arrays:\n\nContainment @> - matches rows that include ALL of the selected items.\n\nOverlap && - does the row include ANY of the selected items.\n\nThere's also <@ and = (equality), but they should be easy to understand.\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. While you might often hear (myself included) that you shouldn't use dynamic SQL for IN lists and should use ANY instead, there are some dangers you need to be aware of.\n\nThe ANY operator behaves very differently depending on which side of the comparison the array sits.\n\nThe advice to use ANY holds true when you are passing lists into the database. Instead of generating a query with 100 distinct parameters (WHERE id IN ($1, $2, ... $100)), which bloats your query cache and forces hard-parses, you should pass a single array parameter.\n\nThe trap is assuming this syntax is equally efficient when querying array columns. It is not. If you use ANY to check if a value exists inside a table column, you are effectively asking the database to loop.\n\nWhen you write WHERE 'feature' = ANY(tags), you are not actually using an array operator. What you wrote is a scalar integer equality operator = applied inside a loop construct. Since the scalar operator = is not part of array_ops, the planner assumes the index cannot help and falls back to a sequential scan.\n\nThe correct way to rewrite the query is:\n\nBecause a GIN index is built to work with sets, it is expensive to maintain. With a B-tree index, one row equals one index entry. In a GIN index, one row equals N index entries, where N is the number of elements in your array.\n\nThis leads to write multiplication. To prevent this, PostgreSQL defaults to using a \"fast update\" mechanism. This is a strategy where new entries are added to a pending list (an unsorted temporary buffer) and only merged into the main index structure later (during VACUUM).\n\nGiven the unsorted nature of a GIN index, it is an exception to VACUUM is a Lie, as VACUUM actually does perform structural maintenance here.While this makes INSERT operations manageable, it can slow down SELECTs. Every time you query the index, PostgreSQL must scan the organised main index plus the entire messy pending list. If that list grows large, your query performance might degrade.\n\nIf you operate a read-heavy workflow with infrequent writes, you should disable this to guarantee consistent reading performance.\n\nNow it's time to return to the document model. In PostgreSQL, rows are immutable (MVCC); there is no such thing as an \"in-place update\", and arrays are stored as atomic values. This results in a very uncomfortable truth — to modify a single element of an array, PostgreSQL must copy and rewrite the entire row.\n\nEvery single append rewrites the entire array, which in effect results in a rewrite of the entire row.\n\nWhen any array grows large enough (> 2 KB — see below), PostgreSQL moves it automatically to a separate storage area using TOAST. While this keeps the data row lean, it turns array updates into a severe performance bottleneck.\n\nThe difference this introduces is subtle but comes with a big impact. While a standard MVCC update simply copies the row version on the main heap, updating a TOASTed array forces PostgreSQL to fetch all external chunks, decompress the entire object into memory, apply the change, and then recompress and write the new full-size blob back to the TOAST table. This turns a simple modification into a CPU and I/O-intensive operation that rewrites the entire dataset rather than just the delta.\n\nThe threshold is derived from TOAST_TUPLES_PER_PAGE (default: 4), ensuring 4 tuples fit on a page.Threshold: ~2 KBWhere does the 2 KB value come from? The TOAST threshold is calculated to ensure at least four tuples can fit on a single 8 KB heap page. PostgreSQL uses this to balance efficiency against the overhead of TOAST indirection.\n\nBefore version 14, PostgreSQL relied on pglz — an algorithm prioritising compression ratio over speed. This made the \"decompress-modify-compress\" cycle of TOAST painful.\n\nPostgreSQL 14 introduced LZ4 as an alternative:\n\nLZ4 is significantly faster for both compression and decompression, with only slightly lower compression ratios. If you are working with large arrays, switching to LZ4 is one of the easiest ways to reduce the CPU penalty of TOAST.\n\nYou might have gained the impression that arrays are bad. When evaluating the use of arrays, the real question isn't how big the array is but rather how often do you modify it? An array of 10,000 elements that you write once and is read-only for the rest of its lifecycle is a completely valid use case. An array of 50 elements that you append to on every incoming request is the real villain here.\n\nIf you combine this with compression, you might get an interesting mix.\n\nUp until now, it might seem that arrays don't actually bring many benefits. While they can have rough edges around storage, they are incredibly useful for transport.\n\nThe fastest way to insert 5,000 rows isn't a loop in your application, and it's definitely not a massive VALUES (...), (...) string. It's unnest.\n\nAll that is needed is one network round trip, and one query to parse and plan. PostgreSQL handles the arrays row by row internally for you. This works both for UPSERTs and MERGE.\n\nStandard PostgreSQL arrays are polymorphic types (anyarray). This provides a powerful feature that allows a single function definition to operate on many different data types. They have to handle integers, strings, timestamps, and custom types equally well. But if you have specific data types, you can unlock significant performance gains by using specialised extensions.\n\nIf you are dealing exclusively with 4-byte integers (int4/integer), the built-in array operations are leaving performance on the table. The intarray extension provides specialised functions and index operators that are significantly faster than the generic implementation.\n\nTo use it, you must explicitly enable it:\n\nThe difference in developer ergonomics is immediate. To sort an array in standard SQL, you are forced to unnest, order, and re-aggregate. With intarray, you get native functions like sort() and uniq().\n\nBeyond raw management functions, it introduces a specialised query syntax that simplifies complex boolean logic. Instead of chaining multiple overlap (&&) and containment (@>) checks, you can express your requirements in a single \"query string\" using the @@ operator.\n\nThe only catch is the type restriction. intarray is strictly limited to signed 32-bit integers. If your values exceed 2 billion, you are back where you started.\n\nYou cannot talk about arrays in 2026 without mentioning pgvector. While it markets itself as a \"vector store\", internally it is simply an array of floats with a different mathematical focus.\n\nStandard arrays are binary: they care about Exact Matches (Overlap &&, Containment @>). Vectors are all about fuzzy distance (Cosine <=>, Euclidean <->).\n\nIf you are building search or recommendation features, pgvector allows you to treat your array column not as a list of \"facts\" (tag A, tag B), but as coordinates in semantic space.\n\nNevertheless, the architectural decision is exactly the same as using a standard array: you are trading strict structure for convenience. Since there is no way to \"join\" two rows based on how similar they are, you store the vector directly on the row. You accept a larger table size in exchange for the ability to ask, \"What is close to this?\".\n\nPS: Thanks to Matthias Feist for inspiring this article.",

    "fullText": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says AI is transforming what a single employee can accomplish at the company, signaling it's adopting a new hiring strategy.\n\nOn an earnings call with analysts Thursday, Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said the company is investing in more AI-native tools to elevate individual contributors and flatten teams. The effort is being somewhat constrained, however, by a lack of compute resources.\n\n\"We're starting to see projects that used to require big teams now be accomplished by a single very talented person,\" he said. \"I want to make sure that as many of these very talented people as possible choose Meta as the place that they can make the greatest impact.\"\n\nThe Facebook and Instagram parent, which reported fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, said it plans to boost AI spending by between 60% and 87% this year. Meta also said it already saw a significant increase in output per engineer last year, with the majority of that growth coming from the adoption of agentic coding.\n\nThough teams are on track to become smaller, finance chief Susan Li said on the earnings call that the company is still hungry for top talent. \"It remains a very competitive hiring market, but we'd like to invest aggressively where we can,\" she said.\n\nLi also noted that Meta closed out the December-ended quarter with 6% more employees than it had a year earlier, driven by hiring in areas such as monetization, infrastructure, Meta Superintelligence Labs, regulation, and compliance.\n\nMeta isn't alone in focusing on tiny teams. The strategy has become popular in the startup world, where founders have long prioritized scrappiness. It's a trend that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted would take hold back in February 2024.\n\n\"We're going to see 10-person companies with billion-dollar valuations pretty soon,\" he said at the time. \"In my little group chat with my tech CEO friends, there's this betting pool for the first year there is a one-person billion-dollar company, which would've been unimaginable without AI. And now [it] will happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, large companies have been thinning their middle manager ranks in recent years to boost efficiency by reducing bureaucracy, including Amazon and Intel. Meta's Zuckerberg wrote a memo in 2023 entitled \"Flatter is faster,\" and in late 2024, Google CEO Sundar Pichai told staff that the company cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of an efficiency push.\n\nThe trend isn't limited to tech companies. Retailers such as Walmart and Wayfair, and fintech firms like Block, have been moving managers into non-management roles. Some companies have also been conducting multiple rounds of mass layoffs. On Wednesday, Amazon said it would cut 16,000 corporate roles, the company's second round of layoffs in four months.\n\nOn Meta's earnings call, the company acknowledged that its goal of being able to lean on a smaller number of highly AI-savvy employees is challenged by a shortage of compute resources, as demand across the company has increased faster than its supply. Still, Zuckerberg expressed confidence in his outlook for greater efficiencies.\n\n\"I think that 2026 is going to be the year that AI starts to dramatically change the way that we work,\" he said. \"As we navigate this, our North Star is building the best place for individuals to make a massive impact.\"",

    "fullText": "Microsoft stock is getting crushed on Thursday.\n\nThe negative post-earnings reaction stems from investors' dismay over weaker-than-expected guidance in a key business area, alongside larger-than-expected spending on AI.\n\nMicrosoft earnings came in above both top and bottom line forecasts, with cloud revenue reaching $50 billion for the first time, but Microsoft stock still plunged 12%, its biggest decline since March 2020.\n\nWall Street analysts were laser-focused on AI spending heading into earnings, and the market's reaction to Microsoft and Meta's results shows that investors need to see strength elsewhere in the business to feel good about surging capex. Meta shares spiked on Thursday, and although its spending outlook jumped, that was offset by robust advertising business.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud platform revenue grew 39% on an annual basis, coming in above the forecast 38.4% but still below the 40% it posted in the previous quarter. According to finance pros, this is the primary factor driving Microsoft stock down.\n\n\"Microsoft allocated scarce GPU capacity away from Azure to 1P products, but the fact that BOTH Azure and the M365 segments fell a bit short is the key negative we're hearing that is driving the modest after-market fade,\" stated UBS analyst Karl Keirstead.\n\nOther Wall Street analysts think Microsoft could face challenges in the coming months if it can't find a way to boost its cloud revenue and win back Wall Street's confidence.\n\n\"I think sentiment around Microsoft is kind of negative right now. And if they don't really beat or re-accelerate Azure growth, the shares are probably not going to perform very well,\" Ryuta Makino of Gabelli Funds said.\n\nTech guru and University of Michigan professor Erik Gordon pointed to Microsoft's excessive spending as a catalyst for the stock's decline, noting that he sees it as a clear indication of a bubble in AI.\n\nTo get back to where it needs to be, though, Microsoft may need to spend even more. Blake Crawford, CIO of tech consulting firm Fusion Collective, raised the concern that much of its growth prospects hinge on the success of OpenAI.\n\n\"The number that sticks out like a sore thumb: remaining commercial obligations are up 110% to $625 billion, and OpenAI is a whopping 45% of that,\" he stated. \"That's a lot of hope-and-a-prayer that OpenAI will be able to deliver. And recognizing any potential upside will require significant capex.\"",

    "description": "In the final moments of Tesla's earnings call, Elon Musk urged companies to stop ignoring geopolitical risks by relying on foreign battery production.",
    "fullText": "\"Can other people, please, for the love of God, in the name of all that is holy, can others please build this stuff?\"\n\nElon Musk made the plea in the final moments of Tesla's earnings call on Wednesday, sounding a bit fired up.\n\nMusk had just finished giving a blunt warning to American companies: build more battery-making infrastructure in the US or risk falling behind.\n\nThe Tesla CEO argued that too many companies are underestimating their exposure to geopolitical risks posed by fragile supply chains, particularly for critical materials used in electric vehicles and energy storage.\n\n\"There are so many companies out there that are asleep at the switch with regard to geopolitical risk — or they just have their head in the sand and hope nothing bad will happen,\" Musk said. \"I'm way more paranoid than that.\"\n\nHe added that his concern has pushed Tesla to take unusual — and expensive — steps to protect its future, including building its own lithium-refining and battery-production facilities in Texas.\n\nIn December 2024, the company began processing lithium from its $1 billion Robstown, Texas, refinery. This month, Tesla announced it is producing dry-electrode 4680 cells with both anode and cathode made in Austin, which will end up in \"certain Model Ys.\"\n\nOn the call, Musk described those facilities as \"more advanced than anything else in the world,\" but stressed that Tesla does not want to be the only company making such investments.\n\n\"Why do we have to build these things? Why can others not also please build these things? I mean, it's very hard to build these things, and we're building them out of desperation, because nobody else is building lithium refineries and cathode refineries,\" Musk said.\n\n\"You know, we're pretty much the largest, but also the only lithium refinery and cathode refinery in America,\" he added. \"So, yeah. So. We're making moves to make sure that, no matter what happens, Tesla will prosper.\"\n\nIndependent research suggests Musk's worries are not unfounded.\n\nAn October analysis by the Dallas Federal Reserve identified 66 lithium projects across the US, but found that many remain in early development stages and face long timelines, high costs, and volatile lithium prices. Many projects could take a decade or more to reach commercial production, if they get there at all, the study found.\n\nA few other American automakers are beginning to invest as well.\n\nIn 2024, General Motors invested $625 million in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas Corporation's plans to build a lithium mine in Nevada. The facility is expected to become America's largest mine and plans to open between late 2026 and early 2027. In 2025, the US government took a minority stake in the project.\n\nTesla argues that its investments in battery infrastructure and energy storage have helped offset auto revenue pressure as its car business declines.\n\nTesla's lithium-based energy storage batteries — called Megapacks — reported Q4 revenue of over $3.8 billion, a 25% increase from the year-ago period.\n\nAnalysts express some concern that Tesla is committing tens of billions of dollars to long-term industrial projects, even as the company is openly uncertain about near-term returns.\n\n\"What we learned from the earnings call is that a whole bunch of billions of dollars will be flowing out of the company in the form of capital expenditures: more than $20 billion,\" David Meier, a senior analyst at Motley Fool, told Business Insider. \"That's a massive investment, but it's necessary as the plan is to raise 6 production plants, continue to develop AI infrastructure, and upgrade current manufacturing facilities.\"\n\nMusk warned that companies that fail to insulate against geopolitical risks could pay a steep price.\n\n\"Companies that don't do that,\" he said, \"a bunch of them will cease to exist.\"",

    "title": "I was laid off by Amazon and landed a new role 2 weeks later. Here's my advice for other laid-off tech workers.",
    "description": "After being laid off by Amazon in October 2025, Iren Azra Zou landed a new job two weeks later. She shared her top advice for other laid-off workers.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Iren Azra Zou, a 27-year-old in New Jersey. She is a founding engineer at tech startup Double Nickel, and previously worked as a software engineer at Amazon until being laid off in October 2025. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe day before Amazon announced layoffs in October, there were rumors that something big was coming.\n\nI had a strange feeling in my gut that I might be affected, even though I felt I was performing well and had met my goals earlier than expected. I'd been laid off from my previous tech job the year prior, in 2024, and I knew how, in situations like these, people can quickly become just numbers on a spreadsheet.\n\nIt was hard to sleep that night, and the next morning, I woke up to a 6 a.m. automated text from Amazon telling me to check my email for a message about my role. At that moment, I was pretty sure I had been laid off, which the message soon confirmed.\n\nThe first person I told was my husband, who was next to me in bed. After that, I messaged a few close coworkers to figure out who else had been affected. When I found out that some rock stars on my team had also been laid off, I was shocked.\n\nI was mentally prepared for my layoff — due to the speculation that cuts were coming — but I was also financially prepared.\n\nMy husband and I had taken steps to save aggressively and ensure we had enough savings to last for a while if we were both laid off. That financial cushion helped me stay calm when I found out I'd lost my job.\n\nI made a point to stick to my daily routines: coffee, exercise, and sleep schedule. I didn't want everything to feel chaotic.\n\nI quickly started looking for new job opportunities, and two weeks later, I landed and accepted an offer to start a software engineering role in December.\n\nHere's my advice for anyone who's recently been laid off:\n\nWhen you get laid off, you can't help but ask yourself, \"Why me?\"\n\nEventually, you come to terms with the reality that you can do everything right and still be included in a layoff simply because you're a number on a budget sheet. I know I worked hard and brought a lot to the table; a layoff didn't erase that.\n\nI was prepared for interviewers to ask about my Amazon layoff, but it didn't really come up. I think other companies recognized the scale of the layoff and that it wasn't performance-based, in many cases. I also think that, despite the layoff, having a household name like Amazon on my résumé was probably helpful.\n\nReflect on what you want in your next role and create a targeted job search plan to maximize your chances of landing it. I wanted to make sure I found the right fit, so this was really helpful for me.\n\nUpon reflection, I decided that the best fit for me might be at a smaller company with less bureaucracy than Amazon — and where I could better see the impact of my work.\n\nThe pro of working at a big company was that you could do one thing and it could affect millions of people in less than 30 minutes, which was exciting. However, the downside was that it sometimes felt like you were a very tiny piece in a giant machine.\n\nI was also hoping to land a remote role. For the last few months of my time at Amazon, I'd been required to commute one hour each way from New Jersey to the New York City office five days a week, which was really draining. I figured I might have more leverage to ask for remote flexibility at a smaller company than at Amazon, where so many people are competing for job postings.\n\nMy team at Amazon also didn't have many women, so I wanted to be in a place with a bit more diversity.\n\nI narrowed down my target: a software engineering role at a small company that offered remote flexibility — and where I felt I could grow and thrive.\n\nThis is not the time to be shy — most people will be sympathetic and eager to support you.\n\nI believe my LinkedIn presence — where I'm very active, posting career advice tailored to young professionals — helped me boost my visibility.\n\nThe day after my layoff, the chief technology officer of Double Nickel — a tech startup focused on truck driver recruitment — reached out to me on LinkedIn about a software engineering role they were hiring for. She said she'd seen my post-layoff LinkedIn post and, as a former Amazon employee herself, decided to reach out.\n\nThe role seemed like a good fit, so I applied and quickly landed an interview.\n\nFollowing the interviews, I was given an offer, which I accepted. We agreed to an arrangement where I'd work in a hybrid setup for the first few months to help with onboarding, and then transition to remote work around the end of February. So far, I'm very happy with the role.\n\nLooking back, I see the layoff as a turning point because it helped me clarify what I wanted in my next role. It was still a difficult experience, but I felt more grounded and optimistic as time went on — and ultimately landed a role I feel great about.",

    "title": "Data centers are powering Blackstone's $1.3 trillion investment empire",
    "description": "Blackstone sees major returns from its data center bet, and plans to continue to \"lean into\" the AI boom.",
    "fullText": "Data center investments have become the engine of Blackstone's growth.\n\nThe Wall Street investment giant reported that QTS, the data center developer and operator it took private in 2021, was the single largest driver of gains in the company's $1.3 trillion portfolio in 2025. The results were a clear sign that Blackstone's bets on digital infrastructure amid the artificial intelligence boom have reaped returns as other segments of its business, including real estate and private credit, have run into headwinds.\n\nIn a call on Wednesday to discuss Blackstone's year-end performance, Stephen Schwarzman, the firm's co-founder and chairman, called QTS now \"the world's largest data center platform.\"\n\nJon Gray, the company's president, said that investor interest in AI was a chief driver of strong inflows. The company reported $239 billion of inflows for the year, its highest total since a record year in 2021.\n\n\"You have what's happening in the AI world, economy growing faster, productivity picking up, and us investing in sectors we really like,\" Gray said. \"We think that will really get this flywheel going, which is why you hear this optimism.\"\n\nGray said its bets on AI and data centers had delivered for the company. Its infrastructure platform — powered by data center appreciation — had grown 40% during the year to $77 billion and had raised $4 billion from investors in the fourth quarter. Infrastructure investments earned 8.4% returns for the quarter and 23.5% for the year.\n\nBlackstone Real Estate Income Trust, the firm's $54 billion retail focused real estate investment fund, meanwhile, generated 8.1% returns during the year, more than double its benchmark for the sector. The fund, which is known as BREIT, is heavily invested in QTS.\n\nReal estate investments, broadly, were the weakest segment for Blackstone, delivering a 0.6% loss for its opportunistic strategy and 3% gains for its core assets.\n\nQTS, which Blackstone originally bought for $10 billion, was the \"largest single driver of returns\" for its infrastructure strategy, Blackstone Infrastructure Partners, as well as in real estate,\" Gray said.\n\nSchwarzman said the firm would continue to \"lean into key thematic areas such as digital infrastructure, including data centers, power, and electrification, private credit,\" as part of its broader investment strategy.\n\n\"The historic pace of investment taking place in the US to facilitate the development of artificial intelligence, including the design and manufacture of semiconductors, data center construction, and the expansion of power generation, is the key driver of economic growth today,\" Schwarzman said.\n\nGray added that the firm's $319 billion real estate platform would \"continue to invest in AI infrastructure and data centers.\"\n\nIn private lending, Gray said the artificial intelligence race and the hundreds of billions of dollars in related spending it will require would also feed the company's private credit business.\n\n\"The build-out of AI infrastructure requires a massive amount of private debt capital for the construction of fabs, energy supply, and data centers,\" Gray said. Fabs refer to computer chip manufacturing facilities.\n\nGray reported that Blackstone's investment grade private credit portfolio now totaled $130 billion, an increase of 30% during the year, while also acknowledging that BCRED, one of its largest credit fund had an \"uptick in redemptions\" tied to industry-wide concerns about default risks.\n\nBlackstone has long touted its focus on data centers.\n\nIn addition to QTS, the firm has invested in the AI developers Anthropic and OpenAI, the storage and high performance computing provider DDN, as well as energy providers who will deliver the prodigious electricity needed for AI computing. Last year, the firm, for instance, announced its $11.5 billion acquisition of TXNM Energy, a utility holding company. In 2024, the company was part of a group of investors that provided the data center operator CoreWeave with a $7.5 billion loan.\n\nBlackstone reported $14.5 billion of revenue for the year and $4.4 billion for the quarter, up 9% and 42% respectively.",

    "description": "Mark Anderson showed up at the Metropolitan Detention Center claiming to have a court order to free an inmate, federal prosecutors said.",
    "fullText": "A man was arrested for pretending to be an FBI agent in an effort to break an inmate out of the Brooklyn prison housing Luigi Mangione, who's awaiting trial over the shooting of UnitedHealthcare's CEO, prosecutors said on Thursday.\n\nMark Anderson showed up at the Metropolitan Detention Center jail claiming to have a court order to let an inmate walk free, federal prosecutors said in a criminal complaint released on Thursday.\n\nAfter Bureau of Prisons officials asked Anderson to identify himself, he produced a Minnesota driver's license and said he had weapons in his backpack, according to the complaint. He also \"displayed and threw at the BOP officers numerous documents,\" the complaint said.\n\nBureau of Prisons officials found a pizza cutter and barbecue fork in the bag, the complaint said.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Brooklyn have accused Anderson of impersonating an FBI agent. He was expected to appear before a magistrate judge in a federal court on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe criminal complaint does not name Mangione. A law enforcement source told Business Insider that Mangione was the inmate Anderson wanted to free from jail.\n\nAccording to the law enforcement source, Anderson had been working at a pizzeria in the New York City area.\n\nAn attorney for Anderson couldn't immediately be identified. An attorney for Mangione didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMangione has been jailed in the Metropolitan Detention Center while awaiting trial for the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024.\n\nHe is still in jail as of Thursday afternoon despite Anderson's alleged efforts, according to Bureau of Prison records.\n\nMangione is due in federal court in Manhattan on Friday morning, when a judge may rule on pending issues, including whether he will face the death penalty at his murder trial. US District Court Judge Margaret Garnett may also rule on whether prosecutors can show jurors key evidence from Mangione's December 9 arrest — including a 9mm handgun and a journal police say they recovered from his backpack.\n\nGarnett scheduled jury selection for the federal charges against Mangione for September. The Manhattan District Attorney's office has asked for a July trial date for its own murder trial against him. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to the charges in both cases.\n\nAs the only remaining federal jail in New York City, the MDC holds several high-profile defendants, including former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. The MDC also holds Oren and Tal Alexander, the luxury real estate brokers who are defendants in an ongoing rape trial in Manhattan.\n\nIn recent years, the MDC has also held Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Sam Bankman-Fried, and Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nWhile judges and defense attorneys have routinely criticized the MDC for its poor conditions, it doesn't have a history of jailbreaks.\n\nFor more than two years, the jail successfully contained Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, the Mexican drug lord who famously escaped twice from jails in Mexico, both times through tunnels dug underneath the buildings.\n\nCorrection: January 29, 2026 — An earlier version of the story incorrectly attributed the identity of the inmate to charging documents.",

    "title": "How to watch NBC: Live stream the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics, and more",
    "description": "NBC is the broadcast home of Super Bowl LX, the Winter Olympics, and much more in 2026. We'll show you how to watch NBC without cable.",
    "fullText": "NBC has long been a popular channel to have in your TV line-up, but the network's upcoming broadcasts of the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl LX make it all but necessary. Fortunately, there are a few easy ways to live stream the network, even if you don't have cable or an antenna. Keep reading to learn how to watch NBC online.\n\nNBC is the home of beloved sitcoms such as \"The Office\" and \"30 Rock\" and flagship procedurals like the \"Law & Order\" and \"Chicago\" universes. In addition to a massive selection of currently airing scripted programming (in addition to series like \"Saturday Night Live\"), the network has become a key player in the news and sports scene. The \"Today\" show and NBC News have long been among the network's main draws, but NBC has increasingly invested in sports over the years, becoming a must-have destination for fans of the NFL, NBA, and the Olympics. NBC is also the broadcast home of flagship events, like the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Super Bowl LX, and the 2026 Emmy Awards.\n\nWhether you're hoping to stream NBC live or get caught up with past network programming on-demand, we've got you covered. Below, we've outlined everything you need to know about tuning in to the network without cable, including a breakdown of NBCUniversal's direct streaming service, Peacock.\n\n*NBC is only available in select regions on Sling.\n\nNBC's direct streaming counterpart is Peacock, a one-stop shop for all things NBCUniversal. There are three tiers of service, ranging from Peacock Select ($8 a month) to Peacock Premium Plus ($17 a month). Select is fairly pared-down and doesn't offer live events, so we recommend Premium or Premium Plus to unlock the full suite of on-demand offerings from the streaming service.\n\nPeacock has a massive collection of-demand seasons of NBC and Bravo shows, among other programming. New episodes typically land on the streaming service the day after their linear broadcast, so if you don't mind waiting a day (and watching with ads), the $11 a month Premium option should do the trick. However, if you'd like to stream NBC live and watch on-demand programming without ads, you'll need Peacock Premium for $17 a month. Both Premium and Premium Plus will carry the Super Bowl and the Olympics.\n\nPeacock Premium Plus subscription is $17 a month. The extra cost gets rid of most ads, allows you to download select titles, and also comes with your local NBC channel.\n\nDirecTV is another solid way to live stream NBC, along with other popular channels. In our guide to the best live TV streaming services, DirecTV ranks as the best cable alternative. NBC is available in several packages, including all signature plans and a couple of cheaper genre packs. Signature plans start at $90 a month for the Entertainment plan, which carries NBC and 90+ other channels (including pretty much anything you'd find in a standard cable plan).\n\nNBC is also available in MyNews and MySports genre packs. MyNews costs $40 a month and comes with 10+ popular news channels, while MySports costs $70 a month and offers around 20 sports networks and access to ESPN Unlimited. All DirecTV plans come with a five-day free trial for new customers.\n\nPreviously known as AT&T TV, DirecTV offers streaming access to a large selection of live channels, including most key networks typically found in traditional cable packages.\n\nIf you're looking for more of a budget-friendly pick, Sling TV will also allow you to live stream NBC and a handful of other channels. It's a great budget live TV service, but it's important to note that local channel coverage (like NBC) varies from region to region, so you should see what's available in your ZIP code before signing up. NBC-friendly plans (where available) include Sling Select and Sling Blue.\n\nSling Select offers around 10 channels and costs $25 a month when local networks are involved. Sling Blue carries 40+ channels and costs $50 a month for those with local channel access. If you're looking for a more comprehensive cable alternative, you can get Sling Orange + Blue for $65 a month.\n\nFor just the essentials without any extra fluff, Sling TV is the streaming service you're looking for. It's more customizable than other plans, with three options you can choose from, so you pay for only what you need. New members often get a chunky discount on their first month.",

    "description": "Trump's admin posted its proposed rule to overhaul student-loan repayment, including new caps on borrowing. The public will have 30 days to comment.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's sweeping student-loan changes are a key step closer to becoming reality.\n\nThe Department of Education announced on Thursday that it has published the proposed rule on student-loan repayment changes in the Federal Register, a key step the department must complete before implementing the final rule.\n\nAfter Trump signed his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation into law, the department began negotiations with stakeholders on the proposed changes, which included new borrowing caps, the elimination of existing income-driven repayment plans, and a new repayment plan with less generous terms than those of existing plans.\n\nPublishing the rule to the Federal Register is the next step in the negotiated rulemaking process, allowing the department to progress toward implementing the rule in July.\n\n\"With consensus reached in support of the Department's proposed rule, we have a clear path forward to fulfill the President's promise of making higher education more affordable and ensuring that every professional in America—from teachers and nurses to physicians and clergy—can pursue their careers without taking on debt they may never be able to repay,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement.\n\nOnce the rule is formally published on Friday, the public will have until March 2 to comment on the proposed rule. The department said in its press release that it would consider the comments and \"may make changes to the proposed regulations in response to substantive comments.\"\n\nOne key change in the rule is the creation of a new Repayment Assistance Plan. It would set borrowers' payments at 1% to 10% of their income, and any remaining balance would be forgiven after 30 years. It's less generous than the SAVE plan, which the legislation eliminates. SAVE, created by former President Joe Biden, allowed for lower monthly payments and forgiveness after 10 years.\n\nWhile the spending legislation would not eliminate SAVE before 2028, the department announced a proposed settlement which, if approved, would accelerate that timeline and require borrowers to switch to a new plan within a limited timeframe.\n\nIn addition to the new repayment plans, the proposed rule would place new borrowing caps on graduate and professional degrees while eliminating the Grad PLUS program, which allowed graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs.\n\nChanges for defaulted student-loan borrowers are also coming; the rule would allow borrowers in default to rehabilitate their loans twice, a process that would require them to work with their servicer on a payment plan that would eventually result in the default status being removed from their credit reports. Borrowers were previously allowed just one chance to rehabilitate.",

    "title": "I'm trying to guess why Elon Musk wants to mash SpaceX into xAI — or Tesla. I'm stumped.",
    "description": "Elon Musk's companies already share employees, resources and investors. Maybe a possible merger of SpaceX and xAI  — or Tesla — would simplify things.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk starts and owns lots of companies. Maybe he's going to change that, a bit: The world's richest man is reportedly working on a plan to merge two of his most valuable companies into one megacompany.\n\nWhich one of his companies is a question: Reuters reports that Musk wants to merge xAI — his very valuable AI company that has already merged with the company that used to be called Twitter — into SpaceX, his very valuable rocket company. And Bloomberg reports that SpaceX is also considering a merger with Tesla, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe SpaceX-xAI tie-up could help Musk build data centers in space. \"The combination would bring Musk's rockets, Starlink satellites, the X social media platform and ​Grok AI chatbot under one roof,\" the Reuters report says. Then again, Reuters also says it doesn't know several key details about the theoretical deal, including \"its ‌primary rationale.\"\n\nAnd to be honest, the rationale seems a little obscure to me, too.\n\nThe main reason I can think of to merge one private company with another private company that's about to go public would be to make it easier for the smaller private company to finance itself.\n\nIn this case, that would mean that xAI wouldn't have to rely on the private markets as it races after the likes of OpenAI, Google, and Meta in the competition for AI talent and chips. It could tap the public market instead.\n\nThe problem with that theory: People in the private market are lining up to throw money at xAI, which just raised $20 billion. The company boasted that it was only going to raise $15 billion, but people kept throwing money at it, so it had to go and raise more.\n\nAnd, Muskian boasting aside, that makes lots of sense: Despite all the AI bubble chat, people are eager to put money into big, privately owned AI companies, as OpenAI and Anthropic prove every time they raise a ton of money, which happens to be all the time.\n\nJust as important: People are eager to give Elon Musk money because he's made a lot of people a lot of money from Tesla, and they're eager to give him another chance. (That's why the people who helped him fund his value-destroying Twitter deal never once complained about it in public: They wanted a chance to invest in his next deal.)\n\nI've asked Musk, SpaceX, and xAI for comment. It may be worth noting that Musk, who complains about coverage of his companies all the time, did not complain when someone retweeted the Reuters story Thursday afternoon.\n\nI suppose you could also try to argue that SpaceX and xAI make sense together because a bunch of their work overlaps, like the theoretical xAI space data centers that could get built with SpaceX rockets.\n\nBut Elon Musk has always treated his various companies as one big company when it suits him. He moves engineering and managing talent from one company to another when he wants — even when those employees work for Tesla, which is publicly owned, and theoretically should have a problem with lending its staff to other people's companies.\n\nSometimes there are complaints about Musk using resources from one company to help another — or, perhaps, himself. But Musk has pretty much ignored all of those complaints. I can't believe he's interested in moving xAI into SpaceX because he cares about corporate governance.\n\nAnother reason to mash the companies together might be to reward investors who bet on one private company by giving them publicly traded shares in the combined company. But, again, that doesn't really track here: Musk has a bunch of loyal backers, like Fidelity and Valor Equity Partners, which try to get into all his deals, and are already in both companies.\n\nSo maybe there will be a big galaxy-brained rationale for mushing xAI or Tesla and SpaceX together, and we just have to wait for Musk to unveil it. In the absence of that, here's my last guess: Musk, who is already reportedly trying to time his SpaceX IPO to \"coincide with a rare planetary alignment and his birthday,\" per Financial Times reports, just wants his giant SpaceX IPO to be even bigger. Prior to Thursday's report, SpaceX was supposed to go public at a $1.5 trillion valuation — the largest IPO in history. So maybe he's just trying to boost that valuation by a half trillion more.",

    "fullText": "Darren Aronofsky used to be a director who made interesting, if sometimes polarizing, films like Black Swan, Mother!, Noah, and The Wrestler. But it seems like a safe bet that people won’t need to debate whether Aronofsky’s new project is any good. Because anyone with eyes can see that it looks like low-effort AI slop. To put it another way, it looks like absolute dogshit.\n\nAronofsky is producing a new short-form series with his AI production company Primordial Soup titled “On This Day… 1776,” according to the Hollywood Reporter. The series uses tech from Google DeepMind to create short videos about the Revolutionary War, published on the YouTube channel for Time magazine. In 2018, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff bought Time, and the cloud software giant is sponsoring this monstrosity of a series.\n\nThe series uses human voice actors who belong to the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), which is clearly an attempt to tamp down on the inevitable backlash from both inside and outside Hollywood. Folks inside the movie and TV industry have fiercely pushed back against the use of AI to replace the skilled artists and actors who create the media we watch. That concern obviously comes from a place of self-interest because nobody wants to be pushed out of a job. But they also care about the quality of the work being produced. And there’s also been a revolt among the average consumer, people who’ve been inundated with the lowest-grade AI garbage imaginable. It’s really everywhere now.\n\nThe first episode, titled “The Flag,” is three-and-a-half minutes long and attempts to tell the story of George Washington raising the Continental Union Flag in Somerville, Massachusetts. It offers nothing compelling in the way of narrative. It’s the kind of thing that you’d skip over as a cut-scene in a particularly bad video game.\n\nEverything has a dead and creepy quality, as the actors’ audio is poorly synced with the lips of the AI concoctions.\n\nHave you ever seen a Spaghetti Western from the 1960s where the audio just doesn’t seem to match, even though it was clearly shot with actors speaking English, and the “dub” is in English? That happened because the audio was added in post-production, a result of direct sound recording being expensive in Italy during the post-war era. You get the same effect here, though there’s no good reason. Well, no good reason outside of presumably saving a ton of money on hiring human actors.\n\nThe second episode, titled “Common Sense,” tries to tell the story of Thomas Paine writing Common Sense. Benjamin Franklin makes an appearance, though it proves that the most recognizable of the founding fathers in this series are the weirdest to look at.\n\nThe episode jumps around incoherently, much like the first episode, without grounding the viewer in anything we should care about. It’s truly an ugly mess. And if you bother to pause the scenes, you can spot the kind of telltale anomalies that plague other AI-generated video projects, like strangely deformed hands in the background characters. Hands are always giving this stuff away.\n\nThen there are the words that appear on screen in the trailer, like the pamphlet that’s supposed to include the word “America” but instead reads something closer to “Λamereedd.”\n\nHappy to see that there is no need to worry about the historical accuracy of new 1776 AI slop because it happens in the mystical land of Λamereedd.\n\n— Mateusz Fafinski (@calthalas.bsky.social) January 29, 2026 at 1:33 PM\n\nThe series is specifically made for this sestercentennial year of America’s founding, and each episode will reportedly drop on the 250th anniversary of the day it happened, according to the Hollywood Reporter. And that’s certainly a fun concept if the final product were something worth watching. But it’s not. It’s garbage. The people who are making and distributing it obviously don’t think so.\n\n“This project is a glimpse at what thoughtful, creative, artist-led use of AI can look like — not replacing craft, but expanding what’s possible and allowing storytellers to go places they simply couldn’t before,” Ben Bitonti, president of Time Studios, told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe reaction on social media hasn’t been so kind. “I know my expectations were low but holy fuck Darren Aronofsky producing AI slop wasn’t on my bingo card,” one X user wrote. Over on Bluesky another joked, “Used to be that when Darren Aronofsky wanted to feature a dead-eyed actor, he’d just employ Jared Leto.”\n\nAnd other users have been picking apart all the anomalies, with one Bluesky critic writing: “Love the new Aronofsky scene where the colonist takes off his hat to cheer, revealing that underneath it was a second and somehow larger hat.”\n\nLove the new Aronofsky scene where the colonist takes off his hat to cheer, revealing that underneath it was a second and somehow larger hat\n Masterful artsistic choice\n\n— Matt Baume 🏳️‍🌈 (@mattbaume.bsky.social) January 29, 2026 at 10:35 AM\n\n“Nothing represents The End of America after a 250-year run quite like using AI slop to depict the creation of the Declaration of Independence,” another user quipped.\n\nThe videos have been up at Time’s YouTube channel for over 7 hours as of the time of this writing, but they’re not gaining much attention in their original format. The first episode has just 5,000 views. The second episode has a little over 2,000. Social media posts ridiculing the production seem to be faring better, simply because people are making fun of them. One video on Bluesky has over 2,500 quote posts, with almost all seemingly making jokes about how awful it looks.\n\nGizmodo reached out to Ken Burns for comment, but didn’t immediately receive a reply.",

    "title": "I tested over two dozen of the best cashmere sweaters — here are 14 brands I'm wearing all winter",
    "description": "I compared 28 of the best cashmere sweaters, from budget brands to luxe investment pieces. My favorites are soft, insulating, and easy to care for.",
    "fullText": "Cashmere is a thin, soft, and finely textured knit fabric made from the fibers brushed from the undercoat of cashmere goats. It gets its name from the Kashmir region of northern India and is distinct from the fibers harvested from sheep that make wool. Even though they're related materials, cashmere is three times more insulating than wool. It's also naturally more breathable.\n\nThe more expensive a cashmere sweater is, the more you can denote from its laborious brushing and production process.\n\nCashmere is only collected as little as once a year, depending on the area, and it can take approximately 4-5 fully grown cashmere goats to make just one sweater. The goats' hair is brushed into \"tops.\" Luxury brands like Loro Piana and Brunello Cucinelli bid on the premium tops, which are the cleanest and palest in color.\n\nIn the US, cashmere must meet a certain criteria:\n\n100% cashmere is more sustainable than, say, polyester. Still, it does take a toll on the environment, and the available quantity relies on the well-being of goat herds, their habitat, and their caretakers. As with any naturally regenerative resource, paying more means investing in the quality of life for those who produce it.\n\nCashmere is graded according to the diameter and length of the fibers. Grade A cashmere uses ultra-fine fibers that are a minimum of 14 microns thick, which feel softer and resist pilling better. Grades B and C cashmere uses thicker fibers that feel less smooth.\n\nCashmere sweaters can last you a lifetime with the right care. Hanging cashmere sweaters will make them stretch, so you should instead keep them folded in a drawer. But beware: this is exactly where hungry moths can be found lying in wait. Keep them at bay with cedar blocks to prevent them from chewing holes through your cashmere clothing.\n\n\"Gauge\" refers to the number of stitches per inch. A higher gauge usually means a lighter fabric. 16-gauge sweaters feel smoother and have a more structured finish, which is ideal for workwear and layering. Looser gauges, like a 5-gauge, have a more casual fit, but may stretch out faster. If you prefer these, look for those with ribbing around cuffs and hems which should help maintain its shape.\n\n\"Ply\" refers to the number of yarn strands twisted together. The higher the ply, the more thick the fabric. 2-ply cashmere is warmer and more dense than single-ply. Single-ply sweaters have that delicate, airy feel, but 2-ply offers a better balance between softness and structure in the long run.",

    "description": "Jeffrey Epstein's victims have accused Bank of America of facilitating Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking operation.",
    "fullText": "Sex trafficking victims of Jeffrey Epstein scored a mixed victory in court on Thursday after a federal judge tossed one of their lawsuits against a bank — but greenlit part of another case against a different bank.\n\nUS District Judge Jed Rakoff allowed portions of a proposed class-action lawsuit filed by victims against Bank of America to move forward, but dismissed other parts of the case.\n\nRakoff dismissed the entirety of a similar lawsuit the victims had filed against another bank, BNY.\n\nThe Epstein victims had accused Bank of America of ignoring red flags for Epstein's sex-trafficking operation. Their lawsuit said the bank facilitated millions of dollars — including over $170 million from former Apollo CEO Leon Black, who said he paid Epstein for tax advice — into Epstein's accounts. They said the funds were used in part to pay hush money to victims.\n\nRakoff dismissed the parts of the lawsuit that alleged the bank \"knowingly participated\" in Epstein's sex-trafficking operation, as well as allegations that it failed to follow know-your-customer laws in monitoring Epstein's accounts.\n\nBut the judge allowed the victims' claims that Bank of America was a \"knowing beneficiary\" of the sex-trafficking operation to move forward.\n\nThe judge tossed an entire lawsuit that the same lawyers filed against BNY, also known as Bank of New York Mellon Corp. The lawsuit had alleged BNY ignored red flags while processing Epstein's wire transfers and by extending credit to a modeling agency financed by Epstein and owned by Jean-Luc Brunel, who died in his prison cell in 2022 while awaiting trial in France for rape charges.\n\nDavid Boies, an attorney representing the Epstein victims, said he would appeal the dismissal of the BNY lawsuit.\n\n\"We are pleased that the Court sustained our sex trafficking claims against Bank of America, and we look forward to trying that case in May,\" Boies said in a statement. \"We respectively disagree with the Court's dismissal of the complaint against Bank of New York Mellon and we will seek appellate review.\"\n\nRakoff had expressed skepticism about the strength of both lawsuits during a December hearing in his lower Manhattan courtroom. He called them both \"a model of high-pitched rhetoric\" and compared them unfavorably to earlier lawsuits the same attorneys had brought on behalf of Epstein victims against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, which settled for $290 million and $75 million, respectively.\n\nAt the end of the December hearing, Rakoff gave the lawyers two weeks to file amended versions of their lawsuits with more detail.\n\nThe revisions appeared not to satisfy Rakoff. He dismissed the counts \"with prejudice\" — meaning the lawyers won't get another chance to amend their lawsuits — and said he would issue an opinion explaining his reasoning by February 13.\n\n\"We are pleased with the court's decision dismissing the lawsuit in its entirety, which reinforces that BNY had no involvement in Epstein's crimes,\" BNY spokesperson Ryan Wells told Business Insider. \"BNY has great sympathy for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein and believes his crimes should be fully investigated and prosecuted.\"\n\nIn court, Bank of America lawyers said it offered nothing more than \"routine banking services\" for Epstein. Bill Haldin, a spokesperson for the bank, said it looked forward to \"a full review of the facts\" as the case moved forward.\n\n\"We are pleased the court dismissed most of the claims,\" Haldin said. \"On the remaining claims, it's important to understand the underlying facts have not been reviewed at this stage of the litigation.\"\n\nRakoff had previously put the lawsuits on a fast track, setting deadlines for summary judgment for the spring, which will give Bank of America another chance to have the case dismissed. A trial is scheduled for May.\n\nThe litigation is playing out in the same courthouse where victims have pressed judges to force the Department of Justice to publish its internal files related to Epstein, the well-connected pedophile who killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex-trafficking charges.\n\nThe Justice Department has blown past a December 19 deadline required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed in November, to release all of its files. Victims and members of Congress have asked judges to appoint an independent monitor to oversee the release of the files. Judges have said they don't have the power to make such an appointment.\n\nIn a court filing Tuesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the department had reviewed \"millions of pages of materials, applying redactions as appropriate\" and would publish them \"in the near term.\"",

    "fullText": "The founder of an auto parts company whose bankruptcy rattled Wall Street and prompted a debate about private credit has been charged with fraud.\n\nManhattan federal prosecutors on Thursday charged Patrick James and his brother Edward James in a multibillion-dollar fraud scheme that they allege involved years of fake invoices and the double- and even triple-pledging of assets.\n\nPatrick James is the founder and former CEO of auto parts maker First Brands, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September. Its bankruptcy was followed by the collapse of subprime auto-lender Tricolor Holdings, sparking a broader debate about the health of the credit market that drew in JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.\n\nHis brother had been a senior executive at the company.\n\nThe two men were charged with wire fraud, bank fraud, and conspiracy, including money laundering conspiracy. Patrick James faces an additional count, stemming from allegations that he ran a continuing financial crimes enterprise. A third former executive, Peter Andrew Brumbergs, has pleaded guilty in the case.\n\nProsecutors said the men inflated invoices, repeatedly pledged the same assets as collateral for loans, and falsified corporate financial statements in a series of schemes that yielded billions of dollars in financing.\n\nA spokesperson for Patrick James said he denies the charges.\n\n\"He built First Brands from nothing,\" the spokesperson said, adding, \"Mr. James looks forward to presenting his case in court.\"\n\nEdward James's lawyer issued a statement blasting his client's arrest in Ohio as \"needless theater.\"\n\n\"We look forward to appearing in New York on his behalf, and we have complete confidence in Mr. James,\" the lawyer, Seth DuCharme, said.\n\nJefferies and UBS are among the financial firms that have acknowledged exposure to First Brands.\n\n\"The James brothers obtained billions for First Brands — and millions for themselves — by presenting their lenders with the impression of a successful, growing international business,\" Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton said in a statement.",

    "description": "In a hearing, a judge advised YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson and Virtual Dining Concepts to settle their legal dispute over MrBeast Burger.",
    "fullText": "A judge urged MrBeast and his burger business partner to settle their legal battle to avoid airing \"dirty laundry\" — but paved the way for the case to go to trial.\n\nAt a hearing on Thursday, New York County Supreme Court Judge Jennifer Schecter appeared skeptical about the damages sustained by either side, both of which are suing the other. Despite that, she ruled that both cases could proceed.\n\nVDC said it looked \"forward to having our day in court.\" MrBeast's reps declined to comment.\n\nYouTube's top star, MrBeast (real name Jimmy Donaldson), launched MrBeast Burger, a largely delivery-only venture selling burgers and fried chicken sandwiches, with Virtual Dining Concepts in 2020. Donaldson hoped it would become the cornerstone of a food empire, but the partnership was plagued by tensions over undercooked orders and Donaldson's demands for more control of the business.\n\nIn July 2023, Donaldson's company sued VDC, portraying the YouTuber as a victim seeking to escape an unfair contract that had tarnished his reputation as a philanthropic, family-friendly entertainer. VDC fired back with its own lawsuit, saying Donaldson had walked away from a promising deal and failed to meet various contractual obligations, including appearances and promos.\n\nA big issue for the judge was the level of damages claimed by both sides. She said the evidence presented by MrBeast about bad Yelp reviews over MrBeast Burger orders seemed \"very compelling.\" But she said she was \"very skeptical\" that they \"would materially and irreparably harm the MrBeast brand under the circumstances.\"\n\nThe judge took special interest in MrBeast's argument that VDC owes him royalties over burger sales.\n\nVDC says MrBeast's camp instructed the company to reinvest his royalty share back into the business. MrBeast's side says it's entitled to royalties now that the partnership has fallen apart.\n\nThe judge urged the parties to think about seeking a business solution rather than a legal one, given the cost of fighting the case in court.\n\n\"If they can't take each other anymore, they should be thinking about a buyout, and it may be costly, but at the end of the day, maybe that's what these parties both should want,\" she said.\n\nThe judge also admitted some fascination with the case involving the world's biggest YouTuber and his ill-fated business venture.\n\nDuring the hour-and-a-half hearing, MrBeast's lawyer, Steven Marenberg, alleged that the burger complaints harmed the YouTuber's reputation.\n\nHe said the \"systemic, deep\" dissatisfaction with MrBeast Burger could \"impact, irreparably,\" the YouTuber's brand.\n\nShawn Rabin, VDC's lawyer, countered by claiming that MrBeast wanted to lower the value of the business so he could \"buy it on the cheap\" and take control of it.",

Wednesday’s announcement is the first time since July that rates have not been cut.\n\n“He is hurting our Country, and its National Security,” Trump wrote. “We should have a substantially lower rate now that even this moron admits inflation is no longer a problem or threat. He is costing America Hundreds of Billions of Dollar a year in totally unnecessary and uncalled for INTEREST EXPENSE.”\n\nPowell has not said that inflation is not a problem. He said in December only that it has inched closer to the Fed’s target level, and otherwise insisted the U.S. faces risks from multiple stressors, such as low job growth and economic uncertainty.\n\nTrump appeared eager to push those and any other fiscal concerns under the rug on Thursday. “Because of the vast amounts of money flowing into our Country because of Tariffs, we should be paying the LOWEST INTEREST RATE OF ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD,” he wrote.\n\nThe MAGA leader has repeatedly used hyperbole regarding claims about tariff revenue under his second administration. There is a broad consensus among economists that such levies are not a durable solution to fiscal crises, as higher costs inevitably shift to consumers over time.\n\n“Most of these countries are low interest rate paying cash machines, thought of as elegant, solid, and prime, only because the U.S.A. allows them to be,” Trump went on. “The Tariffs being charged to them, while bringing in $BILLIONS to us, still allows most of them to have a significant trade surplus, though much smaller, with our beautiful, formerly abused Country.”\n\n“In other words, I have been very nice, kind, and gentle to countries all over the World,” he concluded, before demanding again the Fed should “substantially lower interest rates, NOW!”\n\nEarlier this month, Powell made headlines when he defied Trump by releasing a video message regarding a criminal investigation opened by the Department of Justice into the renovation of the Central Bank’s headquarters.\n\n“I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law,” Powell said in his video message. “But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment on this story.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk took the final moments of Tesla's earnings call to warn American companies about global battery supply risks.\n\nTesla has built its own lithium refinery and battery facility to avoid disruptions: \"We wish others would build this,\" Musk said.\n\nRecent studies show renewed interest in building the facilities — but construction has slowed.\n\n\"Can other people, please, for the love of God, in the name of all that is holy, can others please build this stuff?\"\n\nElon Musk made the plea in the final moments of Tesla's earnings call on Wednesday, sounding a bit fired up.\n\nMusk had just finished giving a blunt warning to American companies: build more battery-making infrastructure in the US or risk falling behind.\n\nThe Tesla CEO argued that too many companies are underestimating their exposure to geopolitical risks posed by fragile supply chains, particularly for critical materials used in electric vehicles and energy storage.\n\n\"There are so many companies out there that are asleep at the switch with regard to geopolitical risk — or they just have their head in the sand and hope nothing bad will happen,\" Musk said. \"I'm way more paranoid than that.\"\n\nHe added that his concern has pushed Tesla to take unusual — and expensive — steps to protect its future, including building its own lithium-refining and battery-production facilities in Texas.\n\nIn December 2024, the company began processing lithium from its $1 billion Robstown, Texas, refinery. This month, Tesla announced it is producing dry-electrode 4680 cells with both anode and cathode made in Austin, which will end up in \"certain Model Ys.\"\n\nOn the call, Musk described those facilities as \"more advanced than anything else in the world,\" but stressed that Tesla does not want to be the only company making such investments.\n\n\"Why do we have to build these things? Why can others not also please build these things? I mean, it's very hard to build these things, and we're building them out of desperation, because nobody else is building lithium refineries and cathode refineries,\" Musk said.\n\n\"You know, we're pretty much the largest, but also the only lithium refinery and cathode refinery in America,\" he added. \"So, yeah. So. We're making moves to make sure that, no matter what happens, Tesla will prosper.\"\n\nIndependent research suggests Musk's worries are not unfounded.\n\nAn October analysis by the Dallas Federal Reserve identified 66 lithium projects across the US, but found that many remain in early development stages and face long timelines, high costs, and volatile lithium prices. Many projects could take a decade or more to reach commercial production, if they get there at all, the study found.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's SpaceX and xAI are in discussions to merge ahead of a blockbuster public offering planned for later this year. The combination would bring Musk’s rockets, Starlink satellites, the X social media platform and Grok AI chatbot under one roof, according to a person briefed on the matter and two ​recent company filings seen by Reuters.\n\nHow could space-based data centers reduce AI costs?\n\nWhat would the proposed SpaceX-xAI merger involve?\n\nWhat defense applications are planned for merged companies?\n\nWhy is Musk combining his different business ventures?\n\nThe plan, which Reuters is reporting exclusively, would give fresh momentum to SpaceX’s effort to launch data centers into orbit as Musk battles for supremacy in the rapidly ‌escalating AI race against tech giants like Google, Meta and OpenAI.\n\nMusk, the world's richest man, is the CEO of both the private space company SpaceX and the artificial intelligence company xAI, which controls his social media platform X. He also runs electric automaker Tesla, tunnel ‌company The Boring Co. and neurotechnology company Neuralink.\n\nMusk, SpaceX, and xAI did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nUnder the proposed merger, shares of xAI would be exchanged for shares in SpaceX. Two entities have been set up in Nevada to facilitate the transaction, the person said.\n\nCorporate filings in Nevada show that those entities were set up on January 21. One of them, a limited liability company, lists SpaceX and Bret Johnsen, the company's chief financial officer, as managing members, while the other lists Johnsen as the company's only officer, the filings show.\n\nThe filings don't contain additional information about the purpose of the companies ⁠or their role in any deal.\n\nJohnsen did not respond to a Reuters ‌request for comment.\n\nThe person, who requested anonymity because the discussions are confidential, said that some xAI executives could be given the option to receive cash instead of SpaceX stock as part of the deal. A final agreement, however, hasn't been signed, and the timing and structure of the transaction remain fluid, the person cautioned.\n\nSpaceX is already the world's most ‍valuable privately held company, last valued at $800 billion in a recent insider share sale. xAI was valued at $230 billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal. Reuters and other media have reported that SpaceX plans to go public some time this year, with a valuation expected above $1 trillion.\n\nThrough xAI, Musk is building out a massive supercomputer for AI training in Memphis, Tennessee, called Colossus. Last year, SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI as part of the startup’s $5 billion equity ​fundraising, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time.",

    "fullText": "If you own gold or silver right now, you probably feel smart and slightly anxious at the same time.\n\nI’ve been following this move tick‑by‑tick, and the most striking thing is how calm Jerome Powell sounds compared with what gold and silver are actually doing.\n\nGold has climbed toward $5,600 an ounce after roughly a 64% jump last year, according to the Economic Times. The report also highlights Silver's sprint toward the 120‑dollar level as investment demand, industrial use, and tight supply collide.\n\nAt the same press conference where those price moves were hanging over the market, Powell told reporters “not to take much message macroeconomically” about the significant price increases of precious metals, as highlighted in a clip posted on Cointelegraph’s X (formerly Twitter) page.\n\nThat single line is the clearest view you’re going to get into how the Fed thinks about this metals spike.\n\nWhat really set people off wasn’t just that gold is at record levels. It was the way Powell tried to separate that price action from the Fed’s reaction function.\n\n“Jerome Powell says not to read much into the rise in gold prices,” Cointelegraph captioned the clip on X during the press conference, paraphrasing his answer to a question about the metal’s surge.\n\nMeanwhile, the moves have been anything but minor.\n\nGold recently broke above $5,000 per ounce on safe‑haven demand tied to geopolitical tensions and uncertainty about future Fed policy, even before it extended toward the 5,600‑dollar region, according to Plus500.\n\nMarket uncertainty resets silver, gold bets\n\nBillionaire Dalio sends 2-word warning on markets\n\nEvery major analyst’s gold price forecast for 2026\n\nThe combination of rate‑cut expectations, geopolitical stress and central‑bank diversification has driven precious metals to record or near‑record levels, while sharp pullbacks remain a real threat after such a steep rise, according to CME Group analysis.\n\nWhen I put those pieces together, it feels like the Fed is quietly saying, “We see it, but we’re not going to let gold bully us,” which is not the message metals traders wanted to hear.\n\nIf Powell was trying to calm things down, it didn’t work on the hard‑money crowd. Peter Schiff, who has been hammering the case for gold and silver for years, immediately framed the market’s reaction as a referendum on the Fed.",

He did not enter a plea; instead, he waived his right to a speedy arraignment while he seeks private representation.\n\nA new arraignment hearing has been scheduled for Feb. 12.\n\nThe sheriff’s office said that the criminal complaint obtained by FOX40, Varoff faces five counts of oral copulation of a person under 18 and five counts of sexual penetration of a person under 18, stemming from seven alleged incidents between January 1, 2023, and August 31, 2023.\n\nThe prosecution further alleges several aggravating factors. Those include that the victim was particularly vulnerable, Varoff’s conduct involved planning and sophistication and that the former teacher abused a position of trust and confidence.\n\nThe criminal complaint also states that the offenses occurred at multiple locations, including Varoff’s residence in Sacramento County and his school office in El Dorado County.\n\nVaroff will remain behind bars at the El Dorado County Jail, where he’s being held without bail. But the El Dorado County Sheriff’s Office says this remains an active and ongoing investigation.\n\nThey encourage any potential additional victims or anyone with information related to the case to contact Detective Katz by emailing katzt@eldoradosheriff.gov or calling 530-642-4716.",

    "title": "Senator demands answers after Trump accepted Rolex and gold bar before slashing tariffs on Switzerland",
    "description": "Trump’s love of lavish gifts is well known and many are displayed in the Oval Office",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is being asked to provide more information about the Rolex watch and gold bar he accepted from Swiss businessmen last year, shortly before agreeing to lower tariffs on Swiss goods, by the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nOregon Senator Ron Wyden is seeking more details to determine whether the president violated laws by accepting the gifts before cutting the deal, according to the letter seen by Bloomberg.\n\nIn November, a delegation of Swiss businessmen visited the White House to speak with Trump after he imposed a 39 percent tariff on Swiss goods. Shortly thereafter, a Rolex table clock, which does not appear to be available for purchase by the general public, appeared on the president’s desk.\n\nIn addition, a custom gold bar was displayed on the Resolute Desk, worth more than $130,000, according to Wyden’s office.\n\nLess than two weeks later, Trump announced a deal that reduced Swiss tariffs from 39 percent – the highest tariff placed on any Western country – to 15 percent. The Swiss tariffs remain at this rate.\n\nAt the time, the White House said the gifts were donations to Trump’s future presidential library, complied with U.S. and Swiss laws and were cleared by the White House legal counsel.\n\nIn his letter, Wyden wrote: “Trump’s acceptance of gifts of significant monetary value just days before lowering tariffs on goods from Switzerland creates a blatant conflict of interest and possible constitutional violations.”\n\nThe Independent has asked Senator Wyden’s office for comment.\n\nThe foreign and domestic emoluments clauses are some of the U.S.’s oldest anticorruption buffers. Under the Foreign Emoluments Clause, federal officials are prohibited from accepting a present, office, title or payment from another head of state without the consent of Congress.\n\nWyden also questioned whether Swiss negotiators informed U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer of the gifts before or after presenting them to Trump and which administration official recommended the new, lower tariff rate.\n\nThe White House pushed back on suggestions of a conflict of interest.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement: “Switzerland secured a trade deal and lower tariffs by reducing their unfair trade barriers and committing to invest billions in the United States.\n\n“The only special interest guiding President Trump’s decision-making is the best interest of the American people, and any suggestion otherwise is completely unfounded. President Trump is an extraordinarily successful businessman who can afford his own Swiss table clock.”\n\nTrump’s decision to slap a 39 percent tariff on Switzerland in August stunned the country’s officials, since the U.S. is the top export destination for Swiss goods such as pharmaceuticals, luxury watches and precious metals.\n\nWhile in Davos last week, Trump said he imposed the tariff at a higher rate because he was “rubbed the wrong way” by former Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter. Subsequently, Swiss officials reportedly struggled to convince the president to lower the tariff rate before the delegation of businessmen helped thaw tensions, according to Reuters.\n\nTrump has a well-known love for lavish, personalized gifts, which has raised questions about presidential ethics. Lawmakers and nonprofit organizations have said that the appearance of accepting such gifts leads to concerns about quid-pro-quos or giving certain countries preferential treatment as a result.\n\n“This affair also creates a perception that lavishing gifts on the President, rather than negotiating with [US Trade Representative] is the best way for trading partners to engage with the United States,” Wyden wrote.\n\nOver the last year, Trump has publicly accepted a gold crown from South Korea, a 24-karat gold and glass plaque from Apple CEO Tim Cook, the “FIFA Peace Prize” from FIFA President Gianni Infantino, a gold pager from Israel, a portrait from Russian President Vladimir Putin of the leaders together and a $400 million luxury Boeing 747 jet from Qatar to serve as the new Air Force One, before being transferred to his presidential library.",

    "description": "Growing up in the 21st century is no joke.",
    "fullText": "Zendaya is busy. Euphoria, which she produces in addition to starring in, is finally set to return for its third season on April 12, four years after our last visit to East Highland, and nearly seven since it premiered.\n\nAs frustrating as these between-season breaks can be, they leave plenty of time to explore other tales of the wild lives of high schoolers. It's all relative, though: While growing up in never a picnic, there's drama, and then there's drama. These 15 streamalikes vary widely in tone and style, but they all make clear that being a young person in the 21st century is not f*cking easy. Stream the first two seasons of Euphoria on HBO Max.\n\nKimberly (Pauline Chalamet) is an endlessly naïve scholarship student; Bela (Amrit Kaur) is an aspiring comedy writer on the make for the hottest guys; Whitney (Alyah Chanelle Scott) is an overachieving athlete and senator’s daughter;and Leighton (Reneé Rapp) is a closeted sorority girl. They're all randomly assigned to room together as freshmen at the fictional Essex College in Vermont. Created by Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble, this comedy-drama isn't nearly as salacious as its title suggests. There's sex for sure, but like Sex and the City before it, the funny, queer-friendly show is more about female friendship. Stream The Sex Lives of College Girls on HBO Max.\n\nPeriod drama is having a moment, and this one goes way, way back...to the 1990s. This British comedy-drama stars the brilliant Sharon Rooney (you might know her as Lawyer Barbie) as Rae Earl, a 16-year-old who just spent several months in a psychiatric hospital for a cocktail of mental health issues, poor body image being near the top of that list. Heading back to school, she tries to conceal the truth of her absence and ongoing challenges—with expectedly mixed results. Despite the show's comedy elements, it's about as good a narrative about growing up with serious mental health issues as you're likely to find. Rooney won a well-deserved Best Actress BAFTA for her performance. Stream My Mad Fat Diary on Prime Video, Hulu, and Tubi.\n\nThis British import feels a bit like a latter-day Skins, featuring a scholastic setting and a talented cast of young stars-in-waiting (including leads Josh Tedeku and Jodie Campbell). At the (fictional) prestigious boarding school St. Gilbert’s, five Black teens are newly attending on scholarships, but their integration into the existing cliques is less than smooth. The blend of coming-of-age drama with a willingness to take the piss when it comes to the whole \"rich private school thing\" makes this Tubi original a smashing good time. Stream Boarders on Tubi.\n\nTeen drama at its finest and most bitchy, Gossip Girl follows the many scandals of a group of young Upper East Side socialites and hangers-on. The tangled teenage lives of Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively), her best frenemy Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester), scholarship kid Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley), and plenty more pretty young boys and girls are chronicled in meticulous detail by the title's mysterious, omnipresent Gossip Girl (voiced by Kristen Bell). This one shares with Emily an impeccable sense of style, as its leads never miss a fashion beat. It all seems a bit tame when help up to Euphoria, but the show carved a path nonetheless, scandalizing parents in the mid-aughts. (The two-season 2021 follow-up is also available on HBO Max.) Stream Gossip Girl on HBO Max and Netflix.\n\nAndrea and Marco are twin brothers (both played by Mattia Carrano) with a broad circle of friends living in modern day Italy. Marco has a history of self-harm that impacted his burgeoning swimming career, while Andrea has a secret social media life,messaging men while presenting as a woman. Sexual and gender exploration is the prime mover here, but the show also deals realistically with issues like drugs and bullying and any number of other coming-of-age trials. A bit of a hidden gem. Stream Prisma on Prime Video.\n\nWith a bit of Gossip Girl’s juicy style, Elite follows a group of working-class friends who wind up with scholarships to Las Encinas, a fictional private school that is, in the show’s universe, the most exclusive in Spain. What they find there is snobbery, for sure, but also mystery, murder, and lots and lots of sex (between and among characters of various sexual orientations and numerical groupings). The smart, wonderfully trashy show ran for an almost shocking (in our modern streaming era) eight seasons, with a couple of regional remakes. Stream Elite on Netflix.\n\nThis top-tier teen drama stars Ama Qamata as Puleng Khumalo, a teenage girl who’s lived her entire life in the shadow of a sister who was taken as a baby by human traffickers (Puleng’s parents still hold a birthday celebration for the sister each year). When invited to a party by popular Fikile Bhele (Khosi Ngema), a student at an elite school in Cape Town, Puleng can’t help noticing their similarities. Steeped in the story of her sister, Puleng transfers to the school to get to the bottom of things. There’s plenty of juicy high school drama and family secrets in the mix, but the show is elevated by its unexpected dramatic heft and a multitude of queer characters and storylines. (This is ostensibly a South Africa remake of Elite, but its flavor and sense of identity are so unique that you'd hardly notice.) Stream Blood & Water on Netflix.\n\nComedian Benito Skinner plays himself, sort of, in this buzzy comedy that sees a former high school jock facing his freshman year in college while desperately trying to convince himself and everyone else that he's as straight as they come (relatable, except for the jock part). Much of the appeal is in its deft blending of tones: It's a frequently raunchy college comedy and simultaneously a sweet coming-of-age story about accepting yourself without worrying about what everyone else thinks. The cast includes Adam DiMarco (The White Lotus) and Rish Shah (Ms. Marvel) and while it definitely doesn't go as hard as Euphoria, there are moments of real drama and heartbreak. Stream Overcompensating on Prime Video.\n\nMany of us come from families with philosophies that could be described as less than sex positive. Which is not great. This popular British series imagines the life of a teenager with a parent on the opposite end of that spectrum: Mom (Gillian Anderson) is a sex therapist who’s not particularly good at romantic relationships. As a result, Asa Butterfield’s Otis Milburn grew up with an ambivalence toward the topic—a lack of interest that held until he realized that his inside knowledge of doing the deed could earn him friends (and paying customers) at school. Alongside some classmates, he establishes his own clinic to help his fellow students with their sexual concerns. In the process, Otis, and the show, address a wide range of issues, from birth control and abortion, to masturbation, sexually transmitted diseases, and developing sexual identities. Emma Mackey and Ncuti Gatwa (Doctor Who) also star. Stream Sex Education on Netflix.\n\nIndustry isn’t concerned with a power struggle among people at the top of the ladder; instead, its focus is the fight to climb said ladder. The young wannabe investment bankers it follows would all love to be the terrible rich people from that other show. The main characters come from a variety of backgrounds, but they’re all competing for a limited number of permanent positions at the fictional Pierpoint & Co., a London bank, and they’ll do anything it takes to earn their shot at the big prize. The setting here is seemingly very different from Euphoria's vague greater Los Angeles, and the whole investment banking thing hardly doesn't line up with the trials of high school, but there's a a definite vibe match, as young people face high pressure situations and fight to stay above water in a world rife with traps and temptations. Stream Industry on HBO Max.\n\nDirector Luca Guadagnino (Challengers, Queer) created this series about two American teenagers, Fraser (Jack Dylan Grazer) and Caitlin (Jordan Kristine Seamón), living with their families on a U.S. military base in Chioggia, Italy. Fraser's two moms are both in the army, but he's new to base life. Caitlin, on the other hand, has lived in Chioggia for years with her conservative father. Over the course of a summer, the two gradually bond over their mutual feelings of isolation, as well as their explorations of gender and sexuality. Stream We Are Who We Are on HBO Max.\n\nAs with many teen dramas, Baby kicks off at an elite boarding school (poor kids come of age too, ya know), but this one has a fairly wild spin: It's based (quite loosely) on a real-life Italian scandal involving teen sex workers. Benedetta Porcaroli (Immaculate) stars as Chiara, a rich kid who makes a new bestie in Ludovica (Alice Pagani), who needs money and happens to know a very sketchy guy who might be able to help her earn it. The tone is somehow less lascivious than the premise suggests, although the sex-work-as-teenage-rebellion angle is not for every taste. Stream Baby on Netflix.\n\nThere’s a lot of backstory here that you don’t really need to know to enjoy the show, but in brief, Heartbreak High is a sorta soft-reboot of a popular and long-running 1990s show in Australia, which was itself a spin-off from a 1993 movie. There’s a solid blend of teen drama (sealing with issues related to gender identity, race, and teen sexuality) and comedy (the main characters corralled into the Sexual Literacy Tutorial, with the unfortunate acronym SLT). It all starts with Amelie and Harper, two students at a diverse Sydney high school, who set off a firestorm when they create a detailed map of the sexual exploits of the student body. Stream Heartbreak High on Netflix.\n\n\"What the hell is this doing here?\" you're probably asking yourself. And, fair. But hear me out: This reimagining of the once entirely wholesome Archie comics universe is generally way over-the-top, but it tackles the trials and tribulations of growing up (including recurring storylines involving substance abuse) in a similarly...let's say \"operatic\" fashion. It veers wildly between genres, starting out by blending several coming-of-age storylines with a hot-for-teacher whodunnit: The dour, elderly Miss Grundy of the comics is younged up and is having an affair with Archie in the series opener, leading in to a bloody murder mystery. Before long, we're folding in supernatural horror and alternate universes, things made all the weirder by the way the show seems to take itself absolutely seriously in the face of one bonkers plot twist after another. It's the whackadoo comic-book version of Euphoria. Steam Riverdale on Netflix.\n\nThe popular and controversial British series launched names like Nicholas Hoult, Daniel Kaluuya, and Dev Patel while dealing with hot-button issues like mental illness, substance abuse, and bullying. The show also never forgets—not even for one episode—that it's about teenagers, and doesn't shy away from the sex lives of its large (and ever-changing) cast of characters. There's a pretty straight line to be drawn between the success of Skins and that of Euphoria. Stream Skins on Hulu.",

    "title": "Seven Products to Protect Your House From Snow and Ice Damage",
    "description": "Freezing temperatures, a blanket of snow, and accumulating ice can do a lot of damage.",
    "fullText": "When the cold weather arrives, there’s a tendency among homeowners to focus on the interior—namely, our personal comfort and the utility bills. That’s perfectly sensible—no one wants to shiver in their own house, and no one wants to be slammed with an enormous utility bill, either. But the exterior of your house is just as important.\n\nHeavy snow and icy buildup during extended periods of severe cold can really take a toll on your house. Snow and ice combined with melt/freeze cycles during sunny periods can do some serious (and often completely silent) damage to your home in a variety of ways, from water intrusion through your roof to ice-heavy tree branches crashing into the house. If you live somewhere where you can expect to be buried in snow and ice at some point this winter, here are the products you need to protect your house.\n\nSnow is heavy, and your roof is designed to handle only so much of it. The chances that your roof is going to collapse are probably pretty minimal, but that doesn’t mean letting a ton of snow and ice sit on it for weeks at a time is good for your roof or the structure under it. At the same time, climbing up onto your roof to shovel or sweep snow off is not the safest thing to do. Instead, keep a snow rake on hand. Designed to be used from the ground, a snow rake is a simple tool that lets you scrape a lot of snow off your roof safely, easing the snow load and minimizing the chances that water will infiltrate the house. Just keep in mind that if you install roof cable to prevent ice dams (see below), you’ll need to be super careful using a roof rake, as you can easily snag the cable and yank it loose.\n\nOne often-overlooked problem caused by cold, snowy weather is ice buildup in roof and furnace vents. Sewer vents on the roof and furnace vents that draw in clean air and expel exhaust from your heating system can get clogged with ice, which can cause your heat to malfunction and pose a severe health hazard if fumes build up inside the home. A sewer skewer is a simple solution. It’s just a hunk of copper, really, but copper is an excellent conductor, so it absorbs heat from the sun (and your home’s own gases as they rise up) and radiates that heat back out, melting any snow and ice that form in the vent. It’s shaped to move the melting water away from the vent so it doesn’t just drip down and re-freeze. It’s incredibly simple to install (be careful on your roof, though) and can save you from disaster.\n\nIce dams are layers of ice that form at the edge of your roof, preventing proper drainage. Unchecked, ice dams can really do a number on your roof and even the structure of your house. Preventing ice dams can be relatively easy, however—just install some heated roof cables. Attached to the edge of your roof in a zig-zag pattern, roof cables ensure that ice dams can’t form, and melting snow and ice can drain properly into your gutters.\n\nA common way ice and freezing temperatures can damage your house is through exterior faucets and spigots. Because they extend outside the insulated interior of the house, they’re very susceptible to freezing, and that ice can make its way into the pipe behind it, leading to a burst pipe and a very expensive problem. The solution, though, is not expensive—for about $11, a faucet cover will keep your exterior faucets ice-free and water safely inside your pipes where it belongs. Affix one to every exposed faucet or spigot around the house and you’ll have one less thing to worry about.\n\nIf you have trees near your home, heavy ice and snow can snap off branches, which then smack into your roof or walls—and those ice-laden branches will be heavy when they hit your house. Being a little proactive and trimming back branches—especially old, dead ones—is the best way to prevent that from happening. If you don’t want to call a professional to trim back a few branches, pick up a mini-chainsaw to get the job done. If your branches are a little more than a mini can handle, a full-size chainsaw might be needed—but be sure you know how to handle it, especially if you’re going to be climbing a ladder to use it.\n\nLike ice dams on your roof, your gutters can become clogged with snow and ice, preventing proper drainage and leading to rot and water intrusion. Gutter heaters are an easy solution that prevents ice and snow buildup, ensuring everything drains away from your roof and your house as intended.\n\nThe freeze/melt cycle can be particularly hard on your hardscapes, including driveways and patios. Meltwater gets into small cracks and then freezes, expanding and widening those cracks. After a while, your pavement or asphalt is chewed up and needs replacing. You can do a few things to prevent (or at least slow down) this destruction. Filling cracks in asphalt or concrete as they form with a filler sealer means water can’t get into them in the first place. And sealing your asphalt or concrete surfaces will protect them during those weeks when ice is sitting there, melting and freezing over and over again as temperatures fluctuate.",

    "title": "How YouTube Is Fighting Back Against AI Slop",
    "description": "If you're noticing less AI in your feeds, that's by design.",
    "fullText": "Science fiction and science leaders alike have warned us that artificial intelligence may one day take over the world, but until those predictions come to pass, generative AI's biggest impact on my life has been overloading my social media feeds with slop. It seems I can't open TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube without running smack into bizarre and troubling AI concoctions featuring babies in danger and cats having affairs. It really is the wild west (or maybe Westworld) out there.\n\nI think few among us really believe these videos are any good, and it's pretty obvious they aren't good for us, or for the world. Short-form video is already numbing enough, but this AI content is generally completely devoid of any meaning or substance. And yet, it's everywhere. I haven't spent too much time on YouTube Shorts recently, but in my limited experience, the feed has been chock full of AI, especially if I'm logged out of my personal account.\n\nStill, if you're a dedicated YouTube Shorts user (or a frequent YouTube user in general) you might have noticed something odd in recent days: There don't seem to be quite as many AI videos on the platform right now. There are still a lot, don't get me wrong, but it turns out YouTube has recently taken action to remove some of its AI content—the sloppiest of the slop.\n\nAndroid Police spotted the development on Wednesday, basing its findings on a November report from Kapwing, a company that develops an online video editor. Kapwing investigated AI slop across YouTube's vast content library, noting the top 100 most-subscribed YouTube channels that publish this sort of AI content. In the two months since that report, Android Police noticed that 16 of those 100 channels are no longer with us.\n\nThat includes the most popular AI channel on YouTube, at least according to Kapwing. \"CuentosFacianantes\" had 5.95 million subscribers at the time of their initial report, and produced AI-generated shorts inspired by Dragon Ball. The channel had amassed roughly 1.28 billion views by the end of last year; despite launching in 2020, it had curated its library to begin Jan. 8, 2025, so those numbers were racked up pretty recently. The number two channel, \"Imperio de Jesus\" with 5.87 million subscribers, and the number seven channel \"Super Cat League,\" with 4.21 million subscribers, were also shut down.\n\nAccording to Android Police, the 16 channels in question had a total of 35 million subscribers and over 4.7 billion views across their collective videos. Some of these channels are completely gone, while others simply have had their videos removed.\n\nYouTube CEO Neal Mohan published a post on Jan. 21 of this year describing the company's vision for 2026. Towards the end of that letter, he acknowledges AI content, predicting that, \"AI will be a boon to the creatives who are ready to lean in,\" and comparing it to tools like Photoshop and CGI, adding \"AI will remain a tool for expression, not a replacement.\" However, Mohan was also critical of the technology, noting that it's becoming more difficult to tell real videos from AI. He notes that YouTube is now removing \"any harmful synthetic media that violates our Community Guidelines,\" and is giving creators tools to help identify and block deepfakes.\n\nMore interestingly, the letter includes a section labeled \"Managing AI slop,\" which is the first time I've seen a company like YouTube use that expression. Mohan says that YouTube's goal is to be a place where free expression thrives, but also a place \"where people feel good spending their time.\" To that point, he says, \"To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we’re actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content.\"\n\nMohan doesn't call out any accounts by name, nor does he acknowledge the accounts and content the company has already deleted, but it's a clear line in the sand: YouTube is not against AI-generated content, but it will remove low-quality AI content it feels is, well, slop. That's good news for anyone who uses YouTube (so, pretty much everyone), even if it's far from a cure for the growing problem.\n\nI've reached out to YouTube for comment on this story, and will update this piece if I hear back.",

    "title": "You Can Now Start a Group Chat in Spotify's DMs (for Some Reason)",
    "description": "It's still wild that Spotify has DMs at all.",
    "fullText": "If you and your friends have the same taste in music, you probably text each other what you're listening to. I know when I stumble upon a new discovery I love—or even something I think is trash—I fire it off to the group chat to talk about it. Of course, I just forward the song to the group chat in the Messages app, like any other thing I'd want to send to that group. If you have Spotify, however, you have a new group chat option to choose from: Spotify itself.\n\nSpotify heads might already know that the app has had a messaging feature since August. While the point of the feature is to send Spotify content to your friends, it's a basic messaging service, which means you can send any text you want—including emojis. It's available to any Spotify user, whether you have Premium or just a free account, so long as you're 16 or older. None of that is new today.\n\nWhat is new today is the amount of people you can text at once in Spotify. Since August, chats have been limited to one-on-one interactions. Now, you're able to add up to nine other people at once to a thread. That means 10-person group chats to talk about new music, podcasts, audiobooks, or, of course, anything at all—assuming you actually want to move your DMs to Spotify.\n\nTo start, open Spotify on mobile (this isn't supported on desktop at this time) then tap your profile in the top right corner. Look for \"Messages\" at the bottom of this menu, then choose \"New Message.\" If this is your first time interacting with people on Spotify, you'll need to invite others to chat before you can craft a new message. Here, you'll have the choice to share a link to invite a friend to join your message. You can also find this option from the share menu on any piece of Spotify content, and hitting the \"Invite friends\" option.\n\nOnce you've initiated a message, you'll be able to start crafting new ones—including group chats. Head back to this Messages menu—or hit the share button on a song, podcast, or audiobook—then choose \"Create group.\" Here, tap any friends from the suggestions you'd like to add, then choose \"Create group\" again to finalize the chat. Spotify says the people that appear in the list of suggestions are those you have shared content to before, created a playlist or Blend with previously, were in a \"recent\" Jam together, or are on an active Family or Duo plan. If they don't appear, you can always choose the invite option to reach out directly.\n\nWhoever creates the group is officially its admin. As the admin, you have the power to add or remove anyone from the group chat. If you're in the group chat, you're labeled as a \"Participant.\" Invited members are labeled \"Pending.\" The admin as well as any participants are allowed to block any group chat user for any reason.\n\nThe issue is, do you really want to dedicate a group chat to Spotify itself? Maybe if this feature rolled out when the app launched way back when, it'd be different. But people are set in their ways: It's so hard to get people to move chat apps, especially when it's for one specific purpose. Rather than open yet another thread to keep track of, I think I'd rather just text links to my main group chat—and I'm guessing the other members of the chat would agree.\n\nIf you don't want to use Spotify's messaging service at all, you can leave it behind, and save yourself from getting added to all future group and one-on-one chats. To do so, tap your profile, choose \"Settings and privacy,\" then hit \"Privacy and social.\" Here, scroll down to \"Social features\" and turn off \"Messages.\"",

    "description": "\"The point is, go to the doctors for a check-up or if something is not right. It might save your life.\"",
    "fullText": "\"Last year, after four years of hell, some new extreme symptoms popped up, like shortness of breath and joint pain. A few exams and lots more bloodwork later — wham, bam, thank you ma'am — it was undiagnosed LUPUS this whole time. I've now been on treatment for four months. Always, always, ALWAYS listen to your body above anyone else!\"\n\n\"When I couldn't step out of the shower without completely losing my breath, I finally went to the ER. I was diagnosed with what the docs called the largest deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in my thigh) they had ever seen. A piece of it had migrated to my lung, creating a huge saddle pulmonary embolism.\n\nI spent four days in the ICU and underwent two separate stent procedures to get the clots dissolved. Took about six months to get back to full capacity.\n\nIn my defense, I didn't know leg pain was a symptom of a blood clot, but I shouldn't have let it go on for so long.\"\n\n\"Also can be a sign of kidney disease.\"\n\n\"Ignored this for over two years and eventually ended up in the hospital with kidney failure.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 57, Female, California\n\n—Anonymous, 20, Nonbinary, North Carolina\n\n\"I went to the emergency room the week before I was supposed to return to work from maternity leave. The ER doctor told me my blood pressure was up, but to just go to my primary and sent me on my way. I made an appointment with my primary, and she told me I went through a lot having a baby, and my body is just adjusting.\"\n\n\"I spent three days in the hospital being treated as my heart was only at 15% functionality. My poor husband was distraught, he almost lost his partner, and was sad because he couldn't spend the days with me, instead having to care for my infant. It was scary. Thankfully, I have recovered, but I will spend the rest of my life taking lots of medicine to keep my heart healthy. What I learned is to listen to your body. If something feels wrong, it very well may be, and losing your life isn't worth being afraid to go to the doctor.\"\n\n\"By the time he was willing to share this with me, and we went to a doctor who treated his illness, my husband had between 6-18 months left to live. He delayed his treatment because he thought his 'persona' would be destroyed. He became more verbal and the loving man I recalled after taking his medication. He was a better man… until he was no longer alive. He died at 67. Men, check your PSA count. Save your lives not only for yourselves, but also for those who love you.\"\n\n\"Turns out I was so severely anemic, the breathlessness and coughing weren't from asthma or bronchitis or allergies, but it was from severe anemia for many years, indicating possible heart failure. After an iron supplement and an IUD to slow heavy menstrual bleeding, I haven't had to use an inhaler or asthma medicine in almost seven years. Get your iron levels checked often if you are a female in your 30s and 40s; it can literally make your heart fail.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 47, Female, North Carolina\n\n\"The poor ER doctor lady was so nice, but I was so embarrassed. Like, she literally stuck her hand up my ass. I genuinely felt like I was in John Mulaney's skit about trying to get Xanax and ending up getting a prostate exam because he said he was lying to get prescribed drugs. Unfortunately, because I waited, it's mostly pain management now. Pay attention to rectal issues and eat your fiber! I wanna die writing this. I'm so glad it's anon.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 25, Female, Seattle, Washington\n\n\"Two surgeries, a long hospital stay, followed by a home nurse aid daily to administer intravenous antibiotics and clean the 3-inch section of flesh removed, which had to remain open for weeks for the tendons to heal. You could see my bone and all the other inside things. I have a wicked scar from it.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 63, Female, New Jersey\n\n\"I had open heart surgery soon after, and they were able to remove it. I'll be on medication forever and need to see a specialist twice a year. Had my wife not told me to go to the doctors, I'd be dead by now. This is definitely the short version of my story, but the point is, go to the doctors for a check-up or if something is not right. It might save your life.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 42, Male, Atlanta, Georgia\n\n\"Right before my 33rd birthday, my father passed, and a month before, I had gotten a divorce. So when my period came on and didn't stop after 15 days, I figured maybe my hormones were messed up since I was going through a lot emotionally. I didn't think too much about it — it'll stop eventually, I told myself. That was June of 2025; by August, I was still bleeding. It never stopped. I finally dragged myself into the doctor's office. I was in pain, I was anemic, and I showed up with photos where it looked like I was passing pure flesh the size of my hand. Something had to give.\"\n\n\"I finally got my second opinion four months later. I have endometrial cancer, and I am going to have a total hysterectomy at 33 years old next week. I'm not happy, but it's easier to process knowing what the problem is. And I can't help but wonder if someone had listened to me for all the years I was complaining, if maybe there could have been a treatment for my endometriosis before it turned cancerous.\n\nSo no, a normal cycle should not be 10-15 days per month. No, you should not feel like you are giving birth every month (cramping is normal, but it should not be so severe that you can't walk). If you are bleeding so much you have to resort to wearing a diaper — that's not normal. And if the doctor won't listen to you, make them. Don't wait until you are so anemic you need a transfusion (also not normal), and if you have every single symptom and they tell you the imaging is normal — make them get you a second opinion. Being a woman is hard, but it doesn't mean suffering in silence. Speak up.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 33, Female, Alabama\n\nAlso in Goodful: If You Can Complete More Than 15 Of These Common Phrases, Your Vocabulary Is Better Than 95% Of People’s\n\nAlso in Goodful: \"I Knew Instantly That He Would Be Dead Soon\": Doctors Are Sharing The Biggest Health Issues Patients Ignored Until It Was Too Late, And Whew, I've Been Warned\n\nAlso in Goodful: My Husband And I Separated.

    "fullText": "The first Aston Martin to be designed under the leadership of eminent designer Adrian Newey has appeared in pre-season testing.\n\nThe car's debut had been delayed - although the team have not explained why - but Aston Martin managed to get the AMR26 out for the final hour of running at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on Thursday.\n\nLance Stroll managed only four slow laps before stopping on track, with Aston Martin saying the move was \"precautionary\".\n\nHowever, the car's design has already caught attention.\n\nRunning in an all-black camouflage livery, its nose, side pods and engine cover were clearly different from those that had appeared on most cars so far.\n\nThe test is being held in private and no independent media are permitted.\n\nBut from the few photographs Aston Martin have published, the nose appears wider than the norm on cars designed to the new 2026 rules - with a shape perhaps reminiscent of a duck's bill.\n\nThe side pods are very thin and heavily undercut, the front suspension mounting points are very high on the chassis and the engine cover is heavily cut away.\n\nThe car only arrived in Spain on Wednesday and the team spent most of the day preparing it.\n\nStroll said: \"It was a long day for all the mechanics and everyone in the team pushing flat out to get the car ready.\n\n\"We got a few laps in at the end of the day and it was feeling good. We have to learn the car and understand its strengths and weaknesses.\"\n\nLead driver Fernando Alonso is due in the car on Friday - the fifth and final day of this week's testing.\n\nNewey's cars have won 14 drivers' championships and 12 constructors' titles since 1991 across the Williams, McLaren and Red Bull teams.\n\nHe joined Aston Martin in March last year and has been working on the new 2026 car ever since.\n\nF1 has changed its regulations this year and the chassis, engines, tyres and fuels are all new. Aston Martin have become the factory team of Honda, who have spent the past six years with Newey's former team Red Bull.",

    "description": "Why former England and Chelsea coach Steve Holland could be the key appointment in new boss Michael Carrick's coaching team at Manchester United.",
    "fullText": "Ask people who know Steve Holland well how they would describe the former Chelsea and England coach and the same phrase is repeated.\n\n\"Football is his life,\" a source told BBC Sport. \"Whether it's Champions League, thoughts on players or something else, he has a hell of a brain when it comes to football detail.\"\n\nIt explains why, instead of sitting back and reflecting on the success of Manchester United's 3-2 win at Arsenal, Holland spent the return journey to North West England going through footage of the victory with head coach Michael Carrick and the rest of his backroom team to come up with a plan for Sunday's home game against Fulham.\n\nOn Monday, while the players were given a day off, Holland and company were at United's Carrington training ground, honing the sessions they hope will lead to a third straight Premier League win.\n\nAttention to detail is a Holland character trait, something he has relied on since joining Crewe in 1992, after concluding he would advance further as a coach than he did as a player if he dedicated himself to the profession at a young age.\n\nHolland, 55, believes only former England boss Graham Taylor was younger than him when he gained what is now known as the Uefa A Licence coaching badge, when he was 21.\n\nOf the rest of United's new coaching set-up, boss Carrick had not even started secondary school when Holland began his coaching journey. Jonathan Woodgate is slightly older than Carrick. Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion are younger.\n\nIt is why Holland's presence - and, through his England experience, ability to deal with intense pressure - is so vital to Carrick and his coaching team and why he is getting so much credit for the positive start to a tenure that has already delivered victories against Manchester City and Arsenal and taken United up to fourth in the Premier League.\n\n\"He won't be bothered about the scrutiny and pressure at Manchester United,\" says former Radio Stoke editor Graham McGarry, who got to know Holland well during his 16-year stint with Crewe.\n\n\"He will take it all in his stride and just do his job.\n\n\"His training sessions are fantastic. You can already see the Manchester United players are responding to them.\"\n\nNot that Holland is likely to be talking about it in public.\n\nA second trait that keeps being noted is that he is a man of few words, someone who is difficult to read. \"You never knew whether he was quietly content or silently raging,\" said a source who has worked with him.\n\nBut that mask can help when it comes to delivering messaging. The less someone speaks, the argument goes, the more likely their audience is to listen when something is being said.\n\nIt is far too early to assess Holland's work. It is just over two weeks since the coaching team were introduced to United's players as a group for the first time, but several well-placed sources stress the coaching team work as a collective.\n\nIt should not be dismissed either that while Darren Fletcher didn't win his two games in interim charge, he reset the formation following Ruben Amorim's dismissal on 5 January. The Scot began to lift the mood. He also recalled Kobbie Mainoo. It meant key players Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo returned from the Africa Cup of Nations to a stable environment, which gave Carrick the best chance of success.\n\nChanges to the training programme have been made, according to sources. The days are now shorter, but more intense. There is a different energy about sessions and more focus on individual work with specific players. The matchday routine for home games has been tweaked so players now arrive at Old Trafford slightly closer to kick-off.\n\nCarrick was given the job ahead of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, in part, because of the work he does 'on the grass'. But Holland ran the sessions with England, allowing Gareth Southgate to take an overview.\n\nIn consultation with Southgate, Holland concluded England's formation had been 'too stodgy' in qualification for the 2018 World Cup, triggering the switch to a back three. \"Harry Maguire's ability on the was ball fundamental,\" explained Holland in a half-hour dissection of his work for the Coaches Voice podcast in 2021.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports before the Manchester City game, Maguire recalled his own dealings with Holland.\n\n\"He was magnificent for England,\" he said. \"We all knew what we were doing.\n\n\"I can remember a lot of time working with Steve and he really does drill in tactically how to defend and how to keep the ball out of the back of the net.\n\n\"It's basics but really disciplined basics. I feel he will have a big part to play in making our defensive record a lot better.\"\n\nSince leaving his role with England following Euro 2022, Holland has had a short, unsuccessful spell in Japan and undertook some work for the League Managers' Association.\n\nWhat he has not done is court media attention.\n\nThe Coaches Voice chats and others with the Football Association are rare examples of Holland being interviewed.\n\n\"The perfect number two,\" as he has been described.\n\nThe insight that does exist is revealing.\n\n\"With any session the more the players are enjoying their work the more you will get out of them,\" he explained in an interview published by the FA.\n\n\"It is important to try to find creative ways of delivering repetitive practice to stimulate the players' interest.\n\n\"The key always with practice is the transfer into the game. It is important to try and maximise the possibility of a transfer by not steering too far from the reality of the game.\"\n\nHe may be new to Manchester United but navigating the fall-out from a departing boss is something Holland has plenty of experience of.\n\nIt was then Blues manager Andre Villas-Boas who elevated him from the youth ranks to the senior team at Chelsea. \"I was on holiday in Spain,\" recalled Holland. \"I took the call on day two and returned home on day three. My wife still reminds me of that regularly.\"\n\nVillas-Boas was sacked after nine months back in 2012. His successor, Roberto di Matteo, won the Champions League but was dumped after eight.\n\nBehind the scenes, Holland was impressing. He survived the tenures of Rafael Benitez, Jose Mourinho and Guus Hiddink before quitting to concentrate solely on England after Chelsea won the Premier League in Antonio Conte's first season in charge.\n\n\"At a big club, every day is a drama,\" Holland told the Coaches Voice. \"It is never quite as bad as it is made out to be but your ability to handle these moments are decisive.\n\n\"My experience of life at Chelsea has taught me it is about winning. That winning mentality doesn't include feeling sorry for yourself or making excuses. It means you analyse and push to do better next time.\"\n\nThey seem like wise words given the intensity of the noise that surrounds Manchester United, who will look to add more weight to claims their revival under Carrick and co is more than a flash in the pan when they host Fulham in the Premier League on Sunday.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, it seems Holland is already having a significant positive impact at English football's fallen giants.\n\nThe job might be tough, and the demands might be high, but it is fair to assume the Stockport-born 'football obsessive' is in his element.",

    "fullText": "An octopus species native to the U.K. had a major resurgence in 2025. According to The Guardian, its record numbers excited experts.\n\nThe common or Mediterranean octopus is prospering again in the waters off England's south coast from Cornwall to Devon. Matt Slater, a marine conservation officer at Cornwall Wildlife Trust, told The Guardian the local fishermen's catch was 13 times more than expected in Cornwall. It totaled approximately 233,000 octopuses.\n\nThe numbers were so impressive, the Wildlife Trusts dubbed 2025 \"the year of the octopus.\"\n\nThe species is native to the U.K. but is typically seen in smaller numbers. A milder winter combined with a warm breeding season in the spring created conditions that were ideal for the population boom. The last time that amount of octopuses was present in the region was in 1950.\n\nExperts expect an equally large number of the species for 2026 but predict it will drop off afterwards, following previous patterns.\n\nSlater told the outlet, \"It is unlikely, based on past events, that it will go on for a long time. But the sea keeps giving us surprises at the moment so it's quite an unpredictable situation.\"\n\nOctopuses are a valuable part of the marine ecosystem, consuming crabs, crayfish, and mollusks, helping to keep those populations in check. The common octopus is also noted as one of the most intelligent invertebrates in the ocean. It's able to thwart attacks in unique ways and camouflage itself almost perfectly, per National Geographic.\n\nThere is some concern from experts that the octopus \"bloom\" could impact other kinds of fishing. The U.K.'s Marine Management Organisation has said that crab catching numbers are down. But lobster, crawfish, and scallops have all remained stable.\n\nOctopuses have been popping up unexpectedly in other locations as well. The remains of an octopus washed up on the shores of Aberdeenshire, Scotland, and were taken by scientists for additional study. And a filmmaker diving in the waters around British Columbia received a \"gentle hug\" from an octopus while filming underwater.\n\nShould we be harnessing the ocean to power our homes?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

Coleman declined to participate in the investigation, WFAA previously reported.\n\nFollowing that arrest, Richardson posted a series of Instagram stories saying she had been reflecting on her actions and working to move forward in a positive way.

    "description": "A third of Americans will learn the hard way about Social Security. That’s according to finance guru, Dave Ramsey, who warns that Social Security alone is insufficient, and instead recommends maxing out 401(k) and IRA savings. By 2034, he says, Social Security’s reserves are expected to run out of money if nothing changes. “Depending on ... Dave Ramsey Warns That A Third of Americans Will Learn The Hard Way About Social Security",
    "fullText": "Social Security reserves are expected to deplete by 2034 without policy changes.\n\nSaving 15% of an $80,000 salary builds over $1.5M by 65.\n\nMaximizing employer 401(k) matches captures free money for retirement.\n\nInvestors rethink 'hands off' investing and decide to start making real money\n\nA third of Americans will learn the hard way about Social Security.\n\nThat’s according to finance guru, Dave Ramsey, who warns that Social Security alone is insufficient, and instead recommends maxing out 401(k) and IRA savings.\n\nBottom line – we can’t count on the government to take care of us in retirement. And to be honest, you don’t want to put your retirement hopes and dreams in the hands of the government. Look, if you get benefits when you retire, that’s great. But if your goal is to make Social Security your key source of income, you really are setting yourself up for disaster.\n\nAt the moment, more than four million Americans are turning 65 between now and 2027. “That’s over 11,000 people hitting this milestone every single day. The program's cash surplus is expected to run out in less than a decade,” according to NPR.\n\nThat also means that when more people go to retire, they’ll be met with limited resources from Social Security. With that being the case, many of us need to figure out how to make the most of our finances to have a safe, healthy retirement.\n\nMax out your contributions to retirement accounts if you can.\n\nAccounts with tax advantages – 401(k)s, IRAs, health savings accounts, etc. – are great ways to save and invest for the future. In many cases, contributions to these accounts can help cut your taxable income for the 2025 tax season. You have until April 15, 2026, to contribute the maximum amount for it to apply to your 2025 taxes.\n\nAlso, if your employer offers a match program, contribute enough to receive the highest employer match possible. You can also max out your health savings account if you have one. Let's say your employer will match up to 6% of your salary; maximize that.\n\nConsider this. Let’s say you earn $100,000 a year and that your employer will match 50% of your contributions up to 5% of your salary or $5,000. With your contribution and the employer match, $7,500 is saved every year. Over 30 to 40 years of that, you’ll have a solid balance.",

    "description": "Gold and silver futures tumbled alongside a selloff in the stock market Thursday.",
    "fullText": "Gold (GC=F) hovered near $5,400 after falling from a high north of $5,600 per ounce on Thursday while silver (SI=F) steadied after a choppy session as the precious-metals rally paused.\n\nThe volatility came alongside a wider sell-off in the stock market on Thursday with tech declining following Microsoft's (MSFT) quarterly results. The rapid rally in precious metals faced resistance as the US dollar (DX-Y.NYB) rebounded from its lowest level since early 2022.\n\nHow is US dollar strength affecting precious metals?\n\nWhat caused gold and silver prices to pull back?\n\nWhy are precious metals experiencing increased volatility?\n\nWhat are analysts' current gold price targets?\n\n“The continued surge across metals, especially gold and silver, is entering a dangerous phase, in my opinion,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said on Thursday.\n\n“The problem is volatility feeding on itself. As price swings intensify, liquidity thins,” he added.\n\nGold prices had risen roughly 20% year to date as the greenback weakened against other currencies.\n\nJust last week, Goldman Sachs analysts set a year-end price target of $5,400 for gold, with a potential upside risk due to increased participation from private-sector investors.\n\nThe precious metal rallied past $5,500 on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve held rates steady, with commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell doing little to stop the dollar's slide.\n\n“I see this as a sign that conviction levels in the Dollar-down trade are high,” Robin Brooks, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote in a note on Thursday before gold's descent. He noted that \"the weak Dollar is super-charging the debasement trade.”\n\nSilver topped $120 per ounce before paring gains on Thursday. The precious metal is up roughly 50% year to date, following a stunning rally in 2025.\n\n\"Silver prices have already significantly overshot our forecasted averages, though calling a top is close to impossible in markets displaying near-parabolic price momentum,\" JPMorgan analysts noted earlier this month.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.
