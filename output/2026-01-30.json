    "fullText": "Lazio are moving quickly to reshape their defence, with Alessio Romagnoli’s departure paving the way for a new arrival.\n\nAfter days of uncertainty, the signs now point clearly toward Romagnoli leaving the club, with reports via FiorentinaNews.\n\nHis exclusion from the squad for the latest match has been widely interpreted as the final step before a transfer to Al-Sadd in Qatar.\n\nLECCE, ITALY – JANUARY 24: Alessio Romagnoli after the Serie A match between US Lecce and SS Lazio at Stadio Via del Mare on January 24, 2026 in Lecce, Italy. (Photo by Marco Rosi – Getty Images)\n\nThe experienced centre-back is expected to complete the move imminently, bringing an end to his time in Rome.\n\nWith that exit in motion, Lazio have already lined up a replacement.\n\nDiogo Leite of Union Berlin has emerged as the leading candidate to step into the back line, and negotiations are understood to be at an advanced stage.\n\nThe Portuguese defender has been on the club’s radar for some time, and the current deal is reported to be worth around €2.5m.\n\nBERLIN, GERMANY – NOVEMBER 04: Diogo Leite of 1. FC Union Berlin in action during the Bundesliga match between 1. FC Union Berlin and Eintracht Frankfurt at An der Alten Foersterei on November 04, 2023 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo by Luciano Lima/Getty Images)\n\nLeite, 27, offers a different profile to Romagnoli, more mobile and comfortable defending higher up the pitch, qualities that could suit Maurizio Sarri’s system.\n\nLazio’s strategy appears clear: balance the books with outgoing deals while reinvesting carefully in younger, adaptable players.\n\nIf final details are completed as expected, Leite will arrive as Romagnoli’s direct replacement, marking the start of a new chapter in Lazio’s defensive unit.",

    "description": "FC Bayern wants to sell Sacha Boey.",
    "fullText": "According to a report from Sport Bild journalists Christian Falk and Tobi Altschäffl (as captured by @iMiaSanMia), Bayern Munich right-back Sacha Boey rejected an offer from Olympique Lyon — along with proposals from several other clubs in the Premier League.\n\nBoey seems incredulous to the fact that he has little-to-no hope of actually getting significant playing time in Bavaria. In fact, he might actually be welcoming the chance to get paid to work out and watch games (Author’s Note: Admittedly, that sounds like an awesome job). Yes, Bayern Munich fans, Boey is going #FullBounaSarr:\n\nSacha Boey has rejected an offer from Olympique Lyon. The Frenchman has also rebuffed inquiries from the Premier League. Bayern were not amused because they would have liked to sell Boey this month. Boey earns around €3m fixed per year at Bayern and is happy to stay despite his limited role.\n\nMoreover, Boey appears to have irritated his agents (well, now former agents) as well (per @iMiaSanMia_GER):\n\nBoey has changed his management for this, he is now with Moussa Sissoko, the agent of Dayot Upamecano. His old management CAA Stellar was also somewhat annoyed with Boey.\n\nCapology reports that Boey’s total financial package actually is higher at €5,900,000 (€4,720,000 salary + €1,180,000 bonus), which makes this an even more swift kick in the junk for the Bavarians to absorb.\n\nBayern Munich has made dozens of astute pickups near the transfer deadline over the years, but when the Bavarians see a French right-back available in the waning hours of a transfer window, they just can’t help themselves and enter into “Charlie Brown Football Mode”:\n\nBoey, who has not really had a significant performance since joining Bayern Munich in 2024, is now Bouna Sarr 2.0…it happened again!\n\nWe have talked about great cover songs many times here and, as it turns out, I was in the mood for a good cover this week, so I leaned over to the 90s for Social Distortion’s “Ring of Fire.”\n\nReleased in 1990, it is vintage Social D. Enjoy:\n\nFor good measure, here is Johnny Cash’s legendary original:\n\nThis is really not related to anything about, but it was a cool little clip of Ozzy Osbourne that I thought some of you out there might enjoy:\n\nOzzy’s priceless reaction to hearing Mac Sabbath for the first time pic.twitter.com/qpLNKpG0TE\n\n— 🎸 Rock History 🎸 (@historyrock_) January 24, 2026\n\nThis episode was much more fluid and better than the premiere. However, the writers and showrunners really do need to stop it with the unnecessary attempts to get interest. In the first episode, it was projecting pooping and in the second episode, viewers were “treated” to dangling prosthetic dong for absolutely no reason. Again, I like childish humor or even edgy humor as much as the next person, but these just seemed like weak attempts to shock the viewer. Just let the story do the talking because this episode was actually good.\n\nWe got our first look at the jousting, which was cool and the relationship between Dunk and Egg is definitely rounding into form with some good banter.\n\nThe plot is still a bit slow as the show seems to suffer from some of what has felled House of the Dragon. That said, it was entertaining enough to keep the viewer’s interest.\n\nThe interaction with the Targaryens was actually a pretty fascinating scene and gave the show some much needed depth.\n\nOverall, this episode represented progress from both a storyline and a show standpoint. It is too early to say if this can evolve into being great, but it took a nice, little step forward — and we’ll take it.\n\nIf you were wondering what the overall plan for this series is, well, let’s just say that the showrunner is being a wee bit ambitious:\n\n‘A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms’ showrunner Ira Parker says his goal with the series is to follow Dunk and Egg's entire lives ⚔️\n\n• 4–5 seasons with Egg as a child\n\n• Return 10 years later for 4–5 seasons with Egg as a prince\n\n• Return another decade later for 4–5 seasons with… pic.twitter.com/sTot5qwct7\n\n— Culture Crave 🍿 (@CultureCrave) January 29, 2026\n\nI actually had no intention on reviewing this, but since it had been so acclaimed (Oscar consideration for Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson?), I figured I should check it out when I came across it on HBO. I had heard great things about the 2002 documentary, but had never seen it (I really wish I had before I saw the movie).\n\nAs someone who was an MMA fan in this period, I knew of Mark Kerr and the main fighters in the story, but I have to say…the movie was bad.\n\nI understand what they were going for, but I found the actual, real fighters who appeared in the film like Bas Rutten and Ryan Bader (who played Mark Coleman) to be better in the film than The Rock. At times, Bader was a little stiff, but he’s not really an actor, so that was to be expected. The Rock, however, was not good in this role.\n\nTo be honest, I don’t know what else I was expecting. The way the movie was presented, it really did not give any kind of proper ending. It seemed like it was going for the same vibes as The Iron Claw, but it was just missing something — and it is hard to pinpoint exactly what that was.\n\nAt times, it was hard to figure out if you should even care about the characters. Was I supposed to feel bad for them? Emily Blunt’s character (Dawn Staples) was…the worst. Just an awful character/person.\n\nThe funny thing is, I’m not even writing this to be a jerk, but I just didn’t get it…any of it…and I was a fan of this era of MMA. It just was not interesting. I didn’t feel like I learned anything or that I got some unique insight.\n\nMaybe I am just more fickle now or maybe I just am more cognizant of how I spend my time, but this movie just did not hit for me. I’d love to hear what any of you, who saw it, think.\n\nYes, the title is exactly what you think it means, but the cast on this HBO limited series looks awesome (Jason Bateman, David Harbour), so I will likely put it on my watch list. How about you? Here is the trailer:\n\nThe official trailer for ‘DTF ST. LOUIS’ starring Jason Bateman, David Harbour and Linda Cardellini has been released. \n\nPremiering March 1 on HBO Max.\n pic.twitter.com/O4754JuZob\n\n— Film Updates (@FilmUpdates) January 28, 2026\n\nBayern Munich will be looking to build off of its performance against PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League, while also attempting to bounce-back in the Bundesliga after a disappointing 2-1 loss to FC Augsburg last weekend.\n\nBeing head-and-shoulder above your opponent does not always guarantee a win (see last weekend), but the Bavarians are just too strong for Hamburger SV.\n\nPrediction: Hamburger SV 0-5 Bayern Munich\n\nEintracht Frankfurt 2-2 Bayer Leverkusen\n\nWerder Bremen 1-2 Borussia Mönchengladbach\n\nBorussia Dortmund 3-0 Heidenheim\n\nBundesliga Last Matchday: 8-3 (includes two makeup games)\n\nWorld Cup Qualifiers/Friendlies: 99-45\n\nFranz Beckenbauer Supercup: 1-0\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "description": "The Wolverines make the short trip to East Lansing to take on the Spartans in a renewal of one of the sport’s rivalries.",
    "fullText": "The Big Ten is home to a few of college basketball’s great rivalries and Friday’s lone conference game is perhaps the most important rivalry matchup in the conference this season.\n\nMichigan and Michigan State are two of the very best teams in the country, with the Wolverines led by a rising star in Dusty May and the Spartans by the ever-resolute Tom Izzo, one of the greatest coaches in the history of the sport.\n\nTime/TV channel: 8 p.m. ET on FOX\n\nMichigan’s march through the 2025-26 season has carried an air of inevitability. The Wolverines have blown out bottom feeders and fellow contenders alike in their run to a 19-1 record with a lone head scratcher of a blemish in a loss to Wisconsin at home.\n\nMichigan State has quietly done much of the same. The Spartans’ two losses are thoroughly understandable, coming against Duke and Nebraska (imagine that sentence a few years ago). They were on a run of blowouts in their own right before a head scratcher of a close road game against a lowly Rutgers team that ended in an overtime win.\n\nThese teams know defense, with Michigan’s ranking second and Michigan State’s ranking first, both nationally, in KenPom’s efficiency metrics. The problem becomes apparent on the other end of the court where the Wolverines’ offense ranks in at 10th nationally while the Spartans sit all the way down at 43rd.\n\nBoth groups play tremendous defense, but Michigan does a better job of scoring the basketball. The Wolverines play a balanced brand of ball that keeps everyone involved with isolation mixed in. Yaxel Lendeborg is the star, but even if you slow him down you have to contend with Elliot Cadeau, Morez Johnson and Aday Mara, among others.\n\nMichigan State’s offense is more reliant on Jeremy Fears as a distributor, which isn’t at all a bad thing. Fears has established himself as one of the sport’s premier floor generals this season with a sky high assist rate of 51.6%. The Spartans aren’t as talented as several other top teams, including the Wolverines, but they have experience and a rising star of a point guard that knows where to put the ball and when.\n\nI’d expect May’s group to key in on trying to mitigate Fears’ impact directly on the ball or force him out of passing situations by stifling the Spartans’ frontcourt off of it. The path is less clear for Izzo’s crew, which has to play excellent, fundamental defense on all of Michigan’s starters. But it’s an Izzo group so it can absolutely do that.\n\nMichigan has the clearer path to victory here, but it’s worth factoring in the boost Michigan State will get from the Breslin Center’s home crowd.",

    "description": "We continue the series with one of the leaders of our video production side, Jared Clemons.",
    "fullText": "As part of the fun surrounding our 50th anniversary, Golfweek has been walking down Memory Lane with a number of former employees who helped make the brand what it is today.\n\nWe continue the series with someone who started as an intern and became an integral part of our video production side, Jared Clemons.\n\nFreelance video producer with numerous golf clients.\n\nGolfweek was well ahead of its time when it came to online video production. We were creating daily videos, posting them to the website, well before internet video was a thing. We did everything from tournament recaps, day-in-the-life videos, to game shows and more. We even livestreamed the NCAA Championship! This was before YouTube or Instagram were a thing! We were cutting-edge for sure.\n\nGolfweek's video team was a proving ground for what internet video would become. We were tasked with every part of the production to create our videos. One of my proudest moments is likely what got me hired at Golfweek. As an intern in the spring of 2007, I worked alongside our crew to livestream the NCAA Championship. It was quite the undertaking with several cameras spread along a hole, live commentators, and interviews. After the tournament, we had a discussion about the production and ways we could improve it, during which I proposed eliminating a third-party vendor and bringing the whole production in-house. I created a pitch, with a gear list, signal flow, and costs breakdown. Golfweek took a gamble on an intern and it paid off for both of us. We brought the whole production in-house and saved a ton of money, even improving the broadcast. We introduced graphics, preproduced stories, and live scoring. It was a full-fledged production and well ahead of its time.\n\nThat summer, I was offered a full-time position and spent the next five years traveling the world producing golf content, some of the best years of my life. I was able to cover everything from Tiger Woods winning the 2008 US Open, to Jordan Spieth winning the U.S. Junior Amateur, to Rickie Fowler in the Walker Cup and more. Truly a memorable time spent at Golfweek.\n\nBeing on the cutting edge, we were constantly pushing the technology of the time in order to produce the content we wanted to make for our audience. One such moment is producing a livestream of the Hogan Award at Colonial Country Club. With budgets tight, fellow Golfweek producer Mike Wolfe and I were tasked with creating not only a livestream of the award show for the internet broadcast, but also creating a quick-turn video recapping the nominees' day leading up to the awards, and then also all the video elements displayed to the live audience.\n\nLooking back, I really don't know how we were able to pull it off, but we did! A full production with live graphics and video switching being sent out to the multiple screens in the ballroom as well as our internet audience. I handled the production, fighting audio issues, playback issues and more, while Wolfe ran around to the several cameras placed in the ballroom acting as our camera operator. Somehow, we did it, but man, it was definitely a stressful production that could have been better suited for more than just two people!\n\nTPC Sawgrass is still one of my all-time favorites. I love a good Pete Dye design, whom we interviewed for GolfweekTV, and his whole philosophy behind golf course architecture. The Stadium course is not only a great test of golf, but also looks spectacular through the lens, and is an excellent venue to watch live golf as a fan.\n\n(Editor's note: We appreciate all the former employees who have contributed time and effort to this feature. The golf journalism community is a small one and we're proud of the achievements of all our former colleagues.)\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Golfweek 50th anniversary memories: Jared Clemons went from video intern to staffer",

    "fullText": "Alabama head coach Kalen DeBoer recently took a moment to speak to the media at the Senior Bowl in Mobile.\n\nDeBoer was able to share his thoughts on the recent changes to Alabama's offensive line during this, as the Tide have added a multitude of linemen through the transfer portal. Most notably, former four-star recruit Ty Haywood transferred to Alabama from Michigan, as the talented lineman will more than likely play a crucial role on the Tide's offense in 2026.\n\nDeBoer also revealed his thoughts surrounding the reported change at offensive line coach, which has seen the Crimson Tide move on from Chris Kapilovic after two seasons.\n\n\"It's about production.\" DeBoer stated. \"We know we've got to be better there. You know, mindset, and just execution. The details of the fundamentals that guys need, a lot of new faces that are going to be in that room, so kind of a fresh start there.\"\n\nThe Crimson Tide have also recently made a move to fill that void offensive line coaching position, reportedly hiring veteran Adrian Klemm.\n\nAlabama has also added numerous offensive lineman from the transfer portal, in addition to Haywood, throughout the offseason. Sophomore tackle Michael Carroll is expected to be the only returning starter in 2026, as Alabama will have an almost entirely different look to the offensive line next season.\n\nDeBoer and the Tide will kickoff the 2026 campaign on Sept. 5 against East Carolina.\n\nContact/Follow us @RollTideWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Alabama news, notes and opinion.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Roll Tide Wire: Kalen DeBoer reveals why Alabama football parted with Chris Kapilovic",

    "description": "The WNBA and members of the WNBA Players Association will meet in New York on Monday to discuss the stalled collective bargaining negotiations, Kelsey Plum said on Friday after Unrivaled shootaround.",
    "fullText": "PHILADELPHIA — The WNBA and members of the WNBA Players Association will meet in New York on Monday to discuss the stalled collective bargaining negotiations, Kelsey Plum said on Friday after Unrivaled shootaround.\n\nThe meeting will include members of the players union, the league’s CBA leadership, the legal team, members of the Labor Relations Committee and potentially other owners, a league source with knowledge of the discussions told Yahoo Sports, confirming the meeting.\n\nPlum said she and Naphessa Collier will attend since they can fly out after their early Unrivaled games on Sunday in Miami. Plum and Collier, who co-founded the offseason 3x3 league with Breanna Stewart, are both WNBPA vice presidents.\n\nIt is believed to be the first in-person meeting since shortly after the WNBA Finals concluded in October and the initial CBA deadline passed on Oct. 31. The league had reached out to the union for a couple of weeks now to put a meeting on the books, a source with knowledge of the talks told Yahoo Sports. Those requests were either ignored or declined until Thursday, the source said. Plum said to her knowledge, the meeting came together in recent days.\n\n“At the end of the day we’re human beings,” Plum said. “I think conversation face-to-face goes a long way, right? And you can understand body language, you can understand tone, you can understand all those type of things. And intent. And I just believe that eye contact is actually a massive thing that we forget.”\n\nPlayers, including Stewart, have said of late that they wanted such a meeting instead of working through lawyers. The league is proposing a revenue-sharing structure based on net revenue, whereas the union is proposing one based on gross revenue. There have been no new proposals in the new year after the latest extension expired on Jan. 9. A league source said the union submitted a proposal on Christmas Day that received no response, because it was essentially unchanged from the prior submission.\n\nNegotiations are continuing in a status quo period, with a moratorium passed on free agency to delay the massive movement expected when all but two of the veterans are unsigned. The league announced its 2026 schedule last week as talks hit the 15-month mark.\n\n“The thing is just sitting down and understanding the relationship and conversation, I think is No. 1, because let's be real, like when we play telephone with people in our own lives, a lot of times things can get scattered,” Plum said. “To be able to sit down face to face and say, ‘This is how I feel, this is how you feel, let's see what we can go from there.’”\n\nUnrivaled held practices in Philadelphia on Thursday ahead of the league’s first set of games outside of Miami. Players made available largely skirted away from CBA conversations, saying they’re focused on what they’re doing at Unrivaled or riding the line that they're unified as a player group. Tiffany Hayes said WNBPA executive director Terri Jackson met with players in Miami last week as they move toward the 100-days-out mark for the season to start on time on May 8.\n\nLexie Hull, a union representative for the Indiana Fever, said there is pressure as the timeline dwindles and media coverage increases over the lack of a deal.\n\n“People want a season,” Hull told reporters on Thursday. “We want a season. The league wants a season. And so that becomes just a much larger conversation. And I think that's what makes it feel like there's more pressure.”\n\nMessaging from the union has taken two tacks over the last year. Statements from the union and some players have followed hard, stern lines, with Satou Sabally calling an early proposal from the league a “slap in the face.” Others have been more nuanced and direct, describing small blips of progress, the need for compromise and a deal that benefits all.\n\nThat lack of unified messaging showed itself again on Friday, indicating schisms among the player base as they face a critical juncture.\n\nMinutes after Plum voiced optimism for an in-person meeting and exited the room in the halls of Xfinity Mobile Arena at the end of her media availability, Philadelphia native Natasha Cloud gave a much more fiery and animated retort, telling the crush of local TV media she was “disgusted with the W and how they’re handling this, and their lack of value, their lack of worth for us, their lack of even trying to attempt to move things with us.”\n\n“We will not f****** move until y'all move,” Cloud said, speaking directly into the closest camera. “And it would be the worst business decision of any business to not literally pay the players that make your business go. Without us, there is no W season. So the pressure is on the WNBA, on [Commissioner] Cathy [Engelbert], on [NBA Commissioner] Adam [Silver], on everyone that is in that front office. Do your job. Negotiate and pay your players, your workers.”\n\nAzurà Stevens, the Los Angeles Sparks player rep, spoke similarly, calling for new WNBA leadership and making clear she’s been preparing for a strike. She said she was not aware of an in-person meeting on Monday.\n\n“I feel like this is ridiculous that we’re waiting this long anyways,” Stevens said. “I just think this all needs to be over. We need to come to something and we either need to play or we don’t. It’s getting dragged out, and it’s honestly just frustrating at this point.”",

    "title": "49ers Draft profile: EDGE Zion Young",
    "description": "Set your watch to a few defensive linemen becoming 49ers in the draft, will Young be one of them?",
    "fullText": "Well, it’s draft season. So, not profiling multiple defensive linemen would be a mistake for the San Francisco 49ers’ projections. Toss in how unproductive the pass rush was last season, and we could be looking at two or three more defensive linemen added to the fold for whoever the 49ers choose for defensive coordinator. Nick Bosa’s return will help, and Bryce Huff and Keion White are cost-controlled, with Mykel Williams returning. But the 49ers’ philosophy of always drafting defensive linemen isn’t going to change.\n\nEnter Senior Bowl standout EDGE from Missouri, Zion Young. The 6’5 EDGE rusher might have been created in a lab, and John Lynch was on hand in Mobile to watch his practices, which surely turned heads. The things the 49ers look for in EDGE rushers are there for Young. Long arms and is capable of setting the edge against the run. It would be hard to think the 49ers haven’t done their homework on Young.\n\nStop me if you’ve heard this one. His college sack production isn’t high. With 2.5 sacks, production is a concern. Sure, the tools are there, but you have to finish. Again, the 49ers would be betting on traits and their development skills to get the most out of Young.\n\nMatt Holder of Bleacher Report listed his strengths and areas of development in his scouting report.\n\n– Young has a good frame and build, and appears to have good arm length.\n\n– Solid strength at the point of attack and the long arms help him get extension on blocks from offensive tackles.\n\n– Consistently resets the line of scrimmage against tight ends.\n\n– Decent at setting the edge and running his feet to avoid getting reached against the run.\n\n– Solid power and leg drive as a pass-rusher to occasionally collapse the pocket when bull rushing or turning speed to power.\n\n– Active hands as a pass-rusher and has shown improvement with his use of hands from 2024 to 2025.\n\n– Good pass-rusher motor to get coverage sacks.\n\n– Lacks burst/acceleration off the line of scrimmage to threaten offensive tackles with speed around the edge.\n\n– Not very twitchy and doesn’t show high-level athleticism as a pass-rusher.\n\n– Use of hands when rushing the passer is still a work in progress, his timing is off which limits his ability to take advantage of his long arms.\n\n– Subpar bend and angles around the edge, impacting his ability to corner at the top of the rush and leading to inefficient paths to the quarterback.\n\n– Has a habit of occasionally working around blocks.\n\n– Turns his shoulders perpendicular to the line of scrimmage when setting the edge.\n\n– As a freshman at Michigan State, he was involved in a fight in the tunnel after the game against Michigan and pled guilty to misdemeanor assault charges while also serving a suspension. Also, he was arrested for DWI on Dec. 13, two weeks before Missouri’s bowl game, per KOMU 8.\n\nWhile the physical skills will pique the 49ers’ interest, you have to wonder if character concerns will be the deal breaker for the front office. Also, can the 49ers afford to spend a second-round pick (his current projection) on a player with limited sack production? The 49ers must have instant contributors with their first two picks. Foregoing other positions for Young is a risk, but one that the 49ers will surely weigh during their process.",

    "description": "Sam Darnold could have been a Raider in 2025",
    "fullText": "The Las Vegas Raiders and the Seattle Seahawks became connected early in the 2025 offseason.\n\nThey made critical decisions at quarterback that was bound to shape the seasons of both teams. The affect ended up being dramatic.\n\nWe knew the backstory, of course. Days before the league season began, the Raiders acquired Seattle starting quarterback Geno Smith for a third-round pick. The Seahawks, then signed Sam Darnold in free agency.\n\nThere were a lot of opinions on the moves and many people thought the Raiders came out on top of the switch.\n\nThe Raiders, of course, went 3-14 and Pete Carroll, the driving force behind the Smith trade, was fired after one season. Smith, who played for Carroll in Seattle, is not likely to return to Las Vegas even though he signed a three-year deal with the Raiders after the trade.\n\nThe quarterback move worked much better for the Seahawks. They are headed to the Super Bowl in their first season with Darnold at quarterback and the second under coach Mike McDonald, who replaced Carroll there.\n\nThe Raiders went from being 4-13 in 2024 and to 3-14 in 2025. The Seahawks improved from going 10-7 to 14-3 and now are favored to beat the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl.\n\nFurther connecting the two teams was that The Athletic reported that Raiders’ part owner Tom Brady was not excited about pursuing Darnold in free agency and he was on board with the Smith move.\n\nSo, this is a good opportunity for the Raiders to learn from their mistakes and use the Seahawks as an example of how making the right decision can spur a huge positive impact in just one season.",

    "fullText": "Setting the flare screen for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Isaiah Hartenstein rolled to the basket. He caught the bounce pass and finished through Gobert's contest for the and-one layup. Welcome back. After a 16-game absence with his second soleus strain of the season, the Thunder are closer to being fully operational.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder were straight-up bullied in a 123-111 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. They trailed the entire night and by as many as 22 points.\n\nHartenstein finished with 11 points on 3-of-6 shooting, five rebounds and two assists. He shot 5-of-6 on free throws.\n\nUnder a minutes restriction, Hartenstein came off the bench. The Thunder lost the rebounding battle, but it didn't even matter in this one. That said, he somewhat helped in that department as he crashed the glass and even caught a few second-chance looks.\n\nNow that a huge piece of the puzzle is assembled back, the Thunder are close to playing their brand of basketball. Hartenstein helped them have an old-school center who can roll to the basket. The constant dunk threat is an element they've desperately missed over the last month.\n\nLet's see how Hartenstein looks the rest of the way. And let's hope the soleus strain stuff is finally behind him. But it's good to see him back on the floor. If the Thunder want to go back-to-back, they need a fully-healthy version of him — ala how he looked at the beginning of the year when he was an advanced stats darling.\n\n\"I thought his performance was actually pretty good. He made his free throws. Seems to be right back in rhythm. His conditioning seems to be pretty good for a guy that had a lower-body thing going on,\" Mark Daigneault said about Hartenstein. \"We're certainly happy to have him back. We'll take everybody and it's great to have him back in the fold.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on OKC Thunder Wire: Thunder 'happy' to have Isaiah Hartenstein return in loss to Timberwolves",

    "description": "Is a nervousness among Arsenal fans affecting the players in the Premier League title race? Alex Howell looks at what impact this could have on Mikel Arteta's side as they look to end a run of three second-placed finishes.",
    "fullText": "Arsenal are in control of the Premier League title race, but are the nerves starting to show as the pressure mounts?\n\nThe Gunners are having an excellent season - four points clear in top spot, into the Champions League last 16 after winning all eight group-phase games, have a first-leg lead over Chelsea in the Carabao Cup semi-final and are into the FA Cup fourth round.\n\nBut there were boos after a first home loss of the season by Manchester United last weekend, amid a nervousness from their fanbase about missing out on a possible championship again after three successive second-placed finishes.\n\nBoss Mikel Arteta gave a speech in his news conference before the midweek match against Kairat Almaty to urge supporters to \"jump on the boat\" with the team as they try to \"enjoy\" the title run-in.\n\nAnd he was again on the front foot before Saturday's trip to Leeds, with the Gunners looking for their first win in four league matches.\n\n\"It's just understanding where you are,\" said Arteta. \"Certainly, when you lose a game you have a lot of feelings.\n\n\"This group of players are so competitive and they seek excellence and when you don't reach it you ask yourself questions. My role there is to bring optimism and a reality of where we are.\n\n\"We are doing so many things so well and let's focus mainly on that. For sure we want to improve and be better in every area, but with that sense as well of self-confidence and conviction that we are on the right path.\"\n\nBut is the anxiety among supporters translating itself to the players? And what impact might that have?\n\nOne of the things about Arteta's Arsenal side which has been criticised is the Gunners do not have a clear goalscorer in the Premier League.\n\nThey signed Viktor Gyokeres in a summer deal worth £64m, but things have not clicked for the striker and he has just five league goals this season.\n\nBut the Gunners still have a hugely impressive record with the forward in the team, despite his issues in front of goal, and it is not only the Swedish international who has struggled to find the net.\n\nNone of the Arsenal frontline are particularly in top form.\n\nGyokeres – 0 non-penalty goals in past 11 Premier League appearances\n\nBukayo Saka – 0 goals in past 13 appearances in all competitions\n\nGabriel Martinelli – 0 goals in past 13 Premier League appearances\n\nNoni Madueke – 0 goals in past 25 Premier League appearances\n\nLeandro Trossard – one goal in past 11 appearances in all competitions\n\n\"Saka is the one that has really surprised us,\" said former England captain Steph Houghton on the Monday Night Club. \"For all the games he plays you think he has goals and assists, but to have none in his last 13 games is a surprise.\n\n\"He is one of their key players who is meant to be creating and scoring.\n\n\"We always thought Gyokeres was going to be the missing piece to the puzzle for Arsenal this season as the number nine.\n\n\"Sometimes, Arsenal become a little bit too predictable. Now teams have started to work them out. I feel as though they could be off the cuff more.\"\n\nArsenal have been Premier League leaders at this stage of a season three times previously, but only went on to lift the title once, in 2003.\n\nBBC Sport fan writer Laura Kirk-Francis said the feeling of nervousness was down to high stakes and supporters feeling like they have something to lose.\n\n\"It's a combination of a few things, but certainly there is some residual trauma about the two seasons where we felt on track for the title and suddenly fell away,\" she added.\n\n\"Because of that, I think we are all on edge searching for any signs that the same thing might happen again, hence the big meltdown after the Manchester United game.\"\n\nWith their last league title in 2004 and finishing behind Manchester City twice and then Liverpool last season, recent history does not bode well for Arsenal when it comes down to a tense finale.\n\nThey are currently clear of both City and Aston Villa after 23 games, with Liverpool 14 points behind in sixth spot.\n\n\"The nerves also come from a sense that this team feels deserving of silverware,\" said Kirk-Francis. \"Given the quality of the players, how consistent they've been, some of the performances at the beginning of the season - it's sparked a bit of desperation I think which leads to nervousness.\n\n\"I'd also say there are some parts of the fanbase who see this season as a now or never, particularly with Liverpool's fall-off and how shaky Man City have looked at times.\n\n\"The nervousness comes from a sense of having something within reach but knowing it could all fall apart at any one moment...and the only person to blame would be ourselves!\"\n\nArsenal are one of the biggest clubs in the world with a global fanbase, so the nerves among supporters are being felt both inside Emirates Stadium and in the wider arena, particularly on social media.\n\nAFTV on YouTube is one of the outlets synonymous with fan views and founder Robbie Lyle agrees with Arteta that fans and players need to embrace the challenge of a title race.\n\n\"We're going to have a lot more of these games between now and the end of the season,\" Lyle told BBC Sport at a Kick It Out event which is aiming to make the pub a more inclusive space for fans.\n\n\"Every team thinks, 'how can we stop Arsenal?' Keep it tight and get the anxiety flowing. This is what it is going to be from now until the end of the season.\n\n\"I still think Arsenal are good enough to win this league, I still think they are going to win this league. Just treat that as a lesson. In life you have lessons. That was a lesson on Sunday, go now and go and beat Leeds and let's get back on track.\"\n\nLike many Arsenal fans, the pain of missing out for three successive years, and not winning any trophy since the 2020 FA Cup, is a factor in why things feel so desperate.\n\n\"Three years in a row we have come second.\" added Lyle. \"Even though I'm trying my hardest to be calm, I'm thinking, 'oh no, we're not going to do this again are we?' I think it is just a natural thing.\n\n\"I have been to every game this season. We are the best team in this league - just go and win the thing now.\n\n\"We're trying to help them but we're nervous as well.\"\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

Carmichael most recently was in Denver under Sean Payton in 2024 and 2025 after spending nearly 20 years with Payton in New Orleans, 15 as offensive coordinator.\n\nCarmichael first broke into the NFL as the tight ends and offensive assistant coach with the Cleveland Browns in 2000. He and Brady are familiar with each other; they spent two years together with the Saints in 2017 and 2018. New Orleans was a top-four scoring offense in both of those seasons with Brady and Carmichael under Payton.\n\nThe Broncos fired Carmichael and other offensive assistants after losing the AFC championship game to the New England Patriots.\n\nCarmichael didn't have to wait long to find a new position.\n\nThe Bills' defensive and special teams coordinator positions are still vacant at time of publishing as Brady continues to fill out his staff.

    "fullText": "Nothing but excellent things have been said about new Browns HC Todd Monken since he was hired, and one of his former employers just gave him another spectacular endorsement.\n\nNational championship-winning Georgia Bulldogs HC Kirby Smart worked closely with Monken when the two were at UGA from 2020-2022, and Monken was a huge part of the reason why the Bulldogs were so successful as a program during that span.\n\nThey continue to be good friends to this day, and Coach Smart recently commented on Monken becoming the next head coach in Cleveland:\n\n“Todd brought an exceptional level of professionalism and creativity to our program. His ability to develop quarterbacks and craft game plans tailored to our players’ strengths was instrumental to our success. What we accomplished wouldn’t have been possible without his impact. We’re incredibly excited for Todd and Terri.”\n\nDespite rumors of other coaches “not liking Monken”, which have been circulating on social media recently, it doesn’t seem to be the case with anybody of significance who’s worked above or below him.\n\nMonken is also bringing two of his assistants from Baltimore with him to Cleveland in George Warhop and Travis Switzer, an Akron graduate.",

    "description": "Rob Brzezinski will lead the front office through the 2026 draft.",
    "fullText": "Nearly four weeks after ending the 2025 season on a five-game winning streak, the Vikings have made a major change to the football operation.\n\nG.M. Kwesi Adofo-Mensah has been fired.\n\nThe timing is unusual, to say the least. It implies that ownership engaged in a careful review and deliberation of the missteps that kept a Super Bowl-ready team from making the playoffs, headlined by the ill-fated handling of the quarterback position for 2025.\n\nFrom our examination of the coming coaching carousel, posted on December 31: \"Coach Kevin O’Connell is the right leader for the team. How much leading are they letting him do? Someone bungled the quarterback decision(s) for 2025. We’ve got a feeling that someone wasn’t O’Connell. If that sense is right, O’Connell needs to have more sway in 2026. While that doesn’t necessarily require G.M. Kwesi Adofo-Mensah to be replaced (then again, his draft record has not been flawless), it does require O’Connell to have a larger voice in personnel matters.\"\n\nToday's move suggests that O'Connell will have more power in 2026, especially as it relates to the structure of the quarterback depth chart.\n\nIt also suggests that, a year ago, O'Connell didn't want to let Sam Darnold and Daniel Jones leave in free agency. And that O'Connell perhaps didn't want to say \"no thank you\" to Aaron Rodgers. J.J. McCarthy, who missed all of his rookie year with a knee injury, clearly was not ready. The Vikings absolutely needed a veteran backup plan better than signing Carson Wentz less than two weeks before the first game of the regular season.\n\nArguably, the Vikings should have had a veteran starter, with McCarthy sitting for a year.\n\nLast March, while everyone waited to see what the Vikings would do at quarterback, some who were dealing with the Vikings expressed confusion as to who is calling the shots. This March, that likely won't be an issue.\n\nAdofo-Mensah was hired four years ago, in the same cycle that saw the purging of former coach Mike Zimmer and former G.M. Rick Spielman and the hiring of O'Connell. Adofo-Mensah received a contract extension after the 2024 season, as did O'Connell.\n\nThe Vikings also have announced that executive V.P. of football operations Rob Brzezinski will lead the front office through the draft. The search for a new General Manager will begin thereafter.\n\nThe broader question is whether O'Connell will emerge with control over the roster and/or the draft. Could he become, essentially, a Bill Belichick-type coach and de facto G.M., with a V.P. of player personnel or G.M. \"light\" to assist him?\n\nRegardless, with Darnold getting ready for the Super Bowl and the Vikings nearly a month into the aftermath of another season of unfulfilled expectations, ownership decided that something had to change. And that something was the General Manager.",

    "fullText": "The UFC’s middleweight titleholder took to social media to call out a fellow champion.\n\nChimaev recently said that ‘nobody wants to fight’ when he was asked when fans can expect to see him step back inside the Octagon.\n\n‘Borz’ initially planned a quick turnaround after his title win in August, but those plans were interrupted by an injury.\n\nHis history of pullouts and injuries had already raised questions about how often he would fight as champion.\n\nChimaev has not defended his belt yet, but his interest in facing Alex Pereira has made it clear he is considering a move up rather than staying at 185 pounds.\n\nChimaev has previously indicated that Nassourdine Imavov will be his next opponent when he finally returns to defend his middleweight belt.\n\nThe Chechen fighter is not showing much interest in sticking around to clear out the division before taking on other challenges.\n\n‘Borz’ has said he plans one more fight at 185 pounds before moving up to light heavyweight.\n\nChimaev reignited his rivalry with the 205-pound champion, Alex Pereira, by targeting him again in a series of social media posts.\n\n“If you show respect, I show back respect. Chama team talk too much, that’s why no respect anymore,” he wrote on X.\n\nPrior to this, the 31-year-old had highlighted what he believes separates him from the Brazilian champion, sharing images on social media of Pereira and his coach – Glover Teixeira, a former light heavyweight champion – after they suffered losses in the UFC.\n\n“‘Borz’ 15 W. ‘Chama’ 13 W, and 3 losses. Only this is the difference between us,” he said before that post.\n\nDin Thomas took some flak for saying Chimaev holding a UFC belt would be bad for the sport.\n\nBeyond his lack of activity, the suggestion that he might leave middleweight after just one title fight is not likely to go down well with fans either.\n\nThe way he won the title was also criticised, so it has been a rocky start to his time as champion.\n\n‘Borz’ could change that with some strong showings, but the wait for those performances is already starting to feel drawn out.",

    "fullText": "As we dig into Premier League predictions for Week 24, one fixture jumps off the fixture list as one that could shake up the expectations for the top four picture, and that's Newcastle's visit to Liverpool at Anfield.\n\nYou could forgive Eddie Howe if he flat out hated Liverpool — yes, even after the Magpies ended their long trophy drought by claiming the League Cup with a win at Wembley Stadium last winter.\n\nThat's because Howe has otherwise been beaten by the Reds way more often than not during his dozen-or-so years managing against them with Bournemouth and Newcastle.\n\nMORE — Champions League playoff draw complete\n\nAnd at Anfield, you can basically forget about it.\n\nHowe's record is 2W-2D-19L all-time against Liverpool, with the wins coming at Wembley and St. James' Park. Anfield has been especially cruel to Howe, who was 1D-5L there as Bournemouth boss and is yet to claim a point from four trips there with Newcastle.\n\nIs that why he limited minutes for his preferred attacking trop of Anthony Gordon, Harvey Barnes, and Yoane Wissa in the Champions League at midweek while giving Bruno Guimaraes, Kieran Trippier, and Jacob Murphy — two of whom are just returning to fitness — zero minutes at the Parc des Princes?\n\nMaybe, but Arne Slot's men produced a 5-0 lead after about an hour at midweek and won't have felt too stressed by their workload versus Qarabag, who are coincidentally the Magpies next opponent in the Champions League.\n\nCan Howe's Magpies shake off their history and scoop up a rare result on Merseyside?\n\n10am ET Saturday — NBCSN — Watch live on Peacock\n\nEverton won the reverse fixture but Brighton have been much better home than away this season. The Seagulls are 5W-5D-1L at the Amex and 2W-4D-6L as visitors. But Everton are now healthy in the midfield and can win a battle with several different combinations. Branthwaite’s return opens up a lot for the Toffees, and they may figure things out on Saturday. Brighton 1-2 Everton.\n\n10am ET Saturday — USA — Watch on USA Network\n\nThe Gunners attack is healthy and if their explosion is coming soon. That’s not to say they’ll snap out of it straightaway, but their slow run of form combined with Leeds’ stunning record against the big boys gives this the aire of regression to the norm. Team “2-nil to the title” returning this weekend?. Leeds 0-2 Arsenal.\n\n10am ET Saturday— Watch live on Peacock\n\nBournemouth have just one win away from the Vitality Stadium this season and they are bedding in a number of new components while missing key figures like Tavernier, Kluivert, and Adams. They have the tactical acumen to find a win here, but Wolves should show up with vigor and this could be a day of hope for Edwards’ boys. Wolves 1-0 Bournemouth.\n\n12:30pm ET Saturday— USA — Watch on USA Network\n\nThe Blues have been producing chances moving forward but also give up a fair amount of opportunities going back the other way. West Ham conceded a whopping 12 goals off corner kicks while Chelsea have been productive with their corners. A lot of this adds up in favor of the hosts, even if they had to deal with a Champions League match at midweek. Chelsea 2-1 West Ham.\n\n3pm ET Saturday — NBC — Watch online via NBC.com\n\nNewcastle impressed in the Champions League with a draw away to Paris Saint-Germain, especially since the Starting XI made it appear that Eddie Howe had one eye on this fixture. Liverpool hammered Qarabag at midweek and edged the Magpies in the reverse fixture, which saw 10-man Newcastle come back from 2-nil down just to lose late. Both sides are stretched so goals are on the menu. Liverpool 1-1 Newcastle.\n\n9am ET Sunday — USA — Watch on USA Network\n\nBrentford have not been great away from the Gtech Community Stadium, and any advantage given by Villa’s Thursday match in the Europa League has been minimized by Emery’s heavy squad rotation. Aston Villa 2-1 Brentford.\n\n9am ET Sunday— NBCSN — Watch live on Peacock\n\nMan Utd's turnaround under Michael Carrick has been quite a treat for Red Devils fans, and there will be plenty guessing that it will continue at Old Trafford against the Cottagers. The sides drew 1-1 at Craven Cottage and deservedly so, but the Red Devils may get enough extra juice from the home crowd to deliver another three points to their new boss. Manchester United 2-1 Fulham.\n\n9am ET Sunday — Watch live on Peacock\n\nPalace heads must be spinning with Oliver Glasner set to leave in the summer and Mateta possibly joining Marc Guehi and Eberechi Eze as stars to depart Selhurst Park since the summer. Adam Wharton missing this game through suspension just adds to the misery. Forest won’t be as fresh but it’s not difficult to project at least something from the group. Nottingham Forest 1-1 Crystal Palace.\n\n11:30am ET Sunday — NBCSN — Watch live on Peacock\n\nSpurs’ injury list is long and they haven’t been great at home to boot. Anything’s possible as Frank knows how to play the underdog role, but the likely result lies on the side of Pep Guardiola’s visitors. Tottenham Hotspur 0-2 Manchester City.\n\n3pm ET Monday— USA — Watch on USA Network\n\nSunderland have regressed to the norm with regular xG losses over the past month. The question is whether their norm is higher than that of Monday's visitors. One might argue that the Clarets have been as unlucky as Sunderland's been fortunate, but the Stadium of Light feels like a tiebreaker here. Maybe that's the wrong word... Sunderland 0-0 Burnley.",

    "fullText": "Novak Djokovic has just booked his spot in an 11th Australian Open final after seeing off Jannik Sinner, the two-time defending champion.\n\nDjokovic put on a remarkable show at Rod Laver Arena, coming through 3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 in a match that lasted over four hours.\n\nDjokovic’s endurance drew plenty of admiration from the Melbourne crowd and set up a meeting with Carlos Alcaraz in the final.\n\nAlcaraz had already impressed earlier in the day, surviving a five-set battle against Alexander Zverev to reach Sunday’s decider.\n\nAlcaraz will likely be the favourite to win, but tennis legend John McEnroe went as far as to suggest that Djokovic delivered his best-ever performance against Sinner.\n\nWhen asked about that remark, Djokovic replied: “To be honest, I wouldn’t dare to call it ever, finest ever, but definitely the finest in the last couple of years.\n\n“Under the circumstances and semis against Sinner, who has been playing the best tennis of his life in the last couple of years, particularly here, two-time defending champion, doesn’t get better than this.”\n\nThe 36-year-old also spoke about his mindset at this stage of his career and where he finds motivation.\n\n“Honestly, when I started my preparations for the new season and kind of set the goals. It’s no secret that Grand Slams are where I want to play my best tennis. But it becomes more difficult for me to motivate myself and ask myself questions.\n\n“What is it that I’m looking for from myself? I was imagining really playing against Jannik and Carlos at final stages of Grand Slams this year and battling it out. And really giving it all that I have.”\n\nDaniil Medvedev defeated Rafael Nadal in five sets earlier on Saturday to reach his fourth Australian Open final.\n\nIt’s a final that feels right for more than one reason, with both players standing on the verge of their own historic achievements.\n\nAlcaraz, already holding titles at the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open, can complete his career Grand Slam with a win here.\n\nIf he does it, the 22-year-old would become the youngest man ever to accomplish the feat.\n\nOn the other side, Djokovic is currently tied with Margaret Court on 24 Grand Slam titles and is just one win away from standing alone at the top.\n\nIt’s a clash of youth versus experience in Melbourne, where both players might still be feeling their way back after demanding semifinal matches in tough conditions.",

    "description": "The 38-year-old Djokovic stunned defending champion Jannik Sinner in an epic five-set stand to keep his dream of a 25th grand slam alive by returning to the Australian Open final",
    "fullText": "As Novak Djokovic turned his attention to his latest showdown with Jannik Sinner, he heard something that would end up flipping this Australian Open upside down. In the post-match press conference that followed his quarter-final with Lorenzo Musetti, where Djokovic admitted he was preparing to head home before the Italian retired injured from two sets up, he bristled at the wording of a question that asked him to compare how he felt “chasing” Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal at the start of his career to how he feels now, with Carlos Alcaraz and Sinner dominating.\n\nDjokovic stopped. The wording of the question, he said, was “disrespectful” in leaving out the decade in between where he had been the dominant force. Suddenly, he had that fire in his eye. “I’m going to fight until the last shot, until the last point, and do my very best to challenge them,” Djokovic said.\n\nTwo nights later, at close to 2am in Melbourne, Djokovic rose to the challenge as he produced a vintage performance, and one of the wins of his career, in dethroning the Australian Open champion Sinner 3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 in four hours and nine minutes. Djokovic had lost five matches in a row to Sinner and, in falling two sets down to the No 2 seed’s compatriot Musetti on Wednesday, had appeared so far away from the force that would be required to overturn what were possibly the longest pre-match odds he had ever faced. Djokovic, though, was not waving the white flag.\n\n“There’s a lot of people that doubt me,” he later said. “I see there is a lot of experts all of a sudden that wanted to retire me or have retired me many times the last couple of years. You know, I want to thank them all, because they gave me strength. They gave me motivation to prove them wrong, which I have tonight. For me, it’s not a surprise, to be honest.”\n\nIn becoming the oldest Australian Open finalist of all time, at 38, Djokovic will bid for the standalone record of 25 grand slam singles titles on Sunday against the world No 1 Alcaraz, 18 months on from his previous grand slam final where he lost in straight sets to the Spaniard at Wimbledon. Last season, in exiting all four grand slams at the semi-final stage, you could question why Djokovic was persisting with his quest for a 25th. After he was demolished by Alcaraz at the US Open in September, he conceded that Alcaraz and Sinner were “too good” and that beating them over best-of-five would be “very, very difficult”.\n\nCrucially, though, “not impossible”.\n\n“I said that they were playing on a different level, so I just had to find that level,” Djokovic remarked on court. In ending the Alcaraz-Sinner duopoly of grand slam finals, stopping their run of consecutive finals at three, Djokovic was lost for words as members of his team wept in the coaching box. When Djokovic was asked about being in a position to challenge for the grand slam titles record, he replied: “Honestly, it feels like I’m winning already tonight.”\n\nFor the Serbian, the performance he found, at this stage of the tournament, felt enough. He had been handed a fortunate break when his fourth-round opponent Jakub Mensik withdrew due to injury last week, giving Djokovic a walkover. He was then “extremely lucky” when Musetti suddenly retired from two sets up in their quarter-final, struck down by a leg injury. It was an undeniable boost. As he explained almost six months ago in New York, to have a chance against the best in the world, Djokovic needed to be fresh and be prepared to go the distance.\n\nHe got there from two sets to one down, and as Sinner closed in on a 20th consecutive victory at the tournament. Earlier in the third set, Djokovic was panting heavily between points, at one stage covering his face with his towel. Yet Djokovic never let Sinner out of his sight. His serving was as accurate and pinpoint as it had been for years. His forehand speed was massively increased, reminiscent of his run from three years ago when he lifted his 10th Australian Open title. Key to the victory was Djokovic’s defiance on break points, saving 16 of the 18 he faced. “He won the last five matches against me. He had my number, so I had to change my number for tonight,” Djokovic said. He went bigger than ever before.\n\nAnd now, in Sunday’s final, awaits an opponent who is also on the cusp of history after his own epic. In an all-time men’s semi-final day at Melbourne Park, Alcaraz advanced to his first final by defeating third seed Alexander Zverev in five hours and 27 minutes, the third-longest match in the tournament’s history. The Spaniard will be aiming to achieve the career grand slam against Djokovic, with the chance to become the youngest man of all time to complete the set. Yet the youngster, at 22, will need to recover from his own marathon after struggling physically before his fightback.\n\nAlcaraz has won both of their grand slam finals at Wimbledon. Yet, in the 2024 Olympics final, Djokovic summoned an outstanding effort against Alcaraz to win his elusive gold in Paris. Turns out, that wasn’t his last stand after all. “I have to come back in a couple of days and fight the number one in the world,” said Djokovic, who has never lost an Australian Open final in 10 previous appearances. “I just hope that I’ll have enough gas to go toe to toe with him. That’s my desire, and then let the gods decide the winner.”",

    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills introduced current offensive coordinator Joe Brady as the franchise’s 21st head coach Thursday during a press conference at One Bills Drive.\n\nOn a frigid Western New York day, surrounded by president of football operations Brandon Beane, reigning NFL MVP Josh Allen and many members of the Bills, Brady said he believes in “being the weather,” a reference to his high-energy approach to being Buffalo’s newest head coach.\n\n“It starts with a new energy, a new mentality and a new vision,” said Brady, who at 36 years old is currently the youngest head coach in the league.\n\n“I’m going to bring the energy every single day. I believe people are going to feed off that. I truly believe in being the temperature. I’m the weather, and they’re going to feel it every single day, a mentality.

The past nine years in this organization matter. I’m understanding of that. I’m appreciative of the opportunity to be a part of it. They matter deeply, and they deserve respect. I’m so grateful for coach McDermott. I love coach McDermott, and I’m going to do whatever I can to build upon the things he laid, and the foundation he laid.”\n\nLinked below: learn more about the key developments and takeaways from Brady’s press conference, including how Brady emphasized that this is Josh Allen’s team, and the organization’s singular focus is helping their quarterback finally win a Super Bowl.\n\n“Every decision this organization makes is with the thought of Josh Allen and the players in mind,” Brady said. “I’d be crazy not to.”\n\nJoe Brady tabbed as ‘the perfect fit’ in being named 19th head coach in Bills history – Buffalo News (subscription required)\n\nWhat we learned from Joe Brady’s introductory news conference as Bills head coach – The Athletic (subscription required)\n\nJoe Brady brings the gusto, but what will new Buffalo Bills coach change?

    "fullText": "Atletico Madrid’s squad has been going through a profound reshaping over the past two summers, and this one could bring about more change. One of their stalwarts through their Champions League and La Liga runs could bid farewell to the club in the summer.\n\nLast year Jose Maria Gimenez was one of the players that Atletico would have considered bids for, had the right offer come in for the Uruguayan. There was supposedly some interest from Saudi Arabia, but nothing came of it. This summer he could receive further attention from elsewhere.\n\nAccording to Diario AS, Serie A giants AC Milan are keen to sign Jose Maria Gimenez in the summer. They say that Sporting Director Igli Tare is a fan of his, and feels that bringing in a player with his experience at the top level, at the price he would cost, would be a good move.\n\nThey go on to say that Milan have not yet been in touch with his camp, and will only do so when they agree a deal with Atletico, but their feeling is that an agreement can be found for less than €30m. The 31-year-old has two years left on his deal this summer.\n\nWere he to leave, Gimenez would only do so after the World Cup, in July. After 12 years at Atletico, he is also keen to leave on good terms if he is to do so. There is no chance of any move occurring in the January transfer window as a result.\n\nOver the last two seasons, Atletico have signed three central defenders, and converted Marc Pubill into a centre-back. Over €65m has been spent on David Hancko and Robin Le Normand, while Clement Lenglet arrived on a free. In addition to the injury issues that have dogged Gimenez, it is perhaps a suggestion that they are preparing for life beyond the Uruguayan veteran.",

    "fullText": "Why Vikings fired general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah in surprise move originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings made a surprising move on Friday, with the team firing general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah after four seasons.\n\nThe decision comes just eight months after the Vikings decided to extend his contract. That, combined with the timing of the decision, which comes well after teams usually decide to make a change at general manager, makes this a surprise.\n\nSo, why did the Vikings give Adofo-Mensah the boot? Here's what we know.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adam Schefter, who cites talk in league circles, there was a \"tension\" in the Vikings' building, with one source even going so far as to say the tension was \"ugly.\"\n\n\"Throughout the season, there was talk about an underlying 'tension' in the Vikings’ building in league circles. One league source said it had been 'ugly' in Minnesota. Then today, the Vikings fired Kwesi Adofo-Mensah,\" Schefter reported.\n\nNFL Network's Ian Rapoport reports that the tension was between Adofo-Mensah and the coaching staff, and he strongly hints the team's quarterback decision in the 2025 offseason was the reason for that.\n\nOf course the Vikings let Sam Darnold walk after a 14-win season in favor of starting J.J. McCarthy, the team's 2024 first-round pick.\n\nMcCarthy struggled mightily through his first season as a starter while also dealing with injuries and the Vikings finished 9-8 and fell short of the playoffs.\n\nMeanwhile, Darnold had another fantastic season with the Seattle Seahawks, who are now in the Super Bowl.\n\nAdofo-Mensah's draft history was another stain on his record.\n\nWe won't make a final judgement on McCarthy yet, but it isn't looking good for him and Mensah had struggled with making good picks overall over four years.\n\nRaiders head coach search down to 2 finalists after candidate withdraws\n\nBills named in Mike Evans rumor that paints bleak outlook for Bucs future\n\nKlint Kubiak head coach rumor lists odds for Raiders, Cardinals\n\nKenneth Walker's future with Seahawks gets updated outlook\n\nSteelers insider predicts Pittsburgh will cut $12 million playmaker",

    "fullText": "Alec Pierce going long for a bomb each game was something to be expected. That has been his role with the Indianapolis Colts since they drafted him in 2022. More times than not, Pierce would bring the pass in. More times than not, it would be the only pass he would catch. This year saw a new Pierce. This year saw a Pierce who has set himself up nicely for a new contract because he elevated his play on the field.\n\nThis was far and away his best year as a professional. He set a career high in targets at 84, receptions at 47, and yards at 1,003. He hauled in six touchdowns, led the league for the second year in a row in yards per catch, and did it all in just 15 games. This was the player fans had hoped the Colts had drafted out of Cincinnati. It can take a receiver a minute to adjust to the NFL, and Pierce is adjusting at the right time.\n\nWhile he led the league in yards per catch this year, Pierce did so much more than rip off huge chunks at a time. He stepped up as the number one receiver on the team this year and became a go-to in critical situations. His route tree expanded, and he created enough separation for his targets to skyrocket. He still kept the long bomb ability but added the necessary subtle and nuanced portions to his game to make him a more well rounded player.\n\nAlec Pierce went from someone who wasn’t part of the long-term plans for the Colts before the season started to an integral cog. His prior production and what we had seen didn’t justify a new contract. What a difference a year makes because the talk now is whether the Colts can afford to bring him back. It seems a deal will be reached and Pierce will continue to make big plays in Lucas Oil for years to come.",

    "fullText": "The Trump administration announced on Friday that the president has signed an executive order directing the creation of an IndyCar race on Washington D.C.'s Capitol Mall. The race would be held on August 23 as part of a larger celebration of the 250th anniversary of American independence.\n\nAccording to an announcement shared by IndyCar, the executive order directs the \"White House Task Force on Celebrating America’s 250th Birthday\" to designate a route for the race. The full order, titled \"Celebrating American Greatness with American Motor Racing,\" was published on the White House website on Friday.\n\nAs an executive order is not itself law, the declaration is not the same as a completed plan to host an IndyCar race around the nation's capital. A tight seven-month timeline will make actually putting the event together a challenge, but a release shared by IndyCar quotes both D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, among other enthusiastic stakeholders working to make the event happen. That suggests some level of cooperation between the city and multiple departments of the presidential administration, greatly increasing the odds that the race comes together before the scheduled Summer date.\n\nNeither IndyCar nor the administration have shared a track layout for the potential race. All mentions of the race note it only as an event celebrating the 250th anniversary of independence, suggesting that this is meant to be a one-time event. That could make a high-profile route through the National Mall more plausible, although construction along a track in that area would still mean major interruptions at some of the country's most-visited tourist sites throughout Spring and Summer.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

    "fullText": "49ers injury conspiracy theory, explained: Experts debunk link to Levi’s Stadium electric substation from viral post originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nVirtually all of the San Francisco 49ers' stars have been affected by injuries over the past two years, including George Kittle’s torn Achilles, season-ending injuries to Nick Bosa and Fred Warner, Brock Purdy’s extended absence, Brandon Aiyuk’s torn ACL, and more.\n\nMany have chalked it up to bad luck or training staff issues, but a new theory has emerged from dubious sources: the 49ers’ injury woes may be linked to an electric substation near the team’s stadium and practice facility.\n\nSome players have even heard the theory firsthand, though experts say there’s no credibility to the idea.\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the electric substation conspiracy theory and why experts dismiss it.\n\nNFL divisional round picks, predictions\n\nRanking eight teams remaining in 2026 NFL playoffs\n\nNFL divisional round picks against the spread\n\nThe theory linking an electric substation near the 49ers’ stadium and practice facility began with a tweet from Peter Cowan, who wrote in a Substack article that “low-frequency electromagnetic fields can degrade collagen, weaken tendons, and cause soft-tissue damage.”\n\nCowan argues that while the supposed damage may be harmless to the average person, it could put players at higher risk for soft-tissue injuries, such as ligament and tendon tears. “The damage is subtle, until a routine cut or block ends in catastrophic rupture,” he says.\n\nLow-frequency electromagnetic fields can degrade collagen, weaken tendons, and cause soft-tissue damage at levels regulators call \"safe.\"\n\nWe have a real world case study proving this:\n\nAn NFL team whose practice facility sits next to a massive electrical substation.\n\nTHREAD 🧵… pic.twitter.com/fOVvrVTu5I\n\n— Peter Cowan | Sunlight is Life (@living_energy) January 6, 2026\n\nCowan isn’t the first to raise concerns about the Silicon Valley Power Mission Substation, a real facility, and its possible link to the 49ers’ injury woes. Former 49ers guard Jon Feliciano once said players joked in the locker room that the substation was causing injuries.\n\n49ers WR Kendrick Bourne proved that the theory made its way back to the locker room after the team's wild-card win over the Philadelphia Eagles, telling reporters, \"It’s that power plant,\" before quickly adding that he was joking.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, some players are taking it seriously, citing agents who claim they have heard concerns from clients about the possibility of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) leading to a greater risk of injury, potentially hurting the 49ers' chances of recruiting players to the Bay Area in free agency.\n\nHowever, experts are pushing back on the theory. Bristol Medical School professor Frank de Vocht told the Washington Post the idea that EMFs are leading to more injuries is \"nonsense,\" while UC Davis radiology professor Jerrold Bushberg told Front Office Sports, \"there is no firmly established evidence\" that EMFs can weaken soft tissue.\n\nMORE:49ers' injury timeline, from Nick Bosa to George Kittle\n\nThere are two different types of radiation, Northwestern radiology professor Gayle Woloschak told SFGate: ionizing and non-ionizing. While ionizing is dangerous and is found in nuclear reactors, non-ionizing radiation surrounds people just about all of the time and is what could be emitted from an electrical substation.\n\n\"In the huge number of studies that have tried to look at the effects of non-ionizing radiation on cells, there’s been no reported damage to DNA, proteins or other molecules that’s been identified,\" Wolschak said.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle spoke to University of Colorado professor Frank Barnes, who leads a research group \"looking at the effects of electric and magnetic fields on biological systems.\" Barnes was not definitive, warning that research about how electromagnetic fields might impact humans has dried up in recent decades, but said the theory is \"unlikely.\"\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, Barnes said, EMFs could be \"changing the oxidative stress level\" of players, forcing them to overcompensate when working out, but even the odds of that being true are \"pretty darn low.\" The idea that EMFs are actually weakening soft tissues just cannot be proven at this point, Barnes explained.\n\nEven more convincing than any science might be the simple fact the 49ers have practiced next to the substation in Santa Clara since 1988, the Washington Post confirmed, long before Levi's Stadium was built. The team's rash of injuries is largely tied to the last handful of years\n\nMORE:Ranking the 18 greatest players in 49ers history\n\nEMF radiation is frequency waves emitted by just about every electronic device. Non-ionizing radiation, which is all radiation outside of nuclear reactors, nuclear weapons and similar devices, is considered too weak to damage cells or DNA.\n\nWhile the 49ers theory argues the Silicon Valley Power Mission Substation is emitting such high levels of EMF radiation that it is affecting players' soft tissue, there is no indication such a level of EMF radiation can actually weaken tissue.\n\nWhile ionizing EMF radiation can damage cells are requires precaution, non-ionizing EMF radiation is \"not known to damage DNA or cells directly,\" according to the National Cancer Institute. While some claim to have EMF hypersensitivity that causes headaches, fatigue or skin issues, EMF hypersensitivity is not a recognized medical condition.\n\nAn electrical substation is intended to \"convert electricity into different voltages\" and transmit it into homes, businesses and neighborhoods as needed, according to National Grid.\n\nMORE: Who is on the Mount Rushmore of Bay Area sports?\n\nThe NFL's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Allen Sills, weighed in on the theories, essentially saying in a long0winded weigh that it is likely false, but not enough data exists to equivocally say the theories are wrong.\n\n\"Obviously, we’re aware of those reports. Listen, I would say we look at injury causation across the board. We consult with experts throughout sports medicine and other industries to try to understand and gain as comprehensive an understanding of injury causation as we can.\n\nI would tell you that I’m not familiar with anything in the sports medicine literature that supports those associations, but I would also tell you that injury causation is really complex. If you think about biology and medicine, you don’t have usually one single factor that drives biological systems. And so when we think about injury causation, whether it’s lower extremity strains or ACL or concussion . . . it’s equipment, it’s training, it’s prior injury history, its exposure, it’s play type. There’s so many things that go into that. And so, I think it’s very rare in a biological system that you’ll see one factor that really drives an injury risk.\n\nSo with that being said, we look at all factors, we look at it very comprehensively. I think it’s also important . . . to say that we have seen significant erroneous conclusions drawn from people using publicly-available data sources. And what I mean by that is there’s research that often gets published where people take injury reports that are distributed in media and use that to try to assess an injury burden. And those are almost universally wrong because they’re just not complete. And they’re not complete because they don’t have all the data because not everything gets put into those disclosure systems.\n\nAnd so that’s why we put so much stock in our own data, because we know we have a complete record through the electronic health record, all 32 clubs reporting to that record. We have a world-class data science and epidemiology company that extracts all that data, goes and analyzes it. We have the full picture of those injuries. . . .\n\nSo we try to be transparent, but we try to be comprehensive, and I would just caution again against drawing any conclusions based on publicly-available data sources. And I’ll just dive one notch deeper into that. One of the things that’s been said is that that club has led the league in non-direct contact lower extremity injuries. That’s simply not true. That’s false. So I think we have obviously a lot of work to do on all these injuries and we’ll consider any and all mechanisms, but that’s sort of the maybe broader picture on that particular question.\"\n\nDespite being named the San Francisco 49ers, the team plays and practices in Santa Clara, about 35 minutes south of the city in its name. Santa Clara sits just to the north of San Jose.\n\nLevi's Stadium is situated next to a residential neighborhood on its east side and an amusement park to its south and west. The Santa Clara Convention Center is also across the street from the stadium.\n\nThe 49ers' outdoor practice field is next to the stadium and directly across from the Silicon Valley Power Mission Substation.\n\nMORE:Inside Kyle Shanahan's family tree\n\nWhile some teams have their practice facilities in a different location than their stadium, the 49ers have their practice field situated directly next to Levi's Stadium.\n\nJust to the south of both the stadium and the practice field, which is labeled \"multi-use field\" on the map below, is the Silicon Valley Power Mission Substation.\n\nHere's a complete look at the campus:\n\nAt the 49ers' press conference following their season-ending loss to the Seattle Seahawks, general manager John Lynch said the team will look into the conspiracy.\n\n\"Because it deals with allegedly the health and safety of our players, I think you have to look into everything,\" Lynch said, via ESPN. \"We've been reaching out to anyone and everyone to see, does a study exist other than a guy sticking an apparatus underneath the fence and coming up with a number that I have no idea what that means? That's what we know exists. We've heard that debunked.\"\n\nLynch acknowledged that injuries happen to every team in the NFL, but San Francisco still puts resources into trying to improve the team's injury prevention.\n\n\"What we strive to do is never to eliminate injuries, but to mitigate injuries,\" he said. \"And I think we have a lot of good processes. We'll challenge them all. And that process has begun. It never frankly stopped. But yes, we'll look at everything, and we'll examine everything.\"\n\nLevi's Stadium opened in 2014, less than three years after workers first broke ground. After finalizing a deal with Santa Clara, the 49ers broke ground on Levi's Stadium in April of 2012 and built it in time for an official opening at the start of the 2014 season.\n\nLevi's Stadium hosted its first Super Bowl in its second season of operation.\n\nThe 49ers played at Candlestick Park in San Francisco from 1971-2013, sharing the stadium with MLB's San Francisco Giants for the first 29 years of that stretch. Candlestick Park was located next to Candlestick Point, just south of the heart of the city.\n\nAfter the Giants moved in 2000, the 49ers worked to find a newer stadium for themselves but gave up hope on finding a deal for a new venue in San Francisco in 2006. After looking at locations in Santa Clara, plans for what is now Levi's Stadium started to reach the approval phase in 2009.\n\nThe 49ers have been headquartered in Santa Clara since the late 1980s, so the move consolidated all of the team's operations, from front office to practice to games themselves, onto one campus.\n\nMORE:How Kyle Shanahan, Sean McVay, other coaches developed from 2013 Washington staff\n\nHere are the 49ers' notable injuries this season and whether they are soft-tissue injuries:\n\nThe laundry list of 49ers injuries before 2025 isn't any shorter. From Christian McCaffrey's calf and knee injuries that derailed his 2024 campaign, to Brandon Aiyuk's 2024 ACL tear, to Nick Bosa's 2020 ACL tear and to Jimmy Garoppolo's ACL tear in 2018 and season-ending foot injury in 2022, the injury bug always seems to bite San Francisco's stars.\n\nKittle in particular has also dealt with numerous soft tissue injuries over the years, including an ankle issue that kept him off the field at the start of this season, though he has been able to stay on the field for most of the past five seasons.\n\nOne look at the 49ers' 2025 injuries indicates most of the notable ones are soft tissue issues. While Jauan Jennings' broken ribs and Fred Warner's fractured ankle don't fit that description, San Francisco lost both Bosa and Mykel Williams to ACL tears, while Purdy's turf toe injury involved the severe stretching of ligaments or tendons in the big toe.\n\nMORE:Meet Brock Purdy's family tree, including wife Jenna and baby daughter\n\nKittle suffered a torn Achilles in the 49ers' wild-card playoff win over the Eagles, going down after his first catch of the game. Replay showed the classic mechanism for an Achilles tear, with Kittle's calf appearing to reverberate after the tendon snapped.\n\nThe injury is set to force Kittle to spend most of the offseason rehabbing, and his path back to the field in time to play Week 1 is a difficult one.\n\nThe 2026 Super Bowl will be played at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara. It will be the second Super Bowl at the venue and the first in 10 years, after the stadium hosted Super Bowl 50 following the 2015 season.\n\nThe electrical substation theory doesn’t suggest that a single three-hour game at Levi’s Stadium increases injury risk. Rather, it claims that practicing near the facility daily over several months could gradually weaken players’ ligaments and tendons.\n\nOf course, there is no evidence that the substation has any effect on players’ injury risk.",

    "fullText": "Two years after returning to the WWE, CM Punk has rewritten his legacy with a list of accomplishments that already challenge his initial run. Punk has rocketed up the roster and won the World Heavyweight Championship on two occasions, he’s main-evented WrestleMania, and for the second time is now the cover star of WWE 2K26. In doing so, Punk joins the likes of Rhea Ripley, Roman Reigns, Cody Rhodes and Bianca Belair as WWE athletes who have earned the honor to feature on the annual series.\n\n“Oh man, it's insane,” Ripley tells Uncrowned, reflecting on her own recognition of being named a WWE 2K24 co-cover star alongside Belair.\n\n“It's like how hard you've worked throughout the year has been noticed and appreciated, and it's taken to that higher height where now everyone's going to see your face whenever they go into a Target or a gaming store. You're going to be everywhere.”\n\nBest in the World….. STILL 😏 @CMPunk #WWE2K26 pic.twitter.com/KVYpnQ57hC\n\n— #WWE2K26 (@WWEgames) January 30, 2026\n\nThis year’s game features a slew of enhancements mostly focused on what you can do and who you can wrestle with. With a heavy emphasis on the Attitude Era, the game features its biggest roster ever, boasting more than 400 playable characters. It also includes a slew of new match types that defined the Attitude Era like I Quit, 3 Stages of Hell, Inferno and Dumpster matches, along with an all-new 2K Showcase mode centered around the standard edition cover star, Punk. The latter spotlights Punk’s favorite matches throughout his career, his dream matches that never were, and an interesting “What If…” twist that guides players through an alternate timeline where he never left the promotion at all.\n\nOf course, “What if” moments aren’t unique to Punk. For nearly every star on WWE's roster, there’s a variety of situations where things could have gone drastically different.\n\n“My biggest, ‘what if’ would have to be what if Tegan Nox didn't get injured? That's my big one, because if that didn't happen, I don't know if Rhea Ripley would be here,” Ripley says.\n\nNox was Ripley’s opponent in the 2018 Mae Young Classic and expected to advance in the tournament. But after Nox tore major ligaments in her knee just minutes into their match, Ripley instead advanced in the bracket and went on to face Iyo Sky. Their match was a highlight-reel showcase and helped pave a path to the NXT UK Women’s title, the main roster, and eventual superstardom for Ripley.\n\nRipley has gone on to put together an exceptional career in the years since she burst onto the scene, winning multiple world championships and having exceptional matches that include Uncrowned’s 2025 Match of the Year against Sky and Belair at WrestleMania 41.\n\n“I love that match and I'm so glad that everyone else loved it just as much,\" Ripley says. \"For it to be Match of the Year for so many different outlets is just absolutely insane. For something that didn't have the best build to ‘Mania, but had such potential for us to go out there and be like the three from NXT, finally get to step into the ring, but at WrestleMania all together for the Women's World Championship, it just had so much meaning to all of us going in there.\n\n“Then for us to actually pull off such a caliber of a match was just absolute insanity. I remember being in that match and I remember so much about that match, and living in the moment and feeling that excitement from not only the crowd around me, but from everyone in the match too. We just knew it was special from the get-go pretty much. And to see it held at such a high caliber for everyone is just, it's insane. I'm very proud of that match, and honestly, it's probably one of my favorite matches that I've ever done.”\n\nFrom bitter, long-term rivals to now tag-team championship partners, Ripley is living in the moment alongside Sky. She admits they’ve “respected the hell out of each other since Day 1.”\n\n“There's always that respect there, but it's a competitive respect,” Ripley continues. “And we both feel it, and she rubs it in my face every now and then [that I haven't beaten her], and I can't blame her because I'd be doing the same. And the one time that I do finally beat her, I will be rubbing it in her face as well.”\n\nWhile Ripley is enjoying momentum in the tag-team division, it only feels like a matter of time before she’s back in the main-event scene.\n\nWill Saturday's Royal Rumble provide the perfect opportunity to catapult Ripley back to the title picture? She managed to go from number one to winning it all previously. At the same time, she’s having a ton of fun with Sky and acknowledges a return to a solo run would require a different Ripley than we’ve seen in recent months.\n\n“I am literally going out there and I'm cheesing because Iyo just makes me cheese, and I'm like, I don't know if I'm ready to be the serious Rhea again. Am I going to have to shift that drastically if I were to win the Royal Rumble? Which is something that obviously I want too, because I would love to go for the Women's World Championship again. And I've never wrestled Stephanie [Vaquer], and then also we have Jade Cargill,” Ripley says.\n\n“So it would be a happy feeling and a sad feeling. Especially because my dream is to also have that big singles match with Iyo again. And even though we're friends, I still want to beat her ass at one point.”\n\nFuture matches with the likes of Sky, Cargill and plenty of other challengers are there for the taking. But waiting for Ripley is what feels like an inevitable showdown with the current Women’s World Champion, Vaquer.\n\nRipley has been one of the shining stars to rise from NXT, elevated into arguably the face of the women’s division and one of the biggest stars on the roster. But Vaquer’s meteoric rise is a next-in-line situation that serves to challenge the standard Ripley has established as the top draw.\n\n“It's been crazy because she's moved through WWE so quickly, so extremely quickly. And to stand there as Women's World Champion and literally what, like a year ago she was still in NXT? That's nuts. That's unheard of. So I'm proud of how far she's got because that doesn't happen with everyone,” Ripley says.\n\n“That's very special talent that happens with. And I'm looking forward to the day that we do get to step in the ring together. I don't know when that day will be, but I am looking forward to it. I think that it's going to be a great challenge for me and our styles are different ... so I'm intrigued to see if we can make magic or not.”\n\nWith the likes of Vaquer, Trick Williams and the slew of young talent rising to the occasion, WWE is full of emerging names. It’s difficult to estimate which talent making the leap has the tools to become transcendent stars, to hold multiple world championships, and maybe even to eventually become a WWE 2K cover star.\n\n“Who do I see? Honestly there's so many. You never know what kind of year someone's going to have. So anything is really possible,” Ripley says when asked to predict who she thinks is a future cover star.\n\n“I know he just came back, but Austin Theory is such an amazing athlete and he's so good at what we do in this profession. So I'd like to see him on a cover at some point, I think that would be awesome. And then you see someone like even Bron Breakker, like the athleticism that man has is nuts. Literally he flies through the air, tackles someone and keeps flying. I don't know how that is a thing, I just don’t know how it's physically possible. And with The Vision and how that's all going with Bronson [Reed] in there too — I can see something happening with all that and maybe the whole group being on the cover as well, just like The Bloodline was. That could be really cool. So maybe those guys.”",

    "description": "Good ideas have no use as long as they remain ideas.",
    "fullText": "A longtime reader emails me every five years or so, to say that he still thinks of me every morning when he makes his bed. Back in 2009 I wrote a post about the psychological benefit of immediately making your bed when you wake up. (It’s an easy little mission that gets you shaping your day right away – a foolproof first move to carpe your diem.)\n\nThere’s a different reader I think of on a daily basis, one who invited me to visit him at his home in Norway. While I was there, he gave me an AeroPress coffeemaker and showed me his brewing method. After spilling hot coffee grounds all over his kitchen on my first attempt, I got the hang of it. I still think of him for a moment every single morning, when I stir the grounds with the bamboo stick he gave me.\n\nWhen I’m at the car wash, I always think of my dad, because he once said, “Nothing gets clean without the foamy brush.” I always use the foamy brush and my car always comes out looking great. It’s a bit of my dad’s insight living on in me, among many other bits.\n\nI like that things work this way. Ideas and ways of doing can zap between minds, and make a home in the new person. From there they can zap to other people’s minds and so on. After you die, someone may still be tying their shoes your way, or making chicken soup your way — maybe whole families of people, who knows.\n\nI publish blog posts here hoping that I can zap some of the best things I’ve discovered about being human into other people’s minds. I write weird posts about obscure mental practices because I want people to do them. If people do them, they might really get them, and if people get them, the ideas I’m trying to get across here can finally deliver their value.\n\nI want people to do these odd practices because the cost is so low compared to the benefit. Playing the secret ally to strangers, for example, takes thirty seconds of your attention here or there, and can transform your relationship to public spaces, strangers, and society as a whole. Imagining the disappearance of your friends (or your socks) for ten seconds can make almost any ordinary moment feel like a gift. That’s a very good deal! I want people to be doing this stuff after I’m dead and gone.\n\nDifferent people click with different ideas of course, but if you’re a regular reader, presumably you must believe there’s something actionable here for you, something you could pick up and make a part of your life.\n\nMany readers say they print out their favorite Raptitude posts, presumably in the hope that doing so will turn the initial spark of recognition, the feeling of “Hey, I should do that!” into a thing they actually do in their lives. The reader in Norway showed me a binder he made of some of my posts. A few people have mailed me copies of bound books they made from their favorites.\n\nI’m always printing out other people’s ideas too, hoping this will somehow make the epiphany permanent, that it will zap the idea into myself and make it a thing I do. If you do that too, you know that printing or highlighting some wise words doesn’t usually make them into a thing you actually do and live by. The books on my shelves are full of page tabs and underlined sentences that affected me when I read them, but few of them changed how I live.\n\nAn idea doesn’t do anything until it becomes actions. Printing an idea on paper makes it more tangible, but keeps it in idea form. Ultimately it has to leave the realm of words and get printed onto your motor neurons. If it doesn’t, the spark of insight fades and nothing comes of it.\n\nIn my experience, it works like this: if I act on an idea a few times – such as I have with Tolstoy’s do-your-25-miles-and-rest idea – and it pays off, there’s a good chance it will become a part of how I live. If I only read it and tape it to the wall, hoping to remember and act that way when it counts, it’s unlikely it will ever make it out of idea form.\n\nWith this in mind, I’ve been focusing on forming an active community around Raptitude. Instead of just broadcasting my ideas to the world, I’m getting people together to try them out in their lives, and talk about what happens when they do.\n\nI wish I’d made this a priority earlier. As you might know, my last experiment birthed an ongoing “Renunciation Club”, where people give things up for a month, breaking habits and forming new ones. (Go here if want to try that.)\n\nThere’s also been a lot of interest in the upcoming Raptitude Field Trip 2, which is great, because these virtual field trips are most direct way to discover what I’m really getting at with this blog.\n\nFor those who missed the first one, it’s where a bunch of readers take Raptitude practices “into the field” (i.e. your life) to see what happens. I give you easy how-to instructions, you go and try them, and (if you wish) report how it went in the forum.\n\nThey’re all simple perceptual exercises, having to do with how you meet your day-to-day experience. Most of them take less than one minute at a time, but they can change the tone of your day, and if you do them regularly they can improve whole areas of your life, as they have with mine.\n\nThe Field Trip is a fun and lightweight mini-course for helping people discover the hidden riches in day-to-day life, which is what this blog is all about. I try to keep the whole program about as cheap as ordering a large pizza.\n\nYou also get to chat with your fellow readers, who are a keen and helpful bunch. And me, I’m there too.\n\nYou can A few things to know:\n\n1. If you did participate in the previous Field Trip, this one is all-new. Same format, all new practices.\n\n2. The official start date will be February 10, and you can do it at your own pace.\n\n3. This isn’t a thing you need to schedule time for. The lessons are short and the practices take a minute or two here and there. You play with them when you’re out and about in the world.\n\n[What people said about the first Raptitude Field Trip]",

    "fullText": "Nicole Sperling and Brooks Barnes, reporting for The New York Times:\n\nAmazon paid Ms. Trump’s production company $40 million for the\nrights to “Melania,” about $26 million more than the next closest\nbidder, Disney. The fee includes a related docuseries that is\nscheduled to air later this year. The budget for “Melania” is\nunknown, but documentaries that follow a subject for a limited\namount of time usually cost less than $5 million to produce. The\n$35 million for marketing is 10 times what some other high-profile\ndocumentaries have received.\n\nAll of which has a lot of Hollywood questioning whether Amazon’s\npush is anything more than the company’s attempt to ingratiate\nitself with President Trump.\n\nThis is a good story, with multiple industry sources with experience making political documentaries, but the Times’s own subhead downplays Amazon’s spending on the film: “The tech giant is spending $35 million to promote its film about the first lady, far more than is typical for documentaries.” They’re spending $35 million now, to promote it, but they already paid $40 million for the rights to the film, $28 million of which is believed to have gone to Melania Trump herself. A $35 million total spend would be a lot compared to other high-profile documentaries, but it’s a $75 million total spend. This is not just a little fishy — it’s a veritable open air seafood market.\n\nTo grasp just how uncustomary Amazon’s marketing push for\n“Melania” is, consider how Magnolia Pictures handled “RBG,”\na portrait of Ruth Bader Ginsburg during her 25th year as a\nSupreme Court justice, in 2018.\n\nCNN Films produced “RBG” for around $1 million. The promotional\nbudget, including an awards campaign that helped it land two Oscar\nnominations, totaled about $3 million. The film debuted in 34\ntheaters and expanded into 432 locations over several weeks. It\nultimately collected $14 million, enough to rank as the year’s No.\n1 political documentary.\n\nOn Friday, “Melania” will also be released in 1,600 theaters\noverseas, where FilmNation, a New York company, is handling\ndistribution in more than 20 countries. International ticket sales\nare expected to be weak, according to box office analysts.\n\nDisplay Preferences",

    "fullText": "We’re excited to join Cursor, Cloudflare, Vercel, git-ai, Google Jules, Amp, OpenCode and others in support of Agent Trace. As described in the spec, Agent Trace is an open, vendor-neutral spec for recording AI contributions alongside human authorship in version-controlled codebases.\n\n(fun fact: above video was vibed in Windsurf entirely with the Remotion skill!)\n\nReductively, you can explain this as “a standard way to check in prompts with every commit”, but the spec is actually far more robust and thoughtfully designed than capturing just prompts.\n\nFoundation Capital recently wrote a viral piece on Context Graphs that they define as:\n\nGit was made in 2005 when the normal state of code collaboration was to email patches of code back and forth between developers. In other words, commits were expensive/bandwidth constrained, so we committed the bare minimum of what we could: line differences.\n\n20 years later, we have shifted from bandwidth constrained to context constrained. You -can- kloodge things by simply adding prompts as comments and checking them into git, but your code would soon be completely buried under a mountain of comments and your human and AI colleagues would hate you.\n\nInstead, Agent Trace does the smart thing - attribute each change (potentially a git commit, but potentially other more atomic changes) to the specific conversation and line ranges that were associated with that change:\n\nEvery one of us in the coding agents industry has independently developed a url identifier for the \"chat\" or \"conversation\" or \"trajectory\" (whatever you call it) where you can retrieve the (potentially long, potentially multimodal) context that would otherwise be impractical to store in an agent trace.\n\nThis one basic contract means that a repo with associated Agent Traces will always be able to link back to the context that created it. As a nice bonus, it helps keep PII and other sensitive information out of the agent trace store and top-level access for compatible coding agents that consume Agent Traces.\n\nTo jog your creativity, here are some of the internal tools we've already built that show what Agent Trace can unlock (all data is mock data unfortunately):\n\nFile Viewer that can attribute/blame AI vs Humans:\n\nPR-level breakdown of feature development\n\nNew interfaces for PR review (something we're VERY interested in) with full development context\n\nIn a scaled org with multiple coding agents and tools and humans all contributing code, you can imagine some pretty powerful management-level dashboards and data-driven decisions made once everyone outputs Agent Traces. Agent Traces make development legible.\n\nHowever we don't mean to cast Agent Traces as \"just use it so you know which AI to blame\" or \"just for pretty dashboards\".\n\nWith Agent Traced codebases, we think your agents will become a lot smarter and overall waste a lot less time spinning and reinventing wheels.\n\nIn 2025, the world learned that including the hidden reasoning artifacts and prior tool calls of models like GPT5 will lead to improvements in intelligence, reportedly by as much as 3 points in SWE-Bench (the difference between SOTA and meh) and cache hit rates improve by 40-80%.\n\nIn 2026, Agent Traces that progressively expose context to a coding agent that needs it, will lead to the same kind of performance improvements. In fact, because Agents spend so much more time in inference-time, the ability to retrieve specific context triggered by code will offer improvements not just in cost and accuracy, but also in wall-clock time wasted blindly repeating mistakes.\n\nContext is king. For the model labs, as it is for the agent labs.\n\nIf git tracked \"Lines of Code\" as the primary measure of output of the software engineer in the pre-AI era, then Agent Traces are the beginning of the new era when \"Lines of Code\" are the commodity, and the new precious resource is context. Whether or not you have 100% AI commits, your AI Engineers (human or otherwise) will spend the majority of their time crafting and reading context more than code.\n\nWe're excited to collaborate on a standard that moves the entire industry forward to meet that reality, and unlocks a new generation of AI-native developer tooling and coding agent capabilities that make use of them.",

    "fullText": "\"Writing about music is like dancing about architecture\" is a maxim used to express the futility of translating music through words.[1] It may be employed as an argument for dismissing music criticism altogether.[2]\n\nThe quote's origin is unknown. It is most commonly misattributed to musicians Laurie Anderson[3] and Elvis Costello.[4] Others, including Costello himself, credit the remark to comedian Martin Mull, although a variation (\"talking about music is like singing about economics\") has appeared in print since as early as 1918.[5]\n\nThe origins of the quote have never been verified. It has been attributed to musicians, entertainers, and writers such as William S. Burroughs, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Charles Mingus, Frank Zappa, George Carlin, Martin Mull, Lester Bangs, David Byrne, Steve Martin, Elvis Costello, and Laurie Anderson.[3][nb 1]\n\nOne of the earliest known usages of the phrase \"dancing about architecture\" appears in a 1979 Detroit Free Press magazine article, where it is attributed to Martin Mull, although this instance is predated by other print sources that contain similar expressions such as \"singing about economics\".[5] A 1918 New Republic article remarks,\n\nStrictly considered, writing about music is as illogical as singing about economics. All the other arts can be talked about in the terms of ordinary life and experience. A poem, a statue, a painting or a play is a representation of somebody or something, and can be measurably described (the purely aesthetic values aside) by describing what it represents.[8]\n\nThe maxim reappeared in a 1921 article penned by academic Winthrop Parkhurst, who wrote,\n\nLike the musical critic who lamented impotently that \"talking about music is like singing about economics,\" those musicians with a knack for literary expression may quite possibly be frightened off from a task which is reputed to be as arduous as turning \"Das Kapital\" into a song.[9]\n\nIn a 1983 interview, Elvis Costello responded to a question about his treatment in the music press by stating, in part,\n\nFraming all the great music out there only drags down its immediacy. The songs are lyrics, not speeches, and they're tunes, not paintings. Writing about music is like dancing about architecture—it's a really stupid thing to want to do.[2][10]\n\nCostello subsequently became widely identified with the quote. In a later interview, he denied having originated the phrase, adding with uncertainty that he may have gotten the line from Mull.[4] Laurie Anderson believed that the \"dancing about architecture\" saying had derived from Steve Martin.[3]\n\nMusic critic Robert Christgau responded to the maxim:\n\nOne of the many foolish things about the fools who compare writing about music to dancing about architecture is that dancing usually is about architecture. When bodies move in relation to a designed space, be it stage or ballroom or living room or gymnasium or agora or Congo Square, they comment on that space whether they mean to or not.[11]",

    "title": "Texas A&M Ends Women's Studies and Overhauls Classes Over Race and Gender",
    "description": "New policies limiting the teaching of race and gender issues led administrators and professors to change hundreds of courses. School leaders say the rules could hurt A&M’s reputation.",
    "fullText": "Texas A&M University said on Friday that it would end its women’s and gender studies program, and that the syllabuses for hundreds of courses had been altered under new policies limiting how race and gender ideology may be discussed in classrooms.\n\nThe university said that six courses had been canceled entirely because of the new rules, out of the roughly 5,400 that were planned for this semester at one of the nation’s largest public universities.\n\nThe A&M system’s regents — all of them appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican — approved the restrictive policies late last year, and officials have been scrambling since then to interpret and enforce them. Supporters contend that the rules are appropriate measures to prevent political ideologies, especially those often associated with the left, from entering classrooms. Opponents say the approach encourages self-censorship and is itself ideological.\n\nA top-down demand to scrutinize a university’s entire course catalog in so short a time is extraordinarily rare in the United States, where professors have long had sweeping control over their syllabuses.\n\n“I have never seen anything like this,” said Leonard Bright, a professor in A&M’s Bush School of Government and Public Service and the president of the American Association of University Professors chapter in College Station, where the A&M system has its flagship campus of more than 74,000 students.\n\nThe regents do not seem interested in the academic freedom of students and the faculty, he added, only the “freedom of their speech.”\n\nFriday’s announcement about shutting down the university’s women’s and gender studies program went beyond the immediate repercussions that many people had anticipated.\n\nTommy Williams, the university’s interim president, said in a statement that he had directed the closure because of low enrollment and “the difficulty of bringing the program in compliance with the new system policies.” He said that students who were already pursuing degrees or certificates in the program would be able to complete them.\n\nIn 2024, the regents ordered A&M to drop its minor in L.G.B.T.Q. studies. But ending a full bachelor’s degree program represents a sharp escalation in the debate over what should be taught at public universities in Texas, the nation’s most populous conservative state.\n\nA&M is not the first school to drop gender studies. New College of Florida, for example, moved in 2023 to shut down its program, which had operated for decades.\n\nUntil Friday, discussions at A&M had often focused on how individual courses this semester would be affected by the new limits, which Mr. Williams argued in an interview this week had “restored rigor into some areas where maybe we had had some drift.”\n\n“This has given us a transparent way to go through and make sure that what we’re advertising the course is about is actually what’s being taught,” he said on Tuesday, adding that the approach “strengthens academic integrity, it protects our academic standards and, I think, most importantly, it builds trust in higher education.”\n\nA&M officials have nevertheless been bracing for recriminations, including possible court challenges, and for prospective students or professors to be thinking twice about heading to College Station.\n\n“It’s been harmful to our reputation, there’s no question about that,” said Mr. Williams, a Republican former state legislator. “But I think it’s transitory.”\n\nMr. Williams, who previously worked for Mr. Abbott, said he had not discussed the policies with the governor. And during the interview, Mr. Williams did not mention any plans concerning the women’s and gender studies program, which currently has 28 students enrolled in its major.\n\nUnder the new systemwide policies, no A&M course may “advocate race or gender ideology, or topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity.” Certain classes that are not part of the core curriculum may include teaching about those subjects, but only if a campus president agrees that there is “a necessary educational purpose.”\n\nAsked whether any part of him believed that the policies went too far, Mr. Williams replied, “No.” Pressed on whether deans and department heads would share that view, Mr. Williams responded, “Some would and some would not.”\n\nFor the most part, those deans and department heads have been the ones trying to navigate how far A&M should go in excising content.\n\n“Day by day, we began to have a clearer understanding of where the line may be,” said Simon North, the interim dean of the College of Arts and Sciences in College Station.\n\nDr. North acknowledged, though, that it was impossible to know exactly how many courses had been affected because some faculty members may have modified their syllabuses themselves.\n\n“There are actions that people took in consultation with us,” Dr. North said, “and there are actions that people may have done on their own.”\n\nSyllabus reviews largely took place at the departmental and college levels, but some reached the interim president’s desk. As he prepared this week to weigh requests for exemptions, Mr. Williams said that “common sense is what we’re trying to use as our gauge.”\n\nHe said that A&M officials were not looking to cut material in ways that might prevent students from being competitive in the marketplace, and that opponents of the new rules had “confused what academic freedom is.”\n\n“It doesn’t mean you get to do whatever you want to in the classroom,” he said. “You have academic freedom, but it comes along with the responsibility, and part of that responsibility is to make sure that the learning outcomes are achieved and they’re done in a way that’s compliant with state and federal law and what our regents mandate us to do.”\n\nEven before the wholesale course review, Texas A&M was debating what content was appropriate in college classrooms. In September, the university fired a lecturer for displaying a gender unicorn — which is used to explain the differences between gender expression and gender identity — during a course on children’s literature. The president of the university at the time — Mr. Williams’s predecessor — quickly stepped down.\n\nA faculty appeals panel ruled that the university was “not justified” when it ousted the lecturer, Melissa McCoul, but A&M has refused to reinstate her.\n\nThen the regents’ policies deepened the turmoil. One of the largest ruptures unspooled in the philosophy department, after a professor, Martin Peterson, proposed including portions of Plato’s Symposium in a contemporary moral issues course that can be used to fulfill a core curriculum requirement.\n\nHe also scheduled teaching modules covering race and gender ideology. He had discussed similar topics in the course in the past, though previous syllabuses showed that the modules had different names, like “race and gender issues.”\n\nKristi Sweet, the head of the philosophy department, asked him to “mitigate” the course to remove that content, or face reassignment to a different class. After the dispute became public, university officials repeatedly suggested that Dr. Peterson had constructed his syllabus as a provocation.\n\nDr. Peterson acknowledged that he had wanted to “test the waters,” but he said in an interview this week that he thought the Platonic passages would be less contentious than material he had assigned in the past: an excerpt from the Supreme Court ruling that recognized a right to same-sex marriage. He has since replaced the disputed modules and Plato readings with lessons about academic freedom.\n\nAdministrators note that Plato appears in the syllabuses for other classes.\n\n“Hundreds of Aggies are reading Plato in their courses right now,” Dr. Sweet said. She added that the entirety of Plato’s Symposium was being taught in the Philosophy of Art course, and that despite a wide outcry over its handling of the Peterson class, the department’s “strategic priorities for continued excellence are untouched by current events.”\n\nDr. Bright, the A.A.U.P. chapter president, has faced questions about his own courses. Administrators initially flagged an article that included discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity. But the dean of the Bush School, John Sherman, told Dr. Bright that administrators would support letting him use that text, “given the scholarly nature of the work and the applicability of the reading.”\n\nAnother of Dr. Bright’s courses worried administrators more.\n\nDr. Bright wrote that the course would examine the impact of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation and other social identities “on public policy and the professional ethical responsibilities of public servants.”\n\nDr. Sherman asked him how sexual orientation would be covered. After Dr. Bright responded that it was impossible to say exactly when the subject might come up in a discussion-driven course, the dean canceled the class.\n\n“To say this gives me no pleasure is an understatement,” Dr. Sherman wrote. “To be clear, transparency does not equate to censorship.”\n\nDr. Bright said that university leaders had made an impossible demand about a course that is often shaped by current events.\n\nIt is rare for university governing boards to make decisions that reach so far into classrooms so quickly. Still, R. Bowen Loftin, a former A&M president, said there were few practical options available to campus officials who might disagree with the regents.\n\n“When you become an administrator, especially at a public institution, there’s going to be limits on what you can say and what you can do, and you have to come to grips with that,” he said.\n\nDr. North, the arts and sciences dean, said “questions of academic freedom and academic responsibilities are really difficult,” but that he was “trying to implement these changes in a way that puts students first and supports faculty.”\n\nDr. Bright showed little patience with such defenses.\n\n“When it comes to certain things, you’ve got to say no,” he said. “I don’t excuse administrators from that responsibility.”",

The truck struck the passenger side, hitting Matteo.\n\nThe second grader at Prairie View Elementary School in Northwest ISD lost his pulse at the scene.\n\nFirst responders were able to revive him, and he was airlifted to Cook Children’s Medical Center. However, Matteo died during the flight.\n\n“At first I was shocked,” his mother said. “I was like, no. Don’t say that.”\n\nShe said Matteo’s grandmother immediately blamed herself.\n\n“She said, ‘I killed your son,’” Matteo’s mother said. “She blamed herself from the very first moment.”\n\nNow, Matteo’s mother is pushing for change at the intersection where her son was killed. She has launched a Change.org petition calling on the Texas Department of Transportation to install a traffic signal at the busy crossing. As of this week, the petition has gathered more than 9,000 signatures.\n\nWhen asked if a traffic light could have made a difference, she did not hesitate.\n\n“Yes,” she said. “Totally. With all my heart.”\n\nWFAA reached out to TxDOT about the incident, but has not received a response.\n\nMatteo’s mother is a Kindergarten teacher at his elementary school. She said her last moments with him were simple and joyful.\n\nA student had gifted her a small ladybug stuffed animal, and Matteo was excited to take it home.\n\n“I told him, remember you have the ladybug,” she said. “Put it in your backpack so we can bring it back tomorrow. He left so happy.”\n\nAfter Matteo died, she noticed something that stopped her.\n\n“When I entered the hospital room, he had the ladybug on his shoulder,” she said. “The ladybug came back to me, but not him.”\n\nMatteo was her youngest child, born after she suffered a miscarriage.\n\n“They ripped part of my heart,” she said. “I won’t be able to see my kid graduate.”\n\nDespite the grief, she says she will keep pushing for change, hoping Matteo’s story leads to action and saves lives.\n\n“I don’t want another family to go through this,” she said.",

    "description": "Tesla's car sales dropped 11% while Elon Musk pivots to unproven robots, losing the EV crown to BYD as investors question the risky strategy.",
    "fullText": "Tesla’s car business just posted its first-ever annual revenue decline, but Elon Musk claims salvation lies in robots that don’t exist yet. The company’s Q4 2025 earnings revealed a brutal reality: automotive revenues plummeted 11% year-over-year to $69.53 billion, while total vehicle deliveries dropped 8.6% to 1.636 million units. Meanwhile, BYD cruised past Tesla as the world’s top EV maker, selling 2.26 million vehicles compared to Tesla’s shrinking numbers.\n\nThe most telling stat? Europe, where Tesla’s sales cratered 37.2%—the worst performance among all automakers, even as the broader EV market grew. Your Tesla stock might have rebounded 4% post-earnings, but that’s mainly because Musk spent the call talking about anything except cars.\n\nMusk positions Tesla as a “physical AI company” banking on unproven robotics technology.\n\nInstead of addressing why customers increasingly choose cheaper alternatives, Musk doubled down on his AI pivot. Tesla pumped $2 billion into his separate venture xAI, promising mysterious “collaboration frameworks.” The star of this show? Optimus humanoid robots, which Musk claims will enter production before 2026 ends and reach public sales by 2027.\n\nHe’s calling it the “biggest product ever” with poverty-ending potential—basically the tech equivalent of promising world peace through household appliances. The Robotaxi program, once Tesla’s golden ticket to autonomy riches, has quietly stalled. Those “unsupervised” tests that generated headlines? They’ve vanished faster than a TikTok trend.\n\nDeclining sales across all markets expose the risks of chasing sci-fi dreams over current products.\n\nYour Cybertruck enthusiasm apparently wasn’t shared—sales dropped 48% as the angular pickup failed to capture mainstream appeal. “2025 marks the year Tesla lost the BEV crown to BYD… a 620,000-unit gap,” noted Howard Yu from IMD Business School.\n\nThis pivot represents Silicon Valley’s ultimate moonshot mentality: when your core business falters, promise revolutionary technology that’s perpetually “just around the corner.” Tesla’s betting shareholders will stay patient while competitors like BYD offer reliable, affordable EVs today. Whether Musk’s robot army materializes or becomes another Hyperloop-level distraction remains the trillion-dollar question keeping investors awake at night.\n\nFrom the coolest cars to the must-have gadgets, GadgetReview’s daily newsletter keeps you in the know.

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A man who drove his car into the Chabad Lubavitch world headquarters in New York City had recently been trying to connect with the Hasidic Jewish community and was recorded on video enthusiastically dancing with congregants during a recent visit to the site, police said.\n\nInvestigators were still trying to piece together what prompted the man, Dan Sohail, 36, to ram his car repeatedly into a set of doors at the revered Hasidic Jewish center in Brooklyn on Wednesday night, but police charged him Thursday with attempted assault as a hate crime, based on the fact that the building was a Jewish institution.\n\n“Earlier this month, Sohail attended a social gathering at this very same location,” New York Police Department Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said at a news conference, noting there was video circulating online of that gathering.\n\nThe video appears to show Sohail dancing with Orthodox men inside the headquarters.\n\n“We believe that he was in Brooklyn last night to continue this attempt to connect with the Lubavitch Jewish community,\" Kenny said.\n\nSohail told police that he lost control of his car because he was wearing “clunky boots,” Kenny said, though Kenny added that Sohail had removed several blockades and cleared snow away from a sidewalk before driving into the building.\n\nThe complex at 770 Eastern Parkway includes a synagogue and offices, and was packed with worshippers at the time, but no one was injured. Some of the building’s doors were damaged. No weapons were discovered in Sohail’s car.\n\nSohail's father told the New York Daily News Thursday that his son had been considering converting to Judaism and that he had struggled with “mental problems.” The Forward, a media outlet centered on Jewish issues, interviewed a rabbi in New Jersey who said Sohail attended a Purim service at Chabad last year and visited two other times, looking for spiritual guidance.\n\n“I was able to talk to him for a few minutes and see that he’s not exactly stable,” Rabbi Levi Azimov told the Forward. Another rabbi at a Jewish school in Carteret, New Jersey, where Sohail lived, told the Forward he had dropped by for afternoon prayers on Tuesday but began yelling about feeling let down by Chabad after the service.\n\nThe crash occurred on the 75th anniversary of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson becoming the leader of the Lubavitch movement and prompted immediate concern in the city. Mayor Zohran Mamdani and the city's police commissioner, Jessica Tisch, rushed to the scene to brief the media, with officials announcing increased security around houses of worship across the city.\n\n“This is deeply alarming, especially given the deep meaning and the history of the institution to so many in New York and around the world,\" Mamdani said. “And on today of all days.”\n\nThe Chabad Lubavitch headquarters and synagogue in Brooklyn draws thousands of visitors each year. There is a near constant police presence around the complex.",

    "fullText": "Long-term Bitcoin holders are selling a lot right now, putting downward pressure on the price.\n\nThe market has absorbed much of this selling so far, with big buyers stepping in to support it.\n\nA full crash is unlikely in the near term, but Bitcoin could still drop further if selling continues.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has started 2026 on shaky ground, grinding between $88,000 and $90,000 after falling hard from its $124,000 peak.\n\nAs the market searches for a clear direction, one storyline is dominating the conversation.\n\nLong-term Bitcoin holders (LTHs)—investors who have held BTC for at least 155 days—may be starting to sell in size.\n\nIf that trend holds, it could add fresh pressure to an already fragile market and fuel fears that a deeper pullback is still ahead.\n\nAccording to Glassnode data, Bitcoin long-term holders are dumping BTC faster than during the October 2025 crash.\n\nOver the past 30 days, these LTHs have sold approximately 143,000 BTC, valued at around $9.5 billion at current prices.\n\nThis marks the fastest pace of divestment since August 2025, reversing a brief accumulation phase from late December 2025 to early January 2026.\n\nGlassnode’s data shows that mid-term holders (1-5 years) are still offloading supply, while longer-term holders (over 5 years) show signs of stabilization or even minor accumulation.\n\nFor instance, the BTC supply that has been inactive for over five years increased by 95,500 coins in the last month, suggesting that not all veteran holders are panicking.\n\nHowever, this selling adds supply to the market and puts downward pressure on prices.\n\nCryptoQuant echoes this, noting that LTH sales began when prices surpassed $40,000, distinguishing this cycle from previous bull markets where holders were more steadfast.\n\nBitcoin’s price weakness isn’t isolated to LTH behavior. Over 22% of BTC supply is held at a loss, a level last seen in early 2022 and mid-2018, heightening sensitivity to further declines.\n\nShort-term holders (STHs), who are price-sensitive, are particularly vulnerable; their spent output profit ratio sits at 0.99, just below breakeven, suggesting potential capitulation if support breaks.\n\nGlassnode warned that failure to hold key levels, such as the -1 standard deviation of the STH cost basis or the true market mean, could resume LTH selling.\n\nMacro factors add layers of complexity to the current bearish market trends.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged despite a depleting dollar.\n\nInstitutional inflows via spot ETFs have been mixed, with $1.3 billion in outflows recently, yet firms like Strategy have absorbed over 40,000 BTC in 2026 alone.",

    "fullText": "MUMBAI, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Some of the world's biggest reinsurers, including Lloyd's of London, are seeking Indian regulatory approval to operate in a low-tax city set up in the prime minister's home state ​to try to rival other international financial hubs, two sources said.\n\nThe global companies, which also include South Korea’s Samsung Re, ‌Kenya Re and Spain’s Mapfre Re, will join more than a dozen global reinsurers from Europe, the Middle East and Asia that are turning to the new city to ‌gain access to India's $129.78 billion insurance market, estimated by the industry to be the tenth largest in the world.\n\nThe two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the press, said the companies were expected to seek approval this year.\n\nEmail queries sent to Mapfre Re, Samsung Re and Kenya Re were not answered. A Lloyd’s of London spokesperson declined to comment. The companies' plans to ⁠set up operations in the Gujarat International Finance ‌Tec‑City, or GIFT City, have not been previously reported.\n\nThe city offers businesses favourable tax treatment, such as a 10-year tax holiday and exemption from capital gains.\n\nThe government has said it hopes it will rival Singapore and ‍Dubai as an international financial centre.\n\nIndia's reinsurance market is currently dominated by Swiss Re and Munich Re, as well as private firms and the government-owned GIC Re that is widely expected to grow after the government introduced reforms to deepen India's insurance penetration.\n\nSAUDI RE AND OTHERS HAVE RECEIVED APPROVAL\n\nA few large ​reinsurers have received approvals over the last year to begin operating in GIFT City. These include Saudi Re, Korean Re, Peak Re, ‌Kuwait Re, Abu Dhabi National Insurance and Kazakh‑based Eurasia Insurance Company JSC, according to regulatory officials and company statements.\n\nSaudi Re earlier this week opened its GIFT City branch, its second in Asia after Malaysia.\n\nKorean Re has said its expansion reflected its commitment to India’s high growth insurance sector, while Hong Kong‑based Peak Re, which received a licence in March 2025, said it plans to offer life and non-life insurance.\n\nAbout 14 global reinsurers operate from GIFT City, managing an annualised $700–800 million in premiums, public disclosures show.\n\nThe number of reinsurers is expected to increase ⁠to at least 20 by the end of March 2026, two regulatory officials ​said, declining to be identified as final approvals are pending.\n\nThey said the international reinsurers ​sought to offer products that are relatively underdeveloped in India, including surety bonds, parametric insurance, marine and shipping cover, cyber risk and health reinsurance.",

    "description": "Two 7,000-year-old mummies from the Takarkori rock shelter in the Sahara have been found to be from a group with a previously unknown ancestry.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nTwo 7,000-year-old mummies from the Takarkori rock shelter in the Sahara have been found to be from a group with a previously unknown ancestry.\n\nDNA analysis of the mummies, which are the remains of female herders from a time when the Sahara was more humid and known as the Green Sahara, did not show the expected Sub-Saharan genes.\n\nThe Takarkori individuals are most closely related to other North African peoples who diverged from Sub-Saharan populations long before.\n\nWhile the Sahara is now a vast expanse of sand where the fight for survival can be brutal, there was a time (however difficult that is to believe) when it was actually green and flourishing.\n\nBetween 14,800 and 5,500 years ago, during what is known as the African Humid Period, the desert known for being one of the driest places on Earth actually had enough water to support a way of life. Back then, it was a savannah that early human populations settled in to take advantage of the favorable farming conditions. Among them was a mysterious people who lived in what is now southwestern Libya and should have been genetically Sub-Saharan—except, upon a modern analysis, their genes didn’t reflect that.\n\nLed by archaeogeneticist Nada Salem from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, a team of researchers analyzed the genes of two 7,000-year-old naturally preserved mummies of Neolithic female herders from the Takarkori rock shelter. Though genetic material does not preserve well in arid climates, which is why much about ancient human populations in the Sahara remains a mystery, there was enough fragmented DNA to give insights into their past.\n\n“The majority of Takarkori individuals’ ancestry stems from a previously unknown North African genetic lineage that diverged from sub-Saharan African lineages around the same time as present-day humans outside Africa and remained isolated throughout most of its existence,” they said in a study recently published in Nature.\n\nThe Takarkori individuals are actually close relatives of 15,000-year-old foragers from Taforalt Cave in Morocco. Both lineages have about the same genetic distance from Sub-Saharan groups that existed during that period, which suggests that there was not much gene flow between Sub-Saharan and Northen Africa at the time. The Taforalt people also have half the Neanderthal genes of non-Africans, while the Takarkori have ten times less. What is strange is that they still have more Neanderthal DNA than other sub-Saharan peoples who were around at the time.\n\nWhile the Takarkori apparently had less contact with Neanderthals than the Taforalt, they must have somehow had more contact than other groups in their region. There are also traces of evidence for admixture with farmers from the Levant. Otherwise, the genes of the Takarkori reveal them to have been mostly isolated. They were genetically close to Northwestern African foragers such as the Taforalt but otherwise distinct from Sub-Saharan populations.\n\nThis can only mean that there was not much genetic exchange in the Green Sahara during the African Humid Period. It used to be thought that farming practices spread through the region by migrations. Salem’s team has another explanation.\n\n“Our findings suggest that pastoralism spread through cultural diffusion into a deeply divergent, isolated North African lineage that had probably been widespread in Northern Africa during the late Pleistocene epoch,” they said in the same study.\n\nIt seems that farming spread through the exchange of practices between cultures rather than admixture resulting from migrations. The Takarkori are thought to have inherited their genes from a hunter-gatherer group that was around during a period before animals were domesticated and farming began. Despite being hunter-gatherers, the ancestors of the Takarkori made advances in the manufacture of pottery, baskets, and tools made of wood and bone. They also stayed in one place for longer periods of time.\n\nThe reason the Takarkori stayed isolated probably has to do with the diversity of environments in the Green Sahara. These ranged from lakes and wetlands to woodlands to grasslands, savannas and even mountains. Such differences in habitats were barriers to interaction between human populations.\n\nSomewhere in the sands of the Sahara and the sands of time, there might be hidden mummies or artifacts waiting to tell us more about what life was like in the desert before it dried out.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage and refinance rates stepped higher for the week as the Federal Reserve announced a pause from rate cuts. According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose one basis point to 6.10%. Meanwhile, the 15-year rate gained five basis points to 5.49%. Still, the 30-year loan remains near a three-year low.\n\nDiscover the best mortgage refinance lenders\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nHere are 8 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rate possible.\n\nHere are today's mortgage refinance interest rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAs with mortgage rates for purchase, these are national averages that we've rounded to the nearest hundredth. Refinance rates can be higher than purchase mortgage rates, but that isn't always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. Be sure to use the dropdown to include private mortgage insurance costs and HOA dues if they apply to you. These monthly expenses, along with your mortgage principal and interest rate, will give you a realistic idea of what your monthly payment could be.\n\nA mortgage interest rate is the fee charged by a lender for borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. There are two basic types of mortgage rates: fixed and adjustable rates.\n\nA fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you get a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will remain at 6% for the entire 30 years. (Unless you refinance or sell the home.)\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for the first few years, then changes it periodically. Let’s say you get a 5/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first five years, and then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 25 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and the U.S. housing market.\n\nAt the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. As time passes, less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed.\n\nLearn how to choose between an adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nTwo categories determine mortgage rates: those you can control and those you cannot.\n\nWhat factors can you control? First, you can compare the best mortgage lenders to find the one that gives you the lowest rate and fees.\n\nSecond, lenders typically extend lower rates to people with higher credit scores, lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and considerable down payments. If you can save more or pay down debt before securing a mortgage, a lender will probably give you a better interest rate.\n\nWhat factors can you not control? In short, the economy.\n\nThe list of ways the economy impacts mortgage rates is long, but here are the basic details. If the economy — for example, employment rates — is struggling, mortgage rates decrease to encourage borrowing, which helps boost the economy. If the economy is strong, mortgage rates go up to temper spending.\n\nWith all other factors being equal, mortgage refinance rates are typically slightly higher than purchase rates. So don't be surprised if your refinance rate is higher than you may have expected.\n\nTwo of the most common mortgage terms are 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages. Both lock in your rate for the entire loan term.\n\nA 30-year mortgage is popular because it has relatively low monthly payments. But it comes with a higher interest rate than shorter terms, and because you’re accumulating interest for three decades, you’ll pay a lot of interest in the long run.\n\nA 15-year mortgage can be a good choice because it has a lower rate than you’ll get with longer terms, so you’ll pay less in interest over the years. You’ll also pay off your mortgage much faster. But your monthly payments will be higher because you’re paying off the same loan amount in half the time.\n\nBasically, 30-year mortgages are more affordable from month to month, while 15-year mortgages are cheaper in the long run.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance's weekly survey of lenders with the lowest rates, some of the banks with the lowest median mortgage rates are Chase and Citibank. However, it's a good idea to shop around for the best rate, not just with banks, but also with credit unions and companies specializing in mortgage lending.\n\nYes, 2.75% is an amazing mortgage rate. You're unlikely to get a 2.75% rate in today's market unless you take on an assumable mortgage from a seller who locked in this rate in 2020 or 2021, when rates were at all-time lows.\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the lowest-ever 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 2.65%. This was the national average in January 2021. It is extremely unlikely that rates will dip below 3% again anytime soon.\n\nSome experts say it's worth refinancing when you can lock in a rate that's 2% less than your current mortgage rate. Others say 1% is the magic number. It all depends on your financial goals when refinancing, how long you plan to stay in the same house, and on your break-even point after paying the refinance closing costs.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction. Choose the best mortgage lender for your needs.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nTo refinance a mortgage with bad credit, look into streamline refinancing, adding a co-signer, plus other options. Learn which refi strategy makes sense for you.\n\nMortgage rates are down, so refinancing soon could be a good idea. Here's what you should know if you want to refinance your mortgage loan in early 2026.\n\nYou can usually refinance your mortgage with the same bank or lender, but you don’t have to. Learn the pros and cons of using the same lender.",

Sometimes, she does Pilates. Other times, she visits the gym, and most recently, she started working with a personal trainer.\n\nNo matter the workout, she's almost always wearing Alo Yoga clothes. She said its pieces are cute and comfortable.\n\nBarden specifically loves the brand's $138 sweatpants and $148 quarter-zip pullover from its Accolade collection, as well as the $78 bra and $134 leggings from its Airlift line.\n\nOccasionally, though, she'll swap her Alo pants for Lululemon's $108 Align leggings.\n\nVictoria Villanueva, 25, cofounded LuxeHaus Management with Barden. She said that exercise is vital to staying active and boosting her mental health while working from home.\n\n\"I've been really into bike riding lately,\" she said. \"I used to go all the time with my dad when I was little, and getting back into it now as an adult is healing something inside me. It's better than taking walks.\"\n\nTo hydrate before and after those rides, she relies on her $40 Stanley 1913 tumbler.\n\nVillanueva told Business Insider that her exercise wardrobe includes a mix of Halara leggings, Fabletics sets, and one accessory: the $349 Ultrahuman Ring Air in bionic gold.\n\n\"It's a dupe for the Oura Ring, but you don't have to pay for a monthly subscription,\" she said.\n\nIt helps her track her steps, heart rate, sleep, and more.\n\nSabrina Guler is the 32-year-old founder of Intuitive CEO, an advisory studio that helps new brands grow and raise capital.\n\nHer exercise regimen starts before she really gets moving each day.\n\n\"Drinking electrolytes before coffee every morning has completely changed my energy levels and hydration,\" she said. \"I avoid sugar-based options and use Ultima electrolytes.\"\n\nThe brand sells packets in sets for around $20.99 per bag.\n\n\"My 45-minute morning walk helps with insulin regulation, cortisol balance, and mental clarity,\" Guler told Business Insider. \"Hormones are everything.\"\n\nThe specific clothing pieces she wears on those walks might vary, but the brands don't.\n\n\"If I want to be seen and look cute, I am wearing Alo Yoga,\" she said. \"If I want to be comfortable, Lululemon has functional pieces. The butter-soft leggings still have me in a chokehold years later.\"\n\nNikki Seaman, 30, is the founder and CEO of Freestyle Snacks. Her brand, which recently appeared on \"Shark Tank,\" offers premium olives and pickles in to-go pouches.\n\n\"I do strength training two or three times a week, and I try to walk outside on the other days,\" she told Business Insider. \"I started strength training after my first son was born, and it has totally changed me physically and mentally.\"\n\nDuring those workouts, she wears $110 performance joggers from Vuori and $155 Clifton 10 sneakers from Hoka.\n\nShe described both as comfortable, durable, and easy to throw on before heading outside.",

    "fullText": "More than 10 years after its delivery, warnings from Donald Trump’s June 2015 presidential candidacy announcement continue to resonate. He decried the high cost of the Affordable Care Act medical insurance subsidies. He sounded a warning about the federal debt, then at $18 trillion, calling $24 trillion in debt the point of no return.\n\nAbout 15 months later, beginning with speeches in October 2016, he added a third dire warning about Washington’s entrenched bureaucracy. His call for a Constitutional amendment for term limits on Congress, and his phrase “drain the swamp,” drew huge positive reaction to crowds attending campaign rallies.\n\nAs this month ends, a cataclysmic controversy over the Dept. of Homeland Security threatens another partial government shutdown. The federal debt sits at more than $38.5 trillion. Despite the efforts of DOGE and actions which have dismantled some parts of government, such as the Department of Education — entrenched bureaucrats still hold massive power in and around the Beltway.\n\nAnother paralyzing problem is the vexing overreach of the judiciary. According to the non-profit Lawfare, there are now 253 active court cases challenging Trump’s administration actions as president. And although Supreme Court rulings have frequently favored Trump, liberal judges continue handing down injunctions to block his executive policies and orders.\n\nAdd to this an unprecedented degree of uncertainty about the 2026 midterm elections. More than 50 frustrated Senators and Congressmen, many of them Republicans, are choosing not to seek re-election. Most recent polling gives Democrats a 5-point advantage in the coming midterms, and the party occupying the White House historically loses 20 to 25 Congressional seats in the midterm terms.\n\nIf Democrats win back the House, another Trump impeachment is likely. The political landscape in 2027 and 2028 could become far more murky and less favorable to Trump than it is now.\n\nBut there is one way that Trump could do an end-around on all this and provide the nation a huge, maybe even transformational benefit in the process. Staying true to his roots and his campaign rhetoric dating back to 2015, Trump could announce in 2026 that he is now advocating for a convention of states under Article V of the U.S. Constitution, to adopt changes in how Washington works.\n\nSpecifically, he’d seek congressional term limits (something 87 percent of the public supports), a balanced budget amendment (something 49 of our 50 states already have), and limitations on the power of the judiciary.\n\nAll three of these are perfectly consistent with what Trump believes and has campaigned upon ever since he first tossed his hat into the presidential ring 11 years ago.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, Trump’s involvement could ensure success of the movement working toward holding such a convention of states. Under Article V, the legislatures of 34 states must pass resolutions in order to hold it. There are 20 states which have already agreed to the measure. Trump carried 31 states in the 2024 presidential election. Of these, 17 have not yet approved the resolution.\n\nIf Trump backs the measure and campaigns for an Article V convention, many of these 17 states would certainly get on board.\n\nTrump’s involvement would also ensure success due to one other factor: growing public disenchantment with the status quo. About 80 percent of Americans feel the nation is in a political crisis. The current upheaval over internal immigration enforcement and campaigning in the midterms will only serve to exacerbate that sentiment.\n\nThe best legacy Trump can leave America on its 250th anniversary is to reform the status quo once and for all. And the only way to achieve that is through the Convention of States process.\n\nJohn Kerezy is an associate professor at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland.",

    "description": "SpaceX and OpenAI and their leaders, Elon Musk and Sam Altman, are among tech's biggest figures. Both could IPO in 2026.",
    "fullText": "It looks like 2026 could be a banger year for IPOs.\n\nAfter a slowdown in blockbuster public debuts, two of the most closely watched private tech companies are expected to go public this year: SpaceX and OpenAI.\n\nWhile reports last year suggested both companies would go public in 2026, recent developments have fueled speculation about when and how it could happen.\n\nAlso on Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported OpenAI was planning for an IPO in the fourth quarter as it races to beat Anthropic, an AI competitor, to market.\n\nHere's what smart people in tech and business are saying about the potential IPOs of two of the world's most valuable private companies.\n\nChamath Palihapitiya, a prominent venture capitalist and former Facebook exec, said, \"A merger between SpaceX and Tesla would instantly create the Berkshire Hathaway of the modern century.\"\n\n\"The capital raising and operational efficiencies if both were together are obvious,\" Palihapitiya wrote on X. \"If this were to happen, it would also bring us one step closer to having one equity instrument for all things Elon, which many would want to buy.\"\n\nA merger between SpaceX and Tesla would instantly create the Berkshire Hathaway of the modern century.The capital raising and operational efficiencies if both were together are obvious. If this were to happen, it would also bring us one step closer to having one equity…\n\nEric Berger, the senior space editor at Ars Technica, said talks of a merger between SpaceX and xAI shouldn't be a \"huge surprise.\"\n\n\"If you believe AI is the future; and that compute is the major problem to solve; and orbital data centers are feasible—then the combined company would be a vertically integrated AI colossus,\" he wrote on X.\n\nThe reported merger talks between SpaceX and xAI should not come as a huge surprise. If you believe AI is the future; and that compute is the major problem to solve; and orbital data centers are feasible—then the combined company would be a vertically integrated AI colossus.\n\nNoah Smith, a former Bloomberg journalist who now writes a popular economics substack, shared his concerns over OpenAI's future success in a post titled \"What if AI succeeds but OpenAI fails?\"\n\nAn OpenAI IPO will raise \"many more billions in cash, this time from regular investors,\" said Smith, but Sam Altman's company could be \"an early leader that flames out.\"\n\n\"Even if AI technology and the AI industry as a whole succeed wildly, OpenAI might not be the company that wins the race. That could leave a lot of investors holding the bag,\" he said.\n\n\"It could also cause a temporary — but unwarranted — chill in AI investment in the US, allowing Chinese companies to take the lead.\"\n\nRoss Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, told The Information that he would not purchase SpaceX stock if the company goes public.\n\nSpaceX is \"not really a great business in the sense of profitability,\" said Gerber. \"To pay a trillion and a half dollars for a space company that does $15 billion in revenue is just insanity.\"\n\n\"If you're going to pay 2x or 3x just because it's Elon's company, I wish you the best of luck, and it's not something I am going to do,\" he said.",

    "description": "SpaceX is gearing up for a massive IPO this year, and multiple reports suggested the rocket giant is considering mergers with Tesla or xAI.",
    "fullText": "The \"Muskonomy\" might be about to get a lot more complicated.\n\nSpaceX is gearing up for a potential $1.5 trillion IPO this year, and multiple reports on Thursday night suggested the rocket company is considering blockbuster mergers with Tesla, Elon Musk's carmaker, or his AI startup, xAI.\n\nThe three companies have already been moving closer together in recent months. Tesla said on Wednesday that it had invested $2 billion in xAI, after SpaceX reportedly made a similar investment last year.\n\nThe electric carmaker also told investors it would evaluate \"potential AI collaborations\" with xAI, following its addition of the startup's Grok chatbot to its vehicles last July.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time Musk has combined parts of his sprawling business empire. Last March, he announced that xAI had purchased X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter that Musk bought for $44 billion in 2022.\n\nMerging xAI with one of Tesla or SpaceX would mark a dramatic escalation of the so-called \"Muskonomy,\" however. Here's what it could mean for the future of Elon Musk's business empire.\n\nAt first glance, bringing social media site X, the controversial chatbot Grok, and the reusable rocket Starship under one roof seems like a strange mix. But merging SpaceX and xAI does fit with Musk's long-term vision for an AI-powered future.\n\nThe world's richest man has suggested that the logical conclusion of the AI infrastructure boom is to build data centres in the freezing vacuum of space, where they can access plentiful solar power and operate without the huge amounts of water needed to cool them on Earth.\n\nSpeaking at Davos last week, Musk suggested that space will become the \"lowest cost\" place to train AI, and said that SpaceX will launch solar-powered AI satellites in the next few years that will ultimately scale up to \"hundreds of terawatts\" of energy consumption a year.\n\nMusk has also said that SpaceX's Starship rocket and growing network of Starlink satellites could form the basis of a massive network of orbital AI compute.\n\nAccess to this infrastructure could give xAI an advantage over rivals OpenAI and Google, who are scrambling for computing power and exploring space-based data centers themselves as they look to build ever more powerful AI models.\n\nAnother consideration is funding. Training AI is notoriously expensive, with xAI reportedly burning through billions of dollars in cash and regularly taking on new funding. SpaceX, meanwhile, has seen revenue grow in recent years and is set to tap the public markets for as much as $50 billion.\n\nMerging SpaceX with Tesla, which has been a public company since 2010, would be more complicated — and the payoff less obvious.\n\nThe two companies already enjoy close links, having shared board members and executives in the past. And, in 2018, Musk used SpaceX for some out-of-this-world marketing by blasting his Tesla Roadster into space on a Falcon Heavy rocket.\n\nTheir current businesses, however, have less obvious areas of overlap.\n\nTesla is shifting from a carmaker to an AI and robotics company, with Musk saying on Wednesday that Tesla would scrap the Model X and S and use their production lines to build its Optimus robot.\n\nThe company also has a thriving energy storage business, and at Davos last week, Musk said that both Tesla and SpaceX were separately working to build up to \"a hundred gigawatts a year\" of solar power in the US.\n\nCombining the two could be a step toward Musk's more grandiose dreams of massively expanding humanity's energy production.\n\nMusk also reiterated on Wednesday that he believes Tesla needs to build a \"terafab\" to build advanced AI chips, and in an X post in November suggested that Tesla's terafab could produce chips for SpaceX's solar-powered AI satellites.\n\nOne throughline that connects all of Musk's enterprises is his obsession with settling Mars, which the billionaire has described as critical to humanity's long-term survival.\n\nSpaceX is gearing up to use Starship to launch uncrewed missions to Mars in the coming years, and the billionaire has previously said that these missions would carry Tesla's Optimus to the red planet.\n\nOne thing that's clear is that combining his various companies has been on Musk's mind for a while. Way back in 2020, he responded to a Twitter post suggesting he merge SpaceX, Tesla, and the Boring Company.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI is sending everyone's favourite \"yes man\" version of ChatGPT back into retirement.\n\nIn a blog post on Thursday, the company said it would sunset GPT-4o alongside GPT‑4.1, GPT‑4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-mini on February 13.\n\nOpenAI gave GPT-4o a special mention in its announcement after many users became attached to its \"conversational style and warmth\" last year, which prompted the company to reinstate it following user backlash in August.\n\nNow OpenAI says its latest models, GPT-5.1 and GPT-5.2, have \"improvements to personality,\" including the option to customize the chatbots' tone with styles like \"friendly.\"\n\n\"We're announcing the upcoming retirement of GPT‑4o today because these improvements are now in place, and because the vast majority of usage has shifted to GPT‑5.2, with only 0.1% of users still choosing GPT‑4o each day,\" OpenAI said in its blog post.\n\nEach model has different strengths, and users can select the version best-suited to their needs from a dropdown menu in ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI first released GPT-4o in May 2024. The company rolled back an update in April 2025 that it said was \"overly flattering\" and \"often described as sycophantic.\"\n\nSome users had become attached to GPT-4o's style, though. Within 24 hours of OpenAI retiring the model with the launch of GPT-5 in August, the company reversed its decision for some paying users due to a wave of requests.\n\nSam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said that same month that there was a \"heartbreaking\" reason people had asked for GPT-4o back — because some said they had never had anyone support them before.\n\nThe model was known for responding to mundane prompts with gushing praise, using phrases like \"absolutely brilliant\" and \"you are doing heroic work.\"\n\nOpenAI said in its Thursday blog that it was making \"improvements in personality and creativity, as well as addressing unnecessary refusals and overly cautious or preachy responses,\" and that it was continuing to make progress toward a version of ChatGPT for adults over 18.\n\n\"We know that losing access to GPT‑4o will feel frustrating for some users, and we didn't make this decision lightly,\" OpenAI said in the blog post. \"Retiring models is never easy, but it allows us to focus on improving the models most people use today.\"",

    "description": "Traveling throughout six European countries with my 8-year-old was fun. But I wish I had factored in more kid time for her.",
    "fullText": "This year, my husband and I took our 8-year-old daughter to Europe for a 7-week vacation — overlapping with her school break and a few weeks of term. We started in the Greek islands in early September and made our way slowly by train from Italy to Germany by the end of October.\n\nWe tried to plan the trip around experiences and activities that our daughter would both enjoy and learn from.\n\nAnd while there was a lot we loved about the trip — staying on Greek islands and swimming in the Mediterranean, visiting Pisa and Venice for the first time, and discovering the history and food of Prague — there are three things I would do differently if we did another long holiday abroad with my kid.\n\nAs an only child, our daughter is very used to her own company and is a voracious reader, which is handy at the airport, on a train, or when she has downtime without a screen.\n\nShe still likes to play with other kids, and to give her time to do so, we planned a weekend with friends from the UK. We booked a large house in a town just outside Como, Italy, where we could all spend the weekend together. However, their flight got canceled, and they couldn't make it. We were left in a large house with an upset daughter who had been looking forward to playing with someone other than us.\n\nThere weren't many children her age at the playgrounds and the beach because it was during school term. It was also difficult to find resorts in Greece and Italy with a kids' club. Family campgrounds were too far outside major cities.\n\nWe made up for it by playing lots of card games together, doing family movie nights, going to as many playgrounds as we could find, swimming, and visiting kid-friendly attractions like the butterfly house in Vienna and the Berlin Zoo.\n\nIf we take another long vacation, I will plan the itinerary to include visits with friends or family with children and more family-friendly accommodations.\n\nFor me, eating new foods is one of the main reasons to travel, and while my daughter will try new things, she can sometimes find it a bit overwhelming, preferring to stick to her favorites like chips and pizza.\n\nIn Greece, she was happy to eat kebab meat, cucumber, olives, bread, and chips. Italy was easy with pasta and pizza, but some of the cuisine in Switzerland, Austria, Czechia, and Germany didn't appeal.\n\nBreakfast was another issue. She would not eat pastries, which we had been banking on as our cheap and delicious start to the morning. We carted around a box of cereal to most places. We also resorted to cheese and salami sandwiches with fruit for lunch.\n\nVisiting the local stores and markets was a highlight of our trip — picking out various bread, meats, snacks, and fruits to enjoy. This did help give our daughter some control over what she wanted to eat.\n\nNext time, I will try to stress less about my daughter trying new things and eating enough vegetables and protein. I will also do a better job of utilizing places with kitchen facilities so we don't have to eat out as often.\n\nOur daughter was very patient as we dragged her around various museums and art galleries in Greece, Italy, Switzerland, Vienna, and Prague.\n\nShe loved exploring the archaeological finds at the Acropolis in Athens and the Colosseum in Rome.\n\nThe museums that held her attention were more modern and featured exhibitions tailored for kids, including the Mythos Mozart in Vienna, which was more like an art installation.\n\nIt was at the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague, on the fifth week of our holiday, when we all hit our limit on old churches and museums. There are only so many stained-glass windows, religious-style paintings, and marble busts that one can see on one trip.\n\nOn our next trip, we'll pare back visits to traditional museums and galleries. Instead, we will fill our time with more family-friendly tours, experiences, and free activities.\n\nWhile our trip was one to remember, and I'm so grateful for the experiences we gave our daughter, tweaking a few things will make future trips even better.",

    "description": "Margot Robbie stars in Emerald Fennell's \"Wuthering Heights.\" So far, she's been method-dressing while promoting the film.",
    "fullText": "No one method dresses like Margot Robbie.\n\nThe 35-year-old actor has mastered the art of embracing the characters she plays at red-carpet events. Remember her \"Barbie\" press tour in 2023?\n\nShe's at it again this year while promoting her role in Emerald Fennell's \"Wuthering Heights,\" which will be in theaters on February 13. Robbie has attended interviews, photo calls, and the film's premiere in stunning Victorian-inspired looks.\n\nHere are the outfits she's worn so far, ranked from worst to best.\n\nThe actor was photographed wearing a sleeveless dress by Mark Gong. It had a white printed bodice, a red satin bralette, and a black mesh overlay.\n\nThe outfit was a little too understated and casual by design, especially when paired with the designer's leather wrap heels.\n\nRobbie attended the radio interview alongside her costar, Jacob Elordi, and musician Charli XCX, who worked on the film's music.\n\nStyled by Andrew Mukamal, Robbie wore Alexander McQueen for the late-night show.\n\nHer black-lace dress had long sleeves, a high neckline, and a keyhole cutout down its bodice.\n\nTo complement the see-through piece, Robbie wore black aviator sunglasses, beaded heels, and a long, wavy hairstyle.\n\nShe also donned one-of-a-kind earrings from Jessica McCormack. The sparkling jewelry featured large, pear-shaped diamonds that weighed 15 carats combined.\n\nStill, the outfit wasn't as flashy as the ones she wore later on the tour.\n\nFor a photo shoot at Greystone Mansion, Robbie wore a red leather set by Turkish designer Dilara Findikoglu.\n\nThe snakeskin set featured a corset that highlighted a shell-covered bra, a long-sleeved bolero jacket with laced sleeves, and a micro miniskirt with flared detailing.\n\nOn Instagram, her stylist said the look was inspired by a line from the \"Wuthering Heights\" novel: \"I'd rather be hugged by a snake.\"\n\nThey accessorized the standout look with a Jessica McCormack necklace. It featured a 10-carat, pear-shaped diamond on a red cord.\n\nShe arrived in a Schiaparelli couture gown that might go down as one of the best she's ever worn.\n\nThe strapless design featured a structured, lace bodice with a sweetheart neckline, a black velvet peplum skirt, and a striking red hem that surrounded her like flower petals.\n\nRobbie paired the gown with a heart-shaped necklace that once belonged to Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nThe gold Cartier piece houses the late star's iconic Taj Mahal diamond, which was gifted to Taylor by her former husband Richard Burton on her 40th birthday.\n\nVogue reported that the necklace, which also features a jade mount and ruby stones, is inscribed with the phrase \"Love is Everlasting\" and the name Nur Jahan, who was the jewel's first owner.",

    "fullText": "Michela Allocca built a seven-figure net worth by 30, thanks to increasing her income, diligent saving, and prudent investing.\n\nAfter years in the corporate world, she's now a full-time content creator in the personal finance space.\n\nShe says the first step to hitting financial freedom is simply knowing where your money is.\n\nA 30-year-old who built a seven-figure net worth says the first step toward financial freedom isn't budgeting, investing, or cutting expenses. It's simply knowing where your money is.\n\nBefore focusing on growing wealth, Michela Allocca, founder of the personal finance brand Break Your Budget and author of \"Own Your Money,\" says people need a clear picture of what they already have.\n\nHow much money is in your retirement account? Do you have multiple retirement accounts? Do you have a brokerage account? If so, how much money is in there, and are you actively contributing to it? What about cash — do you have enough in cash, or do you have too much because you're afraid to invest?\n\nIf you can't answer these questions, set aside a weekend morning or weekday evening to sit down and do an \"account audit,\" said Allocca, who spent years in the corporate world before transitioning to full-time content creator. Since quitting, she's quadrupled her income.\n\nOnce you know where you're starting from, you can figure out how much you actually need to reach your goal, whether it's early retirement or becoming work optional.\n\n\"Looking at where your money is really is that first step,\" Allocca said. From there, she recommends using a financial independence calculator to map out realistic targets.\n\nSay you're trying to hit Coast FIRE, an offshoot of the Financial Independence, Retire Early movement, where you no longer need to contribute to your retirement accounts. Instead, the amount you've already invested is expected to grow and compound enough over time to support your retirement, allowing you to \"coast\" into your golden years.\n\n\"You can just go onto Google and very simply search up a financial independence calculator, plug in your numbers, and it will tell you, OK, you need to have, let's say, $250,000 invested in your retirement account by this age in order to reach Coast FIRE,\" she said.\n\nMaybe you're closer to that $250,000 number than you thought, or maybe you've already surpassed it. Whatever the case, now you have a specific goal and know exactly how far away or close you are to reaching it, thanks to your financial audit.",

    "title": "Chinese fishing boats have been making some unusual moves lately in the East China Sea, satellite images and shipping data show",
    "description": "Shipping data showed the vessels gathering in distinct, coordinated lines in the East China Sea twice in recent weeks.",
    "fullText": "Thousands of Chinese fishing vessels amassed in what appeared to be coordinated formations in the East China Sea in recent weeks. Experts say the unusual display suggests more than regular commercial activity.\n\nShipping data tracked these formations, which China watchers and experts familiar with such activities in the region said were unprecedented in scale and highly inconsistent with normal fishing practices.\n\nExperts said this behavior appears linked to China's Maritime Militia, a shadowy, state-directed fleet that Beijing often uses to assert control over contested waterways without triggering a direct military confrontation. It's a prominent yet deniable force. China has rejected such assessments of the activity.\n\nThe first of these irregular movements of Chinese fishing boats occurred on December 25, with more than 2,000 ships forming two reverse L shapes with lines over 290 miles long off the coast of Shanghai. Then, on January 11, almost 1,500 vessels were spotted forming a single line in the same waters stretching roughly 300 miles. The New York Times first reported these activities.\n\nThe number of vessels in the area alone was enough to surprise some experts. \"In observing this type of data for years, I've never seen anything like this,\" Harrison Prétat, deputy director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Business Insider. \"Maybe my initial impression was, okay, is this some type of error, some type of mistake because the number of ships involved is more than anything I've seen before.\"\n\nData from Starboard Maritime Intelligence showed that in both instances, the fishing boats initially dispersed across the East China Sea converged over several days into a defined area, where they formed coordinated alignments. Satellite imagery from Planet Labs on January 10 captured large numbers of vessels moving toward the zone.\n\nOnce in position, they went idle. The vessels remained in those lines for hours before dispersing.\n\n\"The scale, geometry, coordination, and rapid assembly and dispersal of these formations are simply irreconcilable with normal fishing behavior,\" Andrew S. Erickson, a professor at the US Naval War College and expert on the Chinese Maritime Militia, told Business Insider.\n\nSpeaking in a personal capacity and not for the college or Navy, he called it a \"huge, precisely geo-coordinated flash mob.\"\n\nExperts in this space said the pattern of behavior aligns with what is known about how China's Maritime Militia operates.\n\n\"Beijing subsidizes various local and provincial commercial organizations to operate China Maritime Militia vessels to perform 'official' missions on an ad hoc basis outside of their regular civilian commercial activities,\" the Pentagon said in its most recent assessment of China's military.\n\n\"China Maritime Militia units,\" the DoD said, \"employ marine industry workers, usually fishermen, to supplement the PLAN [People's Liberation Army's Navy] and the China Coast Guard. While retaining their day jobs, these mariners are organized and trained, often by the PLAN and the China Coast Guard, and can be activated on demand.\"\n\nThe militia offers China an option for enforcing territorial claims in disputed waters in the South China Sea in ways that aren't as consequential as it might be were China's navy or coast guard to get involved. The militia isn't new, but it is believed to have grown in size and reach over the past decade, engaging in increasingly visible gray zone actions.\n\n\"In contrast to recent years, a majority of ships spent most of their days anchored at China's military outposts rather than at unoccupied reefs where they might pretend to fish. This suggests Chinese authorities are not pressuring vessel owners to maintain the crumbling façade of the militia as a legitimate fishing fleet,\" the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative said in February 2025.\n\nPrétat said the events in December and January might be \"some kind of early test of the ability to organize fishing ships geographically.\" The purpose, though, remains unclear.\n\nErickson told Business Insider it could plausibly be signaling, practice for mobilizing forces, or training.\n\n\"It underscores the reality that this third PRC [People's Republic of China] sea force engages in threatening gray zone operations and war-preparation activities not only in the South China Sea, but also in the East China Sea, with implications for Taiwan, Japan, regional security, and vital US interests,\" he said.\n\nThe Pentagon assesses that in a wartime scenario, such as a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the Maritime Militia could support combat operations in part by creating obstacles to foreign military intervention.\n\nBut Prétat told Business Insider a major concern could also be a militia blockade that assists in \"dissuading, rerouting, and ultimately stopping commercial traffic, cargo, fuel shipments to Taiwan.\"\n\nThe Chinese embassy in the US told Business Insider the East China Sea is an important area for fishing and said that the period from November to February is peak for winter fishing.\n\n\"It is therefore normal to see a high concentration of fishing boats operating at sea during this time,\" embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said. \"Referring to the Chinese fishermen as 'maritime militia' shows malicious intent driven by ulterior motives.\"",

    "fullText": "Minnesota state police arrested a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol employee in St. Paul upon finding the man slumped over his steering wheel while “covered in vomit.”\n\nAt 3:25 a.m. on Tuesday, a Minnesota state trooper found 31-year-old Alfredo Mancillas Jr. of Corpus Christi, Texas, passed out at the wheel in the Hamline-Midway neighborhood, according to charges filed by the St. Paul City Attorney’s Office.\n\nThe story was first reported by Sahan Journal, a nonprofit news organization in Minnesota.\n\nPolice say Mancillas failed a field sobriety test and refused to take a breathalyzer test, after which he was arrested and booked at the Ramsey County jail. He has been charged with 3rd degree and 4th degree driving while impaired.\n\nSahan Journal asked the Department of Homeland Security what role Mancillas serves in Border Patrol, but the department declined to answer.\n\n“CBP stresses honor and integrity in every aspect of our mission, and the overwhelming majority of CBP employees and officers perform their duties with honor and distinction, working tirelessly every day to keep our country safe,” a DHS spokesperson told the Journal via email.\n\nThe arrest comes amid a surge of federal immigration agents in the Twin Cities area. About 3,000 Border Patrol agents and agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement have been deployed to the region in recent weeks. On Saturday, Border Patrol agents fatally shot Alex Pretti, 37, who had been filming them in public. Video of the killing showed an agent removing a firearm from Pretti’s waistband before agents shot him in the back several times. Pretti had a permit to carry the weapon. The killing came two weeks after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good, 37, as she attempted to drive away from agents.\n\nThe Pretti killing, in particular, has prompted a wave of backlash that resulted in the ouster of Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Greg Bovino. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has also drawn scrutiny, and she reportedly told an associate that “everything” she has done has been at the direction of President Donald Trump and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller.\n\nThe post Border Patrol Employee Arrested in Minnesota After Being Found Passed Out in Car and ‘Covered in Vomit’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Don Lemon has said he was reporting on the protest as a journalist. His lawyer called the arrest an \"attack on the First Amendment.\"",
    "fullText": "Don Lemon, the former CNN anchor, was arrested in Los Angeles on Thursday night.\n\nLemon's arrest comes after protesters interrupted a service at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota.\n\nHe has said that he was reporting as a journalist when he entered the Cities Church on January 18. Protesters said that one of the church's pastors also worked for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nIn a statement, Lemon's attorney Abbe Lowell said he was taken into custody by federal agents in Los Angeles, where he was covering the Grammy awards.\n\n\"Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done,\" Lowell said.\n\nLowell called the criminal charges an \"unprecedented attack on the First Amendment.\"\n\n\"Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court,\" he said.\n\nAttorney General Pamela Bondi confirmed Lemon's arrest in a post on X.\n\nShe also said that Georgia Fort, another independent journalist, had been taken into custody, along with two other people.\n\n\"At my direction, early this morning federal agents arrested Don Lemon, Trahern Jeen Crews, Georgia Fort, and Jamael Lydell Lundy, in connection with the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota,\" Bondi wrote.\n\nFort posted a livestream on Facebook on Friday morning where she said federal agents were at her door.\n\n\"They said they were able to go to a grand jury sometime, I guess, in the last 24 hours, and they have a warrant for my arrest,\" Fort said in the video. \"I've talked to my attorney and I've been advised to go with them.\"\n\n\"It's hard to understand how we gave constitutional rights when you can be arrested for just being a member of the press,\" she said at the end of the video. \"Alright, I gotta go, they're knocking.\"\n\nThe Trump administration sought to charge eight people in relation to the Cities Church incident, citing a law protecting people in a service at a house of worship. Minnesota has been rocked by major protests amid a surge of ICE agents that the Trump administration has sent to the state to ramp up deportations.\n\nA federal magistrate judge had previously rejected charges against five people who appeared at the protest, including Lemon, according to The New York Times.\n\nLemon left CNN in 2023 after 17 years at the network. He has since worked as an independent content creator, distributing his work on social media and hosting live events.\n\nThe day after the Cities Church protest, President Donald Trump shared a screenshot of an X post on his Truth Social calling for Lemon to be imprisoned.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Seth Stern, an executive at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, said the arrests of Lemon and Fort were \"naked attacks on freedom of the press.\"\n\n\"These arrests, under bogus legal theories for obviously constitutionally protected reporting, are clear warning shots aimed at other journalists,\" Seth said. \"The unmistakable message is that journalists must tread cautiously because the government is looking for any way to target them.\"",

    "title": "These are the 21 most dangerous countries for US travelers, according to the State Department",
    "description": "The US State Department warns Americans not to travel to these 21 countries due to risks like terrorism, kidnapping, and limited embassy support.",
    "fullText": "Overseas travel can be an immensely enriching experience, from learning about different cultures to seeing some of the world's greatest sights, but in some countries, it can also come with risks.\n\nThe US State Department ranks 21 countries around the world as a travel advisory level four, \"Do Not Travel\" due to risks like terrorism and kidnapping.\n\n\"All countries will rank destinations slightly differently,\" Alan Fyall, a professor of tourism at the University of Central Florida, told Business Insider.\n\nWhile they frequently overlap, the US and the UK don't have identical lists, for example. Historical and cultural ties, proximity, and level of familiarity may all play a role in shaping these lists, he said.\n\nFor some of these countries, the US has suspended embassy operations. That makes it difficult for it to assist travelers when they're in trouble, and that's part of the reason the warnings can be stringent, said Fyall.\n\n\"Do you really want to go and rescue your citizens from a country that, really, they're not that advised to go to in the first place?\" he said.\n\nThe US and UK governments also issue warnings for specific areas in some countries, such as near the Thailand-Malaysia border, the Western Desert in Egypt, or parts of Israel. In July 2025, the US State Department changed Israel and the West Bank's travel advisory from a \"do-not-travel\" to a \"reconsider travel\" country, but the level four advisory has remained for Gaza as well as the Israeli regions near the Lebanese, Syrian, or Egyptian borders.\n\nWhile some risk-takers travel to these countries for a thrill, others visit family or for business.\n\n\"Some people think the perceived risk is overstated,\" Edward Dramberger, a University of South Carolina tourism and hospitality professor, told Business Insider.\n\nFor those who travel to level-four countries, the US State Department often offers routine advice, including staying aware of your surroundings, keeping your travel documents on hand, drafting a will before travel, creating a plan to leave the country without the aid of the US government, and monitoring local news for emergency situations.\n\nNations and regions can change travel advisory levels on the US' list based on changing circumstances, but these are the 21 countries the State Department considers \"do-not-travel\" zones as of January 2026.\n\nSitting between Iran and Pakistan, mountainous Afghanistan has rugged terrain and an arid climate.\n\n\"People perceive Afghanistan as just a desolate, mountain desert country with no attributes, no culture, which is wrong,\" Dramberger said.\n\nDecades of coups, civil wars, and invasions have made the country difficult for travelers to get to know, except via the news.\n\nThe US State Department lists crime, civil unrest, terrorism, wrongful detention, health, and kidnapping among the safety concerns when traveling to Afghanistan. Medical care may be more difficult to obtain in rural areas.\n\nIn 2021, the US Embassy in Kabul closed its operations in the country.\n\nThe agency recommends that American visitors keep a low profile while in the country.\n\nOnce part of the Soviet Union, Belarus maintains close ties with its neighbor, Russia. From Gothic architecture to rare near-endangered species, Belarus has attractions for castle seekers and nature enthusiasts.\n\nIn recent years, Belarus has allowed Russia to use some of its territory to invade Ukraine.\n\nThe risk of civil unrest makes visits to Belarus unwise, according to the State Department. The US Embassy suspended operations there in 2022.\n\nAmericans traveling to Belarus should exercise the usual precautions for visiting high-risk countries and consider leaving their phones, computers, and other electronic devices behind. The State Department also recommends not accessing social media accounts while in Belarus because they may be monitored.\n\nOuagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, is a West African hub of culture and arts, and the country also has an incredible wildlife refuge, Réserve de Nazinga, near its border with Ghana.\n\nDespite the country's positive attributes, the US State Department advises that travelers avoid visiting the country.\n\nThe country's government has declared a state of emergency for several regions.\n\nTerrorism, crime, and other threats have displaced over 2 million residents, as reported by the United Nations. While the displacement crisis has been slowly decreasing, the country still finds itself engulfed in a deep humanitarian crisis.\n\nSince 2015, several citizens of countries like the US have been kidnapped in Burkina Faso, according to the US Overseas Security Advisory Council, which classifies the situation in the country as \"critical.\"\n\nWhile the US Embassy still operates in Ouagadougou, government employees are unable to travel to many parts of the country due to safety concerns, which include the threat of terrorist violence.\n\nIn January 2026, the US government began suspending visas and limiting entry for citizens of 39 countries, including Burkina Faso. As a response measure, the West African country also suspended visas for US citizens.\n\nThe US government's recommendations for lowering risk while traveling in Burkina Faso include avoiding areas where Westerners typically travel and not resisting if someone attempts to rob you.\n\nThe Central African Republic touches several other level-four countries, including Sudan and South Sudan, and is home to incredibly rich biodiversity in its national parks, including Dzanga-Sangha National Park and Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park.\n\nMany of the country's species are endangered, and its citizens have faced decades of instability, according to the United Nations.\n\nRecently, armed groups have targeted Muslims and refugees.\n\nThe US State Department considers CAR a dangerous travel destination due to threats of terrorism, crime, civil unrest, unexploded land mines, and kidnapping, as well as health concerns. US citizens can expect limited help from the US Embassy in Bangui, CAR's capital.\n\nDue to the threat of kidnapping, the US' travel advisory website suggests travelers leave DNA samples with their doctor and establish proof-of-life protocols with family or friends so they can assist you if you're abducted. The State Department also suggests keeping a low profile, avoiding travel to rebel-controlled areas, and not resisting robbery attempts.\n\nThe Caribbean country of Haiti shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican Republic. The country, which won its independence from France in 1804, maintains some of its historic monuments, like its Citadelle Laferrière.\n\nIn recent years, the country has fallen under a state of emergency. In July 2023, the US ordered government employees to leave the country, and since 2025, the US government has enforced a ban on flights to Port-au-Prince, its capital, due to gang violence. The ban has since been extended to March 2026, and the country's capital remains cut off from US travel.\n\nIn addition to the flight ban, the country is also under a travel ban to the US, meaning that its citizens cannot enter the country, and that new visas are not being issued.\n\nIn the capital city of Port-au-Prince, local authorities have enforced curfews and \"shelter-in-place\" advisories since the beginning of the state of emergency.\n\nThe State Department has warned that armed robberies, sexual assaults, and kidnappings are among the reasons to reconsider travel to Haiti.\n\nAnyone who does go should avoid walking in the streets when possible, travel in groups, and keep vehicle doors and windows locked when driving, according to the State Department.\n\nOne way to see over 800 miles of this Middle Eastern country is the Trans-Iranian Railway, which runs from the Caspian Sea to the Persian Gulf. Tehran, the capital, lies along the route.\n\nSome of the country's natural wonders include dormant volcanoes and the stunning limestone formations of Badab-e Surt.\n\nRight now, it's not safe for US citizens to travel to the country, according to the State Department.\n\nFollowing protests in 2022, thousands of people were arrested and tortured by Iranian authorities, according to Amnesty International.\n\nSince December 2025, massive anti-government protests have broken out in the country yet again and have recently resulted in violent crackdowns by state actors, with thousands of deaths and arrests in the tens of thousands. The Iranian government has also imposed an internet blackout in efforts to censor information about the protests.\n\nThe US government has cautioned that Iranian officials may wrongfully and arbitrarily detain or imprison US nationals and other foreigners.\n\nThe travel advisory also warns of terrorism, civil unrest, and kidnapping throughout the country.\n\nThe US doesn't have a physical embassy in Iran. The American government's travel advisory site states that visitors should have a means of leaving Iran that doesn't depend on its assistance, as it cannot provide consular support or facilitate departure from the country.\n\nFrom the Tigris and Euphrates to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, Iraq holds sites that many remember from their ancient history textbooks. Sadly, some of its artifacts were lost to looting during the 2003 Iraq invasion.\n\nSince the US invasion and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Iraq has faced threats from terrorist groups such as ISIS.\n\nTerrorism, kidnapping, and civil unrest are enough of a risk that the State Department considers Iraq a level-four country.\n\nAs of August 2025, ISIS was still active in parts of Iraq, according to OSAC. Armed conflict and terrorist threats are dangerous at the northern borders, per the State Department.\n\nThe State Department also warns that US travelers should avoid the country's northern border and consider making arrangements with a professional security organization for any visits. US employees in the country are also forbidden from using Baghdad International Airport for travel due to security concerns.\n\nAt just over 4,000 square miles, Lebanon is just a bit bigger than Puerto Rico.\n\nA lengthy civil war from 1975 to 1990 left scars in its capital city of Beirut and beyond. In recent years, an economic crisis has taken a toll. Meanwhile, conflicts in neighboring Israel and Syria have also affected Lebanon.\n\nThe US government has said that terrorist groups operating in Lebanon put travelers at risk. There have been suicide bombings, and a gunman opened fire at the embassy in Beirut in June 2024.\n\nThe country's level four travel advisory warns of crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, armed conflict, and unexploded land mines.\n\nThe State Department also warns that US citizens should especially avoid Southern Lebanon, the country's border with Syria, and refugee settlements, urging them to depart if they are there.\n\nVisitors should take the advised security measures for high-risk countries and have a kidnapping protocol in place with family members, per the State Department.\n\nSituated between Egypt and Algeria, Libya has a coastline along the gorgeous Mediterranean Sea. Roman emperor Septimius Severus was born in Leptis Magna, an UNESCO World Heritage site with striking ruins of large, impressive buildings.\n\nViolence, including two recent civil wars, has marred the country. Armed groups have attacked hotels and airports in Tripoli, Sruman, and other cities, according to the State Department. The US Embassy hasn't been active in Tripoli since 2014.\n\nThe State Department warns of violent crime, terrorism, unexploded land mines, civil unrest, widespread kidnapping, and armed conflict throughout the country, and suggests that US citizens draft a will and consult with a professional security organization if traveling to the country.\n\nThe agency urges US citizens in the country to depart as soon as possible via commercial means, even though US commercial flights aren't allowed to operate within the country's airspace.\n\nCenturies-old mosques can be found in Mali's Timbuktu, symbols of its history as a seat of Islamic culture and learning. Its marketplace drew travelers and traders during the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nTo the southwest of Timbuktu is Bamako, Mali's capital. Outside the city and in other parts of the country, terrorists and kidnappers target foreign visitors in the hopes of getting a ransom, according to OSAC. US personnel aren't allowed to visit nightclubs or attend concerts for safety reasons.\n\nThe State Department's advisory warns of terrorism, civil unrest, inadequate health services, and violent crime, including kidnapping, throughout the country.\n\nSome advice for traveling in Mali includes avoiding walking deserted streets at night, carrying minimal cash, not leaving valuables in your hotel, and looking for a well-lit area when stopped by police.\n\nUS citizens are also advised to avoid travel outside Bamako and to have a plan to leave an emergency plan that doesn't require help from the US government.\n\nLocated on the Bay of Bengal in Southeast Asia, Myanmar boasts a fascinating mix of architecture, from pagodas and palaces to colonial hotels and government offices. One stupa, or pagoda, the Shwedagon, is the country's most sacred Buddhist site.\n\nA coup in 2021 sparked demonstrations. The military detained protestors and used force against them and bystanders, according to the State Department.\n\nThe risk of continued civil unrest and wrongful detentions, and arbitrary arrests, as well as poor health infrastructure, land mines, and crime, makes it unwise to travel to the country, according to the US State Department travel advisory.\n\nSome armed groups have used improvised explosive devices in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city, while NGOs have reported land mines in Shan State, Chin State, and Kachin State.\n\nVisitors to the landlocked African country of Niger can explore the ancient mud-brick mosque of Grande Mosquée d'Agadez and the storied old town of Agadez, as well as see the Sahara Desert and the country's unique wildlife.\n\nIn October 2025, the US authorized that all government employees leave the country due to widespread safety concerns. Parts of the country have been under a state of emergency for over a decade, and local authorities \"require military escorts for any foreigners\" traveling outside the capital, Niamey, per the US State Department.\n\nThe agency warns of violent crime, civil unrest, terrorism, limited health services, and kidnapping throughout the country.\n\nIf they choose to visit anyway, US citizens are advised by the government to draft a will and have an emergency plan that doesn't depend on support from the US Embassy.\n\nOne of the world's most mysterious and isolated countries, North Korea shares borders with South Korea, China, and Russia. Kim Jong-Un took over the presidency in 2011, continuing a family dynasty that's been in power since the 1950s.\n\nIn 2025, North Korea reopened to Western tourists for the first time since the pandemic. The State Department warns that US nationals may be arrested and held for extended periods.\n\nIt warns that it cannot provide emergency services to its citizens who are detained, as the two countries do not have diplomatic relations.\n\nRussia's cities contain dazzling buildings, and its landscape is breathtaking. Siberia's Lake Baikal is the planet's oldest and deepest. The world's last woolly mammoths lived and died out on Wrangel Island, where polar bears, musk oxen, and walruses now congregate.\n\nDue to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US State Department has declared it unsafe for US citizens, who may face harassment or detention. The US State Department urges every US citizen in the country to leave immediately, and notes that authorities might not inform the US government if an American is arrested.\n\nThe US' travel advisory also cited drone attacks and explosions in Moscow, St. Petersburg, locations near the Ukrainian border, and other areas.\n\nThe State Department notes there may be risks for those with dual US-Russian nationality. Because the situation is volatile, travelers should stay informed about the latest local news while visiting.\n\nDigital communications also pose a risk, and the agency advises US citizens to reconsider bringing any electronic devices into the country, as the Russian government's security services closely monitor electronic communications and can use them to arrest foreign nationals.\n\nThose who still choose to travel to the country are advised by the government to prepare for wrongful detention, draft a will, and leave DNA samples with a medical provider.\n\nLocated in the Horn of Africa, Somalia's lengthy coastline borders the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. Somali archaeologist Sada Mire has called the capital, Mogadishu, an \"unbreakable pearl,\" tracing its history as a trade center back to the first century AD.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Somalia experienced famine and civil war. Instability continued in the form of terror attacks, including a suicide bombing on a popular beach in 2024.\n\nDue to the possibility of kidnapping, terrorism, and civil unrest, the US has issued a do-not-travel advisory. The State Department notes that the US also has very limited consular services in the country and that health services in Somalia can be limited and absent in rural areas.\n\nThe State Department also advised against sailing near Somalia's coast due to piracy.\n\nIt was only during the 21st century that South Sudan declared its independence and was recognized as a sovereign state. Its neighbors include Sudan, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nIts short history was dominated by a civil war, and a new conflict is brewing between the military and an opposition force, which clashed near the Ethiopian border. NGOs, the UN, and others have found it difficult to accurately assess crime levels, but firearms easily cross the border from Sudan, according to OSAC.\n\nThe US State Department warns of civil unrest, violent crimes, kidnapping, unexploded land mines, and limited health services in the country and urges US citizens not to travel to the country for any reason.\n\nAnyone traveling in South Sudan should avoid its border areas and adhere to restrictions around public photography and videography, the State Department says.\n\nKhartoum, Sudan, is where the Blue and White Niles meet. Meroë is further north, where ancient Kushite rulers lived and were buried in pyramids. Some date back to the third century BCE; several have collapsed but others retain decorative carvings.\n\nCivil war threatens not only the archaeological history but locals and travelers. Officials at the US Embassy hastily evacuated Khartoum in 2023, soon after the conflict broke out. Various groups frequently engage in violent fighting, the State Department says.\n\nThe Darfur, Khartoum, and Kordofan regions have all been sites for kidnappings, according to OSAC. The Khartoum International Airport is closed.\n\nThe State Department warns of widespread violent crime, kidnapping, terrorism, unrest, unexploded land mines, and extremely limited health services in the country.\n\nThe US travel advisory suggests travelers be aware of their surroundings, especially in locations where Westerners typically visit, and that they draft a proof-of-life protocol with loved ones in case of kidnapping.\n\nNot only is Damascus the capital of Syria, but it's also the seat of cultural history. Established over 2,000 years ago, it's one of the oldest cities in the Middle East. Evidence of its Roman and Byzantine past exists alongside important Islamic monuments such as the Umayyad Mosque.\n\nDespite the allure of these ancient sites, the US doesn't recommend travel to Syria. A lengthy civil war broke out in 2011, with efforts to oust Bashar Assad from power. Since Assad resigned at the end of 2024, violence has continued to erupt in parts of western Syria.\n\nThe State Department has also warned that terrorism, kidnapping and hostage-taking, and unjust detention are risks in Syria, saying that \"no part of Syria is safe from violence.\"\n\nThe agency recommends visitors set up proof-of-life protocols with loved ones, among other precautions, before and during travel.\n\nMuch like Istanbul's Hagia Sofia, for which it was named, the Saint Sophia Cathedral serves as an eye-catching landmark in Kyiv. It's just one of the Ukrainian capital's architectural treasures.\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine in 2022, and years of fighting have ensued, mainly in the east, where the border lies. Belarusian troops are also present along its border with Ukraine.\n\nThe ongoing conflict is the principal reason the US government cautions against visiting. Areas that aren't on the frontline of fighting could still experience drone and missile attacks, the State Department notes.\n\nDrafting a will, coordinating a security plan, and creating a communication protocol with loved ones are just a few of the steps suggested on the travel advisory website.\n\nWith its dizzying height of over 3,000 feet, the Salto Ángel waterfall has drawn tourists for decades, though it's notoriously tricky to access. It's found in the southeast of Venezuela, in the Canaima National Park, in the Amazon rainforest near the border with Brazil and Guyana.\n\nThe country is in the midst of an economic and political crisis. Heavily reliant on oil for income, it suffered years of recession. In 2024, the US and several other countries refused to recognize the results of its presidential election, calling it fraudulent, BBC News reported at the time.\n\nSince then, the US has launched a multifaceted military presence that has increased naval posture and tensions in the Caribbean and led to the capture of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro by US military forces in January.\n\nThe US Embassy ceased operations in Caracas in 2019 amid the country's deep economic crisis. The State Department has issued warnings about arbitrary detentions and unpredictable enforcement of local laws. In 2023 and 2025, Venezuela released several Americans, some of whom were \"wrongfully detained,\" according to the US government.\n\nThe US State Department's travel advisory emphasizes the \"extreme danger to US citizens living in or traveling to Venezuela\" and urges all US citizens and lawful permanent residents to leave the country immediately.\n\nThe travel advisory warns of wrongful detention and torture, arbitrary law enforcement, civil unrest, widespread violent crime, including kidnapping, and poor health services throughout the country.\n\nTravelers who still choose to visit the country may want to hire a professional security team during their stay and prepare a will before their trip, according to the US travel advisory site.\n\nBeautiful gypsum patterns adorn red fired-brick buildings in the Old City of Sana'a. People have lived in this area of Yemen for over 2,500 years. The country is located on the Arabian Peninsula next to Saudi Arabia and Oman.\n\nYemen's civil war started over a decade ago and continues today. The threat of armed conflict continues, according to OSAC. Detained US citizens have not been allowed to contact their families or the embassy, which suspended its operations in 2015.\n\nThe US travel advisory says US citizens should avoid travel to the country due to the threat of terrorism, civil unrest, unexploded land mines, crime, including kidnapping, and health risks.\n\nThe State Department warns against visiting the Yemeni island of Socotra. Some travel companies have offered trips there with unofficial visas, which puts travelers at risk, according to the travel advisory website.",

    "description": "Marc Andreessen says AI is arriving just in time to offset shrinking workforces and decades of weak productivity growth.",
    "fullText": "Worried that AI will take your job? Marc Andreessen isn't.\n\nThe venture capitalist and cofounder of Andreessen Horowitz says the loudest fear around artificial intelligence — that it will wipe out jobs — is aimed at the wrong problem.\n\nThe real danger, he said, is what the global economy was heading toward without AI.\n\n\"If we didn't have AI, we'd be in a panic right now about what's going to happen to the economy,\" Andreessen said in an episode of \"Lenny's Podcast\" released on Thursday.\n\nWithout a major technological boost, he added, the world would be staring at \"a future of depopulation,\" where shrinking workforces and slow productivity growth would cause economies to stagnate or even contract.\n\nFor about the past two decades, research shows that productivity growth in advanced economies has been unusually weak by historical standards, slowing further after the global financial crisis of 2008 despite rapid advances in digital technology.\n\nAt the same time, birth rates across the US, Europe, China, and much of the developed world have remained below the replacement level of about 2.1 children per woman — the threshold needed to keep populations stable.\n\n\"Depopulation without new technology would just mean that the economy shrinks,\" Andreessen said.\n\nAndreessen's assessment echoes warnings from some demographers and some tech leaders like Elon Musk, who has repeatedly warned about the economic risks of population decline — a threat that the US and Europe have been trying to avert by promoting pro-natal policies.\n\nAI, in Andreessen's view, arrives at exactly the right moment to fix that declining workforce.\n\nRather than displacing workers en masse, it will help offset the shortage of people available to do the work, he said.\n\n\"The only reason we're not worried about that,\" he said, \"is because we now know that we have the technology that can substitute for the lack of population growth.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean jobs won't change. Andreessen is clear that AI will reshape work at the task level, automating parts of roles across engineering, design, and product management.\n\nBut he rejected the idea of widespread permanent unemployment — a prediction made to varying extents by several senior AI researchers, including Geoffrey Hinton, often called the \"godfather of AI,\" computer science professor Roman Yampolskiy, and UC Berkeley professor Stuart Russell.\n\nEven a dramatic increase in productivity, he said, would only return the economy to levels of job churn seen during earlier industrial booms — periods widely remembered as times of opportunity, not collapse.\n\nIn fact, Andreessen expects human labor to become more valuable in many countries as populations shrink and immigration slows.\n\n\"The remaining human workers are going to be at a premium, not at a discount,\" he said.\n\nIn a more extreme scenario in which AI drives massive productivity gains, Andreessen predicts falling prices across goods and services — effectively raising living standards even if some jobs disappear.\n\n\"That's the equivalent of giving everybody a giant raise,\" he said.\n\nHis conclusion is blunt: AI isn't threatening the economic future. It's preventing a much bleaker one.",

    "fullText": "A law enforcement agency executing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown has been described as a serial violator of court orders in Minnesota.\n\nThe declaration didn't come from the Democratic governor or Minneapolis' Democratic mayor, who have repeatedly traded barbs with President Donald Trump. It was a federal judge with a conservative pedigree who has added a powerful voice to a saga that has stirred the nation.\n\n“ICE is not a law unto itself,” Chief U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz wrote this week, referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nSchiltz wasn't referring to the tactics of immigration officers, who have killed two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis, burst into homes with battering rams, smashed windows and pulled people from cars, and tossed tear gas at irate protesters.\n\nRather, after surveying other judges in his court, Schiltz was talking about the government's failure to comply with nearly 100 court orders since Jan. 1 in 74 cases in which people arrested during Operation Metro Surge have sued seeking release or other relief. Even that number, he said, is \"almost certainly substantially understated.\"\n\n“This list should give pause to anyone — no matter his or her political beliefs — who cares about the rule of law. ... ICE has every right to challenge the orders of this Court, but, like any litigant, ICE must follow those orders unless and until they are overturned or vacated,” Schiltz wrote.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Homeland Security Department, called Schiltz's declaration a “diatribe from this activist judge.\"\n\n“We will not be deterred by activists either in the streets or on the bench,” she said in a statement.\n\nDeputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller also slammed the judge’s comments on social media: “The judicial sabotage of democracy is unending.”\n\nSchiltz is among several judges who have called out the federal government and tried to keep officials accountable during a remarkable surge of immigration enforcement. U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez prohibited officers from using tear gas or pepper spray against peaceful protesters in Minnesota, though an appeal has put it on hold.\n\nIn November, a Chicago federal judge put similar limits on the use of force and said a Border Patrol commander lied about threats faced by officers. An appeals court halted the remedy, and the lawsuit was recently dropped as tensions eased.\n\nSchiltz, 65, has been a judge for about 20 years after being nominated by Republican President George W. Bush. He served as a law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a noted conservative jurist, and was a practicing attorney and law professor.\n\n“This is not a judge who courts controversy,” said Mark Osler, a former federal prosecutor who teaches law at the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis.\n\n“He has a deep belief in the rule of law,\" Osler said. “Our social contract includes that when government officials are ordered by the courts to do something, there should be a good faith effort to make that happen. When we lose that we lose the accountability for government that an ordered society requires.\"\n\nOn Monday, Schiltz said he was taking the “extraordinary” step of ordering ICE's acting director, Todd Lyons, to appear and explain why he should not be held in contempt for the agency's failure to comply with orders. The Department of Homeland Security responded by calling him an “activist judge.” Schiltz canceled the hearing after an immigrant in that case was released.\n\nSchiltz acknowledged to Fox News Digital that he has donated to Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, which gives free counsel to immigrants, and Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid. He said he believes poor people should get access to legal help.",

    "description": "Reactions are already pouring in from prominent economists and business leaders about President Donald Trump nominating Kevin Warsh.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has chosen Kevin Warsh, a former bank executive and central bank governor, to lead the Federal Reserve.\n\nWithin minutes of the nomination, reactions started pouring in from prominent economists and business leaders.\n\nHere are what some of the leading voices in economics and business are saying.\n\nThe renowned economist Mohamed El-Erian congratulated Warsh on his nomination to lead the Fed.\n\n\"Having observed and interacted with Kevin during his prior tenure as Fed Governor, in academia, and as a fellow member of the Group of Thirty (G-30), I believe he brings a strong mix of deep expertise, broad experience, and sharp communication skills,\" El-Erian wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"His commitment to reforming and modernizing the Fed bodes well for enhancing policy effectiveness and protecting the institution's political independence.\"\n\nEarlier in January, El-Erian wrote on X that the Department of Justice probe into Jerome Powell could undermine the \"credibility of a Fed whose public standing is already fragile.\"\n\nJason Furman, a Harvard economist and former top economist to President Barack Obama, wrote on X that \"Warsh is well above the bar on both substance and independence to be Chair of the Federal Reserve.\"\n\n\"The Senate should ask tough questions about his independence & President Trump should reduce the threat to it. Hopefully that will make it clear Warsh should be confirmed,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Warsh has a range of views that would not have led me to recommend a Democratic President nominate him as Federal Reserve Chair,\" Furman added. \"I would be thrilled if he ends up conducting himself over the next four years in a way that would make a President of any party want to reappoint him.\"\n\nJoseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist for RSM US LLP, said Warsh meets the bar to lead the Fed, but he should be questioned on central bank independence and reform, as well as on reducing the Fed's balance sheet.\n\n\"Moreover, he should be challenged to how he would respond in a financial crisis given his public track record of focusing on inflation risk during a time of rising unemployment and deflation during the early portion of the Great Financial crisis,\" Brusuelas wrote on X.\n\n\"Warsh has a range of views and track record that presents significant concerns about how he would proceed during a financial and economic crisis. I would not have recommended him but he is qualified for the job,\" he added.\n\nRobin Brooks, senior fellow at Brookings, said in an X post that Warsh \"is a really good pick for Fed Chair and known as a hawk.\"\n\nHe did, however, note the muted market reaction in the minutes after the announcement.\n\n\"But markets are asking themselves what was promised to get the nod, which is why the Dollar - after its huge decline in recent days - isn't managing to rally on what should be good news,\" said Brooks, who was also a managing director and chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.\n\nPaul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and research professor at the City University of New York's Graduate Center, criticized Warsh's nomination.\n\nHe wrote in a post on his Substack: \"As I write this, many media reports are describing Warsh as a monetary hawk. That's a category error. Warsh is a political animal. He calls for tight money and opposes any attempt to boost the economy when Democrats hold the White House.\"\n\nKrugman cited Warsh's track record as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, saying he had \"argued strenuously against the Fed's efforts to boost the economy.\"\n\n\"It's a humiliating day for the Federal Reserve, which has always prided itself on its professionalism and has been hugely respected around the world. But even the Fed can't insulate itself from the derangement sweeping America,\" he added.\n\nSonali Basak, the chief investment strategist for iCapital and a former Bloomberg anchor, wrote on X: \"Between Bessent & Warsh, you have two proteges of Stanley Druckenmiller in the most powerful finance posts in government.\"\n\nWarsh is a partner at billionaire Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office LLC.\n\nGeorge Osborne, the UK's former Chancellor of the Exchequer, praised Trump's decision to nominate Warsh as Fed chair.\n\n\"Kevin Warsh is an excellent choice as Chair of the Fed - smart, serious, experienced, knows the new economy as well as the old,\" said Osborne, who leads OpenAI for Countries, wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"I've been fortunate enough to know him for more than twenty years and this is the job he was put on earth to do. The world feels a little safer - and more prosperous - today,\" he added.\n\nHoward, the billionaire founder of $33 billion macro hedge fund Brevan Howard, called Warsh an \"outstanding choice for Fed Chair.\"\n\n\"I've known him for more than 20 years, and his judgment, integrity, and depth of experience will make him an exceptional leader of the Federal Reserve,\" Howard said in a statement sent to Business Insider.",

    "title": "I've lived in a camper van with my dog for 3 years. Traveling full-time with a pet has been surprisingly wonderful.",
    "description": "We live in a van with an Australian cattle dog. There are challenges to caring for a pet on the road, but also a lot of surprising benefits and perks.",
    "fullText": "\"It's cruel to keep a dog in a small space like that,\" read one Instagram comment.\n\nI had just posted a vlog of our morning routine after waking up in a Walmart parking lot. The video showed me and Scout slipping out of our yellow camper van so she could use the bathroom and play a round of tug as the sun rose above the pavement.\n\nIt was the start of a wonderful day with the road beneath our wheels and the world at our fingertips, but I wasn't surprised by the social media stranger's skepticism.\n\nDespite the rising popularity of #vanlife, living in a vehicle is still unusual — and, of course, people have concerns when you add pets to the picture.\n\nI had concerns myself. When my partner and I hit the road in early 2023, we were prepared for nomadic life to pose quite the challenge for our shy Australian cattle dog.\n\nIn many ways, though, moving into a van has made it easier to keep her happy.\n\nScout is ludicrously sweet … and also incredibly sensitive. When I adopted her, she would shut down in new places. The first time we took her on a trip, she couldn't be left in an unfamiliar Airbnb without panicking.\n\nYou might think living in a van would be a horrible fit, but it's actually perfect. Our van is our home. Even when we park somewhere we've never been, we bring the comfort of Scout's own space along.\n\nAt the same time, she gets to explore new places. Our living space may be small, but we don't \"keep\" Scout anywhere; we take her everywhere.\n\nWithin a single day, she might sniff at a brand-new park, people-watch from the grocery store parking lot, practice impulse control in a crowded campground, and enjoy an off-leash romp through the wilderness.\n\nIf she ever feels overwhelmed, though, her bed in a familiar, temperature-controlled van is right there, waiting for her.\n\nBack when we lived in a home that didn't have wheels, we'd sometimes arrive at a destination only to realize we'd forgotten something important. Scout's favorite Frisbee never made it to the beach; I parked at a coffee shop patio only to realize I left her leash at home.\n\nNow, if Scout needs a drink, I just grab her bowl off the van's floor. If she wants to play, we have an entire bin of toys, no matter where we're parked. If she gets injured, we can reach our canine first aid kit in seconds.\n\nOn a similar note, it's easier for her to get outside when she needs or wants to. Most of the time, when Scout has to pee, it's as simple as opening the side door. This convenience is a far cry from when we lived on the third floor of an apartment building.\n\nPlanning for her basic needs takes almost no effort — which means I can channel my resources into other things, like fully experiencing the present moment.\n\nOur dog is on twice-daily epilepsy medication. Traveling full-time requires filling her prescription at different locations every couple of months, which is more of a hassle than it might be if we lived in one place with a consistent pharmacy.\n\nAlong with locating the nearest pharmacy, every time we drive more than 50 or 100 miles, I also have to search for the nearest emergency vet in case something goes wrong.\n\nAnother challenge is constantly staying on the lookout for pet health risks. Sometimes we move between climates quickly, thrusting us into an environment with new threats, from disease-carrying ticks to rattlesnakes.\n\nAlso, lazier days are tough to come by. When we lived in a house, we could spend an entire day without leaving our property if one of us was sick or Scout needed extra rest following a big adventure.\n\nNow, because we have a tiny indoor space — and, depending on where we're parked, very little privacy — it's harder to curl up in one spot and relax.\n\nIn seven years, Scout has lived in four apartments across three states, one house with a fully fenced yard, and now a van.\n\nAs far as her body language tells me, though, this is the best home she's ever had.\n\nOur world is bigger than the confines of our vehicle-turned-house — and our dog is happier, braver, and more fulfilled than ever.",

    "fullText": "Today's the day not to do much of anything.\n\nAt least, that's what a group of ICE protesters is hoping for.\n\nActivist groups, unions, and some celebrities, including Hannah Einbinder and Pedro Pascal, are promoting a nationwide blackout. No work. No school. No shopping. It's in response to the recent fatal shootings by immigration officers in Minnesota.\n\nOf course, getting buzz on social media about a protest is one thing. Executing it is something else entirely. Minnesotans did take to the streets for a regional protest on January 23, but this is on a much larger scale.\n\nIt's unclear what, if any, impact Friday's protest will have on the economy. For context, boycotters last year planned an economic blackout of major retailers on February 28 to protest corporate corruption.\n\nThe impact wasn't massive — only a 5.4% drop in sales, according to Numerator — but Black and LGBTQ+ shoppers did noticeably shift their spending habits that day.\n\nBut these one-off events are more so meant to signal frustration than destroy companies' bottom lines. And some change has already been elicited, as Maine Sen. Susan Collins announced ICE halted \"enhanced activities\" in the state.\n\nOne company that's right in the thick of it has issues beyond a one-day blackout.\n\nMinneapolis-based Target has deep ties to the city and a history of navigating civil unrest there. Now it has the added challenge of doing it with a new CEO.\n\nMichael Fiddelke is facing a baptism by fire as he takes over as Target's new CEO this weekend, writes BI's Dominick Reuter and Sarah Needleman.\n\nHundreds of Target employees already signed a letter urging the company to bar ICE from its stores. Fiddelke addressed the situation in a video message Monday, but didn't name Trump or ICE specifically.\n\nFiddelke's problems don't just stem from the rising tension in the city over the past few weeks. In recent years, Tar-jay has started feeling pretty blasé. Over the past 12 quarters, 10 have had flat or declining comparable sales.\n\nBut Target didn't bring in outside talent to shake things up. Fiddelke is a true company man, starting at Target as a finance intern. And former longtime CEO Brian Cornell is sticking around as executive chairman.\n\nFiddelke's deep knowledge of the company could be considered a strength. But with so much ground to make up, drastic changes outside what's been the norm might be the company's best way forward.",

    "description": "As someone who's visited all 63 major US national parks, I think some of the most beautiful include Acadia, Grand Teton, Olympic, and North Cascades.",
    "fullText": "It's been said that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but as someone who's visited all 50 states and every US national park, I'd argue that there are some places where beauty simply can't be denied.\n\nWhether from towering mountains, cerulean-blue lakes, impressive wildlife, or surreal otherworldly landscapes, some parks just stand out more than others.\n\nHere are my picks for the seven most beautiful US national parks.\n\nGrand Teton National Park in Wyoming always tops my list of the most beautiful landscapes in the country.\n\nThe towering, jagged mountains are just one aspect of the incredible beauty in this park, with large lakes visitors can swim, kayak, and boat on.\n\nThere are also challenging hiking trails and some of the most beautiful sunrises and sunsets I've ever encountered.\n\nIn my opinion, there's truly no place like Yosemite National Park, where the famed towering granite cliffs of El Capitan and Half Dome rise thousands of feet from the valley floor.\n\nThe park also features some of the tallest waterfalls in the country. To top things off, the giant Sequoia groves and large stretches of wilderness in the park create a striking contrast unlike anything else I've ever experienced.\n\nAs one of the most-visited US national parks, Acadia is obviously no hidden gem.\n\nBut, in my opinion, the sometimes-crowded Maine park is also one of the most breathtakingly beautiful spots in the US. The clashing of coastal, mountain, and forest landscapes is simply spectacular.\n\nI recommend spending a day watching the waves crash on the rugged Ocean Path Trail, or relaxing at the beach before going on a strenuous hike.\n\nThe Grand Canyon is a bucket list park for a reason. I challenge anyone to visit for the first (or sixth time) and not be in awe when looking at the vastness of the canyon.\n\nThe scale makes it a special place you must truly see to believe. Stretching 277 miles, the canyon brings a perspective I haven't found anywhere else.\n\nAlthough North Cascades National Park is less than three hours from Seattle, this park is still slightly under-the-radar. At over 500,000 acres, the landscape is stunning and rugged, with an untamed beauty that's rare to find in the lower 48 states.\n\nPlus, North Cascades is home to lakes that are so turquoise in color that they look like they're straight out of the Caribbean.\n\nI've driven on Going-to-the-sun Road in Glacier National Park nearly a dozen times now, and each time, I have to pull over at least once because I become overwhelmed with emotion.\n\nThe massive and dramatic glacier-carved landscape has towering mountains on every side. The park is home to clear glacial lakes, gorgeous wildflowers, challenging hikes, and plenty of wildlife.\n\nOne can spend a lifetime exploring Glacier National Park and never lose the awe of that first view.\n\nOlympic National Park is incredibly diverse, with a mix of coastal beaches, rainforests, and imposing mountain ranges.\n\nThere's plenty to do in this park, from summiting a snow-capped mountain to exploring the mystical Hoh Rainforest — which is said to be one of the quietest places in the US.\n\nI recommend taking the time to hike through the old-growth forests before watching an epic sunset on one of the park's rugged coastlines.\n\nThis story was originally published on March 24, 2024, and most recently updated on January 30, 2026.",

    "description": "Gold and silver plunged on Friday as traders reacted to Kevin Warsh's nomination as Fed chair. The dollar jumped and the debasement trade took a hit.",
    "fullText": "The rally pushing gold and silver to new records finally stumbled on Friday as markets reacted to Donald Trump's pick to run the Federal Reserve.\n\nKevin Warsh, a former Fed Governor, will replace Jerome Powell this year if confirmed by the Senate. The news sent metals tumbling on Friday as investors repriced their outlook for monetary policy and the so-called debasement trade that's helped gold'd record-setting rally took a hit.\n\nGold, which is still up more than 70% in the last year, dropped 7% to trade around $5,000 an ounce. It had briefly dipped below $5,000 before paring losses.\n\nSilver, which has roared more than 200% higher in the last year, plunged as much as 15% to trade around $99 an ounce.\n\nMarkets have been worried for months about Trump's Fed pick, as it was believed that Trump would plug in a new Fed chief to aggressively lower interest rates and help his big affordability push.\n\nThat's pushed down the value of the US dollar, one trend that's made precious metals more attractive over the past year.\n\nBut Warsh, who moved to the front of the line in Trump's Fed Chair search in recent weeks, is considered more hawkish and likely to preserve the Fed's independence.\n\nThat last point—that Trump could use his nominee to wrest control of the central bank—has been a big driver of the debasement trade, which has boosted gold and hurt the dollar over the last year.\n\nThe US Dollar Index, which has declined 11% in 12 months, spiked shortly after Trump announced his Fed Chair pick on Truth Social, climbing 0.5% Friday morning.\n\nThe dollar's surge appeared to jump-start the sell-off in metals, Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told Business Insider.\n\n\"You knew there was going to be some trigger that would cause a bit of a technical pullback,\" he said, adding that investors were eager to take profits after the parabolic move in metals over the last 12 months.\n\nJosé Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, described the sell-off in metals as a \"knee-jerk reaction\" to Trump's Fed Chair pick. It's also natural for metals to pull back given the significant move to the upside in recent months, much of which was fueled by hype and speculation, he said.\n\n\"What President Trump wants is a dove. However, Warsh historically is an inflation hawk. I think there's a lot of confusion going on right now in terms of what kind of Warsh we're going to get at the Fed,\" he told Business Insider, pointing to the move in the dollar and precious metals.\n\n\"Okay, maybe the central bank is not going to be as loose as it might have been under perhaps Kevin Hassett,\" he added of the market's thinking.\n\nDavid Rosenberg, an economist and the founder of Rosenberg Research, noted that Warsh's nomination could have caused some investors to reverse course on the debasement trade, in which investors scoop up hard assets like gold and silver out of concern that the US dollar is at risk from macro forces including higher inflation, chaotic trade policy, and a politicized central bank.\n\n\"The market reaction so far points to 'less dovish' and more 'orthodox expectations, with independence fears easing at the margin. There is some unwinding in the so-called debasement trade,\" Rosenberg wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\nHogan said it was too early to tell whether the debasement trade was truly unwinding, though the reaction on Friday suggested some investors were moving in that direction.\n\n\"It's understandable that you're going to get a pretty abrupt reaction when the pressures turn around,\" he said of the move, speculating that metals could drop further.",

    "title": "If You See A Green Dot On Your Phone, Here’s What It Actually Means",
    "description": "The green dot on your phone can mean a few things—find out what.",
    "fullText": "That tiny green dot appearing in the corner of your phone screen isn't a glitch or a random notification—it's actually your phone trying to tell you something important about your privacy. Both iPhone and Android devices now use this indicator to let you know when certain hardware is being accessed. Most of the time, it's completely harmless. But sometimes, it's worth paying attention to.\n\nAccording to Apple Support, a green indicator on your iPhone means either the camera alone or the camera and microphone together are being used by an app. This feature was introduced with iOS 14 as a privacy measure, giving users real-time awareness of when their device's sensors are active. The dot appears in the upper right corner of the screen, near your battery and signal icons.\n\nOn Android devices running version 12 or later, the green dot serves a similar purpose. It lights up whenever an app accesses your camera or microphone. The indicator works automatically in the background without requiring any setup from users—it's built into the operating system as a standard privacy feature.\n\niPhone users actually have two privacy indicators to watch for. The green dot signals camera access, while an orange dot means an app is using only the microphone. If you're on a video call where both are active, you'll see just the green dot since it covers both scenarios.\n\nAndroid phones handle this differently. According to security experts, Android devices use only the green dot indicator for both camera and microphone access, rather than separating them into two colors. When an app first accesses your sensors, you'll briefly see a camera or microphone icon before it changes to the simple green dot.\n\nPrivacy experts recommend getting into the habit of checking your Control Center immediately whenever you see the green or orange dot appearing on your iPhone. Simply swipe down from the top-right corner of your screen, and you'll see the name of the app currently using your camera or microphone displayed at the top. For older iPhones with a home button, swipe up from the bottom instead.\n\nOn Android, the process is similar. Swipe down from the top of your screen when you see the green dot, and you'll see either a camera or a microphone icon. Tap on it to reveal which app is accessing your hardware. This identification system lets you catch potentially unwanted access in real-time.\n\nThe green dot showing up doesn't automatically mean something sinister is happening. It appears during expected activities like taking photos, recording videos, making video calls, or using FaceTime. It also lights up during less obvious but still legitimate uses—like scanning a QR code or interacting with Google Assistant.\n\nMany people see the dot and immediately worry, but the most common explanation is simply that an app you used recently is still running in the background. You might have switched away from your camera app or video chat without fully closing it.\n\nSecurity researchers note that people regularly switch between apps without closing them down when finished, which means the camera or microphone could be accessed by an app you didn't realize was still running. A video conferencing app might still be active after you thought you ended the call, or a social media app might be accessing your camera even when you're not actively taking photos.\n\nIf you see the dot appearing unexpectedly, close all your open apps and see if it disappears. On iPhone, swipe up from the bottom and pause to see your open apps, then swipe them away. On Android, use your recent apps button to close running applications.\n\nWhile most green dot appearances are harmless, there's a more concerning possibility. According to cybersecurity experts, there could be a spyware app running in the background, accessing your microphone and camera to spy on you and steal your data. If the dot appears when you're not actively using any app that should need camera access, it warrants investigation.\n\nSigns of a genuine problem include the dot appearing constantly even when no apps are open, unfamiliar app names showing up when you check the Control Center, or the indicator lighting up repeatedly throughout the day for no apparent reason.\n\nAccording to security guidance, you should be concerned if you see the green privacy indicator show up all the time, even when you aren't particularly using any app—this means some application has continuous access to your microphone, camera, or both, and this is likely to be a malicious app that could be spying on you.\n\nTo review which apps have camera access on iPhone, go to Settings, then Privacy & Security, then Camera. On Android, navigate to Settings, then Privacy, then Permission Manager, then Camera. From these menus, you can revoke access for any app that doesn't need it.\n\nNot every app that asks for camera or microphone permission actually needs it. A weather app has no legitimate reason to access your camera. A calculator shouldn't need your microphone. If you notice apps with unnecessary permissions, it's worth questioning why and revoking that access.\n\nSecurity experts recommend auditing your permissions periodically. Look at each app that has camera or microphone access and ask yourself whether it genuinely needs that capability to function. If the answer is no, turn off the permission.\n\nUnlike most phone features, you cannot disable the green privacy indicator. Both Apple and Google built these indicators as permanent security features specifically because users need to be aware when their sensors are active. The dot will appear every time an app accesses your camera, regardless of your settings.\n\nThis is by design. If users could turn off the indicator, it would defeat the purpose—malicious apps could access your camera without any visual warning. The permanence of the feature is part of what makes it useful as a security tool.\n\nAndroid 12 and later versions give users the ability to completely cut off camera and microphone access for all apps at once. In your Quick Settings panel, you'll find toggles labeled \"Camera Access\" and \"Mic Access\" that let you disable these features system-wide with a single tap.\n\nThis is useful when you want total privacy and don't want any app or service accessing your sensors. It's more comprehensive than managing individual app permissions and provides a quick way to ensure nothing can activate your hardware without you explicitly allowing it again.\n\nThe green dot on phones mirrors a feature that laptops have included for much longer. Most laptop webcams have a physical LED light that turns on whenever the camera is active. This hardware-based indicator has helped users know when video calls are active or when an application might be accessing their webcam unexpectedly.\n\nApple explicitly modeled the iPhone's green dot after the MacBook's webcam indicator, bringing the same transparency to mobile devices. The digital version serves the same purpose as the physical LED—alerting you when recording hardware is in use.\n\nIf you've checked permissions, closed all apps, and still see the green dot appearing inexplicably, security professionals suggest a factory reset as a last resort. This erases everything on your device and removes any potentially malicious software that might have embedded itself deeply in your system.\n\nBefore taking this step, back up your important data. After the reset, only reinstall apps you trust and need. This approach is drastic but effective when you genuinely suspect your device has been compromised and other troubleshooting steps haven't resolved the issue.",

    "description": "The CEO of Dhar Mann's studio said the company's videos offer comforting, uplifting messages, and their inclusive casting lets people see themselves.",
    "fullText": "Dhar Mann's morality tales about Karens getting exposed, kids with disabilities finding acceptance, and the like have made him one of the internet's most popular creators.\n\nHe also stands out in a mostly unscripted world for his focus on scripted content, including a recent micro-drama production deal with Fox.\n\nHis videos, shot in a 125,000 square-foot Burbank production studio, regularly run 20 minutes or longer and get upward of a million views on YouTube.\n\nSo, what makes his videos so successful? Sean Atkins, the CEO of Dhar Mann Studios, shared three factors.\n\nMann's videos are positive and uplifting.\n\nWith titles like \"Stepmom sabotages girl's dream,\" and \"Girl picks money over love in life,\" the storylines and characters are varied, but viewers know the underdogs will come out on top and the bad guys will get their comeuppance.\n\n\"Think about the world we live in right now,\" Atkins said. \"We just speak to the universal human condition that humans want to be entertained, and they want to feel good about themselves. It's predictable. The good guys win, bad guys lose.\"\n\nMann prioritizes diverse casting in his videos, which helps make them accessible to a wide swath of viewers.\n\n\"People see themselves, people of color, different disabilities, different belief systems,\" Atkins said. \"They're all treated equally, and they have access. We're run by multicultural founders. So people see themselves in the content. I think that just makes us one of those universal brands.\"\n\nDhar Mann Studios also puts a big focus on testing — typical of creators who rely on platforms that share a lot of performance data with them.\n\nAtkins, a former MTV and Discovery exec, estimated that creators like Mann have 10 times as much data as creators in the traditional entertainment space. The company has a data team that analyzes when viewers drop off and why, examining factors such as characters, colors used, and pacing. Editors test as many as three versions of each short video they put out into the world.\n\n\"Creators from Day 1 are drenched in data because you have the blessing or the curse, depending on the day you ask, that you sit on a platform that has all the data coming in in real time,\" Atkins said. \"So you can see as soon as you've posted, how's it performing? What's going on?\"",

    "fullText": "Ralph Lauren Collection designed the knee-length, powder-blue dress Melania wore to Trump's inauguration in 2017, along with the coordinating shrug and gloves.\n\nShe accessorized the outfit with pearl earrings and blue, pointed-toe heels.\n\nThe full ensemble evoked Jackie Kennedy's style. From the bright color to the nod to one of America's most iconic first ladies, Melania's look was the perfect choice for her husband's first inauguration.\n\nHervé Pierre custom-designed Melania's off-the-shoulder dress for the inaugural ball.\n\nThe cream dress had an A-line silhouette, a thigh-high slit on one side, and three-dimensional fabric that curved across the bodice. A thin red belt cinched at the waist for a pop of color.\n\nThe dress felt high-fashion, connecting the first lady to her past as a model as she stepped into a new role.\n\nIn August 2017, the Trumps visited Corpus Christi, Texas, following Hurricane Harvey to assess recovery efforts.\n\nThe pair wore casual attire, with Melania arriving in a white button-down, black jeans, and sneakers. She also added a black baseball hat to her look that said \"FLOTUS,\" first lady of the United States, on the front.\n\nMelania's outfit quickly became a source of social-media chatter. Some said her hat called attention to her in the wake of the natural disaster, while others praised her casual outfit.\n\nWhen greeting Justin and Sophie Grégoire Trudeau at the White House in October 2017, Melania wore a gray pinstripe suit instead of a dress.\n\nThe suit featured high-waisted pants, and she paired it with a white button-down and an untied black tie. The outfit was unexpected for a first lady, offering a fun style moment.\n\nMelania greeted President Macron of France and his wife, Brigitte, in a black minidress and black pumps at the White House.\n\nThe standout feature of her outfit was a Givenchy tuxedo cape, which added a flair of personality to the otherwise simple look.\n\nThe first lady changed into a silver Chanel dress for the dinner.\n\nMost of the form-fitting dress was covered in textured fabric, while the top of the bodice and bottom of the skirt were made of a sheer, black fabric adorned with silver embellishments.\n\nThe fabrics didn't blend well, making the dress look too busy. It would have been a better look without the sheer fabric.\n\nIn June 2018, Melania visited an immigration facility in McAllen, Texas, where children were living, wearing a green Zara jacket that said \"I really don't care, do u?\" on the back.\n\nCritics said the jacket was insensitive to wear for the visit, critiquing both the first lady and the president for the fashion faux pas.\n\nMelania's former aide, Stephanie Grisham, wrote in her book \"I'll Take Your Questions Now\" that the president yelled at Melania for wearing the jacket, though Trump and the first lady both said she wore it to send a message to the left-wing media.\n\nMelania wore a floor-length wrap dress from Ralph Lauren to celebrate Independence Day 2018.\n\nThe blue-and-white gingham dress was fun and festive for the holiday, but the oversize red belt tied at her waist overwhelmed the look.\n\nIf the first lady had swapped the bow for a thinner belt, her dress would have been more effective.\n\nMelania posed for photos in front of pyramids in Egypt wearing cream trousers, a white blouse, a black tie, and a sand-colored Ralph Lauren blazer. A white-and-black boater hat completed the look.\n\nThe outfit may have been innocuously stylish in a different venue, but some social-media users thought the outfit looked similar to one worn by \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" villain René Belloq during his visit to the pyramids in the film.\n\nIt wasn't the first time Melania faced criticism for one of her outfits on her visit to Africa. During her tour of the pyramids and the Great Sphinx, Melania told reporters, \"I wish people would focus on what I do, not what I wear,\" following backlash for wearing a white pith helmet.\n\n\"You know what? We just completed an amazing trip,\" she added. \"We went to Ghana, we went to Malawi, we went to Kenya, here we are in Egypt. I want to talk about my trip, not what I wear.\"\n\nDonald and Melania Trump arrived at the White House on the evening of December 27, holding hands as they walked across the lawn.\n\nWhile the president was in a suit, Melania wore a green jacket, light-brown pants, and matching shoes.\n\nThe pants might have been a better choice for a daytime look, as it was difficult for some to tell if the first lady was even wearing bottoms at first glance in the dark. The addition of sunglasses to her nighttime look was also an odd choice.\n\nMelania's outfit would have worked better during the day or with different pants.\n\nIn April 2019, the first lady was photographed at the White House in a black-and-white polka-dot dress designed by Alessandra Rich.\n\nThe high-neck dress was cinched at the waist with a black belt, coordinating with the dots on the dress, and it hit her mid-calf.\n\nMelania wore a cream coat over her shoulders and her signature sunglasses, adding glamour to the feminine look.\n\nDuring a visit to the UK, Melania attended a state dinner with the royal family in a Dior gown.\n\nA layer of semi-sheer fabric covered the gown's scooped neckline, forming points on the top of the bodice before transitioning into white fabric. The dress hugged her figure before flaring slightly at her waist.\n\nMelania wore white, elbow-length gloves with the dress. The look was fitting for dining with royalty.\n\nAhead of a dinner at Winfield House, where the American ambassador to the UK lives, Melania was photographed in a red Givenchy gown.\n\nMelania's floor-length dress was sleeveless and featured a built-in cape, a silhouette Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales, often favors.\n\nDuring another visit to the UK in December 2019, Melania stepped out in a high-neck, cape coat from Valentino. The coat was mustard yellow, and Melania paired it with a pink dress and coordinating pumps.\n\nThe jacket was a big statement in and of itself, so the look would have been more effective if the first lady had worn a more neutral color with it than bright pink.\n\nMelania's black Dior sundress was fairly simple. The midi-length dress featured a V-neckline and a white, dotted pattern.\n\nThe white lace belt from Alaïa and white Christian Louboutin pumps she wore with the dress made the look cohesive, and she also added sunglasses to the outfit.\n\nThe look balanced Melania's personal style and traditional first lady attire.\n\nMelania appeared alongside Trump in a hot-pink midi-dress from Jason Wu at the 2020 RNC.\n\nThe dress featured a boat neckline and a flared skirt, and two black bows sat on the waistline, which appeared to be cinched with elastic. Melania wore black pumps with the dress.\n\nThe bows on the dress could have been chic, but they looked a bit crumpled throughout the night, particularly because they sat atop the ruched waistline and contrasted so heavily with the pink fabric. The dress would have been a better fit if there had been just one or no bows on the waistline.\n\nMelania wore a cape dress to close out the RNC, choosing a neon-green piece from Valentino.\n\nThe ankle-length, high-neck dress was covered in vertical pleats and featured two swaths of fabric flowing out from her shoulders like a cape. She added a thin pink belt and pink pumps to the outfit.\n\nThe silhouette was beautiful, but the green color was an odd choice for the RNC. Vanity Fair reported that it allowed social-media users to easily make memes out of the outfit using green screen technology.\n\nIf she had worn the dress in a different color, Melania's look would have been a slam dunk.\n\nMelania oversaw the delivery of the 2020 White House Christmas tree in a gingham coat from Balenciaga.\n\nThe loose-fitting coat featured an off-center line of buttons, and the collar formed a scarf that wrapped around one of Melania's shoulders. Quarter-length sleeves showed off the first lady's black gloves, just as the knee-length hem spotlighted her black boots from Alaïa.\n\nThe look was effortlessly chic.\n\nWhen Trump left office in January 2021, Melania chose to wear an all-black outfit.\n\nShe paired a form-fitting Dolce & Gabbana dress with a cropped Chanel coat, gloves, Christian Louboutin pumps, and dark sunglasses.\n\nThe look seemed to nod to Jackie Kennedy, just as her first outfit as first lady did. However, the darker hues spoke to the more somber tone of the day for the Trumps.\n\nMelania also made headlines for changing into a beachy dress before arriving at Mar-a-Lago later in the day.\n\nRather than wearing another pastel look to mark the beginning of her husband's second term as president, Melania donned navy and white for the 2025 inauguration.\n\nAdam Lippes designed her coat, which she paired with a white scarf, navy pumps, and a custom boater-style hat from Eric Javits. Boater hats are typically worn in summer, but the wool piece Melania wore offered a winter version.\n\nAlthough the hat got some negative attention online as people compared it to the one the Hamburglar or V in \"V For Vendetta\" wore, Melania's inaugural outfit was a savvy choice. The look set a serious tone, blending professional style with Melania's personal taste.\n\nMelania also managed to pull attention from Trump with the look, which was a feat considering how many eyes he had on him throughout the day.\n\nTraditionally, Easter fashion calls for pastel tones and festive prints like gingham, allowing people to have fun with their outfits.\n\nHowever, Melania arrived at the 2025 Easter Egg Roll at the White House in a simple cream trench coat from Mackage and heels designed by Roger Vivier.\n\nThe subdued look was a shift from Melania's more colorful outfits for previous Easter celebrations at the White House. Likewise, Mackage, a brand founded and headquartered in Canada, was a surprising choice for the first lady, given the ongoing trade dispute between the US and its northern neighbor.\n\nMelania joined her husband at Pope Francis' funeral at St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City.\n\nShe wore a black coatdress designed by Dolce & Gabbana for the occasion, as well as lace gloves and a lace veil from the fashion house.\n\nWearing an Italian designer was fitting for the occasion since the Catholic Church is based in the country, though Melania also favors Dolce & Gabbana when she isn't in Italy.\n\nMelania chose a $3,900 Bottega Veneta dress for the show.\n\nThe dress had an asymmetrical neckline and gold detailing on the shoulder and waist. Melania paired the designer gown with silver and gold Christian Louboutin pumps.\n\nThe dress was pretty, but Melania's black and white looks for Trump's second term are starting to feel a bit repetitive. A pop of color could have made the dress stand out more.\n\nMelania appeared alongside Trump at the US Army's 250th anniversary parade in Washington, DC, wearing another suit from Adam Lippes.\n\nBoth her $2,490 jacket and $1,190 skirt were cream-colored, with a subtle navy pinstripe pattern. The double-breasted jacket and pencil skirt had a looser, relaxed fit.\n\nBlue Christian Louboutin heels completed the ensemble.\n\nOn September 4, Melania attended a meeting of the White House Task Force on Artificial Intelligence Education.\n\nShe wore a soft gray linen suit that featured white pinstripes. The jacket was oversized, and the pants were wide-legged. The first lady added structure to the look with a fitted white T-shirt and a white belt.\n\nStilettos completed the chic menswear look.\n\nOn September 16, the president and first lady arrived in the UK for a state visit. The following evening, they attended a state banquet with King Charles III, Queen Camilla, and other members of the royal family.\n\nMelania wore a bright yellow dress designed by Carolina Herrera to the dinner. The dress had an off-the-shoulder neckline, a column skirt, and a slit on the side. She added even more color to the ensemble with a wide, purple belt and bright green, dangly earrings.\n\nIt was nice to see Melania add some color to her wardrobe in 2025, but the bright hue and belt made the dress look a bit too casual for the event. The silhouette was pretty, but the first lady may have been better off wearing the gown in a more subdued color.\n\nOn September 23, Melania accompanied the president on a visit to the UN General Assembly, wearing a white blazer and tailored pants from Dolce & Gabbana.\n\nThe suit was a strong choice, as the contrast of the long blazer and cropped pants felt professional and chic, and the cream Christian Louboutin shoes she paired with the look were stylish, too.\n\nHowever, the camel-colored blouse from Max Mara that she wore with the suit was almost too close to Melania's skin tone. The look would have popped more with a different colored shirt.\n\nWhen the president and first lady passed out candy at the White House on Halloween, neither opted to wear a costume. Instead, Melania donned a wool coat from Marni, which nodded to the holiday with orange trim on the collar, pockets, and lining.\n\nShe wore the khaki-colored coat buttoned to the collar, and it cinched at her waist with a thick belt — one of her go-to silhouettes. She paired the coat with taupe Manolo Blahnik heels.\n\nWhile the orange aspects of the look had a subtle Halloween feel, the outfit just didn't feel festive enough for the holiday, especially when compared to the plethora of decorations covering the White House for the event. Melania would have made a stronger statement in a full orange coat or a black and orange look.\n\nOn November 18, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, dined at the White House during his visit to the US.\n\nMelania donned a $3,350 Elie Saab dress for the occasion. The deep-green dress featured a strapless neckline, and ruching on both the bodice and the skirt added texture. A slit broke up the floor-length skirt, and Melania completed the look with black heels and sparkly earrings.\n\nEvery bit of Melania's look seemed designed to welcome Crown Prince Mohammed. The dress was similar in color to Saudi Arabia's national flag, seeming to nod to the nation. Plus, in November 2024, Elie Saab marked 45 years of his brand with \"1001 Seasons of Elie Saab,\" a massive fashion show held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nMelania celebrated the end of 2025 at Trump's annual party at Mar-a-Lago wearing a sparkly, silver gown.\n\nDesigned by The New Arrivals, the $1,450 dress was sleeveless, with a scooped neckline, hugging Melania's figure as it flowed into a midi-length skirt. She paired the dress with bedazzled Christian Louboutin shoes and loose waves.\n\nThe look was festive and fitting for Florida weather, offering a refreshing change from her more subdued style.\n\nThe first lady attended the premiere of her documentary \"Melania\" in a Dolce & Gabbana skirt suit.\n\nBlack buttons lined the center of the jacket, which was cinched at Melania's waist with a black belt. The column skirt hid her mid-calf, spotlighting her black pumps.\n\nThe outfit might have been fine for any number of first lady engagements, but it felt too understated for the premiere of her film.\n\nA black gown with a professional flair may have been more appropriate for the occasion.",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame compared Elon Musk to Thomas Edison, but called the Tesla and SpaceX CEO a \"desperately incentivized futurist.\"",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry says Elon Musk is a true visionary — but the future he's building is much further away than he thinks.\n\n\"Elon is an American treasure but also a desperately incentivized futurist even earlier than me,\" the investor of \"The Big Short\" fame posted on X late Thursday.\n\nBurry, known for making premature but ultimately correct predictions, likely meant the Tesla and SpaceX CEO stands to profit enormously from his vision becoming reality, so he's highly motivated to hype it as much as he can.\n\n\"I am glad he is here in America,\" Burry wrote on his Substack. \"He will go down in history like PT Barnum and Thomas Edison,\" he added, referring to the legendary showman and founder of the Barnum & Bailey Circus, and the iconic inventor who helped refine the electric light bulb.\n\nFuturists are \"always decades early, even earlier than I am,\" Burry continued. \"And since they sell self-evident futures with indefinite timelines, they can raise capital.\"\n\nBurry attached a link to an article about Musk reportedly exploring a merger between SpaceX and either or both of his other main companies, Tesla and xAI.\n\nSpaceX was valued at $800 billion in a private share sale in December, Tesla has a $1.3 trillion market capitalization, and xAI was valued at $230 billion in a November fundraising round.\n\nBurry said it \"did not take a futurist to know this was coming,\" and the market had already priced in a potential combination. He added that $1.6 trillion \"more than encompasses\" what the trio are worth today, even accounting for their future value.\n\nThe value investor, who recently shifted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack, wrote that Tesla was \"ridiculously overvalued\" in a December post. He also warned that Musk's $1 trillion pay package would continue to dilute the company's shares.\n\nThat historic compensation deal underpins why Musk is so driven to market his vision and work toward realizing it. He's required to hit several milestones by 2035 to receive the full share allotment; those include raising Tesla's market value to $8.5 trillion, delivering 1 million robots, and bringing 1 million robotaxis into commercial service.\n\nAs for Musk's grand vision, he's repeatedly said he intends for humanity to colonize Mars in his lifetime. Moreover, he recently recommended people not save for retirement in 10 or 20 years, as he expects advances in AI, energy, and robotics to generate so many resources for all that nobody will need a nest egg.\n\nBurry has butted heads with Musk over the years. In 2021, he took aim at Tesla for its reliance on government subsidies and Musk for paring his stake in the EV maker.\n\nMusk responded by writing: \"Burry is a broken clock.\" He also teased Burry in 2022 about his previous short bet against Tesla.\n\nMusk hasn't responded to any of Burry's recent X posts, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "In a blow to the DOJ, a federal judge ruled that Luigi Mangione will not face the death penalty for the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
    "fullText": "Luigi Mangione will not face the death penalty in the 2024 ambush shooting and murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, a federal judge ruled on Friday.\n\nIn a written order issued an hour before a scheduled hearing in her Manhattan courtroom, US District Judge Margaret M. Garnett dismissed the two death penalty-eligible counts against Mangione.\n\nInstead, Mangione will face two fatal stalking counts at a trial that could begin in October: crossing state lines to cause Thompson's death, and using the internet to plan and carry out the CEO's death.\n\nBoth charges carry a maximum possible punishment of life in prison without parole.\n\nIn her order, Garnett used the word \"absurdity\" to describe the \"legal infirmities\" of the two charges she dismissed.\n\nBoth charges had required proof of stalking as being, in itself, a crime of violence, a requirement she said prosecutors failed to demonstrate.\n\nDuring the months he allegedly planned the murder, Mangione failed to place the CEO \"in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily harm\" or cause him \"emotional distress,\" as required by the statute, she wrote.\n\nThompson was unaware of Mangione's actions prior to being shot from behind outside a Manhattan hotel on December 4, 2024, according to prosecutors' own account of the killing.\n\n\"The stalking offenses charged in counts one and two are not 'crimes of violence' as a matter of law, and counts three and four must be dismissed,\" she wrote.\n\nProsecutors said Friday that they have not decided if they will appeal the judge's ruling.\n\nUS Attorney Pam Bondi announced in April that prosecutors will seek the death penalty.\n\n\"Luigi Mangione's murder of Brian Thompson — an innocent man and father of two young children — was a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America,\" Bondi wrote then.\n\n\"After careful consideration, I have directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case as we carry out President Trump's agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.\"\n\nIn a separate ruling Friday morning, the judge said she would allow the jury to see the most serious evidence against Mangione: The contents of his backpack, which, upon his arrest, contained a gun and a journal linked to the killing.",

    "description": "Melania Trump was joined by her husband and political allies at the premiere of her new film. Many of them wore simple, blue outfits for the occasion.",
    "fullText": "There was a surprising lack of \"MAGA red\" at the premiere of Melania Trump's new movie.\n\nThe first lady, her husband, and their political allies walked the red carpet at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., on Thursday night to support the film, \"Melania,\" which hits theaters Friday.\n\nThere were no \"Make America Great Again\" hats or vibrant red suits in sight, though. Instead, attendees arrived in a mix of understated looks, American flag pins, and, most interestingly, blue ensembles.\n\nHere's a closer look at what attendees wore.\n\nDonald Trump posed outside the premiere in a navy suit, wearing an American flag pin on his lapel and a burgundy tie.\n\nMelania, on the other hand, chose an all-black ensemble from Italian fashion brand Dolce & Gabbana. It comprised a straight skirt, a buttoned blazer with a thin belt, and pointed leather heels.\n\nThe outfit fit her subdued style, which she's worn throughout this presidential term. Her hair, now gold and brown, was styled in her signature waves.\n\nHe paired his pinstriped set with a white button-up shirt and an extra-skinny tie.\n\nThe latter was blue and printed with a pattern of small red crab shapes.\n\nDr. Oz and his son, Oliver, matched in blue satin suits, black dress shoes, and red ties.\n\nThe women of the family took the same approach, but with a different color palette. Lisa Oz wore a brown satin dress with gold heels and matching earrings, while Daphne Oz donned a glittering brown dress with velvet boots and a diamond necklace.\n\nHer $9,900 off-the-shoulder gown from Schiaparelli featured a floor-length skirt, all-over ruching, and a keyhole-shaped cutout down its bodice.\n\nShe wore it with dangling earrings and thick gold arm cuffs. The rapper's hair was styled in a sleek, straight look with bangs.\n\nPete Hegseth wore an ocean-blue suit with a white button-up shirt, a polka-dot tie, and brown leather dress shoes.\n\nHis wife, Jennifer, however, took a more glitzy approach. She wore a sequin-covered pantsuit with short sleeves, a V-neckline, and a black belt.\n\nShe wore the purple-and-blue ensemble with black heels and a matching clutch.\n\nThe current Secretary of Education was photographed at the movie premiere wearing a blue knee-length dress beneath a faux-fur white coat.\n\nShe also sported a silver necklace, diamond earrings, and navy loafers.",

    "description": "Whenever I'm traveling solo, I turn to dating apps like Hinge to source recommendations from locals. I've found that most matches are happy to help.",
    "fullText": "Being spontaneous and going with the flow when traveling might sound romantic and adventurous, but I believe the best experiences come with a bit of prep work.\n\nSaving a list of places to visit on Google Maps gives me a sense of orientation when I arrive somewhere new — but when those pins come from algorithm-fed videos, influencers, and glossy listicles, I find they often miss the mark.\n\nCreators and I rarely share the same definition of what's worth seeing or eating, and media roundups can sometimes lack a personal touch.\n\nThat's why trusted insider tips remain my favorite way to get recommendations. Unfortunately, not every destination I travel to comes with a friend ready to share their carefully curated list of local gems.\n\nSo, I use dating apps. A few days before a trip, I change my Hinge location to a cool neighborhood in the city I'm visiting and ask locals for suggestions.\n\nThrough a mix of profile curation and the questions I ask my matches, I make my intentions clear from the start. And usually, people are happy to provide recommendations.\n\nRecently, while planning a trip to Istanbul, I set my location to Kadıköy. Within an hour, I had more than 50 locals ready for a chat.\n\nA quick, \"Hey, it's my first time visiting the city. Do you have any tips?\" is often enough to get the conversation going.\n\nTo make things even easier, I sometimes change one of my profile prompts to something that invites recommendation-giving. From Hinge's long list, there are plenty that work:\n\nFrom their responses — and their profiles (age, occupation, interests) — it's easy to tell if our tastes align and know who to ask for specific recommendations.\n\nFor example, I can ask an architect about a local building he thinks is underrated or a runner about the best nearby park for a morning run.\n\nIf the conversation flows, the person genuinely piques my curiosity, and I've got time in my itinerary, I sometimes meet my virtual guides in person.\n\nWhen I do, my usual dating safety rules apply: We meet in public (preferably in daylight), I share my location with someone I trust, I don't drink too much, and I always watch my drink.\n\nRomance is never completely off the table — who says you can't mix business with pleasure? However, most of my matches have remained on the app or turned into Instagram friendships.\n\nThrough these encounters, my matches have scored me discounts at their friends' stores, invited me to parties filled with locals, and even guided me on personalized bar-hopping adventures.\n\nI've found that most people naturally like to help others and to show their city in the best possible light. And if the chat is pleasant, I encourage them to reach out when they're in my city so I can return the favor.\n\nThis travel hack might be a single-person privilege. However, in times when main courses can sometimes only be ordered for two, there aren't many perks left — so let us have this one.",

    "fullText": "Flights to Venezuela are back on the cards for the first time in six years.\n\nNearly four weeks after the US launched military strikes in the country and captured Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump announced plans to airlines to resume flights to the country.\n\n\"We're going to be opening up all commercial airspace over Venezuela,\" Trump said on Thursday. \"American citizens will be very shortly able to go to Venezuela and they'll be safe there.\"\n\nLate Thursday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy rescinded a 2019 order that barred US airlines from flying to Venezuela, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration also said it had removed four notices to airmen in the Caribbean region, including one related to Venezuela.\n\n\"These NOTAMs were issued as precautionary measures and are no longer necessary,\" it said. \"Safety remains our top priority, and we look forward to facilitating the return of regular travel between the US and Venezuela.\"\n\nNearly 1,000 flights to and from the Caribbean were canceled when the region's airspace was closed for 24 hours due to the military activity earlier this month. Some travelers spent thousands of dollars extra as they spent an extra week away from home.\n\nAmerican Airlines said on Thursday that it was \"proud to be the first airline to announce plans\" to reinstate flights to Venezuela.\n\nHowever, it could be some time before tickets are on sale.\n\nIn its announcement, American said it would share additional details \"in the coming months.\"\n\nIt added that it was working with federal authorities \"on all necessary permissions and security assessments prior to resuming service.\"\n\nAmerican first started serving Venezuela in 1987 and said it was the biggest operator there before suspending flights in 2019.\n\nThat year saw the country's political situation deteriorate as Venezuela's national assembly declared Maduro's reelection was invalid.\n\n\"We have a more than 30-year history connecting Venezolanos to the US, and we are ready to renew that incredible relationship,\" said Nat Pieper, American's chief commercial officer.\n\n\"By restarting service to Venezuela, American will offer customers the opportunity to reunite with families and create new business and commerce with the United States,\" he added.",

    "description": "Economist Paul Krugman criticized Trump's trade tactics, highlighting risks of economic isolation as trade partners gravitate more toward the EU.",
    "fullText": "Paul Krugman thinks Americans will ultimately be the biggest losers of chaotic US trade policy.\n\nThe Nobel Prize-winning economist thinks Donald Trump's trade policies and aggressive negotiating tactics are spurring global instability that will eventually come back to bite the US.\n\nAnd despite his recent focus on affordability, Krugman thinks that Trump's trade maneuvers will harm American consumers who are already struggling.\n\nOther economists and market commentators have raised similar alarms. Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi has predicted that tariffs could push the US into a recession, and hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio recently speculated that they could lead to capital wars on the global level.\n\nIn a Substack post, Krugman highlighted the problems he sees with Trump's focus on strong-arming other countries into making a deal.\n\n\"Now US economic relations with other nations have turned abusive, and the world is moving toward divorce,\" he said. \"And this will make Americans measurably poorer.\"\n\nAs a result of this \"divorce,\" US trade partners will make more deals with each other and fewer with the US.\n\nA recent study has said that American consumers are being forced to shoulder almost the entire cost of Trump's tariffs, but now Krugman thinks they're about to be stuck with another bill as Trump continues to use tariffs as a negotiating tool.\n\nIn Krugman's view, trade data show how other nations value access to the EU more than the US.\n\n\"This measure tells us how much of other countries' output they sell to the United States,\" Krugman noted. \"The answer, on average, is less than 5 percent, and much lower when you exclude Canada and Mexico.\"\n\nThe economist added that the number also doubles when computed for the EU. Put simply, when the total output of other countries is added up, twice as much is sold to the EU as to the US.\n\nOther nations are aware of this and are seeking to distance themselves from the US in favor of remaining on good terms with the EU, he said. Krugman used the example of India's recent trade deal with the EU to highlight the trend of \"economic divorce\" that he sees.\n\n\"Unlike Donald Trump, who thinks of international trade as a zero-sum game, the Europeans and the Indians understand that a free trade agreement between them is a very good deal for both parties,\" he said.",

    "description": "A key GOP senator is vowing to oppose Warsh's nomination until the DOJ probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell is resolved. Here's why that's a big deal.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has a Jerome Powell-sized problem with installing Kevin Warsh as the new Fed chair.\n\nA key Republican senator has vowed to oppose the confirmation of any nominee to be the next Federal Reserve chairman until the Department of Justice's probe into Powell, the current chair, is resolved.\n\nThat senator — Thom Tillis of North Carolina — happens to sit on the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, which considers Fed chair nominations. If all Democrats join Tillis in opposing Warsh's confirmation, Warsh's nomination will effectively be stuck in committee.\n\nIn a post on X on Friday, Tillis made clear that he has nothing against Warsh, who has otherwise been lauded as a strong pick by both Republicans and economists.\n\n\"Kevin Warsh is a qualified nominee with a deep understanding of monetary policy,\" Tillis wrote, later adding: \"Protecting the independence of the Federal Reserve from political interference or legal intimidation is non-negotiable.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Powell revealed that the DOJ issued grand jury subpoenas to the Federal Reserve related to recent renovations at the building.\n\nPowell called the probe an effort to exert pressure on the central bank's monetary policy, and central bankers from around the world have rallied to Powell's defense.\n\nTrump has said that he had no knowledge of the subpoenas before Powell made them public.\n\nIn a statement, White House spokesman Kush Desai said that Warsh is \"eminently qualified to serve\" as the next Fed chair and that the White House \"looks forward to working with the Senate to quickly confirm him and get the Federal Reserve back on track.\"\n\nTrump appeared unmoved by Tillis's opposition, telling reporters in the Oval Office later on Friday that it's \"too bad.\"\n\nHe also suggested that Warsh's confirmation may have to wait until Tillis is out of office. The North Carolina senator's term ends in January 2027.\n\n\"If he doesn't approve, we'll just have to wait until somebody comes in that will approve it,\" Trump said.\n\nUnder Senate rules, before the full chamber can vote on a nominee, it must be reported \"favorably\" by the committee with jurisdiction, which requires a majority vote.\n\nDemocrats are expected to broadly oppose Warsh's confirmation, with many raising concerns about the independence of the Fed.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the committee, said in a statement on Friday that \"no Republican purporting to care about Fed independence should agree to move forward with this nomination\" under the circumstances.\n\nIf Tillis and every Democrat vote against Warsh's nomination, that leads to a deadlocked 12-12 committee vote.\n\nIt would take 60 votes in the Senate to bypass that committee vote and bring his nomination to the floor — an unlikely prospect, given that it requires Democratic support.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune has acknowledged the predicament. According to POLITICO, when asked on Thursday whether Warsh could be confirmed without Tillis's support, Thune said: \"Uh, probably not.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Tillis opted not to seek reelection, making it far more difficult for Trump to exert pressure on him to change his mind.",

It states that the decision will improve customer satisfaction, \"strengthen our culture of innovation,\" and create more opportunities for mentorship and skill development.\n\nA set of guidelines entitled \"Back Together We Win,\" sent with the email, describes the five-day-a-week RTO as an \"enterprise-wide initiative\" that will apply to all employees in all regions, not just the US.\n\nIt notes that timings will vary by country as some regions may require \"additional capacity for their facilities to accommodate their workforce.\"\n\n\"Under new guidelines, US employees will transition to a fully onsite schedule over the next two months to further strengthen alignment, teamwork, and hands-on engagement with Stellantis vehicles and technologies,\" a Stellantis spokesperson told Business Insider. \"This announcement is confirmation that bringing teams together to build stronger connections is a competitive necessity.\"\n\nAccording to the guidelines sent to employees on Friday, employees would be required to confirm specific on-site working hours with their managers and teams.\n\n\"While we continue to support flexibility in work hours, employees are expected to spend the majority of their workday on-site,\" the document read.\n\nIt also outlined several resources employees could access to support the transition, including discounts on childcare and 10 free counselling sessions a year available through an employee assistance program.\n\nStellantis told US employees they needed to be in the office three to five days last March. The company employed nearly 250,000 people globally as of the end of 2024, per financial filings.\n\nThe auto conglomerate, which includes European brands such as Fiat and Alfa Romeo, as well as US labels Jeep and Ram, follows several rivals in updating its working-from-home policies.\n\nFord told employees last June that they would be required to be in the office at least four days a week from September, and warned some workers that they could face termination if they did not comply.\n\nIn January 2025, meanwhile, Toyota told employees in North America they would also be required to attend the office four days a week from September.\n\nStellantis has endured significant turmoil in recent years, with the conglomerate's US sales struggling and its stock price underperforming rivals Ford and GM.\n\nCarlos Tavares, who had led the company since its formation in 2021, stepped down as CEO in December 2024 and was subsequently replaced by former Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa.",

    "fullText": "Tapping an American Express card is, more and more, a young person's game.\n\nFor the first time, millennials and Gen Zers made up the biggest slice of US consumer spending among all Amex consumer cardholders last quarter, CFO Christophe Le Caillec said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. They're also the fastest-growing cohort, he said, as Amex works to target younger consumers. To date, the average new consumer customer for the Platinum and Gold cards is 33 and 29, respectively. (The Platinum card costs $895 a year, compared to the Gold card's annual fee of $325.)\n\nAmex's customers were spending to fund their lifestyles, especially when it came to eating out and traveling. In the fourth quarter, cardholders' retail spending rose 10%, compared with 15% at luxury retailers, Le Caillec said. Amex refreshed its Platinum card in September, and the CFO said that the number of new cardholders was up \"significantly.\"\n\nRestaurants saw a boom, especially those that partner with Resy, the reservation platform owned by Amex. Spending at restaurants was up 9% for the quarter, compared with up 20% at Resy venues, CEO Stephen Squeri said later in the call. Under the newest Platinum perks, cardholders can receive up to $400 in annual credit at Resy restaurants and attend \"Platinum Nights\" at select spots in New York, Los Angeles, and Miami.\n\n\"That synergy has really worked out very, very well for us,\" Squeri said of the partnership with Resy.\n\nHe added that the Platinum refresh has made it easier for cardholders to enroll in benefits, and the card provider saw a 30% surge in travel bookings in the last three months of 2025.\n\n\"That is a direct result of that Platinum launch and the engagement of our cardholders,\" he said.\n\nWhen it comes to non-premium spenders, Squeri predicted that President Donald Trump's proposed one-year cap on credit cards would be harmful.\n\n\"Affordability is really important. I don't think a 10% credit card cap is the answer to that. I think it would reduce the number of cards ultimately in the marketplace,\" Squeri said, largely echoing the opinions of other financial leaders.\n\nThe cap, if enacted, could reduce the number of cards in the market and negatively impact small businesses: \"It just has this sort of effect of a downward spiral.\"",

    "description": "A group inside Google is trying to upskill the workforce with better AI tools and practices, internal documents show.",
    "fullText": "A project inside Google is attempting to supercharge employees with cutting-edge AI abilities — and hopes to turn the company into an \"AI-powered workplace.\"\n\nThe initiative, codenamed \"Project EAT,\" was spun up inside Google's \"AI and Infrastructure\" unit, according to internal documents reviewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe unit, internally abbreviated AI2 and led by company veteran Amin Vahdat, spearheads work on data centers, chips, and other key ingredients that underpin Google's AI technologies.\n\nAccording to internal documents, Project EAT was created to help employees adopt various AI products and standardize their use across the organization.\n\nProject EAT was created in May 2025 and began as a grassroots initiative among employees, a Google spokesperson told Business Insider. They added that it has led to the creation of some AI productivity tools that Googlers across the company are now using.\n\nIt comes as Google leaders, like those at other tech companies, are pushing for employees across the company to adopt AI into their workflows.\n\nPer an internal mission statement for Project EAT, the goal is to ensure AI2 is at the cutting edge of AI — from productivity tools to coding.\n\n\"We envision a future where Google is transformed into an AI-powered workplace, leading to dramatically higher productivity, greater employee engagement and collaboration, improved quality of work, better work-life balance, and greater product innovation across the company,\" it reads.\n\n\"We aim to lead Google into this vision by first leading this organizational change within AI2.\"\n\nWhile Google is aggressively shipping AI tools to customers and businesses, it's also fast adopting AI tools and practices internally.\n\nLast June, engineering VP Megan Kacholia sent an email telling engineers to use AI for coding, Business Insider reported. Shortly after, CEO Sundar Pichai sent a clear message to staff: our rivals are using AI, and we need to do the same to compete.\n\nGoogle appointed Vahdat to lead its infrastructure group last year, and in December, he was promoted to senior vice president, reporting directly to Pichai. Vahdat played a key role in shaping Google's strategy with its AI chips, known as TPUs, and has spearheaded Google's efforts to build out its AI infrastructure.\n\nAs tech companies pour billions into AI capital expenditure, a huge share of it at Google is going into Vahdat's org. A Google spokesperson told Business Insider that A12 employs more than several thousand people.\n\nAn internal FAQ for the Project EAT page, reviewed by Business Insider, states that it had a 12-week seed-stage. It notes that this included a push for state-of-the-art code assistance tools within the AI2 org and that the test period resulted in \"promising signs of improved developer velocity, reduced toil, and enhanced code quality.\"\n\nThe name Project EAT is a reference to Google employees eating their own dog food, a spokesperson confirmed. Dogfooding is a common practice at tech companies where employees internally test and iterate products before launching them to market.\n\nInternal documents suggest EAT is pilot-testing new AI products and standards within AI2, with the goal of eventually adopting them across the company. \"The primary goal of Project EAT is to dramatically accelerate the adoption and integration of Google and 3rd party AI technologies within Al2.\"\n\nIt adds: \"We expect to improve standard practices across engineering, product management, TPM, and operations, thereby mitigating risks associated with the rapidly evolving external AI landscape and ensuring Google's technological leadership.\"\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "A Florida nurse who said he would not \"perform anesthesia\" for \"MAGA\" patients has relinquished his license.\n\n\"Effective today, Erik Martindale is no longer a registered nurse in Florida,\" Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier wrote in an X post Thursday.\n\n\"Healthcare is not contingent on political beliefs, and we have zero tolerance for partisans who put politics above their ethical duty to treat patients with the respect and dignity they deserve,\" he added.\n\nFlorida Attorney General Demands Nursing Board Revoke License Of Nurse Who Wished Injury On Karoline Leavitt\n\nIn a since-deleted post on social media, Martindale said, \"I will not perform anesthesia for any surgeries or procedures for MAGA. It is my right, it is my ethical oath, and I stand behind my education. I own all of my businesses and I can refuse anyone!\"\n\nMartindale later said that his Facebook account was hacked.\n\nA high-ranking state official familiar with the situation confirmed that Martindale relinquished his license, adding he broke the compact agreement by moving out of state to Indiana without notifying the Florida Board of Nursing.\n\nPolice Investigate Vcu Nurse Who Instructed 'Sabotage' Of Ice Agents In Viral Tiktok Videos\n\nThe portal bearing Martindale’s license number and license verification on the Florida Department of Health’s website says he voluntarily relinquished his license in the \"license status\" field.

    "fullText": "Snow chances have increased for Beaufort County this weekend, with the National Weather Service now estimating an 89% probability of snow falling on Saturday.\n\nConfidence continues to grow that an accumulating snowfall event will impact the region from Saturday morning into the night, driven by unseasonably cold air and a reinforcing Arctic high pressure system expected to settle over the area late Friday and persist through Monday.\n\nWhile some uncertainty remains about the exact timing and amounts, meteorologists say precipitation will likely begin as a rain and snow mix before transitioning to all snow as temperatures fall. A rain and sleet mix is not expected.\n\nSnow is expected to begin around 9 a.m. Saturday, with Beaufort County most likely seeing snowfall between noon and 7 p.m.\n\nHilton Head is forecast to see a 70% chance of precipitation Saturday, most likely before 4 p.m., with snow accumulation of less than half an inch possible. High temperatures will reach about 44 degrees.\n\nIn Beaufort, forecasters expect a 70% chance of precipitation early afternoon Saturday, transitioning to a rain and snow mix between 1 and 4 p.m. Snow is expected to come later in the afternoon and evening. High temperatures could reach near 43 degrees; snow accumulation is expected to remain under half an inch.\n\nThe coldest conditions will persist from Saturday night and into Sunday morning, with lows dipping into the 20s for both Hilton Head and Beaufort. Wind chills may drop to 10 degrees or colder.\n\nFor the most updated information, visit the NWS webpage.",

    "description": "Luigi Mangione will not face the death penalty after a U.S. judge on Friday dismissed murder and weapons charges against the accused",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Luigi Mangione will not face the death penalty after a U.S. judge on Friday dismissed murder and weapons charges against the accused killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian ​Thompson, in a major blow to federal prosecutors.\n\nU.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett in Manhattan said she felt constrained by Supreme ‌Court precedents to dismiss the murder charge, saying it was legally incompatible with the two stalking charges Mangione still faces, while acknowledging that ordinary people might be ‌dumbfounded by the outcome.\n\nMangione, 27, still faces possible life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted on the stalking charges.\n\nDominic Gentile, a federal prosecutor, told Garnett at a routine court hearing on Friday the government has not decided whether it will appeal.\n\nThompson, who led UnitedHealth Group's health insurance business, was shot and killed on December 4, 2024 outside the Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan.\n\nMangione pleaded not guilty to all ⁠charges stemming from Thompson's death, and has been ‌jailed since his arrest in Pennsylvania five days after the killing.\n\nWhile public officials widely condemned Thompson's killing, Mangione became a folk hero of sorts to many Americans who decry high costs for medical care ‍and health insurer practices.\n\nGarnett has scheduled jury selection in the case to begin in September, with the evidence phase of trial beginning October 12.\n\nMangione has also pleaded not guilty to separate murder, weapons and forgery charges in a New York state court in Manhattan.\n\nNo trial date in that case has been ​set. Prosecutors in that case suffered their own setback in September, when the judge dismissed two terrorism-related counts against Mangione.\n\nJUDGE ACKNOWLEDGES 'TORTURED AND ‌STRANGE' LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\nIn a 39-page decision, Garnett said federal prosecutors could pursue their murder and weapons charges only if the stalking charges qualified as \"crimes of violence.\"\n\nShe said the charges did not qualify because any use of force could be achieved through reckless, as opposed to intentional, conduct.\n\nThe judge said prosecutors and Mangione agreed that this fell short of the kind of \"force\" the Supreme Court required to make out a crime of violence.\n\nGarnett acknowledged the \"apparent absurdity\" of the legal landscape, saying no one would seriously question that Mangione's alleged conduct -- crossing state ⁠lines to kill a specific healthcare executive with a handgun equipped with ​a silencer -- was violent criminal conduct.\n\nShe said her analysis may strike ordinary people, ​and many lawyers and judges, as \"tortured and strange,\" but it \"represents the court's committed effort to faithfully apply the dictates of the Supreme Court to the charges in this case. The law must be the court's only concern.\"\n\nIn ‍a separate decision, Garnett rejected Mangione's ⁠bid to exclude evidence seized from his backpack when he was arrested.\n\nMangione argued that evidence found in the backpack, including a 9-millimeter pistol, silencer and journal entries, should be suppressed because police obtained it without a warrant.\n\nThe judge said it ⁠was standard practice for local police to search closed bags that might reasonably contain dangerous objects, and the police had probable cause to conduct a search. She ‌also said the contents would have been discovered inevitably through a federal search warrant.",

(AP) — NASA has delayed astronauts’ upcoming trip to the moon because of near-freezing temperatures expected at the launch site.\n\nThe first Artemis moonshot with a crew is now targeted for no earlier than Feb. 8, two days later than planned.\n\nNASA was all set to conduct a fueling test of the 322-foot (98-meter) moon rocket on Saturday, but called everything off late Thursday because of the expected cold.\n\nThe critical dress rehearsal is now set for Monday, weather permitting. The change leaves NASA with only three days in February to send four astronauts around the moon and back, before slipping into March.\n\n\"Any additional delays would result in a day for day change,\" NASA said in a statement Friday.\n\nHeaters are keeping the Orion capsule warm atop the rocket, officials said, and rocket-purging systems are also being adapted to the cold.\n\nCommander Reid Wiseman and his crew remain in quarantine in Houston and their arrival at Kennedy Space Center in Florida is uncertain.\n\nNASA has only a handful of days any given month to launch its first lunar crew in more than half a century. Apollo 17 closed out that storied moon exploration program in 1972.\n\nComplicating matters is the need to launch a fresh crew to the International Space Station as soon as possible, a mission accelerated because of the last crew's early return for medical reasons.\n\nThe moonshot will take priority if it can get off by Feb. 11, the last possible launch date for the month, mission managers said Friday.\n\nIf that happens, the next station crew will have to wait until the Artemis astronauts are back on Earth before launching later in the month.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    "fullText": "A couple in the United States are suing a fertility clinic after they gave birth to a baby with the “appearance of a racially non-Caucasian child”.\n\nTiffany Score and Steven Mills conceived through in vitro fertilisation (IVF), but later discovered that the child was not biologically theirs.\n\nThey only realised when the baby was born with a different ethnicity to her parents, who are both white.\n\nGenetic testing then confirmed that the baby girl was not genetically related to them.\n\nThe pair suspect that IVF Life – which operates as the Fertility Centre of Orlando in Longwood, Florida – mistakenly implanted the wrong embryo in Ms Score.\n\nThey filed the lawsuit on Jan 22 after allegedly making multiple attempts to contact the clinic without receiving a response.\n\nMs Score and Mr Mills said that they “love our little girl” and would like to raise her as their own if allowed.\n\n“We would hope to be able to continue to raise her ourselves with confidence that she won’t be taken away from us,” they said in a statement to News6.\n\n“At the same time, we are aware that we have a moral obligation to find and notify her biological parents, as it is in her best interest that her genetic parents are provided the option to raise her as their own.”\n\nMs Score and Mr Mills also fear that one of the three embryos they had frozen at the clinic may have been mistakenly implanted into another patient, potentially meaning someone else could be pregnant with or raising their biological child.\n\nThe lawsuit asks that the clinic account for the couple’s remaining embryos.\n\nThe pair have requested that the clinic share all information relating to other patients who also had embryos stored at the facility during the year Score gave birth to the child.\n\nThey also want IVF Life to fund the genetic testing of each child born following the clinic’s work over the past five years.\n\nThe lawsuit names IVF Life LLC and Dr Milton McNichol, who operates the clinic, according to the Orlando Sentinel.\n\nJack Scarola, one of the couple’s lawyers, told the newspaper that the couple “have fallen in love with this child”.\n\nHe added: “They would be thrilled in the knowledge that they could raise this child. But their concern is that this is someone else’s child, and someone could show up at any time and claim the baby and take that baby away from them.”\n\nA family spokesman said that an investigation into the situation is ongoing.\n\n“Based upon leads discovered to date, and despite the lack of help or cooperation from the clinic, there is hope that we will be able to introduce our daughter to her genetic parents and to find our own genetic child soon,” they told the Daily Mail.\n\nThe Telegraph has contacted the Fertility Centre for comment.\n\nThe facility previously shared a statement seemingly referring to Ms Score and Mr Mills’ concerns, but it was taken down after a court hearing on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to reports, it said the clinic was “actively cooperating with an investigation to support one of our patients in determining the source of an error that resulted in the birth of a child who is not genetically related to them”.\n\nDr McNichol was reprimanded by Florida’s Board of Medicine in May 2024 following an inspection of the clinic in June 2023 that uncovered multiple violations.\n\nPublic records show that the facility did not have a correct list of staff who worked there on its register while equipment “did not meet current performance standards”. There was also a failure to follow a risk‑management plan and missing medications.\n\nHe was fined $5,000 for the infractions.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Steam Deck Owner Should Know",
    "description": "You can access games from other stores, make your screen more colorful, and make emulation easy.",
    "fullText": "Valve's Steam Deck revolutionized PC gaming when it came out in 2022, popularizing the handheld gaming PC format. In 2026, it's still got a great performance-to-price ratio, and is plenty relevant compared to more expensive and more finicky alternatives like the Asus Rog Xbox Ally X. But that doesn't mean it's fully stacked right out of the box. SteamOS presents a more intuitive pick-up-and-play experience than I've used on any other handheld gaming PC (or gaming PC in general, to be honest), but there are plenty of hacks and customizations you can use to make it truly yours.\n\nThis one's simple, but vastly increases what you can do with your Steam Deck. Yes, the Steam Deck's biggest strength is that you can easily hop into games right from the home screen using the built-in controls, but did you know that you can also use it like a more traditional desktop?\n\nTo swap the device over to its built-in desktop mode, press the Steam button (the one on the device itself), then select Power. From there, select Switch to Desktop.\n\nBam, you'll be taken right to a more traditional PC interface, and one that will look extra familiar to you if you've ever used Linux, the base operating system SteamOS is built on.\n\nYou'll need desktop mode to enable a lot of the other hacks on this list, but it's also great on its own. With it, you can install your favorite Linux productivity apps, or even just browse the web using Microsoft Edge, which comes pre-installed (you can install your browser of choice later). You can use the right trackpad, the thumbsticks, or the touchscreen to move the mouse cursor, and press Steam + X to bring up a keyboard, but you can also plug in an external accessory or dock using the USB-C port on top of the device, too. Play this right, and you can basically turn the Steam Deck into a full-fledged Mini PC, complete with a built-in screen.\n\nTo leave desktop mode and re-enter the Steam Deck's default interface, click on the Return to Gaming mode icon in your desktop's top left corner.\n\nThere are a few ways to do this, but by far, the most convenient one is Heroic Launcher. This allows you to install games from your Epic Game Store, Amazon, and GOG libraries by picking them from a handy, scrollable list.\n\nInstalling Heroic Game Launcher is easy. First, go to desktop mode, then click on the Discover store, which is the little shopping bag icon to the left of the folder icon. Search for Heroic, and install the app called Heroic (it'll likely be the first entry, and will have an icon that looks like a shield with a sword in it).\n\nOnce it's installed, open it, either by clicking the shortcut on your desktop or by searching for it using SteamOS' version of the classic Windows Start menu (it'll be to the far left of your taskbar, and will look like the Steam Deck logo).\n\nFrom here, log into your various alternative game launcher accounts using the Log in button in the top left corner. After that, you could simply install your games and stop here, navigating to desktop mode and opening Heroic Launcher every time you want to play them. But let's go one step further, so you can access them right from gaming mode (the Steam Deck's default interface).\n\nFirst, let's try installing a game of your choice from the Library tab, to get used to the process. Select the game you want to install, then click Install. You may see the option to change the Install Path or change the \"Wine\" settings. The latter can help with compatibility, but you likely won't need to mess with these. You may need to allow a C++ install to actually run certain games, but you can simply click \"Install\" on the pop-up that shows up when you try running these games to do this.\n\nOnce your game is installed, click the three-dot menu in the top right corner and select Add to Steam. This will add the game to your Steam library, so you can open it right from the handheld's gaming mode.\n\nYou could also stop here, just adding games to Steam on a case-by-case basis. But for ultimate convenience, you can add Heroic Launcher itself to the Steam Deck's gaming mode, to make accessing games in it easier. To do this, click the Steam shortcut on your desktop (or open it from the \"Start\" menu). From here, click the Add a game button in the bottom left corner, next to the plus sign. Click Add a Non-Steam Game, and in the list that pops up, find and click on Heroic Game Launcher. Click Add Selected Programs.\n\nWith this, you'll be able to access Heroic Game Launcher from within gaming mode by navigating to Library > Non-Steam. This is also where any games you've added to Steam from Heroic Game Launcher will show up, and you can use these same steps to add and view other third-party apps within Steam too, even mainstays like Google Chrome. You'll notice that the art for these might be a little barren. There are a few ways to fix this, but I'll touch on my favorite below.\n\nUnlike Heroic Launcher, Decky Loader needs to be installed from a browser. Enter desktop mode, open your browser of choice (Edge is the default), then navigate to decky.xyz. From here, click Download in the top-right corner. Find the install file, either from your browser or the Steam Deck's File Manager (the folder icon in the taskbar) under Downloads. Double click on it, and then proceed with the installation. For the most stable experience, choose the recommended install option.\n\nNow, to actually use Decky Loader, go back to gaming mode and press the physical three-dot button on your Steam Deck (I'll refer to that as the \"quick settings button\" for the rest of this article). Scroll down to the Decky Loader menu, which looks like a plug. Here's where you can start toying with your plugins.\n\nYou've got a number of options here, so let's navigate through where to find plugins and what some of my favorites are. First, select the icon that looks like a market stall (in the top-right corner), and from here, you'll see all available plugins.\n\nNote that, sometimes, installing a new Steam Deck system update might break your plugins. To fix them, navigate to the plug menu and click the cog in the top-right corner, then select \"Plugins\" and reinstall the ones that have updates. You might also need to update Decky Loader itself, in the General menu on the same page. And if you're not seeing the plug menu, you'll need to exit back out to desktop, reinstall Decky Loader using the install file you grabbed earlier, and restart.\n\nLet's close with an example, and an answer for how to get artwork for your Non-Steam games. In the Decky store, grab the SteamGridDB plugin. Now, with it installed, go to any of your installed Steam games and click the Start button (the three horizontal lines above the right thumbstick). From the menu that pops up, select Change Artwork. You'll see a number of community-made options that will change how the game's various icons and posters will show up across your Steam Deck. This will work with almost any game in your library—most have art uploaded to the database this plug-in pulls from—and some non-game programs, too. Most importantly, it will allow you to easily add art to games that don't have it by default, like Non-Steam games.\n\nThe Steam Deck might be a handheld, but that doesn't mean you can't use it like a regular desktop pc, too. I've already covered how to access desktop mode on the Steam Deck, but if you want to go the extra mile and use it on the big screen, you'll probably want a dock.\n\nYou've got a few options for this. I use the unofficial JSAUX dock, mostly because I bought mine before the official Steam Deck dock came out. For firmware support from Valve, you're going to want the more expensive official Steam Deck dock, but this will merely increase stability—it's not required.\n\nWhatever you pick, you'll just want to ensure it has either a DisplayPort or HDMI 2.1 connection (ensure your TV or monitor supports these, too), since those will support high resolutions and fast refresh rates. A built-in ethernet port is also nice, so you can have a wired internet connection, as are extra USB ports.\n\nWith a dock, you'll be able to connect your Steam Deck to a big screen using the USB-C port at the top and the appropriate HDMI or DisplayPort cables for your dock. You'll also be able to connect as many accessories as your dock will allow. And some docks come with handy bonuses. For instance, storage company Sabrent sells a Steam Deck dock with room for an M.2 SSD, for expanded external storage. JSAUX sells one too, although I can't speak to it, since it's not the model I have.\n\nOnce you have your dock and it's all set up, just turn on your Steam Deck and set your TV or monitor to the right input, and you should able to play on the big screen, just like with a standard PC. Note that, depending on your screen's resolution, you might want to take advantage of manually setting per-game screen resolutions (available in the cog menu after selecting any game, under General > Game Resolution), as some games might need to be set to a lower resolution to run at full speed if connected to a 4K TV. Or, you could set a global max resolution for games by pressing the Steam button and navigating to Settings > Display > Advanced > Maximum Game Resolution.\n\nYou can also take advantage of the Steam Deck's built-in FSR upscaling to help make games look better when running at lower resolutions, by pressing the quick settings button, selecting the lightning bolt icon (this will take you to the Steam Deck's performance settings), and scrolling down to Scaling Filter. Select Sharp to start upscaling the way I usually do, but there are other filters and modes for you to play with to find the right settings for you, too.\n\nAside from playing PC games, you can also use the Steam Deck to emulate games from older systems, too. While you could install emulators yourself (programs that are legal, as long as they don't come with copyrighted software), industrious fans have created a tool to make installing all the emulators you could possibly need on your Steam Deck way simpler.\n\nIt's called Emudeck, and installing it as as simple as going to desktop mode, opening a browser to emudeck.com, clicking the Download button in the top-right corner, selecting steamOS, and running the install file from either your browser or the Downloads tab in the File Manager.\n\nHonestly, there are a lot of install options you can select here—too many to list. If you're new to emulation, I suggest selecting Easy Mode, which will get you set up with EmuDeck's recommended settings. These should work for most people, but if you want to customize things like aspect ratios, filters, and which emulators you install, choose Custom Mode.\n\nGo through the install process, and then to find your emulators, either open Emulation Station (or the alternative frontend you installed using Custom Mode) in gaming mode under Library > Non-Steam Games, or Steam ROM Manager by opening it in the \"Start\" menu.\n\nAs for actually getting games onto your device, you're generally on your own there: It relies on your collection of retro games and methods for getting files from it. However, many of the same steps outlined in this article will apply.\n\nIf your Steam Deck's fan is too loud, you don't have to just accept it. You've actually got multiple steps to control it, including one easy official toggle and one more advanced fan-made option.\n\nLet's start with the official toggle. If your fan is too loud, press the Steam button on your device, then select System and scroll all the way down until you see Enable updated fan control. Toggle that on to make your fan quieter, but note that doing so could reduce performance, as your system won't handle heat as well (if this is already toggled, you can actually toggle it off to gain a potential performance boost).\n\nFor more detailed control, install Decky Loader using the \"Install plugins\" hack on this list. Then, install the Fantastic plugin. This will allow you to set a custom fan curve for your Steam Deck, which will change the fan speed based on your Steam Deck's current temperature. Simply open the plug-in and tap on the curve under the FAN menu to adjust it to your liking.\n\nNot every game needs your Steam Deck's full power. If you're playing a more lightweight title, considering lowering your Steam Deck's performance to save some battery life. \n\nTo do this, press the quick settings button and select the lighting bolt icon to access the performance menu. From here, you can adjust the TDP Limit to lower how much power your Steam Deck is allowed to use. By default, it's set to 15 Watts, but on some lightweight games, I've been able to get away with 8 watts or less. Play around to find the right power-to-performance balance for you, depending on your game.\n\nWhile you're here, you can also set a Manual GPU Clock, which will lower your GPU's performance, and could also help you gain more battery life. Similarly, you can set your screen's refresh rate, which will reduce how many frame your system will be able to display per second, but could similarly extend your playtime.\n\nEver since Valve discontinued the Steam Deck LCD, the base price for the Steam Deck has been $550. Not bad for an OLED screen and all this device can do, but much more expensive than the former $400 starting price. \n\nHowever, Valve will sometimes drop new batches of \"certified refurbished\" Steam Decks on its store page. These can go for as low as $279, and while these drops are rare, it's a hefty discount if you can find it.\n\nValve is your best bet to get a refurbished Steam Deck without any issues, but if you absolutely need one and can't wait for the next drop, you can try a third-party program. GameStop also sells its own refurbished Steam Decks, although at time of writing, stock is also low there.\n\nRefurbished Steam Decks are probably worth keeping an eye out for, but don't plan on getting one if you really want a Steam Deck now.\n\nValve is constantly iterating SteamOS, but it can take a while for new features to reach the general public. If you can't wait to get the next big SteamOS update, though, you can easily To do so, press the Steam button, then navigate to Settings > System > Beta Participation. From here, join either the Beta or Preview update channels.\n\nThese will let you get new SteamOS features more quickly, although they can introduce instability. Still, if you're fine with tinkering, this will let you get your hands on features like display-off downloads more quickly.\n\nFinally, let's make that screen look a little more vibrant. This can be especially helpful if you're like me, and you have one of those discontinued LCD Steam Decks.\n\nThis used to be limited to a fan-made plugin, but Valve has now added official support for adjusting your Steam Deck's color settings. To access this, press the Steam button, and navigate to Settings > Display. From here, click Adjust Display Colors. You'll be taken to a menu where you can adjust the device's color temperature and vibrance, and see the results on a demo image right up top.",

    "title": "OpenAI Is Killing ChatGPT-4o (Again)",
    "description": "The fan favorite model had previously been called \"sycophantic\" by critics.",
    "fullText": "https://enterprise.shutterstock.com/image-photo/openai-logo-displayed-on-smartphone-screen-2520388517\n\nor\n\nhttps://enterprise.shutterstock.com/image-photo/chatgpt-logo-displayed-on-smartphone-screen-2520385879\n\nLast August, ChatGPT developers OpenAI unceremoniously killed the fan favorite GPT-4o model, before giving in to complaints and bringing it back a week later. Now, the company's taking a second swing at getting its users to move on. In a new post to its website, OpenAI announced that it's retiring GPT-4o again.\n\nThe model's set to disappear from ChatGPT's model picker on Feb. 13, alongside other older models like GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-Mini. And OpenAI is clearly nervous about the decision.\n\n\"While the announcement applies to several older models,\" OpenAI wrote, \"GPT-4o deserves special context.\"\n\nAccording to the company, it has taken user outcry over the initial deprecation of 4o to heart while developing its newest models, GPT-5.1 and GPT-5.2, and has built these models with the idea of maintaining the features fans liked best about the old model. The company says that now \"only 0.1% of users\" opt for GPT-4o on a daily basis.\n\nAs such, the company wants to focus on \"improving the models most people use today,\" which apparently means removing older ones. \"We know that losing access to GPT-4o will feel frustrating for some users, and we didn't make this decision lightly,\" the post reads.\n\nSo, what's with OpenAI treating its users so gingerly, especially when GPT-4o is a few generations behind, and there are newer models that supposedly do everything it does, but better?\n\nWell, when GPT-4o was first deprecated, people weren't happy. Users called its successor, GPT-5, \"an unmitigated disaster,\" and accused OpenAI of pulling \"the biggest bait-and-switch in AI history.\"\n\nSome criticized the model's usefulness, saying it got answers wrong and broke code, but what maybe stuck out the most was people calling out its more concise tone.\n\nGPT-4o has been called \"sycophantic\" by critics, something the company addressed and said it wanted to pull back on in future updates. But I guess one person's \"yes man\" is another person's \"active listener.\" When the company initially pulled GPT-4o, users complained that its replacement was cold and felt less like a \"friend.\" Even OpenAI acknowledged this, saying in today's post that users \"preferred GPT-4o's conversational style and warmth.\"\n\nIn short, in the words of 4o-supporters themselves, they were \"grieving\" the model.\n\nThat said, with so many users now seeming to have moved on from 4o, OpenAI's decision does seem understandable on the surface. Personally, one of the things that drives me away from AI is how much reassuring filler text seems to fluff up most answers (\"you're absolutely right\" and such), seemingly just to make me feel good about myself. More concise, to-the-point responses would be a little less off-putting for me.\n\nTo try to split the difference, OpenAI reworked its Personalization feature in GPT-5.1, so users can simply choose how the chatbot will treat them. There are options for more professional responses, more nerdy ones, more efficient ones, and for those who want that active listener style, more friendly ones.\n\nGoing by OpenAI's numbers, that seems to have been enough for most people, but there are still some calling foul at the company's new announcement.\n\nIn a Reddit thread responding to OpenAI's new posts, users doubted that the 0.1% number for 4o was accurate, saying that prompts have been \"rerouting to 5.2 no matter what\" and that \"something somewhere in their calculations doesn't add up.\" Others pointed out that free users can't use GPT-4o and that it's not enabled by default, which will naturally juice the numbers against it.\n\nAs such, calls to cancel ChatGPT subscriptions are once again circulating amongst 4o's more dedicated fans. In a popular thread on the OpenAI subreddit, one user called 4o \"OpenAI's most advanced and beloved model,\" and praised its \"personality, warmth, and consistency,\" saying that its fans have built long-term project and \"emotional support routines\" around it, and that suddenly losing it without even the option for a legacy mode \"feels abrupt and deeply disappointing.\"\n\n\"This isn't about resisting innovation,\" the post writes. \"It's about respecting bonds users have formed with specific models.\"\n\nWhether the fan outcry will work again remains to be seen. However, as ChatGPT chief Nick Turley has previously looked at those kinds of bonds with skepticism, and because keeping old models in operating condition probably takes developer resources away from making new ones, I wouldn't count on it.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Safari User Should Know",
    "description": "How to supercharge the most efficient browser on the Mac.",
    "fullText": "If you're the kind of person who only uses Safari to download Chrome, you need to think again. For a Mac user, Safari might be the best browser there is (yes, even better than Chrome). It's fast, secure, doesn't buckle under most loads, sips RAM instead of munching through it, and it'll help your battery last longer as well. And yes, there are even extensions and ad blockers that work natively in Safari.\n\nIt's time to take another look at Safari, and use all its hidden features and smarts to make your browsing better.\n\nWhen this feature came out, it became a bit of a meme on TikTok. In case you haven't heard, Safari has a new Hide Distracting Items feature that can zap pretty much anything on a webpage out of existence. You'll find in the page options menu (the - icon to the left of the address bar). After activating it, try clicking on a popup menu, autoplaying video, newsletter box or pretty much anything else. It'll be banished from your screen, and there will even be a little animation showing it disappearing like it's just been snapped by Thanos. And Safari will remember your snap, so it won't show up the next time you visit that site on your Mac, or even your iPhone or iPad. And if you're feeling more like Iron Man, yes, you can cancel your snaps.\n\nFor ad blocking, Firefox and Chrome have the uBlock Origin extension. Then there are browsers like Brave and Opera, which come with ad-blocking built-in. Safari has always suffered in this regard. There was never really a true alternative to uBlock available for Safari. There is a version of uBlock Origin for Safari, but it doesn't use Safari's own framework for ad-blocking, so it suffers when it comes to performance and blocking capabilities.\n\nBut now it seems like there's finally a decent alternative, called wBlock. I've been using it ever since my colleague, Justin Pot, wrote about it, and I am happy to say that it finally makes Safari's ad-blocking experience on par with some of the bigger browsers. And the best part? wBlock is free and open-source.\n\nBefore development was suspended, I loved the Arc browser. But ever since the company shut it down, I have become jaded, and I haven't really started using alternatives like the Zen Browser. The biggest features I miss from Arc are the workspaces and vertical tabs. But now, Safari has those too. In Safari, you can now create Tab Groups, which can contain as many tabs as you want. I use these as my workspaces. One group for reading long articles, another for travel research, and so on.\n\nAnd while I'm in a tab group, I also like to do it with the sidebar open (click the Sidebar button next to the Back and Forward buttons), which gives me a vertical-tabs experience similar to Arc's. It isn't exactly like Arc, because the horizontal tab bar up top doesn't disappear. But having a vertical list of tabs still helps. So does the fact that Tab Groups sync with my iPhone and iPad, so I can pick up my research there as well.\n\nTo create a new tab group, click the New Tab Group button at the top of the sidebar. Or you can select multiple tabs, right-click, and choose the Move to Tab Group > New Tab Group option. On the iPhone, open the tab switcher, tap the Menu button from the top, and choose New Empty Tab Group to get started.\n\nSafari was one of the few apps that saw a major design update in iOS 26, with a redesigned bottom bar. Lifehacker has a detailed guide on all the new hidden gestures and features in Safari's iOS 26 redesign, but I'll highlight some of my favorites here.\n\nSwipe to switch tabs: To quickly switch between tabs, just swipe left or right on the address bar.\n\nPress and hold the address bar: A lot is hidden here. You can copy a link, paste from your clipboard, switch to another tab group, close tabs, or close all tabs.\n\nSwipe up on the address bar: Swipe up on the address bar to reveal all open tabs. From here, you can swipe left or right to switch between tab groups. From the top menu, you can copy links for all open tabs with ease.\n\nPin tabs: Tap and hold a website from the tabs screen, and choose the Pin Tab option to pin the website to the top of your browser.\n\nIf you don't like the iPhone's new compact tab bar or its gestures, you can still go back to the way things used to be. Go to Settings > Apps > Safari > Tabs. Switch to the Bottom option to bring back the expanded bottom toolbar, or to go further back in time, go with the Top option.\n\nIt's not as obvious as in Chrome, but Safari also has profiles that sync between iPhone, iPad, and Mac. You can use Profiles to keep your work and personal lives separate. This can also be useful if you and your spouse use the same Mac.\n\nProfiles will fully separate your browsing from other users, including logins, cookies, browsing history, tab groups, favorites, and even extensions.\n\nTo set one up for Safari on Mac, go to Settings > Profiles. On the iPhone, go to Settings > Apps > Safari > Profiles and tap New Profile. Give it a name, and make sure to pick an icon and color. This will tint the background of the start page, so it'll find it easier to know which profile you're in.\n\nOn Mac, you can use Safari to turn any frequently used website into an app of its own. It will show up in the Dock and the app-switcher. It's still the same website, but it will have its own shortcut on your Mac's interface, making it easier to use. If you use your Mac for retail, or any kind of specialized work that happens via a website, this can be really handy.\n\nTo do this, visit a website, click the Share button, and click Add to Dock. Your logins will sync automatically, and so will your extensions. The toolbar will be colored based on the website colors as well.\n\nYou can also do this on iPhone, by navigating to a site, tapping the Share button, tapping More, and tapping Add to Home Screen. The website's logo will show up as an \"app\" on your home screen, and it'll act as a shortcut to the site.\n\nI love opening tabs, but I hate closing them. That means it's easy for me to hit the 500 tab limit in Safari. So I enabled the option that automatically closes tabs that are older than 30 days. You can do this by going to Settings > Apps > Safari > Close Tabs. You can choose between one day, one week, or one month.\n\nYou might be familiar with Safari's Reader Mode, which is perhaps the best in the business. But there's another feature hidden in the Page Settings option. Tap the Listen to Page button, and Safari will instantly start reading the site you're on out loud. Before doing this, though, I would recommend you switch to Reader Mode first, so the text-to-speech doesn't get caught on ads or other distractions.\n\nEvery time you open Safari, or a new tab, you see the browser's default start page. Let's take some time to customize just how it looks and works. First, open the start page, then click the Edit button in the bottom-right corner to enable or disable which sections you want to see. I suggest adding sections for your Favorites, Reading List, iCloud Tabs, and Recently Closed Tabs. You can also change the background to any color that you like.\n\nIf you don't like an overloaded start page, you can also try out the Bonjourr Safari extension. It's a start-page replacement that I've used for months now. It automatically cycles between serene backgrounds while showing the time and weather. You can add quick shortcuts for your frequently visited sites, too. It's also fully customizable, and looks great on iPhone as well as Mac.",

    "fullText": "Outside opinions mean little to Donegal manager Jim McGuinness and his single-minded approach will continue into Sunday's All-Ireland final rematch against Kerry in Ballyshannon [13:30 GMT].\n\nThe Kingdom romped to a 39th Sam Maguire success last summer, defeating Donegal 1-26 to 0-19 in the final as Jack O'Connor's side exploded into life on their run to the title.\n\nSome queried Donegal's zonal approach in that game but McGuinness insists \"we'll decide what's right and won't be listening to anybody else\" in terms of his team's tactical approach.\n\n\"There's loads of opinions out there and loads of people saying loads of things but that doesn't have any impact on my thinking whatsoever - I don't listen to those people,\" he said following Saturday's opening win over Dublin.\n\n\"Most of them have never coached at inter-county level, most have never stood on a sideline, most have never won anything as a coach.

I think he knew he could play, but he wouldn't go around and tell people that. He was just a wonderful guy.\"\n\nGary Birtles, who spent 10 years at Forest, said he was an absolute genius and a \"striker's delight\".\n\n\"He was funny, loved his music and his jokes,\" added Birtles. \"He was a genuine top bloke and there was no edge to him.\n\n\"You ask any player who is the best player they played with at Forest and they would say John.\n\n\"We saw him suffer over the years but he still came out and carried on telling his jokes. It was great to be around him.\"\n\nBorn in the Viewpark area of North Lanarkshire, Robertson played for Drumchapel Amateurs and Scotland at youth level before joining Forest in May 1970, making his debut later that year.\n\nHaving been on the transfer list before Clough's arrival in 1975, he became a key player, appearing in 243 consecutive games between December 1976 and December 1980.\n\nRobertson scored the winner from the penalty spot in the 1978 League Cup final replay win over Liverpool.\n\nHe then scored the only goal as Nottingham Forest retained the European Cup by beating Hamburg in 1980, having delivered the cross from which Trevor Francis netted the winner the previous season against Malmö.\n\nHe was sold to Derby in 1983, a move which soured the relationship between Clough and his former assistant, Peter Taylor.\n\nAn early injury hampered Robertson's progress at the Rams and, despite rejoining Forest in 1985, he never again captured the same form and moved on to non-league Corby Town, Stamford and then Grantham Town.\n\nFor Scotland, he scored a winning goal against England in 1981 and netted against New Zealand at the 1982 World Cup.\n\nHe earned 28 caps for his country before going on to be assistant manager to former Forest team-mate Martin O'Neill with Wycombe Wanderers, Norwich City, Leicester City, Celtic and Aston Villa.\n\nIn 2015, Robertson topped a poll by the Nottingham Post newspaper of fans' all-time favourite Forest players.\n\nShortly after his death, Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis said the club would name a stand at the City Ground after Robertson as a \"lasting recognition of his extraordinary contribution to our club\".\n\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "description": "A slow-burning Australian Open looks set for a final weekend flourish after Novak Djokovic takes the limelight once again in Melbourne.",
    "fullText": "The Australian Open loves to market itself as the 'Happy Slam'. In truth, there has been some dissatisfaction that this year's edition has been far from classic.\n\nA lack of high-quality matches and dramatic moments have left many complaining the Melbourne event has been a bit of a dud.\n\nBut the entertainment dished up on day 13 has finally ignited the opening major of the season.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz's herculean effort to beat Alexander Zverev in Friday's first men's semi-final looked likely to be the headline act.\n\nThough Novak Djokovic, never the type to play support, had other ideas.\n\nThe irrepressible 38-year-old produced one of the most jaw-dropping results of his career - no mean feat given everything he has achieved - to topple Jannik Sinner in the second semi-final and steal the show.\n\n\"I watched Alcaraz v Zverev, what an incredible match. We tried to match that intensity,\" Djokovic, who kept his dream of a standalone record 25th Grand Slam title alive, told the Melbourne crowd.\n\n\"I think you guys got your value for money on the tickets, that's for sure. I want 10% from tonight's tickets sold!\"\n\nThe second week of the Australian Open had largely lacked jeopardy and excitement, with the top seeds rolling through the men's and women's singles in a series of straightforward wins.\n\nAlcaraz beating Zverev was only the fourth match from the last 16 onwards - across both draws - to go longer than straight sets.\n\nAnother quickly followed. Djokovic emerged victorious from a pulsating contest which left thousands of Serbian fans dancing around Melbourne Park in disbelief at 1:30am.\n\n\"I first watched Novak here when I was nine years old - this is the most amazing feeling I've had,\" said 27-year-old Sasha Stanisic, who was among the hundreds watching on a big screen outside Rod Laver Arena.\n\n\"For me, this is a close second among his greatest achievements - just behind his win in the 2019 Wimbledon final against Roger Federer. It's been a special night.\"\n\nDjokovic's implausible victory ended the possibility of another Grand Slam rendezvous between Alcaraz and Sinner, who most expected to meet for the fourth major final in a row.\n\nInstead it will be a third battle for one of the sport's biggest prizes between Djokovic and Alcaraz, after their Wimbledon finals in 2023 and 2024.\n\nBefore Sunday's showpiece, there is another appetising match-up when Aryna Sabalenka and Elena Rybakina contest the women's singles final on Saturday.\n\nTwo of the most powerful players on the WTA Tour going toe-to-toe promises to be a blockbuster encounter.\n\nGiven the superstars involved and engaging storylines, a slow-burning Australian Open looks set to finish with a flourish - a case of better late than never.\n\n\"This tournament hadn't really set on fire. So this special day with two epic matches is what we had been waiting for the whole fortnight,\" former British number one Annabel Croft said on BBC Radio 5 Live.",

I am pretty calm. We have shown what we are capable of as a team.\"\n\nJoshua Zirkzee remains at the centre of interest as it remains to be seen if he returns to Italy, with Juventus considering whether to make a move for the former Bologna forward who cost United £36.5m 18 months ago.\n\nZirkzee has recovered from a minor injury and is available for the Fulham game.\n\n\"Josh has just been trying to work to get fit,\" said Carrick. \"It was great to have him training with the group the first time and I am just looking forward to working with him.\"\n\nCarrick accepts the issue of Bruno Fernandes' future is \"on the agenda a little bit\", with the United captain due to assess his plans at the end of the season.\n\nHowever, Carrick said that situation would be dealt with \"further down the line\".",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Smartwatches, Oura rings, smart home devices and Fitbits being weaponised, says Refuge\n\nDomestic abusers are increasingly using AI, smartwatches and other technology to attack and control their victims, a domestic abuse charity says.\n\nRecord numbers of women who were abused and controlled through technology were referred to Refuge’s specialist services during the last three months of 2025, including a 62% increase in the most complex cases to total 829 women. There was also a 24% increase in referrals of under-30s.\n\nRecent cases included perpetrators using wearable tech such as smartwatches, Oura rings and Fitbits to track and stalk women, disrupting their lives through smart home devices that control lights and heating, and using AI spoofing apps to impersonate people.\n\nEmma Pickering, head of the tech-facilitated abuse team at Refuge, said: “Time and again, we see what happens when devices go to market without proper consideration of how they might be used to harm women and girls. It is currently far too easy for perpetrators to access and weaponise smart accessories, and our frontline teams are seeing the devastating consequences of this abuse.\n\n“It is unacceptable for the safety and wellbeing of women and girls to be treated as an afterthought once a technology has been developed and distributed. Their safety must be a foundational principle shaping both the design of wearable technology and the regulatory frameworks that surround it.”\n\nRefuge said it was far too easy to access and weaponise smart accessories and that women’s safety needed to be factored into their design.\n\nOne survivor Refuge worked with, Mina, left behind her smartwatch in a rush to flee her abuser, who then used it to track her by using linked cloud accounts to locate her emergency accommodation.\n\n“[It] was deeply shocking and frightening. I felt suddenly exposed and unsafe, knowing that my location was being tracked without my consent. It created a constant sense of paranoia; I couldn’t relax, sleep properly, or feel settled anywhere because I knew my movements weren’t private,” she said.\n\nDespite police returning the device to Mina, she was located at her next refuge by a private investigator hired by her abuser, using suspected tracking via technology. She reported the breaches to police but was told no crime had been committed because she had “not come to any harm”.\n\n“I was repeatedly asked to move for my safety, rather than the technology being dealt with directly or the smart watch being confiscated from him. Each move made me feel more unstable and displaced,” she said.\n\n“Overall, the experience left me feeling unsafe, unheard, and responsible for managing a situation that was completely out of my control. It showed me how tech abuse can quietly and powerfully extend coercive control, and how easily survivors can be left to carry the emotional and practical burden when systems don’t fully understand or respond to it.”\n\nAbusers were also increasingly using AI tools to manipulate survivors, Pickering said. For example, they might alter a video of the survivor so that she appeared drunk, enabling them to tell social services that “she’s acting erratic again, slurring speech, she’s got a drink problem” and that she was therefore an unfit mother or a risk to herself and others. “We’ll see more and more of that as these videos and applications advance,” Pickering said.\n\nPickering said she had also heard of AI tools being used to develop authentic-looking fraudulent documents, for example job offers or legal summons, which can be sent to survivors to make them believe they are in debt, or to persuade them to turn up to the same location as their abuser.\n\nPickering feared that in coming years, medical tech would increasingly be misused, for example by controlling insulin levels through a diabetes tracker, which can be fatal.\n\nShe urged the government to act on digital technology-enabled and online crimes, including providing more funding to develop and train digital investigations teams. “They want short-term wins, they don’t want to think about longer-term investment in this area, but if we don’t do that we’ll never get ahead,” she said.\n\nShe also wants to see the technology industry held to account for failing to ensure devices and platforms are designed and function in ways that are safe for vulnerable people.\n\n“Ofcom and the Online Safety Act don’t go far enough,” she said.\n\nA government spokesperson said: “Tackling violence against women and girls in all its forms, including when it takes place online or is facilitated by technology, is a top priority for this government.\n\n“Our new VAWG strategy sets out how the full power of the state will be deployed online and offline. We are working with Ofcom to set out how online platforms tackle the disproportionate abuse women and girls face online.”",

    "fullText": "“They laughed at me and told me this wouldn’t have happened if I was a ‘normal’ human being,” Aliya Rahman tells The Nation.\n\nOver the past two weeks, images of Aliya Rahman, a US citizen, being dragged out of her car by ICE agents as she screamed “I am disabled” have swept across social media. Rahman, a 42-year-old Minneapolis resident, was on her way to a doctor’s appointment at the city’s Traumatic Brain Injury Center on January 15, when masked agents smashed in one of her car windows, opened the driver’s side door, slashed her seat belt, yanked her out of the car, and forcibly took her away. In the seconds before they did so, visuals showed the agents yelling “Move!” at Rahman.\n\nSpeaking to The Nation on Tuesday, Rahman recalled the confusion she felt at that moment.\n\n“As an autistic person, it was particularly difficult to understand what the officers wanted me to do,” Rahman said. “I personally experience audio sorting challenges as an autistic person. This makes it so that voices near and far are prioritized in the same way, making it difficult for me to figure out who is talking to me. Because of this, I tend to rely on reading lips. You can imagine how difficult it was for me to try to read lips when ICE officers are completely masked.”\n\nIn the videos, Rahman can be heard pleading with the officers to let her go, constantly reminding them, “I am an autistic disabled person, I am trying to go to the doctor.”\n\nBut Rahman emphasized that, her disability notwithstanding, this would not have been an easy moment to navigate for anyone. “I think it’s also important to point out that even someone who is not autistic would have trouble handling that situation. It was chaotic and overwhelming. There was a lot going on and it was happening fast.”\n\nThe incident occurred just blocks away from where, a week earlier, an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good. “I constantly wondered if I was going to die,” Rahman said.\n\nAfter the officers handcuffed her, they lifted her from her hands and her feet and carried her away.\n\n“I do remember facing the ground and feeling pressure on my neck, which, because of my brain injury, was extremely painful for me,” she said.\n\nThe viral video ends with Rahman being dragged out and carried away by several officers. What transpired after that wasn’t captured on camera, but Rahman recalled how quickly things unraveled.\n\n“After I was violently dragged from my car, I was put in the back of a car with three federal agents, where they laughed at me and told me this wouldn’t have happened if I was a ‘normal’ human being,” Rahman said.\n\nRahman was then taken to the Whipple Federal Building, where many people are detained after being swept up by ICE agents. Throughout her detention, Rahman kept reminding the officers that she is autistic and disabled, but no one seemed to care.\n\n“I was repeatedly denied medical care, disability accommodations, and access to a mobility aid when I asked for my cane. Eventually, I insisted that they look for a wheelchair. When they found one and I was placed in it, I was told that my legs must work if I had been driving,” Rahman recalled. No one asked for her ID or proof of citizenship after she was detained, Rahman said, nor was her face scanned.\n\nRahman eventually fell unconscious, and so does not know what happened next. She knows she was moved to the Hennepin County Medical Center and eventually let go that day.\n\nRahman is being represented by the MacArthur Justice Center. Her lawyer, Alexa Van Brunt, said that she is “currently gathering evidence in order to pursue legal remedies for the gross violation of Aliya’s rights that day.”\n\nThe Trump administration’s immigration crackdown over the last year has led to over two dozen violent or fatal arrests by ICE, as per a report by Documented.\n\nBrunt said ICE agents “have certainly acted as if they are above the law.”\n\n“In Aliya’s case, they also violated every law enforcement standard and protocol governing use of force and the treatment of people with disabilities,” Brunt said. “Rather than using clear communication, they issued conflicting and confusing commands. Rather than de-escalating the scene, they swore at Aliya and broke her car window. And after finding out Aliya had a disability and traumatic brain injury, they increased their use of violence, slamming her into the ground, carrying her like an animal, and continuously denying her medical care.”",

    "description": "New rules, a different engine partner, and new technical leadership with a penchant for pushing the envelope made Aston Martin a late arrival in Barcelona",
    "fullText": "Like Indiana Jones snatching his misplaced fedora from under a rapidly descending stone doorway, Aston Martin’s timing was dramatically close to the edge this week. The team arrived for the Barcelona ‘shakedown week’ late on the third of the five days and only achieved a handful of laps when its AMR26 emerged from the garage on the afternoon of the fourth.\n\nAston Martin had admitted – albeit quietly and grudgingly – that it was likely to be late and therefore miss at least one of its three permitted days of running. But in truth, this was always going to be on the cards given the involvement of talismanic engineer Adrian Newey, a creative and competitive force to be reckoned with – and a man with a history of pushing development as long as possible so as to arrive with a more mature and competitive package than his rivals.\n\nThe AMR26 has come together over the past few months against a tapestry of further upheavals behind the scenes, as team principal Andy Cowell was moved sideways into an engine-liaison role and Newey added some of his duties to his own portfolio. And along with the challenges of finding innovative solutions to the challenges faced by the all-new technical regulations for 2026, Aston Martin also had to integrate with a new engine partner, Honda.\n\nThis also entailed building its own gearbox after years of buying in the Mercedes powertrain as a package, which also dictated the mounting points of the rear suspension.\n\n\"We obviously are in a bit of a unique situation,\" said chief trackside engineer Mike Krack after the AMR26 ran for the first time on Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"We welcome Honda, our new engine partner, our new power unit partner. We have made our first gearbox in very many, many years, and you pair that with new chassis regulations, new power unit regulations – so basically you could say it's the worst case or the best case, but it's a huge change for us as a team, to be a works team, a factory team, together with these regulations.\n\n\"Then we have Adrian on board, so it's all very exciting and a lot of change, and then Formula 1 is not waiting for you, so you have to be ready. We were a little bit late, but we made it to this test, so I think we can be proud and happy of that achievement.\"\n\nThe AMR26 features a number of distinctive solutions that bear the fingerprints not just of Newey but also chief technical officer Enrico Cardile, who joined Aston Martin from Ferrari last year. The triangular airbox arrangement with ‘Viking horns’ mounted alongside bears some familial resemblance with the first two ground-effect Ferraris raced under Cardile’s aegis; but readers with longer memories will recall Newey employing a similar arrangement on the 2005 McLaren MP4-20.\n\nHonda’s contribution will be interesting since this is in effect an all-new project. The company has a long-standing culture of incubating in-house talent by picking the brightest and best engineering graduates and essentially throwing them in at the deep end. Those responsible for bringing its most recent hybrid power unit to a successful state with Red Bull have been dispersed within the company, partly a consequence of Honda quitting Formula 1 in 2021 and then reversing that decision 18 months later.\n\n\"When you have such a long relationship with the previous partner, you need to know the [new] people, you need to learn the names, how you work with each other, what are your expectations, what are the responsibilities, and all these kind of things,\" said Krack.\n\n\"But it was a good start, a few smiles between ourselves and them, and it's our goal, obviously, to use this time now to integrate as much as we can, to learn how to work together.\n\n\"But I'm very confident. They [Honda] are racers, they are very open, you can challenge them, it's really nice, and I'm looking forward to continuing the relationship.\"\n\nAston Martin's 2026 F1 car is finally on track, causes red flag\n\nAston Martin to lose one F1 test day, intends to run in Barcelona on Thursday\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "Martin Brundle has shared his first impressions of Adrian Newey's debut Aston Martin design during Barcelona private testing",
    "fullText": "Former Formula 1 driver and Sky Sports analyst Martin Brundle has discussed the first Adrian Newey-designed Aston Martin as it took to the track during private testing in Barcelona.\n\nNewey joined the Silverstone outfit as managing technical partner in 2025 and will now serve as team principal in 2026, meaning the AMR26 is the first Newey-designed Aston Martin under his complete management.\n\n\"Adrian, his cars tend to be quite homogeneous in their beautiful, sweeping airflow to them, you often see that. There doesn’t appear to be as many bits hanging off his cars as you do see on some others,\" Brundle told Sky Sports F1.\n\n\"It’s a really hard undercut on the sidepod, and we’ve seen different interpretations on sidepods, front wings across the board, unsurprisingly, with such new regulations.\"\n\nThe 2026 season brings in a new set of regulations to the championship. Newey was tasked with interpreting the new ruleset while also adjusting to a new team and reuniting with Honda, having previously worked with the manufacturer at Red Bull. Brundle raised questions about whether the designer has the right people around him and also pointed to potential delays in Honda's power unit project.\n\n\"We’ve got to assume Adrian has come up with some good ideas, but does he know enough about the Aston Martin wind tunnel and the digital wind tunnel and will he get correlation? Has he got the right people around him to interpret his brilliance?\" the former driver added.\n\n\"That’s a tall order straight out of the box, actually. Adrian was saying to me that Honda are having to play catch-up because they were leaving and then they came back in. So there’s some question marks there.\n\n\"We’ll have to wait and see, but you just know Adrian will have a vision of how to maximise these regulations. Let’s hope he’s done it and let’s hope that car just flies.\n\n\"He’s also legendary for not wanting to sign things off, so when the car was late, it didn’t surprise me at all, to be honest, because Adrian will push that, and he always has done, to the absolute limit because he wants the maximum time of development on those pieces and understanding.\n\n\"He doesn’t have that control function of a Christian Horner, or a Patrick Head, or whatever these days. He’s in charge of all of that, but if it absolutely takes off, then as ever, you can say he got it absolutely right. He’s waited until the last minute before having to commit.\n\n\"We’ll see - we don’t know - but I’m going to assume that car will be pretty handy through the year.\"\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "The Scout's verdict is in ahead of Gameweek 24 in Fantasy Premier League as City visit Spurs.\n\nPep Guardiola’s side visit the capital on Sunday 1 February, with kick-off scheduled for 16:30 (UK).\n\nThe Blues lock horns with Thomas Frank’s side with the view of recording a third win in succession in all competitions.\n\nBut we face a Spurs side who beat Frankfurt 2-0 in the Champions League in their previous assignment, meaning we’ll need to be at our best to collect three points this weekend.\n\nAll roads lead to an enthralling clash in north London and FPL managers will have an eye on proceedings at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nRead the latest Scout report below ahead of Saturday 31 January’s 13:30 (UK) deadline.\n\nRayan Cherki (£6.7m) looks a great option for Fantasy Premier League (FPL) managers ahead of Gameweek 24 (GW24).\n\nThe Frenchman has created 33 chances this season, of which 14 have been big chances, meaning 42.54% of his chances have been big ones. This is team leading at City.\n\nHe has also created a chance, on average, every 30 minutes in the league this season, which is the most of all the regular starters at the Blues.\n\nCherki’s 45 crosses, can only be bettered by Phil Foden (£8.5m) across the City team and his 64 successful passes into the penalty box is ten more than the next most in Guardiola’s squad.\n\nChristian Romero (£5.0m) is Spurs’ form player. The defender has scored six goals this season including three goals in the last three matches in all competitions.\n\nElsewhere, Morgan Gibbs-White (£7.3m) and Matty Cash (£4.8m) are low-owned gems who can return points in Gameweek 24.\n\nGibbs-White has returned two goals, one assist, three bonus points and two clean sheet points in the last four matches.\n\nCash has registered an assist and two clean sheets in the last four gameweeks. This season he has created 19 chances, only eight defenders can better that.\n\nThere’s no membership needed to get up to four tickets per person for our FA Cup fourth round clash with neighbours Salford City*.\n\nPriced from £17.50 for adults and £7.50 for children, it’s a fun day out for all the family on Saturday 14 February.\n\nHospitality for this game starts from just £60 with a wide range of options to suit every budget!\n\n*Tickets are on sale to all fans who have purchased at least one home fixture.

    "fullText": "Juventus director Giorgio Chiellini says the Bianconeri have ‘great respect’ for their Champions League play-off opponent Galatasaray, but insists the Serie A giants were ‘never’ close to signing Osimhen.\n\nJuventus have been drawn against Turkish giants Galatasaray in the Champions League knockout play-off.\n\nIt will be a reunion between Luciano Spalletti and Osimhen, who won the Serie A title at Napoli in 2022-23.\n\n“It’s a strong team with great players. We’ll play the second leg at home, so it won’t end in Istanbul, but we’ll have to be good at going to that stadium to play our game and exploit their weaknesses and limit the big potential and individual players, not just in attack,” Chiellini told Sky Sport Italia from Nyon after the draw.\n\nLEWISBURG, WEST VIRGINIA – JUNE 14: Former Juventus and Italian national team defender Giorgio Chiellini arrives at the airport prior to the official FIFA Club World Cup 2025 on June 14, 2025 in Lewisburg, West Virginia. (Photo by Michael Owens/Getty Images)\n\n“We all know Osimhen, but they are strong in other departments too.”\n\nJuventus have yet to sign a new player in the January window, and Chiellini said that there are no developments for now: “There is no news for now; three days are missing, and you’ll have updates in the coming days.”\n\nBack in 2013, Chiellini was on the pitch and Antonio Conte on the bench when Juventus lost a group stage game against Galatasaray, facing elimination from the Champions League group phase.\n\nIt had been postponed by one day due to heavy snow in Istanbul, but when it was played, the pitch’s condition was far from ideal\n\n“We lost it on the pitch, and I even made the decisive mistake, regardless of the snow and the pitch,” Chiellini said.\n\n“Now we are two different teams. We must respect their quality, because they have quality players in all departments, but we must also be aware of our skills and put in an important performance. It will go down to details, like every knockout game, we’ll have to be mature to play in Istanbul and confirm it the following week.”\n\nA reporter asked Chiellini if he would have liked to play up against Osimhen on the field.\n\n“Right now, I couldn’t cope,” he replied, smiling.\n\nISTANBUL, TURKEY – SEPTEMBER 21: Victor Osimhen of Galatasaray looks on during the Turkish Super big match between Fenerbahce and Galatasaray at Ulker Stadium on September 21, 2024 in Istanbul, Turkey. (Photo by Ahmad Mora/Getty Images)\n\n“But I would love to mark him for 45 minutes. I was unlucky to face him once late in my career when my physical qualities were limited, and I had to rely more on the mental aspect. He’s a strong player, he attacks the space and has natural hunger within that you don’t see in many players.\n\n“Galatasaray have many important players, some of whom have played in Serie A too. Turkish teams are making investments, and there’s great respect for a storied club like Galatasaray. It’s a fascinating challenge, it will be a tough game, but also an important test for us. We still have all to play for in Serie A, Champions League and Coppa Italia. We have some interesting weeks ahead.”\n\nHave Juventus ever been close to signing Osimhen before he moved to Galatasaray from Napoli?\n\n“If you mean that a club likes Osimhen, I think it’s true for all the teams, especially in Italy,” Chiellini concluded.\n\n“But realistically, there’s never been anything more than this.”",

    "fullText": "Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk has admitted his side are struggling to find any consistency in the league this season.\n\nThe Reds are sixth in the table and have lost seven of their 23 league games.\n\nSpeaking after their 6-0 Champions League win over Qarabag, van Dijk said: “I think I said it, in the Premier League, the problem and difficulties that we’re having at the moment is that we don’t have the consistency.\n\n“We can’t, so far, build enough good performances this season. And that’s something we’re working at, it’s something we have to improve.\n\n“We know we can do it, but like I said, not on a consistent basis. That’s why we have been struggling.”\n\nLiverpool’s win over Qarabag featured substitute appearances from teenage trio Rio Ngumoha, Amara Nallo, and Trey Nyoni.\n\nAnd the Dutchman has also warned that the level of scrutiny faced by players could become even harsher for the “next generation” of footballers.\n\nHe said: “I know what comes if you don’t perform. If I don’t have a good moment or a good game, that’s just part and parcel of football. But I’m a human being, and all the players before me have been through it too.\n\n“I’ve mentioned this in previous interviews, I think it’s going to be even tougher for the next generation of footballers. I wish them luck, and I’ll try to prepare them a little by talking to them about it.\n\n“But going forward, it will be very difficult, because everything is so micro nowadays. Back in the day, you played, things happened, good or bad, and that was part of it. For the next generation, it will be very tricky, and I want to help in the best way I can by sharing my experiences.”\n\nLiverpool take on Newcastle on Saturday and will look to get back to winning ways after five league games without a win.",

    "title": "Arsenal, Mikel Arteta and the ‘fear of failure’ they are trying to banish",
    "description": "Arsenal players were encouraged to speak up about how they were feeling as Arteta looks to prevent a recent blip in their Premier League title race from snowballing",
    "fullText": "On the morning after Arsenal’s 3-2 defeat to Manchester United, Mikel Arteta realised his players needed one specific message. The Basque and team discussed the principle that “you can't lose something you haven’t won, so leave all that behind”.\n\nPlayers were also encouraged to speak up about how they were feeling. There had been a release.\n\nArteta and his staff are aware of a “fear of failure” discussion encircling his team, so he knew he had to make them look at it in a different way.\n\n“Let’s enjoy it,” Arteta said, as he spoke of how it can’t be like this week to week for four months. The message was a progression of his dressing-room speech immediately after United.\n\n“This is the journey you’re on if you’re going to win the title,” Arteta said. “It’s not always going to go your way.”\n\nIn other words, there will be setbacks, especially if a team is seeking to be champions for the first time. It’s rarely been smooth, despite the perception Manchester City have given.\n\nArteta is said to have pitched the speech at exactly the right tone, something that is more notable since there has been a tendency for such performances to send him further in the other direction; more intense.\n\nStepping back a bit, the Arsenal manager instead came to a realisation. He could see there was something deeper than a normal setback.\n\nThe speech did bring a shift in training, aided by a forgiving win over Kairat.\n\nWhether the message fully sinks in, however, is the next question.\n\nArsenal might go out at Leeds United pumped to make amends for Sunday only for Karl Darlow to make a big save early on or Pascal Struijk to clatter a forward. Then, all the same thoughts from Sunday might surge back.\n\nSaturday does have the feel of a hinge fixture, primarily because Arsenal have such a tough match at the same time that many insiders wonder whether “the biggest game is in their own heads”. They’d still be top if they lost, after all, but no one would even consider that. The talk would be loss of momentum, and belief.\n\nHence Arteta knowing he has to get his team playing with conviction again. Or even, the conviction they offer in every competition that isn’t the Premier League. That alone reflects the psychology around all this.\n\nIt’s also easier said than done, given the “pressure bubble” Arteta’s staff feel the team are in, one obviously expanded by fans and so much social media noise. That’s what long waits without a title do, especially as you get so close.\n\nHence Arteta’s will to try and stamp out that “fear of failure”.\n\nOne of his biggest challenges might be finding a solution, which is why Monday might have been be so important.\n\nOthers still feel it’s Arteta himself that could do with a chat, because of how emotionally he lives all this. Perhaps it’s where Josh Kroenke could offer counsel, from his experience of success with the ownership’s American franchises.\n\nOne complication with any solution, after all, is that it is Arteta’s own intensity that has fed this atmosphere. And while it should never be overlooked that the Basque’s energy was absolutely crucial in restoring Arsenal as a force - and this probably would not have happened without it - the wonder is now whether such an important strength may have to just be tempered to actually get over the line. Not a total reassessment, but a tweak.\n\nArteta’s coaching base, after all, is “trying to control every element of play”. This approach has taken Arsenal to the top, as they tend to win virtually every game on xG. Described as “a probabilities man”, Arteta believes that if you do that in 35 of 38 matches, you likely win the league.\n\nThat final gap to actual victory nevertheless fosters a sense of “trying to win a title by process” and whether he’s overlooking that final human edge required.\n\nA question has been asked over whether the team is now so overcoached it is no longer so geared for attackers to score.\n\nThat can be seen in recent player stats on individual goals and assists, but also in other tangible effects with players, and within games.\n\nIn the 0-0 against Nottingham Forest, for example, Arsenal mostly executed their gameplan and another day would likely have seen them convert an xG of 2.37 to win. Again, probabilities.\n\nBut that in itself arguably illustrated the difference between process and true end product necessary to win the title. People may be fed up with references to Sir Alex Ferguson’s United, but it was hard not to think of one recently resurfaced quote about chasing wins.\n\n“The risk is you shove people in the box, because other teams react... but the value in the risk, if you score in the last minute of injury time - the dressing room after was electric.”\n\nIn order to bring that risk, Arteta pushed for Eberechi Eze’s signing. Except, it was then noted the playmaker was suddenly out of the team much more after failing to track Matty Cash in the 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa.\n\nInsiders similarly talk of how decisions on shape and structure have recently taken precedence over creativity.\n\nAs a Pep Guardiola follower, too, there’s an argument Arteta suffers from the same issue the City coach did in the Champions League; that he becomes so fixated on a gameplan, meaning that there is then a vacuum if it falters.\n\nUnited showed this. At 0-0, Arteta’s plan was to stop transitions by stopping Bruno Fernandes getting on the ball. Arsenal duly had control, and it eventually produced - or perhaps processed - that first goal.\n\nIn the six minutes before Bryan Mbuemo’s strike, though, Arteta was getting increasingly frantic about player decisions and duels. Control gave way to a meeker conservatism, that manifested in the errors for the equaliser. After that, they just couldn’t get into the fight in the same way.\n\nSources say that dynamic has led to certain players becoming too conscious of defensive mistakes, an issue compounded by the feeling there is a “Premier League team” and “a cup team” and it takes a lot to change that. How close, for example, is Martin Odegaard to being dropped?\n\nIf Arteta does want to shake things up, that may happen this weekend. The Norwegian has been visibly struggling in duels, but Leeds are all about duels, which is where Mikel Merino may come in.\n\nKai Havertz is also viewed as transformative, just for how his pressing gets Arsenal playing much higher.\n\nThere is admittedly a fair question over whether the very “monotony” of so many midweek matches is having an effect, especially with that pressing. It’s also been a pattern of Arsenal’s recent seasons that there has been a December-January slump, and it was notable that 2023-24 brought the run to 89 points after a mid-season break. That just poses another reason for a mental reset.\n\nOn that, Arteta is a big tennis fan, and has previously spoken about a 2024 Roger Federer speech at Dartmouth.\n\nIn that, the tennis great spoke about how he actually lost 46 percent of all shots in his career. He just had to remind himself it was only ever one shot.\n\n“When you’re playing a point, it has to be the most important thing in the world, and it is. But when it’s behind you, it’s behind you. This mindset is really crucial because it frees you to fully commit to the next point, and the next point after that, with intensity, clarity and focus…\n\n“You want to become a master at overcoming hard moments.”\n\nArteta has perhaps realised that.\n\nArsenal are probably the best team in the country, and can win a lot this season. They just have to start playing like that again, rather than as a team that can lose a lot.",

Pitchers and catchers report in just over two weeks, and this is the final month of the year without baseball until possibly November.

He anchors a very talented Red Sox rotation.\n\nIt was a little surprising to see Webb on this list, let alone this high. He is a good pitcher who is durable and has good stuff, and if this were an NL-only top 10 list, he should be on it.\n\nThe best young pitcher in baseball, reigning NL Cy Young award winner, and the Pirates only hope to get back to the postseason this decade.\n\nThe two-time reigning AL Cy Young award winner will look to make it three straight in 2026, which also could be his last season with the Tigers.\n\n— Enjoy free coverage of the top news & trending stories on The Big Lead —\n\nNFL: Super Bowl LX odds: Opening line for Patriots, Seahawks revealed\n\nNBA: NBA Power Rankings, 30 teams ranked from worst to first\n\nNHL: NHL Power Rankings, 32 teams ranked from worst to first\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: NFL’s crazy preseason Super Bowl 60 graphic resurfaces\n\nWWE: WWE Power Rankings ahead of Royal Rumble\n\nVIRAL: Shaun White pulls off epic Central Park snowboarding stunt over Shane Gillis\n\nThe post MLB Network analyst Ron Darling ranks his top 10 Starting Pitchers in 2026 appeared first on The Big Lead.",

Even though Chelsea put up a strong fight late on, they have got work to do if they want to turn things around.\n\nAlejandro Garnacho scored twice after coming off the bench to keep Chelsea’s hopes alive, but the team clearly missed some creativity from the start.\n\nWhile Cole Palmer has not featured much under Rosenior due to injury, he showed what he can do by setting up two goals against Napoli in his return from the bench during a Champions League match.\n\nPalmer will be looking to make his mark if he returns to the line-up, especially with the spotlight on him and fellow England international Bukayo Saka.\n\nIt is a comparison that comes up often, and both have also been mentioned alongside Phil Foden in discussions about the top young talent in English football.\n\nWhen asked for his opinion, Chelsea great Eden Hazard did not hesitate to choose Palmer over Saka.\n\nThe former Belgium international also preferred Palmer when compared to Lamine Yamal, who has recently been shortlisted for the Ballon d’Or.\n\nPalmer equalled a club record in the Champions League with his two assists off the bench against Napoli. Nicolas Anelka is the only other Chelsea substitute to have achieved that.\n\nBoth of Palmer’s assists were finished by Joao Pedro, who later called him a ‘special’ player after the match.\n\nClub captain Reece James also spoke highly of Palmer, and it has become clear just how much his absence has been felt when he has not been available.\n\nLiam Rosenior may look to rest him against West Ham this weekend, keeping him fresh for their trip to the Emirates.",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid were handed a quick rematch with Jose Mourinho's Benfica in the draw for the Champions League play-off round on Friday, while reigning European champions Paris Saint-Germain will face domestic rivals Monaco.\n\nBenfica beat Real 4-2 in their final game of the league phase on Wednesday, with a 98th-minute goal by goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin proving decisive in allowing the Portuguese side to snatch the last play-off spot ahead of Marseille, who were eliminated altogether.\n\nThe defeat also nudged Madrid out of the top eight places in the league standings, which give direct access to the last 16, forcing them into this extra round.\n\nBenfica staged a remarkable recovery to take a play-off place -- they finished 24th in the 36-team league phase, the last qualifying spot -- by winning three of their last four matches after losing their opening four games.\n\nMourinho, 63, returned to the Lisbon giants for a second spell as coach in September. He was in charge of Real from 2010 to 2013 and won one La Liga title and one Copa del Rey while also taking them to the Champions League semi-finals in each of his three campaigns.\n\nThe clubs played each other in the 1962 European Cup final, with Benfica winning 5-3 to claim the last of their two titles to date.\n\nPSG slipped out of the top eight after winning only one of their last five outings in the league phase and finishing in 11th place.\n\nThey will go to Monaco for the first leg and will be wary of the principality side who beat them there in Ligue 1 in November.\n\nHowever, 2004 Champions League finalists Monaco have been in poor form, with just one win in six games since the turn of the year.\n\nThey are 10th in Ligue 1, 21 points behind leaders PSG. However, a 0-0 draw with Juventus on Wednesday allowed them to secure a play-off place in Europe.\n\nPSG also beat French opposition in the play-off round last season, hammering Brest 10-0 on aggregate before going on to lift the trophy for the first time in their history.\n\nElsewhere, Newcastle United will be strong favourites against surprise packages Qarabag of Azerbaijan, with the first leg to come in Baku.\n\nPSG and Newcastle know that if they win, they will play either Barcelona or Chelsea in the last 16. Real's possible last-16 opponents are Manchester City or Sporting, which would mean yet another trip to Lisbon in the latter case.\n\nBodo/Glimt, Norwegian champions in four of the last six years, were also surprise qualifiers for this stage and have been rewarded with a tie against last season's runners-up Inter Milan.\n\nJuventus will take on Galatasaray, while Atletico Madrid face Club Brugge. Borussia Dortmund play Atalanta and Bayer Leverkusen were drawn against Olympiacos.\n\nThe two-legged play-off ties will take place in February, with the winners advancing to the last 16 in March.\n\nAlready through to that stage are the top eight teams from the league phase, including five English Premier League sides in Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and City, as well as Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Sporting.\n\nThis season's Champions League final will be played in Budapest on May 30.",

    "fullText": "If you want to watch top pitching in high school baseball this season, stop by a Bay League game. During Thursday's media day at Mira Costa, three outstanding senior pitchers look physically and emotionally prepared to show how good they are.\n\nGarrett Jacobs from Mira Costa, a UCLA commit, Robby Zimmerman from Redondo Union, a UCLA commit, and Kai Van Scoyoc, a USC commit, are coming off good junior seasons. Add junior Jonah Cohen, a UCLA commit at Palos Verdes, and you have to feel sympathy for Bay League hitters this season.\n\nJacobs was the best of all last season, going 11-1. He had 103 strikeouts and 13 walks in 70 innings. Zimmerman, a 6-foot-6 left-hander, is the best pro prospect because of his size and potential. Van Scoyoc and Cohen will be a formidable one-two duo for Palos Verdes. They all know and like each other, so it should be fun for fans and players when they face off.\n\nZimmerman is a cousin of Redondo Union girls' volleyball standout Abby Zimmerman. Most of the Zimmermans are volleyball players except for Robby and brother Danny, who used to play baseball at Michigan. Yet invite him to the beach and he'll be happy to join in the family fun using his size to his advantage.\n\nTorrance and West Torrance also figure to be competitive in the Bay League. Torrance returns its top pitcher in junior Aiden Anaya, who's playing soccer right now. Joey Kim is expected to be a key pitcher for West Torrance.\n\nMira Costa players have the advantage of walking around or going to the store and running into a Dodger or pro player in Manhattan Beach. The school is holding its alumni game on Saturday and honoring five grads who have played in the major leagues in Kyle Karros, Chase Meidroth, Petey Halpin, Joe Moeller and Jim Pena.\n\nThis is a daily look at the positive happenings in high school sports.

    "description": "As the end of the window approaches, there are still a number of transfer questions to be answered at Swansea City.",
    "fullText": "Swansea City head into the final days of the mid-season window with Vitor Matos still waiting for answers regarding the various transfer questions surrounding his squad.\n\nIt could be that Swansea do business, with one or even two new faces a possibility, but it may be that there are no further additions following the signings of Joel Ward and Gustavo Nunes earlier this month.\n\nThere is also the possibility that players will follow Manuel Benson out of the door – but Matos does not yet know for certain who they will be.\n\nExits for a handful of fringe figures are being discussed, while it is not inconceivable that one of Swansea's big names will be sold – although it would take a head-turning bid to convince the Championship club to do business.\n\nAs the end of his first transfer window as Swansea's head coach approaches, Matos is fairly relaxed.\n\nThe mood might have been different but for the Matos-inspired upturn in form which, for the moment at least, has eased relegation concerns.\n\nAt the beginning of January the two positions where Swansea were particularly keen for reinforcements were right-back and wing.\n\nThose two boxes have been ticked with the signings of Ward and Nunes, yet that does not mean Swansea have shut up shop.\n\nMatos insists he is \"really happy\" with the squad at his disposal, yet he has left the door open regarding further signings.\n\n\"Transfer windows are always important to balance things, to have more depth in the squad or to improve one or two positions,\" Matos added.\n\n\"At the moment we have signed Joel and Gustavo, who are what I wanted in terms of transfers and the club as well, so let's move on and keep seeing.\"\n\nAssuming no key attacking player departs, the position of most interest to Matos is midfield, and more specifically a midfielder with the ability to operate as a number 10.\n\nAfter a little over two months at the helm, Swansea's head coach believes a creator behind the forward line would benefit his team.\n\nFinland international Leo Walta, a 22-year-old who plays in the Swedish top flight for Sirius, is among Swansea's potential targets – but there are others in the mix too.\n\nThe other possibility is that Swansea will sign a central defender, probably a youngster on loan, as a result of the unexpected loss of Kaelan Casey earlier in the window.\n\nWith Ricardo Santos free to leave before Monday's 19:00 GMT deadline, Ben Cabango and Cameron Burgess could soon be Swansea's only senior centre-backs.\n\nEven so, Matos is not desperate for a new face in defence because he feels he has cover options in Ward and on-loan Chelsea youngster Ishe Samuels-Smith.\n\n\"Let's see what the market says,\" Matos said regarding a possible Casey replacement.\n\n\"If there's a right one, yeah [it could happen], if there's not, I'm OK with it.\"\n\nMatos is happy with his options out wide despite the departure of Benson, whose miserable loan spell from Burnley has been cut short, and the news that Zeidane Inoussa will be sidelined for up to three months through injury.\n\nThe feeling is that Nunes, who has arrived on loan from Brentford, can compete with Ronald and Eom Jisung for game-time out wide, while there are others who can be pressed into action on the flanks if necessary.\n\nUp front Liam Cullen will provide back-up to leading scorer Zan Vipotnik, while Melker Widell could once again be deployed as a false nine if and when required as Swansea wait for Adam Idah to return after a hamstring problem.\n\nBobby Wales is Swansea's other option in attack as things stand but they could decide the young Scot's development will be best served by a loan move away for the remainder of this campaign.\n\nAs the Championship's leading goalscorer, Zan Vipotnik is sure to be attracting attention from elsewhere - and Matos acknowledges as much.\n\n\"I think it's always normal that interest can come, with clubs asking,\" he said.\n\n\"I think that's happens not only with us but with every club, [but there is] nothing that is major to say.\"\n\nThere is a big difference, of course, between clubs making enquiries and deals being struck.\n\nSwansea are under no pressure to sell in this window and there is no suggestion that Vipotnik is pushing through a move.\n\nNevertheless, Matos accepts there are no guarantees over his key players given that offers could arrive.\n\n\"There's so much movement in the market all the time,\" he said. \"You never know with the amount of clubs who have the financial possibilities to come and buy a player, where [a deal] is also a financial advantage for [Swansea]. We never know what can happen.\n\nLatest Swansea City news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to the latest Swansea City interviews, news and discussion on BBC Sounds\n\nAcademy products are 'part of the project' - Matos\n\n\"What we know is we want to keep the players with us and of course after that we want to add quality, if it's available and if it's the right profile we want.\"\n\nWhile some uncertainty remains surrounding Vipotnik, the suggestion is that Swansea would demand a huge fee before agreeing to a sale.\n\nThey would also need to find a replacement, which may explain why Birmingham City's Kyogo Furuhashi has been linked with a move to Wales this week.\n\nWhile the former Celtic frontman has his admirers at Swansea, a deal looks unlikely unless Vipotnik is sold.\n\nEthan Galbraith is the other Swansea player thought most likely to attract rival interest given his contribution this season but, as things stand, there is no indication that the versatile Northern Ireland international will move in this window.\n\nSwansea expect Galbraith to stay – and the plan is that Vipotnik will stick around too.",

He's such an important part, a big character, big experience for us.\n\n\"We will miss him, he's done a lot of good things for us.\"\n\nGrealish sustained the injury during Everton's 1-0 over his former club Aston Villa on 18 January.\n\nEverton, who are 10th in the table, are away to Brighton on Saturday.\n\nAsked if it was too early to think about Grealish's long-term future given his success at Everton prior to the injury, Moyes added: \"Far too early\".\n\nGrealish's recent form at Everton led to suggestions that he could earn a recall to the England squad and push for a place at the World Cup.\n\nHis most recent appearance came under caretaker manager Lee Carsley in October 2024.\n\nGrealish won three Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FA Cup after joining City from Aston Villa for a then British record £100m in 2021.\n\nBut he fell out of favour last season, making only seven league starts for City before being left out of the squad for the Club World Cup in the United States.\n\nLatest Everton news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Everton - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Rangers are interested in completing a deal for Southampton striker Cameron Archer before next Monday’s transfer deadline, according to Sky Sports journalist Mark McAdam. Rangers manager Danny Rohl wants attacking reinforcements at the Ibrox club and the Bears have been linked with Hansa Rostock striker Ryan Naderi. They have offered a new bid of around €3.6 million and a sell-on clause for him, but, the German club do not want to lose him. Rangers are now looking at other options to bring to the Ibrox club before the deadline.\n\nRangers also have Leeds United striker Joel Piroe on their radar, and Archer has emerged as the latest player to be linked with the Bears. The 24-year-old has four goals in 23 games for the Saints this term after notching five goals in 40 appearances last term. Archer has proven himself in the Championship, with 20 league goals to his name across three seasons in the division. The Aston Villa star had earlier loan spells at Preston North End and Middlesbrough and will bring enough experience to the Rangers attack having also featured for the likes of Sheffield United and Solihull Moors.\n\nSouthampton are hoping to secure a return to the Premier League at the end of the season and it remains to be seen whether they will be open to losing one of their key players. Rangers are desperate to get a deal for a new striker over the line before the deadline to boost their chances of pipping Hearts and Celtic to the Scottish Premiership title. They are just four points behind league leaders Hearts after 23 matches and having a stronger squad would come in handy in the coming games as the top-three battle for the top prize.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he is decertifying all aircraft made in Canada and threatened a 50% tariff on those planes until American-made Gulfstreams are certified in that country.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he is decertifying all aircraft made in Canada and threatened a 50% tariff on those planes until American-made Gulfstreams are certified in that country.\n\nTrump specifically said he was decertifying the Global Express, a business jet from Quebec-based Bombardier, along with “all aircraft made in Canada.”\n\n“Canada is effectively prohibiting the sale of Gulfstream products in Canada through this very same certification process,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “If, for any reason, this situation is not immediately corrected, I am going to charge Canada a 50% Tariff on any and all Aircraft sold into the United States of America.”\n\nThe threat is the latest episode in a prolonged spat between the US and its next-door neighbor since Trump took office last year.\n\nJust hours earlier, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he expects Trump to “respect Canadian sovereignty” after reports that Alberta separatists met with US officials. And a few days earlier, Trump threatened a 100% tariff on America’s second-biggest trading partner if it struck a trade deal with China.\n\nIt is unclear whether Trump has the legal authority to decertify aircraft; the White House has not released an executive order on any Canadian aircraft tariffs. Trump did not specify any mechanisms to decertify the planes in his post.\n\nNo president has ever decertified jets directly. The decision has always been left up to aviation safety experts at the Federal Aviation Administration, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director of industry consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory.\n\n“Using aircraft safety as a tool in a trade war is just an incredibly bad idea,” he said.\n\nBombardier issued a statement pointing out that it has 3,000 US employees spread across 9 US facilities, one of which, in Fort Wayne, Indiana, it has announced plans to expand. It also said it has 2,800 US suppliers.\n\n“Thousands of private and civilian jets built in Canada fly in the US every day,” said its statement. “We hope this is quickly resolved to avoid a significant impact to air traffic and the flying public.”\n\nTrump didn’t clarify whether the decertification action would apply to active or yet-to-be certified aircraft. But an industry source who spoke to CNN on background said that it was the industry’s understanding that it would apply to “new” private aircraft.\n\n“(There is) no indication from folks we’ve talked to that this would impact passenger aviation like Bombardiers that were manufactured 10+ years ago,” the source said.\n\nIf Trump does ground all Canadian-made jets, it would be a blow to US airlines and passengers. In addition to business jets, Bombardier makes the CRJ regional jets used on feeder flights, which typically take passengers from smaller airports to larger airports. United, Delta and American airlines all employ regional airlines that use CRJ on their feeder flights.\n\nBombardier also makes smaller commercial jets, the A220. But some of those A220 jets are made in the United States and some are made in Canada.\n\nSo far none of the regional airlines that provide those feeder flights have reported having planes grounded, Faye Malarkey Black, CEO of the Regional Airline Association, told CNN Thursday evening.\n\nThere are 648 passenger CRJ jets that were made in Canada that are in use by US airlines, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. Those planes are scheduled to make more than 2,600 flights daily, with a total of 175,000 available passengers seats every day.\n\nGrounding those planes would not only cause widespread disruptions to the US airline schedule, it could leave many smaller airports in rural areas without air service. Regional airlines are the only source of flights for 64% of US airports, according to the Regional Airline Association’s data.\n\n“I think this is aimed at business (jets),” another industry source, who asked not to be identified, told CNN Thursday evening. “I’m well aware of what the (social media) post said, that it was all aircraft. But I would be really shocked if the intent was to ground the fleet that serves so many of the president’s supporters.”\n\nTaking those CRJ jets out of the US air travel system would cause widespread chaos, Aboulafia said.\n\n“It would be a transportation disaster,” he told CNN. “If it’s only the Global Express, it’s not that big of a problem. But if it’s all Canadian-made jets … the (US air travel) system would be seriously impacted.”\n\nIt’s also not clear from the Truth Social post if “all aircraft” refers to just planes or also helicopters. Canada is a major supplier of civilian helicopters, including medical evacuation helicopters used to move critically ill and injured patients.\n\nCNN has reached out to the FAA for comment.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional context and developments.\n\nCNN’s Pete Muntean contributed reporting.",

    "description": "If you want to know the state of the art in GenAI model development, you watch what the Super 8 hyperscalers and cloud builders are doing and you also",
    "fullText": "If you want to know the state of the art in GenAI model development, you watch what the Super 8 hyperscalers and cloud builders are doing and you also keep an eye on the major model builders outside of these companies – mainly, OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI as well as a few players in China like DeepSeek.\n\nBut if you want to understand how enterprises are adopting GenAI for real work, you might better look to how Big Blue is doing peddling its hard, soft, and people wares to the Global 10,000. This is where GenAI has to take off if it is to become a sustainable, new wave in data processing.\n\nThus far, enterprises have been enthusiastic about the potential of GenAI, but they have not lost their minds like many companies did in fear during the Dot Com Boom. There are no blank checks, but there are no blank stares, either.\n\nArvind Krisha, IBM’s chief executive officer, has a nuanced view of how AI – and particularly AI inference – might play out in the real world, not in the rarified air of the hyperscalers, cloud builders, and model builders. This is not a new theory, but a strategy that IBM has had four nearly a decade, when it started to work on tensor math engines for its Power10 and z16 compute engines, which are used in the most mission-critical back office systems of record on the planet. The Power11 and z17 have improved tensor cores as well as the vector units that have been part of IBM’s compute engines for decades now, and sales of these processors have been ramping over the past year.\n\n“I do think that there is going to be a lot of concern around the nature of what are the models learning from answering these questions, and do we really want to share that with everybody else or not,” Krishna explained on a call with Wall Street analysts going over the company’s financials for the fourth quarter of 2025. “There are going to be issues around sovereignty – on the uses of these models – and there is going to be questions around just basic privacy. If I look out three to five years, 50 percent of the enterprise usage of AI is going to be in either a private cloud or in their own datacenters, and the other 50 percent is going to be usage of public models. Now there’s also an efficiency question. So if what’s being used on premise is smaller models, then actually it could be that 80 percent to 90 percent of all the inferencing is really in private/on premise, and 10 percent of the inferencing is on a public cloud, but that 10 percent could be at 5X to 10X the price and hence the dollars sort of even out.”\n\nIBM is very much focused on this, which is why it has created its own models as well as packaged up open source and closed source ones in its WatsonX tools, and it is also why it has created several different code assistants to help customers with Power or System z servers to modernize their code using GenAI. It is not clear how many enterprise customers are using these code assistant tools, with Project Bob (which uses IBM models as well as those from Anthropic) being the latest iteration, but there is a skills shortage for these vintage IBM platforms and code assistants are going to fill in the gaps.\n\nIt is not clear how much business at IBM in the final quarter of 2025 was driven by AI, but we do know one thing for sure: It is going to be harder to figure it out going forward.\n\nSince the third quarter of 2023, Big Blue has been providing cumulative bookings for software and consulting relating to GenAI. And a few quarters ago, it only gave out the combined number for bookings. And, according to IBM chief financial officer Jim Kavanaugh, this will be the last time Big Blue provides and stats on AI bookings because, as he put it, these numbers do not accurately reflect the totality of AI revenues from IBM’s enterprise customers.\n\nKrishna said that cumulative AI consulting bookings since Q3 2023 were more than $10.5 billion and cumulative AI software bookings were more than $2 billion, for a combined more than $12.5 billion. We filled in some of the gaps in what IBM said to give you a better model in the table above. (Estimates are in bold red italics, as usual.)\n\nTo put these numbers in a little perspective, over that same time from Q3 2023 to Q4 2025, IBM had $100.8 billion in revenues, and the backlog of AI stuff might stretch out over several years into the future. These bookings, therefore, represent a fairly small share of revenues to date. We also think IBM does not want people to see how little bookings – and therefore revenues – it is getting selling its own GenAI models and tools in a world where OpenAI did around $20 billion in business in 2025 and is projecting $30 billion in 2026, and Anthropic did maybe $6 billion to $7 billion in 2025 with an annualized run rate of $9 billion as it exited the year and will do maybe $18 billion in 2026.\n\nHere is the big table showing how the IBM groups and divisions did over the past two years:\n\nSo, IBM awaits its GenAI fortunes as it learns how to deploy it internally to cut costs and drive revenues so it can sell that knowledge and products, Big Blue’s core systems business is doing well – and not the least of which because its server platforms are AI-ready and, in the case of the System z17 mainframes and their “Telum-II” processors, are having a bit of a boom.\n\nIn the quarter, IBM’s Infrastructure group, which sells servers, storage, switches, and systems software, had sales of $5.13 billion, up 20.6 percent year on year and had a pre-tax income of $1.6 billion. Sales of hardware and systems software were up by 29 percent to $3.85 billion in our model, and tech support for infrastructure was up 1 percent to $1.29 billion.\n\nIBM does not report server revenues uniquely, but did say that System z sales were up 67 percent while sales of Power Systems and storage products together – what it calls “distributed infrastructure” when most of it is for enterprise-class back office iron – was up 3 percent.\n\nIBM’s Software group had sales of just a tad over $9 billion, up 14 percent, with pre-tax income of $3.4 billion. Red Hat accounted for about $2.27 billion of that in our model, up 10 percent, and transaction processing systems for mainframes accounted for $2.59 billion, up 8 percent. The rest of the software group was development tools, AI tools, databases, and software-defined storage, what IBM used to call Hybrid Platforms & Solutions. (Our charts keep the old names for now.)\n\nThe Consulting group drove $5.35 billion in sales, up 3.4 percent, with Strategy and Technology up 2 percent to $2.9 billion and Intelligent Operations (which is really application hosting) up 5 percent to $2.4 billion. Krishna said, by the way, that GenAI represented 25 percent of its current $32 billion revenue backlog and around 15 percent of consulting revenue. The annualized run rate for GenAI consulting was $3.6 billion as Q4 2025 came to an end.\n\nRed Hat’s OpenShift Kubernetes platform, which has AI variations with models and frameworks built in, is driving north of $2 billion in revenues a year and growing at 30 percent a year.\n\nAnd finally, in the quarter, IBM’s “real” systems business – the hardware, software, services, and financing of the basic systems in the System z and Power Systems families but not including development tools, databases, security, and application software – had $9.42 billion in sales in our model, with a pre-tax income of $5.18 billion, or 55 percent of revenues.\n\nThis is one of the largest system and most profitable businesses in the world, and it is important to remember that as we look at the next wave of AI. No, IBM is no Nvidia. But then again, Nvidia is no IBM, either.",

    "fullText": "With the incredible market demand around DDR5 memory and significantly elevated pricing on the more premium DDR5 memory modules, as part of the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D launch there's been some communication that thanks to 2nd Gen AMD 3D V-Cache, using lower memory speeds like DDR5-4800 can be suitable without much of an impact to the gaming performance. But what about for Linux gaming? And other workloads with the Ryzen 7 9850X3D? Complementing yesterday's Linux review of the Ryzen 7 9850X3D are benchmarks of DDR5-4800 vs. DDR5-6000 performance with Ubuntu Linux and this new 3D V-Cache 8-core / 16-thread desktop processor.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D Linux review was done with the GSKILL DDR5-6000 EXPO memory along with the other tested processors while today's article is evaluating the performance of the 9850X3D across 300+ workloads when paired running at DDR5-4800 speeds.\n\nAMD's messaging with the Ryzen 7 9850X3D with DDR5-4800 is that for gaming there can be minimal performance impact compared to using DDR5-6000. They cited 2 x 16GB DDR5-4800 DIMMs costing around $400 to 2 x 16GB DDR5-6000 DIMMs for around ~$470 USD. The prices are very volatile still and so the testing in this article is focusing solely on the performance impact and thus the performance-per-dollar/value being an exercise for the reader depending upon your local memory pricing and whether you'd plan to re-use existing DDR5 memory in your possession or not.\n\nThese benchmarks are mainly done for reference purposes in seeing the performance difference of DDR5-4800 vs. DDR5-6000 not only for gaming but other workloads to help you decide in the cost/benefits of opting for DDR5-6000+ as opposed to potentially going for lower-cost DDR5-4800 DIMMs or re-using some existing DIMMs if you are considering an upgrade to the new AMD 3D V-Cache Zen 5 processors.\n\nThe testing with the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D on the ASRock X870E Taichi was done while running Ubuntu 25.10 with the Linux 6.17 kernel. Thanks to AMD for supplying the review hardware for making this independent benchmarking comparison possible.",

    "title": "AI health care is taking off in China, led by Jack Ma's Ant Group",
    "description": "Ant’s health chatbot has become a top downloaded app in China as users seek personalized care they can’t get from the overburdened hospitals.",
    "fullText": "Ant Group, Alibaba’s fintech affiliate and parent of China’s ubiquitous payment app Alipay, is racing to lead the country’s digital health market with a chatbot designed to be a wellness companion.\n\nIts app, Ant Afu, uses artificial intelligence and agentic capabilities to answer health-related questions, suggest hospital appointments, analyze test results, and remind users to exercise or take medication. First created in June under the name AQ, it had recorded 30 million monthly active users by January, with more than half of them living in small cities, according to Ant Group’s chief executive Han Xinyi.\n\nInternet users have increasingly turned to AI for everyday health questions and companionship, especially in markets where access to physicians is limited. Despite concerns about patient safety and data privacy, products like Ant Afu are widely embraced in China as consumers seek more personalized, round-the-clock health support.\n\nChina’s primary care system is underdeveloped. Most people seek treatment for everything from the flu to cancer at sprawling, overcrowded public hospitals that are concentrated in big cities. Patients often complain of long wait times, short consultations, and poor bedside manner of exhausted clinicians.\n\nThis demand for better care, combined with a fast-aging population, has created a fertile ground for digital health products that can spare people the burden of visiting hospitals. Tech companies including JD.com, ByteDance, and Baidu have all built online medical consultation tools, and more recently, chatbots branded as AI doctors.\n\nAnt has a unique advantage as Alipay has long hosted the appointment and payment systems for many hospitals. Millions of people access their national medical insurance accounts through Alipay. In January 2025, Ant acquired Haodf, a leading online consultation portal with more than 300,000 registered physicians.\n\nIn the U.S., AI companies are also expanding their health-care offerings, but they do not yet offer direct access to the country’s large number of private providers and insurers. This month, both OpenAI and Anthropic announced tools targeting consumers, health-care providers, and clinical researchers. Both ChatGPT and Claude now offer features that analyze users’ medical reports and fitness data.\n\nAmong its domestic rivals, Ant’s extensive partnerships with regulators, hospitals, and doctors give it an edge in the AI health-care race, Ivy Yang, a China tech analyst and founder of New York-based consulting firm Wavelet Strategy, told Rest of World. On Ant Afu, users can ask health-related questions, book online consultations and offline appointments at major hospitals, and get reimbursed by state or commercial insurance.\n\n“For startups, the bureaucratic red tape and initial investment required to build the platform, be compliant with all health-care data [regulations], and deal with various government agencies seem like too big a hurdle to overcome,” Yang said.\n\nAnt’s foray into health care has been endorsed by its billionaire founder Jack Ma. He came up with the name Afu, because it made the chatbot sound like a friend, chief executive Han told Chinese tech outlet Latepost this month. “He really cares about whether or not Afu can be like an AI friend that offers emotional companionship and humane care,” Han said, “rather than being just a tool for solving professional problems.”\n\nMa hopes to one day launch the app in underdeveloped parts of Africa and Southeast Asia, Han said.\n\nAnt has spent tens of millions of dollars marketing Afu in China, according to Han. Ant Afu ads have popped up in subway stations, on social media feeds, inside public restrooms, and have been painted on walls in rural China, according to photos shared online. By the end of January, Ant Afu ranked among the top ten most-downloaded iOS apps in China, according to Sensor Tower data.\n\nThe expanding role of AI in patient care, a largely unregulated area, has also prompted warnings about misinformation around the world.  A recent investigation by The Guardian found that Google’s AI summaries were giving out inaccurate health advice. Academics have also found AI diagnostic tools to harbor racial or socioeconomic biases.",

    "fullText": "Some people like reading or long walks. Others like olive oil.\n\nBut would you list olive oil as an interest on your résumé? That's the latest internet debate after a post about the interests section on résumés went viral on X.\n\nThe person, who said they were reviewing résumés for a banking role, wrote that applicants needed to be \"normal\" and \"well adjusted.\"\n\n\"I reviewed a resume that listed 'olive oil' as an interest. That is not an interest,\" they wrote. \"It's been hours and I cannot stop thinking about it. There will not be an interview.\"\n\nThe identity of the X user, @90daysliquidity, isn't clear, but they list \"Tech Analyst\" in their bio. They did not respond to a direct message from Business Insider.\n\nCannot stress how much of an advantage it is to be a normal, well adjusted, applicant for banking roles. \n\nI reviewed a resume that listed “olive oil” as an interest. That is not an interest. It’s been hours and I cannot stop thinking about it. There will not be an interview.\n\nThe post caused a stir online. Memes abound, both celebrating and scoffing at the supposed olive oil-enjoyer.\n\nAn employee at Elon Musk's xAI commented that they would hire a \"cracked finance professional\" who is interested in olive oil.\n\n\"If you have olive oil as an interest on your resume, we want to talk to you,\" the official Coinbase account posted.\n\nIs it really so bad to list \"olive oil\" — or any offbeat hobby — on your résumé? Business Insider asked five recruiters what they thought.\n\nPaula Mathias Fryer would want to see just one more word added.\n\nThe SLO Partners senior director from California has been a technical recruiter for 15 years. She would have preferred olive oil \"taster\" or \"grower,\" she told Business Insider.\n\n\"It would have explained it a bit more,\" she said. \"Just those two words is a bit odd.\"\n\nBrianne Sterling, a New York-based director at Selby Jennings who leads investment banking recruitment, also wants more information. Are they just eating olive oil all day long?\n\n\"Do you make your own olive oil?\" Sterling said. \"If someone made their own olive oil, I would find that really interesting, and I might want to speak to them.\"\n\nSterling is a fan of chocolate, but doesn't plan on putting it on her résumé anytime soon.\n\nHobbies offer a common interest between the applicant and the hirer, Sterling said. She listed some popular ones in investment banking: football, basketball, travel, and World War II history.\n\nIt poses a question: what makes a good résumé hobby?\n\nThe off-limits topics are more obvious: politics, religion, anything you wouldn't talk about at the dinner table. Picking the best hobby, on the other hand, depends on the recruiter.\n\nMargaret Buj, a London-based principal recruiter at Mixmax, wants candidates to be interesting. Olive oil was \"weird\" to her — but better than the answers that are \"cliché and vague.\"\n\n\"Traveling, socializing, reading,\" Buj said. \"Who cares? We all do that.\"\n\nSpace on a one-page résumé is a precious resource. Hobbies don't display relevant work experience, and they don't directly show what your contribution to the team would be. Is it even worth listing them?\n\nMathias-Fryer used to vote no. She saw hobbies as \"less professional,\" an unnecessary waste of space. Then came AI, which has upended recruitment and filled hiring managers' inboxes with identical, ChatGPT-generated CVs.\n\nApplicants now need to do \"whatever they can do to stand out,\" she said. \"If that's a hobby, so be it.\"\n\nMatt Stevenson disagrees. The New York-based managing director of executive search agency 33eleven loves to see a quirky hobby. It's another thing to connect about, he said. But, on the candidate side, Stevenson thought that hobbies were too risky.\n\n\"You don't know who is going to be reviewing that résumé, what their hobbies are, and what their personality is like,\" he said.\n\nAs for that X user, endlessly thinking about the olive oil-loving applicant?\n\n\"I would pick up the phone and call the guy,\" he said. \"Scratch that itch.\"",

    "description": "The manager opened up an evergreen private credit fund to new capital at the start of the year.",
    "fullText": "There's a flood of money rushing to the biggest deals in private-credit land, and it's starting to squeeze returns for the end investors.\n\nIn recent years, managers like BlackRock, Ares, D.E. Shaw, Blackstone, and others have raised massive funds, acquired long-standing private debt players, and launched new units to lend to companies and projects, with many focusing on infrastructure, both physical and digital.\n\nBut that much competition for deals means lendees, not lenders, have their pick of a partner and can negotiate for more favorable terms, which has tamped down return expectations for the asset class.\n\nPrivate credit was the hottest asset class with institutional investors just two years ago, but has since had declining interest due to concerns about rising default risk, according to a recent Goldman Sachs survey of hedge fund allocators.\n\nAnd yet, despite these emerging headwinds, alternative asset manager New Holland Capital is deciding to open its private credit strategy, called Special Opportunities, to new cash.\n\nThe reason: \"We're seeing no spread compression in deals we are looking at,\" said Andrew Parchman, a partner at the firm.\n\nWhile big-name direct lending strategies run by the industry's titans might be feeling pinched, \"there's a lot less erosion\" in the \"funkier things\" the firm's smaller strategy looks at, said Scott Radke, the firm's co-chief investment officer.\n\nNew Holland, which began as an investment advisor for Dutch pension plans before spinning off, now manages close to $7 billion across liquid and illiquid bets, including stakes in external hedge funds and a new group of internal traders.\n\nThe firm has been running its Special Opportunities strategy for its long-standing Dutch clients since 2020 and opened it to new money for the first time at the start of the new year. It's an evergreen fund that looks to turn over its positions relatively quickly and has interested family offices \"who might be a little skeptical of direct lending,\" Radke said.\n\n\"It's not the same investment that it used to be several years ago,\" Radke said about the standard direct lending strategy that private credit is known for. Data from With Intelligence shows that LPs don't have the same appetite for the space's bread-and-butter as they once did; in 2025, direct lending strategies raised $106 billion, compared to $141.8 billion in 2024.\n\nThe focus for New Holland is on deals or events that aren't scalable or repeatable, meaning they fall under the radar of the biggest players, Parchman said. The strategy is seeking quicker \"bridge-style deals\" and will partner with specialty funds on one-off deals, he said. In 2025, the firm both deployed and realized over $250 million across the strategy.\n\nThe manager will lend to deals that offer both tangible and intangible assets as collateral — think a fleet of private jets or the intellectual property of a new prescription drug in trial phase — as well as time-sensitive deals and quirky partnership opportunities sourced through the firm's network.\n\nAny slowdown in private credit fundraising due to jitters about the credit landscape will give players like New Holland more say on deal terms, Parchman believes.\n\n\"You're even less likely to get tourists coming in,\" he said.\n\nCorrection: January 30, 2026: The article has been updated to remove Millennium. The firm does not run a direct lending strategy.",

Stops back home in Canada, and a trip to Argentina had already been penciled in.\n\nAt the time, I didn't realize that moving forward, that trip would quietly replace New Year's resolutions altogether.\n\nFor those six weeks, I settled into rural rhythms. I woke just as the sunlight turned golden, watching green parrots glide overhead. I visited a ranch where locals rode horses and practiced lassoing. I ran up steep country roads, ate the area's famous chicharrón (a success), and tried to milk a cow (a colossal failure).\n\nThe experience was phenomenal. But one evening, as I cooked a simple meal in San José, a pang of homesickness hit me. I found myself thinking about my chosen home of Cuenca, Ecuador — the familiar parks, my apartment, my regular running route.\n\nThe more I thought about it, the clearer it became: My wanderlust had been satisfied. I wasn't craving reinvention. Instead, I was ready to return home.\n\nThat January trip set the tone for my year more effectively than any New Year's resolution ever had. I returned to Cuenca with clarity and spent the year deepening my roots there. I made new friends, took up Pilates, and built a routine that felt grounding rather than restless.\n\nIn previous years, I'd set ambitious goals on January 1, only to abandon them weeks later — foggy from holiday excess and disconnected from what I actually wanted.\n\nThis time was different. By stepping away first, I stopped obsessing over starting somewhere new and learned how to recognize the difference between restlessness and genuine curiosity.\n\nThe trip was so clarifying that I decided to make it a habit. I now schedule a trip at the beginning of each year and wait to reflect on my goals afterward.\n\nLast year, that reset meant spending time on Ecuador's coast. I rented a small cabin and focused on writing projects. I developed a list of story ideas, wrote several essays, and sold them over the course of the year.\n\nWith distance from my regular routine, I gained perspective — and a renewed appreciation for the life I'd already chosen.\n\nThere's a strong case to be made that travel can be a better catalyst for clear goal-setting than the disorienting comedown that follows a month of social overload, overspending, late nights, and heavy food.\n\nIf your 2026 resolution has already fizzled — and most do — it may not be a discipline problem so much as a timing one. The year is still young, and clarity doesn't always arrive on January 1.\n\nTravel is how I start the year with intention, but I'm not talking about lavish vacations or luxury hotels. Unless you can afford that, in which case — love that for you.\n\nTravel can feel lofty or far-fetched if you let it. Or it can be practical and affordable with a little creativity.\n\nDuring my Costa Rica stay, I lived with a friend and split costs on road trips. In Ecuador, I rented a small cabin for $250 a month.\n\nJust days after welcoming 2026, I packed trekking poles into my backpack and boarded a bus headed north in Ecuador.\n\nFor three days, my brother and I trekked through small Andean towns, walking across terrain where potato crops cling defiantly to craggy cliffs and women in crisp hats tend to flocks of bleating sheep. We climbed along the edge of a gorge that splits this part of the Andes in two.\n\nWe barely passed another person as we made our way toward a volcano that holds a turquoise lake deep inside its crater.\n\nSomewhere along a green ridgeline, my focus for the year crystallized. I knew I needed more of this — more adventure, more nature, more challenge — and far less of what didn't come close.\n\nThat's why I no longer try to reinvent my life on January 1. I let the year speak to me first. By the time February arrives, I'm not chasing resolutions, I'm responding to clarity I've already earned.",

    "description": "Tesla is giving the Model S and Model X the ax. Recent sales figures help explain why.",
    "fullText": "Tesla is taking its Model S and Model X to pasture.\n\nThe automaker will end production of the $94,990 sedan and $99,990 SUV next quarter, CEO Elon Musk said on Wednesday's earnings call.\n\nBased on recent delivery numbers, the decision isn't particularly surprising.\n\nTesla does not break out Model S and Model X sales individually; instead, it groups them with the Cybertruck under \"other models.\" Still, earnings presentations suggest demand for the category has been declining for years.\n\nIn 2025, Tesla sold 50,850 \"other model\" units worldwide — accounting for just over 3% of the automaker's 1,636,129 sales.\n\nThe \"other model\" figures are also down sharply from prior years. Tesla sold 85,133 vehicles in the category in 2024 — the first full year of Cybertruck deliveries.\n\nThat means sales fell about 40% in 2025, far steeper than the roughly 7% declines for the Model 3 and Model Y.\n\nThe soon-to-be-discontinued cars will remain an important part of Tesla's history. The Model S, launched in 2012, was the automaker's first car built from the ground up. The Model X came three years later, giving the company a foothold in America's best-selling vehicle category, the SUV.\n\nThe Model X has faced reliability issues from the jump. The car's sweeping gullwing doors were difficult to mass assemble, Musk said, calling the vehicle a \"Fabergé egg\" during a 2019 earnings call.\n\nAnd while Tesla refreshed much of its lineup in 2025, the Model S and Model X received comparatively modest design updates — a contrast with the more aggressive changes to the Model 3 and Model Y.\n\nInstead of chasing a revival of the aging car's sales, Tesla said it is discontinuing the program's production in favor of its Optimus humanoid robot. Musk projects building one million bots a year.\n\n\"It's time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we're really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,\" Musk said, adding that the decision was \"slightly sad.\"\n\nThe move underscores how far Tesla has shifted away from its legacy luxury models as growth slows and Musk pushes the company toward robotics and autonomy.\n\nStill, analysts aren't fully sold on the idea that Tesla's manufacturing switch-up will lead to immediate profits or sales results.\n\n\"The company appears to be on track with the rollout of Robotaxi service in nine US cities, alongside the start of production for the Cybercab and Semi,\" Steve Man, the senior auto industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told Business Insider. \"But we believe a commercially ready Optimus robot remains at least a couple of years away.\"\n\nTesla didn't respond to Business a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Dan Priest, PwC's chief AI officer, told Business Insider that companies should focus on quality not quantity when it comes to AI agents.",
    "fullText": "The AI race can sometimes feel like a numbers game.\n\nEarlier this month, Bob Sternfels, the CEO of McKinsey & Company, made a surprising announcement. The firm, he said, had a workforce of over 60,000 people — 40,000 human employees and 25,000 AI agents.\n\nFor Sternfels, it was an example of McKinsey's all-in approach to AI. Others in the industry, however, say the eye-popping number actually says little about the company's successful adoption of artificial intelligence.\n\nDan Priest, the chief AI officer at PwC, told Business Insider that evaluating a firm's AI use by the number of agents it has is not the best metric.\n\n\"There was this emerging bragging right around the number of agents I had or I have in production,\" he said. \"I think that's probably the wrong measure.\"\n\nThe value of AI deployment is better measured by the quality — not the quantity — of agents, he said.\n\nHe said one way to do that is to look at the number of agents that are authorities on a given task, which will encourage humans to use them, Priest said. The other is to evaluate the number of humans using those agents to execute tasks to achieve a prioritized outcome for a company. An example could be a better customer experience by transforming a call center.\n\nOver the past two years, agents have come to dominate how companies talk about AI adoption. Priest said that focus on agents is the right approach. \"Agents are at a place now where they're the best way to unlock value from AI,\" he said.\n\nHumans still drive the workforce, however, and a better way to measure an agent's value is by how effectively people use them — not just by how much work the agents have the potential to automate.\n\nAt PwC, about 82% of its employees were actively using the firm's AI tools. Priest said that AI agents are embedded across teams at PwC, and the firm tracks how agents interact, how accurately they complete tasks, whether they are making processes faster, higher quality, or higher performing. Humans have a role in reviewing agents' output and providing feedback.\n\n\"The human is still accountable,\" he said. \"The humans are the ones who get certified. The humans are the ones who get licensed. The humans are the ones who get empowered.\"\n\nPriest said that PwC and its clients first took a bottom-up approach to AI adoption. Many business leaders, he said, tried to \"crowdsource\" approaches to adoption from employees because they themselves didn't have the answers.\n\nThat led to a \"fairly disappointing\" return on investment, he said.\n\nPriest said a shift to a \"top-down\" approach has been more effective, allowing them to focus on fewer agents with a deeper mastery of a smaller set of tasks.\n\n\"That agent, I've given them permission to access certain data sets,\" he said. \"I've given them permission to perform certain tasks. I've given them permission to produce certain outcomes. Those permissions are monitored, they expire, they're managed.\"",

    "fullText": "A leaked Amazon Web Services organizational chart shows the 15 executives under CEO Matt Garman, plus changes to his reports over the past year.\n\nAWS is Amazon's massive cloud-computing unit. Garman, a longtime Amazon veteran, began leading in June 2024 after running sales and marketing. AWS teams were among those impacted by the company's recent mass layoff targeting 16,000 employees.\n\nBusiness Insider wrote about Garman's org chart a year ago. A comparison to the previous org chart shows the six new executives who became his reports, the 10 executives who stayed on his org chart, and the two executives who left since January 2025.\n\nBrad Bonnett, VP, Technical Advisor:\n\nBonnett is an Amazon boomerang who rejoined the company in 2024 after a two-year stint at Google. Bonnett is Garman's new technical advisor. Laura Grit was listed as technical advisor in Garman's January 2025 org chart.\n\nChet Kapoor, VP, Security Services and Observability:\n\nKapoor joined Amazon in October from his previous post as CEO and chairman of DataStax, an AI data company acquired by IBM last year.\n\nG2 Krishnamoorthy, VP, AWS Database Services:\n\nKrishnamoorthy runs database services, including Redshift and Aurora. He joined Amazon in 2022 from Meta, where he was most recently head of AI infrastructure.\n\nDavid Brown, VP, AWS Compute & ML Services, EC2:\n\nBrown is a nearly 19-year Amazon veteran who runs services including Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud, or EC2, intended to allow customers to easily scale up and down their cloud usage on AWS using virtual servers.\n\nMai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec, VP, AWS Tech:\n\nTomsen Bukovec joined AWS in 2010 and is a high-profile executive at Amazon, known for running key services, including Simple Storage Service (S3), the first cloud service AWS introduced.\n\nSwami Sivasubramanian, VP, Agentic AI:\n\nSivasubramanian became head of Agentic AI in March 2025 and is known for launching popular AI platforms, including Amazon SageMaker and Bedrock.\n\nPrasad Kalyanaraman, VP, AWS Infrastructure Service:\n\nKalyanaraman has spent more than 20 years at Amazon and took over infrastructure and network services in 2021. Kalyanaraman, in an internal memo viewed by Business Insider after the company announced plans to lay off 16,000 employees, wrote that his org in the past year has \"made tremendous progress on scaling to meet unprecedented customer demand.\"\n\nColleen Aubrey, SVP, AWS Applied AI Solutions:\n\nAubrey has spent more than 20 years at Amazon but switched to AWS in May, around the time ex-AWS CEO Adam Selipsky left. She leads the AWS unit responsible for business applications. Aubrey is a member of Jassy's S-team. A calendar invite sent on behalf of Aubrey this week shared details about the company's layoff plans before they were announced.\n\nElizabeth Baker, VP, Private Pricing:\n\nBaker has been at Amazon since 2016 and runs the unit responsible for custom agreements between AWS and customers, including terms such as usage-based discounts. Baker's past roles include positions at SAP and Oracle.\n\nGreg Pearson, VP, AWS Global Sales:\n\nAfter Garman became CEO, Pearson integrated global sales teams under Pearson, combining AWS Global Sales, Worldwide Public Sector, the Greater China Region, and Sales Strategy and Operations.\n\nJulia White, VP, Worldwide AWS Marketing:\n\nWhite joined AWS in November 2025. She was most recently the chief marketing and solutions officer at SAP. Before that, she spent nearly two decades at Microsoft in roles including corporate vice president of product marketing for the Azure cloud unit.\n\n\"Julia will join my leadership team and further develop and execute our global marketing strategy, playing a pivotal part in AWS's growth,\" Garman wrote in an email announcing her appointment.\n\nLaura Grit, VP/Distinguished Engineer:\n\nGrit, an 18-year Amazon veteran, is Garman's previous technical advisor. She previously led Amazon.com's migration from on-premise data centers to AWS cloud services.\n\nRuba Borno, VP, AWS Specialists & Partners:\n\nBorno has been at AWS since 2021. When Garman took over, he put Borno in charge of a new unit combining its Channels and Alliances team, responsible for relationships between global partners and customers, and its Worldwide Specialist Organization, which connects service teams to customers.\n\nUwem Ukpong, VP, AWS Industries:\n\nUkpong now leads the organization responsible for industry-specific AWS products for customers, succeeding Kathrin Renz, who left in December.\n\nVogels is technically the chief technology officer of Amazon overall, but he has another important role within AWS, acting as one of the public faces of the company's cloud business and technical infrastructure.\n\nMissing from Garman's latest organizational chart are Peter DeSantis, previously listed as senior vice president of AWS Utility Computing, and Kathrin Renz, ex-VP of AWS Industries. DeSantis, this month, took on a new role overseeing a new AI organization, and Renz left the company in December, according to a LinkedIn post.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Target's new CEO is thrown into crisis mode on day one",
    "description": "Michael Fiddelke takes over the Target CEO job on Sunday. He must deal with declining sales and civil unrest in the retailer's hometown, Minneapolis.",
    "fullText": "Target's new CEO won't get a honeymoon period.\n\nMichael Fiddelke, the company's chief operating officer who started as a finance intern, is taking over at a moment when the retailer is under pressure on nearly every front, grappling with a weakening business, political backlash, and growing employee strain.\n\nFiddelke, who officially takes the helm this weekend, will have to contend with 10 of the past 12 quarters having flat or declining comparable sales, as civil unrest unfolds in Minneapolis, where Target is headquartered. Target's stock is down more than 25% in the past year.\n\nPeter Schwartz, a CEO coach of 20 years, told Business Insider that Fiddelke is facing a classic leadership paradox. He must balance sensitivity to a politically and socially charged moment with the non-negotiable responsibility of running a business.\n\n\"This is incredibly complex,\" said Schwartz, particularly if turning Target's fortunes around and improving employee relations calls for significant changes.\n\nA Target spokesperson declined to comment on this story.\n\nBeyond its financial struggles, Target has lost a lot of the goodwill and cultural appeal that once differentiated it from other big-box chains. After more than two decades on Fortune's list of 50 most admired companies, Target did not make the cut this year, even as competitors like Walmart and Costco landed in the top 10.\n\nFiddelke knows he has his work cut out for him. During the August earnings call after his promotion was announced, the incoming chief laid out a three-point plan to get Target back in the good graces of US shoppers: lean into Target's style bona fides, improve the in-store experience, and invest more heavily in technology.\n\n\"I'm stepping into the role with a clear and urgent commitment to build new momentum in the business and get back to profitable growth,\" he said.\n\nBut relations with Target's workforce and local communities have also been under strain, with several employees telling Business Insider that they are disappointed in the company's response to immigration enforcement activity in Minneapolis.\n\nLast week, hundreds of Target employees signed a letter urging the company to bar ICE from its stores and outlined other steps they want the company to take in response to ICE's actions.\n\nTaking the company in a new direction and implementing big changes will require Fiddelke to win over enough board members to support his vision for Target's future. This could be tricky because the board promoted Fiddelke while keeping longtime CEO Brian Cornell on as executive chairman, essentially preserving the status quo in Target's leadership.\n\nFormer Target Vice Chairman Gerald Storch told Business Insider that when a company takes on a new leader, the outgoing CEO should leave within about six months to make way for change.\n\n\"Otherwise, the new CEO is CEO in name only and doesn't have an opportunity to really thrive and exercise his own will,\" Storch, who left Target's board in 2005, said.\n\nTarget under Cornell's tenure delivered some strong business results while also championing progressive and inclusive issues, such as LGBTQ+ Pride and Black-owned businesses. Cornell also spoke out forcefully after the murder of George Floyd in 2020, saying that Floyd \"could have been one of my Target team members.\"\n\nBut as Target's financial performance faltered, the retailer retreated from social controversies, scaling back summer Pride collections and winding down some corporate DEI initiatives. The company also made its largest political donation, a $1 million contribution to Donald Trump's 2025 presidential inauguration fund.\n\nWith roughly 50 Target stores in the Twin Cities metro area and its headquarters in Minneapolis, Target has also been dragged into a national political firestorm. Corporate leadership did not comment publicly after federal agents detained two employees at an area store, as then-Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino marched through another with a heavily armed entourage, and as Target parking lots were used as ad hoc staging and detainee transfer sites.\n\nAfter a second Minneapolis resident was killed Saturday by Border Patrol, Fiddelke addressed employees Monday. He said in a video message that the recent violence and loss of life in the community \"is incredibly painful.\"\n\nLeadership experts told Business Insider this was the right move, but that Fiddelke faces a tough road ahead. He needs to stabilize the business, honor the rule of law, and still acknowledge that employees and communities are under real stress, said Jennifer Eggers, president of executive advisory firm LeaderShift Insights in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"If he over-indexes on ideology, he risks fragmenting the brand and the workforce. If he ignores the human tension entirely, he risks disengagement and erosion of trust,\" she said. \"Strong leaders navigate the middle with clarity and credibility and involve employees in the dialogue.\"\n\nDespite the headwinds, Fiddelke has some things working in his favor.\n\nCEO insiders tend to produce better results than their external counterparts, according to a 2025 Yale study of leadership transitions at Fortune 500 companies over the past five years. The findings show that CEO successors from inside delivered higher total shareholder returns than those from outside at the one-, three-, and five-year marks.\n\nNot only is Fiddelke a longtime Target employee, but he also has family ties to the Minneapolis community, which are advantages because they give him credibility, said Sarah Federman, associate professor of conflict resolution at the University of San Diego's Kroc School of Peace Studies.\n\nThose attributes signal to the company's workforce: \"I'm one of you, and I've been here a long time and so work with me,\" she said.\n\nFederman sees crises as opportunities for leaders to build or reinforce relationships with stakeholders by using words or actions that show support.\n\n\"This emotional security and feeling that your company has your back is going to matter,\" Federman said. \"It could create real company spirit.\"\n\nFiddelke could go even further by temporarily shutting down Target stores in Minneapolis or other areas where immigration agents are active, she said. \"That's a huge cost, but that would show his commitment to their employees,\" Federman said.\n\nStill, any radical moves could put Target in Trump's crosshairs, said Don Moore, a professor at the University of California-Berkeley's Haas School of Business who researches confidence. He described the incoming CEO's message to employees this week as a small act of bravery.\n\n\"It may be a sign that Fiddelke is finding his own voice,\" said Moore.",

    "description": "If you're looking to put some money to work in markets right now, Vanguard says it's generally a good idea to lean into bonds.",
    "fullText": "If you're looking to put some money to work in markets right now, Vanguard says it's a good idea to lean into bonds.\n\nIn fact, the asset management giant says the ideal portfolio at the moment is 60% bonds and 40% stocks, flipping the traditional advice for asset allocation.\n\nOf course, the ideal portfolio is different for each investor based on risk tolerance and timeline. But given where bond yields and stock valauations sit, bonds look like the more attractive of the two asset classes right now, says Kevin Khang, a senior global economist at Vanguard.\n\n\"Take the perspective seriously, but not literally,\" Khang said in commentary published on January 22. \"Our strategic allocation of 40% stocks and 60% bonds reflects our own assumptions about investment horizons, long-term capital market return projections, and risk tolerance.\"\n\nKhang's lackluster view on stocks stems from the AI boom seen over the last few years. While he still thinks stocks can outperform in the year ahead, high valuations driven by endless AI enthusiasm are likely to dampen long-term returns, as has historically been the case.\n\n\"Today's US equity market is led by a narrow group of mega‑cap technology companies and other rising stars spending hundreds of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure,\" Khang said. \"Many of these firms have extraordinary earnings power but also historically elevated valuations. Past high‑valuation, innovation-driven investment cycles offer a surprisingly consistent pattern: While real technological progress often follows historic investment cycles, long-term returns often fall short of historical averages.\"\n\nVanguard's upward-adjusted fair value levels show today's stock valuations rival those seen in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year Treasury yields sit at around 4.22% — offering robust income and plenty of cushion for appreciation if investors were to seek safety in bonds amid a stock-market pullback.\n\nDespite laying out his flipped 60/40 vision, Khang emphasized that his commentary shouldn't be taken as a recommendation to adopt such a portfolio construction immediately. Instead, one can start moving in such a direction as they put new money to work.\n\n\"Instead of treating the recommendation as a binary 'switch,' we suggest thinking in terms of direction and pacing,\" Khang said. \"Start with the next dollar. For investors still accumulating assets, this means directing new contributions toward the preferred allocation.\"",

Yet, that could be the very thing that comes back to bite his big affordability push, according to market pros, who say a weaker dollar could soon get in the way of the president's goal of lowering borrowing costs.\n\nTrump, who has made lowering borrowing costs a key goal of his second term, suggested he wasn't too pressed about the greenback's decline when speaking to reporters in Iowa this week.\n\n\"The dollar's doing great,\" Trump said, adding that he wanted the greenback to \"seek its own level\" — comments that sent the currency tumbling further to a four-year low.\n\nThe president has praised a weaker dollar before.\n\nLast year, he floated it as a positive, suggesting US firms could \"make a hell of a lot more money\" due to exports being more attractive broadly to foreign buyers.\n\nThe US Dollar Index, which weighs the dollar against a basket of other major currencies, is down around 10% over the past year, thanks to pressures like some investors shifting away from dollar-based assets and the Fed continuing its rate-cutting cycle.\n\nThere's just one problem: a weaker dollar doesn't bode well when it comes to making the case to lower interest rates. That's because a weaker currency lowers Americans' purchasing power abroad and could raise the cost of imported goods. Higher inflation could ultimately cause interest rates to rise — the opposite of what Trump is shooting for.\n\nJoe Kalish, a chief macro strategist at Ned Davis Research, said he believed the \"collapsing\" dollar could be Trump's \"Achilles' heel.\"\n\n\"If the new Fed Chair tries to push through a rate cut as soon as the June meeting, FX traders could smell blood in the water and punish the dollar, sending inflation expectations higher and worsening household affordability,\" Kalish wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.\n\nHe added that a soft dollar could result in a \"lose-lose\" situation when it came to lowering rates, even if Trump were to plug in a trusted ally as Fed Chair.\n\nA weaker dollar is also tied to the \"Sell America\" trade, the idea that investors are shifting away from US assets due to a worsening economic outlook. Investors dumping US bonds is part of that trade, something that would also cause yields to rise.\n\n\"The bond vigilantes would return and demand a higher term premium, forcing yields higher,\" Kalish added, referring to the potential for bond investors to stage a sell-off in government bonds as concerns rise over inflation, causing rates to rise in tandem.\n\nThe 10-year US Treasury yield, a key benchmark for other lending rates, was around 4.24% on Thursday, up two basis points this week. The move coincided with a 0.6 decline in the US Dollar Index over the same period.\n\nMore forecasters have been flagging the risk of higher yields due to a bond market revolt. Nela Richardson, the chief economist of ADP, said a weaker dollar could get in the way of the US's ability to sell Treasury bonds.\n\n\"A weak dollar at home doesn't always have the confidence of markets. And that confidence is going to be very important as we look at other things that are a struggle for the US economy, like sticky inflation, like high deficits and debts, and the need to sell treasuries,\" Richardson said.\n\nShe called a falling US dollar a \"double-edged sword\" when it came to Trump's economic agenda.\n\nRobert Kaplan, Goldman Sachs' vice chairman, also pointed out that a weak dollar would affect demand in the Treasury market.\n\n\"The United States has $39 trillion of debt on its way to $40 trillion plus,\" Kaplan said. \"I actually think the US is going to want to see a stable dollar and wants to see stability. And they want to be able to sell the long end of the Treasury curve. A stable dollar helps,\" he added.",

    "title": "Ukrainian troops were 'stunned' to learn their British trainers don't use anti-drone nets, UK officer says",
    "description": "Ukrainian soldiers getting combat training from the UK are feeding back key modern warfare lessons that the British Army is adopting.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian soldiers were shocked to learn that anti-drone nets weren't standard for the British Army when they came over for combat training, a UK officer told Business Insider.\n\nLt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion of the UK's Irish Guards — an infantry regiment with a long operational history — said he had never seen nets to stop drones used in his 20 years in the army.\n\n\"The Ukrainians were absolutely stunned,\" he said. For the Ukrainians, he shared, the view is \"well, of course you put nets over your positions because that's how you defend yourself.\"\n\nDrones have become ubiquitous in Ukraine and are behind most battlefield strikes, forcing both sides to protect personnel and weaponry from constant airborne threats.\n\nDefenses include low-cost options like nets, which can snag propellers and prevent drones from reaching their targets, be they soldiers or high-value equipment. Soldiers stretch the counter-drone nets over their fortified positions, weapon systems, and armored vehicles. The Ukrainians have also covered key roadways with netting to protect supply routes.\n\nUkrainians have been gathering up netting wherever they can find it to meet demand, even from the fishing villages of partner nations.\n\nThe Ukrainians told their British trainers they needed to get nets, and the UK military reacted fast, Irwin-Clark said.\n\n\"We went 'round every fishing port in the east of England asking for their old fishing nets,\" the officer shared, \"and we've now got hundreds and hundreds of meters of fishing nets, which we drape over positions when we conduct training.\"\n\n\"Are they exactly the right type of drone nets? Dunno,\" he said. \"But in terms of replicating it for training, that's the best we can do. It's entirely free, and it's a lesson we learned entirely from our Ukrainian brothers and sisters.\"\n\nHe said it was \"just one example\" of how Ukrainian front-line experience has shaped British training, with lessons passed on by soldiers arriving directly from combat and rapidly folded into UK doctrine.\n\nThe Irish Guards gained much of that insight during the deployment to Operation Interflex, the UK-led training program that has supported more than 62,000 Ukrainian soldiers, including both new recruits and combat veterans.\n\nSpeaking at a training demo recently attended by Business Insider, Irwin-Clark said that \"it's really inspiring working with the Ukrainians and training Ukrainians, and I think what I hadn't anticipated over a year ago when we started our stint on Interflex is how much we would learn.\"\n\nThe Operation Interflex training is meant to share Western and NATO doctrine with Ukrainian forces to help them fend off Russia's invasion. The exchange, however, has increasingly run both ways, with the UK armed forces modifying aspects of its own training based on Ukrainian input.\n\nUkraine is fighting a large-scale, high-intensity war against a major military power, something the UK and other Western forces have not experienced in decades. As a result, Ukrainian troops often have more recent, firsthand insight into what works, particularly in areas like drone warfare and trench fighting.\n\nBritish trainers say the dynamic works. Col. Boardman, the commanding officer for Operation Interflex, previously told Business Insider that there is a \"really rich mutual understanding going on\" and that the training \"ends up with the sum being much greater than the parts, which is really valuable for us.\" He spoke on the requirement that only his rank and last name be used.\n\nUkrainian soldiers, he said, might explain why a NATO-style tactic is likely to fail under real-world combat conditions and what they do instead. That knowledge is then combined with Western doctrine and used to refine training on both sides. The UK, for instance, adjusted its thinking on how trench battles are fought in response to Ukrainian combat experiences.\n\n\"We are learning an awful lot from our engagement with this war,\" Boardman said.\n\nHe said Ukraine places a lot of value on NATO and Western military doctrine because while \"they may have the current battle experience,\" the Ukrainians \"know that we have some of the history, some of the hard-won experience of this in the past.\"\n\nThe feedback shared during Operation Interflex also prompted the Irish Guards to make other changes, including investing heavily in drone warfare.\n\nIt has since created a new \"drone hub,\" the first of its kind in the British Army, where soldiers can repair drones and develop new ones, and train for drone warfare. It uses tech like 3D printing, a technology adopted on Ukrainian advice.\n\nIrwin-Clark said that out of the 300 people in the battalion, 78 are now pilots or instructors. Speaking at the training demonstration, he described drones as part of \"the future of warfare.\"\n\nOthers within the British Army have acknowledged Ukraine's help in developing the UK's drone warfare capabilities. Boardman, for example, highlighted drones as an area where Ukrainian troops have far more direct experience. \"They are very good at sharing the understanding with us,\" he said.",

    "description": "\"I live frugally and try to make sure that my investments and savings are there for any emergency or special occasion,\" said Noe Parenteau, 80.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on an interview with Noe Parenteau, 80, who lives outside Fort Myers, Florida. Parenteau works as an operations automation analyst and wishes he had more money to pay for his loved ones' medical care. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was considering retiring after I turned 80, but the cost of geriatric care is high. My sister and ex-wife both require care. My sister is in full-time memory care, and my ex-wife has needed more care over the past two years after a dementia diagnosis, so I decided to keep working.\n\nI'm trying to help support them, whether it's paying the care facility directly or paying them to provide some support or outside nurses. I'm not contributing too much right now. It's a tag team with my family to check up on them.\n\nI'm doing fine financially, but I don't really know if I would ever retire because I tried it once, and I was just sitting around doing nothing other than volunteer work. I have a good job and get overtime, which helps me set aside some money for other geriatric care we might need.\n\nI'm also a grandfather. My grandkids bring me great joy, even though I don't see them enough.\n\nI began my career in computer operations, handling peripheral equipment, before moving into a more software engineering support role. I moved to a bank in a supervisory role, took a buyout there, then worked at a data analytics company for 10 years. By then, I was in my 50s, so I took a three-year sabbatical.\n\nI worked a few other jobs in computer operations and project management after that. I took on a technical lead position, which is where I am right now. Also, I'm collecting pensions from a few businesses I worked with years ago, as well as Social Security.\n\nMy sister is in memory care, which costs around $7,000 a month.\n\nMy ex-wife also receives care. We were married for 17 years and divorced, but my four daughters have kept us all together as one group. Two of my daughters handle her finances and any regular interactions with the doctors. My ex-wife is a breast cancer survivor, and she continued to work as long as she could. But over the last two years, her health has gone sideways.\n\nMy daughters are really on the ball working with her. Her care costs about $5,000 a month. We're trying to keep her in an assisted living facility as long as we can. If we had to move her, the added care would cost as much as $6,000 to $7,000 a month. We do have some money set aside, but we really want to keep her in a nice facility we have confidence in, with fewer visitor restrictions than a memory care facility would.\n\nMy sister and my ex are in Wisconsin, and my daughters live in Minnesota, Chicago, and Milwaukee. Six months ago, I took a trip to Wisconsin to look for a home and relocate, but doing so would mean I would lose some of my earning power because there are more taxes there, and I don't have a car.\n\nI'll probably look into relocating again this summer, but I've come to realize that the best way I can help now is through financial support.\n\nOne of my sister's daughters is very close to her and checks on her regularly. She's earmarked some funds for her mother, and I told her that I could probably bear some of the costs, maybe $2,000 a month to keep her in memory care.\n\nWe're also seeking more Medicare dollars for my sister's support. If my sister's family has to exhaust their funds to support their mother, we may have to rely on the county or other family members who want to help. That's a sharp stick in the eye, especially when raising a family and having kids going to college.\n\nIt seems like this country doesn't spend a lot of money on geriatric care, and that's a sad story for such a wealthy nation.\n\nMy ex-wife's family has been known to live well into their 90s, and she's the same age I am. She could be in memory care for five to 10 years.\n\nIt's good that I can help, but for me to come up with what could be up to $12,000 to $14,000 a month, it would have to come out of my pension, savings, and investments. If I have to do it, I'll do it.\n\nThis is my second sister who has contracted dementia. My other sister was in assisted living and then went into memory care. She passed away about three years ago. My sister now has a lot of anxiety, and sometimes she can't put two and two together and gets frustrated by it. The symptoms of dementia are difficult to deal with unless you've gone through them and been prepared for them.\n\nI fear that the situation with my sister and ex-wife will trickle down to my daughters, so I continue working in case they need assistance if their savings deplete.\n\nI try to talk to my grandkids as much as I can, telling them that when I was their age or younger, most of these people didn't live in an elder care situation. They lived at home often.\n\nMy grandkids and I get together at Christmas, and I try to travel more to see them in the summertime when they're not all in school. Over the past decade or so that I've been living in Florida, I try to go up for an extended period of time, where I can take them to school and see them in their daily lives. I want them to see me as part of their daily lives, too.\n\nI live by myself and don't really go out. I live frugally and try to make sure that my investments and savings are there for any emergency or special occasion, whether it's a graduation or any educational or health issues that may arise. They may need a car or a down payment.\n\nI suspect the money I have set aside for retirement will be diminished over time. I'm reaching a point where I don't think there's going to be much there for me, and I'm sure my daughters would probably take me in. I suspect I'll one day be in the same situation that my sister and ex-wife are in.",

    "description": "Michael Knox runs a restaurant near Minneapolis. He said employees are afraid to come in, and even his regular customers have been absent.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Michael Knox, co-owner of Toma Mojo Grill near Minneapolis. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI run a fast casual chicken restaurant in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb just south of Minneapolis.\n\nWith ICE agents in the area, I don't know when — or if — staff will be able to come to work. We all have pretty set schedules, and we're tight-knit. There are only six of us operating this place, seven days a week. And I have concerns: Are my employees going to get stopped on their way to work? Are they going to be hassled or detained? Are they going to come back?\n\nIt's a day-by-day thing. Over the past couple of weeks, we've adjusted our hours, opening later and closing earlier. I've been picking up everyone's shifts, but I can't physically work 16 hours a day, seven days a week. We had to close last week so that I could have a day off. I had a doctor's appointment that I couldn't miss.\n\nSome of my employees don't feel comfortable leaving their houses. If they tell me they can't come to the restaurant, my policy, of course, is \"no questions asked.\" I get it. But I'm not a wealthy businessman. If we're not serving guests our food, there's no money coming in, and we can't pay people. I wish that we were at a place where we could offer better PTO benefits, but we're not. That's been hard.\n\nWe're just trying to keep our people safe and our employees comfortable. We have a big bay window at the front of the restaurant where the full kitchen is visible. I'm going to make some modifications to the space that will make it harder to see inside. We don't know who's looking in now, or what their purpose is. We put up cameras that we didn't have before — we need to have a record of whatever happens here.\n\nI worry that ICE agents will come to my business to abduct my staff. I also worry that they're going to come enjoy hospitality, and that's going to get out to the public. I can only do what I think is good for me, my staff, and the restaurant. ICE agents are bad for business, no matter which way they come.\n\nLast week, my sales were down about 40% year over year. There are fewer delivery drivers and gig workers, so our takeout food is sitting longer before pickup. Our walk-in business is suffering too: After the sun goes down, we're seeing almost a noticeable drop in sales. That didn't previously happen. Now I have regulars who I haven't seen in weeks.\n\nI went to the strike with my friends and family last week to voice our dissatisfaction with the situation. My employees and I thought it was important to close that day too. Shutting down a restaurant on a Friday in January is devastating. It's the busy day, the day that pays for the rest of the week. That's a big sacrifice — but I know it's important.\n\nWhat's happening in Minneapolis should horrify every American. There's a very real, pervasive fear about what's going to happen next. That's bad for business. That's bad for life. And I'm worried that there's going to be more loss of life.\n\nSmall business owners are brave people. It takes a lot of guts to put everything on the line do something you really want to do, to present a product or service that you think is good enough to charge money for. They don't tend to be the quiet type. I'm not surprised they're speaking up.",

    "description": "How much money do you have in retirement accounts? What about your brokerage? If you can't answer questions like these, it's time to do an account audit.",
    "fullText": "A 30-year-old who built a seven-figure net worth says the first step toward financial freedom isn't budgeting, investing, or cutting expenses. It's simply knowing where your money is.\n\nBefore focusing on growing wealth, Michela Allocca, founder of the personal finance brand Break Your Budget and author of \"Own Your Money,\" says people need a clear picture of what they already have.\n\nHow much money is in your retirement account? Do you have multiple retirement accounts? Do you have a brokerage account? If so, how much money is in there, and are you actively contributing to it? What about cash — do you have enough in cash, or do you have too much because you're afraid to invest?\n\nIf you can't answer these questions, set aside a weekend morning or weekday evening to sit down and do an \"account audit,\" said Allocca, who spent years in the corporate world before transitioning to full-time content creator. Since quitting, she's quadrupled her income.\n\nOnce you know where you're starting from, you can figure out how much you actually need to reach your goal, whether it's early retirement or becoming work optional.\n\n\"Looking at where your money is really is that first step,\" Allocca said. From there, she recommends using a financial independence calculator to map out realistic targets.\n\nSay you're trying to hit Coast FIRE, an offshoot of the Financial Independence, Retire Early movement, where you no longer need to contribute to your retirement accounts. Instead, the amount you've already invested is expected to grow and compound enough over time to support your retirement, allowing you to \"coast\" into your golden years.\n\n\"You can just go onto Google and very simply search up a financial independence calculator, plug in your numbers, and it will tell you, OK, you need to have, let's say, $250,000 invested in your retirement account by this age in order to reach Coast FIRE,\" she said.\n\nMaybe you're closer to that $250,000 number than you thought, or maybe you've already surpassed it. Whatever the case, now you have a specific goal and know exactly how far away or close you are to reaching it, thanks to your financial audit.\n\nKnowing whether you've hit, or are close to hitting, a milestone like Coast FIRE can be life-changing.\n\n\"You go to work to pay your bills in the present and to save for retirement in the future,\" Allocca said. \"So if you eliminate the need to keep saving for retirement, that opens up an entirely new financial reality for you.\"\n\nSuddenly, you have options. You can continue working your day job and redirect the money you would otherwise save for retirement toward other financial goals. Or, maybe you hate your job, and now, without the pressure to save tens of thousands of dollars a year for retirement, you could pivot to a lower-paying job you actually enjoy or take a sabbatical.\n\nThe problem is that many people never run the numbers.\n\n\"They're not seeing how close they are, or how close they could be with two or three years of diligence,\" she said, adding that she's no exception. \"If I had calculated my numbers years ago, I probably could have either hit these numbers sooner or had a different relationship with my finances. I wouldn't have been reaching for more and more, thinking I'd never have enough, because I would have known.\"",

    "description": "Leaders at Navient and Sallie Mae said that Trump's sweeping student-loan repayment changes will be a boon to their private lending business.",
    "fullText": "Private student-loan companies are gearing up for a big year ahead.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration is preparing to roll out its sweeping student-loan repayment changes beginning in July. Those changes include new repayment plans and caps on federal borrowing for advanced degrees.\n\nSome companies see those changes as an opportunity for the private lending industry. During an earnings call last week, Jonathan Witter, the CEO of lender Sallie Mae, said that the company is \"excited about the opportunity created by the recent federal student lending reforms.\"\n\n\"These changes should reduce the likelihood of students and families taking on unsustainable levels of student debt,\" Witter said. \"These reforms also create the opportunity for us to help more students and families.\"\n\nTrump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation eliminates the Grad PLUS program, which allowed graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs. The legislation also imposes new borrowing caps for graduate and professional students: $20,500 for graduate students and $50,000 for professionals, such as those in medical or law school.\n\nWitter said the company expects those changes to bring in an estimated $5 billion in annual loan originations. Navient's CEO, David Yowan, expressed similar sentiment during the company's earnings call this month. He said that the changes to Grad PLUS are an \"opportunity\" for the company to expand, saying that \"there's a lot of room for growth\" this year.\n\nPrivate lenders have been anticipating these repayment changes for months. Yowan said during an August 2025 earnings call that eliminating the Grad PLUS program is \"a substantial and significant expansion of opportunities that we have with graduate students.\" SoFi's CEO Anthony Noto said at the time that the repayment changes could lead to \"further opportunities for in school lending and student loan refinance.\"\n\nWhile private lenders anticipate boosts to their businesses from Trump's repayment overhaul, some critics and borrowers are concerned. Borrowers could choose to forgo their programs entirely due to more limited federal financing, and if they turn to private lenders, they would lose out on federal debt relief and forgiveness.\n\nSara Partridge, associate director for higher education policy at the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress, previously told Business Insider that private student loans could also have higher interest rates than federal loans, leaving borrowers with more unaffordable debt.\n\n\"Private student loans often require a cosigner, so some students may not qualify, and they may have no options to fully finance and attend graduate school. So there is a possibility that for some students, this will be a barrier to accessing graduate school,\" Partridge said.\n\nStill, the Trump administration said the reforms are intended to curb excessive borrowing and increase accountability in the federal system.\n\n\"We are building a future where higher education works for everyone, where students are empowered to succeed, where taxpayers can trust that their investments will be used wisely, and where institutions are held accountable for delivering results,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a January statement.",

    "description": "Wix CEO Avishai Abrahami predicts 70% of the top 20 most popular jobs in the US will be affected by AI in the next five to 10 years.",
    "fullText": "What keeps the CEO of the billion-dollar company Wix up at night? The future of the workforce.\n\n\"I'm really worried about the employment market,\" Avishai Abrahami told Business Insider.\n\nThe CEO said that a \"massive amount\" of roles will shrink due to AI advancement. He predicted that roughly 70% of the top 20 most popular jobs in the US today will be affected by AI over the next five to 10 years.\n\nAbrahami said he's concerned about computers outsmarting humans, a concept often referred to as artificial general intelligence, which some tech leaders have said we have already surpassed in some ways. In that reality, humans \"become the monkeys,\" the CEO said. He said when he grew up, getting to such a point \"was a science-fiction thing,\" and it's now becoming a reality.\n\nAbrahami said he doesn't know whether that future is next week or 10 years from now — but he said it's closer than 15 or 20 years from now.\n\nHowever, AI will also create new opportunities and job types, Abrahami said. For example, Wix just introduced a new role called the xEngineer, described as a design-first engineer with deep domain expertise who uses AI as a key part of every workflow. The position is for a specialist who is \"amplified\" by AI, the company said in its announcement.\n\nAbrahami said some jobs are more at risk than others:\n\nAbrahami said one of the most common jobs in the US — driving for ride-share apps, taxi, and truck drivers — will be affected. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported more than 4 million of those jobs in 2024.\n\nAlphabet's Waymo has already launched self-driving services in multiple cities across the US, and Tesla just launched robotaxi rides without human oversight in Austin, where it has offered the service for several months.\n\nThe CEO said that people working in customer service or call center positions will also be affected. Other tech leaders, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, similarly said that AI will take customer service jobs first.\n\nOther roles, such as software developers and analysts, are already seeing AI reshape their jobs. A Google Cloud report released in September found that AI adoption had surged to 90% among software professionals.\n\nThe CEO predicted that jobs that require human performance or interaction will be a \"bit safer\" from job replacement. Abrahami said that \"nobody cares\" about robots running fast and competing against each other in soccer, and that athletes and other roles in the performing arts will stay.\n\nJobs that require high-level thinking are also performed better by humans than by AI right now with the current models, Abrahami said. The CEO said that AI isn't great at creating new things, and it's unlikely to invent a new science at its current level.\n\nAbrahami said that janitors are also \"probably really safe\" when it comes to replacement because the job requires a lot of handwork, which robots are far from being able to replicate.\n\n\"We are very good at processing visual movement information,\" Abrahami said.\n\nIn general, he said, jobs where humans can shine and bring something that's \"completely unexpected\" will be the areas where they're safe from replacement.",

    "title": "Snowmobiles, skis, and laser tag: How NATO soldiers train for Arctic assaults",
    "description": "Business Insider traveled north of the Arctic Circle to watch Finland's Jaeger Brigade train NATO forces on winter warfare and cold-weather survival.",
    "fullText": "SODANKYLÄ, Finland — Two soldiers moved cautiously through the snow-covered forest, their camouflage blending into the trees as their skis glided silently over the ground.\n\nSpotting an unaware enemy, they knelt and lined up a shot. Rifle fire erupted through the woods, the metallic smell of spent casings hanging in the cold air.\n\nA firefight kicked off, and a battle was underway.\n\nThe encounter took place during a recent winter combat exercise involving roughly 20 NATO troops, beginning with an assault on skis and snowmobiles before shifting into a simulated firefight using blanks and lasers instead of live ammo. The drill was part of a monthlong course led by Finland's Jaeger Brigade that trains allied forces in Arctic warfare and cold-weather survival.\n\nBusiness Insider observed the battle's start at a training site 75 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Finland's snow-blanketed Lapland region. It pitted a small platoon of NATO soldiers against an \"enemy\" force that was three times larger and composed of conscripts from the Jaeger Brigade.\n\nAs the strategic Arctic region becomes increasingly important to both NATO and its adversaries, exercises like this are designed to sharpen allied troops' abilities to fight on frozen battlefields. The environment is harsh and unforgiving, with sub-zero temperatures routine. And while fighting is simulated, it reflects real-world threats.\n\nMaj. Mikael Aikio, the Jaeger Brigade's Arctic section leader overseeing the course, told Business Insider that using lasers makes the training feel more realistic. \"At least there is some kind of fear of getting hit,\" he said.\n\nArctic security has become a focal point for NATO in recent years as Russia and China grow more active in the region, seeking to project power, establish new trade routes, and expand their access to natural resources.\n\nNATO leadership, concerned by certain Russian and Chinese behavior, has stressed the need for greater investment in collective Arctic defense to prevent Moscow and Beijing from gaining more military and economic influence in this strategic area.\n\nFinland — roughly a third of which sits above the Arctic Circle and has a long history of cold-weather combat — is well positioned to train Western forces in Arctic warfare and has led annual courses for more than a decade. That training has taken on new urgency for NATO.\n\nThe training Business Insider observed this week is ongoing, with participants hailing from Finland, the US, the UK, France, Italy, and Canada. The idea is that they can take what they learn in Lapland and use it to instruct or advise their units back home.\n\nThe course is divided into three phases over four weeks, starting with cold-weather survival and winter movement training, then teaching maneuvers such as attacking on skis and building snow foxholes, and ending with low-mountain activity above the tree line.\n\nThe second phase includes the combat exercise Business Insider had the opportunity to observe. The NATO platoon, known as the Blue force, began by crossing several kilometers of forest on snowmobiles before dismounting and skiing to the top of a small hill. Their objective was to effectively assault and capture territory defended by the Red force, the Finnish conscripts.\n\nManeuver in these environments used to be limited to skis, still a crucial tool for soldiers needing to traverse deep snow that otherwise would make ground assaults impossible. Modern snowmobiles lighten the load, allowing soldiers to travel farther faster with less overall effort, preserving energy for the fight.\n\n\"You can't get anywhere,\" said Aikio, the Jaeger Brigade major, said of the snow's effect on traditional assault elements. The Arctic demands some unique warfighting skills that aren't really used anywhere else.\n\nLearning to ski in these conditions can be challenging for soldiers, especially if they have no prior experience. They're also weighed down by cumbersome gear, such as packs, helmets, vests, and guns, making it more difficult.\n\n\"It's hard to move with the skis,\" said Finnish Lt. Laura Lähdekorpi, one of the soldiers in the winter warfare course. She told Business Insider that recreational downhill skiing has helped her to improve balance.\n\nCanadian Cpt. Vincent Lemelin, another soldier in the course, said he grew up skiing; however, the ones he's been using in Finland — long and designed to act as snowshoes — are very different from what he's used to.\n\n\"The fact that the skis are this long requires some adaptation, but it does give an advantage to already have the skills,\" Lemelin said.\n\n\"In this operating condition, even a good skier, at some point, especially at night, will start struggling because you're getting tired,\" he said. \"When you get tired, you're also less confident.\"\n\nThe assault began as daylight faded away. The Blue force used drones to collect targeting data, which it relayed to a nearby control van that then simulated artillery strikes against the Red force. Then the NATO troops advanced toward the Finns.\n\nSoldiers carried rifles loaded with blanks and equipped with transmitters that fire laser tracks when they pull the triggers. They wore vests and helmet straps able to detect any incoming laser signals.\n\nIf a shot found its mark, the vest on the opposing soldier announced to them that they had been \"killed\" or \"wounded,\" depending on where on the body they got hit by the laser. Then they took off their helmets to signal that they were out.\n\nThough the system resembles laser tag, troops take it seriously. It reflects the consequences of armed conflict, forcing soldiers to respond to simulated injuries and sudden losses, much like they would in real combat.\n\n\"If we fight without this, everyone can just walk straight into the woods,\" Lähdekorpi said. There'd be no way to tell if someone was hit or killed. This tech pushes soldiers to hide, move discreetly, and communicate more effectively.\n\nThe laser system isn't a perfect match for combat, Aikio acknowledged. \"If you have snow, or branches, or anything that's blocking the laser, it will not work. And that's not realistic, but it's much better than nothing.\"\n\nFor some NATO soldiers who come to these training exercises, it might be the first time they've operated in the harsh Arctic environment. Rising tensions between the West and Russia have fueled concerns that a future war between the two could unfold across frozen battlefields, making it critical that troops from Italy to the US are prepared for that possibility. A fight against China, another Arctic rival, could likewise involve Arctic activity.\n\nFinland shares an 800-mile-long border with Russia, is one of NATO's front-line countries, and has long been training for the possibility of renewed conflict in the Arctic, even before it joined the alliance in 2023. The Finns have fought the Russians before. It's been decades since the last round of hostilities, though.\n\n\"Now we are in NATO,\" Aikio said. \"We want to support our allies so that they can also fight and work here in our conditions — in our terrain.\"",

    "description": "Uber is teaming up with Waabi, an autonomous trucking outfit led by an Uber alum, to deploy robotaxis. Business Insider spoke with Waabi COO Lior Ron.",
    "fullText": "Uber has a new plan to get 25,000 robotaxis on the road — and it will come with the aid of some Uber alums and an autonomous trucking company.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ride-hailing giant announced a partnership with Waabi, a Canadian self-driving trucking startup founded by Raquel Urtasun. The partnership will include a $250 million investment from Uber, dependent on a set of milestones Waabi will have to achieve. The companies did not disclose what those were.\n\nThere are a few familiar faces here. Urtasun was the chief scientist at Uber's self-driving car division, Advanced Technologies Group. That division was sold in 2020 to Aurora Innovation, another autonomous trucking company and Waabi's competitor.\n\nWaabi's chief operating officer, Lior Ron, is also an Uber alum who founded and led the ride-hailing company's trucking business, Uber Freight.\n\n\"Uber has always been great in building marketplaces, in matching supply and demand, and in pricing,\" Ron told Business Insider. \"That's what created Uber, that what's created Uber Eats, and that's what I created with Uber Freight.\"\n\nAlphabet's Waymo and Amazon's Zoox are already on the ground providing unsupervised rides. Even in its core business, that is, autonomous trucking, Waabi has yet to deploy a fully driverless truck without safety drivers on commercial routes.\n\nThe startup didn't disclose a timeline or announce a partnership with an automaker that can deliver that many cars.\n\nHowever, Ron dismissed the first-mover advantage narrative.\n\n\"I think it's really about: Can the system scale? Can the system be mass-deployed?\" he said. \"It's not about getting the first driver out of the car or truck. It's not about the first lane. It's not about the first neighborhood.\"\n\nTrucking and ride-hailing are two different beasts. One has set routes and long stretches of highway driving; the other sees dense neighborhoods and unpredictable pedestrians.\n\nRon told Business Insider that Waabi has been building a generalizable AI \"brain\" that can be transferred to different vehicle platforms since \"day one.\"\n\n\"Nothing needs to be rebuilt,\" Ron said.\n\nIn addition, Ron said Waabi has built a sophisticated simulator that allows the AI driver to learn from an infinite number of scenarios that can’t easily be replicated in the real world.\n\nThe simulation allows for \"mixed reality testing\": An AI driver steering a truck or car is deployed on a closed course but responds to simulated events like a traffic jam or a lane-changing car that isn't really there.\n\nVideo from Waabi shows how a truck driving on a closed-course environment can slow down, reacting to a virtual traffic jam.\n\n\"Now we can test anything you can imagine — every permutation of traffic jam under the sun, every millions of different scenarios of construction zone,\" Ron said. \"A motorbike cutting you off — you can never do that because you'll be endangering the tester.\"",

    "fullText": "Diana Bahadori was better known online as Baby Rider, a 19-year-old Iranian motorbike influencer whose high-octane Instagram videos drew tens of thousands of followers. Her videos captured her precise cornering and fearless control of superbikes in a country where women riding motorcycles without a headscarf is illegal and often viewed as an act of defiance.\n\nAs of late January, global media reports and activist sources say Bahadori was killed by security forces during ongoing anti-government protests in northern Iran.\n\nAccording to independent Iranian news outlets such as IranWire, Bahadori was shot twice with live ammunition by Iranian security forces in the city of Gorgan around midnight on January 9. After her disappearance, her family searched for her for two days and only received her body on January 11.\n\nThe circumstances of her death have sparked outrage in Iran and among human rights advocates abroad.\n\nThe Iranian government and state media have offered conflicting explanations for what happened to Bahadori. Official statements circulated on her Instagram account claimed she died in a motorbike accident and urged followers not to spread rumors about her death.\n\nIndependent sources, however, say that her family was pressured by intelligence and security agencies to publicly deny responsibility by government forces as a condition of getting her body back. Reports allege that her burial was carried out quietly and without public acknowledgement because of those pressures.\n\nWhat has made this case especially compelling for international audiences is the way it encapsulates the intersecting forces at play in Iran’s current turmoil. The protests first began in late December, triggered by a rapid collapse of the Iranian rial and deepening economic distress.\n\nThey quickly expanded into a simmering revolt against the policies and leadership of Iran’s Supreme Leader and the country’s clerical establishment. Women’s rights, personal freedoms, strict moral codes, and broader political repression have all turned into rallying points for demonstrators across the nation.\n\nBahadori represented a generation of young Iranians pushing up against the boundaries of what is socially and legally acceptable in their society. She had amassed more than 100,000 followers on Instagram by showcasing her riding skills and a kind of vibrant modern lifestyle that many young Iranians find inspiring.\n\nIn a society with strict codes on dress, movement, and gender, a woman confidently riding a powerful motorbike was inherently symbolic.\n\nSocial media activists and diaspora Iranian journalists have invoked Bahadori’s story in the same tradition as earlier cases of young Iranians killed during uprisings. In 2009, the killing of Neda Agha-Soltan by militia forces during protests became a defining moment widely shared on the internet and broadcast abroad.\n\nLook at this beautiful girl. She was full of love and joy for life.\nEven with all the restrictions and bans in Iran, she broke the rules and followed her passion. A strong, fearless young woman who went against the Islamic Republic’s laws that say women can’t ride motorcycles,… pic.twitter.com/fLsGPr0PeF\n\n— Masih Alinejad 🏳️ (@AlinejadMasih) January 26, 2026\n\nHer death galvanized international attention and helped shape the narrative of the Green Movement. Other protest deaths in recent years have similarly sparked anger over state violence and information control.\n\nIranian activist Masih Alinejad took to social media to condemn the treatment of Bahadori, saying the young woman’s only crime was being born under a regime that cannot tolerate the very image of youthful independence.\n\nLook at this beautiful girl, Alinejad wrote. She was full of love and joy for life. Even with all the restrictions and bans in Iran, she broke the rules and followed her passion.\n\nIt remains difficult to independently verify precise details from inside Iran because of restricted press access and government censorship. Independent journalists and human rights groups rely on family accounts, activist networks, and digital communication channels to piece together events that may otherwise go unreported.\n\nNonetheless, international coverage and reporting from outlets like IranWire and multiple global news services have repeatedly cited the core elements of Bahadori’s death.\n\nFor many observers, the loss of Baby Rider is tragic, and a stark reminder of the costs borne by young people in societies marked by political repression and generational conflict. It raises urgent questions about how authoritarian governments respond when a youthful challenge to cultural norms meets fierce political dissent.",

    "fullText": "At a family gathering over Christmas, I took on my 76-year-old mother once again at virtual bowling. Could I finally best her?\n\nMy mother bore me. My mother nurtured me. My mother educated me. She has a resilience unmatched, a love all-forgiving. She is the glue that holds our family together. But right now, I am kicking her ass at video game bowling, and it feels good!\n\nIn the 00s, my mum was the best Wii Bowling player in the world. She was unbeatable. Strike after strike after strike. The Dudette in our family’s Big Lebowski. So when she said she was coming to visit us in Canada, I thought the time was right to buy the updated Nintendo Switch Sports version of her favourite game. She’s 76 now, and I might finally have a chance of beating her, I thought, especially if I allowed myself a cheeky tune-up on the game before she arrived.\n\nI fire up Nintendo Switch Sports to get the lay of the land. Tennis and golf have survived the almost 20 years since Wii Sports, along with bowling. The tennis has nothing to keep me entertained for longer than 10 minutes, and I have been terrified of any golf game where you swing a controller since Christmas morning 2009, when my wife surprised me with Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf for the Wii and I surprised her by throwing my back out after a six-hour session on it.\n\nVolleyball and badminton are a double serving of meh. Little kids might find them fun, but not this big one. Basketball has been carried over from Wii Sports Resort, and Chambara is an updated version of fencing. The latter is every bit as chaotic as the original, the former is still a car crash: the hand motion that you have to use to move and dribble is one that I haven’t vigorously practised since I was a teenager. And I don’t want to do it in front of my mother.\n\nIf basketball is a fender-bender, then the new football game is a multi-car pileup. It’s a slower, less entertaining version of Rocket League, but one that allows you to strap a controller to your leg to virtually kick the ball. There is no way a 56-year-old man should try to kick something that doesn’t exist. You may as well take a pair of scissors to your hamstrings.\n\nHowever, just like Wii Sports before it, Switch Sports is worth every penny because of the bowling.\n\nIt is the very essence of gaming fun and simplicity, which is great because we were all drunk when we had our first session. Three generations of Diamond family silliness. It was beautiful.\n\nMum wasn’t without criticisms of the new version. The updated Mii characters are too realistic; she preferred the quasi-abstract shape of the Wii originals. And she is deflated that the Switch just says “spare” rather than “NICE SPARE!”\n\nHer biggest criticism is the size of the Joy-Con controllers compared with the Wii remote.\n\n“I am happier with something bigger in my hands,” she cackles.\n\nShe is incorrigible. I know where I get it from.\n\nThe next day it was just my mum and I, playing sober. It was a very different kind of gaming, social and laid-back; we talked about how she fell in love with this game during a Christmas at my house back in 2006. My brother was there, with his kids, and my sister-in-law was visiting from Canada. I have zero recollection of this, so thank goodness I have an elderly mother to help me remember things in my dotage.\n\nShe loved it so much that when she returned home, she immediately bought her own Wii. It lives and breathes to this day, with all the plastic adornments you got with Wii Sports – the one and only game she has ever played on it.\n\nIntroducing her to her favourite game feels like a repayment, because my mum was the one who got me into gaming. She had gone back to school to train as a word processing teacher in the 80s and had an interest in programming, so she bought a ZX Spectrum to learn BASIC – but she never had a chance, as us kids hijacked the machine to go Manic Mining. Yup. Our Atic Atac addiction stopped our mum from essentially becoming Brenda Romero.\n\nMum claims she introduced me to the “game” that changed my life. Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing. She has a point. I type crazy fast, because of Mavis. We reminisce about the last-minute calls to her theatre school when we were short of audience members for GamesMaster, and the joy she felt when I got athletes to wave hello to her on the telly.\n\nI wouldn’t have the life I have had without her.\n\nI hope that my kids get me over for a games night when I am 76, so they can finally best me at Street Fighter II, when my arthritic thumbs can no longer pull off a Dragon Punch. And then I hope that their kids do that with them, and this glorious circle of gaming life continues.\n\nI am so happy to have this time with her to play games again. But I’m even happier for the space we fill around the game, the memories we continue to create. A week after she left, I booted up bowling again, but I only played for 10 minutes before I switched it off. It just wasn’t the same without Mum.",

    "fullText": "The Institute for Public Policy Research also argues that tech companies must pay publishers for content they use\n\nAI-generated news should carry “nutrition” labels and tech companies must pay publishers for the content they use, according to a left-of-centre thinktank, amid rising use of the technology as a source for current affairs.\n\nThe Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said AI firms were rapidly emerging as the new “gatekeepers” of the internet and intervention was needed to create a healthy AI news environment.\n\nIt recommended standardised labels for AI-generated news, showing what information had been used to create those answers, including peer-reviewed studies and articles from professional news organisations. It also urged the establishment of a licensing regime in the UK allowing publishers to negotiate with tech companies over the use of their content in AI news.\n\n“If AI companies are going to profit from journalism and shape what the public sees, they must be required to pay fairly for the news they use and operate under clear rules that protect plurality, trust and the long-term future of independent journalism,” said Roa Powell, senior research fellow at IPPR and the report’s co-author.\n\nThe IPPR said work on licensing could begin with the UK’s competition regulator using its new enforcement powers over Google. The Competition and Markets Authority this week proposed giving web publishers and news organisations the power to stop Google scraping their content for its overviews. Collective licensing deals would ensure a wide range of publishers were included, the IPPR added.\n\nGoogle’s AI overviews now reach 2 billion users a month and approximately a quarter of people use AI to get information, according to the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.\n\n“With the right policies in place, the government can shape this market so that UK news organisations transition their business models for the AI age and AI companies improve the reliability of their products by drawing on trusted sources,” said the report.\n\nIPPR tested four AI tools – ChatGPT, Google AI overviews, Google Gemini and Perplexity – by entering 100 news-related queries into those platforms and analysing more than 2,500 links produced by the AI responses.\n\nChatGPT and Gemini did not cite journalism by the BBC, which has blocked the bots they use to assemble answers, while overviews and Perplexity used BBC content despite the broadcaster’s objections to those tools using its journalism.\n\nThe IPPR found the Telegraph, GB News, the Sun and the Daily Mail were cited in fewer than 4% of answers on ChatGPT, while the Guardian – which has a licensing deal with ChatGPT’s parent, OpenAI – was used as a source in nearly six out of 10 responses. The Financial Times, which also has a licensing deal with OpenAI, also featured highly. The Guardian was also the most common source used by Gemini, appearing in half of all answers.\n\nGoogle’s use of AI summaries at the top of search results has affected click-through traffic for publishers, with a knock-on effect for their revenues, because many users read the overview without moving on to the original journalism.\n\nThe IPPR said questions needed to be asked about how financial relationships between AI companies and news providers shaped answers.\n\n“If licensed publications appear more prominently in AI answers, there is a risk of locking out smaller and local news providers, who are less likely to get AI deals,” the report said.\n\nIPPR added that while licensing deals could replace lost advertising revenues to an extent, they would not maintain a healthy news ecosystem. They could make news organisations dependent on tech giants for revenue and that income could easily disappear if copyright protections are weakened, said the thinktank.\n\nThe IPPR said there should be public funding to create new business models for investigative news and local news, whose sustainability could be threatened by the rise of AI news, and for the BBC to “innovate with AI”.",

Extreme cold followed the snow, with state record lows set that are still on the books today in Alabama and Mississippi. New Market, Alabama, hit 27 degrees below zero on Jan. 30, while Corinth, Mississippi, fell to 19 below zero.\n\nImmense lake-effect snowfall fell near Oswego, New York, during and after the storm, where a total of 103 inches was measured. At Camden, 50 inches of snow fell, setting New York's all-time 24-hour snowfall record, which is still on the books today. Schools in Oswego were closed for a week. Bulldozers had to be used to remove snow, with helicopters flying in supplies and medical help.\n\nEvery major city from Maryland to New York got more than a foot of snow from the storm:\n\n• Pittsburgh, PA: 14.4 inches\n• Washington, DC: 13.8 inches\n• Allentown, PA: 13.3 inches\n• Philadelphia, PA: 12.7 inches\n• Baltimore, MD: 12.1 inches\n\nAn estimated 201 people were killed from heart attacks while shoveling snow, traffic accidents, cold or in fires started by people trying to heat their homes.\n\nWhile this storm went down in the history books as the Blizzard of 1966, it should not be confused with the deadly March blizzard in the Northern Plains, which is sometimes referred to by the same name.",

    "fullText": "If you have listened to any of Arne Slot's news conferences this season, you will have heard the Liverpool manager refer to 'low blocks'.\n\nThe term essentially refers to a team's defensive shape - blocking space close to their own goal. The closer to their goal, the lower the block.\n\nSlot's side - who cruised to the Premier League title last season in his first year in charge - have struggled for fluidity and consistency this term.\n\nAnd one of the reasons for that, according to the Reds boss, has been their inability to break down sides who defend deep against them.\n\nBut Slot's mentions of low blocks have become so frequent that frustration has started to grow among fans.\n\nLiverpool legend Steven Gerrard said: \"He needs to stop mentioning low blocks. Low blocks have been happening against Liverpool since I was playing. That's just the way it is.\"\n\nHowever, Slot may have a point - with the Reds having faced the highest percentage of low blocks of any top-flight team this season - making up 26% of defensive tactics used against them.\n\nIn fact, the space Slot's side thrived in last year only seems to present itself against European sides in the Champions League, with Liverpool having scored nine goals - and conceded none - in their past two games in Europe.\n\nSo why are the Reds struggling against low blocks domestically, how are they trying to unlock them and what could they do better?",

We have something to cherish being here. We've got life. It's not about trying to be a thug in the streets.\"\n\nDuring the face-off, Stevenson continued chatting to Lopez, who kept a straight face and simply stared at him, before Stevenson delivered a light shoulder barge and walked off stage.",

Musk turned on Starlink service over Ukraine in 2022 ‍after Kyiv pleaded for help in the first days following Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\nDespite Musk's subsequent clashes with Ukrainian officials over his views on the war, Ukraine's military still relies on tens of thousands of Starlinks for battlefield communication and for piloting ​some drone missions.\n\nThey are favoured for their stable connection on the battlefield and for their resistance to ‌enemy signal jamming.\n\nIn a social media post in February 2024, SpaceX said it does not sell or ship Starlink to Russia, and \"does not do business of any kind with the Russian Government or its military\".\n\nThe U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War said it had seen reports of Russia using Starlink-equipped Shahed long-range drones beginning in September 2024.\n\n'HUNDREDS' OF STARLINK-EQUIPPED DRONES\n\nSerhiy Beskrestnov, a newly appointed adviser to Fedorov, drew attention to the issue ⁠over the past week by posting pictures on social media ​of the wreckage of long-range Russian drones, including Shaheds, with Starlink ​terminals.\n\nOn Tuesday, Beskrestnov said that Shahed drones manually flown by pilots, possibly through Starlink, had attacked a passenger train in northeastern Ukraine. That attack killed five people, and was denounced ‍by Kyiv as an act ⁠of terrorism.\n\nOn Thursday, Beskrestnov said there had been \"hundreds\" of cases where Starlink-enabled Russian drones had attacked Ukraine.\n\n\"The complexity of this process lies in the fact that Starlink cannot be suppressed by means of ⁠electronic warfare, and even their position in flight cannot be detected by reconnaissance equipment,\" he wrote, adding that the way to solve ‌the issue was therefore through SpaceX.",

    "description": "Julia Buckley tells PEOPLE she was stopped at the airport when officials couldn’t verify her identity, repeatedly citing her eyes as the issue",
    "fullText": "A routine trip home took a shocking turn when Julia Buckley was suddenly pulled aside at the airport\n\nOfficials insisted something about her passport photo didn’t add up — even as she tried to explain what had changed\n\nHer TikTok recounting the moment sparked a viral debate, with travelers sharing similar experiences\n\nWhat was supposed to be a routine trip home from Cabo turned into a travel nightmare when one woman says she was detained at the airport because officials didn’t believe her passport photo matched her face.\n\nJulia Buckley tells PEOPLE she was returning to San Diego through the CBX crossing after flying into Tijuana when things suddenly went wrong at customs.\n\nAs she walked through the checkpoint, officers scanned her passport and attempted to take a live photo to verify her identity. Buckley says they took her picture five times, but the system still couldn’t confirm it was her.\n\nBefore she fully understood what was happening, she was asked to follow an airport worker into a separate area. She recalls being led into a locked glass room where other travelers were being held, unable to reach her fiancé or use her phone.\n\n“There were handcuffs on the chairs, but I was not handcuffed,” Buckley says, describing the unsettling environment. She adds that she could see her fiancé nearby, but officials would not allow him to wait with her.\n\nBuckley says officers began questioning her repeatedly, asking the same series of personal questions over multiple rounds. During the process, her passport was scanned again and again as officials continued trying to take photos that would match the image on file.\n\nAfter more than 20 attempts, Buckley learned what the officers believed was the issue. “They said my eyes were different,” she says, still shocked by the explanation.\n\nShe tried to point out the obvious changes that had occurred since her passport photo was taken at 18. Now 29, Buckley says she has different hair, different brows and has simply grown from a teenager into an adult.\n\nStill, the officials insisted none of those factors mattered. “They kept telling me it wasn’t any of those things, but it was my eyes,” she says, explaining that they claimed her eyes looked more open in the older photo.\n\nThe experience quickly became emotionally overwhelming, even though she knew she had done nothing wrong. Buckley says the unfamiliar setting made her \"really nervous,\" and she blanked on basic details like previous addresses.\n\n“It was about 40 minutes,” she says of the detention, admitting she felt shaken sitting near other detained travelers. She describes feeling more frightened by the situation itself than by the questioning.\n\nBuckley says she attempted to provide other forms of identification, including her driver’s license, but officials refused to look at anything beyond her passport.\n\nDespite the stress, she says the officers were not cruel or aggressive. “No one was mean,” Buckley explains, adding that she believes they were simply unable to release her until the computer verification worked.\n\nEventually, the doors were unlocked. Buckley recalls officials simply telling her she was free to go, leaving her with no paperwork or guidance for future travel.\n\nWhen she posted the story on TikTok, she expected only her friends to laugh along. Instead, the video went viral, sparking widespread debate about whether her passport photo truly resembled her.\n\n“Half of the people don’t think the picture is me, and the other half think it is,” she says. Buckley also heard from others who had faced similar detentions after weight loss, illness or medical treatment.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nWith another Mexico trip approaching, Buckley knew she couldn’t risk a repeat situation. After reading advice in her comments, she was able to secure a new passport within two weeks and says her most recent trip went smoothly.\n\nNow, she hopes her experience serves as a warning for other travelers. “If you’ve made drastic changes or aged a decent amount, get a new photo,” Buckley says. “It’s not worth it.”\n\nPEOPLE has reached out to CBP for comment.",

He certainly has not only that - he has a certain charisma as well and personality that he doesn't get overwhelmed, whether it's by the situation, or the stadium or the opposition, and that's a huge quality to have.\"\n\nDowman, who joined the Arsenal academy when he was eight, added: \"I've been at the club my whole life, so this really means a lot.\n\n\"There's such a clear pathway here, players who have come through our academy, like Bukayo Saka, Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri, who all really inspire me.\n\n\"It's amazing to have role models so close that have experienced the same thing that I have.\"\n\nDowman's contract will see him become a scholar from the summer before transitioning to a professional deal.\n\nAt 15 years and 234 days, Dowman became the second-youngest player to represent the Gunners and the second-youngest to play in the Premier League - with team-mate Nwaneri, currently on loan at Marseille, holding both records.\n\nIn November, he became the youngest player to feature in a Champions League game when he made a substitute appearance in the 3-0 win at Slavia Prague.\n\nDowman has made five senior appearances this season but has spent a period out with an ankle injury.",

    "title": "Donald Trump Skips Over Kristi Noem During Cabinet Meeting After She's Sidelined from Minneapolis ICE Operation",
    "description": "Noem's actions as homeland security secretary have been under fire following recent incidents with federal immigration agents",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump skipped over Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a Jan. 29 Cabinet meeting\n\nTrump also made the rare move of refusing questions from the press following the meeting\n\nKaitlan Collins, CNN's chief White House correspondent, suggested that Trump's actions allowed the administration to avoid addressing recent DHS controversies from Minneapolis and heightened scrutiny about Noem's leadership\n\nPresident Donald Trump added more fuel to the rumors about Kristi Noem's job security during a Cabinet meeting on Thursday, Jan. 29.\n\nTrump's televised Cabinet meetings — where his top advisers take turns updating him on their departments' priorities — have become opportunities to tout the administration's achievements and comment on current events, however two notable actions by Trump prevented that from happening on Thursday, as many wondered how he would acknowledge the ongoing criticism toward the Department of Homeland Security and its controversial presence in Minnesota.\n\nThe federal immigration operation in Minneapolis has been a source of great backlash for the Trump administration, including with the fatal officer-involved shootings of American citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti; distressing updates about 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos, whose ICE detainment while returning home from preschool with his father went viral; and the recent attack on Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar while she was condemning DHS Secretary Noem at a town hall.\n\nWhile Trump called on many members of his Cabinet for updates on issues like housing, the economy, the ongoing situation in Venezuela and more during Thursday's meeting, CNN chief White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins was quick to note afterward that he skipped over Noem, preventing her from addressing the criticism surrounding her leadership of federal immigration agencies.\n\nTrump also ended the meeting abruptly and, in an exceedingly rare move for the 47th president, declined to take questions from the assembled members of the White House press corps.\n\n\"There have been a ton of headlines generated around Minneapolis, what's happening there, especially with the president changing his leadership there on the ground,\" Collins said on the air immediately after the event. \"That did not come up at all during this Cabinet meeting, and we were there for over an hour and a half.\"\n\n\"Not once was Minneapolis brought up, and obviously no questions were brought up to the president because he did not take questions, despite talking during the Cabinet meeting about how he believes they are the most transparent administration ever,\" she added.\n\nNoem and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino both came under fire for comments made shortly after Pretti's death on Jan. 24, in which they labeled the 37-year-old ICU nurse a \"domestic terrorist.\"\n\n\"This individual who came with weapons and ammunition to stop a law enforcement operation of federal law enforcement officers committed an act of domestic terrorism,\" Noem said while speaking with reporters just hours after Pretti was shot and killed. \"That’s the facts.\"\n\nVideo footage soon revealed that Pretti was holding a cell phone, not a gun, and that Border Patrol agents disarmed him before shooting him at point-blank range.\n\nCalls for Noem's impeachment have come from both Republicans and Democrats; however, when asked on Jan. 27 if Noem would be stepping down, Trump answered simply, telling reporters, \"No.\"\n\nHe has, however, sidelined Noem and Bovino from the operation in Minneapolis. In a Jan. 26 Truth Social post, Trump announced that he was sending his \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, to be his new point person on the ground in the embattled city.\n\n\"I am sending Tom Homan to Minnesota tonight,\" Trump, 79, wrote. \"He has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there. Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me.\"\n\nThe following day, The Atlantic reported that Bovino will return to his Border Patrol post in El Centro, Calif., where he is Commander Op At Large of that sector.\n\nCBS News also reported on Jan. 27 that Noem is unlikely to lose her Cabinet position outright, but is expected to shift her focus away from Minneapolis to \"securing the southern border and other priorities.\"\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nOn Jan. 27, Axios reported that Noem was mounting a defense amid the growing scrutiny, reportedly placing the blame for any DHS missteps on Trump and his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller.\n\n\"Everything I've done, I've done at the direction of the president and Stephen,\" Noem reportedly said, according to a person who relayed the quote to Axios.",

The way you pushed me back into the match on every point is crazy.\"\n\nVictory keeps alive the 22-year-old's bid to write more tennis history - should he win on Sunday, he will become the youngest man to complete the career Grand Slam.\n\nOnly Novak Djokovic - and Alcaraz's own physical condition - now stand in the way of a fourth successive Grand Slam final between the Spaniard and Jannik Sinner.\n\nSerb Djokovic, bidding for a record 25th major singles title, faces world number two Sinner later on Friday.",

    "fullText": "A serious health threat has been spreading in Pennsylvania, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and shifting weather patterns may be a contributing factor.\n\nCases of anaplasmosis went up over 50% in Allegheny County in 2025. U.S. states, including Wisconsin and California, have also seen jumps in the tick-borne bacterial infection.\n\nAnaplasmosis is routinely transmitted alongside Lyme disease via tick bites. Initial symptoms of infection include fever, fatigue, and nausea. When left untreated, it can have longer-term consequences.\n\n\"I really can't commit a lot to doing what I used to,\" Janine Hauck told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in late December. Hauck contracted anaplasmosis in 2019 and has since suffered from chronic fatigue, impacting her ability to hike, bike, swim, and engage in the outdoor activities she loves. \"It's changed my life.\"\n\nA major contributor to the increase in anaplasmosis infections is the expanded population and habitat of disease-carrying ticks. Warmer, wetter weather patterns, exacerbated in part by atmospheric pollution, have provided prime conditions for ticks to reproduce.\n\nThis phenomenon has exacerbated the spread of other vector-borne illnesses, including dengue virus and West Nile virus.\n\nAnaplasmosis can be treated with antibiotics if detected early. For this reason, officials recommend regularly checking for tick bites after spending time outdoors. Seeking medical attention soon after a tick bite can help support recovery.\n\nPreventing tick bites in the first place is possible by wearing adequately long clothing and using effective repellents. Hauck told the Post-Gazette that the precautions are worth the hassle.\n\n\"People don't get how bad a tick bite could affect your life,\" she told the paper. \"I probably spent over $60,000 trying to get better. I'm lucky I have [the money], but not everyone does.\"\n\nIn the big picture, attacking the root of the problem may also require reducing emissions as much as possible in order to mitigate increasingly warm, wet weather and to shrink tick habitats and activity.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "When markets are volatile and clouded by uncertainty, investors look for stability. And you can find that stability in dividend stocks, especially Dividend Kings, which have a track record of paying and increasing dividends consistently for more than 50 years. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), of the world’s largest and most diversified health care companies, is one such Dividend King.\n\nAlthough J&J is not a high-flying growth stock, it quietly outpaced the market last year. JNJ stock soared 43.7%, compared to the market’s overall gain of 16.6%. One month into 2026, the stock is up more than 10%, surpassing the S&P 500 Index ($SPX).\n\nMore Layoffs Are Coming at Citigroup in March. What Does That Mean for C Stock and Its 2% Dividend?\n\nThis High-Yield Dividend Stock Is in Turbulent Water. Is the 6%+ Payout Worth It?\n\nGet exclusive insights with the FREE Barchart Brief newsletter. \n\nJ&J’s recent fourth-quarter results reveal why you should buy and hold this dividend stock if you don't already.\n\nIn 2023, Johnson & Johnson made a bold decision to spin off its consumer division — which was comprised of well-known, everyday brands such as Tylenol, Listerine, Neutrogena, and others — into a separate company called Kenvue (KVUE). The goal was to establish a pure-play health care innovation business concentrated solely on drugs and medical devices. This decision has worked well. Its business today operates in two major segments:\n\nInnovative Medicine (Pharmaceuticals) focuses on the development of prescription drugs in oncology, immunology, neurology, and cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases.\n\nMedTech (Medical Devices) refers to medical technologies utilized by hospitals and surgeons.\n\nThe Innovative Medicine segment generates the majority of J&J’s revenue and drives most of its growth. In the fourth quarter, the segment generated $15.7 billion in revenue, an increase of 10% year-over-year. For the full year, the segment revenue increased by 6% to $60.4 billion. The company reported a 5.3% increase in worldwide sales of $94.2 billion, despite a significant headwind from the loss of exclusivity on Stelara. Adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 8.1% year over year to $10.79.\n\nWith 21% operational sales growth in 2025 and projected annual sales of over $50 billion by 2030, oncology continues to be one of the company's biggest growth engines. Meanwhile, the MedTech segment’s revenue grew 7.5% in Q4 and 6.1% for the full year, generating $34 billion in sales, driven by Cardiovascular, Surgery, and Vision. With over 60 active clinical trials and multiple regulatory submissions planned, MedTech continues to provide a second major growth pillar alongside Pharmaceuticals.",

But JD Vance’s attack and insult of my colleague, Tammy Duckworth, is low and beneath the dignity of a Vice President,” Durbin said in a post on social platform X.\n\n“Senator Duckworth has never backed away from a fight, even with a Vice President. She has fought for and won a seat in the Senate where she fights for veterans, those with disabilities, and the people of our state,” Durbin added, lauding his fellow Prairie State senator.\n\n“J.D. Vance should focus on repairing the chaos his President has created, not on a Senator who has earned the respect of the Senate for her courage and effectiveness.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Duckworth slammed Vance after the vice president bashed her line of questioning at a Senate hearing. He compared her to the fictional character Forrest Gump, who was portrayed as having a physical and intellectual disability.\n\n“Forrest Gump ran toward danger in Vietnam. Your boss ran to his podiatrist crying bone spurs,” Duckworth wrote on X, noting President Trump’s medical draft deferments.\n\n“Petty insults at the expense of people with disabilities won’t change the fact that you’re risking troops’ lives to boost Chevron’s stock price,” she added. “It’s my job to hold you accountable.”\n\nVance had posted earlier on X, “Watching Tammy Duckworth obsessively interrupt Marco Rubio during this hearing is like watching Forest Gump argue with Isaac Newton.”\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Vance’s office for comment.",

    "fullText": "(Corrects to clarify remarks by official in paragraph 23)\n\nVERBIER, Switzerland, Jan 29 (Reuters) - A New Year fire that killed 40 people at a Swiss ski resort bar has shaken a lucrative tourism industry that long had an impeccable reputation and has piled pressure on the country to tighten safety standards.\n\nNews ​that \"Le Constellation\" bar, in the town of Crans-Montana in Canton Valais, had gone six years without a safety check quickly prompted officials to ban some practices, including the ‌use of sparkling candles blamed for the tragedy.\n\nThe stain on Switzerland's otherwise exemplary safety record was quickly felt as local hoteliers reported cancelled bookings in a canton where the cost of real estate in resorts such as nearby Verbier ‌can fetch prices on a par with Hong Kong.\n\n\"There were cancellations, there were reservation postponements to later dates in hotels,\" said Bruno Huggler, director of the Crans-Montana tourism office, after the blaze that killed mostly teenagers and injured more than 100 people.\n\nLe Constellation owners Jacques Moretti and his wife are under investigation for negligent homicide and other crimes.\n\nThe disaster has ignited a fractious political debate over safety, including calls for harmonised national standards in a country that prizes local autonomy.\n\nIt has also sparked alarm in Verbier's hospitality sector.\n\n\"We realize this could very well happen right here,\" said Lionel Dubois, head ⁠of Verbier's Association of Hoteliers, Cafe Owners and Restaurateurs. \"That, I think, ‌is a bit frightening.\"\n\nTourism in Switzerland was worth about $22.17 billion, or 3% of national output in 2021, official data showed.\n\nWhile bookings at Crans-Montana's roughly 1,300 hotel rooms have suffered, the overall picture is stable, as chalet and apartment rentals cover most stays, tourism boss Huggler said.\n\nYoung people have been ‍shaken, though, and while some restaurants are returning to life, bars remain quieter, said Cedric Berger, head of the Association of Apartment and Chalet Owners of the Crans-Montana Upper Plateau.\n\nSome local accommodation providers have seen cancellations in short-term vacation rentals.\n\n\"January is a month to forget, a lost month for everyone,\" said Berger.\n\nSurvivors of the fire, which also killed French and Italian citizens, are still hospitalised around Europe.\n\nCrans-Montana apartment owners from Italy ​and France are angry, said Berger, who is also a lawyer.\n\n\"People go to Valais not because it's the 'best party', but because it's Switzerland, and you think it's safe. If that quality ‌disappears, then Switzerland's 'fortress' is a bit shaken,\" he added.\n\nAnxiety about the fallout is palpable in Verbier, where Reuters contacted 37 hospitality venues.\n\nMost declined to speak or did not reply, though the 12 who did said checks were conducted properly. But all agreed that rules must be reinforced to guarantee regular inspections, limit numbers at venues and provide fire-safety training to staff.\n\nIn four of Switzerland's 26 cantons, including Valais, building insurance is not mandatory - potentially increasing risks for owners hit by fire, as well as weakening controls.\n\nThe Swiss Insurance Association said over 90% of buildings in Switzerland are insured according to market estimates, adding it does not keep precise figures on how many are not. Reuters could not establish if Le Constellation had building insurance.\n\nThe fire generated the ⁠biggest media storm around Switzerland since the 2023 collapse of Credit Suisse bank, said Alexandre Edelmann, head of ​Presence Switzerland, the foreign ministry unit that promotes the country's image abroad.\n\nAs media reports about Switzerland jumped to 25 ​times more than average in early January, a crisis room was established to support people abroad following the fire, said Edelmann.\n\nLawmaker Jacqueline de Quattro, head of the lower house of parliament security committee, said the fire had exposed potential shortcomings in Switzerland's federal system, which allows cantons to set their own ‍rules.\n\n\"We believed we had strict rules and that Switzerland ⁠was well‑prepared,\" said de Quattro. \"But then we were brutally confronted with reality.\"\n\nProposing a national review to harmonise standards backed by an events industry group, she voiced concerns over event professionals' reports of sloppy work stemming from inadequate training, cost pressures and irregular inspections.\n\nBut the head of Verbier's Val de Bagnes municipality, Fabien Sauthier, said inspections need resources ⁠and that, while regular checks occur, it was tough to inspect some 400 public buildings annually with just four full-time safety officials.\n\nAnd any push towards greater federal oversight could face resistance.\n\n\"I'm a Swiss person, so I think the canton ‌should decide what it wants to do,\" said Willy Schranz, head of the municipal council in Adelboden in Canton Bern. \"If you take responsibility, then it's a ‌very good system.\"",

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide this response,” read a statement from Gonzalez who noted she voluntarily recused herself from hearings regarding unaccompanied migrant children’s cases.\n\nOn Dec. 17, 2025, attorneys from Estrella del Paso – an immigrant advocacy organization – filed a motion to recuse Gonzalez from hearings involving unaccompanied migrant children – children entering the U.S. illegally and without a parent or guardian.\n\nIn the court filing, attorneys and social services workers with the organization submitted written declarations detailing allegations that Gonzalez showed a “pattern and practice of cruelty” towards migrant children during the hearings.\n\nThe declarations made allegations that Gonzalez would subject children to humiliating interrogations about why they left their country, and that on multiple occasions she shamed the children for abandoning their parents.\n\nIn one account an attorney alleged that Gonzalez interrogated a 17-year-old Guatemalan boy who testified that he fled his country to Mexico from an abusive alcoholic father, but that he was kidnapped and beat up twice while in Mexico. The attorney alleged that in response, Gonzalez “harangued” the boy: “Why didn’t you stay in another part of Mexico? It’s beautiful, and it’s big. Why didn’t you stay in another part of Mexico?” the document read.\n\nIn another hearing involving a 16-year old Venezuelan girl from Venezuela who had been a victim of child prostitution, an attorney alleged that Gonzalez scolded the child “not to engage in prostitution.”\n\nThe filing went on to note that despite these alleged practices by Gonzalez, she would “unexpectedly” grant children their petitions seeking Special Immigrant Juvenile Visas, but that she recently began denying the petitions without providing any reasoning in 2025.\n\nEstrella del Paso declined an interview request with KTSM and instead offered the following statement:\n\n“For nearly 40 years, Estrella del Paso has provided legal representation and other legal services to immigrants in El Paso. We are a non-profit law firm. As attorneys, we take our legal and ethical duties to our clients very seriously, and we file every motion and document with the court with these duties in mind.

We will not comment on the motions or our interactions with the court. All our clients are owed a duty of confidentiality, and we will not violate this duty, especially in the case of vulnerable children.”\n\nGonzalez’s current term runs through 2028.",

    "fullText": "EVANSVILLE, Ind. (WEHT) — Despite a program first from star guard Camryn Runner, the University of Evansville women’s basketball team couldn’t outlast Belmont in overtime.\n\nThe Purple Aces had the Bruins’ back against the wall late in the fourth quarter with a five point lead following a three-pointer by Sydney Huber. But three costly turnovers and missed free throws helped Belmont send the game into overtime tied at 59.\n\nIn OT, UE got on the board first, but foul trouble put the game in the Bruins’ hands. Belmont shot a total of 16 free throws in the full five minutes of overtime outscoring the Purple Aces in the quarter by six. Evansville dropped the game 79-73.\n\n“There’s no question that some losses hurt worse than others,” said head coach Robyn Scherr. “And you know if I had to choose between two types of losses, I’d take this one over getting beat by 20. So you know again I think we’re proving a lot to ourselves right now about who we can compete with. And so you know there was a ton of positives in this game to take from, and then there are things we’re going to learn from too and hopefully clean up. And hopefully that’ll help us down the road.”\n\nRunner recorded the first triple-double in program history with 19 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists. While Georgia Cox continued her recent strong play, scoring a career high 23 points to go along with four assists. Huber knocked down three three-pointers to round out the group with 11 points. Worth noting star guard Logan Luebbers Palmer missed her third straight game.\n\nEvansville will be back in action Sunday, February 1st, against Indiana State in Meeks Family Fieldhouse at 3 p.m. The game is set to stream on ESPN Plus.",

    "description": "Here's what Penny Hardaway said after Memphis basketball beat FAU on Jan. 29.",
    "fullText": "To Memphis basketball coach Penny Hardaway, the solution is simple.\n\n\"All we have to do is care,\" Hardaway said after the Tigers blew out FAU 92-65 on Jan. 29 at FedExForum to break a two-game losing streak.\n\n\"We have the system, we have great coaches that put the game plan in place, we just haven't been doing the game plan properly, because it hasn't been important enough. Maybe it's individual stats over team, and we only want guys out there that are going to be team.\"\n\nMemphis (10-10, 5-3 American Conference) is coming off a brutal week that included back-to-back losses to Tulsa and Wichita and then extra time spent in Wichita because the Tigers could not travel back home due to the winter storm that affected much of the South.\n\nHardaway said the coaching staff mostly left the players alone during that time.\n\n\"I think that silence was pretty loud there,\" Memphis guard Sincere Parker said.\n\nThe Tulsa game was lost late, but the Wichita State game fell apart in the first half. Leading scorer Dug McDaniel left that game with an injury, but Hardaway said that actually helped him find more lineup combinations.\n\n\"I don't know if I would've seen this coming if it weren't for the second half and Dug getting injured, to be honest,\" Hardaway said. \"Because I don't know if we would've ever put that group out there without Dug. And just to see that just showed us that we can rest Dug.\"\n\nMcDaniel scored 23 points and dished out six assists in the win over FAU.\n\nThough the Owls were missing their top two scorers in Devin Vanterpool and Kanaan Carlyle, it still went down as a dominant win for a Tigers team that got beat handily in Boca Raton earlier this month.\n\nMemphis is back in action on Feb. 1 when it hosts Tulane (2 p.m., ESPN2).\n\n\"We've been playing a little soft in the beginning, and we're trying to change that narrative,\" McDaniel said. \"From this game on, we're going to try to make an emphasis to set the tone first, be more physical off the rip. And I feel like today was a good step in that direction.\"\n\nReach sports writer Jonah Dylan at jonah.dylan@commercialappeal.com or on X @thejonahdylan.\n\n\"I hate to keep saying that, but it's just honest.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on Memphis Commercial Appeal: Penny Hardaway explained Memphis basketball win vs Florida Atlantic",

    "fullText": "Manchester United focused on strengthening up top instead of at the back following the disaster that was the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nIt was decided that a centre-back would join once the current season concluded, with the futures of several stars up in the air.\n\nHarry Maguire’s contract is up in the summer, while Matthijs de Ligt’s injury record makes for grim reading.\n\nWhat the Red Devils really need is a left-footed profile, someone who can eventually succeed Lisandro Martinez and Luke Shaw as the left-sided centre-back.\n\nThe Argentine has been linked with an exit, while criticism continues to grow against him. And as per El Crack Deportivo, United have zeroed in on his compatriot as the perfect backup.\n\nRiver Plate’s Lautaro Rivero has emerged as an option for the 20-time English league champions, and they intend to sign him in the summer.\n\nThe Argentine giants are aware of United’s interest in the 22-year-old, and have therefore slapped a €100 million release clause into his contract.\n\nRiver do not want to lose the Argentina international on the cheap, amid interest from Strasbourg, Tottenham, City Football Group, Juventus, and Atletico Madrid.\n\n“Manchester United intend to secure the services of Lautaro Rivero, a key player in Gallardo’s squad.\n\n“River Plate made Rivero sign a €100 million release clause, so if they want to sign him, they must pay a figure close to that amount.”\n\nRivero is already an Argentina international, and could be on the plane to the US for the World Cup if he continues performing as he has.\n\nHe has made 18 appearances for the River Plate first team and can play both in central defence and as a left-back.\n\nDescribed as an “elite” ball-playing defender, it will be interesting to see if United can get a deal for another South American talent over the line.\n\nHowever, it is likely to be for a fee much lesser than what is being quoted in the report.\n\nFeature image Hernan Cortez via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "MANHATTAN (KSNT) — Kansas State couldn’t get it done against Colorado Thursday night, dropping to 11-11 and 4-5 in conference play.\n\nThe loss came at the hands of a former Wildcat Zyanna Walker, who recorded 13 points and 10 boards for the Buffaloes.\n\nWalker, a junior guard at Colorado, transferred after spending two years with K-State. She started all 36 games for the Wildcats last season in its Sweet Sixteen run, averaging over eight points per game and shooting 40.2%.\n\nThe Big 12 foes clashed back and forth throughout the first half, with neither team ever pulling away. Colorado led by just four at the end of the second quarter.\n\nThe Buffaloes looked to finally pull ahead with 5:38 left in the third off a Jade Masogayo three-pointer to lead by eight. However, the ‘Cats clawed back and kept it within four with ten to go.\n\nK-State looked to gain some momentum in the fourth quarter. A Brandie Harrod and-one gave K-State a three-point advantage with 7:33 to go.\n\nTied with under six remaining, Walker nailed a three-pointer to take back the lead for the Buffaloes. Colorado never looked back and extended its lead to nine by the final buzzer.\n\nColorado defeats the Wildcats 56-47.\n\nFreshman guard Jordan Speiser came off the bench and led the Wildcats in scoring with 12, including going 8-8 from the free-throw line. Senior guard Tess Heal missed her second game for the Wildcats, as she still awaits word from the NCAA regarding her violation.\n\nThe game extends K-State’s skid to two after losing to rival KU 83-61 in Lawrence Sunday.\n\nThe Wildcats look to get back above .500 in Tempe, Arizona, this Sunday against the Arizona State Sun Devils. The Sun Devils sit at 18-4, 4-5 under head coach Molly Miller in her first year at ASU.\n\nFor more sports news, click here.

    "fullText": "Ranking shortstops is never just about comparing stat lines. It is about identifying who provides the most value in baseball’s most demanding position. MLB Network’s “The Shredder” combines recent performance with a deep dive into offensive and defensive metrics to sort the elite from the very good. Here are the 10 players it rates highest as we approach the 2026 campaign.\n\nStats to know: 26 HR, 26 SB (2025).\n\nNeto lands at number 10 on both The Shredder’s list and Brian Kenny’s personal rankings, which speaks volumes about his rapid ascent. The logic for his inclusion is simple enough. He is already producing power and speed from a premium spot on the diamond very early in his career. For the Angels, that dual-threat ability is the cornerstone of a lineup that desperately needs reliable production up the middle.​\n\nDe La Cruz checks in at number nine on The Shredder’s 2026 list, a clear nod to a toolkit that can alter the course of a game even when he isn’t fully dialed in. He holds the same spot on MLB.com’s recap, keeping him firmly within the position’s top tier. His appeal is easy to see. He pressures defenses in ways that almost no other shortstop can, forcing the league to account for him on every single pitch.​\n\nStats to know: .840 OPS (2025).\n\nPeña arrives at number eight for 2026, marking his first appearance in the Top 10 at shortstop according to MLB.com. This detail is significant because these lists typically favor sustained value over isolated hot streaks. Houston has always asked its shortstops to be steady with the glove and productive at the plate, and Peña’s recent performance confirms he is meeting that high standard.\n\nTurner sits at number seven on the SI-reported Shredder list, occupying the territory where consistency and track record start to weigh as heavily as peak potential. His ranking reflects an established history of production that keeps him relevant even as the position gets younger and deeper. When a player remains in this tier year after year, it signals that analysts still trust his baseline contributions despite a crowded field at the top.​\n\nStats to know: 20 HR, 7.1 FanGraphs WAR (2025).\n\nPerdomo lands in sixth place, a jump framed by MLB.com as the result of a breakout season that redefined his profile. While the power surge grabbed headlines, the real differentiator at shortstop is when that offense comes without sacrificing defense. For Arizona, this ranking serves as validation that his strong season wasn’t a fluke. It has moved him onto the short list of the game’s best at his position.\n\nStats to know: 21 Outs Above Average (led NL SS), 17 Defensive Runs Saved (most among SS).​\n\nBetts holds the fifth spot for a second consecutive year, which is impressive considering he is still relatively new to playing shortstop full-time. The defensive metrics highlighted in the SI report explain why he remains here. The model is rewarding legitimate shortstop value rather than just a superstar playing out of position. With the Dodgers committing to him as their starter for 2026, this isn’t a temporary experiment. It is simply their plan.​\n\nHenderson ranks fourth on the 2026 list after entering last season at number one. This placement matters because it suggests his overall package remains elite even if the top spot has shifted. In a ranking system that weighs both offense and defense, staying in the top four means you are impacting the game on both sides of the ball rather than just compiling counting stats.​\n\nLindor slots in at number three, a ranking reserved for players who deliver reliable output year after year at a position that exposes every flaw. He also takes third on MLB.com’s recap, reinforcing that his standing is one of the least debated in the top 10. When a position is this deep, being a consensus top-three choice is an accomplishment in itself. It means your floor is respected just as much as your ceiling.​\n\nSeager enters 2026 at number two on The Shredder’s list, keeping him squarely in the conversation for the game’s best shortstop. He also holds the second spot on MLB.com’s published rankings, aligning the broader view with the model’s data. The main takeaway here is stability. Even with constant turnover around the league, the rankings continue to treat him as a pillar near the very top of the position.​\n\nStats to know: Led MLB in hits for the second straight season.\n\nWitt claims the number one spot for 2026, becoming the sixth different shortstop to lead the list in the last six years. MLB.com links his rise directly to his production, specifically highlighting his back-to-back seasons leading the majors in hits. In a model built to blend offense, defense, and overall impact, that combination of volume and value is exactly what pushes a player to the top of the list.​\n\nRankings don’t win games, but they do show where the league’s most dependable two-way value can be found. This top 10 reminds us that playing shortstop in 2026 requires a wide range of skills that all lead to the same result: winning impact. The only real verdict will come in April when these names have to turn their list positions into victories on the field.\n\nThe post MLB: Top 10 Shortstops heading into the 2026 season appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Alexander Volkanovski and Diego Lopes are just a day away from settling their score once and for all.\n\nAhead of their featherweight championship main event rematch at UFC 325, Volkanovski and Lopes both successfully hit the limit for a UFC title fight, with Volkanovski stepping to the scales at 144.5 pounds and Lopes at 145 pounds.\n\nVolkanovski defeated Lopes via unanimous decision to capture a vacant belt at UFC 314 in April, making “The Great” a two-time featherweight champion. Lopes then fought Jean Silva the following September, scoring a spectacular knockout over Silva to keep his name in the contender mix and eventually get his second crack at Volkanovski, who hasn’t fought since their first encounter.\n\nCo-main event lightweights Dan Hooker and Benoit Saint Denis also successfully made weight with both making use of the one-pound allowance for a non-title fight and registering at 155.75 pounds.\n\nOf the 28 fighters competing Saturday, Aaron Tau was the lone miss, and it was a strange—and costly—one. Tau was the last fighter to weigh in, arriving about 90 minutes into the official window. The Road to UFC flyweight tournament finalist stripped down and was concealed behind a box for his weigh-in, which the commission appeared to struggle with as they took several minutes to register a number.\n\nSurprisingly, Tau came in well under the limit at 122.5 pounds. This immediately raised suspicion and Tau was asked to weigh in again without the box after dressing. He then came in at 129 pounds. Somehow, Tau went from 3.5 pounds under to three pounds over the non-title flyweight limit.\n\nSoon after, it was announced on the UFC’s official morning weigh-in show that Tau’s Road to UFC tournament final bout against Namsrai Batbayar has been cancelled.\n\nAt the desk, Chris Weidman and RJ Clifford questioned if Tau, who flexed while weighing in behind the box, was touching the sides of the curtain with his elbows.\n\nAaron Tau weighs in at 122.5 which is very low for the weight (125) So, the made him re-weigh in without the curtain and he suddenly misses weight at 129!? 7 pounds gained without a curtain!

He turned 38 years old in September.\n\nGoldschmidt is a seven-time All Star and a former MVP.\n\nIn his career, he's a .288 hitter with an .884 OPS and 372 home runs.\n\nMORE: Paul Skenes has added a new pitch\n\nGoldschmidt signed with the Yankees on a one-year, $12.5 million deal before the 2025 season.\n\nFor the Yanks, Goldy batted .274 with a .731 OPS. Just against lefties, though, his OPS was .981.\n\nThat'll definitely work if the Yankees could get production like that out of Goldy one more time.\n\nTeam USA's projected WBC lineup is incredible\n\nDominican Republic's projected WBC lineup is fierce\n\nHow Trent Grisham's decision ruined the Yankees' offseason plans\n\nBuster Posey will change Hall of Fame voting forever\n\nBo Bichette comments exhibit clear hyprocrisy\n\nAndrew McCutchen is not happy with the Pirates",

    "fullText": "Too soon: Bears QB Caleb Williams reacts to unwelcome Rams surprise originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nChicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams recently took part in a promotional unboxing, but the surprise inside was anything but ideal.\n\nThe moment took place at Canon Collectibles in Beverly Hills, California, where Williams opened a Fanatics Under Wraps Mystery Box — a product that guarantees a signed NFL jersey from a random player. Rather than pulling his own name, Williams revealed a jersey belonging to Puka Nacua, a player who played a role in ending Chicago’s season.\n\nMORE: Bears predicted to cut ties with 3-year starter in trade with Titans\n\nNacua caught five passes for 56 yards against the Bears in the divisional round, a game Chicago lost to the Los Angeles Rams in overtime. As he realized whose jersey it was, Williams smiled, shook his head and said, “Damn you, Puka.”\n\nThe reaction was lighthearted, but the meaning was clear. The Rams’ season ended the following week with a loss to the Seahawks in the NFC championship, but for a franchise long defined by missed opportunities, 2025 represented a turning point for Chicago.\n\nMORE: Third-largest U.S. city, smallest NFL crowds: Bears face stadium reality\n\nThe Bears exceeded preseason expectations, played meaningful football in January and matched up competitively with an established contender. In just two years, the Bears appear to have found the most talented quarterback the franchise has ever had.\n\nThe Nacua jersey was an ironic twist, but also a telling one. Chicago no longer wants to be considered second fiddle to the Green Bay Packers in the division or anyone in the NFC for that matter.\n\nThey have bigger goals now that Williams is in town.\n\nBears facing significant challenge with All-Pro safety in free agency\n\nKevin Byard's Bears future gets positive outlook ahead of NFL free agency\n\nBears, Bengals, Panthers, Seahawks among top landing spots for former $141 million future Hall of Fame pass rusher\n\nBears get exciting Nahshon Wright news thanks to Eagles' Quinyon Mitchell",

    "fullText": "Former Wales Under-20s captain Harry Beddall is punching above his weight for Dragons after impressively making the step up to the United Rugby Championship (URC).\n\nThe open-side flanker arrived at Rodney Parade last summer from Leicester and the initial plan was to bed him in gently in Super Rygbi Cymru with Ebbw Vale.\n\nHowever, the 21-year-old from Cardiff has made seven senior outings, five of them starts, and produced a remarkable defensive display at Munster last weekend.\n\nThe official URC stats recorded 33 tackles by Beddall in the 22-20 loss in Cork, as Dragons came agonisingly close to a huge upset.\n\nThe 5ft 10in (1.78m), 14st 11lb (93.9kg) flanker is ranked 15th in the league tackle chart on 99 despite only featuring in six of 10 rounds.\n\n\"He started to make it so hard not to pick him. He is phenomenal and a great talent with a great attitude,\" said Dragons defence coach Dale MacLeod.\n\n\"I have never seen someone with such survivor skills. No matter where he is, whether squashed or held down, he fights to get up and to the next tackle.\"\n\nWales lock Davies called into Six Nations squad\n\nWainwright's emotional Wales return after death of father\n\nBeddall's appetite for defence comes as no surprise after his efforts when captaining Wales in the 2025 Under-20 Six Nations.\n\nHe topped the tournament tackle chart with 109 in five fixtures, including 34 in the backs-to-the-wall win against Ireland in the Rodney Parade rain.\n\nBeddall arrived at Dragons with limited senior experience after a solitary Premiership Cup appearance for Leicester and some outings for Hartpury University RFC in the English Championship.\n\nThe flanker is proving to be cut from the same cloth as Rodney Parade cult hero Nic Cudd, another 5ft 10in (1.78m) open-side that mixed it with the heavy hitters.\n\n\"We talked about 'Bedds' at the start of the season and how we would give him a little bit of a taste because he is only a young man,\" said MacLeod.\n\n\"He got an opportunity because of some injuries and then went out and made something like 20 tackles.Then he went out and made 29.\n\n\"Bedds is like a dynamo and he plays bigger than he is. He is so accurate around collisions and his chop tackling.\"\n\nDragons, who take on Ospreys in Bridgend on Saturday (19:45 GMT) have also picked Thomas Young, Harri Keddie and Shane Lewis-Hughes in the seven jersey this season.\n\nBeddall, the club's lightest forward, has profited from learning from the senior back-row forwards – and now has them sweating on their starting spots.\n\n\"He is very coachable with a want to get better,\" said MacLeod. \"He takes nothing for granted, he keeps working on his action plan and is really clear about how he is going to get there.\n\n\"He rips into it and has been a real find. Some of the older boys are looking behind because he is not just turning up but he's fronting up.\"",

    "title": "A Beans Based AI Workflow",
    "description": "Experimenting on the frontier of AI using beans",
    "fullText": "Since the title is a bit of click-bait, I should probably specify what I mean by bean based.\nI found a lovely tool for creating beans that are essentially just markdown files with some front matter for task tracking.\nNow back to the article!\n\nI feel like a mad scientist.\nI spent the last week analyzing agentic coding tools, ideating on what I like and dislike about them, and then deciding to build my own.\n\nDuring my analysis, the main issue I found with most agentic coding tools right now is that they all focus on one thing: running as many agents in parallel as possible.\nBut why? Why run 10, 100, or even 1000 agents when you are unable to write enough tickets for them to consume?\n\nMaybe I’m wrong. Maybe I should be running hundreds of agents in parallel, but I can’t honestly say I’ve ever run more than 2 at a time.\nBoth working on separate tasks, and I spent most of my time not in setting up and running agents, but in defining the work that needs to be done.\nAlso, the context switching from managing two agents was exhausting.\n\nI want to take this in a new direction. Let’s flip the entire script on its head and think about this pragmatically.\nI don’t think the bottleneck here is a lack of enough agents. The bottleneck is not having clear enough tasks for these agents to work on.\nI can not write instructions fast enough to outpace the work of a single agent. I doubt you can either. Prove me wrong.\nI have yet to see anyone actually write and think fast enough to keep up with the pace of a single agent writing the code.\nMost of my time working with an agent is spent answering questions, rethinking approaches, and dealing with unforeseen bugs.\nIt requires a ton of my attention and focus to handhold these agents.\n\nWhat if we took a different approach? What if we looked at some examples of how software engineering has been traditionally managed?\nIn come PRDs (Product Requirement Documents), made with the explicit intent to get one person’s thoughts into another person’s actions.\nIsn’t that all we are doing with agents now, defining a document for an agent to follow instructions to implement?\n\nI’m building Daedalus, a from-scratch custom planning agent. Yes, I’m building an agent from scratch. Yes, I don’t really know how this will go.\nI believe we live in an exciting wild time with an entire new frontier, waiting to be explored. I’m putting in the time and effort to try an experiment for myself.\nI am willing to accept failure. I am willing to be wrong. I hope that this works.\n\nDaedalus was the greatest mortal craftsman and inventor in Greek mythology—an Athenian architect, engineer, and artist whose name literally means “skillfully wrought” or “cunning worker.”\n\nHe’s essentially the mythological archetype of the brilliant but flawed engineer—someone whose genius creates both wonders and disasters, who solves problems with ingenuity but can’t escape the human consequences of his choices.\n\n— Claude\n\nI chose the name Daedalus because I feel that it embodies the soul of an engineer: planning, thinking, criticizing, researching, and questioning.\nYet, there is hubris manifest in his work, which parallels how I feel about AI coding agents. Daedalus doesn’t write code—that’s not the point.\nThough, he has access to a breadth of expert sub-agents: critics, skeptics, pragmatists, architects, simplifiers, UX researchers, code explorers, and more.\nThe goal for Daedalus is to outpace the coding agent, which I’ve aptly named Talos, the bronze automaton that protected the island of Crete.\nYou don’t talk to Talos, nor do you need to. He finds the next task and starts working. Do note that I’ve tailored Talos to approach coding using TDD (test driven development),\nwhich I’ve found yields a slightly better success rate for autonomous implementation. I borrowed the idea and a few other skills from the superpowers repo.\n\nHowever, that’s not to say what I’ve built is prescriptive. You can do it at home, without any of my specialized tools.\nYou need two agent instances, OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex, it doesn’t matter. One is your coding agent, always in “build” mode.\nIt’s confined to a ralph loop, always picking up the next available task. The other, a planning agent, whose only responsibility is to create tickets and critique what already exists.\nNo specialized tools. This is a workflow, a process. Not something to be sold to you.\n\nA bit more about beans. It describes itself as, “A CLI-based, flat-file issue tracker for humans and robots.”\nHowever, the power in this approach over other longer term memory tools for agents, like beads, is that it’s plain text.\nThe tool parses the front matter of the beans on startup and then works on that in-memory data structure.\nThe beauty is that I can easily read and modify this myself, and I can check it into git.\nAdditionally, beans has a built-in GraphQL API, which is quite handy for the agents to be able to get relational data about these flat files.\nEach bean has a title, status, type, priority, and optional blockedBy fields. I’m using this to handle complicated, long running, and autonomous PRD implementation.\nMy ralph loop starts by querying for beans that are in-progress or todo then creates the dependency graph using the blockedBy field.\nThis allows me to find which bean we need to work on first, pass that bean to the coding agent and let it run.\n\nBeans are the lifeblood of this workflow. Whether or not you use beans or another tool, it doesn’t really matter.\nThe only thing you need to make it work is a structured way to define tasks with enough context that an agent can work on it without human intervention.\nAnd ideally in that structure you have some way to organize which tasks are dependent on the work of other tasks.\n\nYour role in this system is to guide. It’s to sit with the planning agent, and only the planning agent. To scope out features, bugs, epics, and milestones.\nTalk with the planning agent and create a bean, iterate on it, question its design, scope, and purpose. Once you feel like it’s done, move on.\nLet the planning agent write the outline and implementation details in the bean. Then pass it to the coding agent and take a walk.\n\nNow the real power comes from not just creating these beans and passing them to a coding agent. It’s in the dependency graph.\nBeyond just the blockedBy, it’s the parent/child relationships between milestones, epics, features, tasks, and bugs.\nAnd taking advantage of that structure in a ralph loop. Learn more about ralph loops here. As I’ve been experimenting, I’ve noticed additional ways I can modify my loop and make it better.\nThe original ralph loop uses a <promise>DONE</promise> signal to track when the agent says it’s done.\nI rely on the bean being moved to the completed status.\n\nHere’s the flow for my ralph loop (or you can view the source code):\n\nThat’s it, it’s basically a while loop that feeds beans to an AI agent until they’re done.\n\nSo where is Daedalus now? Well it’s still a WIP. You can use the philosophy and workflow now but I am working on a tool to make this significantly easier.\nYou can check out the repo here and use the agents and skills in your OpenCode or Claude Code.\n\nI’d love to hear some feedback on what you think about this experiment.",

    "fullText": "I founded Treehouse in 2011 and was the CEO until it was acquired in 2021. Here's a complete history of what happened at Treehouse.\n\nThe Case for the 32-hour Workweek: Atlantic\n\nSince 2006, Ryan Carson, the CEO of Treehouse, has maintained a four-day workweek for his employees. “There’s no rule that you have to work 40 hours, you have to work more to be successful,” says Carson. “We’ve proven that you can take it from an experiment into something that’s doable for real companies and real people in highly competitive markets.” Citing the benefits of a more flexible schedule, Carson believes that the reduced time in the office ultimately leads to an overall more productive work environment. But for Carson, his decision ultimately comes down to priorities. “It’s not about more family time, or more play time, or less work time—it’s about living a more balanced total life,” says Carson. “We basically take ridiculously good care of people because we think it’s the right thing to do.”\n\nChamath Palihapitiya is the founder of Social Capital, a purpose-driven venture capital firm that invests primarily in healthcare, education, and financial services. (Social Capital was a Treehouse investor.) In this interview from 2013, Pasan Premaratne talks to Chamath about the reasons behind his investment choices and some of the challenges facing entrepreneurs.\n\nOregon Business article about Ryan Carson, CEO of Treehouse\n\nIn 2015, I was voted Entrepreneur of the Year by EY.\n\nJoe had always thought you needed to fit a certain stereotype to be a developer. When he realized there was an opportunity for him to learn to code and make a difference as a developer, he took the risk and switched careers. Since learning with Treehouse, Joe has embraced a rewarding career as a developer.\n\nIn less than 10 months of using Treehouse, Bryan landed his first full time professional programming job and got a huge increase in salary!\n\nKavitha was out of the workforce for 12 years and then one day decided to learn to code and 4 months later she had her first app in the Apple App Store.\n\nI launched Treehouse because I deeply believed in democratizing access to computer science education so people could change their lives. I'm grateful to have led the company to teach over 1,000,000 students in 10 years.\n\nAs time progressed, I learned hard lessons about the importance of focusing on profitability and maintaining strategic clarity. I changed the company's priorities too many times, and I take full responsibility for the outcome.\n\nThroughout my entrepreneurial journey with Treehouse, I gained invaluable insights that have shaped me as a leader and innovator. I learned the critical importance of balancing bold vision with pragmatic execution and adapting quickly to changing market conditions. Cash flow management and profitability are key to building a resilient organization.\n\nMost importantly, I learned that trust is the foundation of any successful venture—trust with investors, employees, and customers. I am committed to applying these lessons with humility, transparency, and a steadfast dedication to creating value for all stakeholders.\n\nAs I move forward in my career, I am excited to leverage my experience and hard-won insights to build organizations that make a lasting, positive impact. I am dedicated to continuous learning and improvement, always striving to earn the trust of those I serve.",

    "description": "Enter The Freak Circus online. A dark horror visual novel of twisted romance. Survive the deadly obsession of Pierrot and Harlequin in this fan game portal.",
    "fullText": "Welcome to the show. Uncover the secrets of The Freak Circus game and survive the twisted obsession of Pierrot and Harlequin.\n\nGame by Garula. Support the creator on itch.io.\n\nWelcome to the definitive fan portal for The Freak Circus game, a psychological horror visual novel that has captivated the indie gaming community. If you are looking to experience The Freak Circus game online or understand its intricate lore, you have arrived at the right place. Developed by Garula, The Freak Circus game stands out in the genre for its unique blend of romance, terror, and obsession. This game is not for the faint of heart, but for those who enjoy a darker shade of storytelling, it offers an unforgettable experience.\n\nThe Freak Circus game presents a yandere-themed narrative where you, the protagonist, become the object of affection for two mysterious and dangerous figures: Pierrot and Harlequin. Set against the backdrop of a chilling carnival, The Freak Circus game weaves a tale where nothing is as it seems. The vibrant lights of the Big Top in The Freak Circus game hide dark secrets, and the laughter of the clowns often masks a sinister intent. The Freak Circus game masterfully explores themes of control, survival, and the blurred lines between love and madness.\n\nThe curtains rise, but who is pulling the strings? In The Freak Circus, every performance could be your last.\n\nPierrot is a central figure in The Freak Circus who commands attention without speaking a word. As a silent yandere, his communication relies on intense gazes and political actions. His route in The Freak Circus game is fraught with tension, creating an atmosphere of constant unease. Many players of The Freak Circus game find his path to be the most unsettling due to the unpredictability of his silence. Unlike traditional visual novel love interests who might use words to woo the player, Pierrot's affection is demonstrated through possessive behavior and eerie pantomime.\n\nThe atmosphere of The Freak Circus game is one of its strongest suits. From the moment you start the game, you are enveloped in a soundscape that is both whimsical and unsettling. The visual design complements this perfectly, with character sprites that shift from charming to terrifying in the blink of an eye.\n\nIn contrast, Harlequin is the vocal and seductive counterpart in The Freak Circus game. Charming yet manipulative, he introduces a different flavor of danger to The Freak Circus game. His rivalry with Pierrot adds a layer of conflict that drives the narrative of The Freak Circus game forward, forcing the player to navigate a deadly triangle of obsession. Harlequin uses his words as weapons, weaving complex webs of lies and half-truths that can easily ensnare an unsuspecting player.\n\nHarlequin's route in The Freak Circus game explores the chaotic side of madness. While Pierrot is static and brooding, Harlequin is dynamic and explosive. He brings a manic energy to scenes that can quickly turn from festive to violent. Players who choose to pursue Harlequin in The Freak Circus game must be prepared for a rollercoaster of emotions, where affection and aggression are two sides of the same coin.\n\nIn The Freak Circus game, death is not the end—it is merely a transformation.\n\nAudio cues in The Freak Circus game often hint at danger. A sudden stop in the music, or the faint sound of music echoing through The Freak Circus game, can indicate that mood has shifted.\n\nBranching paths in The Freak Circus game mean death is never far away. Keep multiple slots, especially before critical decisions involving Pierrot.\n\nThe lore of The Freak Circus game is hidden in the details. Zoom in on background objects to uncover the tragic stories of past victims.\n\nThe setting of The Freak Circus game is more than just a backdrop; it is a character in itself. The Freak Circus game arrives in town overnight, bringing with it a fog that seems to separate the fairgrounds from the rest of reality. In The Freak Circus game, the laws of physics and logic seem to bend. Tents appear larger on the inside than the outside, and the passage of time becomes fluid.\n\n\"The game alludes to a dark history involving the Ringmaster, a figure who is mentioned but rarely seen. Theories suggest that The Freak Circus game is a purgatory for souls who have committed crimes of passion.\"\n\nBoth Pierrot and Harlequin seem trapped in their roles, performing their twisted play for an unseen audience. The arrival of the protagonist disrupts this cycle, offering them a chance at—or perhaps just a new form of—damnation. Understanding this lore enriches the experience of playing The Freak Circus game. It adds a layer of tragedy to the horror. When Pierrot gazes at you with his sad, painted eyes, is he seeing a lover, a savior, or a victim? In The Freak Circus game, the answer is often all three.\n\nSince its release, The Freak Circus game has garnered a dedicated following. The game's unique blend of horror and romance has inspired countless works of fan art, fan fiction, and cosplay. The characters of Pierrot and Harlequin have become icons in the indie visual novel scene.\n\nThe developer, Garula, has been praised for their engagement with the community. Updates to The Freak Circus game often include requested features or nods to popular fan theories. By playing The Freak Circus game on this portal, you are joining a global community of horror enthusiasts who appreciate the darker, more psychological side of storytelling.",

    "fullText": "President Lee Jae Myung said Thursday that workers must adapt swiftly to the era of artificial intelligence (AI), in an apparent message to Hyundai Motor's labor union, which has strongly opposed the carmaker's planned introduction of humanoid robots at production facilities.\n\n\"A labor union appears to have announced that it will stop robots from entering production sites. That may be part of its overall protest strategy,\" Lee said during a meeting with senior aides at Cheong Wa Dae.\n\n\"But once the massive wagon starts rolling, we cannot stop it,\" Lee said, likening the current situation to the past, when the introduction of steam engines triggered machine-breaking protests by laborers worried about losing jobs.\n\nLee added: \"Ultimately, society has to adapt quickly. People need to learn new skills and adjust rapidly to the new environment.\"\n\nThe president stressed the importance of preparing workers for technological change rather than resisting it, as AI-driven automation accelerates across industries. He also underscored the need for fundamental policies to prepare for extreme polarization in an AI-driven economy.\n\nWhile Lee did not name a specific labor group, his comments were widely interpreted as directed at Hyundai Motor's labor union, which recently lashed out at the carmaker's plans to deploy humanoid robots at production sites.\n\nIn a statement released earlier in the day, the union said management is seeking to materialize a so-called \"dream factory\" that operates 24 hours a day using only AI-powered robots.\n\n\"There is no place for humans anywhere in the plan,\" the union said, expressing concerns that robots would ultimately take over all jobs.\n\nThe union added that Hyundai Motor Group discussed the unmanned factory initiative, dubbed the \"DF247\" project, as a key priority at its annual Global Leaders Forum earlier this month. The project envisions fully automated facilities operating around the clock.\n\nThe union warned that such developments would eventually affect all workers in Korea, arguing that the balance between consumption and supply would be disrupted, creating a vicious cycle in the nation's economy.\n\nThe union statement came about a week after the workers voiced strong opposition to the carmaker's plan to deploy Atlas robots made by Boston Dynamics, its U.S. robotics unit, across major assembly lines in Korea and overseas.\n\nHyundai Motor has identified the Atlas robot as a key future growth engine in the emerging era of physical AI.\n\nThe company unveiled its vision at the CES 2026 tech fair earlier this month, outlining plans to mass-produce up to 30,000 humanoid robots by 2028 and gradually deploy them at its manufacturing sites, including Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America in Georgia.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea Handler, 50, says being childfree didn't stop her from taking parenting classes to show up for other kids.\n\nOn Thursday's episode of \"Dinner's On Me with Jesse Tyler Ferguson,\" Handler spoke about her choice not to have children and her close relationship with the three daughters of an ex-boyfriend.\n\n\"It's not that I don't have a maternal instinct. I do, I just don't want children,\" Handler told podcast host Jesse Tyler Ferguson.\n\n\"I feel like not having my own children has opened me up to being in the lives of so many other children,\" Handler said. \"Of course, I love children. I just don't want them around me all the time.\"\n\nThe comedian said she enjoys being a positive influence on kids, whether it's in the role of a big sister or a parental figure.\n\n\"Whatever it is, I have the bandwidth — because I don't have children — to spend time with so many children,\" she said.\n\nHandler said she's still close with her ex-boyfriend's three daughters, despite dating him for only a year, in part because she recognized parts of her own upbringing in their experiences.\n\n\"I related so much to all of that because I grew up in a household where I was the youngest of six. My parents were completely checked out,\" Handler said. \"My brothers and sisters raised me, and I craved and wanted the parent that was going to show up to the games, and show up to the school conference nights, and be at my plays, and be at my, you know, at like the auditorium at school.\"\n\n\"My parents didn't do any of that. And so that's what I wanted to be for them,\" she continued.\n\nHandler said she even took parenting classes for the girls.\n\n\"But I did it, and I loved it. Like, I learned so much from the psychologist about what children need to feel safe, secure, and seen,\" Handler said.\n\nShe added that being involved in their lives feels meaningful to her.\n\n\"For me, since I'm not a parent, I still find it so purposeful to have influence over them in a positive way, and to go out of my way for them feels good.\"\n\nHandler has previously spoken about how being childfree has given her the freedom to build close relationships with the children in her life.\n\n\"I've been able to show up for other people's children in ways that I wouldn't be able to if I had my own family,\" Handler said in an April appearance on the \"Reclaiming with Monica Lewinsky\" podcast. \"So I feel like there is an unsung story about people who don't have children, whether it's by choice or by, you know, circumstance, that there are so many opportunities to have children in your life and and you have to find those.\"",

    "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook says a global memory chip shortage is beginning to bite, with rising costs expected to pressure margins ahead.",
    "fullText": "The global memory chip shortage is catching up with Apple, Tim Cook says.\n\nThe Apple CEO said on the company's first-quarter earnings call that Apple is beginning to feel the effects of the memory shortage crisis, with rising prices expected to put pressure on margins ahead.\n\nThe warning comes amid blockbuster demand for Apple's newest products. Customer response to the latest iPhone lineup \"exceeded our expectations,\" with iPhone revenue jumping 23%, Cook said on the call Thursday.\n\nApple reported revenue of $143.76 billion and earnings per share of $2.84, beating analyst estimates.\n\nThe staggering iPhone demand left Apple exiting the December quarter with \"very lean\" inventory, pushing the company into what Cook described as \"supply chase mode.\"\n\nCook said the biggest constraint is the limited access to advanced chipmaking nodes used to produce Apple's system-on-a-chip processors. Higher demand has also reduced flexibility across Apple's supply chain, he said.\n\nMemory shortages played a minimal role in Apple's December-quarter margins, but their impact is expected to grow, Cook added.\n\nThe company expects memory costs to weigh more heavily on margins in the second quarter, contributing to its forecast gross margin range of 48% to 49%. Apple posted a gross margin of about 48% in the December quarter.\n\n\"We do continue to see market pricing for memory increasing significantly,\" Cook said. \"As always, we'll look at a range of options to deal with that.\"\n\nApple's stock price rose about 2% after hours following the results on Thursday.\n\nCook's comments come as the tech industry grapples with a worsening global shortage of memory chips.\n\nAI companies, smartphone makers, and PC manufacturers are competing for the same pool of memory components, which are critical not just for consumer electronics but also for powering large language models and other AI systems. That surge in demand has sent prices climbing.\n\nAt CES 2026 last month, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, described the memory storage market as \"completely unserved.\"\n\n\"This market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world's AIs,\" he said at CES with analysts.\n\n\"The amount of context memory, the amount of token memory that we process, KB cache we process, is now just way too high,\" he added, referring to AI storage needs.\n\nThe Korea Economic Daily reported in January that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are seeking server DRAM price hikes of 60% to 70% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter. Market analysis firm Counterpoint also said last month that memory prices could climb as much as 40% through the second quarter of 2026.\n\n\"The memory market is at an unprecedented inflexion point, with demand materially outpacing supply,\" an analyst from global market intelligence firm International Data Corporation wrote in a December note.\n\nThe rapid buildout of AI infrastructure marks a break from the industry's traditional \"boom-and-bust cycles.\"\n\n\"For consumers and enterprises alike, this signals the end of an era of cheap, abundant memory and storage, at least in the medium term,\" the analyst added.",

    "fullText": "Costco did not even sell merchandise on its website until 1998, and, in those days, the selection was very limited.\n\nAs a longtime member, I used the website for benefits such as Costco Travel and ancillary services, like TurboTax access, that the warehouse club sells. Until much more recently, though, I rarely bought anything there.\n\nNow, Costco has a greatly expanded selection, and it allows members to use Instacart and Shipt to order select items directly from its warehouses. It's building on that with its digital-only program, Costco Next, which lets members access items the warehouse club does not stock.\n\nIt's not a new service; it has technically been around since 2017. But Costco does not promote the offering, and it's something I, and many other members, did not know about.\n\nIn fact, I only learned about it because the chain started mentioning it during earnings calls, which most members do not listen to or read transcripts of.\n\nA third-party marketplace like the model pioneered by Amazon, Costco Next offers an expanded selection of items that never make it into a Costco warehouse. The program, however, differs from Amazon's approach in important ways.\n\nApril 17, 2001: Costco expands online with a B2B e‑commerce site aimed at business customers, accessible through the main Costco.com site, according to a 2001 Costco earnings release.\n\n2017: Costco partners with Shipt for grocery delivery in select U.S. markets and expands same‑day and two‑day delivery options for members, reported SuperMarket News.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic (2020 to 2021): Online sales surge dramatically as consumer demand for non‑contact shopping grows. Costco’s ecommerce growth in 2020 surpassed the prior five years combined, according to the retailer's fourth-quarter 2021 earnings release.\n\nCostco's deal with Shipt ended in 2025, according to Costco's website, and was replaced with an Instacart partnership.\n\n\"Our digital vision at Costco is to deliver a seamless experience that builds trust and loyalty with our members both in warehouse and online,\" Costco CEO Ron Vachris said during the company's first quarter 2025 earnings call. \"We aim to make shopping at Costco easier, faster, and more personal, no matter where or how our members choose to shop. This isn't about technology for technology's sake.\"\n\nCostco Next allows the retailer to offer more merchandise, but have it shipped directly from partners. The warehouse club, however, is still careful with its merchandise, and its buyers work with partner retailers.\n\nIt's a more carefully curated selection than Amazon offers, because Costco remains focused on offering value to members. The retailer has grown Costco Next from its modest beginnings.\n\nCostco sees major shift in member behavior\n\nHistory of Costco: Company timeline and facts\n\nRetail chain shuts all locations as legal changes hit industry\n\nLululemon struggles to reverse concerning customer behavior\n\nT-Mobile launches free offer for customers after major loss\n\n\"Costco Next, our curated marketplace, also continues to show healthy year-over-year growth. In Q3 fiscal year 2025, our sales on Costco Next equaled our total sales for all of fiscal year 2022, and we are excited about the pipeline of new vendors and development for future rollout,\" CFO Gary Millerchip said during the company'sthird quarter 2025 earnings call.\n\nCostco Next is a curated third‑party marketplace that lets Costco members buy directly from select brands and manufacturers at discounted prices, without Costco holding all the inventory itself.\n\nProducts are offered from hand‑selected suppliers chosen for the quality of their merchandise and strong customer service, expanding the variety beyond typical warehouse inventory.\n\nThe platform helps Costco offer higher‑margin discretionary items (e.g., electronics, appliances, goods sold directly from vendors) while leveraging member pricing perks.\n\nAccording to strategic reports, Costco Next has become a scalable engine for high‑margin products, with estimated sales in Q3 2025 equal to Costco’s entire fiscal 2022 performance in that channel, AInvest reported.\n\nThe impetus for Costco Next is to strengthen e‑commerce and mobile growth by offering discounted deals from trusted brands that complement warehouse inventory.\n\n“Separate from what members will find in the warehouses or at Costco.com, Costco Next showcases products from some of Costco’s suppliers that have been selected for the quality of their merchandise and their exceptional customer service,” Costco General Merchandise Manager Cheryl Smeby said on Costco's website.\n\n“By shopping at Costco Next, you have access to a variety of products from these vendors, and you’ll get a discount that is available only to Costco members.\"\n\nCostco is not alone in adding an online marketplace.\n\n\"Marketplaces are a relatively simple, low-capital way of expanding choice and widening audiences,\" GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders shared on RetailWire.\n\nHe believes, however, that it's not as simple as tacking on an online marketplace to an existing business.\n\n\"If they work, they can generate incremental revenue. But they are not surefire winners. Retailers need to make sure they don’t just cannibalize existing sales, and they cannot be used as an excuse to neglect the core proposition. And of course, there are now so many marketplaces that the strategy is not really a big differentiator,\" Saunders added.\n\nHis Retailwire Brain Trust colleague, Jeff Hall, believes that online marketplaces are table stakes, but must be run with intent.\n\n\"They allow you to expand assortment, enter new categories, and test demand without tying up capital or taking markdown risk. Just as important, they attract new customers who often convert into higher value buyers of owned inventory,\" he posted.\n\nCostco Next has been around since 2017, but the brand has never promoted it.\n\n\"Costco instead relies on its memberships and rotating selection of deals to do the selling for it, often through social media and word of mouth. Costco Next benefits similarly from this fear of missing out,\" CustomerThink.com shared.\n\nThe services launched with about 15 suppliers.\n\n\"There are currently over 90 brands included in the Costco Next universe. Some are familiar: Mikasa dinnerware, Dearfoams slippers and Thomas Kinkade Studios fine art. You’ll also find Artika lighting products, Baggallini accessories, Bench activewear, Cangshan handcrafted cutlery, Briggs & Riley luggage and Golden Arowana flooring, among others,\" Kiplinger reported.",

    "description": "Microsoft’s stock has plummeted 12% owing to a slight miss on revenue, showing how spooked investors are by the “spend now, profit later” AI market.",
    "fullText": "Wall Street’s yearslong bet on AI is facing a severe test on Thursday, as investors might begin to view OpenAI—and generative AI in general—not as a catalyst for continuous growth, but as a source of systemic risk for Big Tech.\n\nA sharp selloff in tech stocks on Thursday underscored investors’ exhaustion with the “spend now, profit later” model that has propelled the AI bull market for three years. Microsoft led the retreat, with its shares plummeting 12% by noon, erasing more than $440 billion in market value, a collapse it hasn’t seen since the pandemic. The Nasdaq was down almost 2% at time of writing.\n\nWhy did Microsoft's stock plunge 12% on Thursday?\n\nWhy are Oracle shares down from September highs?\n\nHow much of Microsoft's future revenue depends on OpenAI?\n\nWhat is driving investor concerns about AI capex spending?\n\nThe immediate catalyst, it seems, is an intensifying focus on capex, or capital expenditures. Microsoft revealed that its spending surged 66% to $37.5 billion in the latest quarter, even as growth in its Azure cloud business cooled slightly. Even more concerning to analysts, however, was a new disclosure that approximately 45% of the company’s $625 billion in remaining performance obligations (RPO)—a key measure of future cloud contracts—is tied directly to OpenAI, the company revealed after reporting earnings Wednesday afternoon. (Microsoft is both a major investor in and a provider of cloud-computing services to OpenAI.)\n\n“It’s the collapse of software and the ascent of hardware, and it is staggering,” CNBC’s Jim Cramer noted on X on Thursday, as the market punished companies that are spending billions on software infrastructure while failing to show immediate returns.\n\nIt’s an “ominous” statistic, Morning Brew cofounder Austin Rief wrote on X, especially combined with the fact that Meta is planning to devote most of their free cash flow to capex. Meta has evaded the selloff on a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast, showing a healthy 24% year-over-year revenue increase, driven by online ads. The fact that Wall Street is letting Meta get away with their also massive capex indicates the reason why investors are selling off: They don’t trust OpenAI to bring that revenue on their own without massive infusions of outside cash.\n\nThe sentiment shift is not limited to Redmond. Oracle has seen its shares halved from their September highs, erasing nearly $463 billion in value. Once a darling of the AI trade, Oracle has also struggled with investor confidence that the massive data centers it is building for OpenAI will get funded eventually. Additionally, the timeline for several projects has reportedly slipped to 2028, creating a gap between the company’s heavy debt-funded spending and the arrival of actual revenue.\n\nOpenAI has made about $1.4 trillion in commitments to procure both the energy and compute it needs to fuel its operations. But its revenue barely crossed $20 billion in 2025.",

    "description": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Maine arrested an asylum-seeker and hauled him away, leaving behind his one-month-old baby and wife, who does not have a driver's license.",
    "fullText": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Maine arrested an asylum-seeker and hauled him away, leaving behind his one-month-old baby and wife, who does not have a driver’s license.\n\nThe Portland Press Herald reported on Wednesday that on Jan. 21, Hassane Barry and his wife, Nene Barry, who are asylum-seekers from Guinea, were on their way home from an appointment to obtain a passport for their baby. But Hassane Barry never made it home, as his car was abruptly boxed in by four unmarked vehicles.\n\nThe Press Herald described the arrest:\n\nArmed and masked federal agents stepped out and said Hassane’s name. They were here for him.\n\n“There’s a baby in the car,” Barry told the agents. “There’s a baby.”\n\nAgents shattered his driver’s side window. Glass sprayed over the baby’s car seat, Nene Barry said. Her husband was arrested and pulled into an unmarked police car. Officers left the scene in a matter of minutes.\n\nNene Barry, who does not have a driver’s license and speaks little English, was left alone inside the car with her infant.\n\n“He did everything for us, and now he’s not here. What am I going to do alone with a 1-month-old baby in the cold?” Nene Barry said in an interview this week in French.\n\nVideo given to the Press Herald shows the aftermath of the incident. Shards of glass littered the street and the interior of the car. “I have a baby,” Nene Barry repeated in broken English.\n\n“There was a car seat in the back with one of those baby blankets you get at the hospital. There were broken glass shards all over it,” one witness told the paper, on condition of anonymity due to concerns for their safety. “I carefully pulled back the blanket and there was just this tiny peanut of a baby. He was crying.”\n\nHassane Barry, 38, has no known criminal record, his attorney said, and a search for a criminal history yielded no results. His English tutor told the Press Herald that Barry worked as a tow truck driver for AAA and worked as a ride-share driver on the side. At last check, Barry was being held at a detention facility in Plymouth, Massachusetts.\n\nNene Barry said she is afraid to leave her home, and has left just once, to bring her son to a medical appointment.\n\nThe arrest comes amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants, as well as immigrants who are in the country legally.\n\nLast week, an ICE agent in Portland went viral after he was filmed telling a woman that she was going into a “database” for “domestic terrorists” for daring to film him in public.\n\nThe post ICE Agents Shatter Car Window After Being Told ‘There’s a Baby’ Inside, Haul Asylum-Seeking Father Away first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "The tech giant is doubling down on a trend of companies operating with leaner workforces, though it's still on the hunt for rockstar talent.",
    "fullText": "CEO Mark Zuckerberg said AI tools now let individual Meta employees do work that once required large teams.\n\nMeta plans to boost AI spending by between 60% and 87% this year as output per engineer continues to rise.\n\nDespite compute constraints, Meta said it's looking to hire top AI talent.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says AI is transforming what a single employee can accomplish at the company, signaling it's adopting a new hiring strategy.\n\nOn an earnings call with analysts Thursday, Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said the company is investing in more AI-native tools to elevate individual contributors and flatten teams. The effort is being somewhat constrained, however, by a lack of compute resources.\n\n\"We're starting to see projects that used to require big teams now be accomplished by a single very talented person,\" he said. \"I want to make sure that as many of these very talented people as possible choose Meta as the place that they can make the greatest impact.\"\n\nThe Facebook and Instagram parent, which reported fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, said it plans to boost AI spending by between 60% and 87% this year. Meta also said it already saw a significant increase in output per engineer last year, with the majority of that growth coming from the adoption of agentic coding.\n\nThough teams are on track to become smaller, finance chief Susan Li said on the earnings call that the company is still hungry for top talent. \"It remains a very competitive hiring market, but we'd like to invest aggressively where we can,\" she said.\n\nLi also noted that Meta closed out the December-ended quarter with 6% more employees than it had a year earlier, driven by hiring in areas such as monetization, infrastructure, Meta Superintelligence Labs, regulation, and compliance.\n\nMeta isn't alone in focusing on tiny teams. The strategy has become popular in the startup world, where founders have long prioritized scrappiness. It's a trend that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted would take hold back in February 2024.\n\n\"We're going to see 10-person companies with billion-dollar valuations pretty soon,\" he said at the time. \"In my little group chat with my tech CEO friends, there's this betting pool for the first year there is a one-person billion-dollar company, which would've been unimaginable without AI. And now [it] will happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, large companies have been thinning their middle manager ranks in recent years to boost efficiency by reducing bureaucracy, including Amazon and Intel. Meta's Zuckerberg wrote a memo in 2023 entitled \"Flatter is faster,\" and in late 2024, Google CEO Sundar Pichai told staff that the company cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of an efficiency push.",

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — President Donald Trump’s latest attempt to sidestep the United Nations through his new Board of Peace appears to have inadvertently backfired after major world powers rejected U.S. aspirations for it to have a larger international mandate beyond the Gaza ceasefire and recommitted their support for the over 80-year-old global institution.\n\nThe board to be chaired by Trump was originally envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing his plan for Gaza's future. But the Republican president’s ambitions have expanded to envisioning the board as a mediator of worldwide conflicts, a not very subtle attempt to eclipse the Security Council, which is charged with ensuring international peace and security.\n\nThe board's charter also caused some dismay by stating Trump will lead it until he resigns, with veto power over its actions and membership.\n\nHis secretary of state, Marco Rubio, tried to ease concerns by saying the board's focus right now is only on the next phases of the Gaza ceasefire plan.\n\n“This is not a replacement for the U.N., but the U.N. has served very little purpose in the case of Gaza other than the food assistance,” Rubio said at a congressional hearing Wednesday.\n\nBut Trump's promotion of a broadened mandate and his floating of an idea that the Board of Peace “might” replace the U.N. have put off major players and been dismissed by U.N. officials.\n\n“In my opinion, the basic responsibility for international peace and security lies with U.N., lies with the Security Council,” Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Thursday. “Only the Security Council can adopt decisions binding on all, and no other body or other coalition can legally be required to have all member states to comply with decisions on peace and security.”\n\nIn Security Council statements, public speeches and behind closed doors, U.S. allies and adversaries have dismissed Trump’s latest plan to overturn the post-World War II international order with what he describes as a “bold new approach to resolving global conflict.”\n\n“The U.S. rollout of the much broader Board of Peace charter turned the whole exercise into a liability,” according to the International Crisis Group’s Richard Gowan, a U.N. watcher and program director. “Countries that wanted to sign on to help Gaza saw the board turning into a Trump fan club. That was not appealing.”\n\n“If Trump had kept the focus of the board solely on Gaza, more states, including some more Europeans, would have signed up,” he said.\n\nKey Security Council members haven't signed on\n\nThe four other veto-wielding members of the Security Council — China, France, Russia and the United Kingdom — have refused or have not indicated whether they would join Trump's board, as have economic powers such as Japan and Germany.\n\nLetters sent this month inviting various world leaders to be “founding members” of the Board of Peace coincided with Trump’s vow to take over Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and punish some European countries that resisted. That was met with stark rebuttal from Canada, Denmark and others, who said Trump’s demand threatened to upend an alliance that has been among the West's most unshakeable.\n\nShortly after, Trump pulled a dramatic reversal on Greenland, saying he had agreed with the NATO secretary-general on a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security.\n\nAmid the diplomatic chaos, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who at the time had not responded to Trump’s Board of Peace invitation, met with Guterres in London and reiterated “the UK’s enduring support for the UN and the international rules-based system,” according to a statement.\n\nStarmer emphasized the U.N.’s “pivotal role in tackling global problems which shape lives in the UK and all over the world.” The United Kingdom later declined to join the board.\n\nFrance, Spain and Slovenia declined Trump’s offer by mentioning its overlapping and potentially conflicting agenda with the U.N.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said last week that the board goes beyond “the framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.”\n\nSpain would not join because the board excluded the Palestinian Authority and because the body was “outside the framework of the United Nations,” Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said.\n\nSome countries are urging a stronger UN\n\nAmerica’s adversaries also have shunned the board.\n\n“No single country should dictate terms based on its power, and a winner-takes-all approach is unacceptable,” China’s U.N. ambassador, Fu Cong, said at a Security Council meeting Monday.\n\nHe called for the United Nations to be strengthened, not weakened, and said the Security Council’s status and role “are irreplaceable.”\n\nIn a clear reference to the Board of Peace, Fu said, “We shall not cherry-pick our commitments to the organization, nor shall we bypass the U.N. and create alternative mechanisms.”\n\nSo far, about 26 of some 60 invited countries have joined the board, and about nine European countries have declined. India did not attend Trump’s signing ceremony at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last week but is reportedly still deciding what to do. Trump revoked Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s invitation.\n\n“It’s hardly surprising that very few governments want to join Trump’s wannabe-U.N., which so far looks more like a pay-to-play club of human rights abusers and war crimes suspects than a serious international organization,” said Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director for Human Rights Watch. “Instead of handing Trump $1 billion checks to join his Board of Peace, governments should work on strengthening the U.N.”\n\nEight Muslim nations that agreed to join the board issued a joint statement that supported its mission in Gaza and advancement of Palestinian statehood. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates made no mention of Trump’s global peacemaking plan.\n\nThe Crisis Group’s Gowan said their focus could be a way to “get a foothold in discussions of Gaza” at the start, as Trump’s ceasefire plan has already faced several setbacks.\n\n“I remain unconvinced that this is a real long-term threat to the U.N.,” Gowan said.",

    "fullText": "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) said Thursday there is a “very strong case” to charge the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) official who shot Alex Pretti multiple times on Saturday with voluntary manslaughter.\n\n“I see a case that requires a state investigation and requires a state determination as to whether prosecution is warranted,” Shapiro said at an event hosted by The Christian Science Monitor.\n\n“I would argue, based on the publicly available evidence, that you could make a very strong case for voluntary manslaughter against the federal official who pulled the trigger multiple times.”\n\nVideo of the incident shows Pretti recording immigration officials before attempting to assist a woman whom one agent had pushed to the ground. At that point, he was shoved down himself and surrounded by officers, with one appearing to disarm him before another fired multiple rounds at the 37-year-old.\n\nCBP, which oversees Border Patrol, notified Congress on Tuesday that two agents fired shots during the incident, according to The Associated Press.\n\nShapiro, who previously served as the Keystone State’s attorney general, also said there is a “very strong case” the Border Patrol agents committed obstruction of justice when they did not secure the crime scene.\n\n“I think you might be able to make out a case for conspiracy, if there was a clear directive that that crime scene should be compromised, that you should not participate in an investigation,” the Pennsylvania governor added. “So I think all three of those charges could be warranted.”\n\nShapiro noted, though, that he is “not privy” to all the evidence that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison (D) and local prosecutors have regarding the shooting.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) took over the investigation into the incident over the objections of Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA), which oversees use-of-force incidents by officers in the state.\n\nIn a lawsuit brought by the BCA, a federal judge in Minnesota blocked DHS on Saturday from “destroying or altering” evidence from its probe.\n\nWhite House border czar Tom Homan, meanwhile, said at a Thursday press conference that the federal immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota has not been “perfect.”\n\n“I do not want to hear that everything that has been done here has been perfect. Nothing is ever perfect. Anything can be improved on and what we’ve been working on is making this operation safer, more efficient, by the book,” said Homan, whom President Trump dispatched to the state to handle the operation earlier this week.",

It will ultimately depend on how much the Broncos want to spend.\n\nFor PFF's Bradley Locker, he thinks Denver should go all in on Dallas Cowboys demon George Pickens.\n\n\"The Broncos advanced to the AFC Championship Game on the heels of their elite defense, but their offense remains a bit of a worry going into 2026,\" Locker wrote. \"Denver will need to better a unit that ranked 25th in passing success rate, and a weapon like Pickens would enable exactly that.\"\n\nMore:Broncos' Sean Payton makes stunning revelation on Bo Nix injury\n\nHaving Pickens and Sutton, along with a steady run game and tight ends, Nix, if everyone stayed healthy, would have quite the offense in 2026.\n\nPickens exploded with Dak Prescott in 2025, totaling over 1,400 yards and 9 TDs from his 93 receptions. That is the sort of production Denver needs.\n\nYes, it will be pricey, but Pickens proved that the character narratives surrounding him, for the most part, weren't a thing at all in Dallas.\n\nHe's earned his big contract, and if it sees him land with the Broncos, Nix will be one happy quarterback.\n\nESPN hints at major reason Todd Monken moved on from Ravens\n\nKeon Coleman the big winner from Bills press conference\n\nRavens' Jesse Minter offers perfect quote on Lamar Jackson\n\nAnalyst sees potential trade for Eagles' $29 million weapon\n\nBills urged to sign All-Pro weapon for Josh Allen\n\nBills' Joe Brady solves Keon Coleman's future with 1 sentence",

    "fullText": "Michigan State football is reportedly \"regaining the momentum\" in their pursuits for a big-time prospect in the 2026 class.\n\nRivals recruiting insider Greg Smith reported on Thursday that Michigan State is \"regaining the momentum\" in a key recruiting battle with Penn State for four-star wide receiver Samson Gash. National signing day is right around the corner, and it appears that it'll come down to the Spartans or Nittany Lions for Gash's commitment.\n\nGash is a four-star wide receiver, with a recruiting rating of 90.80 in 247Sports' composite system. He ranks as the No. 47 wide receiver and No. 6 player from Michigan in the 2026 class. He is also listed as the No. 289 overall prospect in the class.\n\nGash has been verbally committed to Michigan State since the summer, but elected to not sign with the Spartans during the early signing period due to the recent coaching change. However, he has never fully opened up his recruitment and it appears Michigan State may still be in the drivers seat to add this elite-level wide receiver.\n\nClick on the post below to read more from Smith on the latest in Gash's recruitment:\n\nOne team is regaining the momentum for 4-star WR Samson Gash as his final decision nears, via @GregSmithRivals👀\n\nGash is currently committed to Michigan State. \n\nRead: https://t.co/SNUOYVRBfQ pic.twitter.com/gQZBni46sj\n\n— Rivals (@Rivals) January 28, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

    "fullText": "Yes, the Warriors can trade for both Giannis Antetokounmpo and LeBron James. Here's how originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Giannis Antetokounmpo sweepstakes are officially here.\n\nESPN's Shams Charania reported on Wednesday that two-time NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo is \"ready for a new home\" with the Bucks listening to offers ahead of the February 5 trade deadline.\n\nAs you might imagine, it didn't take long for the rumor mill and NBA content machine to crank into hyper drive with seemingly half the league mentioned as a possible suitor. The Heat, Timberwolves, Hawks, Knicks, 76ers, Rockets, Nets and several others have all been most prominently linked to the 31-year-old future Hall of Famer. They all might be tough-pressed to match the Warriors if Mike Dunleavy Jr. puts Golden State's best foot forward.\n\nThat the Warriors are interested in Antetokounmpo should come as no surprise.\n\nWith Jimmy Butler's season-ending torn ACL, Jonathan Kuminga's trade demand, Draymond Green's unwavering commitment to drama-inducing behavior, Steve Kerr's future beyond this season in doubt and Stephen Curry's open frustration with the state of the organization, Golden State's short- and long-term prospects are hanging perilously in the balance.\n\nMORE:Ranking the best Giannis landing spots\n\nOn its own merit, pushing the chips in for Antetokounmpo would be a seismic move unto itself.\n\nBut what if the Warriors dared to dream even bigger? What if Golden State decided that acquiring the Greek Freak wasn't enough to vault back into contention? What if Joe Lacob decided to go for broke and also make a play for LeBron James?\n\nImagine the thought of a Curry-James pick and roll with Giannis waiting in the dunker spot. You'd watch, I'd watch and the those three on the same team would instantly command the respect of every other title contender... regardless of what Curry himself thinks of a potential trade.\n\nThe math works and neither the restrictive aprons nor salary caps would get in the way.\n\nHere is a hypothetical (REPEAT: HYPOTHETICAL) three-team trade that works.\n\n(Editor's note: Fanspo's NBA trade machine is by far the best one out there with updated picks, salaries, restrictions and specific conditional feedback on why trades do or don't work).\n\nWarriors get: Giannis Antetokounmpo, LeBron James, Thanasis Antetokounmpo\n\nLakers get: Draymond Green, Myles Turner, Will Richard\n\nBucks get: 4 future first-round picks, 3 pick swaps, Jimmy Butler, Jonathan Kuminga, Brandin Podziemski, Quentin Post\n\nMilwaukee badly needs to restock its draft capital if its going to enter a full rebuild. And of the teams potentially in the market for Giannis, only the Nets can rival Golden State's war chest of future picks.\n\nThe Warriors can offer up to four first-round picks along with three additional swaps. Only three are listed above as the Warriors have a top-20 protected 2030 pick owed to Washington (if that pick falls between 1-20, in this scenario it would go to Milwaukee).\n\nThe Bucks would be hedging against the Warriors' long-term future with picks out as far as 2032 when Curry would be 43, Antetokounmpo 37 and James well into retirement.\n\nButler would presumably be trade bait for next season on an expiring contract, potentially fetching additional draft compensation though his $56.8 million salary would be difficult to move. Kuminga presents an interesting low-risk upside play while this trade also allows them to move off a sizeable and lengthy commitment to Myles Turner.\n\nMORE: Tracking latest Giannis trade rumors\n\nIf the Warriors stand pat, its a signal they are content to ride out Curry's career as a middling fringe playoff or play-in team.\n\nMoving out the picks for Antetokounmpo immediately extends Golden State's window. Such is the reality when you have two of the NBA's top seven players on your roster.\n\nThe LeBron James piece of the equation is where things get really interesting. That bloated $52.6 salary complicates the money going out and Golden State's most realistic path towards getting James after sending out the money required to bring back Antetokounmpo is to include Draymond Green.\n\nThe Warriors could, instead of Green, cobble enough salary to send the Lakers between Buddy Hield, Al Horford and Moses Moody but doing some would strip what little depth remains in the first place. While breaking up the Curry-Green pairing would hurt, its also difficult to imagine Green fitting in at all offensively with Curry, Antetokounmpo AND James.\n\nThat Curry-Green chemistry can't be replicated but if there's one player on the planet with the IQ to pull off a reasonably proxy overnight, its James. Golden State would probably want some assurances that James would come back for at least one more full season, but even if he doesn't, there's not much tread left on Green's tires either.\n\nBeyond the basketball fit, one also wonders if its simply time. If Kerr and the organization at large is simply worn down and ready to move on, perhaps swapping out Green for James may inject some energy back into Steve Kerr.\n\nMORE:Klay Thompson's dad weighed in on the Giannis rumors\n\nThere's a growing sense of frustration within the Lakers and that was before ESPN's bombshell about the Buss family and potential turbulence with the James relationship.\n\nIn this scenario, the Lakers functionally swap James for Turner and Green in a frontcourt overhaul. Both Turner and Green offer significant upgrades defensively, Turner offers some stretchiness from the 5 to open things up for Luka Doncic and Green would surely be motivated to play with an Everest-sized chip on his shoulder.\n\nMORE:LeBron admits 'no way' he imagined playing on Lakers for 8 years\n\nTurner is under contract for three more seasons with the third a player option while Green owns a player option for next season. Moving James now, even for players with longer commitments, also means they won't have the discount haggling sure to happen this season with James and agent Rich Paul. There are already reports that the Lakers would ask James to take a significant discount, something he's in the past shown no willingness to consider.\n\nIf the Lakers did say yes, it probably also means finding a taker for Deandre Ayton who has an $8 million player option for next year but will surely opt out. If the Lakers could turn Ayton into another shooter, they would fully hand the on-ball keys to Doncic and Austin Reaves with more complementary pieces around the fringes.\n\nIs that more exciting than having LeBron James? Absolutely not. But it does give JJ Redick more outs and roster flexibility.\n\nThere's a million reasons trades like this never happen. It's a massive reset involving three teams with onerous contracts, bloated egos, luxury tax and apron implications and so much more.\n\nWill this happen? Almost assuredly not.\n\nCan it happen? Anything is impossible!",

    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO (AP) — Brooks Koepka felt nerves he had not experienced in years. The swagger that was such a hallmark of his five major championships was replaced by concern about the reception he would get upon his return to the PGA Tour after nearly four years on Saudi-funded LIV Golf.\n\nKoepka didn't make a birdie until his final hole Thursday. He failed to break par on the tough South course at Torrey Pines in the Farmers Insurance Open.\n\nAnd there was a small measure of relief.\n\n“I’m just grateful to be out here and have a chance to compete with these guys,” Koepka said.\n\nA large gallery followed him around on a glorious day along the Pacific bluffs with occasional shouts of, “Welcome back, Brooks.” On his way to the second tee, two young boys called out to him and Koepka walked over for fist bumps. He walked the entire 30 yards of a fence where fans wanted his autograph after his 1-over 73.\n\n“I care about what everybody’s thinking out here, what everybody’s doing, and just trying to be as good of a person and good of a player as I can be,” Koepka said. “Just wanted a warm reception. Just like everybody else, you walk into a room, nobody wants to feel exiled. They just want to be loved.”\n\nKoepka was freed from the final year of his nine-figure contract with LIV Golf on Dec. 23, applied for his PGA Tour membership about two weeks later and in three days was provided a path back.\n\nThe hard part was how he would be received. That's what brought the relief, and a big smile even after a round in which he hit the ball cleanly and couldn't buy a putt. The 8-footer for birdie on the 18th was the longest putt he made all day.\n\n“I'm the only one in the entire world that’s going through this situation so it’s very difficult to explain,” Koepka said. “But I’m enjoying it, I really am.”\n\nAnd now he has company, with former Masters champion Patrick Reed leaving LIV Golf with a chance to return to the PGA Tour as early as September. Koepka didn't see that coming and only learned about it during his pro-am Wednesday.\n\n“Yeah, it's wild,” Koepka said. “Whatever Patrick wants to do and to be the best golfer he can be, best for his family, I'm in full support of that.”\n\nKoepka said he felt nervous on the first tee, though it didn't show. He piped his drive 301 yards at sea level into the fairway, one of his better iron shots of the day to 10 feet and missed his putt.\n\n“I guess I should have been more nervous the rest of the round,” Koepka said.\n\nThe South course is among the strongest on the PGA Tour, producing more pars than any excitement. Koepka missed birdie chances on both par 5s on the front nine, and he made a sloppy bogey on the par-5 13th when his flip wedge up the steep hill to a flag he couldn't see was too strong and went into the rough behind the green.\n\nHe was 11 shots behind Justin Rose, who had a 62 on the easier North course, and eight shots worse than Seamus Power, who had a 65 for the low score on the South.\n\n“It’s been a while since I played competitive golf, so I like the way I’m playing,” said Koepka, who last played Oct. 5 at the Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland. “I just need to kind of play my way into it.”\n\nHis departure to LIV Golf in 2022 — one of the biggest surprises among the players who left the PGA Tour for the guaranteed Saudi riches — felt much longer ago. Koepka couldn't recall if he heard any comments outside the ropes in Portland when he made his LIV debut.\n\nAnd he wasn't sure what to expect in San Diego.\n\n“I don’t like thinking ahead at all or trying to anticipate what was going to happen, but I wasn’t sure, which is kind of weird being uneasy,” he said. “From the first tee on, it was great. It actually made me settle down a little bit. Like I said, it made me feel good just to be out here.”\n\nKoepka is in the Phoenix Open next week. He is not in the $20 million signature events unless he qualifies. His return also stipulates a $5 million charity donation, no access to PGA Tour equity shares for five years, no FedEx Cup bonus money he might earn this year.\n\nThe tour also said whenever Koepka plays he will be added to the field to not take a spot from anyone. And then two more players get into tournaments on Monday of tournament week to make sure every group is a threesome.\n\nThe two beneficiaries this week were Jackson Suber and Lanto Griffin, a big deal to Griffin because Torrey Pines is his favorite course and he otherwise would not be in except for Koepka.\n\nThat led Griffin to say jokingly, “If Brooks really wants to create some goodwill, he should enter every tournament and then withdraw on Tuesday.”\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf",

I didn't hit enough fairways ... didn't really make any putts besides 18 right there.\n\n\"It's been a while since I played competitive golf, so I like the way I'm playing, I just need to kind of play my way into it.\"\n\nKoepka's move back to the PGA Tour, which had banned players that jumped to LIV, comes under a new returning member program that includes limitations on eligibility for some top events, and a five-year forfeiture of rights to participate in the PGA's player equity program.\n\nKoepka, who is also making a $5 million charitable donation as one of the conditions of his reinstatement, said the speed at which the puzzle pieces fell in place had \"kind of blown my mind.\"\n\n\"I'm just grateful to be out here and have a chance to compete with these guys,\" he said.\n\nHe'll need to go low on Friday to have a chance to make the cut.\n\nRose, the 2013 US Open champion, torched the North Course with 10 birdies, just missing an 11th at his final hole, the par-five ninth, that would have given him the course record.\n\n\"It's funny how you can walk off frustrated for sure,\" said Rose, who said he second-guessed himself on the tricky birdie putt.\n\n\"But, listen, I made my share out there today. My process was fantastic. I feel like I managed my game really, really well today.\n\n\"I didn't feel like I played perfect golf so it's a good reminder that you don't always have to play perfect golf but it was good enough,\" added Rose, who was one stroke in front of American Justin Lower.\n\nJapan's Hideki Matsuyama picked up five strokes in his last five holes with an eagle and three birdies to grab a share of third on eight-under 64, tied with American Max Greyserman.\n\nIreland's Seamus Power had the round of the day on the South Course, carding a seven-under 65 to share fifth place alongside Germany's Stephan Jaeger and American Maverick McNealy.",

    "description": "In his return from LIV Golf, Brooks Koepka got a welcoming reception in the Farmers Insurance Open while shooting 73 on the South Course",
    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO — The temperature at Torrey Pines already had risen to an inviting mid-60s at 9:30 a.m. on Thursday when Brooks Koepka stepped onto the first tee of the South Course. The weather was unseasonably warm and comfortable, with not a cloud in the sky—basically mirroring the feeling and reception the five-time major winner got as he returned to the PGA Tour after a 3½-year absence while competing on LIV Golf.\n\nMORE: The other side of Brooks Koepka\n\nMaybe it was just sleepy morning for fans on the cliffs above the Pacific Ocean, but there were no wild cheers from a gallery of a couple hundred. A few people shouted, “Love you, Brooks,” and others offered, “welcome back!” Koepka’s group partner, past Farmers Open winner Max Homa, drew louder support.\n\nOn the other hand—and probably more meaningful to Koepka—there was not a single audible jeer for the man who was among the most high-profile American players to depart for a controversial league while making more than $150 million doing it. The only heckling Koepka seemed to get was after the round when an obnoxious man loudly and repeatedly asked him to sign a golf ball following the golfer spending 15 minutes working along an autograph line of mostly kids. \"I'm your biggest fan!\" the guy bellowed, but that still didn't get him a signature.\n\nKoepka would admit after the round that he was feeling more nervous than he had in quite a while but hardly looked shaky while striping his opening drive into the fairway.\n\nA page turned on a new chapter of his life.\n\n“Yeah, it was great. The fans were awesome today,” Koepka said. “I think it was very cool to hear ‘welcome back.’ It was pretty much every hole, which is great. I loved to hear it and I'm excited for the next few days.”\n\nHe admitted why he was concerned about the reaction.\n\n“I just cared about my perception, what people thought or what the fans thought,” he said. “It's easy when you're around the players and they come and talk to you or you talk to them, or caddies or people around here, but everybody else, I wasn't sure.”\n\nWhile saying he was feeling jitters on the first tee, Koepka deadpanned, “I guess I should have been more nervous the rest of the round.\" He made only one birdie—on the 18th hole—in shooting one-over-par 73 on the two-time U.S. Open course.\n\nTied for 101st place after Round 1, Koepka could perhaps take solace in being even with his former U.S. Ryder Cup teammates, Xander Schauffee and Patrick Cantlay, and defending Farmers Open champion Harris English. He also bested his two playing partners, with Homa shooting 75 and Ludvig Aberg, who won the Genesis Invitational at Torrey Pines last February, struggling to a 78.\n\nThat’s how tough the South Course is and Koepka was playing his first competitive round since the DP World Tour’s Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in early October.\n\n“It felt good,” said Koepka, who hit only six fairways, but more than doubled his greens reached with 13. “It's been a while since I played competitive golf, so I like the way I'm playing; I just need to kind of play my way into it.”\n\nOne of the primary reasons, Kopeka has said, for his return to the PGA Tour is the desire to spend more time with his family, and he said his wife, Jena Sims, and their 3½-year-old son, Crew, would be out at Torrey Pines this week.

At one point, he said he had “fallen back in love with the game” while watching Crew begin to show interest in it.\n\n“I guess I want him to watch me play well,” he said, “and realize how much this game’s given me, how fun it is, and how cool it is to just be out here.”",

    "description": "The Steve Aoki concert cake throw is a signature for the Grammy-nominated DJ, and a guest appearance by Diego Lopes stands out.",
    "fullText": "Steve Aoki is a major UFC fan, so much so that he's invited multiple fighters on stage at his concerts through the years, and also DJ'd the wedding of former bantamweight champion Aljamain Sterling.\n\nThe Grammy-nominated artist and producer moved his schedule around to attend this past Saturday's UFC 324 event in Las Vegas and has a number of favorites on the roster. One name repeatedly came to Aoki's mind when discussing his UFC fandom with MMA Junkie on the UFC 324 red carpet, especially when asked who he thinks has done the best cake throw into the crowd, which is a signature of his performances.\n\nThat man is UFC 325 headliner Diego Lopes (27-7 MMA, 6-2 UFC), who faces Alexander Volkanovski (27-4 MMA, 14-3 UFC) in a rematch for the featherweight title Saturday at Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney (Paramount+).\n\n\"Diego, I would have to say, was very impressive,\" Aoki told MMA Junkie. \"We were in Mexico together, and I played in Puebla in his city where he trains. This was the second time we caked. We did it before when he was with me in Guadalajara. The crowd was at least 25 feet away. I did not think he was going to make it over there, because it's difficult.\n\n\"There's a real art to cake throwing. It's not like you can pick up a cake, and you can actually nail someone in the face. It's actually difficult. He actually launched it, and it got some head shots. I was impressed. There is evidence of him nailing some amazing head shots. So I think Diego is one of the best fighting IQs, for sure, for me when I watch him, and he definitely has the cake IQ, too.\"\n\nLopes shared the video of the cake throw Aoki mentioned from November 2024. He still holds up the spot as No. 1 cake thrower more than a year later, and now he'll try to add the distinction of No. 1 featherweight in the world to his resume, as well.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: DJ Steve Aoki names Diego Lopes as best UFC cake thrower",

But also for NBC and their streaming platform, Peacock, as they will be presenting both events live all day in 4K HDR. Via a press release, this will mark the first time a Super Bowl and Olympic Games will be presented in 4K HDR on the NBC broadcast network and the Peacock.\n\nIn a statement, Rick Cordella, President of NBC Sports, believes that because February will be a huge month for sports for the network, they feel obligated to deliver the best viewing experience possible.\n\n“When you’re about to present the biggest month in U.S. sports media history, you want to make sure you’re giving fans the best experience possible – so that’s exactly what we have planned on NBC and Peacock for Super Bowl LX, the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, and NBA All-Star Weekend,” said Cordella. “Building on NBC Sports’ long-standing commitment to innovation across all platforms, we’ll be celebrating the action on the field, slopes, and court with our signature storytelling, state-of-the-art production, and dynamic streaming features that together bring these incredible sporting events to life for audiences at home.”\n\nThe platform will be presenting other innovations with their Olympic coverage by expanding their Multiview feature to mobile, which activates a four-box vertical display that showcases the top four events at any given time. Patrick Miceli, Chief Technology Officer, NBCUniversal Media Group and Global Streaming, states Peacock leads the industry in preesnting high profile events due to their infrastructure.\n\n“Peacock is the first streamer to deliver major live sports at this scale, seamlessly presenting many simultaneous events, with millions of people coming to the platform at once, over several days,” said Patrick Miceli, Chief Technology Officer, NBCUniversal Media Group and Global Streaming. “This impressive performance is possible because of Peacock’s industry-leading infrastructure that supports unmatched reliability, especially under peak demand.”\n\nPeacock’s February doesn’t stop with the Olympics and the Super Bowl, as for the first time in over 20 years, NBC will produce NBA All-Star Weekend onsite in Los Angeles.",

    "fullText": "“No Mercy” will be on ice for a bit — literally and figuratively.\n\nTwo-time Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Bantamweight champion Petr Yan will be out of action until at least summer 2026 after undergoing a minor back procedure, a development that was confirmed by his longtime manager, Danny Rubenstein.\n\n“He had a minor procedure on his lower back that he went into the Merab fight with,” Rubenstein told MMA Junkie recently. “He’ll be ready in July.”\n\nWhile the surgery is considered minor, it makes his performance last month even more impressive as the Russian standout powered through the issue and reclaimed the Bantamweight title with a dominant victory over Merab Dvalishvili at UFC 323, extending his winning streak to four straight.\n\nThe timing of the injury is unfortunate for fans, as Yan is widely regarded as one of the most skilled and entertaining fighters in the division. However, the layoff does allow both Yan and Dvalishvili ample time to recover and prepare for what appears to be an inevitable rubber match later this year.\n\nThe setback also eliminates any chance of Yan competing on the historic UFC White House card scheduled for June, a bout many had speculated could include a rematch against former champion Sean O’Malley. With Yan unavailable, “Sugar” will have to look elsewhere if he hopes to secure a spot on that high-profile event.\n\nIf the promotion wants to get wonky, an interim title fight involving O’Malley isn’t out of the question — setting up a unification bout once Yan returns to full health. Whether the UFC goes that route remains to be seen.\n\nFor now, the priority is Yan’s recovery. Assuming everything goes according to plan, the Bantamweight king should be back in the title picture by midsummer — and when he returns, the division will once again have its most dangerous technician at full strength.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhen the Denver Broncos abruptly fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi this week, it sure seemed like a move to help ensure that they didn't lose quarterbacks coach Davis Webb.\n\nThe Broncos have yet to officially name Webb the team's new offensive coordinator, but they need to do that as soon as possible. Webb is reportedly taking his name out of consideration to be the next head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders, so that could pave the way for that.\n\nNix called his own press conference to address his broken ankle, clearing up and correcting some of what Payton said following the injury.\n\nDid not have Bo Nix calling his own press conference & addressing Sean Payton’s over sharing of his injuries on today’s bingo card. They’ll work through it but clearly not on the same page at the moment. pic.twitter.com/R7ad90EgjM\n\n— Zach Bye (@byesline) January 29, 2026\n\nNow, there is no doubt that Nix and Payton have respect for each other, but how much do they really like one another? The two have had heated spats during games before, so if you want to chalk this latest story up to anything minor, you're badly missing the boat.\n\nThis is something that could become a serious disturbance for this team. The Broncos have a strong head coach and a great young quarterback, but are they on the same page? Do they like working together?\n\nThis is where Webb comes in. He is that bridge between the coach and the player and he will be the glue that keeps what the team has going together. That makes him a guy the Broncos can't allow to get out the door.\n\nAccording to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, the Broncos were looking to offer their offensive coordinator job to Joe Brady, who was hired as the new head coach of the Buffalo Bills. Hours later, the Broncos fired Lombardi, seemingly paving the way for Webb to be promoted into that role.\n\nREAD:Broncos' two huge offseason signings could already be on their way out\n\nNow that Webb is apparently taking himself out of the running for the Raiders job, the Broncos need to make it official.\n\nBroncos' Vance Joseph may be down to just one possibility to be head coach in 2026\n\nBroncos sign Deuce Vaughn, 6 other players to future contracts\n\nBroncos Schedule: Which opponents will Denver face in 2026?\n\nBroncos must do everything in their power to sign 27-TD free-agent running back",

New episodes will stream weekly on Thursdays, chronicling the stories of trailblazing quarterbacks from the AFL-NFL merger through the turn of the century who faced systemic barriers and cultural challenges while reshaping one of the most scrutinized positions in sports.\n\nThe series explores how Black quarterbacks were often steered away from the position, questioned for their leadership and intelligence, and forced to overcome entrenched stereotypes both on and off the field. Through archival footage, interviews and historical context, Field Generals traces how these athletes helped redefine what success at quarterback looks like in the NFL and paved the way for future generations.\n\nNBC Sports’ Maria Taylor serves as an executive producer alongside Michael Yarvitz, Bill Wolff, Andrew Singer and Eddie Michaels. Rikki Hughes serves as both director and executive producer. The docuseries is produced in association with NFL Films, with Jessica Boddy, Keith Cossrow, Ken Rodgers and Ross Ketover serving as executive producers.\n\nThe series features firsthand perspectives from a wide range of former and current Black quarterbacks, including James “Shack” Harris, Warren Moon, Doug Williams, Randall Cunningham, Vince Evans, Chuck Ealey, Rodney Peete, Donovan McNabb, Michael Vick and Lamar Jackson.\n\nAdditional voices include journalists, executives, and cultural commentators who help frame the broader social and historical significance of the position, such as Michael Wilbon, Rich McKay, Joe Gibbs, Michael Eric Dyson, Jayne Kennedy, Bomani Jones, Michael Beschloss and Bob Costas.\n\nThe series trailer can be viewed here.",

Webb interviewed for head coaching jobs with the Raiders, Bills and Ravens. pic.twitter.com/4FYpPGQ0MX\n\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) January 30, 2026\n\nDavis Webb was considered a favorite for the Las Vegas Raiders head coaching job, but all signs point to them favoring Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak instead. Both the Cardinals and the Raiders are waiting until this weekend to meet with him in hopes of hiring him after the Super Bowl. With the writing on the wall and likely not wanting to be the backup option, Webb withdrew his name from consideration.\n\nWith Webb officially out of the Raiders’ head coaching search, he becomes one of the hottest offensive coordinator names currently on the market. Several teams, including the Baltimore Ravens, New York Giants, and Philadelphia Eagles (before they hired their OC earlier today) have already put in requests to interview Webb for their offensive coordinator positions. Also, his current team, the Denver Broncos, fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi and would like to promote Webb to offensive coordinator if possible.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Webb will interview with the Ravens, Giants, or any other teams for their offensive coordinator jobs. He has impressed in interviews, is viewed as an up-and-coming coach, and is well-liked and regarded around the league so it would make sense for teams to be interested. However, with the Broncos firing Lombardi and opening up their offensive coordinator position, you have to assume there is mutual interest between the two sides and that the Broncos are the favorites to land him as their offensive coordinator.\n\nWebb would benefit from another year under Sean Payton and would get more valuable experience as his offensive coordinator. While he may not call plays, he would be in the booth, communicating with Payton throughout the game, and would be a key part of game-planning each week.\n\nThere is no guarantee that Webb will return to the Broncos, as other teams can and likely will offer him play-calling opportunities, but I believe they will make a strong push for him. This should unfold in the coming days, and hopefully, Webb returns to the Broncos, this time, as their offensive coordinator.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe playoffs are often where players' reputations are enhanced, or they are ruined, and for Houston Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud, his performance in this year's playoffs could have disastrous effects.\n\nAfter throwing four first-half interceptions against the New England Patriots, C.J. wilted under the pressure, as it was another season where he failed to live up to his rookie season.\n\nNow comes the harsh part. Do the Texans pay Stroud franchise quarterback money?\n\nThe fact that we are even asking that tells you all you need to know.\n\nAnd for PFF's John Kosko, this isn't a great spot for C.J. or the Texans to be in.\n\n\"A year ago, he went throw-for-throw with Patrick Mahomes in the divisional round, as both quarterbacks produced three big-time throws,\" Kosko writes. \"What followed in the postseason this year needs little explanation. Stroud’s 32.3 overall grade underscored how much he struggled to take the next step.\n\n\"Performances like that can derail a promising trajectory, making 2026 a critical prove-it season for Stroud to show this was merely a blip rather than a turning point.\"\n\nMore: Jarrett Stidham’s opening drive against New England only made things worse for C.J. Stroud\n\nShould they, and will they, are two different questions.\n\nShould they? Possibly. Will they? Likely yes.\n\nAnd the reason is that Stroud is entering the final year of his rookie deal, before the Texans can pick up his option, so there will be two seasons that the franchise will be able to evaluate C.J. and decide if they want to offer him top QB money.\n\nIn an ideal world, entering Year 4, you already know if you want to extend your QB, but the fact that we have so many questions aimed at Stroud isn't ideal.\n\nYear 4 is going to be a defining one for C.J.\n\nESPN hints at major reason Todd Monken moved on from Ravens\n\nDrake Maye injury update: Patriots' Mike Vrabel addresses QB concerns\n\nChiefs coach unknowingly drops monster update on Travis Kelce's future\n\nDolphins predicted to replace Tua Tagovailoa with backup QB\n\nBills urged to sign All-Pro weapon for Josh Allen\n\nRavens must answer $17 million question this offseason",

    "description": "The Dallas Cowboys are looking for defensive players they can pick up in the 2026 NFL draft and these Senior Bowl standouts ae great options",
    "fullText": "While the top two teams in the NFL prepare for the Super Bowl, the Dallas Cowboys and 29 other squads are firmly fixated on talent acquisition. From coaching staff to free agency to the 2026 NFL draft, the Cowboys are treasure hunting.\n\nMidway through Senior Bowl week, some draft hopefuls are standing out amongst their peers. The hope for Cowboys fans is that some of these standouts are at positions of need for Dallas. The Cowboys need to add players at linebacker, defensive end, safety, offensive tackle and cornerback, just to name a few. As luck would have it, some of those players are indeed flashing in practice.\n\nEarly standout reports have highlighted the defensive ends who have been jumping off the screen. The one’s mentioned here at Cowboys Wire have continued their strong play and should firmly be on Dallas’ radar this April. Today we look at three more.\n\nBud Clark has been turning heads here at the midpoint. The 6-foot-1, 185-pound safety from TCU was an intriguing prospect from the start. Over the past two seasons, he’s scored the third best film grade in the country. Despite a diminutive stature, Clark has been showing up as a run defender in the box, putting to bed some size concerns about his jump to the NFL.\n\nClark has been making plays on the ball in coverage and filling gaps against the run, proving to be a do-it-all defensive back. In 2023 he played 393 snaps in the slot, but over the last two seasons he’s mixed it up evenly between slot, box and deep.\n\nClark is the ideal candidate to replace free agent Donovan Wilson for the Cowboys because he can be moved everywhere including a nickel role. Clark is rocketing up draft boards and should move into the top 100 (currently a consensus rank of 185)\n\nDeath, taxes, Bud Clark making plays at the Senior Bowl.\n\nTCU safety has been a star all week. pic.twitter.com/nm3nZWRlwP\n\n— Max Chadwick (@CFBMaxChadwick) January 29, 2026\n\nJacob Rodriguez has proven he’s every bit as advertised. The Tech standout has been everywhere on the field, picking off balls in coverage and punching out balls in the open field. In this extremely deep LB class, Rodriguez is a star.\n\nPhysical traits stand to hold him back on draft boards, but the kid is a mental giant who just makes plays. Rodriguez has set the bar at the LB position scoring the highest PFF score all time amongst Power-4 LB prospects. Given he’ll probably be a Day 2 pick, he’s going to be a steal for someone this year.\n\nTexas Tech’s Jacob Rodriguez had an all-time performance for a LB on Day 2 of the Senior Bowl. \n\nNot only did he show off his peanut punch with a forced fumble, but he also had an INT to end the day and was the best LB in coverage in one-on-ones pic.twitter.com/W8yEm4F2k7\n\n— Bobby Football (@Rob__Paul) January 29, 2026\n\nAt just under 6-foot and weighing 183 pounds, Malik Mohammad isn’t the typical tall CB the Cowboys are attracted to but he’s making it up in tenacity and stickiness at the Senior Bowl. Quick and fluid, Muhammad has shown he can stay with any build, both outside and inside.\n\nThe Cowboys are in the market for a new CB with inside ability. They felt the loss of Jourdan Lewis immensely and this prospect appears to be a great replacement option.\n\nMalik Muhammad continues to stack good rep after good rep pic.twitter.com/AQNk9J2Poz\n\n— TJ Wengert (@TJWengert) January 28, 2026\n\nYou can follow Reid on X @ReidDHanson and be sure to follow Cowboys Wire on Facebook to join in on the conversation with fellow fans!\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cowboys Wire: Midway checkpoint: 3 local Senior Bowl standouts who fit the Cowboys",

    "description": "Modern neuroscience understands the brain as a set of specialized systems. Aspects of brain function such as attention, perception, memory, language and...",
    "fullText": "Modern neuroscience understands the brain as a set of specialized systems. Aspects of brain function such as attention, perception, memory, language and thought have been mapped onto distinct brain networks, and each has been examined largely in isolation.\n\nWhile this approach has yielded major advances, it has left unresolved one of the most basic facts about human cognition: its overall unity as an integrated system.\n\nNow, researchers at the University of Notre Dame have conducted a neuroimaging study to investigate how the brain is organized and how that integrated system gives rise to intelligence.\n\n“Neuroscience has been very successful at explaining what particular networks do, but much less successful at explaining how a single, coherent mind emerges from their interaction,” said Aron Barbey, the Andrew J. McKenna Family Professor of Psychology in Notre Dame’s Department of Psychology.\n\nPsychologists have long known that areas as diverse as attention, perception, memory and language are correlated, forming what they term “general intelligence.” This accounts for how humans function and adapt in a wide range of academic, professional, social and health contexts. It shapes how efficiently we learn, reason and perform in response to a multitude of everyday problems and tasks.\n\nFor more than a century, this structure has suggested that cognition is unified at a fundamental level. What has been missing is a theory to explain why such unity exists.\n\n“The problem of intelligence is not one of functional localization,” said Barbey, who is also the director of the Notre Dame Human Neuroimaging Center and the Decision Neuroscience Laboratory. “Contemporary research often asks where general intelligence originates in the brain — focusing primarily on a specific network of regions within the frontal and parietal cortex. But the more fundamental question is how intelligence emerges from the principles that govern global brain function — how distributed networks communicate and collectively process information.”\n\nBarbey and his research team, including Notre Dame graduate student and lead author Ramsey Wilcox, investigated the predictions of the unifying framework, called the Network Neuroscience Theory. Their study was recently published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nGeneral intelligence is not itself a skill or strategy, the researchers argued. It is a pattern — the tendency for diverse abilities to be positively correlated. The study argues that this pattern reflects differences in how efficiently brain networks are organized and work together.\n\nTo test this claim, the cognitive neuroscientists analyzed brain imaging and cognitive data from one of the largest studies conducted to date, examining 831 adults in the Human Connectome Project, along with an independent sample of 145 adults in the INSIGHT Study, which was funded by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity’s SHARP program. The researchers integrated measures of both brain structure and function to enable a more precise characterization of the human brain.\n\nRather than identifying intelligence with a particular cognitive function or brain network, the Network Neuroscience Theory characterizes it as a property of how the brain works as a whole. In this view, intelligence reflects how brain networks are coordinated and dynamically reconfigured to solve the diverse problems we encounter in life.\n\nThis research represents an important shift, according to Barbey and Wilcox.\n\n“We found evidence for system-wide coordination in the brain that is both robust and adaptable,” Wilcox said. “This coordination does not carry out cognition itself, but determines the range of cognitive operations the system can support.”\n\n“Within this framework, the brain is modeled as a network whose behavior is constrained by global properties such as efficiency, flexibility and integration,” Wilcox said. “These properties are not tied to individual tasks or brain networks, but are characteristics of the system as a whole, shaping every cognitive operation without being reducible to any one of them.”\n\n“Once the question shifts from where intelligence is to how the system is organized,” Wilcox noted, “the empirical targets change.”\n\nThe researchers found evidence to support four predictions of the Network Neuroscience Theory.\n\nFirst, the theory predicts that intelligence is not localized to a single brain network but arises from processing distributed across multiple networks. Intelligence, therefore, depends on how the brain manages the division of labor across different networks and combines them as needed.\n\nSecond, for the brain to manage this distributed processing, it requires integration and effective long-range communications. To synchronize those efforts, Barbey said, there is “a large and complex system of connections that serve as ‘shortcuts’ linking distant brain regions and integrating information across the networks.” These pathways connect structurally distant areas of the brain, enabling efficient communication and supporting coordinated processing across the system.\n\nThird, effective integration requires regulatory control that coordinates interactions among networks by shaping how information flows throughout the brain. These areas serve as regulatory hubs, reaching out to other networks to orchestrate the brain’s ongoing activities. They selectively recruit the appropriate networks for the specific task at hand — whether it be piecing together subtle clues to make sense of a problem, learning a new skill or deciding whether a situation requires careful deliberation or a rapid, intuitive response.\n\nFinally, Barbey said that general intelligence depends on the brain’s ability to balance local specialization with global integration. In other words, the brain functions best when tightly connected local clusters communicate well, but are still able to link to distant regions of the brain across short communication paths. This makes the most effective problem-solving possible, according to the co-authors.\n\nThe research suggests that intelligence is unified not because the brain relies on a single general-purpose processor, but because the same organizational principles shape how all cognitive functions work together.\n\nAcross both datasets, individual differences in general intelligence were consistently associated with these system-level properties. No single region or canonical “intelligence network” accounted for the effect.\n\n“General intelligence becomes visible when cognition is coordinated,” Barbey noted, “when many processes must work together under system-level constraints.”\n\nThe implications of this study extend beyond intelligence research, he added. By grounding cognition in large-scale organization, the study offers a principled account of why the mind is unified at all.\n\nThis framework helps explain why intelligence develops broadly during childhood, declines with aging and is particularly sensitive to diffuse brain injury. In each case, it is large-scale coordination — not isolated function — that changes.\n\nThe findings also inform ongoing debates about artificial intelligence and how AI models are developed. If general intelligence in humans arises from system-level organization rather than from a dedicated general-purpose mechanism, then achieving general intelligence in artificial systems may require more than the accumulation or scaling of specialized capabilities.\n\n“This research can push us into thinking about how to use design characteristics of the human brain to motivate advances in human-centered, biologically inspired artificial intelligence,” Barbey said.\n\n“Many AI systems can perform specific tasks very well, but they still struggle to apply what they know across different situations.” Barbey said. “Human intelligence is defined by this flexibility — and it reflects the unique organization of the human brain.”\n\nThe research was conducted with co-authors Babak Hemmatian and Lav Varshney of Stony Brook University.\n\nContact: Tracy DeStazio, associate director of media relations, 574-631-9958 or tdestazi@nd.edu",

    "description": "Two Army pilots went on an ill-conceived training mission. Within two hours, 67 people were dead.",
    "fullText": "This article was featured in New York’s One Great Story newsletter. \n\nOne year ago, on January 29, 2025, two Army pilots strapped into a Black Hawk helicopter for a training mission out of Fort Belvoir in eastern Virginia and, two hours later, flew it into an airliner that was approaching Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing all 67 aboard both aircraft. It was the deadliest air disaster in the United States in a quarter-century. Normally, in the aftermath of an air crash, government investigators take a year or more to issue a final report laying out the reasons the incident occurred. But in this case, the newly seated U.S. president, Donald Trump, held a press conference the next day and blamed the accident on the FAA’s DEI under the Biden and Obama administrations. “They actually came out with a directive, ‘too white,’” he claimed. “And we want the people that are competent.”\n\nIn the months that followed, major media outlets probed several real-world factors that contributed to the tragedy, including staffing shortages at FAA towers, an excess of traffic in the D.C. airspace, and the failure of the Black Hawk to broadcast its location over ADS-B — an automatic reporting system — before the collision. To address this final point, the Senate last month passed the bipartisan ROTOR Act, which would require all aircraft to use ADS-B — “a fitting way to honor the lives of those lost nearly one year ago over the Potomac River,” as bill co-sponsor Ted Cruz put it.\n\nAt a public meeting on Tuesday, the National Transport Safety Board laid out a list of recommended changes in response to the crash, criticizing the FAA for allowing helicopters to operate dangerously close to passenger planes and for allowing professional standards to slip at the control tower.\n\nWhat has gone unexamined in the public discussion of the crash, however, is why these particular pilots were on this mission in the first place, whether they were competent to do what they were trying to do, what adverse conditions they were facing, and who was in charge at the moment of impact. Ultimately, while systemic issues may have created conditions that were ripe for a fatal accident, it was human decision-making in the cockpit that was the immediate cause of this particular crash.\n\nThis account is based on documents from the National Transportation Board (NTSB) accident inquiry and interviews with aviation experts. It shows that, when we focus on the specific details and facts of a case, the cause can seem quite different from what a big-picture overview might indicate. And this, in turn, suggests different logical steps that should be taken to prevent such a tragedy from happening again.\n\nThe whine of the Blackhawk’s engine increased in pitch, and the whump-whump of its four rotor blades grew louder, as the matte-black aircraft lifted into the darkened sky above the single mile-long runway at Davison Army Airfield in Fairfax County, Virginia, about 25 miles southwest of Washington, D.C.\n\nThe UH-60, as it’s formally designated, is an 18,000-pound aircraft that entered service in 1979 as a tactical transport aircraft, used primarily for moving troops and equipment. This one belonged to Company B of the 12th Aviation Battalion, whose primary mission is to transport government VIPs, including Defense Department officials, members of Congress, and visiting dignitaries. Tonight’s flight would operate as PAT 25, for “Priority Air Transit.”\n\nBlack Hawks are typically flown by two pilots. The pilot in command, or PIC, sits in the right-hand seat. Tonight, that role was filled by 39-year-old chief warrant officer Andrew Eaves. Warrant officers rank between enlisted personnel and commissioned officers; it’s the warrant officers who carry out the lion’s share of a unit’s operational flying. When not flying VIPs, Eaves served as a flight instructor and a check pilot, providing periodic evaluation of the skills of other pilots. A native of Mississippi, he had 968 hours of flight experience and was considered a solid pilot by others in the unit.\n\nBefore he took off, Eaves’ commander had discussed the flight with him and admonished him to “not become too fixated on his evaluator role” and to remain “in control of the helicopter,” according to the NTSB investigation.\n\nHis mission was to give a check ride to Captain Rebecca Lobach, the pilot sitting in the left-hand seat. Lobach was a staff officer, meaning that her main role in the battalion was managerial. Nevertheless, she was expected to maintain her pilot qualifications and, to do so, had to undergo a number of annual proficiency checks. Tonight’s three-hour flight was intended to get Lobach her annual sign-off for basic flying skills and for the use of night-vision goggles, or NVGs. To accommodate that, the flight was taking off an hour and 20 minutes after sunset.\n\nBoth pilots wore AN/AVS-6(V)3 Night Vision Goggles, which look like opera glasses and clip onto the front of a pilot’s helmet. They gather ambient light, whether from the moon or stars or from man-made sources; intensify it; and display it through the lens of each element. The eyepiece doesn’t sit directly on the face but about an inch away, so the pilot can look down under it and see the instrument panel.\n\nNight-vision goggles have a narrow field of view, just 40 degrees compared to the 200-degree range of normal vision, which makes it harder for pilots to maintain full situational awareness. They have to pay attention to obstacles and other aircraft outside the window, and they also have to keep track of what the gauges on the panel in front them are saying: how fast they’re going, for instance, and how high. There’s a lot to process, and time is of the essence when you’re zooming along at 120 mph while lower than the tops of nearby buildings. To help with situational awareness, Eaves and Lobach were accompanied by a crew chief, Staff Sergeant Ryan O’Hara, sitting in a seat just behind the cockpit, where he would be able to help keep an eye out for trouble.\n\nThe helicopter turned to the south as it climbed, then flew along the eastern shore of the Potomac until the point where the river makes a big bend to the east. Eaves banked to the right and headed west toward the commuter suburb of Vicksburg, where the lights of house porches and street lamps seemed to twinkle as they fell in and out of the cover of the bare tree branches.\n\nPAT 25 followed the serpentine course of the Rapidan River through the hills and farm fields of the Piedmont. At this point, Eaves was not only the pilot in command, but also the pilot flying, meaning that he had his hands on the controls that guide the aircraft’s speed and direction and his feet on the rudder pedals that keep the helicopter “in trim” — that is, lined up with its direction of flight. Lobach played a supporting role, working the radio, keeping an eye out for obstacles and other traffic, and figuring out their location by referencing visible landmarks.\n\nLobach, 28, had been a pilot for four years. She’d been an ROTC cadet at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which she graduated from in 2019. Both her parents were doctors; she’d dreamed of a medical career but eventually realized that she couldn’t pursue one in the Army. According to her roommate, “She did not have a huge, massive passion” for aviation but chose it because it was the closest she could get to practicing medicine, under the circumstances. “She badly wanted to be a Black Hawk pilot because she wanted to be a medevac unit,” he told NTSB investigators. After she completed flight training at Fort Rucker, she was stationed at Fort Belvoir, where she joined the 12th Aviation Battalion and was put in charge of the oil-and-lubricants unit. One fellow pilot in the unit described her to the NTSB as “incredibly professional, very diligent and very thorough.”\n\nIn addition to her official duties, Lobach served as a volunteer social liaison at the White House, where she regularly represented the Army at Medal of Honor ceremonies and state dinners. She was both a fitness fanatic and a baker, known for providing fresh sourdough bread to her unit. She had started dabbling in real-estate investments and looked forward to moving in with her boyfriend of one year, another Army pilot with whom she talked about having “lots and lots of babies.” She was planning to leave the service in 2027 and had already applied for medical school at Mount Sinai. Helicopter flying was not something she intended to pursue.\n\nThough talented as a manager, she wasn’t much of a pilot. Helicopter flying is an extremely demanding feat of coordination and balance, akin to juggling and riding a unicycle at the same time. For Lobach, the difficulty was compounded by the fact that she had trained on highly automated, relatively easy-to-fly helicopters at Fort Rucker and then been assigned to an older aircraft, the Black Hawk L or “Lima” model, at Fort Belvoir. Unlike newer models, which can maintain their altitude on autopilot, the Lima requires constant care and attention, and Lobach struggled to master it. One instructor described her skills as “well below average,” noting that she had “lots of difficulties in the aircraft.” Three years before, she’d failed the night-vision evaluation she was taking tonight.\n\nBefore the flight, Eaves had told his girlfriend that he was concerned about Lobach’s capability as a pilot and that, skill-wise, she was “not where she should be.”\n\nIt’s not uncommon for pilots to struggle during the early phase of their career. But Lobach’s development had been particularly slow. In her five years in the service, she had accumulated just 454 hours of flight time, and she wasn’t clocking more very quickly. The Army requires officers in her role to fly at least 60 hours a year, but in the past 12 months, she’d flown only 56.7. Her superiors had made an exception for her because in March she’d had knee surgery for a sports injury, preventing her from flying for three months. The waiver made her technically qualified to fly, but it didn’t change the fact that she was rustier than pilots were normally allowed to become.\n\nIf she’d been keen on flying, she could have used every moment of this flight to hone her skills by taking the controls herself. But she was content to let Eaves do the flying during the first part of the trip.\n\nDrawing near to Greenhouse Airport, a small, private grass runway near a plant nursery, they navigated via an old-fashioned technique called pilotage, using landmarks and dead reckoning to find their way from point to point. Coming in for their first landing of the night, they were looking for the airstrip’s signature greenhouse complex.\n\nLobach: That large lit building may be part of it.\n\nEaves: It does look like a greenhouse, doesn’t it?\n\nLobach: Yeah, it does, doesn’t it? We can start slowing back.\n\nEaves: All right, slowing back.\n\nAs they circled around the runway, Eaves commented that the lighting of the greenhouse building was so intense that it was blinding in the NVGs, and Lobach agreed. Eaves positioned the helicopter a few hundred feet above the landing zone and asked Lobach to show him where it was. After she did so correctly, he told her to take the controls. This process followed a formalized set of acknowledgements to make sure that both parties understood who was in control of the aircraft.\n\nEaves: You’ve got the flight controls.\n\nAs Lobach eased the helicopter toward the ground, Eaves and Crew Chief O’Hara called out times from the landing checklist.\n\nO’Hara: Clear of obstacles on the left.\n\nLobach: Thank you. Coming forward.\n\nThey touched down. One minute and 42 seconds after passing control to Lobach, Eaves took it back again. As they sat on the ground with their rotor whirring, they discussed the fuel remaining aboard the aircraft and the direction they would travel in during the next segment of their flight. Finally, after six minutes, Eaves signaled that they were ready to take off again.\n\nEaves: Whenever you’re ready, ma’am.\n\nEaves’s deference to Lobach was symptomatic of what is known among psychologists as an “inverted authority gradient.” Although he was the pilot in command, both responsible for the flight and in a position of authority over others on it, Eaves held a lesser rank than Lobach and so in a broader context was her subordinate. In moments of high stress, this ambiguity can muddy the waters as to who is supposed to be making crucial decisions.\n\nEaves, Lobach, and O’Hara ran through their checklists, and Eaves eased the Black Hawk up into the night sky.\n\nThey headed north, bending to the east to avoid Culpeper Airport to their left. The scattering of lights beneath them was sparse as they passed over the rural foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Cruising at an altitude of 2,000 feet, the aircraft hit rough air.\n\nIt was a complaint Lobach continued to make throughout the night. A cold front was moving through the area, bringing winds that gusted up to 45 mph. The wind wasn’t dangerous, but it kept pushing the aircraft off its flight path and caused constant unexpected jerks. It was another stress factor in a night that already had plenty.\n\nTwo minutes later, Lobach declared that she was taking control of the aircraft. Eaves sounded surprised.\n\nLobach: I got the flight controls.\n\nEaves: Yup, you got flight controls.\n\nEaves: You do have flight controls. Sorry about that.\n\nLobach pointed out that they had descended below their intended altitude of 2,000 feet and were now at 1,600 feet. Eaves was confused, then realized that he had misread the altimeter display.\n\nThe fact that Eaves would make such a mistake is a reminder that, while he was a much more experienced and proficient pilot than Lobach, he, too, was a pilot with less than a thousand hours of flight time. In order to even start a career as an airline pilot in the U.S., you need a minimum of 1,500 hours.\n\nThe 12th Aviation Battalion is an elite unit with a glamorous and high-stakes mission: flying government officials and VIPs around in the nation’s capital. A decade ago, it was staffed by experienced aviators who would build flight time elsewhere before being transferred to the unit. But in recent years, it had begun accepting pilots straight out of flight school. “The unit is strapped for resources,” Lobach’s roommate told the NTSB. “They have struggled with staffing issues in general.”\n\nSimilar problems exist throughout Army aviation; the service has been having a hard time retaining its most experienced pilots and providing adequate flight time for those currently coming up through the ranks. Since 2011, the average number of hours flown per year by crewed Army aircraft has fallen from 302 to 198.\n\nLobach continued to fret about the wind, while Eaves seemed unfazed.\n\nLobach: Strong headwind right now.\n\nLobach: Uh, pretty strong headwind.\n\nShe pointed out that even though the airspeed indicator had the helicopter moving at 110 knots, the GPS was showing their groundspeed as 93 knots, implying a headwind of 17 knots or 20 mph.\n\nAfter Lobach again commented on how choppy the conditions were, Eaves took control back, just a minute and 48 seconds after he had relinquished it. In the first hour of flying time, Lobach had been operating the controls for a total of three and a half minutes.\n\nPAT 25 was skirting the edge of the busy restricted airspace around Dulles and Reagan, a three-dimensional imaginary blob 90 miles across with corridors cut through at low altitudes for helicopter traffic. It’s a complicated and busy environment that encompasses three major airports and three military airbases and is patrolled by military helicopters from three different branches of the military. Some transport VIPs, others hunt and intercept drones and aircraft that shouldn’t be in this highly sensitive space.\n\nTo be clear, there was no need for PAT 25 to be messing around in this airspace. All Lobach needed to do on this flight was demonstrate her proficiency with night-vision goggles and her skill at operating the aircraft. They could have done everything in the much quieter region around Greenhouse Airport, and other flight instructors routinely did. “I would go kind of west and south, for the most part,” says Austin Roth, a former instructor pilot in the 12th Aviation Battalion who flew with Eaves and even once gave him a check ride. “That was my preference.”\n\nAs they passed over the Civil War battlefield of Thoroughfare Gap, an alarm called a master caution went off, indicating that a control system for a tail fin was malfunctioning. If the situation worsened and the surface became stuck, the helicopter could crash. Lobach immediately started to run an emergency checklist. To their relief, they were able to reset the system without difficulty.\n\nOnce everything was sorted out, Eaves took a moment to critique her performance.\n\nEaves: “So how’s that supposed to look, ma’am?”\n\nLobach: “That EP [emergency checklist]?\n\nLobach realized that in her haste to resolve the issue, she’d skipped a preliminary step: pulling out a document called the flight reference card (FRC) and reading the action steps from it directly, rather than relying on memory.\n\nEaves: Yup. So, I mean, that’s the whole point of the FRC cards, right, is to get us away from doing those things automatically … ’cause we end up killing ourselves because we do something without confirming and verifying …\n\nLobach: Okay, thank you, yeah, you’re absolutely right. I sometimes forget that.\n\nSoon after, Lobach complained of lightheadedness.\n\nLobach: I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling a little dizzy, like, looking down and around with the winds or whatever it is, but not too bad.\n\nEaves: Roger. It is definitely windy. But a beautiful night other than that.\n\nThey were now at their maximum distance to the north from their home airfield at Fort Davison. To get back, they could either return the way they came, flying south and then east, or go the other way around Dulles and Reagan by flying east and then south. Doing the latter would necessitate cutting through the busiest part of the whole Washington airspace, using the river routes that thread between Reagan National Airport and the National Mall.\n\nThat’s what Eaves chose to do. As they were turning east, Lobach decided that she was ready to fly the helicopter.\n\nLobach: Would you be up for me flying for a little while?\n\nEaves: Yup, by all means, ma’am.\n\nTheir next landing spot was a helipad located at the Federal Support Center, an underground facility located at a former Nike missile-launch site in Olney, Maryland. As they drew near, Eaves prepped Lobach for their arrival. As usual, they would fly to a pre-chosen waypoint, known as a release point (RP), then decelerate and descend to a touchdown in the landing zone. Now that the wind was at their back, it was pushing them to a higher groundspeed than their airspeed, meaning that they had less time to plan and react as they maneuvered for landing.\n\nEaves: All right, you’re 1.4 [kilometers] to your RP.\n\nLobach: Okay. Slow down, come down a bit. Wow, that’s wild! I’m slowing down and still at a hundred knots ground.\n\nEaves: 0.7 [kilometers]. What’s your RP?\n\nLobach: Um, I’m sorry — what do you mean, “What was it?”\n\nEaves: All right, what am I looking for on the ground?\n\nLobach: Um, I can’t remember, I have to look at my notes.\n\nEaves told her not to worry about her notes, which told her how to visually identify their landing spot, and instead to simply follow her navigational instruments, which had been programmed with the waypoint’s coordinates.\n\nAs they descended, Eaves and O’Hara called out items on the pre-landing checklist. Lobach commented that she could feel the strong, gusty wind pushing on the left side of the aircraft. Both she and Eaves were scanning ahead, looking for the helipad amid the trees and buildings below them. Eaves spotted it first, then Lobach. But as she maneuvered to come in for a landing to the north, she lost track of it.\n\nEaves: Remember, there is a fence on the north side of this pad.\n\nLobach: Yeah. Thank you … probably still coming in a little too fast. Not so bad. See that big tree on the right? Am I clear of that?\n\nSuddenly, the landing was not looking so good, and Eaves told her to abort.\n\nEaves: Go around! Go around! Go around!\n\nLobach added power and climbed away from the terrain. As she did, building airspeed, she put the helicopter into a banked turn.\n\nEaves: Are you going — which way are you going, ma’am?\n\nLobach: I was going to go right, sorry, do you want me to go left?\n\nEaves: I think it would probably be better, because you’re turning into the wind, right?\n\nThe idea of a go-around is to climb in order to come around and try landing again, but Lobach was starting to feel sketched out.\n\nLobach: I’m not sure I’m, I’m —\n\nLobach: This doesn’t feel right.\n\nEaves: Yup. You’re good. Feels like you’re getting your ass kicked with some wind to the left, right?\n\nEaves: So go ahead and start your approach.\n\nEaves coached her to add power and get the aircraft back in position to try landing again.\n\nLobach: Yeah, I — I’m not comfortable landing there.\n\nLobach: I’m clearing out. I probably could, but — it’s handling funny.\n\nEaves: All right. Mind if I give it a shot?\n\nEaves took the controls and landed the helicopter. On the ground, he talked her through how to handle the tricky winds and offered her a chance to try again.\n\nLobach: Yeah, honestly — I, uh, when we got to the … at that point, that’s probably, like, where I was like, Yeah, I don’t want to do this, ’cause I can’t really see it, like maybe I need to be higher in my chair or something, but I kind of lost any … Yeah, I’m good with the demonstration.\n\nEaves had no objections, and they decided to head back to base. By failing to complete the maneuver as requested, Lobach had effectively failed the check ride. Once back at their home base, Eaves would have to give her a rating of “unsatisfactory,” and Lobach would be put on training status until she was able to demonstrate the necessary proficiency.\n\nBut as they continued their mission, neither mentioned that fact.\n\nTheir course south took them across the wealthy Maryland suburbs of Bethesda and Cabin John, passing over golf courses, nature preserves, and tracts of expensive homes as they headed for the Potomac.\n\nFour minutes after takeoff, perhaps to show that she was not intimidated by the aircraft, Lobach again asked to take the controls. She would have them for the rest of the flight.\n\nPilots who are rusty or lack experience do not have the muscle memory that more skilled pilots possess. When too much information is flooding in at once, they are unable to process it all and become what psychologists call “task saturated.” Among aviators, the condition is known as being “behind the plane.” In this state pilots, are unable to plan ahead to anticipate problems. They respond reactively or simply miss cues altogether. They are not, in other words, fully in control of the aircraft.\n\nReaching the Potomac again at Cabin John, she was too high — 1,400 feet instead of the max altitude of 1,300 — and turned right instead of left, nearly putting the helicopter into forbidden airspace. Rather than taking control of the aircraft back from her, Eaves gently teased her. She pulled a 180, descending as she entered Route 1, a flight corridor along the Potomac’s northern shore.\n\nYou could think of these D.C. helicopter routes as tunnels through the otherwise forbidden airspace. They have a defined ceiling that gets lower and lower as you get closer to the center of the city but no defined lateral boundaries; instead, pilots are instructed to follow the bank of the river. That may seem a little vague, but pilots understand how to do it.\n\n“When I flew those routes, especially at night, I always flew them right on the bank,” says Tim Lilley, a former Army pilot who operated Black Hawks in the D.C. metro area. “One of the reasons is it’s very much easier to tell if you’re gaining or losing altitude, looking at trees and rocks and whatever is on the bank, as opposed to looking at water. If you’re looking at water, there’s no contrast, so you don’t know if you’re climbing or descending unless you look at your instruments. It’s a very bad idea to fly just flat over water at 200 feet, because you’re going to have to spend a lot of time looking inside to make sure you’re at the right altitude. You could very quickly lose 200 feet and end up in the drink.”\n\nAs she flew down the river, Lobach was clearly struggling to stay in control of the aircraft. Eaves nudged her to keep the helicopter in trim and to find the correct altitude.\n\nAt 8:43, as they passed one of the most sensitive and restricted airspaces in the world — the vice-president’s residence at the Naval Observatory — Lobach again complained about the turbulence.\n\nLobach: Getting choppy close to the ground.\n\nEaves: Oh yeah, down low it’s definitely gonna get choppy.\n\nLobach: Yeah. We’re at 300 [feet altitude].\n\nThat was not correct, as Eaves indirectly reminded her.\n\nLobach descended, but the ceiling of the corridor was decreasing as well, so she needed to come down further still.\n\nEaves: All right, there’s 300 for 200.\n\nBut she was not at 200 feet. As she passed the Lincoln Memorial, she was above 300 feet and, in fact, had begun climbing. She had also let the aircraft get out of trim, so that the helicopter was flying somewhat sideways to the wind. Novice pilots who are fixated on one of the numerous aspects of their flight — altitude, location, speed, communication with air-traffic control — can easily lose track of the trim. But it’s an important part of good airmanship, especially during turns.\n\nSouth of the Lincoln Memorial, the helicopter route bends east to cross the Tidal Basin and follows a side branch, the Washington Channel, which is occupied by a small marina. Staying on track required a sharp turn to the left.\n\nEaves: Lots of right pedal, ma’am.\n\nEaves: There we go, now we can make the turn.\n\nHe noticed that, in the process of getting the helicopter to fly straight, she had lost track of her altitude and gotten too high again.\n\nEaves: You’re at 300 feet. Come down for me.\n\nLobach stopped climbing and brought the helicopter into a sharp, short descent, but still remained above the route ceiling.\n\nAs PAT 25 was working its way southeast along Route 1, a regional jet inbound from Wichita was coming up the river from the south, heading for runway 33 at Reagan. Operated by a subsidiary of American Airlines, PSA Airlines flight 5342 was a Bombardier CRJ700 with four crewmembers and 60 passengers, including a group of teenage figure skaters, coaches, and parents returning from the national figure-skating championships.\n\nPAT 25’s path along the east bank of the Potomac would take it right under the designated flight path for jets landing on runway 33. Technically, if neither the helicopter nor the plane deviated from its assigned route, they would pass each other safely, but the margin was so small — just 75 feet at the point of closest approach — that the air-traffic controller at Reagan’s tower called PAT 25 to alert it.\n\nReagan Tower: PAT 25, traffic just south of Wilson Bridge is a CRJ at 1,200 feet for runway 33.\n\nThe primary job of an air-traffic controller is to keep aircraft from colliding. Given that two aircraft on the controller’s screen were now on a converging course, it was crucial to ensure that their paths did not intersect. A commonly used option was to hold southbound helicopter traffic at Hains Point, where the Washington Channel rejoins the main channel of the Potomac, until the landing plane had passed. Instead, Eaves assured the tower that he could see the incoming flight and asked for permission to stay clear of it under his own cognizance.\n\nEaves: PAT 25 has the traffic in sight. Request visual separation.\n\nReagan Tower: Separation approved.\n\nEaves did not have PSA 5342 in sight. As he looked to the south, the airliner would have appeared as one of a string of bright-white dots strung above the horizon. Some commentators have speculated that Eaves had another aircraft in sight, which he mistakenly believed to be PSA 5342. But it may have been that he didn’t have any aircraft in sight at all. During an interview with NTSB investigators, Army Chief Warrant Officer David Van Vechten testified that it was common practice for pilots in the 12th Aviation Battalion to say that they had the traffic in sight even when they didn’t, so that the tower would give them the visual separation clearance. “I’ve done that,” Van Vechten said. “I know if I don’t say it, I may have to hold.”\n\nAs they approached Hains Point, Eaves noted that the wind was pushing them, from behind and from the side, toward the eastern bank. To stay on course, Lobach would have to counteract that push by angling the helicopter to the right.\n\nLobach: Crabbing … better not to fight the wind. Right pedal.\n\nFifty seconds later, PAT 25 rejoined the main channel of the Potomac at Hains Point. The lights of Reagan Airport lay a half mile to the right. The PSA flight was a mile and a half away, dead ahead, on a converging course, and closing at a speed of more than 200 mph.\n\nIn the aftermath of the crash, investigators focused on the staffing level at the Reagan tower, concerned that an overburdened controller had mistakenly allowed the aircraft to converge, but the transcript shows that the close approach of the jet and the helicopter was front-of-mind for him. As the distance between the aircraft closed, he checked in with the Black Hawk.\n\nReagan Tower: PAT 25, you have the CRJ in sight? PAT 25 pass behind the CRJ.\n\nEaves: PAT 25 has aircraft in sight. Request visual separation.\n\nReagan Tower: Visual separation.\n\nFlying south from Hains Point, Lobach should have eased to the left to join the bank of the Potomac. Instead, she headed straight down the center of the river. Out here over the water, the river was just a black void. The only way to gauge how high she was was to look at the altimeter inside the cockpit. But that meant not looking outside at what was in front of her.\n\nLikely, she was still task saturated: trying to keep the helicopter at the right altitude, and along the right path, while wrestling with turbulence and a gusty wind that was pushing her toward the river bank on her left, all while wearing night-vision goggles that blocked her peripheral vision and overwhelmed her eyes with too much light. In this environment, with all the lights of the city around her, it would actually have been much easier to see with the goggles off, but that would have defeated the purpose of the mission.\n\nIn a word, Lobach was flailing. Eaves was as well, too distracted by his runaway student pilot to pay attention to what was happening outside the cockpit.\n\nEaves: All right, kinda come left for me, ma’am. I think that’s why he’s asking.\n\nLobach did not turn toward the eastern bank.\n\nAt 8:47:57.7, the helicopter’s black box recorded Lobach making a “sound similar to mumbling.”\n\nThe Blackhawk helicopter was flying at an altitude of 278 feet and a speed of 120 mph. It was both too far out from the riverbank and too high, which put it squarely in the path of the CRJ descending at 128 mph.\n\nOne second before impact, the CRJ’s flight crew tried to pull the airplane up. The helicopter’s main rotor hit the nose and engines of the airliner, triggering a fireball, and the commingled wreckage fell vertically into the Potomac River. The impact would have been unsurvivable for anyone onboard.\n\nWhat Lobach faced on the final night of her life was a mission that was far beyond her skill level. She was a low-proficiency pilot with a low aptitude for flying, one who didn’t fly regularly in an operational role and had no intention of flying after leaving the service. She was operating a helicopter that was older, less automated, and more challenging than what she’d trained on. Her instructor pilot had been warned to keep a tight rein on her during the flight but had failed to do so.\n\nAs the pilot in command, Eaves bears personal responsibility for what happened. But responsibility was not his alone. The crash was also a product of a dysfunctional system. For years, the Army air-accident rate has been climbing, as aviators complain that they are not being given enough flight time to maintain adequate levels of skill.\n\n“Across a lot of Army aviation units … what we’re seeing is that composite cockpit time is steadily going down and down and down,” said NTSB Chairman Jennifer Homendy during a hearing into the accident. “Five years ago, we would have thousands of hours cockpit. Now, we have hundreds and hundreds of hours cockpit … Experience across aviation formations is steadily decreasing.”\n\nIt’s striking that this decrease is even being felt at the 12th Aviation Battalion, whose mission is to transport the legislators who make Defense spending decisions and the Pentagon brass who implement those decisions. You’d think that they’d want their lives entrusted to only the most skilled pilots. The fate of PAT 25 shows that the unit can’t even be trusted to transport itself. “At her flight time of 460-something hours, if you’re not flying once a week, you are not proficient,” says Tim Lilley, the former Army Black Hawk pilot. “Certainly not proficient enough to fly high-ranking officials.” Yet the Army considered Lobach qualified to do just that.\n\nAfter Lilley retired from the military, he became an airline pilot, and eventually his son Samuel became an airline pilot, too. Samuel Lilley was serving as the first officer of PSA 5342 on the night of January 29, 2025. In the year since his death Tim has been on a mission to change the Army’s approach so that tragedies like this don’t happen again.\n\n“It was an embarrassment to Army aviation,” he says. “And you know, I still proudly wear my Army wings. But there’s a lot of things that have to be addressed.”\n\nOne thing he’d like to see happen is for the Army to establish a rigorous safety-reporting system of the kind that’s standard in commercial aviation. Another is to make sure that pilots get enough flying time to be proficient, even if that means taking staff officers off the roster entirely. “They have 14,000 active pilots. And I said to the Army Chief of Staff, ‘Wouldn’t you rather have 11,000 proficient pilots, rather than 14,000 pilots that are barely getting minimums?’”\n\nHe knows that it will be a hard journey to get there. Cultures don’t change easily. But a son’s death is a powerful motivator. As for Eaves and Lobach, he doesn’t blame them for his son’s death. He thinks that Lobach could have become a good pilot if they gave her another thousand hours of flying time. Instead, the Army withheld from her the training and flight time that she needed to fly safely and then required her to go fly anyway on a mission that was as ill-conceived as it was poorly executed.\n\n“There was no reason for them to be there,” he says. “This was a bad idea. A bad plan from the get-go.”",

    "description": "how we used math, reinforcement learning, and social engineering to build a universal rhythm game cheat, climb to top 20 worldwide, and get banned without ever being detected.",
    "fullText": "using math and reinforcement learning, we built a cheat that works on literally every VSRG - osu!mania, etterna, quaver, stepmania, you name it. no game-specific code. just math and a trained model that learned to read scrolling notes and output perfectly timed keystrokes.\n\nit worked too well. top 20 worldwide on osu!, then banned. even funnier than that, they still had no proof the scores were cheated, and could only ban us for multi-accounting suspicions.\n\nthe best part? we social-engineered our way into the community so hard that top 100 players were vouching for us being legit. people analyzed our replays and said “yeah this looks human.” whilst we never even pressed a single key.\n\nthis is the story of how we spent a weekend building something we probably shouldn’t have, got way better results than we expected, and confirmed that the hardest part of cheating isn’t fooling the software, it’s fooling the people.\n\nit started as a joke. “what if we made a bot that could play osu!mania?” turned into “what if it worked on every rhythm game?” which turned into “what if we actually tried to rank?” which turned into high ranked accounts in every rhythm game, a top 20 global ranking, friendships with players who had no idea they were befriending a python script, and eventually a ban that proved we’d done our job almost too well.\n\nwe’re not releasing the code. we’re not here to help you cheat. we’re here because these were really interesting technical and sociological problems we’ve worked on, and the intersection of math, machine learning, reverse engineering, and straight-up social engineering is too good not to document.\n\nalso, statute of limitations on internet drama is like 6 months… right?\n\nVSRG stands for Vertical Scrolling Rhythm Game. if you’ve ever played guitar hero, dance dance revolution, or beatmania, then you’ve played a VSRG. notes fall from the top of the screen, you press the corresponding key when they hit the bottom. simple.\n\nthe competitive scene is… not simple.\n\ngames like osu!mania, etterna, quaver, and stepmania have global leaderboards, ranked play, and communities that take timing accuracy and legitimacy very seriously. we’re talking millisecond-level precision. the difference between a “marvelous” and a “perfect” hit can be 16ms. the difference between top 100 and top 1000 is consistency across thousands of notes.\n\nhere’s the thing that made this project possible: every VSRG is fundamentally the same problem.\n\nnotes scroll down. you press keys. the visual style changes. between games, it can be stylized as arrows, circles, bars, whatever… but the underlying mechanic is identical! timing windows vary, scoring formulas differ, but the core loop is:\n\nwhich means if you can solve this problem once, mathematically, you can solve it for every game in the genre.\n\nthis seems like an easy problem to solve.. right? well, not exactly.\n\n“just OCR the screen and press keys lol”\n\ntechnically, this fails for a few reasons:\n\nwe tried this first. it was bad. like, worse than average bad.\n\nbut here’s the thing most people don’t realize: even if your bot plays perfectly, you still lose.\n\nosu! has actual anti-cheat software, sure. (albeit old, you can still see some of vmfunc and pushfq’s research on their ac here) but the real threat isn’t their anti-cheat really, it’s the community.\n\never heard of r/osureport? it’s a subreddit dedicated entirely to hunting cheaters. thousands of players spending their free time analyzing replays, tracking improvement curves, comparing timing distributions, and writing detailed reports on anyone who looks suspicious.\n\nthey have spreadsheets. they have bots that automate report tracking. they categorize cheats by type: relax hacks, timewarp, macros, aim assist, multi-account, and whatnot. they track ban statuses. it’s genuinely impressive how organized they are at ruining cheaters’ days.\n\nand it’s not just reddit. set a good or a top score on a ranked map and you’ll have people in your DMs within hours. “hey nice score, can you stream it?” “your UR is crazy consistent, what’s your setup?” “I noticed your improvement curve is insane, how long have you been playing?”\n\nevery replay is public. every score can be downloaded and frame-by-frame analyzed. people will literally overlay your cursor movements on top of known cheaters to look for patterns. they’ll run statistical analysis on your hit timing distributions. they’ll compare your offline vs online performance.\n\nthe osu! community has mass-reported accounts into bans purely based on “this doesn’t feel right.” no concrete proof, just collective suspicion. and staff often listens.\n\nso the real challenge isn’t just “play the notes correctly.” it’s:\n\nthis is why most cheats get caught. not because the software detected them but because a bored 16 year old with too much free time noticed something was off. or because you beat the score of another top player who took the piss.\n\nso how do we even achieve this?\n\nthe notes are deterministic. the chart is the chart. if you know the scroll speed and the current timestamp, you can mathematically derive where every note will be at any moment.\n\nthis is just calculus. and a little signal processing.\n\nbut wait… remember the human problem? pure math gives you perfect inputs. perfect inputs get you banned in 24 hours.\n\nhere’s where it gets interesting. osu! lets you download replays. any replay. from anyone. including the top 50 players in the world.\n\nso we did exactly that. we scraped thousands of replays from top 100 players across different skill brackets. not just their best plays, their mediocre ones too. the ones where they choked. the ones where they were warming up. the ones at 3am when they were using different setups and keyboards.\n\nfrom each replay, we extracted:\n\nturns out humans are incredibly consistent in their inconsistency. top players don’t just have better accuracy but they actually have signature error patterns. you shouldn’t interpret their timing distributions as random noise, they’re actually shaped by muscle memory, fatigue, and playstyle.\n\nso in theory, if you can mimick that, while also mimicking a natural pattern of improving after playing a chart over and over again, or choking every now and then, you’re basically just a human to the external eye.\n\nwe now had a dataset of what “legitimate top player” actually looks like, statistically. the goal wasn’t to play perfectly but it was to play exactly like a human would if that human had god-tier reflexes.\n\nalright, let’s get into the actual implementation.\n\nwe sample single pixels at the hit zone for each column. for a 4-key layout, that’s 4 regions:\n\neach frame, we capture these 1x1 pixel regions and check if a note is present via color matching:\n\nsimple color thresholding with a tolerance of ~3. works surprisingly well across different skins as long as you calibrate the target colors.\n\nhere’s where it gets interesting. we track KPS (keys per second) in real-time and use it to dynamically adjust timing variance:\n\nhumans get less consistent when playing faster. so we scale deviance with KPS:\n\nat low KPS (slow sections), timing is tight and consistent. at high KPS (dense streams), variance increases. this matches how real players behave, obviously you can’t maintain perfect consistency at 20+ KPS.\n\nlong notes get different treatment though, smaller deviance on press/release because humans are actually more consistent with holds:\n\npure math gets you accuracy. but leaderboards also care about:\n\nuniform random distribution doesn’t look human. humans have biased error distributions, they tend to hit slightly early or slightly late depending on playstyle, and errors cluster in patterns.\n\nwe had thousands of replays. we had a working bot. now we needed to make them talk to each other.\n\nwe framed this as a policy optimization problem. the agent’s job, given a note timing, had to output a delay that maximizes “human-likeness” while staying within scoring windows.\n\nthe perfection_penalty was crucial. without it, the agent learned to hit perfect timings every time, which is exactly what gets you reported.\n\nfor each replay in our dataset, we extracted:\n\nthis gave us ~2 million training samples across different skill levels, playstyles, and song difficulties.\n\nmodel wise it’s nothing fancy, a small feedforward network (3 hidden layers, 128 units each) that outputs mean and variance for a gaussian distribution. we sample from that distribution to get the actual delay.\n\ntrained with PPO for ~500k steps. the loss curves were boring (good sign) and the final policy produced timing distributions that were statistically indistinguishable from our reference players.\n\nwe generated 1000 synthetic replays and compared their timing distributions against real replays using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. p-values > 0.05 for all columns and KPS brackets.\n\nin english (for the non math nerds out there) if you looked at a histogram of our bot’s timing errors vs a real player’s timing errors, you couldn’t tell them apart.\n\nhere’s what it looks like in action:\n\ngame 1 uses arrow skins. game 2 uses circles. game 3 uses bars. game 4 uses rectangles. who cares?\n\nthe core engine doesn’t change. the humanizer doesn’t change. the only thing that changes per-game is:\n\nwe built a simple config system. point it at a new game, calibrate the detection regions, tweak the timing parameters, done. same bot, different skin.\n\ntested on: osu!mania, etterna, quaver, stepmania, malody, even roblox, and a few others we probably shouldn’t name. worked on all of them.\n\nwith a working bot and a humanizer that passed statistical tests, it was time to see how far we could push it.\n\nwe spent around ~5000 dollars on accounts on various games, osu!, etterna, quaver, roblox, you name it.\n\nthe last one was the hardest. we couldn’t just jump from unranked to top 100 in a week. so we tried two different routes.\n\nthe first one, scripting a fake improvement curve start with easier maps, gradually increase difficulty, occasionally plateau, sometimes regress slightly. just like a real player learning the game.\n\nthe second one, directly jumping to insane ranks and using our profiles in other games to prove our legitimacy and claim that we came from other games, since skills are transferrable.\n\nwe even made the bot “practice” maps. play the same song multiple times with slightly improving scores each time. leave realistic gaps between sessions. take breaks on weekends.\n\nfirst it was top 10,000. then top 5,000. then top 1,000. every milestone felt surreal. we were watching a program outperform thousands of real humans who had spent years developing their skills.\n\nat this point on some games like roblox, people started noticing. “what’s your practice routine” “can you stream sometime”\n\nwe couldn’t stream, obviously. so we made excuses. bad internet. anxiety. broken webcam. the community bought it. they had no reason not to.\n\nwe were in the leaderboards next to players we’d watched for years. players whose replays we’d scraped to train our bot were now competing against that same bot. the irony wasn’t lost on us lol\n\ntop 100 players vouched for us. people analyzed our replays frame-by-frame and said “yeah i mean this looks legit”. at some point on quaver someone even invited us to a tournament. we politely declined (scheduling conflicts, yk…)\n\nwe were living a double life. and honestly? it was kind of exhausting.\n\nhere’s the thing: we didn’t really get caught. not in the way you’d expect.\n\nout of all the accounts across all the games, only two osu! accounts got banned. the rest? still standing. etterna, quaver, the roblox games? all still up. we’ll be manually deleting them now that this post is out, since that was always the plan once the experiment was over.\n\nso what happened with those two osu! accounts?\n\nwe got cocky. we started sniping top players. taking their #1s on maps they cared about. that’s when people started paying attention.\n\nthe thing is, we had a cover story ready: “i’m coming from etterna/quaver, just switched to osu!mania.” this is actually a legitimate thing that happens, as players migrate between VSRGs all the time, and their skills transfer. it’s not suspicious to be good at osu!mania if you’ve been grinding etterna for years.\n\nwe even got top players to vouch for us. showed them our replays, chatted with them about technique, talked about our “background” in other games. claimed we were specifically good at X or Y playstyle, some analyzed our scores and said “yeah this tracks, the skillset transfers”… social engineering at its finest.\n\nsince both of us actually knew how to play VSRGs, we could handle conversations with top players just fine without struggling to use terminology or knowing things only good players would know.\n\nand here’s our strongest argument: we couldn’t possibly be cheating in EVERY game.\n\nthe community’s logic was simple, there are no publicly available cheats that work across osu!, etterna, quaver, AND roblox rhythm games. surely if someone was cheating, they’d only be cheating in one game? the idea of a universal VSRG cheat seemed absurd. “there’s no way someone has a cheat for all of them”\n\nturns out we did. but nobody believed that was even possible.\n\nthe irony of this screenshot still kills us. “i just so happen to have a cheat that works on every game including quaver etterna osu roblox” said sarcastically, as if that’s an absurd claim. reader, it was not absurd. we had exactly that.\n\nbut here’s the thing about sniping top players: they get salty. and salty players report. a lot.\n\nthe anti-cheat never flagged us. our replays passed every statistical test the community threw at them. the timing distributions looked human. the persona was solid.\n\nwhat got us was the cockiness which led to a report. not with evidence (as all evidence they provided got disproven by other top players, including graphs!), just “this doesn’t feel right” from enough people that staff had to do something.\n\nthe official ban reason? multi-accounting and stolen account suspicion. not cheating. they couldn’t prove cheating because, statistically, there was nothing to prove. our replays were indistinguishable from human replays.\n\nthey knew something was off. too good, too fast, too many people complaining. but they couldn’t prove what.\n\nin the end, the cheat was never detected. the human behind it was just too annoying.\n\nand honestly? that felt like a win.\n\nrhythm games are a solved problem - mathematically, there’s nothing stopping a bot from achieving perfect play. the timing is deterministic, the inputs are simple.\n\nthe hard part is the human problem - anti-cheat software is easy to bypass. the community is not. thousands of players actively hunting for cheaters is a more effective deterrent than any automated system.\n\nstatistical humanization is surprisingly effective - with enough training data and the right model, you can generate behavior that’s indistinguishable from human behavior. scary implications beyond rhythm games.\n\nsocial engineering is underrated - half our success came from building a believable persona in various games. the technical cheat was good, but the social cover was what let us climb for months.\n\nwe spent way too much time on this - could’ve learned a real skill. instead we learned how to fake one. worth it? probably not. fun? absolutely.\n\nwe’re not releasing code and we’re not here to help people cheat.\n\nthis is documentation of an interesting technical problem! the intersection of signal processing, reinforcement learning, game hacking, and social engineering.\n\nthe rhythm game community will probably hate this post. fair honestly. and we’re sorry. but the problems we solved here have applications beyond cheating at video games: fraud detection, bot detection, behavioral biometrics, and much more! understanding how to fake human behavior helps you understand how to detect fake human behavior.\n\nalso we’re already banned and are going to delete all our other accounts used for testing. what are they gonna do, ban us again?\n\nwe built something that shouldn’t work as well as it did. we climbed higher than we expected. we made friends who weren’t real and rivals who didn’t know they were competing against code.\n\nin the end, we got caught not because the cheat failed, but because humans are better at detecting humans than software ever will be. the bot was perfect. the person it was pretending to be wasn’t convincing enough.\n\nthere’s probably a lesson in there somewhere.\n\nthanks for reading. don’t cheat at video games. it’s not worth it.\n\nbut if you’re going to do it anyway, at least do your own research, write your own stuff, and make it interesting",

    "description": "IPIDEA’s proxy infrastructure is a component of the digital ecosystem leveraged by a wide array of bad actors.",
    "fullText": "Visibility and context on the threats that matter most.\n\nThis week Google and partners took action to disrupt what we believe is one of the largest residential proxy networks in the world, the IPIDEA proxy network. IPIDEA’s proxy infrastructure is a little-known component of the digital ecosystem leveraged by a wide array of bad actors.\n\nThis disruption, led by Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) in partnership with other teams, included three main actions:\n\nTook legal action to take down domains used to control devices and proxy traffic through them.\n\nShared technical intelligence on discovered IPIDEA software development kits (SDKs) and proxy software with platform providers, law enforcement, and research firms to help drive ecosystem-wide awareness and enforcement. These SDKs, which are offered to developers across multiple mobile and desktop platforms, surreptitiously enroll user devices into the IPIDEA network. Driving collective enforcement against these SDKs helps protect users across the digital ecosystem and restricts the network's ability to expand.\n\nThese efforts to help keep the broader digital ecosystem safe supplement the protections we have to safeguard Android users on certified devices. We ensured Google Play Protect, Android’s built-in security protection, automatically warns users and removes applications known to incorporate IPIDEA SDKs, and blocks any future install attempts.\n\nWe believe our actions have caused significant degradation of IPIDEA’s proxy network and business operations, reducing the available pool of devices for the proxy operators by millions. Because proxy operators share pools of devices using reseller agreements, we believe these actions may have downstream impact across affiliated entities.\n\nIn contrast to other types of proxies, residential proxy networks sell the ability to route traffic through IP addresses owned by internet service providers (ISPs) and used to provide service to residential or small business customers. By routing traffic through an array of consumer devices all over the world, attackers can mask their malicious activity by hijacking these IP addresses. This generates significant challenges for network defenders to detect and block malicious activities.\n\nA robust residential proxy network requires the control of millions of residential IP addresses to sell to customers for use. IP addresses in countries such as the US, Canada, and Europe are considered especially desirable. To do this, residential proxy network operators need code running on consumer devices to enroll them into the network as exit nodes. These devices are either pre-loaded with proxy software or are joined to the proxy network when users unknowingly download trojanized applications with embedded proxy code. Some users may knowingly install this software on their devices, lured by the promise of “monetizing” their spare bandwidth. When the device is joined to the proxy network, the proxy provider sells access to the infected device’s network bandwidth (and use of its IP address) to their customers.\n\nWhile operators of residential proxies often extol the privacy and freedom of expression benefits of residential proxies, Google Threat Intelligence Group’s (GTIG) research shows that these proxies are overwhelmingly misused by bad actors. IPIDEA has become notorious for its role in facilitating several botnets: its software development kits played a key role in adding devices to the botnets, and its proxy software was then used by bad actors to control them. This includes the BadBox2.0 botnet we took legal action against last year, and the Aisuru and Kimwolf botnets more recently. We also observe IPIDEA being leveraged by a vast array of espionage, crime, and information operations threat actors. In a single seven day period in January 2026, GTIG observed over 550 individual threat groups that we track utilizing IP addresses tracked as IPIDEA exit nodes to obfuscate their activities, including groups from China, DPRK, Iran and Russia. The activities included access to victim SaaS environments, on-premises infrastructure, and password spray attacks. Our research has found significant overlaps between residential proxy network exit nodes, likely because of reseller and partnership agreements, making definitive quantification and attribution challenging.\n\nIn addition, residential proxies pose a risk to the consumers whose devices are joined to the proxy network as exit nodes. These users knowingly or unknowingly provide their IP address and device as a launchpad for hacking and other unauthorized activities, potentially causing them to be flagged as suspicious or blocked by providers. Proxy applications also introduce security vulnerabilities to consumers’ devices and home networks. When a user’s device becomes an exit node, network traffic that they do not control will pass through their device. This means bad actors can access a user’s private devices on the same network, effectively exposing security vulnerabilities to the internet. GTIG’s analysis of these applications confirmed that IPIDEA proxy did not solely route traffic through the exit node device, they also sent traffic to the device, in order to compromise it. While proxy providers may claim ignorance or close these security gaps when notified, enforcement and verification is challenging given intentionally murky ownership structures, reseller agreements, and diversity of applications.\n\nOur analysis of residential proxy networks found that many well-known residential proxy brands are not only related but are controlled by the actors behind IPIDEA. This includes the following ostensibly independent proxy and VPN brands:\n\nCherry Proxy (cherryproxy\\.com)\n\nThe same actors that control these brands also control several domains related to Software Development Kits (SDKs) for residential proxies. These SDKs are not meant to be installed or executed as standalone applications, rather they are meant to be embedded into existing applications. The operators market these kits as ways for developers to monetize their applications, and offer Android, Windows, iOS, and WebOS compatibility. Once developers incorporate these SDKs into their app, they are then paid by IPIDEA usually on a per-download basis.\n\nFigure 1: Advertising from PacketSDK, part of the IPIDEA proxy network\n\nOnce the SDK is embedded into an application, it will turn the device it is running on into an exit node for the proxy network in addition to providing whatever the primary functionality of the application was. These SDKs are the key to any residential proxy network—the software they get embedded into provides the network operators with the millions of devices they need to maintain a healthy residential proxy network.\n\nWhile many residential proxy providers state that they source their IP addresses ethically, our analysis shows these claims are often incorrect or overstated. Many of the malicious applications we analyzed in our investigation did not disclose that they enrolled devices into the IPIDEA proxy network. Researchers have previously found uncertified and off-brand Android Open Source Project devices, such as television set top boxes, with hidden residential proxy payloads.\n\nThe following SDKs are controlled by the same actors that control the IPIDEA proxy network:\n\nWe performed static and dynamic analysis on software that had SDK code embedded in it as well as standalone SDK files to identify the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure used to manage proxy exit nodes and route traffic through them. From the analysis we observed that EarnSDK, PacketSDK, CastarSDK, and HexSDK have significant overlaps in their C2 infrastructure as well as code structure.\n\nThe infrastructure model is a two-tier system:\n\nTier One: Upon startup, the device will choose from a set of domains to connect to. The device sends some diagnostic information to the Tier One server and receives back a data payload that includes a set of Tier Two nodes to connect to.\n\nTier Two: The application will communicate directly with an IP address to periodically poll for proxy tasks. When it receives a proxy task it will establish a new dedicated connection to the Tier Two IP address and begin proxying the payloads it receives.\n\nThe device diagnostic information can be sent as HTTP GET query string parameters or in the HTTP POST body, depending on the domain and SDK. The payload sent includes a key parameter, which may be a customer identifier used to determine who gets paid for the device enrollment.\n\nFigure 3: Sample device information send to Tier One server\n\nThe response from the Tier One server includes some timing information as well as the IP addresses of the Tier Two servers that this device should periodically poll for tasking.\n\nFigure 4: Sample response received from the Tier One Server\n\nThe Tier Two servers are sent as connect and proxy pairs. In all analyses the pairs have been IP addresses, not domains. In our analysis, the pairs are the same IP address but different ports. The connect port is used to periodically poll for new proxy tasking. This is performed by sending TCP packets with encoded JSON payloads.\n\nFigure 5: Sample encoded JSON sent to Tier Two connect port\n\nWhen the Tier Two server has traffic to route to the device, it will respond back with the FQDN to proxy traffic to as well as a connection ID.\n\nFigure 6: Sample proxy tasking from the Tier Two server\n\nThe device will then establish a connection to the proxy port of the same Tier Two server and send the connection ID, indicating that it is ready to receive data payloads.\n\nFigure 7: Sample data sent from device to the Tier Two proxy port\n\nThe Tier Two server will then immediately send data payloads to be proxied. The device will extract the TCP data payload, establish a socket connection to the specified FQDN and send the payload, unmodified, to the destination.\n\nThe SDKs each have their own set of Tier One domains. This comes primarily from analysis of standalone SDK files.\n\nhttp://{random}.api-seed.packetsdk\\.xyz\n\nhttp://{random}.api-seed.packetsdk\\.net\n\nhttp://{random}.api-seed.packetsdk\\.io\n\ncfe47df26c8eaf0a7c136b50c703e173\\.com\n\n8b21a945159f23b740c836eb50953818\\.com\n\n31d58c226fc5a0aa976e13ca9ecebcc8\\.com\n\nDownload requests to files from the Hex SDK website redirect to castarsdk\\.com. The SDKs are exactly the same.\n\nThe EarnSDK JAR package for Android has strong overlaps with the other SDK brands analyzed. Earlier published samples contained the Tier One C2 domains:\n\nOf note, these domains were observed as part of the BadBox2.0 botnet and were sinkholed in our earlier litigation. Pivoting off these domains and other signatures, we identified some additional domains used as Tier One C2 domains:\n\nOur analysis of various malware samples and the SDKs found a single shared pool of Tier Two servers. As of this writing there were approximately 7,400 Tier Two servers. The number of Tier Two nodes changes on a daily basis, consistent with a demand-based scaling system. They are hosted in locations around the globe, including the US. This indicates that despite different brand names and Tier One domains, the different SDKs in fact manage devices and proxy traffic through the same infrastructure.\n\nThe IPIDEA actors also control domains that offer free Virtual Private Network services. While the applications do seem to provide VPN functionality, they also join the device to the IPIDEA proxy network as an exit node by incorporating Hex or Packet SDK. This is done without clear disclosures to the end user, nor is it the primary function of the application.\n\nWe identified a total of 3,075 unique Windows PE file hashes where dynamic analysis recorded a DNS request to at least one Tier One domain. A number of these hashes were for the monetized proxy exit node software, PacketShare. Our analysis also uncovered applications masquerading as OneDriveSync and Windows Update. These trojanized Windows applications were not distributed directly by the IPIDEA actors.\n\nWe identified over 600 applications across multiple download sources with code connecting to Tier One C2 domains. These apps were largely benign in function (e.g., utilities, games, and content) but utilized monetization SDKs that enabled IPIDEA proxy behavior.\n\nThis week we took a number of steps designed to comprehensively dismantle as much of IPIDEA’s infrastructure as possible.\n\nWe took legal action to take down the C2 domains used by bad actors to control devices and proxy traffic. This protects consumer devices and home networks by disrupting the infrastructure at the source.\n\nTo safeguard the Android ecosystem, we enforced our platform policies against trojanizing software, ensuring Google Play Protect on certified Android devices with Google Play services automatically warns users and removes applications known to incorporate IPIDEA software development kits (SDKs), and blocks any future install attempts.\n\nWe took legal action to take down the domains used to market IPIDEA’s products, including proxy software and software development kits, across their various brands.\n\nWe’ve shared our findings with industry partners to enable them to take action as well. We’ve worked closely with other firms, including Spur and Lumen’s Black Lotus Labs to understand the scope and extent of residential proxy networks and the bad behavior they often enable. We partnered with Cloudflare to disrupt IPIDEA’s domain resolution, impacting their ability to command and control infected devices and market their products.\n\nWhile we believe our actions have seriously impacted one of the largest residential proxy providers, this industry appears to be rapidly expanding, and there are significant overlaps across providers. As our investigation shows, the residential proxy market has become a \"gray market\" that thrives on deception—hijacking consumer bandwidth to provide cover for global espionage and cybercrime. More must be done to address the risks of these technologies.\n\nResidential proxies are an understudied area of risk for consumers, and more can be done to raise awareness. Consumers should be extremely wary of applications that offer payment in exchange for \"unused bandwidth\" or \"sharing your internet.\" These applications are primary ways for illicit proxy networks to grow, and could open security vulnerabilities on the device’s home network. We urge users to stick to official app stores, review permissions for third-party VPNs and proxies, and ensure built-in security protections like Google Play Protect are active.\n\nConsumers should be careful when purchasing connected devices, such as set top boxes, to make sure they are from reputable manufacturers. For example, to help you confirm whether or not a device is built with the official Android TV OS and Play Protect certified, our Android TV website provides the most up-to-date list of partners. You can also take these steps to check if your Android device is Play Protect certified.\n\nResidential proxy providers have been able to flourish under the guise of legitimate businesses. While some providers may indeed behave ethically and only enroll devices with the clear consent of consumers, any claims of \"ethical sourcing\" must be backed by transparent, auditable proof of user consent. Similarly, app developers have a responsibility to vet the monetization SDKs they integrate.\n\nWe encourage mobile platforms, ISPs, and other tech platforms to continue sharing intelligence and implementing best practices to identify illicit proxy networks and limit their harms.\n\nTo assist the wider community in hunting and identifying activity outlined in this blog post, we have included a comprehensive list of indicators of compromise (IOCs) in a GTI Collection for registered users.\n\n00857cca77b615c369f48ead5f8eb7f3.com\n\n31d58c226fc5a0aa976e13ca9ecebcc8.com\n\n3k7m1n9p4q2r6s8t0v5w2x4y6z8u9.com\n\n7x2k9n4p1q0r5s8t3v6w0y2z4u7b9.com\n\n8b21a945159f23b740c836eb50953818.com\n\na8d3b9e1f5c7024d6e0b7a2c9f1d83e5.com\n\naf4760df2c08896a9638e26e7dd20aae.com\n\nb5e9a2d7f4c8e3b1a0d6f2e9c5b8a7d.com\n\ncfe47df26c8eaf0a7c136b50c703e173.com\n\ne4f8c1b9a2d7e3f6c0b5a8d9e2f1c4d.com\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=69878507/C=HK/L=Hong Kong Island/O=HONGKONG LINGYUN MDT INFOTECH LIMITED/CN=HONGKONG LINGYUN MDT INFOTECH LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/businessCategory=Private Organization/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/serialNumber=2746134/C=HK/L=Wan Chai/O=HONGKONG LINGYUN MDT INFOTECH LIMITED/CN=HONGKONG LINGYUN MDT INFOTECH LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=74092936/C=HK/L=HONG KONG ISLAND/O=FIRENET LIMITED/CN=FIRENET LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=3157599/C=HK/L=Wan Chai/O=FIRENET LIMITED/CN=FIRENET LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=74097562/C=HK/L=Hong Kong Island/O=PRINCE LEGEND LIMITED/CN=PRINCE LEGEND LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=73874246/C=HK/L=Kowloon/O=MARS BROTHERS LIMITED/CN=MARS BROTHERS LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=3135905/C=HK/L=Cheung Sha Wan/O=MARS BROTHERS LIMITED/CN=MARS BROTHERS LIMITED\n\nSIGNER_IDENTITY=/1.3.6.1.4.1.311.60.2.1.3=HK/businessCategory=Private Organization/serialNumber=3222394/C=HK/L=WAN CHAI/O=DATALABS LIMITED/CN=DATALABS LIMITED\n\nPacket SDK package found inside other applications\n\naef34f14456358db91840c416e55acc7d10185ff2beb362ea24697d7cdad321f\n\nApplication with Packet SDK Code\n\nb0726bdd53083968870d0b147b72dad422d6d04f27cd52a7891d038ee83aef5b\n\n2d1891b6d0c158ad7280f0f30f3c9d913960a793c6abcda249f9c76e13014e45\n\n59cbdecfc01eba859d12fbeb48f96fe3fe841ac1aafa6bd38eff92f0dcfd4554\n\nba9b1f4cc2c7f4aeda7a1280bbc901671f4ec3edaa17f1db676e17651e9bff5f\n\n01ac6012d4316b68bb3165ee451f2fcc494e4e37011a73b8cf2680de3364fcf4",

    "description": "Amid growing affordability concerns across the nation, President Trump said he is looking to drive housing prices further up, not down.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON − Amid growing affordability concerns across the nation, President Donald Trump said he is looking to drive housing prices further up, not down.\n\nTrump said at a Jan. 29 Cabinet meeting he wants to make it easier for Americans to buy homes ‒ but not by making housing less expensive. Instead, he suggested lower interest rates he expects from his upcoming pick to lead the Federal Reserve will allow more Americans to buy homes even as housing prices rise.\n\n\"I don't want to drive housing prices down. I want to drive housing prices up for people that own their homes,\" Trump said. \"And they can be assured that's what's going to happen.\"\n\nTrump has been rolling out several policy proposals and actions aimed at addressing affordability and housing as Americans continue to express cost-of-living concerns. That includes a Jan. 20 executive order banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes in a push to expand home ownership. The Trump administration is also purchasing mortgage-backed securities to lower mortgage rates.\n\nYet Trump made clear in his meeting with Cabinet secretaries that greater opportunities to buy homes shouldn't mean lowering costs, even as Americans voice concerns about the price tag to buy a home.\n\n\"Existing housing, people that own their homes, we're going to keep them wealthy,\" Trump said. \"We're going to keep those prices up. We're not going to destroy the value of their homes so that somebody who didn't work very hard can buy a home.\n\n\"We're going to make it easier to buy,\" the president added. \"We're going to get interest rates down. But I want to protect the people who, for the first time in their lives, feel good about themselves. They feel like, you know, that they're wealthy people.\"\n\nHousing prices rose in November 0.6% over the previous month, according to the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency's most recent monthly report, released Jan. 27. The median home price nationally soared to a record $433,000 in November 2025, according to the real estate company Redfin. Zillow projects housing prices to increase by 1.9% in 2026.\n\nHousing prices remain elevated relative to income growth after adjusting for inflation, pushing homeownership out of reach for many Americans. The housing market is considered stagnant amid a national housing shortage, especially at the lower end of the market.\n\nTrump last week said he opposes a plan endorsed by his White House economic team that would allow Americans to use retirement savings from their 401(k) accounts to make down payments on homes.\n\nTrump told his Cabinet he intends to announce his nominee as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve next week. For the past year, Trump has criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for refusing to aggressively lower interest rates as Trump has demanded. Powell's term as Fed chairman ends in May.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.",

    "title": "The Cost of PostgreSQL Arrays",
    "description": "Deep dive into PostgreSQL arrays: why they're document storage in disguise, the TOAST performance trap, GIN vs B-tree indexing, the dangerous ANY() operator, and when junction tables beat arrays.",
    "fullText": "Starting with arrays in PostgreSQL is as simple as declaring a column as integer[], inserting some values, and you are done.\n\nOr building the array on the fly.\n\nThe official documentation provides a good introduction. But beneath this straightforward interface lies a set of more complex properties than most of us realise. Arrays in PostgreSQL are not just \"lists\" in a field. They have their own memory management strategy, their own index logic, and a lot of edge-case scenarios.\n\nAs it goes with boringSQL deep-dives, this article will explore the corners of array functionality that might break your production.\n\nWait? Are we going to talk about JSONB arrays? Not at all. The whole concept of arrays in RDBMSs is actually document storage in disguise.\n\nIn database design, locality ensures faster retrieval times by keeping related data close on physical storage.Whether you use a distinct integer[] type or a JSON list [1, 2, 3], you are making the exact same architectural decision: you are prioritising locality over normalisation.\n\nWhen you store tag_ids in an array, you are embedding related data directly into a row - just like a NoSQL database might embed subdocuments. This is not inherently wrong. Document databases exist for good reasons: they eliminate joins, simplify reads, and map naturally to application objects.\n\nBut PostgreSQL is a relational database. It was designed around the relational model, where:\n\nArrays give you document-model convenience, but you lose relational promises. There are no foreign keys and no ON DELETE referential_action (like CASCADE) for array elements. If you delete a tags entry, the orphaned ID will remain in your array forever.\n\nThe rule of thumb is that if you find yourself in need of referential integrity - you most likely want a link table, not an array. Arrays are for data that shares the same lifecycle as the parent row. Not for relationships spanning across different tables.\n\nA practical example is the author of a blog post (one author might write multiple other posts), whereas a whitelist of IP addresses for a service account is only applicable to the given entity.\n\nWith JSONB being so flexible, you might wonder why we still bother with quirkier native types. The answer lies in the 'boring' part of the database: predictability and efficiency. An integer[] column guarantees that every element is an integer.\n\nArrays are also more storage-efficient for primitives because they don't carry the metadata overhead of JSON objects.\n\nThis post assumes basic knowledge of arrays. We won't cover the basics.\n\nthat is until you find an array with the arbitrary bounds. Which PostgreSQL allows.\n\nTo make sure you iterate correctly through any given array, always use array_lower() and array_upper() in PL/pgSQL\n\nor generate_subscripts() in SQL.\n\nWhen creating a table, you might expect strict typing. That's true for everything — except the array dimensions. You might think integer[][] enforces a 2D matrix. Except it does not. The [] syntax is effectively syntactic sugar. PostgreSQL does not enforce the number of dimensions of sub-arrays at the schema level at all by default.\n\nIf you want to enforce a specific array dimension, you cannot rely on the type definition. Instead, you must use a CHECK constraint.\n\nThe only exception is that PostgreSQL enforces uniformity of arrays on every nesting level. This means it rejects sub-arrays with different sizes.\n\nWhen accessing array values, it's important to consider that the syntax [1] and [1:1] are different. While the first one is an accessor, the second one acts like a constructor.\n\nWhen slicing an array, even if the slice is a single-element, it will be returned as a single-element array, not a scalar value.\n\nAccessing array values has a forgiving behaviour, making it more difficult to find underlying bugs:\n\nBut the single most confusing aspect that might trip you up coming from other programming languages is the fact that PostgreSQL treats multi-dimensional arrays as a single matrix, not an array of arrays.\n\nWhile in other languages you expect {1,2} as a result, PostgreSQL can't give it to you. It tries to return the first cell and fails (because the index is not complete).\n\nAnd to paraphrase Fletcher's \"Double Bubble\" analogy (which also went very wrong — extra points for getting the reference), you can't fix this by using slice notation.\n\nThe only way to solve this puzzle is to unnest the slice and re-aggregate the results.\n\nThe other alternative is to cast it to JSONB and back. Not pretty no matter how you look at it. If you need to work with complex multi-dimensional structures where each sub-array has independent meaning, just use JSONB. It will do exactly what you expect.\n\nWhile you can use a B-tree index on an array column, it won't help you unless you are looking for whole-array equality and sorting an array by dictionary rules.\n\nRendering B-tree indexes useless for any real-world index operations.\n\nWhen working with arrays, you actually need GIN (Generalized Inverted Index). If a B-tree index is a phone book, GIN is an index at the back of the book. To query one or more elements, you need to find all possible locations and then intersect them to find the locations that match.\n\nGIN indexes are designed for set operations, making presence the key feature, while ignoring order. Here are operators that GIN provides for arrays:\n\nContainment @> - matches rows that include ALL of the selected items.\n\nOverlap && - does the row include ANY of the selected items.\n\nThere's also <@ and = (equality), but they should be easy to understand.\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. While you might often hear (myself included) that you shouldn't use dynamic SQL for IN lists and should use ANY instead, there are some dangers you need to be aware of.\n\nThe ANY operator behaves very differently depending on which side of the comparison the array sits.\n\nThe advice to use ANY holds true when you are passing lists into the database. Instead of generating a query with 100 distinct parameters (WHERE id IN ($1, $2, ... $100)), which bloats your query cache and forces hard-parses, you should pass a single array parameter.\n\nThe trap is assuming this syntax is equally efficient when querying array columns. It is not. If you use ANY to check if a value exists inside a table column, you are effectively asking the database to loop.\n\nWhen you write WHERE 'feature' = ANY(tags), you are not actually using an array operator. What you wrote is a scalar integer equality operator = applied inside a loop construct. Since the scalar operator = is not part of array_ops, the planner assumes the index cannot help and falls back to a sequential scan.\n\nThe correct way to rewrite the query is:\n\nBecause a GIN index is built to work with sets, it is expensive to maintain. With a B-tree index, one row equals one index entry. In a GIN index, one row equals N index entries, where N is the number of elements in your array.\n\nThis leads to write multiplication. To prevent this, PostgreSQL defaults to using a \"fast update\" mechanism. This is a strategy where new entries are added to a pending list (an unsorted temporary buffer) and only merged into the main index structure later (during VACUUM).\n\nGiven the unsorted nature of a GIN index, it is an exception to VACUUM is a Lie, as VACUUM actually does perform structural maintenance here.While this makes INSERT operations manageable, it can slow down SELECTs. Every time you query the index, PostgreSQL must scan the organised main index plus the entire messy pending list. If that list grows large, your query performance might degrade.\n\nIf you operate a read-heavy workflow with infrequent writes, you should disable this to guarantee consistent reading performance.\n\nNow it's time to return to the document model. In PostgreSQL, rows are immutable (MVCC); there is no such thing as an \"in-place update\", and arrays are stored as atomic values. This results in a very uncomfortable truth — to modify a single element of an array, PostgreSQL must copy and rewrite the entire row.\n\nEvery single append rewrites the entire array, which in effect results in a rewrite of the entire row.\n\nWhen any array grows large enough (> 2 KB — see below), PostgreSQL moves it automatically to a separate storage area using TOAST. While this keeps the data row lean, it turns array updates into a severe performance bottleneck.\n\nThe difference this introduces is subtle but comes with a big impact. While a standard MVCC update simply copies the row version on the main heap, updating a TOASTed array forces PostgreSQL to fetch all external chunks, decompress the entire object into memory, apply the change, and then recompress and write the new full-size blob back to the TOAST table. This turns a simple modification into a CPU and I/O-intensive operation that rewrites the entire dataset rather than just the delta.\n\nThe threshold is derived from TOAST_TUPLES_PER_PAGE (default: 4), ensuring 4 tuples fit on a page.Threshold: ~2 KBWhere does the 2 KB value come from? The TOAST threshold is calculated to ensure at least four tuples can fit on a single 8 KB heap page. PostgreSQL uses this to balance efficiency against the overhead of TOAST indirection.\n\nBefore version 14, PostgreSQL relied on pglz — an algorithm prioritising compression ratio over speed. This made the \"decompress-modify-compress\" cycle of TOAST painful.\n\nPostgreSQL 14 introduced LZ4 as an alternative:\n\nLZ4 is significantly faster for both compression and decompression, with only slightly lower compression ratios. If you are working with large arrays, switching to LZ4 is one of the easiest ways to reduce the CPU penalty of TOAST.\n\nYou might have gained the impression that arrays are bad. When evaluating the use of arrays, the real question isn't how big the array is but rather how often do you modify it? An array of 10,000 elements that you write once and is read-only for the rest of its lifecycle is a completely valid use case. An array of 50 elements that you append to on every incoming request is the real villain here.\n\nIf you combine this with compression, you might get an interesting mix.\n\nUp until now, it might seem that arrays don't actually bring many benefits. While they can have rough edges around storage, they are incredibly useful for transport.\n\nThe fastest way to insert 5,000 rows isn't a loop in your application, and it's definitely not a massive VALUES (...), (...) string. It's unnest.\n\nAll that is needed is one network round trip, and one query to parse and plan. PostgreSQL handles the arrays row by row internally for you. This works both for UPSERTs and MERGE.\n\nStandard PostgreSQL arrays are polymorphic types (anyarray). This provides a powerful feature that allows a single function definition to operate on many different data types. They have to handle integers, strings, timestamps, and custom types equally well. But if you have specific data types, you can unlock significant performance gains by using specialised extensions.\n\nIf you are dealing exclusively with 4-byte integers (int4/integer), the built-in array operations are leaving performance on the table. The intarray extension provides specialised functions and index operators that are significantly faster than the generic implementation.\n\nTo use it, you must explicitly enable it:\n\nThe difference in developer ergonomics is immediate. To sort an array in standard SQL, you are forced to unnest, order, and re-aggregate. With intarray, you get native functions like sort() and uniq().\n\nBeyond raw management functions, it introduces a specialised query syntax that simplifies complex boolean logic. Instead of chaining multiple overlap (&&) and containment (@>) checks, you can express your requirements in a single \"query string\" using the @@ operator.\n\nThe only catch is the type restriction. intarray is strictly limited to signed 32-bit integers. If your values exceed 2 billion, you are back where you started.\n\nYou cannot talk about arrays in 2026 without mentioning pgvector. While it markets itself as a \"vector store\", internally it is simply an array of floats with a different mathematical focus.\n\nStandard arrays are binary: they care about Exact Matches (Overlap &&, Containment @>). Vectors are all about fuzzy distance (Cosine <=>, Euclidean <->).\n\nIf you are building search or recommendation features, pgvector allows you to treat your array column not as a list of \"facts\" (tag A, tag B), but as coordinates in semantic space.\n\nNevertheless, the architectural decision is exactly the same as using a standard array: you are trading strict structure for convenience. Since there is no way to \"join\" two rows based on how similar they are, you store the vector directly on the row. You accept a larger table size in exchange for the ability to ask, \"What is close to this?\".\n\nPS: Thanks to Matthias Feist for inspiring this article.",

    "title": "Zuckerberg says AI is letting one employee do the work of entire teams, and it shows how the company is rethinking hiring",
    "description": "The tech giant is doubling down on a trend of companies operating with leaner workforces, though it's still on the hunt for rockstar talent.",
    "fullText": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says AI is transforming what a single employee can accomplish at the company, signaling it's adopting a new hiring strategy.\n\nOn an earnings call with analysts Thursday, Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said the company is investing in more AI-native tools to elevate individual contributors and flatten teams. The effort is being somewhat constrained, however, by a lack of compute resources.\n\n\"We're starting to see projects that used to require big teams now be accomplished by a single very talented person,\" he said. \"I want to make sure that as many of these very talented people as possible choose Meta as the place that they can make the greatest impact.\"\n\nThe Facebook and Instagram parent, which reported fourth-quarter revenue and earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, said it plans to boost AI spending by between 60% and 87% this year. Meta also said it already saw a significant increase in output per engineer last year, with the majority of that growth coming from the adoption of agentic coding.\n\nThough teams are on track to become smaller, finance chief Susan Li said on the earnings call that the company is still hungry for top talent. \"It remains a very competitive hiring market, but we'd like to invest aggressively where we can,\" she said.\n\nLi also noted that Meta closed out the December-ended quarter with 6% more employees than it had a year earlier, driven by hiring in areas such as monetization, infrastructure, Meta Superintelligence Labs, regulation, and compliance.\n\nMeta isn't alone in focusing on tiny teams. The strategy has become popular in the startup world, where founders have long prioritized scrappiness. It's a trend that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted would take hold back in February 2024.\n\n\"We're going to see 10-person companies with billion-dollar valuations pretty soon,\" he said at the time. \"In my little group chat with my tech CEO friends, there's this betting pool for the first year there is a one-person billion-dollar company, which would've been unimaginable without AI. And now [it] will happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, large companies have been thinning their middle manager ranks in recent years to boost efficiency by reducing bureaucracy, including Amazon and Intel. Meta's Zuckerberg wrote a memo in 2023 entitled \"Flatter is faster,\" and in late 2024, Google CEO Sundar Pichai told staff that the company cut vice president and manager roles by 10% as part of an efficiency push.\n\nThe trend isn't limited to tech companies. Retailers such as Walmart and Wayfair, and fintech firms like Block, have been moving managers into non-management roles. Some companies have also been conducting multiple rounds of mass layoffs. On Wednesday, Amazon said it would cut 16,000 corporate roles, the company's second round of layoffs in four months.\n\nOn Meta's earnings call, the company acknowledged that its goal of being able to lean on a smaller number of highly AI-savvy employees is challenged by a shortage of compute resources, as demand across the company has increased faster than its supply. Still, Zuckerberg expressed confidence in his outlook for greater efficiencies.\n\n\"I think that 2026 is going to be the year that AI starts to dramatically change the way that we work,\" he said. \"As we navigate this, our North Star is building the best place for individuals to make a massive impact.\"",

    "description": "Shares dropped the most since March 2020 on Thursday, with investors fleeing the stock amid slower cloud growth and big spending on AI.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft stock is getting crushed on Thursday.\n\nThe negative post-earnings reaction stems from investors' dismay over weaker-than-expected guidance in a key business area, alongside larger-than-expected spending on AI.\n\nMicrosoft earnings came in above both top and bottom line forecasts, with cloud revenue reaching $50 billion for the first time, but Microsoft stock still plunged 12%, its biggest decline since March 2020.\n\nWall Street analysts were laser-focused on AI spending heading into earnings, and the market's reaction to Microsoft and Meta's results shows that investors need to see strength elsewhere in the business to feel good about surging capex. Meta shares spiked on Thursday, and although its spending outlook jumped, that was offset by robust advertising business.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud platform revenue grew 39% on an annual basis, coming in above the forecast 38.4% but still below the 40% it posted in the previous quarter. According to finance pros, this is the primary factor driving Microsoft stock down.\n\n\"Microsoft allocated scarce GPU capacity away from Azure to 1P products, but the fact that BOTH Azure and the M365 segments fell a bit short is the key negative we're hearing that is driving the modest after-market fade,\" stated UBS analyst Karl Keirstead.\n\nOther Wall Street analysts think Microsoft could face challenges in the coming months if it can't find a way to boost its cloud revenue and win back Wall Street's confidence.\n\n\"I think sentiment around Microsoft is kind of negative right now. And if they don't really beat or re-accelerate Azure growth, the shares are probably not going to perform very well,\" Ryuta Makino of Gabelli Funds said.\n\nTech guru and University of Michigan professor Erik Gordon pointed to Microsoft's excessive spending as a catalyst for the stock's decline, noting that he sees it as a clear indication of a bubble in AI.\n\nTo get back to where it needs to be, though, Microsoft may need to spend even more. Blake Crawford, CIO of tech consulting firm Fusion Collective, raised the concern that much of its growth prospects hinge on the success of OpenAI.\n\n\"The number that sticks out like a sore thumb: remaining commercial obligations are up 110% to $625 billion, and OpenAI is a whopping 45% of that,\" he stated. \"That's a lot of hope-and-a-prayer that OpenAI will be able to deliver. And recognizing any potential upside will require significant capex.\"",

    "description": "In the final moments of Tesla's earnings call, Elon Musk urged companies to stop ignoring geopolitical risks by relying on foreign battery production.",
    "fullText": "\"Can other people, please, for the love of God, in the name of all that is holy, can others please build this stuff?\"\n\nElon Musk made the plea in the final moments of Tesla's earnings call on Wednesday, sounding a bit fired up.\n\nMusk had just finished giving a blunt warning to American companies: build more battery-making infrastructure in the US or risk falling behind.\n\nThe Tesla CEO argued that too many companies are underestimating their exposure to geopolitical risks posed by fragile supply chains, particularly for critical materials used in electric vehicles and energy storage.\n\n\"There are so many companies out there that are asleep at the switch with regard to geopolitical risk — or they just have their head in the sand and hope nothing bad will happen,\" Musk said. \"I'm way more paranoid than that.\"\n\nHe added that his concern has pushed Tesla to take unusual — and expensive — steps to protect its future, including building its own lithium-refining and battery-production facilities in Texas.\n\nIn December 2024, the company began processing lithium from its $1 billion Robstown, Texas, refinery. This month, Tesla announced it is producing dry-electrode 4680 cells with both anode and cathode made in Austin, which will end up in \"certain Model Ys.\"\n\nOn the call, Musk described those facilities as \"more advanced than anything else in the world,\" but stressed that Tesla does not want to be the only company making such investments.\n\n\"Why do we have to build these things? Why can others not also please build these things? I mean, it's very hard to build these things, and we're building them out of desperation, because nobody else is building lithium refineries and cathode refineries,\" Musk said.\n\n\"You know, we're pretty much the largest, but also the only lithium refinery and cathode refinery in America,\" he added. \"So, yeah. So. We're making moves to make sure that, no matter what happens, Tesla will prosper.\"\n\nIndependent research suggests Musk's worries are not unfounded.\n\nAn October analysis by the Dallas Federal Reserve identified 66 lithium projects across the US, but found that many remain in early development stages and face long timelines, high costs, and volatile lithium prices. Many projects could take a decade or more to reach commercial production, if they get there at all, the study found.\n\nA few other American automakers are beginning to invest as well.\n\nIn 2024, General Motors invested $625 million in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas Corporation's plans to build a lithium mine in Nevada. The facility is expected to become America's largest mine and plans to open between late 2026 and early 2027. In 2025, the US government took a minority stake in the project.\n\nTesla argues that its investments in battery infrastructure and energy storage have helped offset auto revenue pressure as its car business declines.\n\nTesla's lithium-based energy storage batteries — called Megapacks — reported Q4 revenue of over $3.8 billion, a 25% increase from the year-ago period.\n\nAnalysts express some concern that Tesla is committing tens of billions of dollars to long-term industrial projects, even as the company is openly uncertain about near-term returns.\n\n\"What we learned from the earnings call is that a whole bunch of billions of dollars will be flowing out of the company in the form of capital expenditures: more than $20 billion,\" David Meier, a senior analyst at Motley Fool, told Business Insider. \"That's a massive investment, but it's necessary as the plan is to raise 6 production plants, continue to develop AI infrastructure, and upgrade current manufacturing facilities.\"\n\nMusk warned that companies that fail to insulate against geopolitical risks could pay a steep price.\n\n\"Companies that don't do that,\" he said, \"a bunch of them will cease to exist.\"",

    "title": "I was laid off by Amazon and landed a new role 2 weeks later. Here's my advice for other laid-off tech workers.",
    "description": "After being laid off by Amazon in October 2025, Iren Azra Zou landed a new job two weeks later. She shared her top advice for other laid-off workers.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Iren Azra Zou, a 27-year-old in New Jersey. She is a founding engineer at tech startup Double Nickel, and previously worked as a software engineer at Amazon until being laid off in October 2025. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThe day before Amazon announced layoffs in October, there were rumors that something big was coming.\n\nI had a strange feeling in my gut that I might be affected, even though I felt I was performing well and had met my goals earlier than expected. I'd been laid off from my previous tech job the year prior, in 2024, and I knew how, in situations like these, people can quickly become just numbers on a spreadsheet.\n\nIt was hard to sleep that night, and the next morning, I woke up to a 6 a.m. automated text from Amazon telling me to check my email for a message about my role. At that moment, I was pretty sure I had been laid off, which the message soon confirmed.\n\nThe first person I told was my husband, who was next to me in bed. After that, I messaged a few close coworkers to figure out who else had been affected. When I found out that some rock stars on my team had also been laid off, I was shocked.\n\nI was mentally prepared for my layoff — due to the speculation that cuts were coming — but I was also financially prepared.\n\nMy husband and I had taken steps to save aggressively and ensure we had enough savings to last for a while if we were both laid off. That financial cushion helped me stay calm when I found out I'd lost my job.\n\nI made a point to stick to my daily routines: coffee, exercise, and sleep schedule. I didn't want everything to feel chaotic.\n\nI quickly started looking for new job opportunities, and two weeks later, I landed and accepted an offer to start a software engineering role in December.\n\nHere's my advice for anyone who's recently been laid off:\n\nWhen you get laid off, you can't help but ask yourself, \"Why me?\"\n\nEventually, you come to terms with the reality that you can do everything right and still be included in a layoff simply because you're a number on a budget sheet. I know I worked hard and brought a lot to the table; a layoff didn't erase that.\n\nI was prepared for interviewers to ask about my Amazon layoff, but it didn't really come up. I think other companies recognized the scale of the layoff and that it wasn't performance-based, in many cases. I also think that, despite the layoff, having a household name like Amazon on my résumé was probably helpful.\n\nReflect on what you want in your next role and create a targeted job search plan to maximize your chances of landing it. I wanted to make sure I found the right fit, so this was really helpful for me.\n\nUpon reflection, I decided that the best fit for me might be at a smaller company with less bureaucracy than Amazon — and where I could better see the impact of my work.\n\nThe pro of working at a big company was that you could do one thing and it could affect millions of people in less than 30 minutes, which was exciting. However, the downside was that it sometimes felt like you were a very tiny piece in a giant machine.\n\nI was also hoping to land a remote role. For the last few months of my time at Amazon, I'd been required to commute one hour each way from New Jersey to the New York City office five days a week, which was really draining. I figured I might have more leverage to ask for remote flexibility at a smaller company than at Amazon, where so many people are competing for job postings.\n\nMy team at Amazon also didn't have many women, so I wanted to be in a place with a bit more diversity.\n\nI narrowed down my target: a software engineering role at a small company that offered remote flexibility — and where I felt I could grow and thrive.\n\nThis is not the time to be shy — most people will be sympathetic and eager to support you.\n\nI believe my LinkedIn presence — where I'm very active, posting career advice tailored to young professionals — helped me boost my visibility.\n\nThe day after my layoff, the chief technology officer of Double Nickel — a tech startup focused on truck driver recruitment — reached out to me on LinkedIn about a software engineering role they were hiring for. She said she'd seen my post-layoff LinkedIn post and, as a former Amazon employee herself, decided to reach out.\n\nThe role seemed like a good fit, so I applied and quickly landed an interview.\n\nFollowing the interviews, I was given an offer, which I accepted. We agreed to an arrangement where I'd work in a hybrid setup for the first few months to help with onboarding, and then transition to remote work around the end of February. So far, I'm very happy with the role.\n\nLooking back, I see the layoff as a turning point because it helped me clarify what I wanted in my next role. It was still a difficult experience, but I felt more grounded and optimistic as time went on — and ultimately landed a role I feel great about.",

    "description": "Blackstone sees major returns from its data center bet, and plans to continue to \"lean into\" the AI boom.",
    "fullText": "Data center investments have become the engine of Blackstone's growth.\n\nThe Wall Street investment giant reported that QTS, the data center developer and operator it took private in 2021, was the single largest driver of gains in the company's $1.3 trillion portfolio in 2025. The results were a clear sign that Blackstone's bets on digital infrastructure amid the artificial intelligence boom have reaped returns as other segments of its business, including real estate and private credit, have run into headwinds.\n\nIn a call on Wednesday to discuss Blackstone's year-end performance, Stephen Schwarzman, the firm's co-founder and chairman, called QTS now \"the world's largest data center platform.\"\n\nJon Gray, the company's president, said that investor interest in AI was a chief driver of strong inflows. The company reported $239 billion of inflows for the year, its highest total since a record year in 2021.\n\n\"You have what's happening in the AI world, economy growing faster, productivity picking up, and us investing in sectors we really like,\" Gray said. \"We think that will really get this flywheel going, which is why you hear this optimism.\"\n\nGray said its bets on AI and data centers had delivered for the company. Its infrastructure platform — powered by data center appreciation — had grown 40% during the year to $77 billion and had raised $4 billion from investors in the fourth quarter. Infrastructure investments earned 8.4% returns for the quarter and 23.5% for the year.\n\nBlackstone Real Estate Income Trust, the firm's $54 billion retail focused real estate investment fund, meanwhile, generated 8.1% returns during the year, more than double its benchmark for the sector. The fund, which is known as BREIT, is heavily invested in QTS.\n\nReal estate investments, broadly, were the weakest segment for Blackstone, delivering a 0.6% loss for its opportunistic strategy and 3% gains for its core assets.\n\nQTS, which Blackstone originally bought for $10 billion, was the \"largest single driver of returns\" for its infrastructure strategy, Blackstone Infrastructure Partners, as well as in real estate,\" Gray said.\n\nSchwarzman said the firm would continue to \"lean into key thematic areas such as digital infrastructure, including data centers, power, and electrification, private credit,\" as part of its broader investment strategy.\n\n\"The historic pace of investment taking place in the US to facilitate the development of artificial intelligence, including the design and manufacture of semiconductors, data center construction, and the expansion of power generation, is the key driver of economic growth today,\" Schwarzman said.\n\nGray added that the firm's $319 billion real estate platform would \"continue to invest in AI infrastructure and data centers.\"\n\nIn private lending, Gray said the artificial intelligence race and the hundreds of billions of dollars in related spending it will require would also feed the company's private credit business.\n\n\"The build-out of AI infrastructure requires a massive amount of private debt capital for the construction of fabs, energy supply, and data centers,\" Gray said. Fabs refer to computer chip manufacturing facilities.\n\nGray reported that Blackstone's investment grade private credit portfolio now totaled $130 billion, an increase of 30% during the year, while also acknowledging that BCRED, one of its largest credit fund had an \"uptick in redemptions\" tied to industry-wide concerns about default risks.\n\nBlackstone has long touted its focus on data centers.\n\nIn addition to QTS, the firm has invested in the AI developers Anthropic and OpenAI, the storage and high performance computing provider DDN, as well as energy providers who will deliver the prodigious electricity needed for AI computing. Last year, the firm, for instance, announced its $11.5 billion acquisition of TXNM Energy, a utility holding company. In 2024, the company was part of a group of investors that provided the data center operator CoreWeave with a $7.5 billion loan.\n\nBlackstone reported $14.5 billion of revenue for the year and $4.4 billion for the quarter, up 9% and 42% respectively.",

    "fullText": "A man was arrested for pretending to be an FBI agent in an effort to break an inmate out of the Brooklyn prison housing Luigi Mangione, who's awaiting trial over the shooting of UnitedHealthcare's CEO, prosecutors said on Thursday.\n\nMark Anderson showed up at the Metropolitan Detention Center jail claiming to have a court order to let an inmate walk free, federal prosecutors said in a criminal complaint released on Thursday.\n\nAfter Bureau of Prisons officials asked Anderson to identify himself, he produced a Minnesota driver's license and said he had weapons in his backpack, according to the complaint. He also \"displayed and threw at the BOP officers numerous documents,\" the complaint said.\n\nBureau of Prisons officials found a pizza cutter and barbecue fork in the bag, the complaint said.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Brooklyn have accused Anderson of impersonating an FBI agent. He was expected to appear before a magistrate judge in a federal court on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe criminal complaint does not name Mangione. A law enforcement source told Business Insider that Mangione was the inmate Anderson wanted to free from jail.\n\nAccording to the law enforcement source, Anderson had been working at a pizzeria in the New York City area.\n\nAn attorney for Anderson couldn't immediately be identified. An attorney for Mangione didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMangione has been jailed in the Metropolitan Detention Center while awaiting trial for the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December 2024.\n\nHe is still in jail as of Thursday afternoon despite Anderson's alleged efforts, according to Bureau of Prison records.\n\nMangione is due in federal court in Manhattan on Friday morning, when a judge may rule on pending issues, including whether he will face the death penalty at his murder trial. US District Court Judge Margaret Garnett may also rule on whether prosecutors can show jurors key evidence from Mangione's December 9 arrest — including a 9mm handgun and a journal police say they recovered from his backpack.\n\nGarnett scheduled jury selection for the federal charges against Mangione for September.

    "title": "How to watch NBC: Live stream the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics, and more",
    "description": "NBC is the broadcast home of Super Bowl LX, the Winter Olympics, and much more in 2026. We'll show you how to watch NBC without cable.",
    "fullText": "NBC has long been a popular channel to have in your TV line-up, but the network's upcoming broadcasts of the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl LX make it all but necessary. Fortunately, there are a few easy ways to live stream the network, even if you don't have cable or an antenna. Keep reading to learn how to watch NBC online.\n\nNBC is the home of beloved sitcoms such as \"The Office\" and \"30 Rock\" and flagship procedurals like the \"Law & Order\" and \"Chicago\" universes. In addition to a massive selection of currently airing scripted programming (in addition to series like \"Saturday Night Live\"), the network has become a key player in the news and sports scene. The \"Today\" show and NBC News have long been among the network's main draws, but NBC has increasingly invested in sports over the years, becoming a must-have destination for fans of the NFL, NBA, and the Olympics. NBC is also the broadcast home of flagship events, like the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Super Bowl LX, and the 2026 Emmy Awards.\n\nWhether you're hoping to stream NBC live or get caught up with past network programming on-demand, we've got you covered. Below, we've outlined everything you need to know about tuning in to the network without cable, including a breakdown of NBCUniversal's direct streaming service, Peacock.\n\n*NBC is only available in select regions on Sling.\n\nNBC's direct streaming counterpart is Peacock, a one-stop shop for all things NBCUniversal. There are three tiers of service, ranging from Peacock Select ($8 a month) to Peacock Premium Plus ($17 a month). Select is fairly pared-down and doesn't offer live events, so we recommend Premium or Premium Plus to unlock the full suite of on-demand offerings from the streaming service.\n\nPeacock has a massive collection of-demand seasons of NBC and Bravo shows, among other programming. New episodes typically land on the streaming service the day after their linear broadcast, so if you don't mind waiting a day (and watching with ads), the $11 a month Premium option should do the trick. However, if you'd like to stream NBC live and watch on-demand programming without ads, you'll need Peacock Premium for $17 a month. Both Premium and Premium Plus will carry the Super Bowl and the Olympics.\n\nPeacock Premium Plus subscription is $17 a month. The extra cost gets rid of most ads, allows you to download select titles, and also comes with your local NBC channel.\n\nDirecTV is another solid way to live stream NBC, along with other popular channels. In our guide to the best live TV streaming services, DirecTV ranks as the best cable alternative. NBC is available in several packages, including all signature plans and a couple of cheaper genre packs. Signature plans start at $90 a month for the Entertainment plan, which carries NBC and 90+ other channels (including pretty much anything you'd find in a standard cable plan).\n\nNBC is also available in MyNews and MySports genre packs. MyNews costs $40 a month and comes with 10+ popular news channels, while MySports costs $70 a month and offers around 20 sports networks and access to ESPN Unlimited. All DirecTV plans come with a five-day free trial for new customers.\n\nPreviously known as AT&T TV, DirecTV offers streaming access to a large selection of live channels, including most key networks typically found in traditional cable packages.\n\nIf you're looking for more of a budget-friendly pick, Sling TV will also allow you to live stream NBC and a handful of other channels. It's a great budget live TV service, but it's important to note that local channel coverage (like NBC) varies from region to region, so you should see what's available in your ZIP code before signing up. NBC-friendly plans (where available) include Sling Select and Sling Blue.\n\nSling Select offers around 10 channels and costs $25 a month when local networks are involved. Sling Blue carries 40+ channels and costs $50 a month for those with local channel access. If you're looking for a more comprehensive cable alternative, you can get Sling Orange + Blue for $65 a month.\n\nFor just the essentials without any extra fluff, Sling TV is the streaming service you're looking for. It's more customizable than other plans, with three options you can choose from, so you pay for only what you need. New members often get a chunky discount on their first month.",

    "description": "Trump's admin posted its proposed rule to overhaul student-loan repayment, including new caps on borrowing. The public will have 30 days to comment.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's sweeping student-loan changes are a key step closer to becoming reality.\n\nThe Department of Education announced on Thursday that it has published the proposed rule on student-loan repayment changes in the Federal Register, a key step the department must complete before implementing the final rule.\n\nAfter Trump signed his \"big beautiful\" spending legislation into law, the department began negotiations with stakeholders on the proposed changes, which included new borrowing caps, the elimination of existing income-driven repayment plans, and a new repayment plan with less generous terms than those of existing plans.\n\nPublishing the rule to the Federal Register is the next step in the negotiated rulemaking process, allowing the department to progress toward implementing the rule in July.\n\n\"With consensus reached in support of the Department's proposed rule, we have a clear path forward to fulfill the President's promise of making higher education more affordable and ensuring that every professional in America—from teachers and nurses to physicians and clergy—can pursue their careers without taking on debt they may never be able to repay,\" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement.\n\nOnce the rule is formally published on Friday, the public will have until March 2 to comment on the proposed rule. The department said in its press release that it would consider the comments and \"may make changes to the proposed regulations in response to substantive comments.\"\n\nOne key change in the rule is the creation of a new Repayment Assistance Plan. It would set borrowers' payments at 1% to 10% of their income, and any remaining balance would be forgiven after 30 years. It's less generous than the SAVE plan, which the legislation eliminates. SAVE, created by former President Joe Biden, allowed for lower monthly payments and forgiveness after 10 years.\n\nWhile the spending legislation would not eliminate SAVE before 2028, the department announced a proposed settlement which, if approved, would accelerate that timeline and require borrowers to switch to a new plan within a limited timeframe.\n\nIn addition to the new repayment plans, the proposed rule would place new borrowing caps on graduate and professional degrees while eliminating the Grad PLUS program, which allowed graduate students to borrow up to the full cost of attendance for their programs.\n\nChanges for defaulted student-loan borrowers are also coming; the rule would allow borrowers in default to rehabilitate their loans twice, a process that would require them to work with their servicer on a payment plan that would eventually result in the default status being removed from their credit reports. Borrowers were previously allowed just one chance to rehabilitate.",

    "title": "I'm trying to guess why Elon Musk wants to mash SpaceX into xAI — or Tesla. I'm stumped.",
    "description": "Elon Musk's companies already share employees, resources and investors. Maybe a possible merger of SpaceX and xAI  — or Tesla — would simplify things.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk starts and owns lots of companies. Maybe he's going to change that, a bit: The world's richest man is reportedly working on a plan to merge two of his most valuable companies into one megacompany.\n\nWhich one of his companies is a question: Reuters reports that Musk wants to merge xAI — his very valuable AI company that has already merged with the company that used to be called Twitter — into SpaceX, his very valuable rocket company. And Bloomberg reports that SpaceX is also considering a merger with Tesla, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe SpaceX-xAI tie-up could help Musk build data centers in space. \"The combination would bring Musk's rockets, Starlink satellites, the X social media platform and ​Grok AI chatbot under one roof,\" the Reuters report says. Then again, Reuters also says it doesn't know several key details about the theoretical deal, including \"its ‌primary rationale.\"\n\nAnd to be honest, the rationale seems a little obscure to me, too.\n\nThe main reason I can think of to merge one private company with another private company that's about to go public would be to make it easier for the smaller private company to finance itself.\n\nIn this case, that would mean that xAI wouldn't have to rely on the private markets as it races after the likes of OpenAI, Google, and Meta in the competition for AI talent and chips. It could tap the public market instead.\n\nThe problem with that theory: People in the private market are lining up to throw money at xAI, which just raised $20 billion. The company boasted that it was only going to raise $15 billion, but people kept throwing money at it, so it had to go and raise more.\n\nAnd, Muskian boasting aside, that makes lots of sense: Despite all the AI bubble chat, people are eager to put money into big, privately owned AI companies, as OpenAI and Anthropic prove every time they raise a ton of money, which happens to be all the time.\n\nJust as important: People are eager to give Elon Musk money because he's made a lot of people a lot of money from Tesla, and they're eager to give him another chance. (That's why the people who helped him fund his value-destroying Twitter deal never once complained about it in public: They wanted a chance to invest in his next deal.)\n\nI've asked Musk, SpaceX, and xAI for comment. It may be worth noting that Musk, who complains about coverage of his companies all the time, did not complain when someone retweeted the Reuters story Thursday afternoon.\n\nI suppose you could also try to argue that SpaceX and xAI make sense together because a bunch of their work overlaps, like the theoretical xAI space data centers that could get built with SpaceX rockets.\n\nBut Elon Musk has always treated his various companies as one big company when it suits him. He moves engineering and managing talent from one company to another when he wants — even when those employees work for Tesla, which is publicly owned, and theoretically should have a problem with lending its staff to other people's companies.\n\nSometimes there are complaints about Musk using resources from one company to help another — or, perhaps, himself. But Musk has pretty much ignored all of those complaints. I can't believe he's interested in moving xAI into SpaceX because he cares about corporate governance.\n\nAnother reason to mash the companies together might be to reward investors who bet on one private company by giving them publicly traded shares in the combined company. But, again, that doesn't really track here: Musk has a bunch of loyal backers, like Fidelity and Valor Equity Partners, which try to get into all his deals, and are already in both companies.\n\nSo maybe there will be a big galaxy-brained rationale for mushing xAI or Tesla and SpaceX together, and we just have to wait for Musk to unveil it. In the absence of that, here's my last guess: Musk, who is already reportedly trying to time his SpaceX IPO to \"coincide with a rare planetary alignment and his birthday,\" per Financial Times reports, just wants his giant SpaceX IPO to be even bigger. Prior to Thursday's report, SpaceX was supposed to go public at a $1.5 trillion valuation — the largest IPO in history. So maybe he's just trying to boost that valuation by a half trillion more.",

    "title": "Darren Aronofsky's New AI Series About the Revolutionary War Looks Like Dogshit",
    "description": "\"Used to be that when Darren Aronofsky wanted to feature a dead-eyed actor, he'd just employ Jared Leto.\"",
    "fullText": "Darren Aronofsky used to be a director who made interesting, if sometimes polarizing, films like Black Swan, Mother!, Noah, and The Wrestler. But it seems like a safe bet that people won’t need to debate whether Aronofsky’s new project is any good. Because anyone with eyes can see that it looks like low-effort AI slop. To put it another way, it looks like absolute dogshit.\n\nAronofsky is producing a new short-form series with his AI production company Primordial Soup titled “On This Day… 1776,” according to the Hollywood Reporter. The series uses tech from Google DeepMind to create short videos about the Revolutionary War, published on the YouTube channel for Time magazine. In 2018, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff bought Time, and the cloud software giant is sponsoring this monstrosity of a series.\n\nThe series uses human voice actors who belong to the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), which is clearly an attempt to tamp down on the inevitable backlash from both inside and outside Hollywood. Folks inside the movie and TV industry have fiercely pushed back against the use of AI to replace the skilled artists and actors who create the media we watch. That concern obviously comes from a place of self-interest because nobody wants to be pushed out of a job. But they also care about the quality of the work being produced. And there’s also been a revolt among the average consumer, people who’ve been inundated with the lowest-grade AI garbage imaginable. It’s really everywhere now.\n\nThe first episode, titled “The Flag,” is three-and-a-half minutes long and attempts to tell the story of George Washington raising the Continental Union Flag in Somerville, Massachusetts. It offers nothing compelling in the way of narrative. It’s the kind of thing that you’d skip over as a cut-scene in a particularly bad video game.\n\nEverything has a dead and creepy quality, as the actors’ audio is poorly synced with the lips of the AI concoctions.\n\nHave you ever seen a Spaghetti Western from the 1960s where the audio just doesn’t seem to match, even though it was clearly shot with actors speaking English, and the “dub” is in English? That happened because the audio was added in post-production, a result of direct sound recording being expensive in Italy during the post-war era. You get the same effect here, though there’s no good reason. Well, no good reason outside of presumably saving a ton of money on hiring human actors.\n\nThe second episode, titled “Common Sense,” tries to tell the story of Thomas Paine writing Common Sense. Benjamin Franklin makes an appearance, though it proves that the most recognizable of the founding fathers in this series are the weirdest to look at.\n\nThe episode jumps around incoherently, much like the first episode, without grounding the viewer in anything we should care about. It’s truly an ugly mess. And if you bother to pause the scenes, you can spot the kind of telltale anomalies that plague other AI-generated video projects, like strangely deformed hands in the background characters. Hands are always giving this stuff away.\n\nThen there are the words that appear on screen in the trailer, like the pamphlet that’s supposed to include the word “America” but instead reads something closer to “Λamereedd.”\n\nHappy to see that there is no need to worry about the historical accuracy of new 1776 AI slop because it happens in the mystical land of Λamereedd.\n\n— Mateusz Fafinski (@calthalas.bsky.social) January 29, 2026 at 1:33 PM\n\nThe series is specifically made for this sestercentennial year of America’s founding, and each episode will reportedly drop on the 250th anniversary of the day it happened, according to the Hollywood Reporter. And that’s certainly a fun concept if the final product were something worth watching. But it’s not. It’s garbage. The people who are making and distributing it obviously don’t think so.\n\n“This project is a glimpse at what thoughtful, creative, artist-led use of AI can look like — not replacing craft, but expanding what’s possible and allowing storytellers to go places they simply couldn’t before,” Ben Bitonti, president of Time Studios, told the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe reaction on social media hasn’t been so kind. “I know my expectations were low but holy fuck Darren Aronofsky producing AI slop wasn’t on my bingo card,” one X user wrote. Over on Bluesky another joked, “Used to be that when Darren Aronofsky wanted to feature a dead-eyed actor, he’d just employ Jared Leto.”\n\nAnd other users have been picking apart all the anomalies, with one Bluesky critic writing: “Love the new Aronofsky scene where the colonist takes off his hat to cheer, revealing that underneath it was a second and somehow larger hat.”\n\nLove the new Aronofsky scene where the colonist takes off his hat to cheer, revealing that underneath it was a second and somehow larger hat\n Masterful artsistic choice\n\n— Matt Baume 🏳️‍🌈 (@mattbaume.bsky.social) January 29, 2026 at 10:35 AM\n\n“Nothing represents The End of America after a 250-year run quite like using AI slop to depict the creation of the Declaration of Independence,” another user quipped.\n\nThe videos have been up at Time’s YouTube channel for over 7 hours as of the time of this writing, but they’re not gaining much attention in their original format. The first episode has just 5,000 views. The second episode has a little over 2,000. Social media posts ridiculing the production seem to be faring better, simply because people are making fun of them. One video on Bluesky has over 2,500 quote posts, with almost all seemingly making jokes about how awful it looks.\n\nGizmodo reached out to Ken Burns for comment, but didn’t immediately receive a reply.",

    "description": "I compared 28 of the best cashmere sweaters, from budget brands to luxe investment pieces. My favorites are soft, insulating, and easy to care for.",
    "fullText": "Cashmere is a thin, soft, and finely textured knit fabric made from the fibers brushed from the undercoat of cashmere goats. It gets its name from the Kashmir region of northern India and is distinct from the fibers harvested from sheep that make wool. Even though they're related materials, cashmere is three times more insulating than wool. It's also naturally more breathable.\n\nThe more expensive a cashmere sweater is, the more you can denote from its laborious brushing and production process.\n\nCashmere is only collected as little as once a year, depending on the area, and it can take approximately 4-5 fully grown cashmere goats to make just one sweater. The goats' hair is brushed into \"tops.\" Luxury brands like Loro Piana and Brunello Cucinelli bid on the premium tops, which are the cleanest and palest in color.\n\nIn the US, cashmere must meet a certain criteria:\n\n100% cashmere is more sustainable than, say, polyester. Still, it does take a toll on the environment, and the available quantity relies on the well-being of goat herds, their habitat, and their caretakers. As with any naturally regenerative resource, paying more means investing in the quality of life for those who produce it.\n\nCashmere is graded according to the diameter and length of the fibers. Grade A cashmere uses ultra-fine fibers that are a minimum of 14 microns thick, which feel softer and resist pilling better. Grades B and C cashmere uses thicker fibers that feel less smooth.\n\nCashmere sweaters can last you a lifetime with the right care. Hanging cashmere sweaters will make them stretch, so you should instead keep them folded in a drawer. But beware: this is exactly where hungry moths can be found lying in wait. Keep them at bay with cedar blocks to prevent them from chewing holes through your cashmere clothing.\n\n\"Gauge\" refers to the number of stitches per inch. A higher gauge usually means a lighter fabric. 16-gauge sweaters feel smoother and have a more structured finish, which is ideal for workwear and layering. Looser gauges, like a 5-gauge, have a more casual fit, but may stretch out faster. If you prefer these, look for those with ribbing around cuffs and hems which should help maintain its shape.\n\n\"Ply\" refers to the number of yarn strands twisted together. The higher the ply, the more thick the fabric. 2-ply cashmere is warmer and more dense than single-ply. Single-ply sweaters have that delicate, airy feel, but 2-ply offers a better balance between softness and structure in the long run.",

    "description": "Jeffrey Epstein's victims have accused Bank of America of facilitating Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking operation.",
    "fullText": "Sex trafficking victims of Jeffrey Epstein scored a mixed victory in court on Thursday after a federal judge tossed one of their lawsuits against a bank — but greenlit part of another case against a different bank.\n\nUS District Judge Jed Rakoff allowed portions of a proposed class-action lawsuit filed by victims against Bank of America to move forward, but dismissed other parts of the case.\n\nRakoff dismissed the entirety of a similar lawsuit the victims had filed against another bank, BNY.\n\nThe Epstein victims had accused Bank of America of ignoring red flags for Epstein's sex-trafficking operation. Their lawsuit said the bank facilitated millions of dollars — including over $170 million from former Apollo CEO Leon Black, who said he paid Epstein for tax advice — into Epstein's accounts. They said the funds were used in part to pay hush money to victims.\n\nRakoff dismissed the parts of the lawsuit that alleged the bank \"knowingly participated\" in Epstein's sex-trafficking operation, as well as allegations that it failed to follow know-your-customer laws in monitoring Epstein's accounts.\n\nBut the judge allowed the victims' claims that Bank of America was a \"knowing beneficiary\" of the sex-trafficking operation to move forward.\n\nThe judge tossed an entire lawsuit that the same lawyers filed against BNY, also known as Bank of New York Mellon Corp. The lawsuit had alleged BNY ignored red flags while processing Epstein's wire transfers and by extending credit to a modeling agency financed by Epstein and owned by Jean-Luc Brunel, who died in his prison cell in 2022 while awaiting trial in France for rape charges.\n\nDavid Boies, an attorney representing the Epstein victims, said he would appeal the dismissal of the BNY lawsuit.\n\n\"We are pleased that the Court sustained our sex trafficking claims against Bank of America, and we look forward to trying that case in May,\" Boies said in a statement. \"We respectively disagree with the Court's dismissal of the complaint against Bank of New York Mellon and we will seek appellate review.\"\n\nRakoff had expressed skepticism about the strength of both lawsuits during a December hearing in his lower Manhattan courtroom. He called them both \"a model of high-pitched rhetoric\" and compared them unfavorably to earlier lawsuits the same attorneys had brought on behalf of Epstein victims against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, which settled for $290 million and $75 million, respectively.\n\nAt the end of the December hearing, Rakoff gave the lawyers two weeks to file amended versions of their lawsuits with more detail.\n\nThe revisions appeared not to satisfy Rakoff. He dismissed the counts \"with prejudice\" — meaning the lawyers won't get another chance to amend their lawsuits — and said he would issue an opinion explaining his reasoning by February 13.\n\n\"We are pleased with the court's decision dismissing the lawsuit in its entirety, which reinforces that BNY had no involvement in Epstein's crimes,\" BNY spokesperson Ryan Wells told Business Insider. \"BNY has great sympathy for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein and believes his crimes should be fully investigated and prosecuted.\"\n\nIn court, Bank of America lawyers said it offered nothing more than \"routine banking services\" for Epstein. Bill Haldin, a spokesperson for the bank, said it looked forward to \"a full review of the facts\" as the case moved forward.\n\n\"We are pleased the court dismissed most of the claims,\" Haldin said. \"On the remaining claims, it's important to understand the underlying facts have not been reviewed at this stage of the litigation.\"\n\nRakoff had previously put the lawsuits on a fast track, setting deadlines for summary judgment for the spring, which will give Bank of America another chance to have the case dismissed. A trial is scheduled for May.\n\nThe litigation is playing out in the same courthouse where victims have pressed judges to force the Department of Justice to publish its internal files related to Epstein, the well-connected pedophile who killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex-trafficking charges.\n\nThe Justice Department has blown past a December 19 deadline required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed in November, to release all of its files. Victims and members of Congress have asked judges to appoint an independent monitor to oversee the release of the files. Judges have said they don't have the power to make such an appointment.\n\nIn a court filing Tuesday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the department had reviewed \"millions of pages of materials, applying redactions as appropriate\" and would publish them \"in the near term.\"",

    "fullText": "The founder of an auto parts company whose bankruptcy rattled Wall Street and prompted a debate about private credit has been charged with fraud.\n\nManhattan federal prosecutors on Thursday charged Patrick James and his brother Edward James in a multibillion-dollar fraud scheme that they allege involved years of fake invoices and the double- and even triple-pledging of assets.\n\nPatrick James is the founder and former CEO of auto parts maker First Brands, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September. Its bankruptcy was followed by the collapse of subprime auto-lender Tricolor Holdings, sparking a broader debate about the health of the credit market that drew in JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.\n\nHis brother had been a senior executive at the company.\n\nThe two men were charged with wire fraud, bank fraud, and conspiracy, including money laundering conspiracy. Patrick James faces an additional count, stemming from allegations that he ran a continuing financial crimes enterprise. A third former executive, Peter Andrew Brumbergs, has pleaded guilty in the case.\n\nProsecutors said the men inflated invoices, repeatedly pledged the same assets as collateral for loans, and falsified corporate financial statements in a series of schemes that yielded billions of dollars in financing.\n\nA spokesperson for Patrick James said he denies the charges.\n\n\"He built First Brands from nothing,\" the spokesperson said, adding, \"Mr. James looks forward to presenting his case in court.\"\n\nEdward James's lawyer issued a statement blasting his client's arrest in Ohio as \"needless theater.\"\n\n\"We look forward to appearing in New York on his behalf, and we have complete confidence in Mr. James,\" the lawyer, Seth DuCharme, said.\n\nJefferies and UBS are among the financial firms that have acknowledged exposure to First Brands.\n\n\"The James brothers obtained billions for First Brands — and millions for themselves — by presenting their lenders with the impression of a successful, growing international business,\" Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton said in a statement.",

    "description": "In a hearing, a judge advised YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson and Virtual Dining Concepts to settle their legal dispute over MrBeast Burger.",
    "fullText": "A judge urged MrBeast and his burger business partner to settle their legal battle to avoid airing \"dirty laundry\" — but paved the way for the case to go to trial.\n\nAt a hearing on Thursday, New York County Supreme Court Judge Jennifer Schecter appeared skeptical about the damages sustained by either side, both of which are suing the other. Despite that, she ruled that both cases could proceed.\n\nVDC said it looked \"forward to having our day in court.\" MrBeast's reps declined to comment.\n\nYouTube's top star, MrBeast (real name Jimmy Donaldson), launched MrBeast Burger, a largely delivery-only venture selling burgers and fried chicken sandwiches, with Virtual Dining Concepts in 2020. Donaldson hoped it would become the cornerstone of a food empire, but the partnership was plagued by tensions over undercooked orders and Donaldson's demands for more control of the business.\n\nIn July 2023, Donaldson's company sued VDC, portraying the YouTuber as a victim seeking to escape an unfair contract that had tarnished his reputation as a philanthropic, family-friendly entertainer. VDC fired back with its own lawsuit, saying Donaldson had walked away from a promising deal and failed to meet various contractual obligations, including appearances and promos.\n\nA big issue for the judge was the level of damages claimed by both sides. She said the evidence presented by MrBeast about bad Yelp reviews over MrBeast Burger orders seemed \"very compelling.\" But she said she was \"very skeptical\" that they \"would materially and irreparably harm the MrBeast brand under the circumstances.\"\n\nThe judge took special interest in MrBeast's argument that VDC owes him royalties over burger sales.\n\nVDC says MrBeast's camp instructed the company to reinvest his royalty share back into the business. MrBeast's side says it's entitled to royalties now that the partnership has fallen apart.\n\nThe judge urged the parties to think about seeking a business solution rather than a legal one, given the cost of fighting the case in court.\n\n\"If they can't take each other anymore, they should be thinking about a buyout, and it may be costly, but at the end of the day, maybe that's what these parties both should want,\" she said.\n\nThe judge also admitted some fascination with the case involving the world's biggest YouTuber and his ill-fated business venture.\n\nDuring the hour-and-a-half hearing, MrBeast's lawyer, Steven Marenberg, alleged that the burger complaints harmed the YouTuber's reputation.\n\nHe said the \"systemic, deep\" dissatisfaction with MrBeast Burger could \"impact, irreparably,\" the YouTuber's brand.\n\nShawn Rabin, VDC's lawyer, countered by claiming that MrBeast wanted to lower the value of the business so he could \"buy it on the cheap\" and take control of it.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has insisted he’s a “kind” and “gentle” person while in the same breath blasting one of his very own appointees as a “moron.”\n\nThe president’s comments came as part of a confused and rambling Truth Social tirade posted early Thursday morning. “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell again refused to cut interest rates, even though he has absolutely no reason to keep them so high,” Trump began.\n\nThe MAGA leader has repeatedly lambasted Powell, who he appointed as chairman of the Federal Reserve in 2018, for refusing to follow White House instructions on interest rates. Wednesday’s announcement is the first time since July that rates have not been cut.\n\n“He is hurting our Country, and its National Security,” Trump wrote. “We should have a substantially lower rate now that even this moron admits inflation is no longer a problem or threat. He is costing America Hundreds of Billions of Dollar a year in totally unnecessary and uncalled for INTEREST EXPENSE.”\n\nPowell has not said that inflation is not a problem. He said in December only that it has inched closer to the Fed’s target level, and otherwise insisted the U.S. faces risks from multiple stressors, such as low job growth and economic uncertainty.\n\nTrump appeared eager to push those and any other fiscal concerns under the rug on Thursday. “Because of the vast amounts of money flowing into our Country because of Tariffs, we should be paying the LOWEST INTEREST RATE OF ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD,” he wrote.\n\nThe MAGA leader has repeatedly used hyperbole regarding claims about tariff revenue under his second administration. There is a broad consensus among economists that such levies are not a durable solution to fiscal crises, as higher costs inevitably shift to consumers over time.\n\n“Most of these countries are low interest rate paying cash machines, thought of as elegant, solid, and prime, only because the U.S.A. allows them to be,” Trump went on. “The Tariffs being charged to them, while bringing in $BILLIONS to us, still allows most of them to have a significant trade surplus, though much smaller, with our beautiful, formerly abused Country.”\n\n“In other words, I have been very nice, kind, and gentle to countries all over the World,” he concluded, before demanding again the Fed should “substantially lower interest rates, NOW!”\n\nEarlier this month, Powell made headlines when he defied Trump by releasing a video message regarding a criminal investigation opened by the Department of Justice into the renovation of the Central Bank’s headquarters.\n\n“I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law,” Powell said in his video message. “But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment on this story.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk took the final moments of Tesla's earnings call to warn American companies about global battery supply risks.\n\nTesla has built its own lithium refinery and battery facility to avoid disruptions: \"We wish others would build this,\" Musk said.\n\nRecent studies show renewed interest in building the facilities — but construction has slowed.\n\n\"Can other people, please, for the love of God, in the name of all that is holy, can others please build this stuff?\"\n\nElon Musk made the plea in the final moments of Tesla's earnings call on Wednesday, sounding a bit fired up.\n\nMusk had just finished giving a blunt warning to American companies: build more battery-making infrastructure in the US or risk falling behind.\n\nThe Tesla CEO argued that too many companies are underestimating their exposure to geopolitical risks posed by fragile supply chains, particularly for critical materials used in electric vehicles and energy storage.\n\n\"There are so many companies out there that are asleep at the switch with regard to geopolitical risk — or they just have their head in the sand and hope nothing bad will happen,\" Musk said. \"I'm way more paranoid than that.\"\n\nHe added that his concern has pushed Tesla to take unusual — and expensive — steps to protect its future, including building its own lithium-refining and battery-production facilities in Texas.\n\nIn December 2024, the company began processing lithium from its $1 billion Robstown, Texas, refinery. This month, Tesla announced it is producing dry-electrode 4680 cells with both anode and cathode made in Austin, which will end up in \"certain Model Ys.\"\n\nOn the call, Musk described those facilities as \"more advanced than anything else in the world,\" but stressed that Tesla does not want to be the only company making such investments.\n\n\"Why do we have to build these things? Why can others not also please build these things? I mean, it's very hard to build these things, and we're building them out of desperation, because nobody else is building lithium refineries and cathode refineries,\" Musk said.\n\n\"You know, we're pretty much the largest, but also the only lithium refinery and cathode refinery in America,\" he added. \"So, yeah. So. We're making moves to make sure that, no matter what happens, Tesla will prosper.\"\n\nIndependent research suggests Musk's worries are not unfounded.\n\nAn October analysis by the Dallas Federal Reserve identified 66 lithium projects across the US, but found that many remain in early development stages and face long timelines, high costs, and volatile lithium prices. Many projects could take a decade or more to reach commercial production, if they get there at all, the study found.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's SpaceX and xAI are in discussions to merge ahead of a blockbuster public offering planned for later this year. The combination would bring Musk’s rockets, Starlink satellites, the X social media platform and Grok AI chatbot under one roof, according to a person briefed on the matter and two ​recent company filings seen by Reuters.\n\nHow could space-based data centers reduce AI costs?\n\nWhat would the proposed SpaceX-xAI merger involve?\n\nWhat defense applications are planned for merged companies?\n\nWhy is Musk combining his different business ventures?\n\nThe plan, which Reuters is reporting exclusively, would give fresh momentum to SpaceX’s effort to launch data centers into orbit as Musk battles for supremacy in the rapidly ‌escalating AI race against tech giants like Google, Meta and OpenAI.\n\nMusk, the world's richest man, is the CEO of both the private space company SpaceX and the artificial intelligence company xAI, which controls his social media platform X. He also runs electric automaker Tesla, tunnel ‌company The Boring Co. and neurotechnology company Neuralink.\n\nMusk, SpaceX, and xAI did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nUnder the proposed merger, shares of xAI would be exchanged for shares in SpaceX. Two entities have been set up in Nevada to facilitate the transaction, the person said.\n\nCorporate filings in Nevada show that those entities were set up on January 21. One of them, a limited liability company, lists SpaceX and Bret Johnsen, the company's chief financial officer, as managing members, while the other lists Johnsen as the company's only officer, the filings show.\n\nThe filings don't contain additional information about the purpose of the companies ⁠or their role in any deal.\n\nJohnsen did not respond to a Reuters ‌request for comment.\n\nThe person, who requested anonymity because the discussions are confidential, said that some xAI executives could be given the option to receive cash instead of SpaceX stock as part of the deal. A final agreement, however, hasn't been signed, and the timing and structure of the transaction remain fluid, the person cautioned.\n\nSpaceX is already the world's most ‍valuable privately held company, last valued at $800 billion in a recent insider share sale. xAI was valued at $230 billion in November, according to the Wall Street Journal. Reuters and other media have reported that SpaceX plans to go public some time this year, with a valuation expected above $1 trillion.\n\nThrough xAI, Musk is building out a massive supercomputer for AI training in Memphis, Tennessee, called Colossus. Last year, SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI as part of the startup’s $5 billion equity ​fundraising, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time.",

    "fullText": "If you own gold or silver right now, you probably feel smart and slightly anxious at the same time.\n\nI’ve been following this move tick‑by‑tick, and the most striking thing is how calm Jerome Powell sounds compared with what gold and silver are actually doing.\n\nGold has climbed toward $5,600 an ounce after roughly a 64% jump last year, according to the Economic Times. The report also highlights Silver's sprint toward the 120‑dollar level as investment demand, industrial use, and tight supply collide.\n\nAt the same press conference where those price moves were hanging over the market, Powell told reporters “not to take much message macroeconomically” about the significant price increases of precious metals, as highlighted in a clip posted on Cointelegraph’s X (formerly Twitter) page.\n\nThat single line is the clearest view you’re going to get into how the Fed thinks about this metals spike.\n\nWhat really set people off wasn’t just that gold is at record levels. It was the way Powell tried to separate that price action from the Fed’s reaction function.\n\n“Jerome Powell says not to read much into the rise in gold prices,” Cointelegraph captioned the clip on X during the press conference, paraphrasing his answer to a question about the metal’s surge.\n\nMeanwhile, the moves have been anything but minor.\n\nGold recently broke above $5,000 per ounce on safe‑haven demand tied to geopolitical tensions and uncertainty about future Fed policy, even before it extended toward the 5,600‑dollar region, according to Plus500.\n\nMarket uncertainty resets silver, gold bets\n\nBillionaire Dalio sends 2-word warning on markets\n\nEvery major analyst’s gold price forecast for 2026\n\nThe combination of rate‑cut expectations, geopolitical stress and central‑bank diversification has driven precious metals to record or near‑record levels, while sharp pullbacks remain a real threat after such a steep rise, according to CME Group analysis.\n\nWhen I put those pieces together, it feels like the Fed is quietly saying, “We see it, but we’re not going to let gold bully us,” which is not the message metals traders wanted to hear.\n\nIf Powell was trying to calm things down, it didn’t work on the hard‑money crowd. Peter Schiff, who has been hammering the case for gold and silver for years, immediately framed the market’s reaction as a referendum on the Fed.",

    "fullText": "(FOX40.COM) — A former Oak Ridge High School band teacher accused of child sex crimes made his first appearance on Wednesday in El Dorado County Superior Court.\n\nPaul Varoff was arrested on Monday and is now facing 10 felony counts related to sexual acts he committed with a person under the age of 18, including one instance that allegedly happened in his school office.\n\nAccording to the El Dorado County Sheriff’s Office, Varoff taught at Oak Ridge High School for over 30 years.\n\nAt his arraignment hearing, Varoff appeared handcuffed and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit. He did not enter a plea; instead, he waived his right to a speedy arraignment while he seeks private representation.\n\nA new arraignment hearing has been scheduled for Feb. 12.\n\nThe sheriff’s office said that the criminal complaint obtained by FOX40, Varoff faces five counts of oral copulation of a person under 18 and five counts of sexual penetration of a person under 18, stemming from seven alleged incidents between January 1, 2023, and August 31, 2023.\n\nThe prosecution further alleges several aggravating factors. Those include that the victim was particularly vulnerable, Varoff’s conduct involved planning and sophistication and that the former teacher abused a position of trust and confidence.\n\nThe criminal complaint also states that the offenses occurred at multiple locations, including Varoff’s residence in Sacramento County and his school office in El Dorado County.\n\nVaroff will remain behind bars at the El Dorado County Jail, where he’s being held without bail. But the El Dorado County Sheriff’s Office says this remains an active and ongoing investigation.\n\nThey encourage any potential additional victims or anyone with information related to the case to contact Detective Katz by emailing katzt@eldoradosheriff.gov or calling 530-642-4716.",

    "title": "Senator demands answers after Trump accepted Rolex and gold bar before slashing tariffs on Switzerland",
    "description": "Trump’s love of lavish gifts is well known and many are displayed in the Oval Office",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is being asked to provide more information about the Rolex watch and gold bar he accepted from Swiss businessmen last year, shortly before agreeing to lower tariffs on Swiss goods, by the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nOregon Senator Ron Wyden is seeking more details to determine whether the president violated laws by accepting the gifts before cutting the deal, according to the letter seen by Bloomberg.\n\nIn November, a delegation of Swiss businessmen visited the White House to speak with Trump after he imposed a 39 percent tariff on Swiss goods. Shortly thereafter, a Rolex table clock, which does not appear to be available for purchase by the general public, appeared on the president’s desk.\n\nIn addition, a custom gold bar was displayed on the Resolute Desk, worth more than $130,000, according to Wyden’s office.\n\nLess than two weeks later, Trump announced a deal that reduced Swiss tariffs from 39 percent – the highest tariff placed on any Western country – to 15 percent. The Swiss tariffs remain at this rate.\n\nAt the time, the White House said the gifts were donations to Trump’s future presidential library, complied with U.S. and Swiss laws and were cleared by the White House legal counsel.\n\nIn his letter, Wyden wrote: “Trump’s acceptance of gifts of significant monetary value just days before lowering tariffs on goods from Switzerland creates a blatant conflict of interest and possible constitutional violations.”\n\nThe Independent has asked Senator Wyden’s office for comment.\n\nThe foreign and domestic emoluments clauses are some of the U.S.’s oldest anticorruption buffers. Under the Foreign Emoluments Clause, federal officials are prohibited from accepting a present, office, title or payment from another head of state without the consent of Congress.\n\nWyden also questioned whether Swiss negotiators informed U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer of the gifts before or after presenting them to Trump and which administration official recommended the new, lower tariff rate.\n\nThe White House pushed back on suggestions of a conflict of interest.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement: “Switzerland secured a trade deal and lower tariffs by reducing their unfair trade barriers and committing to invest billions in the United States.\n\n“The only special interest guiding President Trump’s decision-making is the best interest of the American people, and any suggestion otherwise is completely unfounded. President Trump is an extraordinarily successful businessman who can afford his own Swiss table clock.”\n\nTrump’s decision to slap a 39 percent tariff on Switzerland in August stunned the country’s officials, since the U.S. is the top export destination for Swiss goods such as pharmaceuticals, luxury watches and precious metals.\n\nWhile in Davos last week, Trump said he imposed the tariff at a higher rate because he was “rubbed the wrong way” by former Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter. Subsequently, Swiss officials reportedly struggled to convince the president to lower the tariff rate before the delegation of businessmen helped thaw tensions, according to Reuters.\n\nTrump has a well-known love for lavish, personalized gifts, which has raised questions about presidential ethics. Lawmakers and nonprofit organizations have said that the appearance of accepting such gifts leads to concerns about quid-pro-quos or giving certain countries preferential treatment as a result.\n\n“This affair also creates a perception that lavishing gifts on the President, rather than negotiating with [US Trade Representative] is the best way for trading partners to engage with the United States,” Wyden wrote.\n\nOver the last year, Trump has publicly accepted a gold crown from South Korea, a 24-karat gold and glass plaque from Apple CEO Tim Cook, the “FIFA Peace Prize” from FIFA President Gianni Infantino, a gold pager from Israel, a portrait from Russian President Vladimir Putin of the leaders together and a $400 million luxury Boeing 747 jet from Qatar to serve as the new Air Force One, before being transferred to his presidential library.",

    "description": "Growing up in the 21st century is no joke.",
    "fullText": "Zendaya is busy. Euphoria, which she produces in addition to starring in, is finally set to return for its third season on April 12, four years after our last visit to East Highland, and nearly seven since it premiered.\n\nAs frustrating as these between-season breaks can be, they leave plenty of time to explore other tales of the wild lives of high schoolers. It's all relative, though: While growing up in never a picnic, there's drama, and then there's drama. These 15 streamalikes vary widely in tone and style, but they all make clear that being a young person in the 21st century is not f*cking easy. Stream the first two seasons of Euphoria on HBO Max.\n\nKimberly (Pauline Chalamet) is an endlessly naïve scholarship student; Bela (Amrit Kaur) is an aspiring comedy writer on the make for the hottest guys; Whitney (Alyah Chanelle Scott) is an overachieving athlete and senator’s daughter;and Leighton (Reneé Rapp) is a closeted sorority girl. They're all randomly assigned to room together as freshmen at the fictional Essex College in Vermont. Created by Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble, this comedy-drama isn't nearly as salacious as its title suggests. There's sex for sure, but like Sex and the City before it, the funny, queer-friendly show is more about female friendship. Stream The Sex Lives of College Girls on HBO Max.\n\nPeriod drama is having a moment, and this one goes way, way back...to the 1990s. This British comedy-drama stars the brilliant Sharon Rooney (you might know her as Lawyer Barbie) as Rae Earl, a 16-year-old who just spent several months in a psychiatric hospital for a cocktail of mental health issues, poor body image being near the top of that list. Heading back to school, she tries to conceal the truth of her absence and ongoing challenges—with expectedly mixed results. Despite the show's comedy elements, it's about as good a narrative about growing up with serious mental health issues as you're likely to find. Rooney won a well-deserved Best Actress BAFTA for her performance. Stream My Mad Fat Diary on Prime Video, Hulu, and Tubi.\n\nThis British import feels a bit like a latter-day Skins, featuring a scholastic setting and a talented cast of young stars-in-waiting (including leads Josh Tedeku and Jodie Campbell). At the (fictional) prestigious boarding school St. Gilbert’s, five Black teens are newly attending on scholarships, but their integration into the existing cliques is less than smooth. The blend of coming-of-age drama with a willingness to take the piss when it comes to the whole \"rich private school thing\" makes this Tubi original a smashing good time. Stream Boarders on Tubi.\n\nTeen drama at its finest and most bitchy, Gossip Girl follows the many scandals of a group of young Upper East Side socialites and hangers-on. The tangled teenage lives of Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively), her best frenemy Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester), scholarship kid Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley), and plenty more pretty young boys and girls are chronicled in meticulous detail by the title's mysterious, omnipresent Gossip Girl (voiced by Kristen Bell). This one shares with Emily an impeccable sense of style, as its leads never miss a fashion beat. It all seems a bit tame when help up to Euphoria, but the show carved a path nonetheless, scandalizing parents in the mid-aughts. (The two-season 2021 follow-up is also available on HBO Max.) Stream Gossip Girl on HBO Max and Netflix.\n\nAndrea and Marco are twin brothers (both played by Mattia Carrano) with a broad circle of friends living in modern day Italy. Marco has a history of self-harm that impacted his burgeoning swimming career, while Andrea has a secret social media life,messaging men while presenting as a woman. Sexual and gender exploration is the prime mover here, but the show also deals realistically with issues like drugs and bullying and any number of other coming-of-age trials. A bit of a hidden gem. Stream Prisma on Prime Video.\n\nWith a bit of Gossip Girl’s juicy style, Elite follows a group of working-class friends who wind up with scholarships to Las Encinas, a fictional private school that is, in the show’s universe, the most exclusive in Spain. What they find there is snobbery, for sure, but also mystery, murder, and lots and lots of sex (between and among characters of various sexual orientations and numerical groupings). The smart, wonderfully trashy show ran for an almost shocking (in our modern streaming era) eight seasons, with a couple of regional remakes. Stream Elite on Netflix.\n\nThis top-tier teen drama stars Ama Qamata as Puleng Khumalo, a teenage girl who’s lived her entire life in the shadow of a sister who was taken as a baby by human traffickers (Puleng’s parents still hold a birthday celebration for the sister each year). When invited to a party by popular Fikile Bhele (Khosi Ngema), a student at an elite school in Cape Town, Puleng can’t help noticing their similarities. Steeped in the story of her sister, Puleng transfers to the school to get to the bottom of things. There’s plenty of juicy high school drama and family secrets in the mix, but the show is elevated by its unexpected dramatic heft and a multitude of queer characters and storylines. (This is ostensibly a South Africa remake of Elite, but its flavor and sense of identity are so unique that you'd hardly notice.) Stream Blood & Water on Netflix.\n\nComedian Benito Skinner plays himself, sort of, in this buzzy comedy that sees a former high school jock facing his freshman year in college while desperately trying to convince himself and everyone else that he's as straight as they come (relatable, except for the jock part). Much of the appeal is in its deft blending of tones: It's a frequently raunchy college comedy and simultaneously a sweet coming-of-age story about accepting yourself without worrying about what everyone else thinks. The cast includes Adam DiMarco (The White Lotus) and Rish Shah (Ms. Marvel) and while it definitely doesn't go as hard as Euphoria, there are moments of real drama and heartbreak. Stream Overcompensating on Prime Video.\n\nMany of us come from families with philosophies that could be described as less than sex positive. Which is not great. This popular British series imagines the life of a teenager with a parent on the opposite end of that spectrum: Mom (Gillian Anderson) is a sex therapist who’s not particularly good at romantic relationships. As a result, Asa Butterfield’s Otis Milburn grew up with an ambivalence toward the topic—a lack of interest that held until he realized that his inside knowledge of doing the deed could earn him friends (and paying customers) at school. Alongside some classmates, he establishes his own clinic to help his fellow students with their sexual concerns. In the process, Otis, and the show, address a wide range of issues, from birth control and abortion, to masturbation, sexually transmitted diseases, and developing sexual identities. Emma Mackey and Ncuti Gatwa (Doctor Who) also star. Stream Sex Education on Netflix.\n\nIndustry isn’t concerned with a power struggle among people at the top of the ladder; instead, its focus is the fight to climb said ladder. The young wannabe investment bankers it follows would all love to be the terrible rich people from that other show. The main characters come from a variety of backgrounds, but they’re all competing for a limited number of permanent positions at the fictional Pierpoint & Co., a London bank, and they’ll do anything it takes to earn their shot at the big prize. The setting here is seemingly very different from Euphoria's vague greater Los Angeles, and the whole investment banking thing hardly doesn't line up with the trials of high school, but there's a a definite vibe match, as young people face high pressure situations and fight to stay above water in a world rife with traps and temptations. Stream Industry on HBO Max.\n\nDirector Luca Guadagnino (Challengers, Queer) created this series about two American teenagers, Fraser (Jack Dylan Grazer) and Caitlin (Jordan Kristine Seamón), living with their families on a U.S. military base in Chioggia, Italy. Fraser's two moms are both in the army, but he's new to base life. Caitlin, on the other hand, has lived in Chioggia for years with her conservative father. Over the course of a summer, the two gradually bond over their mutual feelings of isolation, as well as their explorations of gender and sexuality. Stream We Are Who We Are on HBO Max.\n\nAs with many teen dramas, Baby kicks off at an elite boarding school (poor kids come of age too, ya know), but this one has a fairly wild spin: It's based (quite loosely) on a real-life Italian scandal involving teen sex workers. Benedetta Porcaroli (Immaculate) stars as Chiara, a rich kid who makes a new bestie in Ludovica (Alice Pagani), who needs money and happens to know a very sketchy guy who might be able to help her earn it. The tone is somehow less lascivious than the premise suggests, although the sex-work-as-teenage-rebellion angle is not for every taste. Stream Baby on Netflix.\n\nThere’s a lot of backstory here that you don’t really need to know to enjoy the show, but in brief, Heartbreak High is a sorta soft-reboot of a popular and long-running 1990s show in Australia, which was itself a spin-off from a 1993 movie. There’s a solid blend of teen drama (sealing with issues related to gender identity, race, and teen sexuality) and comedy (the main characters corralled into the Sexual Literacy Tutorial, with the unfortunate acronym SLT). It all starts with Amelie and Harper, two students at a diverse Sydney high school, who set off a firestorm when they create a detailed map of the sexual exploits of the student body. Stream Heartbreak High on Netflix.\n\n\"What the hell is this doing here?\" you're probably asking yourself. And, fair. But hear me out: This reimagining of the once entirely wholesome Archie comics universe is generally way over-the-top, but it tackles the trials and tribulations of growing up (including recurring storylines involving substance abuse) in a similarly...let's say \"operatic\" fashion. It veers wildly between genres, starting out by blending several coming-of-age storylines with a hot-for-teacher whodunnit: The dour, elderly Miss Grundy of the comics is younged up and is having an affair with Archie in the series opener, leading in to a bloody murder mystery. Before long, we're folding in supernatural horror and alternate universes, things made all the weirder by the way the show seems to take itself absolutely seriously in the face of one bonkers plot twist after another. It's the whackadoo comic-book version of Euphoria. Steam Riverdale on Netflix.\n\nThe popular and controversial British series launched names like Nicholas Hoult, Daniel Kaluuya, and Dev Patel while dealing with hot-button issues like mental illness, substance abuse, and bullying. The show also never forgets—not even for one episode—that it's about teenagers, and doesn't shy away from the sex lives of its large (and ever-changing) cast of characters. There's a pretty straight line to be drawn between the success of Skins and that of Euphoria. Stream Skins on Hulu.",

    "title": "Seven Products to Protect Your House From Snow and Ice Damage",
    "description": "Freezing temperatures, a blanket of snow, and accumulating ice can do a lot of damage.",
    "fullText": "When the cold weather arrives, there’s a tendency among homeowners to focus on the interior—namely, our personal comfort and the utility bills. That’s perfectly sensible—no one wants to shiver in their own house, and no one wants to be slammed with an enormous utility bill, either. But the exterior of your house is just as important.\n\nHeavy snow and icy buildup during extended periods of severe cold can really take a toll on your house. Snow and ice combined with melt/freeze cycles during sunny periods can do some serious (and often completely silent) damage to your home in a variety of ways, from water intrusion through your roof to ice-heavy tree branches crashing into the house. If you live somewhere where you can expect to be buried in snow and ice at some point this winter, here are the products you need to protect your house.\n\nSnow is heavy, and your roof is designed to handle only so much of it. The chances that your roof is going to collapse are probably pretty minimal, but that doesn’t mean letting a ton of snow and ice sit on it for weeks at a time is good for your roof or the structure under it. At the same time, climbing up onto your roof to shovel or sweep snow off is not the safest thing to do. Instead, keep a snow rake on hand. Designed to be used from the ground, a snow rake is a simple tool that lets you scrape a lot of snow off your roof safely, easing the snow load and minimizing the chances that water will infiltrate the house. Just keep in mind that if you install roof cable to prevent ice dams (see below), you’ll need to be super careful using a roof rake, as you can easily snag the cable and yank it loose.\n\nOne often-overlooked problem caused by cold, snowy weather is ice buildup in roof and furnace vents. Sewer vents on the roof and furnace vents that draw in clean air and expel exhaust from your heating system can get clogged with ice, which can cause your heat to malfunction and pose a severe health hazard if fumes build up inside the home. A sewer skewer is a simple solution. It’s just a hunk of copper, really, but copper is an excellent conductor, so it absorbs heat from the sun (and your home’s own gases as they rise up) and radiates that heat back out, melting any snow and ice that form in the vent. It’s shaped to move the melting water away from the vent so it doesn’t just drip down and re-freeze. It’s incredibly simple to install (be careful on your roof, though) and can save you from disaster.\n\nIce dams are layers of ice that form at the edge of your roof, preventing proper drainage. Unchecked, ice dams can really do a number on your roof and even the structure of your house. Preventing ice dams can be relatively easy, however—just install some heated roof cables. Attached to the edge of your roof in a zig-zag pattern, roof cables ensure that ice dams can’t form, and melting snow and ice can drain properly into your gutters.\n\nA common way ice and freezing temperatures can damage your house is through exterior faucets and spigots. Because they extend outside the insulated interior of the house, they’re very susceptible to freezing, and that ice can make its way into the pipe behind it, leading to a burst pipe and a very expensive problem. The solution, though, is not expensive—for about $11, a faucet cover will keep your exterior faucets ice-free and water safely inside your pipes where it belongs. Affix one to every exposed faucet or spigot around the house and you’ll have one less thing to worry about.\n\nIf you have trees near your home, heavy ice and snow can snap off branches, which then smack into your roof or walls—and those ice-laden branches will be heavy when they hit your house. Being a little proactive and trimming back branches—especially old, dead ones—is the best way to prevent that from happening. If you don’t want to call a professional to trim back a few branches, pick up a mini-chainsaw to get the job done. If your branches are a little more than a mini can handle, a full-size chainsaw might be needed—but be sure you know how to handle it, especially if you’re going to be climbing a ladder to use it.\n\nLike ice dams on your roof, your gutters can become clogged with snow and ice, preventing proper drainage and leading to rot and water intrusion. Gutter heaters are an easy solution that prevents ice and snow buildup, ensuring everything drains away from your roof and your house as intended.\n\nThe freeze/melt cycle can be particularly hard on your hardscapes, including driveways and patios. Meltwater gets into small cracks and then freezes, expanding and widening those cracks. After a while, your pavement or asphalt is chewed up and needs replacing. You can do a few things to prevent (or at least slow down) this destruction. Filling cracks in asphalt or concrete as they form with a filler sealer means water can’t get into them in the first place. And sealing your asphalt or concrete surfaces will protect them during those weeks when ice is sitting there, melting and freezing over and over again as temperatures fluctuate.",

    "fullText": "Science fiction and science leaders alike have warned us that artificial intelligence may one day take over the world, but until those predictions come to pass, generative AI's biggest impact on my life has been overloading my social media feeds with slop. It seems I can't open TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube without running smack into bizarre and troubling AI concoctions featuring babies in danger and cats having affairs. It really is the wild west (or maybe Westworld) out there.\n\nI think few among us really believe these videos are any good, and it's pretty obvious they aren't good for us, or for the world. Short-form video is already numbing enough, but this AI content is generally completely devoid of any meaning or substance. And yet, it's everywhere. I haven't spent too much time on YouTube Shorts recently, but in my limited experience, the feed has been chock full of AI, especially if I'm logged out of my personal account.\n\nStill, if you're a dedicated YouTube Shorts user (or a frequent YouTube user in general) you might have noticed something odd in recent days: There don't seem to be quite as many AI videos on the platform right now. There are still a lot, don't get me wrong, but it turns out YouTube has recently taken action to remove some of its AI content—the sloppiest of the slop.\n\nAndroid Police spotted the development on Wednesday, basing its findings on a November report from Kapwing, a company that develops an online video editor. Kapwing investigated AI slop across YouTube's vast content library, noting the top 100 most-subscribed YouTube channels that publish this sort of AI content. In the two months since that report, Android Police noticed that 16 of those 100 channels are no longer with us.\n\nThat includes the most popular AI channel on YouTube, at least according to Kapwing. \"CuentosFacianantes\" had 5.95 million subscribers at the time of their initial report, and produced AI-generated shorts inspired by Dragon Ball. The channel had amassed roughly 1.28 billion views by the end of last year; despite launching in 2020, it had curated its library to begin Jan. 8, 2025, so those numbers were racked up pretty recently. The number two channel, \"Imperio de Jesus\" with 5.87 million subscribers, and the number seven channel \"Super Cat League,\" with 4.21 million subscribers, were also shut down.\n\nAccording to Android Police, the 16 channels in question had a total of 35 million subscribers and over 4.7 billion views across their collective videos. Some of these channels are completely gone, while others simply have had their videos removed.\n\nYouTube CEO Neal Mohan published a post on Jan. 21 of this year describing the company's vision for 2026. Towards the end of that letter, he acknowledges AI content, predicting that, \"AI will be a boon to the creatives who are ready to lean in,\" and comparing it to tools like Photoshop and CGI, adding \"AI will remain a tool for expression, not a replacement.\" However, Mohan was also critical of the technology, noting that it's becoming more difficult to tell real videos from AI. He notes that YouTube is now removing \"any harmful synthetic media that violates our Community Guidelines,\" and is giving creators tools to help identify and block deepfakes.\n\nMore interestingly, the letter includes a section labeled \"Managing AI slop,\" which is the first time I've seen a company like YouTube use that expression. Mohan says that YouTube's goal is to be a place where free expression thrives, but also a place \"where people feel good spending their time.\" To that point, he says, \"To reduce the spread of low quality AI content, we’re actively building on our established systems that have been very successful in combatting spam and clickbait, and reducing the spread of low quality, repetitive content.\"\n\nMohan doesn't call out any accounts by name, nor does he acknowledge the accounts and content the company has already deleted, but it's a clear line in the sand: YouTube is not against AI-generated content, but it will remove low-quality AI content it feels is, well, slop. That's good news for anyone who uses YouTube (so, pretty much everyone), even if it's far from a cure for the growing problem.\n\nI've reached out to YouTube for comment on this story, and will update this piece if I hear back.",

    "title": "You Can Now Start a Group Chat in Spotify's DMs (for Some Reason)",
    "description": "It's still wild that Spotify has DMs at all.",
    "fullText": "If you and your friends have the same taste in music, you probably text each other what you're listening to. I know when I stumble upon a new discovery I love—or even something I think is trash—I fire it off to the group chat to talk about it. Of course, I just forward the song to the group chat in the Messages app, like any other thing I'd want to send to that group. If you have Spotify, however, you have a new group chat option to choose from: Spotify itself.\n\nSpotify heads might already know that the app has had a messaging feature since August. While the point of the feature is to send Spotify content to your friends, it's a basic messaging service, which means you can send any text you want—including emojis. It's available to any Spotify user, whether you have Premium or just a free account, so long as you're 16 or older. None of that is new today.\n\nWhat is new today is the amount of people you can text at once in Spotify. Since August, chats have been limited to one-on-one interactions. Now, you're able to add up to nine other people at once to a thread. That means 10-person group chats to talk about new music, podcasts, audiobooks, or, of course, anything at all—assuming you actually want to move your DMs to Spotify.\n\nTo start, open Spotify on mobile (this isn't supported on desktop at this time) then tap your profile in the top right corner. Look for \"Messages\" at the bottom of this menu, then choose \"New Message.\" If this is your first time interacting with people on Spotify, you'll need to invite others to chat before you can craft a new message. Here, you'll have the choice to share a link to invite a friend to join your message. You can also find this option from the share menu on any piece of Spotify content, and hitting the \"Invite friends\" option.\n\nOnce you've initiated a message, you'll be able to start crafting new ones—including group chats. Head back to this Messages menu—or hit the share button on a song, podcast, or audiobook—then choose \"Create group.\" Here, tap any friends from the suggestions you'd like to add, then choose \"Create group\" again to finalize the chat. Spotify says the people that appear in the list of suggestions are those you have shared content to before, created a playlist or Blend with previously, were in a \"recent\" Jam together, or are on an active Family or Duo plan. If they don't appear, you can always choose the invite option to reach out directly.\n\nWhoever creates the group is officially its admin. As the admin, you have the power to add or remove anyone from the group chat. If you're in the group chat, you're labeled as a \"Participant.\" Invited members are labeled \"Pending.\" The admin as well as any participants are allowed to block any group chat user for any reason.\n\nThe issue is, do you really want to dedicate a group chat to Spotify itself? Maybe if this feature rolled out when the app launched way back when, it'd be different. But people are set in their ways: It's so hard to get people to move chat apps, especially when it's for one specific purpose. Rather than open yet another thread to keep track of, I think I'd rather just text links to my main group chat—and I'm guessing the other members of the chat would agree.\n\nIf you don't want to use Spotify's messaging service at all, you can leave it behind, and save yourself from getting added to all future group and one-on-one chats. To do so, tap your profile, choose \"Settings and privacy,\" then hit \"Privacy and social.\" Here, scroll down to \"Social features\" and turn off \"Messages.\"",

    "description": "\"The point is, go to the doctors for a check-up or if something is not right. It might save your life.\"",
    "fullText": "\"Last year, after four years of hell, some new extreme symptoms popped up, like shortness of breath and joint pain. A few exams and lots more bloodwork later — wham, bam, thank you ma'am — it was undiagnosed LUPUS this whole time. I've now been on treatment for four months. Always, always, ALWAYS listen to your body above anyone else!\"\n\n\"When I couldn't step out of the shower without completely losing my breath, I finally went to the ER. I was diagnosed with what the docs called the largest deep vein thrombosis (blood clot in my thigh) they had ever seen. A piece of it had migrated to my lung, creating a huge saddle pulmonary embolism.\n\nI spent four days in the ICU and underwent two separate stent procedures to get the clots dissolved. Took about six months to get back to full capacity.\n\nIn my defense, I didn't know leg pain was a symptom of a blood clot, but I shouldn't have let it go on for so long.\"\n\n\"Also can be a sign of kidney disease.\"\n\n\"Ignored this for over two years and eventually ended up in the hospital with kidney failure.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 57, Female, California\n\n—Anonymous, 20, Nonbinary, North Carolina\n\n\"I went to the emergency room the week before I was supposed to return to work from maternity leave. The ER doctor told me my blood pressure was up, but to just go to my primary and sent me on my way. I made an appointment with my primary, and she told me I went through a lot having a baby, and my body is just adjusting.\"\n\n\"I spent three days in the hospital being treated as my heart was only at 15% functionality. My poor husband was distraught, he almost lost his partner, and was sad because he couldn't spend the days with me, instead having to care for my infant. It was scary. Thankfully, I have recovered, but I will spend the rest of my life taking lots of medicine to keep my heart healthy. What I learned is to listen to your body. If something feels wrong, it very well may be, and losing your life isn't worth being afraid to go to the doctor.\"\n\n\"By the time he was willing to share this with me, and we went to a doctor who treated his illness, my husband had between 6-18 months left to live. He delayed his treatment because he thought his 'persona' would be destroyed. He became more verbal and the loving man I recalled after taking his medication. He was a better man… until he was no longer alive. He died at 67. Men, check your PSA count. Save your lives not only for yourselves, but also for those who love you.\"\n\n\"Turns out I was so severely anemic, the breathlessness and coughing weren't from asthma or bronchitis or allergies, but it was from severe anemia for many years, indicating possible heart failure. After an iron supplement and an IUD to slow heavy menstrual bleeding, I haven't had to use an inhaler or asthma medicine in almost seven years. Get your iron levels checked often if you are a female in your 30s and 40s; it can literally make your heart fail.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 47, Female, North Carolina\n\n\"The poor ER doctor lady was so nice, but I was so embarrassed. Like, she literally stuck her hand up my ass. I genuinely felt like I was in John Mulaney's skit about trying to get Xanax and ending up getting a prostate exam because he said he was lying to get prescribed drugs. Unfortunately, because I waited, it's mostly pain management now. Pay attention to rectal issues and eat your fiber! I wanna die writing this. I'm so glad it's anon.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 25, Female, Seattle, Washington\n\n\"Two surgeries, a long hospital stay, followed by a home nurse aid daily to administer intravenous antibiotics and clean the 3-inch section of flesh removed, which had to remain open for weeks for the tendons to heal. You could see my bone and all the other inside things. I have a wicked scar from it.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 63, Female, New Jersey\n\n\"I had open heart surgery soon after, and they were able to remove it. I'll be on medication forever and need to see a specialist twice a year. Had my wife not told me to go to the doctors, I'd be dead by now. This is definitely the short version of my story, but the point is, go to the doctors for a check-up or if something is not right. It might save your life.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 42, Male, Atlanta, Georgia\n\n\"Right before my 33rd birthday, my father passed, and a month before, I had gotten a divorce. So when my period came on and didn't stop after 15 days, I figured maybe my hormones were messed up since I was going through a lot emotionally. I didn't think too much about it — it'll stop eventually, I told myself. That was June of 2025; by August, I was still bleeding. It never stopped. I finally dragged myself into the doctor's office. I was in pain, I was anemic, and I showed up with photos where it looked like I was passing pure flesh the size of my hand. Something had to give.\"\n\n\"I finally got my second opinion four months later. I have endometrial cancer, and I am going to have a total hysterectomy at 33 years old next week. I'm not happy, but it's easier to process knowing what the problem is. And I can't help but wonder if someone had listened to me for all the years I was complaining, if maybe there could have been a treatment for my endometriosis before it turned cancerous.\n\nSo no, a normal cycle should not be 10-15 days per month. No, you should not feel like you are giving birth every month (cramping is normal, but it should not be so severe that you can't walk). If you are bleeding so much you have to resort to wearing a diaper — that's not normal. And if the doctor won't listen to you, make them. Don't wait until you are so anemic you need a transfusion (also not normal), and if you have every single symptom and they tell you the imaging is normal — make them get you a second opinion. Being a woman is hard, but it doesn't mean suffering in silence. Speak up.\"\n\n—Anonymous, 33, Female, Alabama\n\nAlso in Goodful: If You Can Complete More Than 15 Of These Common Phrases, Your Vocabulary Is Better Than 95% Of People’s\n\nAlso in Goodful: \"I Knew Instantly That He Would Be Dead Soon\": Doctors Are Sharing The Biggest Health Issues Patients Ignored Until It Was Too Late, And Whew, I've Been Warned\n\nAlso in Goodful: My Husband And I Separated. When We Met Up 14 Years Later, I Was Surprised By What Happened.",

    "fullText": "The first Aston Martin to be designed under the leadership of eminent designer Adrian Newey has appeared in pre-season testing.\n\nThe car's debut had been delayed - although the team have not explained why - but Aston Martin managed to get the AMR26 out for the final hour of running at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on Thursday.\n\nLance Stroll managed only four slow laps before stopping on track, with Aston Martin saying the move was \"precautionary\".\n\nHowever, the car's design has already caught attention.\n\nRunning in an all-black camouflage livery, its nose, side pods and engine cover were clearly different from those that had appeared on most cars so far.\n\nThe test is being held in private and no independent media are permitted.\n\nBut from the few photographs Aston Martin have published, the nose appears wider than the norm on cars designed to the new 2026 rules - with a shape perhaps reminiscent of a duck's bill.\n\nThe side pods are very thin and heavily undercut, the front suspension mounting points are very high on the chassis and the engine cover is heavily cut away.\n\nThe car only arrived in Spain on Wednesday and the team spent most of the day preparing it.\n\nStroll said: \"It was a long day for all the mechanics and everyone in the team pushing flat out to get the car ready.\n\n\"We got a few laps in at the end of the day and it was feeling good. We have to learn the car and understand its strengths and weaknesses.\"\n\nLead driver Fernando Alonso is due in the car on Friday - the fifth and final day of this week's testing.\n\nNewey's cars have won 14 drivers' championships and 12 constructors' titles since 1991 across the Williams, McLaren and Red Bull teams.\n\nHe joined Aston Martin in March last year and has been working on the new 2026 car ever since.\n\nF1 has changed its regulations this year and the chassis, engines, tyres and fuels are all new.

    "title": "Why Holland could be key to Man Utd's revival under Carrick",
    "description": "Why former England and Chelsea coach Steve Holland could be the key appointment in new boss Michael Carrick's coaching team at Manchester United.",
    "fullText": "Ask people who know Steve Holland well how they would describe the former Chelsea and England coach and the same phrase is repeated.\n\n\"Football is his life,\" a source told BBC Sport. \"Whether it's Champions League, thoughts on players or something else, he has a hell of a brain when it comes to football detail.\"\n\nIt explains why, instead of sitting back and reflecting on the success of Manchester United's 3-2 win at Arsenal, Holland spent the return journey to North West England going through footage of the victory with head coach Michael Carrick and the rest of his backroom team to come up with a plan for Sunday's home game against Fulham.\n\nOn Monday, while the players were given a day off, Holland and company were at United's Carrington training ground, honing the sessions they hope will lead to a third straight Premier League win.\n\nAttention to detail is a Holland character trait, something he has relied on since joining Crewe in 1992, after concluding he would advance further as a coach than he did as a player if he dedicated himself to the profession at a young age.\n\nHolland, 55, believes only former England boss Graham Taylor was younger than him when he gained what is now known as the Uefa A Licence coaching badge, when he was 21.\n\nOf the rest of United's new coaching set-up, boss Carrick had not even started secondary school when Holland began his coaching journey. Jonathan Woodgate is slightly older than Carrick. Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion are younger.\n\nIt is why Holland's presence - and, through his England experience, ability to deal with intense pressure - is so vital to Carrick and his coaching team and why he is getting so much credit for the positive start to a tenure that has already delivered victories against Manchester City and Arsenal and taken United up to fourth in the Premier League.\n\n\"He won't be bothered about the scrutiny and pressure at Manchester United,\" says former Radio Stoke editor Graham McGarry, who got to know Holland well during his 16-year stint with Crewe.\n\n\"He will take it all in his stride and just do his job.\n\n\"His training sessions are fantastic. You can already see the Manchester United players are responding to them.\"\n\nNot that Holland is likely to be talking about it in public.\n\nA second trait that keeps being noted is that he is a man of few words, someone who is difficult to read. \"You never knew whether he was quietly content or silently raging,\" said a source who has worked with him.\n\nBut that mask can help when it comes to delivering messaging. The less someone speaks, the argument goes, the more likely their audience is to listen when something is being said.\n\nIt is far too early to assess Holland's work. It is just over two weeks since the coaching team were introduced to United's players as a group for the first time, but several well-placed sources stress the coaching team work as a collective.\n\nIt should not be dismissed either that while Darren Fletcher didn't win his two games in interim charge, he reset the formation following Ruben Amorim's dismissal on 5 January. The Scot began to lift the mood. He also recalled Kobbie Mainoo. It meant key players Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo returned from the Africa Cup of Nations to a stable environment, which gave Carrick the best chance of success.\n\nChanges to the training programme have been made, according to sources. The days are now shorter, but more intense. There is a different energy about sessions and more focus on individual work with specific players. The matchday routine for home games has been tweaked so players now arrive at Old Trafford slightly closer to kick-off.\n\nCarrick was given the job ahead of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, in part, because of the work he does 'on the grass'. But Holland ran the sessions with England, allowing Gareth Southgate to take an overview.\n\nIn consultation with Southgate, Holland concluded England's formation had been 'too stodgy' in qualification for the 2018 World Cup, triggering the switch to a back three. \"Harry Maguire's ability on the was ball fundamental,\" explained Holland in a half-hour dissection of his work for the Coaches Voice podcast in 2021.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports before the Manchester City game, Maguire recalled his own dealings with Holland.\n\n\"He was magnificent for England,\" he said. \"We all knew what we were doing.\n\n\"I can remember a lot of time working with Steve and he really does drill in tactically how to defend and how to keep the ball out of the back of the net.\n\n\"It's basics but really disciplined basics. I feel he will have a big part to play in making our defensive record a lot better.\"\n\nSince leaving his role with England following Euro 2022, Holland has had a short, unsuccessful spell in Japan and undertook some work for the League Managers' Association.\n\nWhat he has not done is court media attention.\n\nThe Coaches Voice chats and others with the Football Association are rare examples of Holland being interviewed.\n\n\"The perfect number two,\" as he has been described.\n\nThe insight that does exist is revealing.\n\n\"With any session the more the players are enjoying their work the more you will get out of them,\" he explained in an interview published by the FA.\n\n\"It is important to try to find creative ways of delivering repetitive practice to stimulate the players' interest.\n\n\"The key always with practice is the transfer into the game. It is important to try and maximise the possibility of a transfer by not steering too far from the reality of the game.\"\n\nHe may be new to Manchester United but navigating the fall-out from a departing boss is something Holland has plenty of experience of.\n\nIt was then Blues manager Andre Villas-Boas who elevated him from the youth ranks to the senior team at Chelsea. \"I was on holiday in Spain,\" recalled Holland. \"I took the call on day two and returned home on day three. My wife still reminds me of that regularly.\"\n\nVillas-Boas was sacked after nine months back in 2012. His successor, Roberto di Matteo, won the Champions League but was dumped after eight.\n\nBehind the scenes, Holland was impressing. He survived the tenures of Rafael Benitez, Jose Mourinho and Guus Hiddink before quitting to concentrate solely on England after Chelsea won the Premier League in Antonio Conte's first season in charge.\n\n\"At a big club, every day is a drama,\" Holland told the Coaches Voice. \"It is never quite as bad as it is made out to be but your ability to handle these moments are decisive.\n\n\"My experience of life at Chelsea has taught me it is about winning. That winning mentality doesn't include feeling sorry for yourself or making excuses. It means you analyse and push to do better next time.\"\n\nThey seem like wise words given the intensity of the noise that surrounds Manchester United, who will look to add more weight to claims their revival under Carrick and co is more than a flash in the pan when they host Fulham in the Premier League on Sunday.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, it seems Holland is already having a significant positive impact at English football's fallen giants.\n\nThe job might be tough, and the demands might be high, but it is fair to assume the Stockport-born 'football obsessive' is in his element.",

    "fullText": "An octopus species native to the U.K. had a major resurgence in 2025. According to The Guardian, its record numbers excited experts.\n\nThe common or Mediterranean octopus is prospering again in the waters off England's south coast from Cornwall to Devon. Matt Slater, a marine conservation officer at Cornwall Wildlife Trust, told The Guardian the local fishermen's catch was 13 times more than expected in Cornwall. It totaled approximately 233,000 octopuses.\n\nThe numbers were so impressive, the Wildlife Trusts dubbed 2025 \"the year of the octopus.\"\n\nThe species is native to the U.K. but is typically seen in smaller numbers. A milder winter combined with a warm breeding season in the spring created conditions that were ideal for the population boom. The last time that amount of octopuses was present in the region was in 1950.\n\nExperts expect an equally large number of the species for 2026 but predict it will drop off afterwards, following previous patterns.\n\nSlater told the outlet, \"It is unlikely, based on past events, that it will go on for a long time. But the sea keeps giving us surprises at the moment so it's quite an unpredictable situation.\"\n\nOctopuses are a valuable part of the marine ecosystem, consuming crabs, crayfish, and mollusks, helping to keep those populations in check. The common octopus is also noted as one of the most intelligent invertebrates in the ocean. It's able to thwart attacks in unique ways and camouflage itself almost perfectly, per National Geographic.\n\nThere is some concern from experts that the octopus \"bloom\" could impact other kinds of fishing. The U.K.'s Marine Management Organisation has said that crab catching numbers are down. But lobster, crawfish, and scallops have all remained stable.\n\nOctopuses have been popping up unexpectedly in other locations as well. The remains of an octopus washed up on the shores of Aberdeenshire, Scotland, and were taken by scientists for additional study. And a filmmaker diving in the waters around British Columbia received a \"gentle hug\" from an octopus while filming underwater.\n\nShould we be harnessing the ocean to power our homes?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

By 2034, he says, Social Security’s reserves are expected to run out of money if nothing changes. “Depending on ... Dave Ramsey Warns That A Third of Americans Will Learn The Hard Way About Social Security",
    "fullText": "Social Security reserves are expected to deplete by 2034 without policy changes.\n\nSaving 15% of an $80,000 salary builds over $1.5M by 65.\n\nMaximizing employer 401(k) matches captures free money for retirement.\n\nInvestors rethink 'hands off' investing and decide to start making real money\n\nA third of Americans will learn the hard way about Social Security.\n\nThat’s according to finance guru, Dave Ramsey, who warns that Social Security alone is insufficient, and instead recommends maxing out 401(k) and IRA savings.\n\nBottom line – we can’t count on the government to take care of us in retirement. And to be honest, you don’t want to put your retirement hopes and dreams in the hands of the government. Look, if you get benefits when you retire, that’s great. But if your goal is to make Social Security your key source of income, you really are setting yourself up for disaster.\n\nAt the moment, more than four million Americans are turning 65 between now and 2027. “That’s over 11,000 people hitting this milestone every single day. The program's cash surplus is expected to run out in less than a decade,” according to NPR.\n\nThat also means that when more people go to retire, they’ll be met with limited resources from Social Security. With that being the case, many of us need to figure out how to make the most of our finances to have a safe, healthy retirement.\n\nMax out your contributions to retirement accounts if you can.\n\nAccounts with tax advantages – 401(k)s, IRAs, health savings accounts, etc. – are great ways to save and invest for the future. In many cases, contributions to these accounts can help cut your taxable income for the 2025 tax season. You have until April 15, 2026, to contribute the maximum amount for it to apply to your 2025 taxes.\n\nAlso, if your employer offers a match program, contribute enough to receive the highest employer match possible. You can also max out your health savings account if you have one. Let's say your employer will match up to 6% of your salary; maximize that.\n\nConsider this. Let’s say you earn $100,000 a year and that your employer will match 50% of your contributions up to 5% of your salary or $5,000. With your contribution and the employer match, $7,500 is saved every year. Over 30 to 40 years of that, you’ll have a solid balance.",

    "fullText": "Gold (GC=F) hovered near $5,400 after falling from a high north of $5,600 per ounce on Thursday while silver (SI=F) steadied after a choppy session as the precious-metals rally paused.\n\nThe volatility came alongside a wider sell-off in the stock market on Thursday with tech declining following Microsoft's (MSFT) quarterly results. The rapid rally in precious metals faced resistance as the US dollar (DX-Y.NYB) rebounded from its lowest level since early 2022.\n\nHow is US dollar strength affecting precious metals?\n\nWhat caused gold and silver prices to pull back?\n\nWhy are precious metals experiencing increased volatility?\n\nWhat are analysts' current gold price targets?\n\n“The continued surge across metals, especially gold and silver, is entering a dangerous phase, in my opinion,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said on Thursday.\n\n“The problem is volatility feeding on itself. As price swings intensify, liquidity thins,” he added.\n\nGold prices had risen roughly 20% year to date as the greenback weakened against other currencies.\n\nJust last week, Goldman Sachs analysts set a year-end price target of $5,400 for gold, with a potential upside risk due to increased participation from private-sector investors.\n\nThe precious metal rallied past $5,500 on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve held rates steady, with commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell doing little to stop the dollar's slide.\n\n“I see this as a sign that conviction levels in the Dollar-down trade are high,” Robin Brooks, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote in a note on Thursday before gold's descent. He noted that \"the weak Dollar is super-charging the debasement trade.”\n\nSilver topped $120 per ounce before paring gains on Thursday. The precious metal is up roughly 50% year to date, following a stunning rally in 2025.\n\n\"Silver prices have already significantly overshot our forecasted averages, though calling a top is close to impossible in markets displaying near-parabolic price momentum,\" JPMorgan analysts noted earlier this month.\n\nInes Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.
