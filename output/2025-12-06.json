    "description": "The Game Awards are coming up soon, and now host and organizer Geoff Keighley is hyping the event with some kind of real-world teaser campaign for something people believe is connected to Diablo. Others do not believe it is connected to Diablo. Some think it's for the next God of War game. Still others think it could be for The Elder Scrolls 6. All of these suggestions may be wrong, however.",

    "description": "Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is intended as both a continuation and a new start for the long dormant franchise. Though Nintendo has never quite said it overtly, it has seemed likely that this is meant to launch a new series of Prime games--possibly even a second trilogy, for the sake of dramatic rhyme. And the ending of Prime 4 accents that feeling, leaving the door wide open for more story--but in the process, diminishing the character of protagonist Samus Aran.\nSpoilers for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond follow.\nAs many eager Metroid fans know from preview coverage and reviews, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond features a wide cast of Federation characters, who have been stranded on Viewros with Samus.",

While other new Reload maps added in 2025 were not directly based on any islands from the main Fortnite Battle Royale, Surf City is largely a shrunken-down version of the new Chapter 7 island, which is based on the southwestern USA--specifically, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas, and everything in between.",
