Likewise, Epic has added a few new types of items that have no real precedent in Fortnite, and some of them are exceptionally powerful.\nBut for this story, the biggest new addition is the boss kits, which drop when you defeat an NPC boss. These kits are locked in your inventory until you win the round or die, make you look like the boss the kit came from, and give you increased health and stamina, and an ability unique to that boss that you have to activate manually by using the item. Oh, and it shows everyone on the map exactly where you are.",

    "description": "A new season of Fortnite means a whole new slate of quests to help you grind your way through the battle pass--and you're gonna need it, because progression through the Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 battle pass is much slower than it was last season. With these quests to give you a boost, and with this guide to help you get through those quests as quickly as possible, you'll have that Dark Voyager skin at the end of the pass in no time. Relatively speaking.\nThere's a major complicating factor that will make it a little more difficult to complete some quests right now at the start of the season. The new method of arriving at the island by surfing in from the ocean means you don't really get much choice in where you land.",
