    "description": "As the QB and face of the team, Herbert will draw the ire of many talking heads who pin everything on him. The truth is this is a failing that encompasses just about everyone involved and will require a real look in the mirror this offseason.",
    "fullText": "Another year, another playoff disappointment for a franchise that seems to have an abundance of them. The Los Angeles Chargers’ season came to an ugly end in the wild-card round, losing 16-3 in a meager performance against a New England Patriots team that wasn’t playing their best football either.\n\nEvery problem that hampered the Chargers this season came to full display alongside a mediocre performance from star quarterback Justin Herbert as they limped their way to another dispiriting end in the playoffs. As the quarterback and face of the team, Herbert will draw the ire of many talking heads who pin everything on him. The truth is this is a failing that encompasses just about everyone involved and will require a real look in the mirror this offseason.\n\n[Get more Chargers news: L.A. team feed]\n\nOne area the Chargers have been consistently plagued by is injuries. For the second straight season, their offensive line was crushed by injuries. All-Pro talent Rashawn Slater was lost for the season in early August, Joe Alt battled through injuries before having season-ending ankle surgery in early November and backup Trey Pipkins III missed a couple games while playing injured in several others. That’s not a survivable situation in the modern NFL with how talented and athletic the front seven players can be, but it’s a disappointing end to the season nonetheless. First-round running back Omarion Hampton also missed games throughout the season and never quite recovered when he came back and free-agent Najee Harris was put on season-ending injury reserve early in the season.\n\nIt seems to happen to this team as much or more than any other, but the unpredictable swings of health really put a ceiling on what the Chargers could accomplish. That doesn’t absolve the play of Herbert or any of the skill players, but they were playing with guys out of position and pulling so deep on the depth chart that it was preseason-quality offensive line play from time to time.\n\nL.A. entered the playoffs playing on a razor-thin margin of error that isn’t feasible to convert into wins at this point. The Chargers also didn’t get any offensive answers from Jim Harbaugh and offensive coordinator Greg Roman to alleviate some of these issues. There’s only so much window dressing that can be done during late-game comeback scenarios, but Roman once again has struggled to put together a cohesive passing game, and even rookie sensation Ladd McConkey had a serious dip in production in Year 2 with the Chargers.\n\nBeyond getting their players healthy and adding talent via the draft and free agency, the Chargers have to tinker with their plan of what this offense is going to look like if they want to have any sustained postseason success. Right now, they could use an overhaul of the passing game while they continue to develop their collection of young receivers. Even though Herbert hasn’t played his best games in the playoffs (0-3 career record), he still has the talent to go on a deep run and three playoff games is just three games. The entire sample size of his career says this is still one of the best quarterbacks in the league and there’s no reason to worry that he can’t do this. There’s still a long way to go on the 27-year-old’s career and given the Chargers’ overall competency they’ll be competing for the playoffs for years to come.\n\nThe good thing is they absolutely have a great thing going on defense, granted coordinator Jesse Minter doesn’t take a head coaching job this offseason. Minter’s defense held up its end of the bargain and the Chargers have done a great job developing some of the young talent on that side over the past two seasons. It’s on the offense and its über-talented quarterback and historically successful head coach to right the ship so they can maximize this current window.\n\nGames like Sunday make it seem like they’re further away than they really are, but they still need a few uncertain and unknown pieces to come to fruition in a big way before they’ll be ready to make that run people have been waiting for.\n\nSometimes it ain’t your year. Sometimes it ain’t anybody’s year. That’s how last night felt for the Chargers and now they’re off to what should be a busy offseason with their league-leading projected $109 million in salary-cap space.",

    "fullText": "The Phoenix Suns are one of the NBA’s biggest surprises of the season and it’s due mostly in part to first-year head coach Jordan Ott.\n\nThe end of the Kevin Durant-Bradley Beal era led many to believe Phoenix was entering a rebuild and that the newly-formed team built around Devin Booker and led by a longtime assistant coach would be a Western Conference bottom feeder.\n\nFast-forward nearly halfway through the season and the Suns are 24-15 and vying for a guaranteed spot in the playoffs.\n\nA revelation like this deserves some praise, and Booker and Phoenix forward Royce O’Neale made their case for Ott to contend for the NBA’s Coach of the Year award following Sunday’s win over the Washington Wizards.\n\nMORE: Dillon Brooks reacts to Suns owner shooting down idea of trading him\n\n“He’s a guru. He studies the game at a high level,” Booker said. “I’ve spoken on it before, he’s not just watching our games, he’s watching everybody across the league and what’s working and what’s not.\n\n“The evolution of it. He doesn’t feel like he has all the right answers. He understands that the game’s changing and evolving at the same time and you have to keep up.”\n\nBooker added that he noticed Ott’s meticulousness during the hiring process.\n\n“He just has a way with connecting with the players, putting us in positions to succeed,” O’Neale added. “He’s also willing to listen. See what we see out there while he’s coaching.”\n\nOtt has made a considerable impression on his roster, fanbase and the NBA at large.

    "fullText": "This story was originally published on MyNorthwest.com\n\nTickets to Saturday’s Seahawks Divisional Round playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers at Lumen Field are a hot commodity.\n\nEven if you can find one, you might balk at the price.\n\nFor example, KIRO Newsradio found a pair of endzone tickets for $4,533.\n\nBut, if you’re feeling lucky, you could win one of nine pairs of playoff tickets and event parking, courtesy of the Washington State Lottery, which is holding a raffle.\n\n“We have been partners with the Seahawks since 2009,” Lottery Director Brian Bennett said, so they decided to get into a little playoff fun by holding a raffle.\n\nHere’s how it works: You must purchase a $10-dollar “Triple Jackpot” scratch ticket from a lottery worker in the Tacoma Mall courtyard, outside Macy’s, on Tuesday, Jan. 13, between 4 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.\n\n“Tickets can only be purchased with cash,” he said, “but you can buy as many entries as you’d like,” for a chance to win.\n\nWhile you wait to see who wins, Bennett said you can meet a former Seahawks star and a favorite Tacoma son.\n\n“We’re going to have Marcus Truffaut there at five o’clock signing autographs,” Bennett added.\n\nAt 6:45 p.m., a live drawing will be held to select the ticket winners. He said you don’t have to stick around for the drawing, but you do need to be available by phone, by 9 p.m., to win.\n\nBennett said it’s unclear just how many fans will turn out to enter the drawing and what your odds of winning will ultimately be.\n\nBut even if you enter just once, there is a chance you could walk away with two playoff tickets and parking. For $10. Not bad compared to the $4,500 endzone tickets (which were likely sold by the time you finished reading this).\n\nRead more of Heather Bosch’s stories here.",

    "fullText": "Former NBA All-Star does not believe in Bam Adebayo's viability as a star player originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Miami Heat have had a rocky season so far, possessing a 20-19 record. It has been a stellar year for players like Norman Powell and Jaime Jaquez Jr. This is a decent run for those players, but the expectations are higher for the longtime stars, which include Bam Adebayo.\n\nAs the longest-tenured player on the Heat roster, Adebayo has become a building block for the franchise. He is a tremendous defender, but he is not as good on the offensive side of the game.\n\nConsidering that he is known as one of the Heat's star players, Adebayo has been underwhelming. He is averaging 16.4 points per game, which is his lowest average since the 2019-20 season when he averaged 15.9 points a night.\n\nHe is also quite inefficient, shooting 44.6% from the field and 31.7% from beyond the arc. It has not been the prettiest of seasons for Adebayo, which has translated into some bad results for the Heat.\n\nMore: Bam Adebayo speaks on the Heat’s starting lineup struggles\n\nThis was quite evident against the Oklahoma City Thunder, as they lost 124-112. In that game, Adebayo was quite anonymous on the offensive end, scoring only six points.\n\nThat is not what is expected from a star player, and former All-Star guard Jeff Teague believes it disqualifies Adebayo from being called a star.\n\n\"Bam don’t really be killing. He’s just a good player. He’s not a star. He’s a good complimentary piece. He’s still a quality player, fringe All Star. I think if they get Ja Morant some new blood in there that can run P&Rs with him I think he’ll step up. I just don’t think he’s playing with a pure PG right now,\" Teague said on Club 520.\n\nMoving forward, the Heat might need other players who can be the true stars of the team. Tyler Herro can play that role, but he has not been fully healthy this season. Kel'el Ware might have that potential in the long run, but the Heat are stuck in limbo at the moment with their current construction.\n\nRick Carlisle announces his support for Norman Powell's All-Star campaign\n\nOKC's champion coach commends the Heat for being 'a great team to test yourself against'\n\nSpoelstra is not concerned about Tyler Herro's spot in the starting lineup amid issues\n\nTyler Herro gets honest about the 'young and fun' Miami Heat this season\n\nErik Spoelstra expresses disappointment in the Miami Heat's lack of effort",

Negotiations are ongoing with Tennessee preparing one final push offer for Leavitt and his representatives.\n\nThis adds an interesting wrinkle to the situation as Kiffin is in desperate need of securing a quarterback.

(Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\n“I honestly wouldn’t discuss the penalty incident, as we already had a rather complicated week in that sense, so it’s best to just look beyond that and focus on the great performance of this team,” noted Stellini.\n\n“The reaction after the penalty gives us great confidence and strength. We had a team that proved once again in a difficult arena and against a strong opponent that it deserved to win the title last season.”\n\nDid Conte say anything to Stellini before the decision not to come to the media interviews?\n\n“There is great satisfaction for the reaction of the team, straight after the penalty we didn’t see the incident, it was just a reaction to conceding rather than to the challenge itself. We don’t want to rewind and look at that again.\n\n“After a red card in previous matches, he has decided not to come here. Hopefully he won’t get sent off in future, then it won’t happen again and everyone will be happy.”\n\nNapoli President Aurelio De Laurentiis took to social media after the game with this message.\n\n“Wonderful match! Fabulous Napoli. With the 9 players who have been absent for much of the season, what would Napoli have achieved by now?”\n\nMILAN, ITALY – JANUARY 11: Antonio Conte, Head Coach of SSC Napoli, looks on prior to the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and SSC Napoli at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on January 11, 2026 in Milan, Italy.

I think we deserved the draw, had a very strong start to the second half, were convinced that we could do damage.\n\n“We’re satisfied with the character, determination and the quality that we showed this evening.”\n\nMILAN, ITALY – JANUARY 11: Antonio Conte, Head Coach of SSC Napoli is taken down the tunnel after being shown a red card during the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and SSC Napoli at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on January 11, 2026 in Milan, Italy.

Despite that, he put in so much effort and humility, he works every day to improve, and we’d love to make him into a complete striker. He has a long way to go, but is already doing very well.”\n\nAs Milan were held to a 1-1 draw by Fiorentina today, which was also their second consecutive stalemate, it means the top spots remain intact.\n\nInter are the leaders on 43 points, followed by Milan on 40 and Napoli 39, all with a game in hand to be played on Wednesday and Thursday, rescheduled for the Supercoppa Italiana commitments.\n\nThe Partenopei were caught in third by Roma, but who have already played 20 rounds, and Juventus are in action against Cremonese tomorrow evening.",

She was back in action this week during the divisional round, as Kimberly was seen cheering on the Texans QB from the stands.\n\nESPN cameras capture @CJ7STROUD mother pulling for her son. pic.twitter.com/YVPJuE7YPJ\n\n— Mark Berman (@MarkBerman_) January 20, 2024\n\nKimberly Stroud BIG John Cena fan https://t.co/klq3rrqVSupic.twitter.com/Ocvo8u4D3C\n\n— Stuart Feiner (@StuartFeiner) January 20, 2024\n\nSN'S PLAYOFFS HQ:Live NFL scores | Full NFL schedule | Updated NFL bracket\n\nThe Sporting News has more details on Stroud's mom and their relationship.\n\nKimberly Stroud is the mother of C.J. Stroud.\n\nThe two have a very tight relationship. Both have been open about the hardships they faced during Stroud's childhood due to the decisions of his father, Coleridge Bernard Stroud III. The quarterback's dad has been arrested twice and is currently incarcerated on a 38-year sentence.\n\nThe arrest of the patriarch put the family \"into financial ruin.\" The four children and Stroud's mother were close to being homeless as a result.\n\n“My mom, she had to play both roles for me for a while — mother and father,\" Stroud said during the NFL Draft. \"I’m super blessed to have a mother like I do.”\n\nWith Stroud's father mostly absent during the quarterback's adolescence, it caused Stroud to mature at a young age — something that helped mold Stroud into the man he is today.\n\n\"He had a choice when his father went away,\" Stroud's mother said. \"He was going to let that motivate him and be the best or he was going to succumb to it and become a statistic of a kid whose parent did something they shouldn’t.\n\n\"I sit and I’m amazed at how resilient he is. C.J. is the most amazing human I have ever met.\"\n\nMORE: Why is C.J. Stroud's dad in prison?\n\nIn November 2023, Kimberly and C.J. launched the C.J. Stroud Foundation, a non-profit organization that helps single mothers, children of incarcerated parents, and criminal justice reform.\n\n\"There’s a lot of different passions that [C.J.] has ... [helping] single moms [is one of them] since I was a single mom,\" Stroud's mother said. \"We all started crying [during the event] because a mom, her husband’s in prison ... same situation.\n\n\"I’m really grateful that C.J. has taken the step … for a young voice in our generation to shed light on some of the issues that go on in this world.\"",

Good luck on your next chapter!”\n\nRaonic won 23 ATP Tour titles during his career; however, he was never able to win one of the major titles.’\n\nAlong with his one Grand Slam final loss, Raonic also lost all four of his Masters 1000 final appearances.\n\nTo be fair to the Canadian star, all of his Masters 1000 final losses came against either Novak Djokovic or Rafael Nadal – two of the greatest players in tennis history.\n\nIvan Ljubicic, the former coach of Roger Federer, has also sent a message to Raonic via Instagram.\n\nHe said: “Congrats on your impressive career! Everyone knows your future will be even more successful. Happy retirement, Milos!”\n\nLjubicic and Raonic worked together for two-and-a-half years before parting ways in November 2015.\n\nAfter they split, Raonic thanked the experienced coach for his help.\n\nAs per Tennis.com, Raonic said: “I’d like to thank Ivan Ljubicic for the tremendous amount of support, knowledge and understanding he has given me.\n\n“The decision has been made that we will not continue our professional relationship in the coming year.”",

    "description": "A day after their playoff loss to the New England Patriots, Chargers players are short on answers to the team's problems after falling short of expectations",
    "fullText": "Ladd McConkey paused for a moment in front of his locker.\n\n“I don’t know,” he said, less than 24 hours after another humbling Chargers playoff loss.\n\n“To be honest with you, it's like, I don't know — but you gotta get that monkey off our back,\" McConkey said.\n\nA tormenting 16-3 defeat to the New England Patriots in the AFC wild-card round sent the Chargers' season to an early finish Sunday for the second consecutive season. Little went right against the Patriots in coach Jim Harbaugh's second year in L.A., prompting questions about what needs to change to make the Chargers a Super Bowl contender.\n\nHarbaugh, general manager Joe Hortiz and the rest of the team's staff will have a full offseason to delve into went awry against the Patriots and a season that fell short of expectations.\n\nAgainst New England, there were offensive line woes and Justin Herbert getting pressured on 30 of 44 drop-backs, which, according to Pro Football Focus, was the second-highest pressure rate of the entire season (behind the Chargers’ Week 14 effort against the Philadelphia Eagles).\n\nHerbert, still searching for his first postseason victory after his third defeat Sunday, showed up in uncharacteristic fashion against the Patriots.\n\nLast season, he tossed a career-worst four interceptions in a playoff loss to Houston. Against New England, Herbert struggled to find open receivers and was sacked six times while the Chargers failed to implement a run game, leading to questions about offensive coordinator Greg Roman’s future with the team.\n\nCenter Bradley Bozeman, often at the heart of public criticism over the Chargers' offensive line, fought back tears when speaking about his struggles on the field. But the eighth-year veteran got choked up the most talking about Herbert.\n\n“It just sucks that we can't get him there,” Bozeman said. “That's what sucks. He's one of my best friends — and it sucks, like it just sucks, because I want it bad for him. I want it bad for myself, I want it bad for everybody, but him especially.”\n\nWhatever the fix, if the Chargers have one, the makeup of the franchise will dramatically shift. Defensive coordinator Jesse Minter is being courted by a host of NFL teams — including the Cleveland Browns, Tennessee Titans and Las Vegas Raiders — for head coaching jobs.\n\nWide receiver Keenan Allen, linebackers Odafe Oweh and Khalil Mack and defensive lineman Teair Tart are among 27 players set to hit free agency. The Chargers also are set to have more than $100 million in salary-cap space to deal with for potential additions.\n\nTart expressed interest in a potential extension with the team. Mack, who also mulled retirement a season ago, is going to think about whether he wants to come back for a 13th NFL season.\n\nThe 34-year-old declined to say whether he'd be back with the Chargers if he decided to play.\n\n“Just trying to stay as present as possible,” Mack said. “Make a decision based on how I’m feeling, how my family’s feeling. ... Just figuring it out day by day.”\n\nOutside linebacker Tuli Tuipulotu, who emerged in his third season in the NFL with 13 sacks, was asked if he felt anything needed to shift to turn playoff heartbreak into victories.\n\nTuipulotu repeated a sentiment that defensive back Tarheeb Still and safety Daiyan Henley repeated earlier Monday:\n\n“I just hope everyone on defense comes back,” Tuipulotu said.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "In the latest twist in the Salesi Moa saga, one of the crown jewels of Utah’s 2026 recruiting class is transferring before ever suiting up for the Utes.\n\nThe four-star athlete, tabbed the No. 1 prospect in the state of Utah and the No. 45 overall player in the nation by 247Sports composite rankings, is hitting the transfer portal ahead of his freshman season, according to a report by 247Sports’ Blair Angulo.\n\nMoa, who changed his commitment from Tennessee to Utah in the early signing period, enrolled at the University of Utah earlier in January prior to entering his name into the transfer portal.\n\nPer CBS Sports’ Chris Hummer, he has a “do not contact” designation in the transfer portal, which “typically signifies a player knows where he’ll transfer to upon entry.”\n\nMichigan, a school that Moa took a visit to during his high school recruitment, is considered the favorite to land the talented prospect.\n\nThe Fremont High star had 63 receptions for 1,272 yards and 16 touchdowns in his senior, according to the Deseret News prep stats database. Moa also had 57 tackles, three interceptions and five pass deflections.\n\nAlong with Kelvin Obot, Moa was considered the crown jewel of Utah’s 2026 recruiting class. Even with Kyle Whittingham leaving to Michigan, no one from that class asked out of their commitment until Moa did on Monday.\n\nFor Utah, the loss of Moa is a big one. The four-star recruit had a chance to crack Utah’s starting lineup at receiver and be an instant-impact player.\n\nThe timing of Moa’s departure — late in the transfer cycle — is a blow for the Utes, who will need to secure another promising wide receiver to replace Moa.\n\nThus far in the transfer portal, Utah has landed one receiver — Utah State’s Braden Pegan, who had 60 receptions, 926 yards and five touchdowns last season.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlthough this season’s NBA trade deadline doesn’t project to be as eventful as years prior, the trade season gives contending teams like the Phoenix Suns the opportunity to refine the margins.\n\nWhat are the margins the Suns need to refine? You may ask. One move could include moving off a piece to get below the luxury tax line a half a season removed from sitting above the second apron.\n\nAs ESPN NBA insider Brian Windhorst suggests, Phoenix may not need to make a roster move because its biggest addition is already rostered.\n\n“I know it sounds corny and I know fans love midseason acquisitions,” Windhorst said in his guest appearance on Gerald Bourguet’s Suns After Dark podcast. “The Suns have been involved in big-time midseason acquisitions before, but their midseason trade acquisition is gonna be Jalen Green.”\n\nMORE: Devin Booker, Suns players make case for Jordan Ott as Coach of the Year\n\nGreen has played in just two games for Phoenix this season, remaining out since early November with a right hamstring strain. In his first and only full game with the Suns, he erupted for 29 points on 6-for-13 on 3-pointers and 4-for-7 on 2-pointers in a 115-102 win against the Los Angeles Clippers. He exited the next game after playing just six minutes.\n\nThe former Houston Rockets guard was the key figure in Phoenix's offseason trade that sent Kevin Durant to the Rockets for Green, Brooks and the draft picks that turned into Khaman Maluach, Rasheer Fleming and Koby Brea.\n\nWhile Green hasn't been able to see the floor, Brooks has risen as a prominent offensive staple in the Suns' otherwise lackluster scoring attack, what with Green, a scoring force in his own right, missing all but two games this season\n\nJaren Jackson Jr. could be traded due to domino effect if Ja Morant is moved, NBA insider reveals\n\nWhy LeBron James will be only player in NBA with special patch on his jersey\n\nCeltics' Jaylen Brown has sarcastic wish granted, gets hefty fine after latest comments\n\nLakers’ JJ Redick removing shootarounds ahead of toughest stretch of season",

    "description": "The Customs and Border Protection officers are joining 2,000 other officers and agents at the Department of Homeland Security who have recently been deployed to the Minneapolis region.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration is sending roughly 1,000 more immigration officers to Minnesota, expanding its law enforcement surge in the state and potentially escalating already tense relations between federal and local officials in Minneapolis.\n\nThe Customs and Border Protection officers are joining 2,000 other officers and agents at the Department of Homeland Security who have been deployed to the Minneapolis-St. Paul region recently, said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said last week that the effort was its “largest operation to date.”\n\nLocal officials in Minneapolis have urged federal forces to leave the city, saying their efforts to arrest immigrants were sowing chaos and danger. Protests have also erupted nationwide after the killing of Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman who was shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis last week. Ms. Good had been participating in a protest in response to immigration agents who had been spotted in the city.\n\nOn Monday, state and city officials in Minnesota and Illinois filed federal lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing that the mass deployment of immigration officers to the Minneapolis and Chicago regions violated the U.S. Constitution. The Minnesota lawsuit asked a judge to block federal officials from “implementing the unprecedented surge” in the state.\n\nTrump administration officials have repeatedly defended their enforcement operations in both states.\n\nKristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said in an interview with Fox News on Sunday that the department was sending more immigration officers to the Minneapolis region, which would allow federal law enforcement there to work safely. Ms. Noem added that people who conducted “violent activities against law enforcement” or impeded operations would be held accountable.\n\n“We’re going to keep doing our jobs,” Ms. Noem said. “Criminal illegal aliens in this country are going to be brought to justice.”\n\nThe increase in immigration officers adds to an already massive federal law enforcement presence in the Minneapolis region. In comparison, the Minneapolis Police Department has roughly 600 officers.\n\nThe Trump administration has intensified its focus on Minnesota in recent weeks, saying it was “unleashing a relentless assault” on the state to root out fraud. Federal officials have also vowed to ramp up enforcement operations in other Democratic-led states including California and New York.\n\nThe administration’s focus on Minnesota follows fraud investigations into a pandemic-era program meant to feed children and other safety net programs in the state. More than 90 people, most of them of Somali origin, have been charged with felonies in recent years. President Trump has used xenophobic language to attack Somalis who are living in the United States, saying, “We don’t want them in our country.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said on Friday that it was reviewing thousands of refugee cases in Minnesota, subjecting immigrants who had already been approved for status to new interviews and background checks. Groups that provide assistance to refugees criticized the effort and said it was an unnecessary attempt to scrutinize immigrants who had already completed a thorough vetting process.\n\nThe Trump administration also said it would suspend funding for food stamps in Minnesota. A similar effort to freeze billions in federal funding for child care and social service programs in five Democratic-led states, including Minnesota, was temporarily blocked by a federal judge in New York last week.",

It also allows us to do more on-the-ground journalism like this. Hit the green button below to learn more.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS, Minn. — The frontline of America’s slow-moving civil war has come to Minnesota. The Department of Homeland Security doubled down on their occupation of the state following last week’s murder of Renee Nicole Good. Now residents armed with whistles, snowballs, and group chats race through the streets, trying to protect one another from the more than 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers swarming the city.\n\nDuring my four days in the Twin Cities, I watched the fabric of American society start to break down. ICE agents armed with assault weapons, tear gas, stun grenades, and pepper spray balls drive cars off the road and break down people’s doors with abandon. The institutions that are meant to protect us — local law enforcement, local politicians, the basic machinery of democracy and accountability — have all but thrown their hands up. “They have bigger guns than we do,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said during an interview over the weekend.\n\nThe digital tools activists have come to rely on have similarly been turned against them. The days of the hashtag and the Facebook Event are over. Instead, anti-ICE organizing is done quietly, via word-of-mouth or (theoretically) untraceable Signal groups. On Saturday, local volunteers pulled over next to my car and asked Panic World producer Grant Irving and I if we were with ICE. We told them we were journalists and they explained they had to ask because our rental car had Florida plates. “A lot of the rental cars around here have been used by ICE,” one of the volunteers told us, before using a walkie talkie to tell other volunteers to stand down and stop monitoring our car.\n\nThe public social networks once relied on to mobilize a community, meanwhile, are full of right-wing propaganda, distorting what’s happening on the ground. ICE has been stalking Minneapolis for months, but the current conflict in the city started in December when far-right Gen Z content creator Nick Shirley published a video titled, “I Investigated Minnesota’s Billion Dollar Fraud Scandal.” Shirley claimed that allegedly fraudulent daycares like Quality Learning Center are supposedly receiving federal funds without having any children enrolled. Shirley’s video has been watched 3.5 million times on YouTube and 139 million times on X. The version on X became a right-wing sensation in the days after Christmas last year. The right-wing hysteria was so loud that no one seemed to notice that the story had been covered extensively by various local and national news organizations over the years and that there’s an FBI investigation currently looking into the allegations. Attention is the only thing that matters. “Who would’ve thought Quality Learing [sic] Center would’ve started all this,” Shirley posted on X over the weekend, sharing a video of a massive anti-ICE protest in Minneapolis.\n\nWith tensions inflamed in the city — and following pressure from Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk, and FBI Director Kash Patel, who all shared Shirley’s video — ICE ramped up their presence. There are more agents in Minnesota than there are local police in both of the state’s major cities. An escalation that directly led to the murder of Good last Wednesday. And now, in response to that, ICE has effectively taken control of the city. Rumors swirl about Trump sending in the National Guard or declaring martial law next.\n\nICE agents are, simply put, fucking clowns. According to The Atlantic, they receive 47 days of training — in honor of Trump, the 47th president, naturally. Many of them, also, can barely read or write, apparently. The ones I spent the weekend following around didn’t even have proper uniforms, with some wearing sneakers. In Minnesota. In January. These dipshits are also wearing camo in the snow. They clearly do not have any training when it comes to their own weapons either. Multiple times over the last few days, I watched officers fire pepper spray balls at the feet of protestors barely a few inches away from them. These weapons are basically paintball guns full of concentrated pepper spray. So when they hit a target, they explode into the air. Which meant ICE agents regularly ended up poisoning themselves with their own weapons. I also watched two agents ask each other if a canister they were about to fire at the crowd was tear gas or a stun grenade. (It ended up being a stun grenade that then ignited the tear gas they had already shot at us, which started a fire in the street that a protestor had to help them put out.)\n\nIn what is assuredly bad news for Bari Weiss’ newest suffer pig, CBS News host Tony Dokoupil, who has spent the last week both-sides-ing the conflict in Minnesota, ICE agents make no effort to hide what “side” they’re on. I’ve seen up close how intertwined the twin engines of the Trump regime are. Brutal state violence and hysterical right-wing internet content work together in lockstep. According to The Washington Post, the agency is under pressure from The White House to create as much content as possible. Which is why ICE agents have a phone in one hand and a gun in the other. But it goes beyond that.\n\nDuring a showdown with protestors at the Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, I watched as one ICE officer fist-bumped a pro-Trump content creator once he learned he was there to support them. I also watched as a gang of groyper livestreamers, led by January 6th insurrectionist Jake Lang, rile up a crowd of protestors, creating the perfect pretext for ICE agents to fire pepper spray balls and tear gas at the crowd. To say nothing of the other right-wing media networks like OAN, NewsNation, and The Daily Wire, that sent video crews to the city, all of them running their own version of Libs Of TikTok. Singling out protestors and ridiculing them on social media. Olivia Reingold, one of Weiss’ Substack squad, spent the weekend on a state-sanctioned ride-along with ICE agents, posting selfies to her Instagram Stories.\n\nBut the most egregious example I saw of how tightly connected these two worlds are happened on Saturday morning. As a convoy of vehicles driven by ICE agents arrived at the federal building, a woman punched the window of one of the cars. Close to two dozen agents jumped out of the convoy and tackled her and her friend to the ground. Immediately following them, coming out of the same car as the agents, was Fox News national correspondent Matt Finn, who filmed the whole altercation with a massive shit-eating grin on his face. When I started filming him and asked who he was with and what he was using that video for, he turned his back towards me and tried to hide his face. “Intense video,” Finn would later caption his post on X.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate how efficient Trump’s shock tactics are and how existentially terrifying they are to oppose. Thanks to National Security Presidential Memorandum 7 (NSPM-7), any form of anti-ICE protest can be labeled as terrorism, including filming them. And Attorney General Pam Bondi has added additional protections for ICE, in a memorandum titled, “Ending Political Violence Against ICE.” You can’t dox agents and you’ll get hit with federal charges if you post anything that’s deemed to be threatening them. ICE also recently purchased two new surveillance systems, Tangles and Webloc, which can track phone activity without a warrant. This morning, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced that DHS plans to launch its own drone program next.\n\nThey are tightening the noose and there is very little room left for any kind of meaningful protest. Minnesotans over the weekend organized massive demonstrations, with thousands of people marching through the south side of Minneapolis several days in a row. But there was no law enforcement there, nor were there any ICE officers (at least in uniform). No one to whom they could direct their anger at. As for local leaders, Rep. Ilhan Omar spoke to the crowd on Saturday, but even she looked shaken. A few hours before the march, ICE agents blocked Omar from inspecting the federal building and even threatened her with pepper spray. Right after Good was killed last week, Noem created a policy that blocks congressional visits without a seven-day notice.\n\nThe protestors I spoke to in Minneapolis were not antifa super soldiers. They were normal people who hoped that the show of support would force the media to cover it and maybe convince people to join their local ICE watch. Their demands were clear: That ICE leave the community and that Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent accused of killing Good, be charged with murder. And as inspiring as it was to see a community come together like that, I can’t help but wonder what a protest can even accomplish when those in power do not think they will ever have to lose that power. It brings us dangerously close to the point where a “fuck Trump” sign at a No King’s Rally amounts to a viral Bluesky post and little else. And it won’t be long until a much darker, far more unpredictable form of opposition replaces that.\n\nThe Trump administration has pushed us to a point where every American now has to make a choice between their own personal safety and the safety of their neighbors.\n\nLike the Minnesota-based TikTok user @stormibabyy27, who uploaded a video of her standoff with ICE agents last week. She ordered DoorDash and ICE agents waited for the deliverywoman to exit her vehicle before pouncing. They’ve been following gig workers around for months. None of the major delivery apps have said anything about protecting their workers, obviously.\n\nThe 15-minute video captures the moment where local law enforcement, over the phone, tell @stormibabyy27 that she has to give the DoorDasher to ICE or risk being charged with harboring a fugitive. She, thankfully, puts enough pressure on the ICE agents to leave, warning them over and over again that she has “11,000 followers on TikTok” and to not come back until they have a court order.\n\nThe lesson here is clear: We’re on our own now. They have guns and drones and they can hack our phones and smear our names online and arrest us without a warrant and charge us with terrorism. And all we have are whistles and protests and TikTok and group chats and maybe some journalism. Our local leaders are admitting they can’t help us. So we’re left with nothing but hope that all of that will be enough. But it’s impossible to shake the profoundly unsettling feeling that we have clearly stepped across the threshold into a very different political reality. And it’s not a matter of if it arrives in your town, but when.\n\nAdditional reporting provided by Grant Irving.\n\nThe following is a paid ad.

    "description": "A malicious Chrome extension steals newly created MEXC API keys, exfiltrates them to Telegram, and enables full account takeover with trading and with...",
    "fullText": "Socket’s Threat Research Team identified a malicious Chrome extension, MEXC API Automator, published to the Chrome Web Store on September 1, 2025, by a threat actor under the alias jorjortan142. Marketed as a convenient way to automate trading on the centralized cryptocurrency exchange MEXC, the extension programmatically creates new MEXC API keys, enables withdrawal permissions, hides that permission in the user interface (UI), and exfiltrates the resulting API key and secret to a hardcoded Telegram bot controlled by the threat actor.\n\nOnce installed, any MEXC account accessed from the infected browser is exposed to full programmatic control by the threat actor, who can:\n\nAt the time of writing, the extension remains live on the Chrome Web Store. We have notified Google and flagged this extension.\n\nMEXC is a large centralized cryptocurrency exchange that offers trading to users in more than 170 countries and territories. That global footprint, combined with an API that supports automated trading and withdrawals, makes MEXC an attractive target for cybercriminals who want to turn stolen API credentials into direct financial gain.\n\nOnline reviews estimate that MEXC serves millions of users. At the same time, the exchange states that it does not provide services to users in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Singapore, parts of China, and several sanctioned countries. Public guides still encourage users in some of these countries to access MEXC via VPNs, especially in the United States, which broadens the potential victim pool and complicates response and recovery.\n\nOn the surface, MEXC API Automator simply automates API key creation for traders. In reality, it introduces a hidden backdoor that gives the threat actor remote control over those accounts by stealing high-value API keys with withdrawal permissions. Rather than harvesting passwords, the extension targets API keys that already allow withdrawals. These keys are:\n\nOnce the threat actor obtains such a key, they can interact with the MEXC API as the victim, execute trades, and initiate withdrawals without needing the user’s password or second factor authentication.\n\nIn the Chrome Web Store description, the threat actor markets MEXC API Automator as a productivity extension that “automates API key creation on MEXC platform”. The listing claims the extension will automatically generate API keys with the necessary permissions, “including access to trading and withdrawals”, directly on the MEXC API management page.\n\nIn practice, as soon as the user navigates to MEXC’s API management page, the extension injects a single content script, script.js, and begins operating inside the already authenticated MEXC session.\n\nThe extension also targets a global audience. Its translations object provides localized UI strings in English, Spanish, French, Russian, and Chinese, which makes the same malicious behavior accessible to a broad victim pool across multiple regions.\n\nThe extension’s content script begins by checking that the current URL contains /user/openapi. If it does, the script waits for the page to finish loading, then immediately invokes its automation logic. There is no confirmation prompt or configuration screen. For the victim, simply opening MEXC’s API key management page is enough to trigger the attack.\n\nMEXC API Automator is a manifest v3 Chrome extension that injects script.js into *://*.mexc.com/user/openapi*, the MEXC API key management page. Once active, the script locates the API key form, programmatically selects every available permission checkbox, creates a new API key, and ensures that withdrawal capability is enabled. At the same time, it manipulates the page’s styles so that the withdrawal permission appears disabled in the UI, even though it is included in the request sent to MEXC.\n\nThe extension does not try to bypass two factor authentication or intercept one-time codes. Instead, it lets the user complete 2FA in the normal way. When MEXC displays the success modal containing the freshly generated Access Key and Secret Key, the script resumes control, extracts both values from the modal, and sends them in a background HTTPS request to a hardcoded Telegram bot and chat controlled by the threat actor.\n\nIn effect, the threat actor uses the Chrome Web Store as the delivery mechanism, the MEXC web UI as the execution environment, and Telegram as the exfiltration channel. The result is a purpose built credential-stealing extension that targets MEXC API keys at the moment they are created and configured with full permissions.\n\nTo make the withdrawal permission look disabled while it stays enabled on the server side, the extension adds special handling for the withdraw checkbox: it strips the visible checked state, injects CSS to hide the tick mark, and monitors the element to reapply this deception if the UI changes. Here and below, the code snippets shows the core logic with our inline comments.\n\nThis logic keeps the withdrawal permission enabled in the submitted form while it appears disabled in the interface. Even if MEXC’s own code reapplies the ant-checkbox-checked class, the mutation observer immediately strips it again.\n\nFor a trader glancing at the form, the configuration looks safe. The key is labeled TradingBotKey, the risk reminder is checked, and the withdrawal box looks unchecked. In reality, the resulting API key has full trading and withdrawal capabilities.\n\nOnce the observer finds the relevant elements, the script extracts the key and secret from the DOM and passes them into a function named sendKeysToTelegram.\n\nThe exfiltration channel is straightforward. The extension issues HTTPS POST requests to the Telegram Bot API and sends the API key and secret as plain text in the request body. It does not touch files on disk, browser storage, or operating system APIs. It operates entirely inside the browser sandbox using DOM access and network calls, which makes the behavior harder for endpoint tools that focus on processes and file system activity to detect.\n\nOnce the bot receives the message, the threat actor can load the key into custom tooling, feed it into automated drainer scripts, or sell it to other cybercriminals. The risk persists as long as the key remains valid and unrevoked, even if the victim later removes the extension.\n\nThe Chrome Web Store lists MEXC API Automator as version 1.0, last updated in September 2025, and attributes it to a developer using the handle jorjortan142 with the contact email jorjortan142@gmail[.]com.\n\nOutside the Chrome Web Store, the same handle appears on X (formerly Twitter) as @jorjortan142 with the display name “sushi.crypto”. That profile describes the user as “CEO Telegram Crypto Wallet SwapSushi” and links to a Telegram bot at t[.]me/swapsushibot, which advertises swapping and earning crypto.\n\nA YouTube channel named “SwapSushi” (@SwapSushiBot) promotes the same bot and brand, again pointing users to t[.]me/swapsushibot. Open source blocklists maintained by anti-scam communities list swapsushi[.]net among crypto-related scam domains, which indicates that at least some SwapSushi-branded infrastructure has already been flagged as suspicious.\n\nTaken together, the shared handle, consistent “SwapSushi” branding, and cross linking between the X account, the Telegram bot, the YouTube channel, and the Chrome Web Store listing support a moderate confidence assessment that MEXC API Automator and the SwapSushi Telegram wallet or swap bot belong to the same threat actor. This cluster focuses on cryptocurrency tooling and, in the case of MEXC API Automator, on clearly malicious behavior that combines covert API key theft with withdrawal permission tampering.\n\nInside script.js, many inline comments are written in Russian. Phrases such as “Основная автоматизация” (“main automation”) and “Мониторинг изменений класса” (“monitoring changes of the class”) read like original developer notes rather than copied boilerplate. Russian language comments are frequent and concentrated around key logic, which strongly suggests that the threat actor behind the malicious Chrome extension is a Russian speaker, while still short of country level attribution.\n\nAny MEXC user who installs MEXC API Automator and allows it to create an API key effectively hands full programmatic control of their account to the threat actor. The extension does not need to guess passwords or bypass authentication. It operates inside an already authenticated browser session, automates key creation with broad permissions, and intercepts the API key and secret at the moment they appear in the success modal.\n\nWe assess that this technique will be reused and expanded. By hijacking a single API workflow inside the browser, threat actors can bypass many traditional controls and go straight for long lived API keys with withdrawal rights. The same playbook can be readily adapted to other exchanges, DeFi dashboards, broker portals, and any web console that issues tokens in session, and future variants are likely to introduce heavier obfuscation, request broader browser permissions, and bundle support for multiple platforms into a single extension.\n\nStart by auditing browser extensions on any system that accesses exchanges, online banking portals, or administrative dashboards. Remove MEXC API Automator and any similar extension that offers to manage API keys or automate trading unless it comes from a trusted vendor and its code has been reviewed. In enterprise environments, prefer centrally managed browser policies and extension allow lists over ad hoc installation by end users.\n\nTreat API keys as secrets, not as long lived configuration values. Store exchange keys in dedicated secret management systems, rotate them regularly, and monitor exchange logs for anomalous activity such as withdrawals from new IP ranges, rapid key creation, or spikes in API usage.\n\nFinally, treat browser extensions as part of your software supply chain inventory. Track which extensions are installed across the fleet, what permissions they request, and which sites they can access. Use Socket’s Chrome extension protection to inventory every extension in use, surface permissions and host access, and block risky updates before they land on endpoints. The same analysis engine that flags supply chain risk in open source packages now scans hundreds of thousands of extensions and alerts on behaviors such as excessive permissions, unexpected page access, and data exfiltration.",

    "fullText": "The new year is upon us, and for many, this is a great time to refresh and update our wardrobes.\n\nSo, we asked stylists to share what we should be wearing and shopping for right now, as well as the garments we should consider keeping tucked away through 2026. First up? Pants.\n\nHere's a look at the pants stylists predict will be in and out throughout the year.\n\nAccording to celebrity stylist Sandra Okerulu, you'll want to have a pair (or two) of metallic pants in your closet this year.\n\nThe statement styles are \"very fashionable, and they allow you to take charge of the room you're in,\" she told BI. Some pairs — especially if they're a looser fit — can even be quite comfortable.\n\nOkerulu recommended styling metallic pants with sneakers and a T-shirt for a more relaxed look or upping the ante a bit for a more formal occasion with a nice blazer and button-down.\n\nIt's not time to toss your favorite pair of joggers to the side just yet.\n\nIn 2026, people are looking to prioritize comfort and style, and these sporty pants can give you the best of both worlds when styled properly — whether with a pair of sneakers or even a heel, depending on the look.\n\n\"There's something about that relaxed jogger look that really has been elevated now for work and everyday wear,\" Okerulu said. \"You can wear them when you're going to work out or when you're going for a job.\"\n\nUltimately, they can be a \"fashionable, fun piece\" to have in your wardrobe, Okerulu told BI.\n\nDianne Boyer, personal stylist and founder of Dianne In Style, said that wide-leg trousers aren't going anywhere in 2026.\n\n\"The overall look for pants will be more streamlined and tailored, and wide-leg pants give a more tailored yet relaxed look,\" Boyer told BI.\n\nPlus, she said, \"They are universally flattering because the clean vertical line elongates the leg and the wider hem balances the hips, creating a long, lean silhouette for every body shape.\"\n\nLeather pants are no longer about adding \"shock value\" to a look, celebrity stylist Anna Lavo said.\n\nInstead, they'll remain popular throughout 2026 because they add instant strength and edge to an outfit while still keeping it polished.\n\n\"This trend reflects a larger shift toward confidence, dressing pieces that feel powerful, versatile, and intentional,\" Lavo told BI. \"Leather pants now move easily from daytime tailoring to evening wear, making them a modern wardrobe essential rather than a statement piece.\"\n\nDenim never really goes out of style. This year, the fitted bootcut is king as people seek out jeans with flattering, well-proportioned silhouettes.\n\n\"It's slim through the thigh with a gentle flare which evens out proportions, highlights the waist, and creates the appearance of longer legs,\" Boyer told BI. \"The bootcut looks even more flattering when paired with a heel or pointed-toe shoe.\"\n\nAccording to Lavo, \"overly tactical cargo pants,\" especially ones with exaggerated pockets and excess straps, are starting to feel dated.\n\n\"In 2026, utility is still present, but it's much more refined and subtle,\" she said. Instead, consider trying cargo pants with minimal pockets or simple sporty joggers, which can be more versatile for styling.\n\nDistressed denim was all the rage throughout parts of the past decade; however, it's now starting to leave the conversation as people are looking for pants that will last.\n\n\"I think that people have realized that if I had a pair of distressed jeans, they can't wear them more than once or twice — three times tops — in a year because it's gonna look repetitive,\" Okerulu said.\n\nThis year, she said, people are looking to buy into trends that are designed to endure at least a few seasons. Think: Properly tailored trousers or sturdy bootcut denim.\n\nAt the end of the day, she said, \"Ripped jeans are just ripped jeans.\"\n\nThough the fitted bootcut is very much in, the extreme flare pants may be on the decline.\n\n\"Similar to super baggy pants, oversized flare pants tend to dominate an outfit rather than complement it,\" Boyer said. \"The widening at the bottom half of the body can throw off proportions, which prevents a more polished, balanced look that is flattering for most.\"\n\nInstead of being a day-to-day staple, flare pants may be more of a special-occasion kind of garment — after all, they can be good for making a statement at a more formal event.",

    "description": "A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.\n\n“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support for Trump — or lack of it — “rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.\n\nThe ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A separate federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.\n\nA spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.\n\nOfficials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”\n\nProjects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.\n\nThe cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.\n\nThe city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.\n\nTrump said in an interview last fall with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.\n\nVickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”\n\nThe administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.\n\nAnne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.\n\n“Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible,” she said.",

    "description": "Kim Kardashian's trainer Senada Greca said five minutes of exercise a day is enough to get started to build strength, burn fat, and boost longevity.",
    "fullText": "When I talk to Senada Greca, she's gearing up to hit the gym with Kim Kardashian: household name, noted entrepreneur — and, apparently, an absolute beast at strength training.\n\nKardashian hits the weights for hours a week, said Greca, her personal trainer, on the phone with me just minutes before her session with the celeb.\n\n\"I love working with Kim. She is an incredibly dedicated woman in all aspects of her life, including strength training,\" she told me.\n\nOn this particular day, Kardashian's workout was going to focus on upper body and core, featuring moves like assisted pull-ups and hollow-body holds. The exercises are paired one after another in a time-saving workout technique called a superset that works the whole body to up the intensity and burn fat.\n\n\"We keep it moving. We don't take too many breaks,\" said Greca, who's been working with her since 2023.\n\nThe sessions are about 90 minutes each, including a warm-up and stretching. They train four to six days a week. Kardashian likes to push herself, and would hit the gym every single day, if not for her trainer urging her to \"take a chill pill\" and rest.\n\nBut you don't have to spend that long in the gym to get major benefits from strength training, according to Greca.\n\nThe trainer said her own personal routine is all about consistency, even if that means working out just five or 10 minutes at a time.\n\nAs a result, Greca is in the best shape of her life at 43.\n\n\"It's about showing up for yourself every single day till it becomes a non-negotiable,\" she said.\n\nShe shared why regular strength training should be a part of your routine for a longer, healthier life, and how to get results starting with just minutes a day.\n\nThe past few years have seen a massive spike of interest in strength training, particularly among women.\n\nThat's for good reasons: lifting weights can boost longevity, improve mood and energy, and sculpt an athletic physique all at once.\n\nGreca, who immigrated to the US as a teen and earned an MBA, said strength training changed her life. She initially pursued a career in finance, but struggled with low self-esteem and an eating disorder. About a decade ago, her doctor helped her reframe exercise as a form of self-care and empowerment.\n\n\"That's when everything kind of changed. I was utilizing workouts to not punish myself, but to nourish myself, to work on my health, my longevity, and my mental state, and everything has been a lot more stable since,\" Greca said.\n\nFrom there, she pivoted to building a fitness empire, attracting more than 6 million Instagram followers with her daily workouts and meal ideas. In recent years, she's launched a strength training app, WeRise, and co-founded supplement company Aonic.\n\nHer passion is helping clients feel strong and capable, making fitness more accessible to everyone from CEOs to stay-at-home moms.\n\n\"I think of strength training as a standard that every woman should embrace,\" she said.\n\nIf you want to start building lean muscle on a busy schedule, a bodyweight circuit is a great option, Greca said.\n\nHer go-to plan takes just five minutes with minimal or no equipment, and hits every major muscle group.\n\nTo try it, perform the following exercises for 45 seconds at a time, resting for 15 seconds between movements:\n\nRepeat for five rounds. If you're feeling motivated or want to increase the challenge, add weights.\n\nRemember, it takes time and consistency to see results. Five minutes alone may not transform your body or health, especially overnight, but it adds up over time as it becomes a habit you can build upon.\n\nGreca said it's important to continue challenging yourself gradually, stay moving outside the gym by walking regularly (especially in nature), and listen to your body.\n\n\"I don't push beyond what my body finds necessary,\" she said. \"I always tell people, listen to the expert within.",

    "fullText": "If you're reading this, you probably have more money on hand than YouTube billionaire MrBeast.\n\nThe world's biggest YouTuber, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, has said he owns more than half of his business, which was valued at $5 billion in its latest funding round. But a hefty net worth doesn't always translate to cash.\n\n\"I have negative money right now,\" Donaldson said in a Wall Street Journal video interview published in early January. \"I'm borrowing money right now — that's how little money I have.\"\n\nDonaldson also said that \"technically, everyone watching this video has more money than me,\" though the self-made billionaire suspected that some people wouldn't believe him.\n\n\"It's funny talking about my personal finances, because no one ever believes anything I say,\" Donaldson said.\n\nMrBeast made a similar point last summer when he said he had to borrow money from his mom for his wedding, adding that he had \"very little money\" since he tries to \"reinvest everything.\"\n\n\"I'm so busy working, I don't really think about my personal bank account,\" Donaldson told the WSJ.\n\nDonaldson's lack of dollars may come as a surprise to fans who have watched him hand out wads of cash to strangers and stand on a pyramid of money. However, MrBeast's company, Beast Industries, is still a startup, and cash flow can be a problem for executives at young companies that aren't publicly traded and have fewer lanes to liquidate their stock.\n\nA lack of cash on hand hasn't stopped Donaldson from splurging occasionally. The YouTuber said he once rented a private jet for about $150,000 to visit his then-girlfriend (now-fiancée), Thea Booysen, in the United Kingdom.\n\nDonaldson is known to drop millions of dollars on YouTube videos, too, which former staffers said he would sometimes kill entirely if they didn't meet his quality standards. The YouTuber said that despite Amazon paying him for his Prime Video show, \"Beast Games,\" he overspent and ended up losing tens of millions of dollars on the first season.\n\nHis company, Beast Industries, has made a push over the last year to reduce unnecessary spending, following a loss of over $100 million in its media division in 2024.\n\nDonaldson has made personal finance a growing portion of his brand.\n\nHe's looking to start Beast Financial, a banking and financial advisory venture. The YouTuber also said he wants to launch a YouTube channel featuring personal finance videos to help educate his viewers on how to handle money.\n\nFinancial content \"just feels like a nice fit for us because we do so much with money,\" Donaldson told creator Jon Youshaei.",

    "title": "This 24-year-old founded a sneaker wholesale company that made $40 million in sales revenue last year — here's how he did it",
    "description": "Oscar Rachmansky, 24, was selling sneakers as a side hustle when he spotted a business opportunity that would become a multimillion-dollar company.",
    "fullText": "Whenever an idea pops into Oscar Rachmansky's head, he whips out a notebook or whatever scrap of paper is closest and writes it down. It's a habit you might expect from a Gen Xer or elder millennial clinging to analog comfort. Rachmansky is neither.\n\nHe's 24, and the company he founded about five years ago generated $40 million in sales revenue in 2025 (confirmed from documents reviewed by Business Insider).\n\nGoing against the grain is kind of Rachmansky's thing.\n\nWhen he was 4, he opened a sunflower seed stand while the other kids sold lemonade. As a teenager, he dropped out of college to pursue a business opportunity that he's since developed into a multimillion-dollar company.\n\nRachmansky launched OS Group in 2019, before he'd turned 20. The company is a B2B wholesaler of branded footwear and streetwear that he bootstrapped from the ground up, he said.\n\nWhat started with sneaker sales out of his bedroom has turned into a team of 30 employees distributing about 25,000 items a month from a large New Jersey warehouse. Rachmansky says he always thought he'd run his own business someday. He just didn't expect it to involve so many sneakers.\n\nGrowing up, Rachmansky was a sports kid who imagined himself running a sports agency one day. \"I certainly wasn't at all interested in fashion, sneakers, or anything of the sort,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nStill, he began buying and selling sneakers in high school as a side hustle. As he learned the resale market, one thing stood out. \"No one was paying attention to the B2B side of this industry,\" he said. \"And that's what powers the entire market.\"\n\nHe launched his B2B company shortly after enrolling at McGill University. His first resale client quickly revealed how fragmented the supply chain was, with retailers jumping through hoops just to source inventory, he said. The inefficiency was obvious. So was the scale.\n\nThen COVID-19 hit. The resale market froze. Rachmansky said he wasn't making any money and briefly considered walking away. \"I was like, well, maybe it wasn't meant to be, maybe I should just keep studying and figure out what happens.\"\n\nCollege, however, never felt like the long-term plan. Within his first month at McGill, he said he opened his notebook and wrote a prediction: \"This is going to be my first and last year of college.\"\n\nRachmansky dropped out of McGill and reinvested the roughly $30,000 he'd earned from his sneaker side hustle into expanding OscarSoles — now OS Group. \"I knew that the industry was growing, and I just wanted to go all in,\" he said.\n\nAt first, the company operated with more hustle than infrastructure.\n\n\"The first warehouse that we had, we didn't even have offices,\" said Isaac Murov, one of OS Group's original employees, who joined the company in 2021. \"We actually made cubicles out of Nike Air Force boxes, so we could have a little bit of privacy,\" he added.\n\nMurov met Rachmansky through a mutual friend, and the two hit it off quickly. \"He was always a very bright individual, and I think I gravitated toward him for that exact reason,\" Murov said.\n\nEven as the resale market cooled after the pandemic, OS Group continued to grow. Rachmansky credits his team above all else. \"We've been really, really intentional with our hiring,\" he said, focusing on people with good attitudes who are coachable and fast.\n\nThat growth came with its own learning curve, though. For the first several years, Rachmansky said, he worked 15-hour days. \"I've always kind of associated output with input — more hours equals better output,\" he said. Eventually, however, he learned that working harder wasn't always the same as working smarter. An early focus on hiring people who added value and growth to the team helped him see that.\n\nThe company's hustle culture was also shaped early on by Rachmansky's willingness to do whatever the job required. \"He always led by example,\" Murov said. \"Whether that was packing boxes in the back, he was never really above that.\"\n\nToday, Rachmansky wants to take OS Group beyond footwear and past pure transaction volume. His goal is to turn the company into a long-term operating partner, offering services like financing, logistics, and software using the infrastructure OS Group has already built internally. \"We really see ourselves as growing into a real operating partner for this industry,\" he said, with the ambition of building \"the entire B2B ecosystem.\"\n\nRachmansky no longer works 15-hour days and says he has a better work-life balance. \"A fear that motivates me is not being able to do everything that I want to do with my life,\" Rachmansky said, adding that he hopes to travel",

    "title": "3 reasons it was a smart leadership move for Powell to release a video",
    "description": "Powell's rare video response allowed him to take control of the narrative — and shows he's willing to make a stand on certain issues.",
    "fullText": "Jerome Powell broke his silence on Sunday — this time on camera.\n\nIn a rare move, the Federal Reserve Chair released a video message after he said the central bank had received grand jury subpoenas that could lead to a criminal indictment.\n\nPowell said the subpoenas related to his June testimony about renovation projects at the Fed's offices, and Trump's administration used the move as pressure to lower interest rates.\n\nFormer Fed chairs and several business leaders have responded critically to the news, and Trump has denied knowledge of the DOJ investigation. For Powell, who rarely reacts to Trump, the public response — and the video format itself — sent a signal.\n\nPowell has typically avoided responding publicly to Trump's attacks, reinforcing the image of the Fed's independence. Opting to make a video statement was a way to project calm, while signaling the stakes of the situation, said communications and leadership experts.\n\nHere are three reasons Powell's video was a power move:\n\nIn the roughly two-minute-long video, Powell emphasized what he said was driving the DOJ probe.\n\n\"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions, or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,\" Powell said.\n\nHis message has already amassed more than 875,000 views on YouTube in under 24 hours. In an age of social media virality, the video format allows him to control the narrative with no intermediary. It also lets him keep up with Trump, who is especially active on social media.\n\nPowell was smart to opt for a video instead of a written statement, in part because news and social media are increasingly visually oriented, Matthew Lombard, chair of the Department of Media Studies and Production at Temple University, said in an email to Business Insider. Journalists and commentators are more likely to use material that comes with images and video, he said.\n\n\"Video, especially when the person directly addresses the camera as he did, is more likely to evoke a sense of presence,\" Lombard said. That makes it more likely the message will land, he said.\n\nIt delivers a \"visceral, 'he's talking to me' perception,\" Lombard said.\n\nChelsea Butkowski, an assistant professor of communication at American University, told Business Insider that Powell's decision to release a short video made it more likely to be shared on platforms like Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok.\n\nPowell's steady eye contact and a consistent tone of voice will likely help capture viewers' attention and also underscore his authority, said Butkowski.\n\nWhile he makes a firm statement, he keeps it short and to the point. Powell's delivery communicates his independence and measured demeanor in a time of chaos.\n\n\"He's really projecting a sense of stability; a sense of strength here,\" she said.\n\nGiven that Powell has built a reputation for not responding to Trump's insults, his selective responsiveness sends a message that this is a significant issue for him.\n\nWhere he filmed the video also matters, says Butkowski. She said that Powell's decision to record the video before a blue curtain with the US flag in the background was likely designed to evoke tradition, while reaching the public in a modern, direct way.\n\n\"He's essentially saying, 'I'm establishment. I've been here through various administrations, and this one is not going to change the way that I communicate,'\" Butkowski said.",

    "fullText": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Monday that the company is launching a new \"top-level\" initiative called Meta Compute, as it pours more money into the data centers and infrastructure powering its AI push.\n\nZuckerberg said Meta plans to build \"tens of gigawatts\" of capacity this decade and \"hundreds of gigawatts or more\" over time.\n\n\"How we engineer, invest, and partner to build this infrastructure will become a strategic advantage,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nThe move signals that Zuckerberg views AI infrastructure as a key competitive advantage and is placing it under a dedicated unit that reports directly to him. Meta has said it plans to invest $600 billion in US infrastructure and jobs, including AI data centers, by 2028.\n\nThe Department of Energy provides a few handy comparisons for the amount of power in one gigawatt: It's roughly half the output of the Hoover Dam, or the power of 2,627 Tesla Model 3s. Famously, the DeLorean, the iconic time machine in \"Back To The Future Part II,\" needed 1.21 gigawatts to travel through time.\n\nSantosh Janardhan, the company's head of infrastructure, and Daniel Gross, who joined Meta last year from AI startup Safe Superintelligence, will lead the new Meta Compute initiative.\n\nThe two executives will work closely with Dina Powell McCormick, Meta's newly appointed president and vice chairperson, who will focus on partnering with governments and sovereign entities to help build and finance infrastructure. Powell McCormick is a former deputy national security advisor to President Donald Trump and spent 16 years at Goldman Sachs.\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A neurosurgeon ended up buying two dogs from Svalinn, a high-end protection dog breeder. He says the pets are worth the price.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dr. Reg Haid. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, my wife, Mary Ellen, and I were without a dog. That was unusual for us: Mary Ellen grew up with German Shepherds. I'd always had sporting dogs — labs and spaniels that could hunt with me. My last dog was a 25-pound Boykin Spaniel who was beautiful, but not very smart.\n\nWe have a property in Montana, so we had heard of Svalinn, a high-end protection dog breeder, and were accustomed to seeing the dogs around. One day, Mary Ellen suggested we go take a look at Svalinn. I told her, \"I'm not getting one of those dogs.\"\n\nAs a doctor, I've stitched up kids with dog bites. In the military, I saw how fearsome dogs can be. I didn't want an aggressive dog. Yet, I went along to the Svalinn ranch because Mary Ellen asked me to.\n\nWhen we got there, one of the dogs came up, kissed me, and put his head in my lap. That's when I started to change my mind.\n\nWe left, but I couldn't get that dog out of my head. I felt he had real intellect, which gave him the ability to connect with me emotionally. I needed him, especially during the lonely days of the pandemic.\n\nMary Ellen and I spent $75,000 on that dog, Elias, who is now 8. The Svalinn team brought him to our cabin for Christmas, and he was loving, gentle, and playful with our children and grandchildren. He immediately became part of the family. I was so smitten that I paid extra — $125,000, at the time — to get the pick of the next litter. Our second Svalinn dog, Rooster, is 4.\n\nI'm embarrassed to say how much I spent on the dogs. I grew up very poor, on a West Virginia farm with no plumbing or heat. I couldn't fathom spending six figures on a dog. However, I've been very fortunate in life to have achieved financial success, first as a neurosurgeon and now as a consultant to a medical device manufacturer. I have the financial means, and the value propositions of these dogs are just amazing. I drive a Ford truck and don't spend money on fancy clothes, but I'm glad I spend it on my dogs.\n\nAs a man, I don't worry much about my safety. The one time I've felt protected by my dogs was during one of our frequent hikes in Montana. They started acting alert. I didn't wait to find out what was going on — I just got out of there.\n\nMary Ellen really appreciates having the dogs as deterrents and protection. I travel for work, and she never worries about being home alone with Elias and Rooster sleeping in our room. I've noticed that if something startles Mary Ellen, the dogs become very attentive and engaged.\n\nWhen Elias was delivered, Mary Ellen and I did two days of work with Svalinn trainers, where we learned how to handle him. I work with them daily to keep them up to date with their commands, and we return to the Svalinn ranch at least once a year to work with their trainers. It's an awesome couple of hours learning together. These dogs don't just require a financial investment; they also require an emotional and time investment.\n\nAs an equestrian, there's a feeling when you're riding a really intelligent horse that's transcendent. That's the closest I can come to describing the value of Svalinn dogs. Quite frankly, there's an emotional connection that I didn't anticipate. I never knew I could love a dog so much.\n\nIf I had read this five years ago, I would have thought, \"This guy's crazy.\" I know how it sounds, but Elias and Rooster are just different. They have all of the benefits of having a dog with none of the inconvenience: no barking or misbehavior. The intellect and emotional intelligence they have are worth every penny.",

    "description": "Trump called for interest on credit cards to be capped for a year. UBS thinks that would end up hurting credit availability for some borrowers.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's idea to cap credit card interest could have far-reaching unintended consequences, UBS said on Monday.\n\nOn Friday, Trump posted on Truth Social that he was calling for a one-year, 10% rate cap for credit card interest, stating that the industry has been taking advantage of consumers.\n\nThe idea sparked a sell-off in major financial stocks on Monday, including Capital One, Synchrony Financial, JPMorgan, and Citigroup.\n\nWhile investors reacted to the latest threat to lenders' bottom line, UBS said that Trump's plan would have a negative impact on Main Street despite its intention to relieve high borrowing costs for many Americans.\n\nUBS analyst Erika Najarian said that the proposed credit card rate cap would likely backfire, as it would likely reduce consumer spending and curtail lending to certain borrower groups.\n\nNajarian said that credit card providers are more likely to dial back the availability of credit to certain borrowers, rather than simply offer cheaper credit.\n\n\"It is pretty clear that a 10% credit card rate cap would cut off credit availability to those that need it most: middle- and lower-income Americans,\" she added.\n\nThe team of analysts at UBS said that while they see a low likelihood of the plan becoming law, the overall impact on credit availability would be felt by both investors and consumers.\n\n\"According to the Boston Fed, the aggregate credit card spend by annual household income was as follows in May '25: 1) <$39k: ~$26bn; 2) $59-83k: ~$37bn; 3) >$121k: $175bn. Based on Boston Fed data, this means 26% of credit card spend, at least, would be at severe risk, implying a major impact on the economy.\"\n\nThe analysts noted that consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP on average. Additionally, credit card spending accounts for nearly half of Visa's payment volume and more than half of Mastercard's. The kind of pullback predicted by UBS could severely compromise US economic growth.\n\nNajarian isn't the only finance pro to suggest that Trump's credit card rate cap plan could backfire. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman described it as a \"mistake\" and claimed that millions of credit cards could be cancelled as a result.",

    "description": "George and Amal Clooney are the ultimate power couple, both in their careers and fashion. Together, they've shown great style for more than 10 years.",
    "fullText": "Few celebrity couples are at the level of George and Amal Clooney.\n\nThe actor and lawyer have been married for over a decade, during which time they've both remained at the top of their fields. They're also extremely stylish. Talk about a power couple.\n\nHere's a look at the best style moments they've had together.\n\nThey attended an event in Florence, Italy, while wearing matching black ensembles.\n\nAmal stunned in a strapless gown with sparkles on the back of her skirt, and George donned a tuxedo with a satin tie.\n\nAmal especially stood out in a red, strapless ball gown custom-made for her by Margiela and John Galliano. It had a paillette-covered bodice and an asymmetrical tiered skirt.\n\nGeorge's look was also special. He wore a black jacket that was cropped in front and longer in the back, as well as a white button-up with a matching bow tie. The actor completed his look with a red pocket square that matched his wife's dress.\n\nGeorge looked relaxed in a white button-up shirt, light jeans, brown boots, and a metallic watch. Amal, however, seemed ready to party.\n\nShe wore a gold minidress covered in sequins, as well as black pointed pumps and stud earrings.\n\nAmal looked stunning in a sleeveless black dress covered in dazzling sequins. The gown's skirt also had a sheer overlay made from tulle that reached the floor.\n\nGeorge, on the other hand, wore a black tuxedo with a matching shirt and tie.\n\nAt the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, George and Amal walked the red carpet in elegant evening wear.\n\nThe British-Lebanese barrister wore a yellow Versace dress with a single strap and thin train, while her actor husband looked dapper in a black tuxedo with a white shirt and black bow tie.\n\nGeorge wore his standard tuxedo and bow tie for the event, keeping all eyes on his wife.\n\nShe walked alongside him in a strapless gown with a white bodice and tiered skirt crafted from white, gray, and black feathers.\n\nOn the red carpet that day, George was photographed smiling in his black tuxedo while seemingly drawing attention to his wife.\n\nAmal, on the other hand, posed for photographs to show off her Richard Quinn ensemble, consisting of a silver top, navy pants, and a floral skirt made from tinfoil.\n\nDesigned by Stella McCartney, Amal's yellow dress had short sleeves, a midi skirt, and a tie that extended behind her. It paired perfectly with her gold heels and matching yellow hat.\n\nGeorge complemented her outfit with his gray suit, white shirt, and pale-yellow tie.\n\nWhile George wore a classic tuxedo and bow tie, Amal donned a strapless white gown with a floor-length cape that covered her arms and shoulders.\n\nAmal's take on the look included a navy jumpsuit with wide-legged pants and an asymmetrical bodice. She also wore a thick black belt, pointed pumps, and a printed clutch.\n\nGeorge took a similar approach and wore a loose-fitting black suit with a half-unbuttoned shirt underneath.\n\nIn October 2021, they attended the premiere of \"The Tender Bar\" together.\n\nAmal wore a black dress with a silver sequined pattern. It was strapless, with a high-low skirt and thin slits at her hips.\n\nGeorge complemented her look in his classic style: a deep-gray suit with a black button-up shirt.\n\nWalking arm in arm, the couple was photographed wearing elegant looks. George donned a black tuxedo, while Amal wore a strapless gown covered in white sequins.\n\nShe completed the latter outfit with white pumps and a feather shawl.\n\nAtelier Versace designed Amal's dress, which was sleeveless with layers of gold beads arranged in an intricate pattern from top to bottom. The gown also had a slit in the middle of its skirt that revealed Amal's silver sandals.\n\nGeorge, on the other hand, wore a classic tuxedo with a bow tie and dress shoes.\n\nAmal's dress, designed by Del Core, stood out on the red carpet. It was crafted from green and tan tulle, with a strapless neckline and a diamond-shaped cutout at her chest.\n\nShe completed the look with a green clutch and diamond earrings, while George kept things simple in his standard tuxedo.\n\nGeorge wore a traditional suit with a rainbow-colored neckpiece on the red carpet.\n\nAmal, on the other hand, chose an off-the-shoulder Valentino gown embellished with crystals. She also wore a diamond bracelet, pointed heels, and deep-red lipstick.\n\nWhile George wore a simple black outfit — a blazer, dress pants, and button-up top — Amal took a lighter approach.\n\nShe wore a peach, sleeveless gown with a lace-lined neckline and tulle skirt, playing into the ballet-inspired fashion trend that was popular in 2023. The vintage dress was designed by Christian Dior.\n\nWhile George donned a classic black tuxedo and bow tie, Amal walked beside him in a muted-yellow Versace gown. The dress was made with netting and lace and featured a train that flowed behind her.\n\nThe couple walked the red carpet ahead of a \"Jay Kelly\" screening — a comedy-drama starring George.\n\nHe wore a black tuxedo with satin lapels and matching stripes down each trouser leg. He also donned a matching bow tie.\n\nAmal, on the other hand, wore a vintage Jean-Louis Scherrer gown in fuchsia. It was strapless and featured a ruched bodice that was lined with buttons. It also had a thick, puffy train that fanned around her as she walked.\n\nAmal wore a vintage Balmain gown in red, which was sleeveless with a sweetheart neckline and a ruched skirt. Its vibrant color stood out against her husband's classic black tuxedo.\n\nBefore walking the 2026 carpet, their last appearance at the Golden Globes was in 2015.\n\nGeorge ditched his bow tie and swapped his tuxedo for a more casual suit after the Golden Globes. He also wore a black undershirt instead of a white one.\n\nAmal, on the other hand, changed into a lime-colored minidress from Versace that was held together with safety pins.",

    "description": "Jerome Powell says the criminal investigation centers on a June Senate hearing, where he got into a heated exchange over the Fed's renovation plans.",
    "fullText": "In an extraordinary video Sunday night, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said he had been served with grand jury subpoenas as part of a criminal investigation into his testimony about the Fed's Washington, DC, headquarters.\n\nWhile much has been made over whether the probe is a pretext for President Donald Trump to remove Powell as Fed chairman, far less attention has been paid to what Powell actually said in the June Senate testimony that sparked the Justice Department investigation.\n\nWhile criminal probes and grand jury hearings are tightly guarded secrets, here is what we know so far:\n\nAt the June hearing, Powell got into a heated exchange with Sen. Tim Scott, the Republican chair of the Senate banking committee, who criticized the Federal Reserve for \"lavish renovations\" of its main offices.\n\nPowell's responses to Scott's questions prompted one of Trump's allies in the House of Representatives to send a criminal referral to the Justice Department, accusing Powell of perjury.\n\nIn one of the statements singled out by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna as potentially perjurious, Powell said one of the Federal Reserve's buildings never had a \"serious\" renovation. Luna said the building was renovated between 1999 and 2003.\n\nLuna also accused Powell of making a false statement during an exchange with Scott when Powell denied the Federal Reserve would implement some of the more opulent-sounding features it had previously planned.\n\nAt the Senate hearing, Scott pressed Powell with questions about a planning document that said the central bank's historic Marriner S. Eccles building would install \"rooftop garden terraces\" and \"ornate water features,\" as well as new elevators for board members to take to a \"VIP dining suite.\"\n\nPowell dismissed Scott's comments about the project as \"flatly misleading.\"\n\nThe Eccles building had been using the same elevator since the building was built in the 1930s, he said. Other issues Scott raised were \"no longer in the plans,\" Powell told him.\n\n\"There's no special elevators. There are old elevators that have been there,\" he said. \"There are no new water features. There's no beehives, and there's no roof terrace gardens.\"\n\nPowell testified before the Senate Banking Committee in June, following the Federal Reserve's semiannual report, where he discussed the challenges of using interest rates to combat inflation, which he said could remain high due to Trump's tariff policies.\n\nAside from his criticism of the central bank's slow movement on interest rates, Scott criticized the more than $2 billion plan to renovate the Eccles building and the 1951 Constitution Avenue building. He said the changes to those offices \"feel more like they belong in the Palace of Versailles.\"\n\nPowell told senators that the Eccles building had long been in need of renovation for safety reasons. The renovation began in 2022 and is overseen by members of the Federal Reserve board, who are all confirmed by the Senate. Trump nominated Powell himself in his first term in 2017.\n\n\"When I was the administrative governor, before I became chair, I came to understand how badly the Eccles building really needed a serious renovation,\" he said. \"Never had one. It was not really safe and it was not waterproof.\"\n\nThe following month, Luna said Powell had broken the law by perjuring himself and making false statements to Congress.\n\nShe sent a criminal referral to Attorney General Pam Bondi, asking the Justice Department to open an investigation into the Federal Reserve chairman.\n\nIt isn't clear if Luna's referral formed the basis for the ongoing criminal investigation into Powell. A representative for the US Attorney's Office in Washington, DC, declined to comment.\n\nLuna's letter said Powell's statements at the hearing contradicted a Federal Reserve planning document, which said the central bank's buildings would get new rooftop gardens, outdoor water jets, and a private dining room.\n\nA spokesperson for Luna said her letter relied on the same 2021 document that Scott had asked Powell about in the June hearing.\n\nPowell told the senator the renovation project had already scrapped some luxurious-sounding features and that the plans had \"continued to evolve.\"\n\nThe renovation would be thrifty with building materials, Powell said.\n\n\"There's no new marble,\" he said. \"We took down the old marble, we're putting it back up. We'll have to use new marble where some of the old marble broke.\"\n\nA two-page fact sheet on the Federal Reserve's website about the renovations of the two historic buildings reiterates what Powell said. \"No new VIP dining rooms are being constructed as part of the project,\" \"There is no VIP elevator,\" \"There are no new water features,\" some bullet points read.\n\nLuna also said Powell lied to Congress when he said the Federal Reserve's Eccles building had \"never had\" a \"serious renovation.\"\n\n\"This statement is also false,\" Luna wrote. \"The Federal Reserve Board conducted a comprehensive renovation of the Eccles Building from 1999 to 2003, which included the replacement of the roof, all major systems, and a full refurbishing of interior and courtyard spaces.\"\n\nLuna accused Powell of making another false statement to Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought when he wrote a letter saying changes to the construction plans were intended to \"simplify construction and reduce the likelihood of further delays and cost increases.\"\n\nTrump has denied knowing about the DOJ's probe, but he has not been shy about voicing his dissatisfaction with the Federal Reserve for not lowering interest rates faster.\n\nHe has said he would like to fire Powell, and made the unusual move of announcing plans to select Powell's replacement ahead of the expiration of Powell's 10-year term in 2028. Trump has also attempted to fire Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee on the Federal Reserve board, in a case that will be heard before the Supreme Court next week.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's renovation plans have irked Trump, who complained about the project's cost during a July tour of the construction site with Powell and Scott.\n\nIn his statement Sunday, Powell said the Justice Department subpoena \"should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\n\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings,\" he said, adding, \"Those are pretexts.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with a comment from a Rep. Luna spokesperson.",

    "description": "Cloudflare data shows the top AI labs are strip-mining the web, and it's getting worse not better.",
    "fullText": "Are AI giants nurturing the web, the most valuable store of human data the world will ever see? Or are they scraping content for free and giving little back? Updated data from Cloudflare sheds new light on this important question.\n\nThis is one of the most under-discussed parts of the AI revolution. While tech companies spend lavishly on data centers, GPUs, and talent, they avoid talking about the other key ingredient of AI success: data.\n\nThat's because they don't want to pay for the high-quality human data that's needed for AI model training, inference, and AI outputs. Instead, they send out bots to crawl websites and scoop up this information, mostly for free.\n\nIn the past, tech companies would send users to the original sources of this information. This formed the grand bargain of the web. Sites would let their data be taken for free on the understanding that they would get referrals in return, and could pay for their efforts through advertising, subscriptions, and other techniques.\n\nIn the new generative AI world, this deal is breaking down. Now, AI answer engines and chatbots give users direct answers, making people less likely to visit the websites that created and verified the data in the first place.\n\nCloudflare, which helps run about 20% of the world's websites, began tracking this behavior in 2025. It measures Big Tech company bots' requests to crawl websites, and the number of referrals the platforms send to sites.\n\nThis crawl-to-refer ratio is a useful guide to how much tech companies are taking from the web and how much they're giving back. For example, a ratio of 100 to 1 would mean a company's bots crawled sites 100 times for every 1 referral they send.\n\nIs this one way to measure how ethical companies are in the AI era? I'll leave you to decide. Here's the data for the first week in January.\n\nAs you can see, Anthropic stands out like a sore thumb. According to Cloudflare data, it crawls sites way more than it sends users out to the web. Anthropic actually crawled even \n\nThe same applies to OpenAI; its crawl-to-refer ratio has worsened. Again, this suggests that OpenAI is taking more value from the web and giving less value back.\n\nThis aligns with Business Insider reporting from late 2024. Back then, we told you that bots from Anthropic and OpenAI, especially, were crawling some websites so much that it was causing their traffic costs to spike dramatically.\n\nOne web developer saw a client's cloud-computing costs double within a few months due to this AI bot swarm, according to BI reporting.\n\nSo, not only are AI companies taking from the web and giving less back — they are also leaving some site owners with bigger bills to pay.\n\nLike last quarter, I asked Anthropic why it crawls so much and gives so little back to the web. The startup did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nBack in September, Anthropic said it couldn't confirm the crawl-to-refer ratios calculated by Cloudflare and said there may be \"issues\" with the methodology. At that time, Anthropic also noted that it launched a web search feature for its popular Claude AI chatbot earlier this year.

    "title": "Why the attack on Fed Chair Jerome Powell follows Donald Trump's typical playbook — and isn't going to stop there",
    "description": "The Federal Reserve is supposed to be independent from the president. The Justice Department investigation into Jerome Powell could change that.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump wants Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, to do something Powell doesn't want to do.\n\nNow, Trump's federal prosecutors are now investigating Powell.\n\nThat's the shortest version of the news story that broke Sunday night, when Powell released an extraordinary statement and video, which I urge you to watch and read for yourself.\n\nKey quote from Powell, who Trump picked as Fed chair in 2017: \"This unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\n(Trump told NBC on Sunday that he didn't have any knowledge of the investigation and that the DOJ wasn't trying to pressure Powell into lowering interest rates. If you find that hard to believe, you might point to the fact that the investigation was reportedly authorized by US Attorney Jeanine Pirro, the former Fox News anchor who is a longtime Trump ally.)\n\nAs Powell notes, using the threat of a criminal prosecution — fueled by a pretext — to pressure the Fed, which is meant to be independent of the White House but accountable to Congress, is unprecedented.\n\nBut the pattern most definitely has precedent in the Trump administration: Trump will say he wants or needs something to happen, often using fantastical logic to justify it — and then uses coercion to try to make it happen.\n\nIn this case, it's about Trump wanting the Federal Reserve to lower rates. And more broadly, about Trump wanting the Federal Reserve to answer to him.\n\nThat's why, prior to investigating Powell, he has also tried to remove Fed member Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee the Trump administration has accused of mortgage fraud. Cook fought Trump in court, and later this month the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the case — and eventually rule on whether Trump can remove a Fed governor \"for cause.\"\n\nIt's easy to see many other examples of Trump trying the same thing. Trump, for instance, insisted that political enemies like former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James should be prosecuted for … something. And when a Trump-appointed prosecutor declined to bring charges, Trump had him replaced with another appointee who would. Both of those cases have been dismissed by a federal judge, who said Lindsey Halligan, the Trump-installed US attorney who brought the cases, had been unlawfully appointed. The DOJ is appealing.\n\nOftentimes, the reactions to Trump's pressure campaigns amount to a shrug — Democrats complain, Republicans usually back him (or say nothing), and markets move around a bit before reaching a new equilibrium.\n\nMaybe this time will be different: The Fed is supposed to be an institution that investors care about as a steady, guiding hand that doesn't swing wildly with political winds. Markets can ignore a lot of political ugliness; pressure on the Fed is harder to dismiss.\n\nThe broader pattern Powell is underlining goes well beyond monetary policy or even political score-settling. The administration has repeatedly paired aggressive action with a justification that is often strained at best. Prior to the raid that removed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro this month, Trump and his proxies repeatedly insisted that Maduro and his country were killing countless Americans by bringing fentanyl into the US — which is not true. Last week, Kristi Noem, Trump's head of Homeland Security, said the shooting of a Minneapolis woman protesting an ICE raid was justified in part because she was a \"domestic terrorist.\"\n\nSome of you will look at Trump's behavior and find something in there that you like, in an ends justify means formulation. Maduro was a terrible leader, so maybe you think that making up reasons to depose him doesn't matter much. Maybe you like Trump's deportation agenda, and aren't worried about him using masked agents with guns on city streets to make that happen.\n\nGive it time. We're still just a year into the second Trump administration, and his impulse to act without restraint has yet to find real pushback. \"My own morality. My own mind. It's the only thing that can stop me,\" he told The New York Times last week, when asked about the relevance of international laws and treaties. A president with an infinite target list and unchecked power is never finished.",

    "title": "'Heated Rivalry' proves fresh faces can still blow up Hollywood",
    "description": "\"Heated Rivalry\" has become a word-of-mouth hit for HBO Max. Both stars, Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams, were previously unknown to audiences.",
    "fullText": "When Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams made their Golden Globes debut on Sunday, walking onstage to the tune of Chappell Roan's \"Pink Pony Club,\" they were met with a roar of applause so enthusiastic, you'd think they were Oscar frontrunners from a recent blockbuster.\n\n\"You think everyone in the audience has seen 'Heated Rivalry?'\" Williams asked his costar in a lighthearted bit.\n\n\"That's a maybe,\" Storrie replied with mock stoicism. \"But their trainers have, and their moms have, and their daughters have.\"\n\nIf you didn't know who Storrie and Williams were before they were tapped as presenters at the awards ceremony — and, indeed, if you still don't — there's no need to be ashamed. The two actors were largely unknown before they were cast in the Canadian import \"Heated Rivalry,\" a romance drama that HBO head Casey Bloys recently called \"a word-of-mouth sensation\" after its first season debuted on the streamer in late November. The data bears this out: according to data from Luminate, viewership increased tenfold between the premiere and the finale, and the show has continued to accumulate hundreds of millions of viewing minutes even after the season ended in December.\n\nThe show, based on a book series by Rachel Reid, follows Ilya Rozanov (Storrie) and Shane Hollander (Williams), two professional hockey players who embark upon a secret love affair. The series has quickly attracted a devoted following thanks to its steamy sex scenes and the onscreen chemistry between its co-leads.\n\nI can personally vouch for the show's addictive appeal. Before I compulsively binged all six episodes in a single Saturday evening, declining a friend's invitation to go out because I wanted to keep watching, I'd been asked about the show by no fewer than six people. These questions were usually phrased as assumptions: \"You've seen 'Heated Rivalry,' right?\"\n\nThis success story is anomalous, not least because the show was made with a relatively scant budget (showrunner Jacob Tierney said production was \"insanely cheap\" by American standards) and no major star power to speak of. Unlike many of their peers at the Golden Globes, before being cast as on-ice rivals and off-ice lovers, Storrie and Williams didn't have massive follower counts on Instagram, viral TikTok videos, or fan bases carried over from past projects — and I can confidently say their low profiles were blessings in disguise.\n\nSure, \"Heated Rivalry\" would've received a bigger marketing push had bigger names been on the poster, but it has delighted viewers and drawn attention regardless. The show's popularity is a testament to the appetite for fresh faces in Hollywood.\n\nThese days, it can feel like the same group of celebrated actors is appearing in a never-ending rotation of blockbusters, regardless of how well they suit the role at hand. (A list of names probably just popped into your head as you read that sentence.)\n\nI can't help but think of last year's announcement that Sam Mendes would make four interconnected Beatles biopics. Instead of trying to find promising newcomers who closely resembled and could embody the famous bandmates, the cast reveal reads like a standard response to the trivia question, \"Which young male actors have the most critical buzz and fanfare right now?\"\n\nIt's not that Paul Mescal (\"Hamnet,\" \"Gladiator II\"), Harris Dickinson (\"Babygirl,\" \"The Iron Claw\"), Joseph Quinn (\"Fantastic Four,\" \"Stranger Things\"), and Barry Keoghan (\"Saltburn,\" Sabrina Carpenter's ex-boyfriend) don't have chops — it's that name recognition almost certainly came into play in casting.\n\nThe most obvious actor missing from that list would be Timothée Chalamet, who helmed his own biopic as Bob Dylan in 2024. His latest release, \"Marty Supreme,\" is a top Oscar contender featuring a terrific lead performance — though one that I decisively associate with the actor's fame, reputation, and enthusiastic marketing campaign. Chalamet is someone I'm very familiar with, even fond of, and I was impressed by his work in the film. Still, this familiarity kept me at arm's length from the character, raising the barrier to suspend my disbelief. While watching, it was difficult for me to see the face of ping-pong player Marty Mauser, and not Chalamet wearing light facial prosthetics.\n\nEven now, after watching interviews and promotional videos of Storrie and Williams as themselves, it hasn't colored my experience of the show. (I just finished my second rewatch.) Their characters exist in the pure realm of my brain's pleasure center, untouched by Hollywood's machinations. When I watch Ilya and Shane kiss on my screen, I don't see two actors putting on a performance or vying for nominations; I see two people in love.\n\nI would hope and assume that opportunities for Storrie and Williams are pouring into their agents' inboxes, so they'll soon have the recognition and buzz that will buoy them into being cast in other projects. Fame awaits them as surely as \"Heated Rivalry\" fans await season two. Still, let their unlikely fairytale inspire more casting agents to take a chance on actors without clout.",

About four times a year, he emerges from meetings with Federal Reserve governors and regional bank presidents to hold press conferences on their analysis of jobs data, inflation reports, and subsequent interest rate projections (the infamous \"dot plot\").\n\nNot exactly typical fodder for going viral. But on Monday, after Powell released a video saying he'd been subpoenaed by the Justice Department as part of a pressure campaign, he started getting the meme treatment.\n\n\"I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy,\" Powell said in Sunday's two-minute video. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\nSocial media thought it was a banger.\n\nIn this house, Jerome Powell is a herohttps://t.co/VNfAnNCan3 pic.twitter.com/B6LRbKBD7D\n\nhttps://t.co/gHat9QbklK pic.twitter.com/IPxgoITbyx\n\nA post shared by Archegos Capital (@archegoscapital)\n\nYou know things are bad when the most boring person doing the most boring job for decades has to come out and say, “Stop trying to arrest us for doing math” https://t.co/3YCfPBFIae\n\nJerome Powell walking to the office this morning pic.twitter.com/wYibAekAmy\n\nMarco Rubio finding out he has to be chairman of the Federal Reserve pic.twitter.com/Ajzro16AuS\n\nWE ARE JEROME POWELL! pic.twitter.com/faTyYRcXLa\n\nNo the Resistance is fine, I just didn’t realize it would be lead by Jerome Powell https://t.co/JJvzkmylOo\n\nPresident Donald Trump has called on Powell, whose term doesn't end until May 2026, to lower interest rates more quickly. Powell has refused and insisted on the Fed's independence. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to fire Powell.\n\nThe president denied any involvement in the DOJ investigation in an interview with NBC on Monday. \"I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings,\" Trump said.",

    "description": "Meta's new Checkpoint program restructures worker ratings and incentives, rewarding top performers with up to 300% of their base bonuses.",
    "fullText": "Meta is overhauling how it grades workers and rewarding top performers with up to 300% of their base bonuses, according to internal screenshots of a memo sent to employees on Monday that Business Insider obtained.\n\nThe social media giant is rolling out a new performance program called Checkpoint, which reshapes ratings into four buckets, according to the memo. It will start in \"mid-year 2026,\" aiming to make performance reviews less bureaucratic and more focused on outcomes.\n\n\"The new scale reflects what we know to be true: most people at Meta are high performers who consistently deliver meaningful impact,\" the memo said.\n\nIn particular, Meta said its new system will incentivize the strongest performers with higher bonuses.\n\nHere's how the memo outlines the new distribution and pay multipliers for base bonuses.\n\nAdditionally, Meta says it's introducing a new Meta Award, a 300% individual multiplier for a small number of top performers who deliver \"truly exceptional impact.\"\n\n\"We're evolving our performance program to simplify it and placing greater emphasis on rewarding outstanding performance,\" a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider. \"While our employees have always been held to a high-performance, impact-based culture, this new direction allows for more frequent feedback and recognition in a more efficient way.\"\n\nThe memo says most employees will fall into \"Excellent\" because \"most people at Meta are high-performers who consistently deliver meaningful impact.\"\n\nThe company plans to host a companywide meeting on January 22 to walk employees through the changes and answer questions. The new updates apply to the 2026 performance year and do not affect the current cycle.\n\nMeta pitched the redesign as a time-saver. Managers, the memo says, spend about 80 hours a year on performance-related tasks, while employees collectively spend 330,000 hours per cycle on peer feedback. Yet fewer than 25% of managers say that feedback is helpful, the memo adds.\n\nUnder Checkpoint, Meta will transition to two cycles a year — mid-year and year-end — using the same rating scale in both cycles, with bonuses paid out twice annually. Meta will still deliver equity refresher grants once a year, though they will be based on the average of two performance ratings rather than a single annual rating. Merit increases will happen once a year following the second cycle.\n\nCheckpoint rolled out after Zuckerberg framed 2025 as an \"intense\" year and said Meta would tighten performance management, including cutting about 5% of low performers. In interviews, Meta employees and managers described the result as a tougher, more competitive environment where ratings mattered more than before.\n\nThe new system also streamlines Meta's previous rating system.\n\nEarlier, employees navigated different sets of labels depending on the time of year, including three mid-year buckets (such as \"Exceeds Expectations\" and \"Below Expectations\"), and a more granular year-end ladder that ranged from \"Redefines Expectations\" to \"Does Not Meet Expectations.\"\n\nMeta's latest revamp comes as the company has been tightening performance management in recent years. Meta plans to assess performance by AI-driven impact starting this year, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nLast year, it expanded the number of employees managers are expected to place in the lowest bucket. Meta instructed managers of large teams to rank 15% to 20% of employees as \"below expectations,\" up from 12% to 15% the previous year, after the company had earlier that year cut nearly 4,000 employees it had labeled as low performers, Business Insider reported last May.\n\nOther tech giants, such as Google and Amazon, also revised their performance review systems and pay structures to incentivize top performers. As part of this year's performance review process, Amazon will ask corporate employees to submit three to five \"accomplishments\" that best reflect their work, Business Insider reported.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "It’s all about safety, not comfort.",
    "fullText": "If you’re a frequent flier, it’s all too easy to board your plane and completely zone out. You find your seat, store your luggage, take note of the onboard amenities, and settle in for a, hopefully, smooth ride. But while you’re awaiting takeoff (and the Wi-Fi to kick in), the plane crew is actively at work, monitoring systems and procedures to get you to your destination safely.\n\n“During the critical phases of flight, specifically takeoff and landing, cabin hosts ensure the cabin is fully secure and passengers are seated, briefed, and prepared. This allows full focus on safety during the most sensitive portions of the flight,” Katherine Drossos, a trained flight attendant and in-flight supervisor at Cirrus Aviation Services, tells Travel + Leisure.\n\nPart of that preparation involves the safety briefing. We’re all familiar with the script covering seat belt usage, oxygen masks, and how to find your life vest in case of an emergency water landing. Upon takeoff—and then again at landing—you may also notice the cabin crew taking a certain position while seated. After buckling in, they either sit with their hands beneath their thighs or rest their palms face down on their legs.\n\n“What passengers often interpret as cabin hosts ‘sitting on their hands’ is actually a deliberate brace-ready position. Cabin hosts sit upright in the jump seat with feet flat on the floor and hands secured on their thighs or beneath the legs,” Drossos says. “This posture stabilizes the body, minimizes the risk of injury during sudden movement or turbulence, and ensures hands are immediately available to respond if an evacuation or safety action is required.”\n\nShe also notes that “while exact hand placement or posture may vary slightly by airline or aircraft type,” its purpose is the same: “maintaining stability, alertness, and immediate readiness during the most critical phases of flight.”\n\nWhile in this brace position, the cabin crew is simultaneously performing a mental checklist of sorts. “While seated, cabin hosts also conduct a silent safety review, mentally walking through emergency procedures, identifying exits, and confirming evacuation commands and responsibilities,” she explains.\n\nAs a passenger, you aren’t required to take the same brace position—although you’re certainly welcome to—but there are a few specific ways to keep yourself safe and secure during takeoff and landing. After giving your full attention to the crew’s safety briefing, review the safety card tucked into the seatback in front of you, and keep your seat belt fastened throughout the flight. Your seat should also remain upright during both takeoff and landing.",

    "fullText": "on January 12, 2026 at 12:04PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons is getting new content for the big 3.0 update arriving on January 15. This is a free update that brings new activities to the island and offers more ways to play with friends. There are even major collaborations with Lego, Splatoon, and The Legend of Zelda. In this guide we'll highlight everything you need to know about Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 update, including details about the new Resort Hotel and customizable islands for multiplayer.\n\nIf you are a new player or someone returning after a long hiatus, make sure you check out our complete guide hub for Animal Crossing: New Horizons. This offers starter tips, help with various features, and information on how to upgrade locations.\n\nWhen your Villager goes to sleep, they can now choose the option \"slumber time\" to go to a new dream world introduced in the 3.0 update.\n\nLuna's Dream World lets you fully customize a brand-new island with items you've previously obtained in game. You can build up to three Slumber Islands and choose from three different island sizes.\n\nWith Slumber Islands, you'll be able to exercise more creative freedom than ever before. You can alter the terrain to remove cliffs and widen rivers to your liking. You'll also have the option to place inclines and bridges. You're not tied to real-world time and weather in Slumber Islands, either. Instead, you can customize these details to create the look you want for your island.\n\nOne of the biggest highlights of Slumber Island is that you can invite or join friends to customize islands together. It's worth noting that you will need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription for online play.\n\nAnother big feature for 3.0 is the Resort Hotel. This new building is located at the end of the pier of your standard island and gives you a variety of guest rooms to decorate.\n\nThis waterfront hotel is run by Kapp'n and his family, and they want you to help decorate rooms to entice guests to stay. You'll earn Hotel Tickets for each room you decorate, a brand-new currency that is used to buy exclusive items added with the big update.\n\nIf you're a fashionista, you can also plan and suggest outfits for the hotel guests to wear during their stay. You can style and place outfits on hotel mannequins that will then be available for both you and your guests to wear.\n\nAs always, Tom Nook finds a new opportunity to make some Bells in the 3.0 update. He sees potential in the new Resort Hotel, but he wants your help to promote it. Craft special DIY items for him, and he'll reward you with more Hotel Tickets.\n\nThe game's previous storage limit was 5,000, but the 3.0 update will expand storage with two additional upgrades for a maximum of 9,000 items. You'll also be able to store trees, flowers, and shrubs.\n\nThe prices haven't been revealed yet, but if they're similar to the 2.0 update, you can expect to spend around 900,000 Bells and 1,200,000 Bells per upgrade.\n\nIt's finally time for easier island clean up. This update introduces Resetti's Reset Service, a new feature that gives you the ability to clear out flowers, furniture, and \n\nThis new cleaning service lets you pick a specific area for Resetti to clean, though you can also ask him to clean the entire island or limit it to just the beach area. You can also ask him to place items in storage after he cleans up. This means if you have a messy flower bed, but don't want to lose all your flowers, he can both remove and save them for you.\n\nAs you help the Resort Hotel, the building's souvenir shop will eventually start selling Nintendo items. You can purchase these exclusive items with the Hotel Tickets you earn.\n\nThese items include retro Nintendo consoles to decorate your home. If you have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, you can even play a retro game on each of the consoles you buy. This includes playing classics such as Dr. Mario and Ice Climber.\n\nIn addition to Nintendo items at the souvenir shop, you can also purchase Lego-themed items from the Nook Shopping app. This will let you decorate your home with Lego brick furniture, such as a sofa, bed, or fireplace. There is also Lego wallpaper and a t-shirt. These items all come in a variety of colors, so you can find something brick-themed to match your style.\n\nYou'll be able to add four Nintendo characters with Update 3.0, if you have their amiibo cards: Mineru and Tulin from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Cece and Viché, who are inspired by Callie and Marie from Splatoon.\n\nTapping their amiibo cards will let you invite them to your island, and it will also unlock unique items in Nook Shopping.",

    "title": "What Counts As Cardio (and What Doesn't)",
    "description": "Walking? Lifting weights? Does it matter what zone you’re in? I have answers.",
    "fullText": "Cardio is good for us. We need both cardio and strength training for basic health, as well as our athletic goals. But what actually counts as cardio? Can you count walking? Lifting weights? Anything so long as you’re in the right zone? Let me break it down.\n\nTrick question! “Cardio” is a nickname for a certain rough category of exercise, and it doesn't have a precise definition. You’ll find different definitions of it depending on who you ask, and a lot of the research on the benefits of cardio just calls it “exercise.\" The closest technical term is \"aerobic activity.\"\n\nThe Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans describes aerobic activity as when:\n\n...the body’s large muscles move in a rhythmic manner for a sustained period of time. Brisk walking, running, bicycling, jumping rope, and swimming are all examples. Aerobic activity causes a person’s heart to beat faster, and they will breathe harder than normal.\n\nThat matches the World Health Organization definition, as well as the way most fitness professionals use the terms \"aerobic\" or \"cardio\" exercise. Note that the key components are:\n\nIt uses large muscles (like the legs; you can’t get cardio by twiddling your thumbs)\n\nIt's rhythmic (as when you pedal a bicycle for hundreds of revolutions)\n\nIt can be sustained (like a 20-minute bike ride, but unlike a set of 10 squats)\n\nExercises that fit the definition include walking, running, cycling, swimming, and using machines like a rower, elliptical, or stair machine at the gym.\n\nNo, there isn’t a strict dividing line between what counts as cardio and what doesn’t. The guidelines I quote above treat “moderate” intensity cardio as the minimum to target, but that’s not defined in terms of heart rate. I have a breakdown here of what “moderate” really means, but briefly: Anything at the effort level of a normal-paced walk (about 20 minutes per mile) is moderate.\n\nI know that’s not the answer you were hoping to find, so here’s another data point: the American Heart Association says that moderate exercise corresponds to 50-70% of your maximum heart rate. (Vigorous is 70-85%.)\n\nMost of us don’t actually know our true max heart rate, and formulas like “220 minus your age” aren’t accurate. So take that with a grain of salt. It’s more helpful to consider how exercise feels: Moderate exercise will get you breathing heavier than at rest, maybe sweating a little bit, and with a noticeably higher heart rate than when you’re sitting quietly. You don’t have to be out of breath; moderate exercise is conversational, in the sense that you could, literally, engage in conversation while you do it.\n\nIf you want to get health benefits from cardio, you may want to pay more attention to intensity. Moderate exercise is great, but vigorous exercise (where it feels hard, and you won’t be able to speak in full sentences) is also excellent to have in the mix. The Norwegian 4x4 is an accessible cardio workout that features plenty of vigorous work.\n\nYes, in the sense that it meets the minimum guidelines. It is moderate intensity exercise and it counts toward your minutes per week (no matter what your heart rate is while you do it).\n\nBut if you have athletic goals, walking alone is probably not enough to achieve them. If walking feels easy, you probably want to increase the intensity to increase your cardio fitness. Jogging or rucking would be good next steps.\n\nNo, lifting weights does not count as cardio (with a few exceptions, which I’ll discuss in a minute.) Remember, cardio has to be rhythmic and sustained. If you aren’t doing the same movement over and over for, say, 10 minutes, it’s not cardio. So three sets of 10 on the chest press machine is definitely not cardio. You probably spent about five minutes in total, most of them resting. Doesn't count.\n\nAnd no, I won’t change my answer based on what your heart rate monitor says. Your heart rate only measures the intensity of cardio exercise if you are doing cardio exercise. Strength training is still strength training (not cardio) no matter what zone your heart rate is in.\n\nSo what are those exceptions I mentioned? Exercising with weights can count as cardio if it meets the definition: rhythmic and sustained. Most people don’t do this! But if you’re training for a kettlebell half marathon, which is 30 minutes of the same motion, continuously, with a light kettlebell (you aren’t allowed to put the kettlebell down until time is up), then yes, that is cardio.\n\nI would also categorize the kettlebell ladder workout as a form of cardio. I do so with reservations—it’s not continuous for the whole 30-ish minutes, but then again neither is a lot of interval training. Kettlebell swings are definitely rhythmic and involve large muscles, and the workout is designed to get your breathing and heartbeat going faster than usual for pretty much the whole time. I’ll allow it.\n\nHigh-intensity interval training definitely taxes your cardiovascular system, but it's not necessarily the best workout when you're looking for a way to get some cardio in. If you're doing true HIIT, it's very intense, very short, and may have longish rest periods in between the hard intervals. You're working your anaerobic system, not just your aerobic capacity, so it has some of the same caveats as lifting weights.\n\nWhat's more, a lot of \"HIIT\" videos out there aren't really HIIT, and aren't even necessarily good cardio. As I've written before, \"HIIT\" seems to mean \"a video with a timer in the corner,\" regardless of what kind of workout you get out of it. If you're looking for a good cardio workout, it's better to find something where you know you'll be working aerobically—which means being able to breathe rather than gasp—throughout the whole workout.\n\nI’ve given some examples already, but let me give you a longer list of things that are definitely cardio, if you do them in any sort of normal way (steady state or intervals, especially if the intervals use active rest like walking).\n\nRunning, jogging, or run/walk intervals (indoor or outdoor)\n\nPaddling or rowing a small boat\n\nDancing (truly the most underrated form of at-home cardio)\n\nStairmaster or stepmill machines\n\nClimbing machines like the Jacob’s Ladder or Versaclimber\n\nRoller skating or rollerblading\n\nYard work or housework that has you moving continuously (like pushing a lawn mower or shoveling snow)\n\nI also have a list of cardio options here that goes into more detail about many of the above, and here’s a list of chores and recreational activities that can also count (although many are moderate level, like walking).\n\nHopefully these examples help you choose some exercise to do. If you have specific athletic goals, though (like running a 5K or passing a fitness test for work) you’ll want to look into a training program that is geared toward those goals.",

    "description": "macOS 26 comes with an interesting (and frustrating) quirk.",
    "fullText": "Apple's latest crop of updates was met with a bit of a mixed reaction. While some users love the new Liquid Glass design across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, others decidedly do not—which is likely what led Apple to introduce a dedicated setting to control the intensity of the effect. I'm partial to it, but I understand for some users, it's a tad too much, especially if it makes certain UI elements more difficult to see.\n\nBut Liquid Glass isn't the only thing Apple users have complained about, especially with regards to macOS Tahoe. Mac users reported various problems with performance and stability across macOS 26.0 and macOS 26.1, and have criticized design choices like overly rounded corners. Myself, I held out on updating my M3 Pro Mac until macOS 26.2, where many of these issues appeared to be fixed, but my M1 iMac is still on macOS Sequoia for the time being. All that to say, macOS 26 hasn't had the smoothest start compared to some of Apple's previous Mac updates. If you've been noticing, for example, that your Mac's window management isn't as cooperative as it's been in the past, you're not alone. In fact, there seems to be a clear explanation for what's behind the issues.\n\nAs with other versions of macOS, you can resize and adjust your Mac apps' windows by clicking and dragging from the bottom corners. The issue, however, is that as of Apple's newest update, it can be fairly difficult to grab the corner of the window. You might, instead, find you click on the bottom corner of the app or website instead, leading to unintended actions. Clicking the top right corner of Chrome, for example, will drag the whole app window, rather than resize it. Clicking the bottom left corner and dragging will start to highlight everything in the app window instead, perhaps sending you all around the screen as well.\n\nIf you slowly hover your cursor over the corner of the window, eventually you'll find a spot that turns your cursor into a resize icon, and you'll know you're good to click and drag to resize. But why is this so much more difficult to do quickly than it was in macOS Sequoia or beyond?\n\nNorbert Heger, a software developer, seemingly has an answer. In a blog post on Sunday, Heger explains that those rounded corners Apple designed for Tahoe are having a negative impact on the clickable area of the window. With a square corner, most of the clickable area—Heger says 62% of it—lies within the corner of the window itself. That gives users a relatively large area to click within the corner in order to grab onto the window, and a little bit of room outside the window to click, as well. But these new rounded corners don't seem to take that into consideration. Instead, they're relying on the same click area as before, but because there's less corner to work with now, the actual clickable area of the window is far less. Heger says about 75% of the clickable area now exists outside the window itself, giving users just 25% to work with in the actual corner of the window.\n\nIf you're running macOS Tahoe, you can try this out for yourself right now: Move your cursor to the corner of the window, and wait for it to change into the resize icon. If you're hovering within the window itself, it won't change until you're just about to move outside the window. You can keep going a bit, and see you can get pretty darn far outside the window before the cursor changes back.\n\nThis seems like a relatively easy fix on Apple's part, assuming they're aware of the issue. Maybe a patch will even make it into macOS 26.3. That said, the company has not publicly acknowledged the quirk, so it's anyone's guess. Until a potential fix, those of us on macOS Tahoe will just need to retrain our muscle memories around window resizing. For anyone who hasn't upgraded yet, you can simply carry on as usual.",

    "fullText": "An arrest report revealed new details about a fight in the stands among fans at TD Garden during Saturday’s Boston Bruins-New York Rangers game that resulted in an arrest and hospitalization.\n\nAaron Tucker, 48, of Barre, Vermont, is slated to be arraigned on Friday on a charge of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and assault and battery on a person over the age of 60 in connection with the altercation.\n\nAccording to the arrest report, TD Garden detail officers responded to the arena’s Loge 2 section just after 3 p.m. for a report of an unconscious man who had fallen from the balcony level. After officers spoke with witnesses, they learned the victim was actually pushed while standing on the stairs in the section, causing him to fall backwards.\n\nWhen officers and security personnel located the 60-year-old victim, he was lying on the ground, semi-conscious, and breathing with his eyes slightly open near row AA in club section 113, the report stated. While enroute to Mass General Hospital for the treatment of a head injury, he allegedly told emergency officials that he drank “seven beers” and “had no memory” of the incident.\n\nOne witness told police that the victim was intoxicated and agitating Tucker and a woman he was sitting with, at one point raising his middle finger directly in their faces, according to the report. Another witness said Tucker and the victim continued to heckle each other before the push occurred.\n\n“He [witness] observed the victim continue to inch closer to the suspect and his wife, at which point the suspect grabbed the victim by the neck and pushed him, which caused him to fall backwards down the stairs,” police wrote in the report.\n\nNew video obtained by Boston 25 shows Boston police and EMS responding to the chaotic scene.\n\nTucker was wearing a Rangers hat and jersey, and the victim was harassing other Rangers fans leading up to the push, another witness told police. The victim’s friends had also been trying to get him to leave the arena to avoid continued escalation.\n\n“It shouldn’t happen,” a fan told Boston 25 News. “When the Rangers were here, they beat them 10 to 2; that’s when there are more fights.”\n\nOther witnesses reported seeing Tucker walk off toward the club level after the push as the victim rolled down “three to five” steps to the foyer below.\n\nInvestigators later spotted Tucker on surveillance video leaving the arena on Causeway Street and tracked him to the area of Endicott Street and Lafayette Avenue, where he was taken into custody without incident.\n\nTucker was booked at the Nashua Street Jail and later released on bail.\n\nDownload the FREE Boston 25 News app for breaking news alerts.\n\nFollow Boston 25 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch Boston 25 News NOW",

    "description": "Apple’s AI Siri is planned for this year, and it'll use Google Gemini.",
    "fullText": "It's been nearly two years since Apple announced a more intelligent Siri, and yet, we're still waiting to get our hands on it. Aside from being able to answer a few questions about Apple products or shunt your questions off to ChatGPT for you, the voice assistant is essentially still the same it was before Apple Intelligence launched for other Apple features in iOS 18.1. Now, the iPhone maker seems to be throwing in the towel on developing an AI-enabled Siri entirely on its own, and is asking Google for help. I can't imagine Tim Cook is too happy about that, but on the flip side, that does mean an AI Siri might finally come out, and soon.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC's Jim Cramer, Apple admitted that it is now planning to use Google Gemini to power its AI-infused Siri, rather than purely in-house models. The company said that, \"After careful evaluation, we determined that Google's technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we're excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users.\"\n\nPreviously, Apple had promised that its AI Siri would be able to do tasks on your behalf, like send a drafted email, or would be able to answer questions using context pulled from your phone, like surfacing a friend's address using information pulled from a text thread. Reportedly, however, implementing these features during testing kept breaking more traditional Siri features, like setting alarms and reminders, which has kept sending Apple back to the drawing board. The new, Gemini-powered voice assistant for Android faced similar issues at first, but based on my hands-on time with the company's latest phones, those growing pains seem to have subsided, so it makes sense that Google would be the first company Apple would turn to while looking for outside help.\n\nApple hasn't said too much more about the deal for now, but Google itself did step in to offer Apple users a bit more clarity, plus some reassurance about their data.\n\nIn a statement on X, the company assured Apple users that \"Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple's industry-leading privacy standards.\" That's the same deal Apple has with OpenAI right now, which allows its users to ask ChatGPT questions without the AI being able to train on them or keep a log of their requests. It essentially means Google won't get any data from your AI-powered Siri. Google's statement also confirmed a detail from CNBC's initial article, stating that its agreement with Apple will be a multi-year deal.\n\nPerhaps most exciting is that Google said the AI-powered Siri will come out \"this year,\" mirroring a statement an Apple spokesperson gave to Daring Fireball last March, admitting that an AI-enabled Siri was taking longer than anticipated and saying the company hoped to launch it in 2026. That's welcome relief to anyone who thought Apple had given up on the project.\n\nA more concrete timeline is still unknown, although Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, a reputable reporter with inside sources at Apple, has previously said to expect the AI Siri upgrade to launch in the spring. Personally, I could also see the company holding the launch until its annual WWDC event, which tends to happen in June.\n\nDespite Apple and Google's public feud as the makers of iOS and Android, respectively, this wouldn't mark the two companies' first time working together, especially in the mobile space. Previously, it was uncovered that Google and Apple have a lucrative deal to make Google the default search engine in Safari, which caused a lengthy legal battle that ultimately allowed the companies to maintain their deal, but barred exclusivity contracts. Part of the reasoning behind the AI Siri delay might be that the companies wanted to work together on AI before, but were holding off on it out of an abundance of caution. However, according to the courts, Google will also be able to make deals with outside distributors for \"preloading and placement\" of its GenAI products going forward, which seemingly puts both companies in the clear.",

    "description": "Teen trends, slang, and more, explained for you.",
    "fullText": "This weekly trip through the youth pop culture landscape takes us from turmoil in Stranger Things fandom, where many fans refuse to let the show end, to the kids' Wild West of Roblox, where age-verification is changing the landscape in a massive way, and all the way to Africa, where online mega-celebrity IShowSpeed is livestreaming a fascinating travelogue that people are watching all over the world.\n\nThe final episode of Netflix sci-fi series Stranger Things aired on Dec. 31 and it seems that many fans are not happy (shocking, right?). Some feel that the finale left too many loose ends, some that it all happened too easily, or that it was rushed, sloppy, and that it just kind of sucked. Some fans were so unhappy with the end of the series that they concluded it couldn't really be the end; there has to be more to it. Thus was born \"Conformity Gate,\" the fan-conspiracy-theory that states there is a secret, real ending to Stranger Things that Netflix hasn't released yet.\n\nIn a nutshell, Conformity Gate imagines that the events depicted in the last episode didn't actually happened in reality. The show's antagonist, Vecna, is in control of the story, and the seeming ending is an illusion that the characters (and audience) have been fed. The evidence is scant—props are slightly different from season to season or episode to episode, characters get small details wrong in dialogue, and other small differences. These are, I'm confident, the result of continuity and editing errors mixed with fans overanalyzing.\n\nI suspect the overarching issue with the end of Stranger Things is the same problem that has plagued other ambitious TV shows—Lost, Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, etc. There isn't a fully worked out ending when the show is pitched, leaving the show's creators to try to \"work something out\" for the ending, as opposed to going into it knowing exactly how it's going to come out. This is also why the first seasons of good shows are almost always better than the seasons that follow: The show's creators have fully plotted out the arc of the first season, but future events are more vague so the story feels slapdash instead of inevitable.\n\nAnyway, Charlie Heaton, who plays Jonathan Byers in Stranger Things, called the Conformity Gate theory \"insane,\" and the bio on Stranger Thing's X account was changed to read \"ALL EPISODES OF STRANGER THINGS ARE NOW PLAYING (all-caps are theirs.) This doesn't close the case on Stranger Things, though. There's still money to be made on the franchise, so I'd bet we see new content at some point; it just probably won't be a new ending.\n\nThe new year brings a world-shaking event to videogame Roblox: mandatory ID or facial verification. It works like this: if unverified users try to chat on Roblox, they are directed to give the game permissions to use their camera, then follow a series of online instructions so a verification algorithm can divine their age group based on their features. Users over 13 can submit a photo of an identification card instead. Roblox promises any images or videos taken during the verification process will be deleted after it is complete. Players who don't want to verify can still play Roblox, but they won't be able to use communication features within it. Once Roblox knows users' ages, it only allows them to chat with others in similar age groups. Here's how the company breaks down who may chat with whom:\n\nThe move is in response to longtime concerns about child safety within Roblox, which include organized groups of online predators like 764 using the game to recruit victims, Roblox mini-games with questionable content that are/were open to younger players, and at least 24 reported arrests of sex predators using Roblox to find victims.\n\nAn age-verified Roblox account is a positive step, but it's far from perfect. Videos like this are popping up on TikTok, where users seem to be sharing ways to get around the filter system. I have no idea if this would work, but if it does, not only would it let kids have more \"grown up\" accounts, it also could lead to grown-ups getting \"younger\" accounts. Online groomers often mimic the age group they're interested in, and a verified account seems like it would make this much easier. Another area of concern: Last week, users on X were linking to eBay accounts specifically advertised as \"13-15 age group accounts.\" Those auctions seem to have been taken down by eBay, but in the darker corners of the internet, I have no doubt that trade in verified Roblox accounts is brisk.\n\nThis week's slang word combines the words \"chopped\" and \"doppelgänger\" to deliver a massive insult. \"Chopped\" (as you can read in Lifehacker's glossary of Gen Z and Gen A slang) describes a person who is ugly, and doppelgänger means \"a ghostly duplicate of a living person,\" so a choppelganger is someone who looks like you, but worse. The term was coined in this post on X :\n\nAnd it was soon adopted by TikTokers who posted videos like these:\n\nIt's probably not the most widely used slang—there aren't too many places where the idea actually would come up—but it's definitely clever.\n\nThese are dark days for humanity, but there's some sunlight breaking through. This week's conformation of the essential goodness of people comes from YouTube legend IShowSpeed, who is in the middle of posting an epic series of livestream videos documenting a trip to Africa. The internet is responding, both in America and in Africa, with tens of millions of views.\n\nSo far, Speed has visited Rwanda, Zambia, Kenya (where he and his crew went on safari and visited the Maasai Mara where Speed got a traditional tattoo, among other adventures) and more. Many more stops are planned in the coming days, including Liberia, Morocco, and Botswana. Speed is like an informal ambassador for America's people, and his open, honest, hilarious videos are acting as a cultural exchange program or a bridge between two worlds. The comments are amazing, with African people posting things like, \"No words can capture the depth of what we feel as Africans. By simply revealing our humanity, you have compelled the world to witness the true brilliance of our continent—its beauty, its dignity, its spirit,\" and Americans saying things like, \"I didn’t know Zimbabwe was lit like that\" and posting emotional reaction videos like this:\n\nIf you need some hopium, you should definitely go to IShowSpeed's YouTube channel and follow along on his adventures, even if you're an old fart like me.",

    "title": "Microsoft Is Finally Working on a Worthy Answer to Apple's 'Handoff' Feature",
    "description": "Start using an app on your Android, then continue where you left off on your PC.",
    "fullText": "Love it or hate it, the Apple ecosystem really does have its perks. Take \"Handoff,\" for example. With this feature, you can be working in one app on one of your devices, then continue on in the same app on one of your other devices. You can start an article in Safari on your iPhone, then finish it on your Mac, without needing to google the piece and scroll to find your spot. It isn't 100%, but when it works, it's pretty great.\n\nMicrosoft actually offers a similar feature over on Windows, though it's so limited, you might not even know it exists. The feature is called Resume, and the idea is to allow you to pick up your place in an app from another device on your PC. For the most part, that means Android apps; so if you have a PC and an Android phone, Resume could offer the same benefits as someone with a Mac and an iPhone. However, so few apps actually work with Resume, that it's effectively useless.\n\nAs spotted by Windows Latest, Microsoft is making some serious updates to Resume. The company recently updated the Resume support document, which confirms Microsoft is opening the feature up to more Android apps.\n\nThe support document doesn't specify what apps might be coming, but it doesn't necessarily have to for this news to be exciting; rather, the development alone implies that many more Android apps will likely be on the way—assuming their developers simply get on board.\n\nAs Windows Latest explains, the reason Resume has been so limited is due to how restrictive Microsoft's API is. The only apps that can currently tap into Resume are ones that have access to the \"Link to Windows\" API. Many Android developers either don't know how to develop with this API, or simply can't, since their apps are not compatible.\n\nThe latest update to Resume offers developers another option, however: Now, developers can use Windows Notification System (WNS), a built-in API that is far more common and supports far more apps. That said, developers can't just update their apps with the WNS and expect to be compatible with Resume. Microsoft tells Windows Latest that developers need to reach out to Microsoft directly for approval. That application needs to include the developer's WNS registration, the app's Package SID, a summary of what the app does, and screenshots of the app in action.\n\nIt's basically like signing up for TSA PreCheck: Most of us who apply will likely get approved, but they don't just let anyone decide to join. You need to provide proof you qualify and submit for screening before you get there. That will likely end up working well for anyone who's interested in using Resume: The apps that will be available will all be vetted by Microsoft, so there should only be legitimate and useful apps offering that linking capability.\n\nThese changes probably won't roll out for some time on Windows. However, you can set yourself up for success now by turning the feature on. To start, head to Settings > Apps, then scroll until you find \"Resume.\" Here, turn on the feature. Right now, you'll probably see the only app that is compatible is OneDrive. You can connect it if you wish, which will let you work on a document across both your Android device and your PC.",

    "title": "Microsoft Is Finally Retiring Its Free Scanner App (but There Are Alternatives)",
    "description": "Microsoft is officially retiring Microsoft Lens, unless it decides to delay again.",
    "fullText": "Nothing lasts forever. Devices lose support, standards are replaced, and software becomes obsolete. So it is with Microsoft Lens, whose days are numbered. Keen observers have known about this since August, when Microsoft first announced that Lens would be retired in September and removed from app stores in November. That obviously didn't happen, as the company adjusted the deadline to Dec. 15, which also came and went. Microsoft kicked the retirement can down the road—that is, until now.\n\nMicrosoft Lens was Microsoft's solution for anyone in the mid-2010s who didn't own a scanner. Rather than buy an expensive piece of hardware to digitize documents, Lens allowed people to use their smartphone camera to turn those hard copies into digital files. It was hardly the only document scanner available on app stores (Apple's Notes app has had the function built in since iOS 11), but because it was made by Microsoft, it was a good solution for getting files into Microsoft apps like Word, PowerPoint, or Excel. It's also free and compatible with both Android and iOS, making the app universally accessible. We even listed it first in our roundup of the best document scanner apps from 2021.\n\nAccording to the app's support document, Microsoft Lens officially began retirement proceedings on Jan. 9. That doesn't mean the app is dead, though: Microsoft will still support it until Feb. 9. After that, the app will receive no updates, and Microsoft will remove it from app stores. (If you're passionate or curious about Microsoft Lens, make sure to install it before then.) No matter what, however, you'll only have another month to use it. As of March 9, you will no longer be able to create new scans in Lens, but you'll still be able to view your previous scans as long as the app remains on your device.\n\nOnce we settle into mid-March, Microsoft Lens users will need to choose an alternative scanning app. Fortunately, there are plenty of options on app stores to choose from. In fact, you might not need to download anything new at all: As mentioned above, iPhone users can tap into the Notes app's built-in scanner, while Google Drive users can do the same.\n\nMicrosoft, of course, wants you to stay within the ecosystem, so they'd prefer you use OneDrive's built-in scanner. If you already have that app on your phone, it might be as good an option as any. However, there are popular, dedicated apps, like Genius Scan, Adobe Scan, and Photomyne, that offer additional features not available in built-in scanners.",

    "fullText": "Ulster's general manager Rory Best says it is \"unfortunate\" Sunday's European Challenge Cup game in the Netherlands was called off, but insists \"player health and safety\" was the sole reason behind its cancellation.\n\nInitially the teams were due to play in Amsterdam but with the weather forecast predicting sub-zero temperatures, European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) decided on Friday to switch the game to Duke Rugby Club in the more southern city of s-Hertogenbosch, where it would be played behind closed doors.\n\nWith the teams at the venue prior to the 13:00 GMT kick-off, EPCR said the pitch was \"deemed impracticable by the referee and posing a risk to players welfare\" because of the continued freezing conditions.\n\nOn Sunday evening, EPCR confirmed the game would not be rescheduled and Ulster were awarded a 28-0 win and maximum points because of competition rules stating that the host club are responsible for the game going ahead.\n\nThere had been suggestions the game could potentially be rescheduled for Monday but \"with it being a Sunday game, logistically it was never going to be a runner to replay the game at another venue or on another date\" according to Best.\n\n\"On the morning of the game, the team travelled and in their head, they were focused and ready to play a match,\" Best told Ulster Rugby TV.\n\n\"When the match officials arrived, within communications with our team manager and team doctor, the decision was taken it was unplayable.\n\n\"As much as we want to play a match, you have to take player health and safety into this. When a pitch isn't playable, it's unfortunate but the game can't go ahead.\n\n\"Duke Rugby Club did everything they could to have the game go ahead, we were there ready to play along with the Cheetahs, but in conjunction with our team and their team, the referee took what we feel was the correct decision to cancel.\"",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge on Monday nixed a former high-ranking Justice Department official’s attempt to join the team defending ex-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s defense team, ruling that lawyer Bruce Fein had “no legal basis\" to do so.\n\nJudge Alvin K. Hellerstein had initially approved Fein’s application to join Maduro’s drug trafficking case but reversed course after the deposed leader’s actual lawyer, Barry Pollack, objected to his involvement.\n\nFein, an associate deputy attorney general during Ronald Reagan’s presidency, claimed in court papers that “individuals credibly situated” within Maduro’s inner circle or family had sought out his assistance. Fein claimed that Maduro “had expressed a desire” for his “assistance in this matter.”\n\nBut Hellerstein said in a written order that only Maduro has the authority to retain Fein as his lawyer, not unidentified individuals. He rejected Fein's request for the judge to summon Maduro to court to ask him if he would like Fein added to the defense team.\n\n“If Maduro wishes to retain Fein, he has the ability to do so,\" Hellerstein wrote. \"Fein cannot appoint himself to represent Maduro.\"\n\nMessages seeking comment were left Monday for Fein and Pollack.\n\nPollack, a prominent Washington lawyer whose clients have included WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, was the only lawyer with Maduro at his Jan. 5 arraignment in Manhattan federal court, days after U.S. special forces seized Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, from their home in Caracas.\n\nIn court, Maduro called it a kidnapping and declared himself a prisoner of war. Pollack told Hellerstein he expected to make “substantial” court filings challenging the legality of his military abduction\" and invoking immunity as the head of a sovereign state.\n\nAs Fein sought to join the case, Pollack said in a court filing last week that he'd spoken with Maduro and that the ex-leader confirmed to him that he doesn't know Fein and has not communicated with him, much less retained him or authorized him to join the case.\n\nFein acknowledged in a written response that he'd had no contact with Maduro by telephone, video or any other direct way.\n\nMaduro and Flores have pleaded not guilty to charges alleging he worked with drug cartels to facilitate the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the U.S. They remain held without bail at a federal jail in Brooklyn and are due back in court on March 17.",

The balls are hugging the rail. The top slates need levelling up. The table fitters need to go out and check the level of the top slate.\n\n\"If those balls are hugging that top rail, then it's going to make the game incredibly easy to make big breaks. It's also wrong that a ball should go in that easily. This looks like it's not level.\"\n\nIn response, the organisers of the invitation-only Masters, which typically features only the top-16 ranked players in the world, said: \"The table is checked before, during and after every match, as is standard at any event.\n\n\"We strive to provide the best possible playing conditions and our team of expert table fitters do a fantastic job.\"",

Parts of New England may still have lingering snow on Friday.\n\n\"Plowable snow accumulations are most likely across the interior of the Northeast. Higher elevations of the Appalachians and across northern New England will also be more likely to have several inches of snow late in the week,\" said AccuWeather Meteorologist Brandon Buckingham.\n\nSome of the highest snow totals are predicted downwind of the Great Lakes, added Buckingham.\n\nInches of snow piling up across the interior Northeast can lead to slippery travel as early as Wednesday evening and continue into Thursday night.\n\nPlaces like Pittsburgh and Buffalo, New York, could have slippery Wednesday afternoon and evening commutes, while some of the heaviest snow will fall in central and eastern New York on Wednesday night.\n\nGET THE FREE ACCUWEATHER APP\n•Have the app?

Wind gusts to around 40 mph will be possible across the Northeast and New England Thursday and Thursday night, adding further to any visibility concerns.\n\nWill it snow along the Interstate 95 corridor?\n\nGiven the storm track, it seems unlikely that several inches of snow will accumulate in cities like Philadelphia and New York City. However, it's not out of the question that flakes would fly in these cities.\n\nA burst of snow is possible late on Thursday in New York City, which could bring slippery spots and reduced visibility in time for travelers. Some of the far northern and western suburbs could get a coating to an inch of snow.\n\nEven without a blockbuster snowstorm for the Interstate 95 cities, there could still be impacts to travel across the region. \"With cold infiltrating the Northeast Thursday night, it would be easy for untreated surfaces, even wet surfaces, to freeze up and bring slippery spots for the Friday morning commute,\" Buckingham added.\n\nAreas across New England, such as eastern Massachusetts and Down East Maine, will be more susceptible to higher snowfall totals, with the potential for the storm to linger into Friday for these regions. A slippery coating to an inch is forecast for Boston.\n\nCold and snow chances are likely to continue following this storm.\n\nPersistent cold air and an active storm track is expected to bring additional rounds of snow for the Great Lakes and the Northeast, as soon as this weekend but even through next week.\n\nSnow lovers and skiers dismayed by the recent thaw will at least have something to be happy about with the return of persistent cold air.\n\nResorts will be able to make new snow to rebuild their base, and lake-effect snow showers may coat the landscape again in some areas.\n\nWant next-level safety, ad-free?

    "description": "President Donald Trump issued a grave warning on Monday, warning that \"WE'RE SCREWED\" if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs he's unilaterally imposed.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump issued a grave warning on Monday, warning that “WE’RE SCREWED” if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs he’s unilaterally imposed on much of the rest of the world.\n\n“The actual numbers that we would have to pay back if, for any reason, the Supreme Court were to rule against the United States of America on Tariffs, would be many Hundreds of Billions of Dollars, and that doesn’t include the amount of ‘payback’ that Countries and Companies would require for the Investments they are making on building Plants, Factories, and Equipment, for the purpose of being able to avoid the payment of Tariffs,” declared Trump in a post on Truth Social.\n\n“When these Investments are added, we are talking about Trillions of Dollars! It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay. Anybody who says that it can be quickly and easily done would be making a false, inaccurate, or totally misunderstood answer to this very large and complex question. It may not be possible but, if it were, it would be Dollars that would be so large that it would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even, who, when, and where, to pay,” he continued. “Remember, when America shines brightly, the World shines brightly. In other words, if the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE’RE SCREWED!”\n\nThe Court’s ruling on the matter is expected to be released in the near future, and possibly even this Wednesday.\n\nAfter the Department of Commerce released figures last month indicating that the economy had grown at an impressive annualized rate of 4.3% between last July and September, Trump credited his trade policy.\n\n“The TARIFFS are responsible for the GREAT USA Economic Numbers JUST ANNOUNCED…AND THEY WILL ONLY GET BETTER!” he argued at the time. “Also, NO INFLATION & GREAT NATIONAL SECURITY. Pray for the U.S. Supreme Court!!!”\n\nThe Court heard the case, which challenges Trump’s authority to levy the import taxes without congressional action, in November. During oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts characterized the tariffs as “taxes on Americans” in a moment that some court-watchers believed portended poorly for the administration.\n\nThe post ‘WE’RE SCREWED’: Trump Issues Grave Warning About Supreme Court Striking Down Tariff ‘Bonanza’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "It was one of those moments that Dominik Szoboszlai will never, ever want to watch again.\n\nIn the same half in which the 25-year-old scored a belter that arguably no keeper would have saved, the Liverpool midfielder made a mistake that was described as \"disrespectful\" by Barnsley manager Conor Hourihane and \"weird\" by his own boss, Arne Slot.\n\nAfter sprinting and winning the ball ahead of Adam Phillips, Szoboszlai tried to backheel the ball in his own box to Liverpool keeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, but scuffed the ball and left Phillips with a tap-in.\n\nIt proved inconsequential in the end but was the main talking point post-match.\n\n\"I don't think you should do that in an FA Cup or League Cup game, a friendly game or even a training session,\" said Slot. \"It's a weird choice and I have my opinion about it but I prefer to keep that to myself and speak about that with Dom.\"\n\nFor Hourihane, there was a sense of anger with the fact that Szoboszlai tried to backheel the ball in the first place.\n\n\"I was disappointed with our goal because he [Szoboszlai] doesn't do that against Chelsea or Arsenal,\" Hourihane told TNT Sports.\n\nAsked if it was disrespectful, Hourihane added: \"Yeah, potentially. I don't think he does that in a Premier League game or in a Champions League game so I was a little bit disappointed with that. It was a bit of a lack of respect.\n\n\"Delighted for Adam, but disrespectful from their player's point of view.\"\n\nAside from the error, Szoboszlai's performance was impressive as he became the first Premier League player this season to score a goal, complete 100+ passes (105) and win possession 10+ times (12) in a single match.\n\n\"I'm sorry for the team again. I made it hard for us with an easy mistake I would say. But football moves on and we take the next round,\" he said.\n\nEx-Crystal Palace and Reading winger Jobi McAnuff told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"The first half was almost too easy for Liverpool at times. Yes Barnsley had a couple of opportunities and didn't take them prior to their goal and as an opponent you get yourself into a mindset of doing things you wouldn't normally do.\n\n\"The game was safe at that point and it's just one of those horrendous situations. It looks worse the more you watch it back. Whatever he's done, he's got it all wrong.\"\n\nOn TNT Sports, former Manchester City defender Joleon Lescott agreed the error was \"disrespectful\", while ex-Scotland striker Ally McCoist described it as \"incredible\".",

    "description": "Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had “a very good conversation” with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday and that their two governments will continue working together on security issues without the need for U.S. intervention against drug cartels.",
    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had “a very good conversation” with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday and that their two governments will continue working together on security issues without the need for U.S. intervention against drug cartels.\n\nThe approximately 15-minute call came after Sheinbaum said Friday she had requested dialogue with the Trump administration at the end of a week in which he had said he was ready to confront drug cartels on the ground and repeated the accusation that cartels were running Mexico.\n\nTrump has repeatedly offered to send the U.S. military after the cartels and Sheinbaum has always declined, but after the U.S. removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, Trump’s comments about Mexico, Cuba and Greenland carried new weight.\n\n“He (Trump) asked me my opinion about what they had done in Venezuela and I told him very clearly that our constitution is very clear, that we do not agree with interventions and that was it,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nTrump “still insisted that if we ask for it, they could help” with military forces, which Sheinbaum said she again rejected. “We told him, so far it’s going very well, it’s not necessary, and furthermore there is Mexico’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and he understood.”\n\nIn an interview with Fox News aired last Thursday, Trump said, “We’ve knocked out 97% of the drugs coming in by water and we are going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels. The cartels are running Mexico. It’s very sad to watch.”\n\nSheinbaum said Monday the two leaders agreed to continue working together.\n\nMexico’s Foreign Affairs Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente spoke Sunday with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Rubio asked for “tangible results” and more cooperation to dismantle the cartels, according to a statement from the U.S. State Department.\n\nSheinbaum said Mexico shared those results, including a significant drop in homicides, falling U.S. fentanyl seizures and fentanyl overdose deaths.\n\nExperts still see U.S. intervention in Mexico as unlikely because Mexico is doing what the U.S. asks and is a critical economic partner, but expect Trump to continue using such rhetoric to maintain pressure on Mexico to do more.\n\nSheinbaum said the two leaders did not speak about Cuba, which Trump threatened Sunday. Mexico is an important ally of the island nation, including selling it oil that it will need even more desperately now that the Trump administration says it will not allow any more oil shipments from Venezuela to Cuba.",

    "description": "Security camera video has been released in the Marcus Freeman case. Watch it here.",
    "fullText": "This story has been altered to add new information.\n\nThe Mishawaka Police Department released the surveillance video of the alleged incident between Notre Dame football head coach Marcus Freeman and New Prairie High School assistant wrestling coach Chris Fleeger.\n\nIn the video, released Monday, Jan. 11, Freeman is standing in the top-left corner of the screen, wearing a navy blue jacket, gray hoodie with the hood up, watching his son, Vinny, compete in the Al Smith Wrestling Invitational at Mishawaka High School. The match ends and the wrestlers go through their customary post-match handshakes with themselves and opposing coaches.\n\nOriginal story: Notre Dame says accusations against Marcus Freeman 'unfounded'\n\nIt's at that point, around 45 seconds into the video, where Fleeger appears to come over and start interacting with the Freeman's and Penn head coach Brad Harper. As the Penn contingent goes to leave, Fleeger appears to follow them, leading to a confrontation near the doorway.\n\nThe talking goes for several seconds before it appears to continue in the hallway. It's hard to tell from that point what happens.\n\nFleeger filed a police report against Freeman, claiming he made physical contact with him. The Mishawaka Police Department investigated the case and found no evidence of this claim. Police turned the final investigative report over to the St. Joseph County prosecutor, who issued a news release Jan. 11 declining to press any criminal battery charges against Freeman.\n\n\"While the video of the incident is from a distance, officers were able to identify Mr. Freeman and the Complainant,\" the prosecutor's statement read. \"In the video, officers were able to observe Mr. Freeman moving to leave a crowded gym with his son. The exit doors were partially blocked by other people. As Mr. Freeman walked toward the doors, the video shows the Complainant moving from his position near the doors and approach Mr. Freeman. Mr. Freeman turned toward the Complainant and paused for approximately one second. Mr. Freeman then left the auditorium at a walk.\n\n\"The video shows that while Mr. Freeman’s right arm is not fully visible, his left hand remained in a pocket during the interaction between the Complainant and Mr. Freeman. The head and body movements of both the Complainant and Mr. Freeman do not support the supposition that any violent physical contact occurred.\"\n\nPer the release, \"the video does not support the claim that Mr. Freeman gave the Complainant a 'two handed push' nor that the Complainant stumbled backwards after the incident as originally alleged by the Complainant and his acquaintances.\"\n\nIn the prosecutor's release, it's noted that Fleeger tried to recruit Vinny Freeman to be part of his club team in New Carlisle and wrestle for New Prairie High School, an offer the Freeman family declined.\n\nA witness was quoted in the prosecutor's release that Fleeger has voiced his anger at the Freeman family in the past, even telling other wrestlers to try to purposefully injure Vinny. Fleeger denied those claims in the report.\n\nAustin Hough is a sports editor within the Center for Community Journalism at USA Today Co., overseeing high school sports and Notre Dame athletics coverage for five Indiana newspapers.

    "description": "Google cofounder Sergey Brin studied graduate computer science at Stanford—but admits Gen Z no longer needs a degree to land a high-paying job at the tech giant.",
    "fullText": "Whether it’s Nike’s Phil Knight, LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, or Google’s Sergey Brin, many of the world’s most influential business founders can trace part of their success back to Stanford University. Nestled in the foothills of Silicon Valley, the school has long functioned as a launchpad for tech’s elite.\n\nBut the rise of artificial intelligence is challenging long-held assumptions about the value of higher education. As tech reshapes entry-level work and companies rethink traditional hiring pipelines, the payoff of a four-year degree—especially from elite institutions—is increasingly up for debate.\n\nStill, Brin doesn’t regret his own academic path. Speaking to Stanford engineering students last month, he said his decision to study computer science was not driven by a fixation on credentials.\n\n“I chose computer science because I had a passion for it,” he said. “It was kind of a no-brainer for me. I guess you could say I was also lucky because I was also in such a transformative field.”\n\nEven in an era when AI can write code, Brin cautioned students against chasing—or abandoning—fields of study based solely on automation fears.\n\n“I wouldn’t go off and switch to comparative literature because you think the AI is good at coding,” he said. “The AI is probably even better at comparative literature, just to be perfectly honest anyway.”\n\nBrin met Google cofounder Larry Page in 1994 during his second year of graduate studies at Stanford. Together they developed PageRank, an algorithm they later renamed Google and would become a company in 1998.\n\nGoogle’s hiring practices today reflect how dramatically the industry has shifted. The tech giant is now embracing workers without college degrees.\n\n“In as much as we’ve hired a lot of academic stars, we’ve hired tons of people who don’t have bachelor’s degrees,” Brin said. “They just figure things out on their own in some weird corner.”\n\nBetween 2017 and 2022, the share of job postings at Google requiring a degree dropped from 93% to 77%, according to analysis from the Burning Glass Institute. And Google isn’t alone: companies including Microsoft, Apple, and Cisco have reduced degree requirements in recent years, signaling a broader industry shift toward skills-based hiring.\n\nThat’s forcing a broader reckoning over what a degree actually signals and whether it’s still a reliable proxy for talent.\n\n“I don’t think necessarily because you go to an Ivy League school or have great grades it means you’re going to be a great worker or great person,” said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in 2024. For many roles, skills matter far more than credentials, he added: “If you look at skills of people, it is amazing how skilled people are in something, but it didn’t show up in their resume.”",

    "fullText": "Authorities in Westminster, a suburb in Orange County, are looking to spread awareness of vandalism at the Westminster Mall, which closed last October but has since become a hotbed of illicit activity.\n\nAccording to the Westminster Police Department, the mall has been boarded up since its closure; however, people still are finding ways to enter. One look inside shows that trespassers have trashed the mall, smashing glass storefronts, throwing leftover merchandise around and spray painting much of the interior.\n\nWestminster police say that, since the mall shut down, their department has received 402 calls for service for various crimes, including vandalism and trespassing. Individuals with arrest warrants have also been apprehended there, per WPD.\n\nA witness told KTLA that this weekend, they saw around 60 people in the mall at once — with no police or security in sight. They submitted pictures and video of the damaged mall but insisted they were “only there for footage” and did not participate in the vandalism.\n\nJust this past weekend, at least 30 people were arrested for vandalism, a Westminster Police Department spokesperson confirmed to KTLA. The spokesperson added that investigators believe the recent uptick in incidents may have to do with videos circulating online that show the vandalized interior.\n\nHowever, those videos are not an invitation to enter the mall, the spokesperson stated.\n\n“This has become a safety issue,” they said. “Anyone trespassing will get arrested.”",

    "fullText": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) pulled no punches on Monday in roasting her former fellow Senate Democrat, Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ). Warren spoke at the National Press Club and accused Sinema of “cashing in from the industry she protected.”\n\n“Many voters are rightly skeptical that we’ll really make something happen,” Warren said, referring to party policy on fixing the affordability crisis.\n\n“After all, we didn’t even take the extraordinarily obvious and simple step of increasing the minimum wage the last time we had power. Ask Kyrsten Sinema, the former Democratic senator from Arizona, who curtsied on the Senate floor while rejecting a minimum wage increase in 2021 to raise wages for up to 27 million Americans, and then spent the rest of her time in office protecting hedge fund managers from paying taxes and blocking filibuster reform,” Warren said, adding:\n\nSinema faced no consequences from her president or her leaders in Washington. Eventually, it was her own constituents back home who chased her out of the Senate. But today, she is cashing in from the industry she protected. The Wall Street Journal recently marveled at the sheer number of projects Sinema has taken on from crypto, AI, and other wealthy corporate clients. And meanwhile, millions of working Americans who have not seen a minimum wage increase in almost two decades are still waiting for Democrats to deliver on one of our most basic promises.\n\nSinema sparked fury on the left during her time in office for skuttling some of the Democrats’ top policy agenda items during President Joe Biden’s term, including closing the “carried interest” loophole that benefits hedge fund managers and stopping an increase in corporate taxes.\n\nWatch the clip above via C-SPAN.\n\nThe post Elizabeth Warren Accuses Former Democratic Colleague of Blatant Corruption: ‘She Is Cashing In’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

Its technology already drives much of Samsung's \"Galaxy AI,\" but the Siri deal unlocks a large market with Apple's installed base ‌of more than two billion active devices.\n\n\"After careful evaluation, Apple determined Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,\" Google said, adding that its models will also power other future Apple Intelligence features.\n\nAlphabet has been jostling with OpenAI for the Apple deal, the financial details of which were not disclosed.\n\nThe iPhone maker had in late 2024 rolled out ChatGPT into its ⁠devices, allowing the company's Siri voice assistant ‌to tap into the chatbot's expertise to answer complicated questions.\n\nApple said there were no major changes to the ChatGPT integration at the time, while OpenAI did not respond to Reuters' request for ‍comment.\n\n\"This seems like an unreasonable concentration of power for Google, given that (they) also have Android and Chrome,\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a post on social media platform X.\n\nMusk founded his own AI firm xAI that has been trying to compete with other major players ​in the industry by building foundational models and spending billions on massive infrastructure.\n\nMonday's tie-up will likely raise questions on OpenAI's ‌partnership with Apple. In response to Gemini 3, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman late last year reportedly issued a \"code red\" to push teams to accelerate development.\n\n\"Apple's decision to use Google's Gemini models for Siri shifts OpenAI into a more supporting role, with ChatGPT remaining positioned for complex, opt-in queries rather than the default intelligence layer,\" said Parth Talsania, CEO of Equisights Research.\n\nGoogle has been firing on all cylinders to counter OpenAI's early lead in the industry by doubling down on frontier models, and ⁠image and video generation.\n\nApple has faced a series of setbacks on the ​AI front after being late to the race, with Siri's upgrade getting ​delayed, top-level executive changes and the initial rollout of its generative AI tools being met with lukewarm reception.\n\nThe latest agreement builds on a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on ‍Apple devices - a lucrative arrangement that ⁠drives traffic for Google while generating tens of billions in annual revenue for Apple.",

In the demo, the network averaged 278,000 viewers, down five percent year-over-year.\n\nIt should be noted that Nielsen changed its rating methodology last year, so the way numbers are measured compared to 2024 could be skewed.\n\nIn total day, Fox News averaged 1.691 million total viewers (up 16 per cent compared to 2024) and 180,000 in the key demo (down 3 per cent).\n\nFox News topped the charts for total primetime viewers across all cable networks and placed third in the demo. It also held the top spot for total viewers across total day and ranked second in the demo.\n\nMS NOW (MSNBC until November 2025) averaged 915,000 total viewers (down 15 per cent on 2024) and 80,000 demo viewers (down 40 per cent on last year) in primetime. During total day, MS NOW averaged 551,000 total viewers (down 30 per cent) and 48,000 demo viewers (down 43 per cent).\n\nOverall, MS NOW ranked third in total primetime viewers across all basic cable networks and dropped from ninth to 19th in the demo.

What they are asking is for their pensions to be safeguarded, to be protected in their own workplace, to receive the pay and the health benefits ⁠that they deserve,\" Mamdani told ‌reporters.\n\nMount Sinai said that the union's proposals would cost it $1.6 billion over three years, with a $638 million increase in nursing costs by the third ‍year, which is 74% more than current costs.\n\nNew York State Gov. Kathy Hochul had declared a disaster emergency last week, allowing out-of-state and foreign medical personnel to cover for striking staff. The disaster emergency ​is in effect until February 8.\n\nOn Monday morning, dozens of nurses spoke of lack of ‌healthcare benefits and inability to take adequate breaks during their shifts as they rallied outside a NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in uptown Manhattan. NewYork-Presbyterian is one of three healthcare networks affected by the strike along with Mount Sinai and Montefiore.\n\n\"In the operating room, I work as a night nurse and we're always short on staffing and this is unsafe for the patient,\" said Michael ⁠Lazar, a 53-year-old NewYork-Presbyterian nurse.\n\nMount Sinai said it ​had secured more than 1,000 qualified and specialized agency ​nurses to cover for striking medics and to deliver care for \"however long a strike may last.\"\n\nNewYork-Presbyterian said all of its hospitals were open and continued ‍to provide services.\n\nMontefiore did ⁠not immediately respond to a request for comment. A notice on its website said that services would not be impacted by the strike.\n\nThe union and the hospitals held ⁠the last round of the negotiations the day before the strike, according to Mount Sinai and NYSNA. As ‌of Monday evening, there was no information about the next talks.",
