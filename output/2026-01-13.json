    "fullText": "The UFC’s return to Mexico City has added a battle between ranked bantamweights.\n\nMultiple people with knowledge of the promotion’s plans confirmed to MMA Fighting that Marlon Vera faces David Martinez at UFC Mexico. The event takes place Feb. 28 at Arena CDMX and streams on Paramount+.\n\nEurosport NL was first to report the booking.\n\nVera looks to right the ship as he enters the bout on a three-fight losing streak. After bouncing back with a decision win over Pedro Munhoz at UFC 292 in August 2023, “Chito” faced Sean O’Malley for the bantamweight title at UFC 299 in March 2024, dropping a unanimous decision. Since then, Vera dropped decisions to Deiveson Figueiredo and — most recently — Aiemann Zahabi at UFC Vancouver this past October.\n\nMartinez already finds himself in the bantamweight rankings after just two octagon appearances. The Contender Series alum delivered a first-round knockout against Saimon Oliveira in his UFC debut, but took a big short notice opportunity in his sophomore outing at Noche UFC, picking up an impressive decision victory over Rob Font this past September.\n\nUFC Mexico is headlined by a flyweight matchup between former champion Brandon Moreno and Asu Almabayev.",

    "fullText": "The Boston Red Sox are scrambling to pick up the pieces after Alex Bregman shockingly signed with the Chicago Cubs in free agency on a five-year, $175 million contract. On Tuesday, another one of the team’s top targets, St. Louis Cardinals third baseman Nolan Arenado, appears to have come off the board.\n\nArenado has been a longtime trade target for the Sox, and with the team having already swung a pair of deals with the Cardinals earlier this offseason for Sonny Gray and Willson Contreras, it seemed like he could be a possible replacement for Bregman at third base.\n\nInstead, Arenado has reportedly been dealt to the Arizona Diamondbacks. On the surface, it’s tough to see Boston miss out on another one of its targets, but could this deal actually end up being beneficial for the Red Sox?\n\nOne of the players the Sox have been heavily linked to all offseason long is Diamondbacks second baseman Ketel Marte. However, general manager Mike Hazen recently said that after a couple of weeks of negotiations with other teams, he was taking Matre off the trade block.\n\nNow that Arenado is in town, though, that could conceivably change the team’s stance on a trade involving Marte. The two guys don’t play the same position, but adding another infielder into the mix could allow Arizona to get creative with its roster configuration moving forward.\n\nWith Bregman off the market, Boston could use Marte now more than ever before. Not only would he fill a position of need in the middle infield, but Marte is a strong switch-hitting bat at the plate, as he hit .283 with 28 home runs and 72 RBIs last season.\n\nIt certainly couldn’t hurt for the Red Sox to check in on Marte again, but it doesn’t seem like this deal will automatically result in the Diamondbacks changing their stance on his future with the team. Arizona still doesn’t have a true option at second base to replace him, even after adding a de facto starter at third base in Arenado.\n\nBoston had a shot to acquire Marte earlier this offseason, but it missed its chance to do so. With Bregman gone, the sense of urgency inside the front office has increased, and while Marte would be a perfect fit in the lineup, it doesn’t seem likely that he will be coming to town anytime soon, even after Arizona’s latest big move.\n\n5 Hitters Red Sox Should Target After Losing Alex Bregman",

    "description": "How do you feel Tyler Booker performed this season?",
    "fullText": "All year long we’ve looked at the rookie class and given previews and reviews on each player for every game of the season. Now let’s look back the season in its entirety and breakdown each rookie and how they performed. Let’s start with first-round offensive guard Tyler Booker.\n\nSeason stats- Snaps: 1,003, Pass Blocks: 631, Pressures: 25, Sacks: 3, Penalties: 7\n\nBooker’s first season in Dallas looks very much like the start of a long-term answer at guard after the departure of Zack Martin. Drafted 12th overall and dropped straight into the starting lineup, he finished his rookie year as the Cowboys’ clear Rookie of the Year and one of the few unquestioned wins on a team that struggled for consistency. Across the season he handled a huge workload in protection and the most of any rookie interior lineman, yet he allowed only three sacks all year. For a first-year right guard that is big-time reliability.\n\nThe advanced numbers back up the eye test. Booker allowed 25 pressures, which puts him inside the top tier of all right guards, not just first-year players. ESPN’s trench metrics chart him with a pass-block win rate around 95%, comfortably above league average for guards and a big reason Dallas ranked in the top half of the league in pass protection despite broader offensive struggles.\n\nBooker’s work in the run game is just as important. PFF graded him with a 76.8 run blocking grade, that’s seventh-best among all guards this year. You can see his impact in games like the Christmas win over Washington, where the Cowboys piled up 211 rushing yards and repeatedly gashed the interior. Even late in the year when most rookies hit the wall, Booker was still there helping the offense to 143 rushing yards at 4.8 yards per carry against the New York Giants. He wasn’t a perfect finisher on every snap, but the pattern was clear, when Dallas wanted to run between the tackles, they were happy to run behind him.\n\nThere were bumps along the way. Early in the season he suffered a high-ankle sprain, missed time, and came back in Week 7 still finding his rhythm. In his first three NFL starts he allowed nine total pressures, and even later in the year there were games where stunts and late movement bothered him and where his penalties cropped up in bad spots. Coaches, and Booker himself, talked about consistency as the main lesson from year one. That lines up with the numbers where three sacks and 25 pressures on that many pass-block reps is excellent, but seven penalties and some rough stretches after the injury give him obvious points to attack in his second season.\n\nNFL.com placed him among the top rookies of the 2025 class, and coaches have repeatedly called him a foundational piece in the middle of the Cowboys’ line. When you put it all together – league-leading pass-pro volume for a rookie, solid run-blocking and resilience coming back from a high-ankle sprain – the story of his season is simple to tell. Booker didn’t just survive his rookie year, he nailed it and played like the long-term starting guard Dallas hoped they were getting, with only polish and discipline standing between him and a genuine Pro Bowl conversation in 2026.",

    "title": "Scouting New York Jets cornerback Samuel Womack III",
    "description": "Taking a look at a Jets cornerback",
    "fullText": "Over the next few months, we’ll be taking an in-depth look at some of the late season signings who are under contract for 2026, and futures signings after the end of the season. We continue today with cornerback Samuel Womack, who signed a futures deal on the day after the season ended, having been elevated from the practice squad to start the season finale.\n\nThe 26-year old Womack is listed at 5’10” and 189 pounds and was a fifth round pick out of Toledo in 2022. He has started 11 games in his career so far, including eight with the Colts in 2024, and has racked up 73 tackles, 13 pass breakups and three interceptions in 46 career games.\n\nWomack was a productive receiver and cornerback in high school but wasn’t ranked by any of the main outlets so he had to walk on at Toledo. However, he saw action in seven games as a true freshman and recorded four tackles and an interception.\n\nHe continued to play a rotational role in 2018 but did make his first career start as he had 12 tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss and a pass breakup in 13 games.\n\nOver the next three years, Womack moved into a starting role and was productive as he had 59 tackles, 15 pass breakups and two interceptions in 2019 followed by 20 tackles and eight pass breakups in just six games in 2020. He was then named as a first-team all-MAC selection in his final season in 2021 as he had 32 tackles, 18 passes defensed and two more interceptions.\n\nDespite not being invited to the scouting combine, Womack had a good pro day and was ultimately drafted by the 49ers in the fifth round.\n\nAs a rookie, Womack made one start and ended the season with 19 tackles, an interception and a forced fumble. However, his second season was disrupted by injuries and he had just seven tackles in seven games.\n\nHaving been released in final cuts by the 49ers after the 2024 preseason, he was claimed on waivers by the Colts and made a good impact with them as he had an excellent season. He started eight games and racked up 36 tackles, nine pass breakups and two interceptions.\n\nDespite this, he failed to make the roster in 2025 and ended up on the Titans for whom he made five appearances including one start. He had four tackles and a pass breakup. However, he was waived again in November and ended up on the Jets’ practice squad in December.\n\nWomack didn’t play until the season finale but was in on every snap and had seven tackles and a pass breakup in a solid performance and then signed a futures deal the next day.\n\nLet’s move onto some more in-depth analysis of what Womack brings to the table as a player, based on extensive research and film study.\n\nWomack has average size and length but posted some good numbers at his pro day where he ran a 4.40 in the 40-yard dash and managed a 36-inch vertical jump and solid agility numbers. His broad jump was below average and he did not participate in the bench press.\n\nWomack primarily played on the outside during his career, but he did see extensive action in the slot in a couple of games in his final season at Toledo and then got some work there with the 49ers in his rookie year both in preseason and the regular season. He also played there in preseason in 2024.\n\nWith the Colts and Titans, and with the Jets in the season finale, he played exclusively outside.\n\nWomack’s coverage numbers in college were excellent as he allowed a catch on less than half of his targets and never got beaten for more than four touchdowns in a season.\n\nAt the NFL level, he has given up nine touchdowns in his career, including six in 2024 alone. However, at some points during that season he was ranking among the league leaders in categories such as forced incompletion rate and snaps per reception allowed.\n\nHis balance, anticipation and movement skills are good and his film shows plenty of examples of being able to stay with his man.\n\nHis biggest issue seems to be inconsistent footwork, which can lead to him being beaten off the line.\n\nWhile he can run stride for stride with receivers on deep routes, he can struggle to recover when a bigger receiver gets a clean release off the line.\n\nWomack posted spectacular on-ball numbers in college. In fact, he is ranked 11th all-time in NCAA history for passes defensed despite only having three seasons (one of them pandemic-shortened) as a starter. He led the MAC three straight years in that category and twice placed in the top-four in the nation.\n\nHe showcased his timing and ability to disrupt on this play in the season finale, where he played the defender’s hands to perfection.\n\nIn terms of interceptions, which is of course something the Jets are desperate to add to their team, Womack had five in college and has three in regular season action at the NFL level. He also had two \n\nWhile run defense isn’t a major part of Womack’s game as an outside corner, it’s something he got better at over the course of his college career and it hasn’t proved to be a weakness for him at the pro level as some analysts anticipated.\n\nMissed tackles were another thing that some analysts thought might be an issue for Womack at the pro level, due to his average size and a perceived lack of play strength. This was despite the fact his tackle efficiency numbers in college weren’t too bad. Again, though, this hasn’t really been a problem in the pros, although he has had five missed tackles, all in 2024.\n\nHe had one forced fumble in his rookie season.\n\nAt times, Womack has used his hands well to jam at the line or redirect within five yards of the line of scrimmage, although this wasn’t really his primary role with the Colts or Titans.\n\nHe had 13 penalties during his college career with some analysts picking up on the fact that he would grab from time to time. However, he only has one defensive holding and one pass interference penalty at the pro level.\n\nAlthough he isn’t big, he is capable of making some aggressive tackles.\n\nWomack has hardly ever blitzed at the NFL level, although he did have a quarterback hit in a preseason game. He had this half-sack in college.\n\nWomack has had plenty of experience on all the main special teams units including as a vice on the punt return team and a gunner on punt coverage.\n\nHe wasn’t that productive in college, where he had as many penalties (three) as special teams tackles, but he has nine special teams tackles at the NFL level and made this impressive play at the goal line.\n\nHe did false start once on a punt though.\n\nWomack has displayed an ability to make quick reads and come up to make plays close to the line of scrimmage. In addition, he looks comfortable in terms of his assignment responsibilities in zone coverage.\n\nAs a former walk-on, Womack has displayed determination to get to this level and has been similarly defiant when released by the 49ers, Colts and Titans. He believes he deserves more of a chance to show what he can do and brings good energy and communication skills.\n\nOn-field discipline hasn’t been an issue with just three defensive penalties at the NFL level, although one was for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nWomack spent five weeks on injured reserve in 2023, then returned in November, after suffering an MCL sprain in his knee. Otherwise, he has only been affected by minor injuries and illness during his career so far.\n\nIt was surprising to see Womack unable to make the Colts roster this year after a strong 2024 season, but he reportedly really struggled in Lou Anarumo’s new system.\n\nThat scheme sees the Colts mix up their coverages and packages a lot more than in the past and Womack apparently struggled in camp with giving up catches and penalties.\n\nHe perhaps looked at his most confident when playing in the Colts’ zone heavy schemes but he has handled man and press assignments in the past so it may have been the multiple nature of the system that he struggled to get to grips with.\n\nHe was a teammate of current Jets wide receiver Adonai Mitchell with the Colts.\n\nWomack’s performance in the season finale stood out as a rare bright spot for the Jets that day, and going back over his career so far suggests that he has some ability and potential that could give him a realistic shot at a roster spot with the Jets next season.\n\nAaron Glenn has brought in a series of defensive backs that he says fits what the Jets do and Womack slotted right into the lineup and did a solid job which sets him up well to perform at training camp next season.\n\nOf course, we don’t know who the new defensive coordinator is going to be and, judging by what happened in Indianapolis, there’s a chance Womack might not fit in as well after this change is made. However, based on his talent alone, it’s too soon to write off Womack as a replacement level player and the Jets may have made a shrewd acquisition of an overlooked cornerback who could prove useful.",

    "fullText": "Joao Pedro’s window at Chelsea is closing, and the next few games will tell us a lot about his short term future.\n\nHe came in with a big impact at the Club World Cup, and gave everyone the hope that Chelsea’s striker troubles were over. But as time has passed, it’s become clear that he prefers to play as a number ten.\n\nThat’s all well and good. The problem is that Chelsea already have plenty of number tens. There’s an argument they have too many, even without the Brazil star. Meanwhile, they’re pretty short up front.\n\nLiam Delap has missed most of the season injured, and has only just scored his first Premier League goal a week ago. Yet as far as we can see, he’s ahead of JP in the pecking order for Liam Rosenior. Delap may not score, but he puts himself about. That’s more than you can say for Joao Pedro at the moment.\n\nJoao Pedro protests a decision against Arsenal. (Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images)\n\nWith Enzo Fernandez, Andrey Santos, Cole Palmer and even Estevao Willian pushing for minutes at 10, and Delap a better option up top, JP is looking a little lost right now. Rotation and injuries will always mean he’s in line for fairly regular action, especially off the bench where he provides a good option.\n\nBut right now, it’s hard to imagine him being considered first choice. He’s got 18 Premier League starts and 3 sub appearances, so he’s featured in every game so far this season. We doubt that record is going to continue.\n\nWest Ham are circling around the drain of the Premier League, and are getting desperate for solutions. They’re now sniffing around a player who Chelsea don’t even use.\n\nCole Palmer had his annus mirabilis under Mauricio Pochettino rather than Enzo Maresca and the stats show it clearly – but how much of that was actually down to the coaches?",

    "description": "The Tennessee Titans interviewed Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator and former Rams coach Steve Spagnuolo for their open head coach position.",
    "fullText": "The Tennessee Titans conducted an interview with Steve Spagnuolo for their head coaching vacancy. Here's everything you need to know about the Titans' coaching candidate.\n\nSpagnuolo, 66, has been the Kansas City Chiefs’ defensive coordinator since 2019 and is a four-time Super Bowl champion as a coordinator. He previously served as head coach of the St. Louis Rams from 2009-11 and spent four games as interim head coach with the New York Giants in 2017. Across those four seasons, Spagnuolo posted an 11-41 record. Among coaches who’ve coached at least 50 games in the Super Bowl era, Spagnuolo’s winning percentage is the second worst, ahead of only Hue Jackson.\n\nSpagnuolo has worked with Chiefs coach Andy Reid during Reid’s tenures in Philadelphia and Kansas City. He also worked with Tom Coughlin in New York as the Giants’ defensive coordinator in 2007-08, helping the Giants to a Super Bowl win, before heading to St. Louis for his first head coaching job.\n\nSpagnuolo’s tenure in St. Louis was one of the more disastrous runs for any franchise in recent memory. The Rams went 1-15 in Spagnuolo’s first season, earning the No. 1 pick in the ensuing No. 1 draft that was used on quarterback Sam Bradford. Bradford helped turn things around for the Rams as a rookie, posting a 7-9 record. But the Rams’ fates cratered the next year. Bradford and the offense only scored 193 points all season, the fifth-worst mark of the 21st century and, to this day, the last time an NFL team scored fewer than 200 points across a full season. Spagnuolo’s defense didn’t fare all that much better, allowing the seventh-most points in the NFL and putting up a putrid performance against the run to push the squad to a 2-14 finish and Spagnuolo to his firing.\n\nSpagnuolo bounced around roles with New Orleans, Baltimore and the Giants over the next half-decade before returning to Reid’s orbit at the start of the Chiefs’ dynasty. Under Spagnuolo’s tutelage, Chiefs defenders like Chris Jones, Tyrann Mathieu and Trent McDuffie have earned first-team All-Pro nods, while contributors such as Nick Bolton, Frank Clark and Justin Reid playing at or around the peaks of their positions at various times.\n\nThough Reid’s offense gets a lot of credit for the Chiefs’ Super Bowl wins, Spagnuolo’s defense has been the propulsive force of their last couple of runs. This was especially true in 2023 when the Chiefs owned the NFL’s No. 2 scoring defense and total defense versus ranking No. 9 in total offense and No. 15 in scoring offense.\n\nSpagnuolo worked in Kansas City with Titans GM Mike Borgonzi from 2019-2024, lending some familiarity to the interview process.\n\nThe Titans fired former coach Brian Callahan in October after a 1-5 start to the 2025 season that followed a 3-14 debut year in 2024. Under interim coach Mike McCoy, the Titans finished the 2025 season with another 3-14 record and earned the No. 4 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThe Titans have announced completed head coach interviews with the following candidates:\n\nKevin Stefanski, former Browns HC\n\nJason Garrett, former Cowboys HC\n\nThe Titans have also scheduled interviews with or requested interviews from the following candidates: Former Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy, Los Angeles Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter, Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, former Atlanta Falcons coach Raheem Morris, former Miami Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel, Pittsburgh Steelers offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley and San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh.\n\nNick Suss is the Titans beat writer for The Tennessean.

    "description": "Lawrence \"Larry\" Layne provided UCLA with a final gift after his death in December, donating $17.3 million to the football and men's basketball teams.",
    "fullText": "Bob Chesney and Mick Cronin have a new major ally in their bid to compete in the Big Ten.\n\nA $17.3-million gift from late alumnus and longtime donor Lawrence “Larry” Layne will benefit the UCLA football and men’s basketball programs, giving them essential financial resources as they try to keep up with their cash-infused conference counterparts.\n\nThe football team will receive $9.6 million and the men’s basketball program $7.7 million as part of Layne’s more than $40-million pledge to various university programs. The donation to the athletic department is believed to be the biggest in more than a decade.\n\n“I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude for Larry’s longstanding history of generosity to both campus and the athletic department, including this transformational gift,” UCLA athletic director Martin Jarmond said in a statement. “I am fortunate to have spent time with Larry and get to know his deep passion for UCLA Athletics, particularly his desire to help our football and men’s basketball programs thrive in this new era of collegiate sports. His investment in our programs positions us, and future generations of Bruin athletes, for long-term success.”\n\nA former men’s rugby player and women’s rugby coach at UCLA, Layne received his master’s of business administration from the school in 1977 and went on to found Nova Storage. He was a fan of multiple Bruins sports and a donor for six decades, his generosity extending beyond his passing in December 2024 at 75.\n\nLayne has supported UCLA athletics since giving to the women’s rugby club in 1979 and becoming the team's first coach. He also supported the renovation of Pauley Pavilion and the construction of the Wasserman Football Center. Over the years, he’s also given to UCLA baseball, softball, women’s tennis and men’s water polo, his gifts totaling $18.8 million, including his latest donation.\n\n“As a former UCLA student-athlete and coach, Larry fully understood the hard work and determination that was needed to be at his best both on and off the field,” Chesney said, “and this incredibly generous gift will make a big impact on helping us build a championship football team. I am very grateful to Larry and his wife Sheelagh for their support of UCLA and our football program. We will make sure that Larry’s legacy lives on by continuing to support our student-athletes and upholding our university’s True Bruin values.”\n\nLayne’s gift also includes $11.4 million to UCLA Health, assisting research in cardiology and hepatology; $5.7 million to the UCLA Anderson School of Management to support entrepreneurial and real estate studies; $3.8 million to men’s rugby; and $1.9 million to UCLA’s Center for the Art of Performance.\n\nCronin, who has spoken about wanting to be the moneyed Dodgers of college basketball instead of the cash-strapped Cincinnati Reds, will now be closer to reaching that status thanks to this gift.\n\n“I would like to thank Larry for his generosity and long-time support of our athletics department, specifically toward our men’s basketball program,” Cronin said. “This university has so many fantastic resources for its student-athletes, but we simply would not be able to thrive if not for the generosity of our many loyal donors such as Larry. His generous gift will help us in the future as we continue to build a basketball program with elite young men who all of our fans can be proud to support.”\n\nA graduate of Sylmar High, where he was captain of the football team, Layne later raised money to install lights for the school’s football field and went on to attend Occidental College before going to UCLA for graduate school. His lifelong love of rugby took him to London to play for the Harlequins, and his Los Angeles team was known as the Flying Pumpkins.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "title": "Former NBA veteran gives caution to Fred Warner returning from his ankle injury",
    "description": "There is a counterargument to 49ers LB Fred Warner returning for the playoffs",
    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers have floated around the NFC Championship as a potential game for linebacker Fred Warner to return. Warner has not appeared in a game since October 12, when he dislocated his ankle in Week 6.\n\nAfter Sunday’s game, 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan said the chances are “Not very high” of Warner playing in the Divisional Round. The team playing on a short week could certainly influence Shanahan’s decision.\n\nWarner has different ideas. He uploaded a video of himself doing drills on Monday:\n\n.@fred_warner showing his recovery progress 👀\n\n(via @fred_warner) pic.twitter.com/X94flz0i1l\n\nOn The Ryen Russillo Show, before Wild Card weekend, Warner said:\n\n“I’m ready whenever they’re ready. There’s some T’s that gotta be crossed, I’s that gotta be dotted. Unfortunately, if it were just up to me, I’d be out there this weekend, but it’s unfortunately not that way. I’ve got to make sure I’m checking all the boxes, and everybody has to give me the okay before they let me go out there. But I’m pushing, man. I’m training hard. I’m back doing full football drills and everything, so time will tell. We gotta pull the win off first.”\n\nThis could also be a scenario where the team is protecting Warner from himself. In his mind, he was probably ready to play in Week 17. But, as he said, every box needs to be checked. While the team would love to have Warner on the field in the Divisional Round, the last thing they want to do is sacrifice the longevity of his career.\n\nFormer NBA all-star Michael Redd, who played from 2000 to 2012, shared his thoughts on the topic:\n\nLooks like a near-miraculous comeback. Near, but not totally. Here’s my OG advice no one asked for: We’ve seen this play out before. Could name countless examples, but let’s go…Brandon Roy came back in 8 days from meniscus surgery in 2010. Retired at 27 with no cartilage left. Robert Williams rushed back for the Celtics playoff series in 2022, still dealing with it, seems like. KD tore his Achilles coming back too early in 2019, back but missed ton of time. Look, injuries robbed me of the back half of my career too, so I get wanting to be out there…especially for the playoffs. But take your time. Come back 100%. You’re not the difference between winning a title or not. And if you are? You’ll be that guy next year too. Your body is your career. Have to protect it. Fans will understand and appreciate the extra good years that you/they get out of it!\n\nWarner was in the conversation for Defensive Player of the Year before sustaining an ankle injury, so there’s a strong argument that he could be the difference in winning a title or not. But that doesn’t make Redd’s point moot.\n\nWarner is under contract for four more seasons. There are no guarantees the 49ers will be back in the playoffs, but this is a team that has proven to be a consistent postseason contender. Big picture, you want Warner on the field for the duration of the decade, not the 2025 regular season.\n\nRE: Fred Warner and a potential return to #49ers. This Sunday would mark 21 days until the Super Bowl. Opening his practice window at any point from then would give maximum time possible to evaluate if he's ready to go with no real down side. \n\n(That's probably true now, too,…\n\n— Nick Wagoner (@nwagoner) January 13, 2026\n\nAs Nick Wagoner stated above, the 49ers could open Warner’s practice window this week.",

    "fullText": "Super Bowl LII MVP Nick Foles had also seen enough of the Eagles’ underperforming offense.\n\n“Frustrated” watching elite talent fail to produce, he believes the Eagles, whose season ended in the wild-card round of the playoffs, realized their offense was broken much earlier than they let on.\n\nOn “The SZN with Nick Foles and Evan Moore” podcast, Foles said the Eagles are ready to replace first-year offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo.\n\n“I’m telling you, they’ve already got a plan in place,” Foles said. “They’re not just caught off guard by this. They’ve had all season to prepare. I think at the halfway mark, we knew what was going to happen, but Eagles fans and football fans were thinking like, ‘Hey, maybe they’ll figure it out.’ They never did. But I guarantee you, behind closed walls in a secret little dungeon, someone was researching who the next OC of the Philadelphia Eagles will be.”\n\nFoles believes the Eagles have been studying former head coaches Mike McDaniel (Miami Dolphins) and Brian Daboll (New York Giants) to gauge whether their styles would fit the Eagles’ personnel.\n\nFoles agreed with how a previous guest, former NFL cornerback and Amazon NFL analyst Richard Sherman, described the Eagles’ offense.\n\n“I thought he explained it perfectly with his illustration,” Foles said. “It’s like you have a Ferrari and you put a Toyota Corolla engine in it and you have all the pieces. It looks like a Ferrari, but it just doesn’t run and sound like a Ferrari. I was hoping that the Eagles did that this year with the offense because they have the parts. It looks like a Ferrari. It ran like a Ferrari last year. All these parts and the engine’s a little different. It was the same old story, which is frustrating.”\n\nDespite big names such as quarterback Jalen Hurts, running back Saquon Barkley, wide receivers A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith and tight end Dallas Goedert, the unit finished the regular season ranked 24th in total offense (311.2 yards per game), 23rd in passing offense (194.3 yards per game) and 18th in rushing offense (116.9 yards per game).\n\nThe Eagles know where they’ll be picking in the first round of the 2026 NFL draft\n\nEagles star Saquon Barkley after disappointing season: ‘I let my teammates down’\n\nCould Brian Daboll fix Eagles? 10 candidates for OC job if Kevin Patullo is fired\n\nWill Eagles star Lane Johnson return for 2026 season? ‘Whatever happens, happens’",

    "fullText": "AS Monaco are pleased to announce the arrival of Wout Faes. The 27-year-old Belgian international centre-back has joined the club on loan from Leicester City Football Club until the end of the season, with an option to buy.\n\nAfter spells in the Belgian and English leagues, notably in the Premier League, Belgian international Wout Faes, with 28 caps, is set to make his return to Ligue 1 with AS Monaco, a championship he knows well, having previously played there with Stade de Reims from 2020 to 2022.\n\nBorn in Mol, Belgium, on 3 April 1998, Wout Faes completed his youth development in his home country. He began at KVV Rauw Sport Mol (2003–2006), before continuing at Lierse SK (2006–2012), and then at RSC Anderlecht, where he signed his first professional contract in 2016.\n\nThe following year, he made his professional debut with SC Heerenveen in the Netherlands, before joining Excelsior Rotterdam for the 2017–2018 season, during which he made 20 appearances. He then moved to KV Ostende (Belgian First Division), where he played 64 matches and scored two goals between 2018 and 2020.\n\nIn the summer of 2020, Wout Faes joined France and Stade de Reims. Wearing the “Rémois” shirt, he established himself as a key figure in defence, making 77 appearances in all competitions and scoring five goals. Since the summer of 2022, Wout Faes has been playing for Leicester City. With the “Foxes”, the 1.87 m centre-back discovered the Premier League (65 matches, 2 goals, 2 assists) and the Championship (58 matches, 3 goals, 1 assist).\n\nHis performances earned him a place in the Belgian national team. Having represented his country at all youth levels, he now has 28 caps for “les Diables Rouges” and took part in the 2022 World Cup as well as UEFA Euro 2024.\n\nWout Faes will now be playing under the colours of AS Monaco with the number 25.",

    "title": "The pros and cons of NASCAR's new championship format for 2026",
    "description": "Fans and drivers alike are applauding NASCAR for moving away from the elimination-style format that has been part of the Cup Series for over a decade",
    "fullText": "NASCAR has a new championship format for 2026, and the overwhelming reaction has been positive. But what exactly has changed with this latest iteration and why is it such a good thing? Let's take a look:\n\nLooking over the format, it is much better in regards to rewarding the best driver during each particular season. The eliminations and multiple rounds/resets are completely gone, replaced by a single reset after Race #26. The 16 title finalists will then have ten races to execute better than their rivals and accumulate the most points en route to earning the title.\n\nThis is a huge bonus. Between 2014 and 2025, drivers had to jump through hoops, surviving chaotic three-race rounds only to compete in a one-race showdown with four drivers tied on points. Naturally, the driver who dominated the year often failed to win the crown, drawing the ire of NASCAR fans. Even when they were 100% deserving, it somehow felt wrong. Last year, Kyle Larson scored more points than most of the field over the final ten races, and yet his title felt cheap to some due to the circumstances of that final race.\n\nBut what about the 2026 reset? It's not based on bonus points gathered throughout the year, and it's fairly simple. Whoever is leading the standings at the end of the regular season will be granted 2100 points. The driver in second will have 2075, third will have 2065, and then it drops five points per position until the last driver to make it into the postseason has 2000, and is 100 points behind the leader. This is a good way to reward the most consistent drivers over the entire year and about as close as the sport has gotten to a full-season format since 2003. It's also very simple which is a bonus, as the complexity of previous formats has been a key criticism.\n\nThis 'new' format is basically The Chase, so it makes since that NASCAR has resurrected the term. The Chase resulted in some incredible battles, like the 2011 season when Carl Edwards and Tony Stewart tied for the championship after finishing 1-2 in the finale. Game 7 moments weren't manufactured like with the eliminations, and they felt more real.\n\nHowever, the original version of The Chase also featured the most dominant run in NASCAR history as Jimmie Johnson won five consecutive titles from 2006 through 2010. But with the modern car and how close the field is, I don't think we will ever see a runaway performance like that again.\n\nAnother positive change was putting more incentive on race wins without making it all about the playoffs. No longer will we hear 'X driver wins the Daytona 500 -- and they're in the playoffs!' A win does not guarantee you a spot, so the driver 34th in points who wins a race can't supplant the winless driver sitting seventh in the overall standings. Instead, NASCAR has increased the points haul for race wins from 40 points to 55. Second-place rewards 35 points, so there is a massive 20-point gap between race wins and runner-up finishes.\n\nNot only will that incentivize drivers tempted to 'points race' to race harder for that extra spot, but it really rewards those collecting the most checkered flags. If a driver like Shane van Gisbergen goes out and wins another four road courses, he won't automatically earn a spot in The Chase, but that's a lot of extra points that will help him in reaching 16th. No longer can a driver rely solely on winning, as it is now part of a bigger picture. And in the postseason itself, those wins are going to be incredibly valuable as the gap between first and second in the running order is now the same as the gap between second and 22nd.\n\nOkay, so this all sounds great, but the title of this story is pros AND cons, so what are the negatives? Thankfully, there aren't many unless you were a proponent for the full-season points or bust crowd. A glaring problem to me is the number of drivers taking part in the 2026 version of The Chase. 16 drivers is a lot, and carving a few off would have been better. However, it's understandable why NASCAR's hands were a bit tied here with the chartered teams and their sponsors not wanting to limit the opportunity to be part of The Chase. There will be a smaller field for the lower divisions as 12 drivers make The Chase in the O'Reilly Auto Parts Series and ten for the Truck Series.\n\nStages remain, as do the points they offer, and that's not something I'm excited about either. Ignoring the fact that we're still artificially breaking up races, those stage points, especially during The Chase, will be like gold. Yes, it will push drivers to race harder for them which could be a good thing, but it also feels like it will have too much of an influence on the final standings with the way this new format is structured. There are up to 20 points on offer through stages alone, and a driver finishing deep in the field could match the points scored by someone placing 20 positions higher, and that seems wrong.\n\nDespite those minor gripes, the majority of these changes are fantastic for adding legitimacy back to the NASCAR championship, and calming frustrations born from recent years. Last year, we were all holding our breath hoping the 'right' driver prevailed throughout championship weekend, and that's not how a champion should be decided. There could be a surprise with this format with drivers getting hot at the right time, but certainly no flukes. Winning will matter quite a bit, but consistency and performance over the entire season will be paramount, as it should be.\n\nNASCAR drivers, legends say new format is about legitimacy\n\nThe evolution of NASCAR's championship format over the years\n\nNASCAR reverts to the Chase for the Championship format in 2026\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "After a long stretch without much presence, France is back in the Formula 1 mix, with three drivers set to be in the spotlight come 2026.\n\nIsack Hadjar might be the most intriguing of the bunch. He’s just stepped into a big role at Red Bull, teaming up with Max Verstappen.\n\nHe spent only one season getting his bearings at Racing Bulls before being called up for another new start under the upcoming regulations.\n\nNobody’s tipping him for a title push just yet. But if he settles in quickly, there’s every chance he could grab a win or two along the way.\n\nReflecting on his first year in F1, Hadjar spoke about how often he found himself on track with Lewis Hamilton and what that meant to him personally.\n\n“I didn’t expect to be so close so early. I had lots of battles with him,” said Hadjar. “I didn’t expect it to happen so quickly because I was expecting him to run away from me.”\n\n“He was maybe not as competitive as in previous years, but it was still crazy for me because I always looked up to him as an idol and shared track space with him.”\n\nLooking ahead, Hadjar sees his partnership with Verstappen as a big opportunity for growth. It’s something he believes will make him stronger behind the wheel.\n\nHadjar’s promotion to Red Bull came with plenty of advice from Helmut Marko, who was clear that results wouldn’t come right away. The message: don’t expect immediate wins. Settling in and finding his feet will be a process. Verstappen’s experience gives him the early edge, but that gap should close as Hadjar adapts.\n\nHe was recently asked on the Talking Bull podcast which past driver he’d choose as an ideal teammate. Despite his French background, his choice wasn’t what many might have expected.\n\n“I’m still going for Lewis [Hamilton]. Ayrton [Senna, if they’re not on the grid],” Hadjar said.\n\n“Unreal. Legend [Prost]. Because again, huge Senna fan, and as a kid, I was rooting for Ayrton, and as I grew up, more and more appreciating what Prost did, actually,” Hadjar said.\n\n“You actually look at his career; he has had the most beautiful career in terms of stats and teams he has joined. He has won with all the great teams; he had all the toughest teammates.”\n\nHadjar still has areas to work on after just one season in Formula 1. There’s room to grow before he’s considered a complete driver – but learning from someone like Prost could only help.\n\nTed Kravitz has openly admitted he’s worried about how Hadjar will handle being paired with one of the sport’s all-time greats.\n\nVerstappen’s relentless drive has worn down plenty of teammates before, but Hadjar seems to have a solid support system in place to help him through it.\n\nOff the circuit, life doesn’t seem too bad for Hadjar. In 2025, he shared a special moment with his father that will stick with him for a long time.\n\n“My dad is a physicist, and he always wanted to meet Alain Prost because he’s the only like driver [with the nickname professor]. He was here when I gave him my helmet,” said Hadjar.\n\n“Actually, the best moment was seeing my dad, who actually watched Prost live racing. He got to spend a bit of time with him, and I was so hyped for my dad, it was the best moment.”\n\nMax Verstappen shares advice on breaking into F1 that most young drivers ignore\n\nRed Bull to focus on one upgrade to help Max Verstappen in 2026 F1 season\n\nMax Verstappen explains why he’s exactly the same as F1 legend Michael Schumacher on track",

    "fullText": "The Chicago Cubs have Alex Bregman. Alex Bregman has 175 million bucks. And what do the Boston Red Sox have? A mountain of regret, a gargantuan leadership void and a whole lot of explaining to do.\n\nBregman’s $175 million deal with the Cubs, first reported by Michael Cerami of Bleacher Nation, will run for five years and features $70 million worth of deferred money. Notably, it includes a full no-trade clause but not opt-outs. That means Bregman, 32 years old in March, will be a Cub for at least the next half-decade.\n\nIt’s a significant investment for a player of that age, particularly one with recurring lower-body issues, but Bregman’s consistent offensive game, reliable third base glove and needle-moving clubhouse persona elevate the Cubs into a legitimate World Series contender. He makes Chicago a better baseball team moving forward; let’s gripe about “value” some other time.\n\nFor the Red Sox, who signed the longtime Houston Astro on an opt-out laden short-term pact last winter, this outcome is nothing short of an utter catastrophe. Bregman’s exit from Fenway Park represents a most embarrassing culmination to a most tumultuous year. Boston’s shocking decision to trade away franchise cornerstone Rafael Devers this past June was directly tied to Bregman’s presence at the hot corner.\n\nHad team owner John Henry and chief baseball officer Craig Breslow committed to Bregman long-term, then offloading Devers would have made some sense. Bregman’s one season at Fenway was an overwhelming success despite a two-month IL stint. Before the injury, he was tracking like a top-10 MVP candidate. The club’s gaggle of young players spoke endlessly about Bregman’s leadership qualities. His steadiness helped Boston overcome a drama-filled campaign to reach the playoffs, where the team was a win away from knocking off the Yankees.\n\n[Get more Red Sox news: Boston team feed]\n\nLittle of that matters now. The Red Sox, with their unwavering fealty to reason, didn’t want to pony up. They are left with a rightfully enraged fan base, one left perplexed at how neither Devers nor Bregman are still around. Breslow attempted to placate the Red Sox faithful via an email Q&A with Mass Live’s Chris Cotillo on Sunday, but the executive’s jargony, calculated answers only reinforced the criticism that he runs the club with a ruthless, robotic, un-human efficiency.\n\nBut even the toxically-optimistic, long-viewed Breslow readily admitted that the outcome of the Bregman-Devers saga was suboptimal.\n\nHe typed out to Cotillo: “Neither outcome we face right now is ideal, but both will be evaluated over a longer time horizon.”\n\nThe rest of the interview is mostly hollow GM-speak, but there are also moments of unintentional honesty that amplify concerns about Breslow’s way of doing business. In regards to what motivated Bregman to choose Chicago’s offer, Boston’s top baseball exec expressed that “It would be foolish and unfair for me to guess what was most important in their decision making.”\n\nOne might argue that rather than being “foolish and unfair” it would be prudent and essential to understand the factors influencing Bregman’s “decision making.” Being unwilling to include a no-trade clause in the contract, for instance, seems to have been a major sticking point for Bregman and his agent Scott Boras. After two straight winters wading through free agency’s messy waters, Bregman wanted stability. He wanted somewhere he could put down roots for his family, buy a house, be a part of a community as he was in Houston. Everybody in New England knew as much.\n\nBregman’s desire for a no-trade clause was even more reasonable given the shadow of Devers’ departure only seven months prior. If the Sox were willing to change course and send somebody of Devers’ stature out of town, why would they hesitate to do the same to Bregman? Via additional Mass Live reporting, the team pointed to “organizational policy” in regards to their refusal to grant Bregman a no-trade. But in the end, that calculating inflexibility proved to be a miscalculation.\n\nThe whole thing is a public-relations disasterclass, a textbook example of how to not interface with your fan base. Whether the Red Sox don’t know this or simply don’t care is unclear. The majesty of Fenway Park (and the surrounding real-estate holdings) ensure that the team will print money whether or not the on-field product succeeds. It’s a savvy way for Fenway Sports Group to operate. It’s also cutthroat, insulting and short-sighted.\n\nAnd in the end, all will be well if the team wins. The 2026 Red Sox remain a talented bunch. Garrett Crochet is a top-four pitcher on Earth. Roman Anthony is a volcano of talent. The additions of Sonny Gray and Willson Contreras are legitimately impactful. Positionally, the roster is a puzzle of border pieces, a disjointed assortment of good players that a trade or two could help simplify.\n\nStill, Boston could overcome that dynamic to win 95 games and make a deep October run. If that happens, fans will pack Fenway to the gills and champion Breslow’s commitment to the process. Success, as always, heals everything.\n\nBut with Bregman out the door, it’s hard to say the Red Sox are better right now than they were a few months ago, when their season ended in pinstriped disappointment. It’s a reality that might have been avoided, whether with a couple more millions or a couple more human conversations.\n\nEither way, the result is the same: Red Sox leadership looks bad, with a long to-do list that includes explaining how this happened to an irate fan base.",

For comparison, Yamaha’s factory team ended the season sixth in the standings with 269 points, but the majority of which were scored by 2021 champion Fabio Quartararo.\n\nAlthough Pramac and Yamaha held a joint launch event in 2025, the two teams are staging separate presentations this year.

    "fullText": "Las week started with the Las Vegas Raiders firing Pete Carroll as head coach so let’s end the week by getting onto some points made by general manager Jon Spytek that show this was doomed from the start.\n\nCarroll and Spytek was essentially an arranged marriage and those pairing rarely work in the NFL.\n\nSpytek was hired just before Carroll, so, while he clearly had the chance to be on board with the hire, he also didn’t have much time to play a major role in the hiring decision.\n\nIt’s was clunky hiring decision to begun with Tom Brady was focused on Ben Johnson, who truly was always focused on joining the Chciaogo Bears. Tom Telesco was fired as general manager to help attract the coaching job to the likes of Johnson. It didn’t help.\n\nBrady turned to Spytek, his college buddy and then they settled on Carroll. Both Carroll and Spytek went out of their way to say how their partnership would work and that held that mantra for months.\n\nLate in the season, however, Carroll, basically admitted here was a disconnected between him and Spytek.\n\nIt was evident as Carroll wanted to win now (as the oldest head coach in NFL history) and Spytek’s moves in free agency was more geared to setting the roster up for the future. There was also a disconnect on how Carrol used the rookie class for much of the season.\n\nThis week, Spytek said it will be important for the new coach to be prepare to “climb a big mountain” that will not take a day to achieve. he also noted he wants the new head-coach to have power of his staff.\n\nThat lent credence to reports that Chip Kelly was forced onto Carroll by part owner Tom Brady, who will lead this interview cycle with Spytek.\n\nThere was just so many things that points that this was it a great pairing last year and in the end, the Raiders are hitting the reset button once again, hiring a new coach for the fourth time since 2022.\n\nIf happens again in the new future, Spytek likely won’t be around to discuss it.",

His 96.8 mph average fastball velocity and high sinker usage help generate a lot of ground balls, which should be of interest to the Diamondbacks.\n\nIf Loaisiga can remain healthy, there's no reason Arizona should not at least give him a chance as a middle reliever, given his past success with the Yankees.\n\nTeam USA's projected WBC lineup is incredible\n\nDominican Republic's projected WBC lineup is fierce\n\nHow Tigers, Tarik Skubal have reached a record-setting contract conflict\n\nPhillies have a secret weapon for signing Bo Bichette\n\nMLB looking at realignment into East-West arrangement\n\nHunter Pence's nephew has the best name and a 100 MPH fastball",

    "fullText": "Juventus are still targeting a deal for Federico Chiesa in the January transfer window, and recent reports suggest that they are beginning to come round to the idea of bringing the 28-year-old back on a permanent basis. Here’s a look at how the Bianconeri plan to finance the deal.\n\nJuventus sold Chiesa to Liverpool for a fee in the region of €15m just 18 months ago. The former Fiorentina man had effectively been pushed out of the Bianconeri first-team with less than a year remaining on his contract at the time.\n\nDue to high salary demands and a troubling injury record, an agreement over a new deal was not found and the Italian was allowed to move on in a cut-price deal.\n\nNow, Juventus are keen to bring Chiesa back to Turin to bolster Luciano Spalletti’s attacking options. Liverpool, meanwhile, could be prepared to let Chiesa leave, but are said to only be interested in a permanent sale rather than a loan deal with an option to buy.\n\nNEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, ENGLAND – AUGUST 25: Federico Chiesa of Liverpool during the Premier League match between Newcastle United and Liverpool at St James’ Park on August 25, 2025 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. (Photo by George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nReports this week claim that Juventus are now willing to offer Liverpool a loan deal with an obligation to buy. This is expected to cost Juve somewhere in the region of €15m between the loan fee and buy option.\n\nIn order for this to happen, however, Juventus will need to shuffle a few things around in their current first-team set-up.\n\nReports from Calciomercato.com claim that the Old Lady are hoping to offload Joao Mario this month. The Portuguese full-back reportedly has interest from Crystal Palace, and from a number of unspecified Portuguese sides.\n\nGENOA, ITALY – AUGUST 31: João Mario of Juventus looks on during the Serie A match between Genoa CFC and Juventus FC at Luigi Ferraris Stadium on August 31, 2025 in Genoa, Italy. (Photo by Simone Arveda/Getty Images)\n\nJuve are also considering the possibility of sending Vasilije Adzic out on loan, which could potentially come with a loan fee that could then be put towards Chiesa.\n\nThere has also been interest in centre-back Federico Gatti this month, however, Monday’s reports indicate that the Italy international is keen to stay put at the Allianz Stadium.",

    "fullText": "Anthony Davis is likely to miss several months after undergoing surgery to repair ligament damage in his left hand, according to ESPN's Shams Charania.\n\nDavis has been considered a top trade target for a while now, although his latest setback could affect his value. Last season, he was part of one of the league's most shocking deals ever when the Los Angeles Lakers shipped him to Dallas as part of a three-team trade that delivered five-time All-NBA first-team guard Luka Dončić to L.A.\n\nWhile Dončić has become the face of the franchise Davis won a championship with during the 2020 season, Davis has had a turbulent experience with the Mavericks.\n\nThe big man has appeared in just 29 regular-season games, as well as two play-in games, since infamous Dallas general manager Nico Harrison acquired him last February.\n\nFollowing the trade, the former No. 1 overall pick was healing up from an abdominal injury. He hurried back and instantly starred with a dominant first half on Feb. 8 against the Houston Rockets, but an adductor strain related to the injury he was recovering from spoiled his night.\n\nHe missed the next six weeks of action.\n\nThen, during an April 2 game versus the Atlanta Hawks, Mavericks teammate Daniel Gafford accidentally elbowed Davis in his right eye. The injury ultimately required offseason surgery to repair a detached retina, and now Davis wears protective eyewear on the floor.\n\nFive games into this season, on Oct. 29 versus the Indiana Pacers, Davis suffered a left calf strain that kept him out 14 games after Mavericks owner Patrick Dumont reportedly delayed green-lighting the Kentucky product's return until the team had medical data indicating Davis wasn't at risk of aggravating the injury. Along the way, Harrison was fired.\n\nDavis came back in late November, only to then exit the Mavs' Christmas Day game against the Golden State Warriors with right groin spasms.\n\nDavis was back in the lineup on New Year's Day, however, but he picked up his hand injury a week later while defending Jazz forward Lauri Markkanen on a baseline drive Thursday.\n\nInjuries have been a thorn in Davis' side throughout his career, which started with New Orleans in 2012, continued in Los Angeles and has practically gone dormant in Dallas.\n\nDavis is due $58.5 million next season, per ESPN, which reported that he has a player option for $62.8 million in 2027-28.",

He said he also flips his phone over so he isn't tempted by it.\n\n\"I don't want to see my phone,\" Harris said.\n\nWhile the CTO said he normally keeps his notifications on, he doesn't \"jump straight\" to addressing every individual message he receives, given he works in an \"interrupt-driven\" environment.\n\n\"We all need to find a way to concentrate,\" he said.\n\nThe CTO said that when he's doing deep work, he'll go into a specific channel or company planning document and \"immerse\" himself in that. He said he's able to focus when he intentionally sets aside that time to work on a specific task.\n\n\"Unless there's some fire coming at me, like Slack has some issue, or Marc Benioff wants to talk to me,\" Harris said, adding that in those situations, \"I'll drop what I'm doing.\"\n\nThe company is rolling out a new AI version of its Slackbot tool on Tuesday. The CTO said the hope is that it will help users determine the most important task at any given moment.\n\nSlackbot is a personal work agent, built directly into the platform. It will now do more, including surfacing relevant context; helping track notifications; and assisting users in prioritizing Slack activity, the company said.\n\nHarris said the tool will help employees move from being \"reactive to proactive\" in the workplace.\n\n\"Slack is where work gets done. We're going to continue to tackle the productivity challenge. We want to make employees more productive,\" Harris said.\n\nHis best practices for using the new tool include being specific about context, audience, and outcome in prompts. He also suggested cross-referencing Slackbot with other data sources, providing feedback to the bot, and reviewing its output before sharing.",

    "description": "After visiting 29 states last year, I fell in love with Maine. The state's food, friendly people, and gorgeous scenery all made me feel at home.",
    "fullText": "Last year, my husband and I drove across the country, spending quality time in 29 states. Although we visited so many great destinations, if I had to pick one to move to, it would definitely be Maine.\n\nWith picturesque beach towns, lighthouses dotting the coastline, and lobster boats puttering through the harbors, Maine lived up to all my expectations of the ideal New England destination.\n\nPlus, its wooded natural preserves, delicious food, and kind people truly won me over.\n\nIf there's one thing that's synonymous with Maine, it's lighthouses. And for good reason: the state has 65 of them positioned along the coast, islands, and inlets.\n\nDuring our one-month stay in Portland, we visited six, including the West Quoddy Head Light — located on the US's easternmost peninsula — and the iconic Portland Head Light.\n\nPlus, some of the most scenic lighthouses are in the stunning Acadia National Park. While visiting, we stopped by Bass Harbor Head Light Station and hiked down to the rocks below the tower. Looking up at the beacon offered a unique vantage point I didn't experience anywhere else.\n\nAlthough the coast may get a lot of attention, Maine's inland sections offer just as many opportunities to spend time outside and explore quirky towns.\n\nFor hiking, there are countless trails and nature reserves to roam, my favorite of which was the Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens.\n\nAlthough the tree-covered trails were beautiful, our main mission was to find the massive trolls made out of recycled wood. These gentle giants made the trip to the gardens even more memorable.\n\nWe also took a trip up to Bangor, Maine, which is known for its most famous former resident: Stephen King.\n\nWe walked by his house (which is as spooky as you'd expect) and checked out the imposing water tower that is often said to be the inspiration for his novel \"It.\"\n\nIf there's one food you have to try in Maine, it's lobster — specifically, the lobster roll.\n\nFor the sake of comparison, I tried both varieties that are popular in Maine: the cold Maine-style roll (which mixes chilled lobster with mayo and celery) and the warm Connecticut-style, which tosses lobster meat in warm butter. Although the cold roll may be the more traditional style, the butter won me over.\n\nSeafood was popular across the board in Maine, but I found that my other favorite dishes were desserts. For example, the whoopie pies had the perfect level of springy sponge and decadent cream, and the potato doughnuts offered a heartier, less sweet take on the classic treat.\n\nWe also happened to be visiting during blueberry season, which runs from late July to early September. We enjoyed blueberry tarts, scones with blueberry jam, and even blueberry-infused beer served with a generous handful of the berries floating in the glass.\n\nHowever, these weren't made with the blueberries I was used to buying at the grocery store. Instead, these Maine delicacies were crafted with wild blueberries, which are about half the size and much sweeter than the \"typical\" blueberry I usually enjoy.\n\nWhether at a lobster shack along a rural highway or in one of the state's many breweries, the people we met were quite friendly and quick to strike up a conversation.\n\nLocals seemed to genuinely love living in Maine (as opposed to some states we stayed in, where residents would ask, \"Why did you choose to visit here?\")\n\nThe most palpable community spirit I experienced was at a Portland Hearts of Pine soccer game. Here, we saw folks running into neighbors and chatting with seatmates.\n\nThe energy in the crowd was contagious, and we quickly found ourselves singing along to the team chant.\n\nFrom the food to the beaches, I fell in love with everything that Maine had to offer. At the same time, I recognize that spending July in the Pine Tree State is very different from visiting in January.\n\nWould I still love Maine as much when there's snow on the ground and a frigid breeze blowing in from the Atlantic? Based on everything I experienced, I believe so.\n\nI guess I'll just have to plan another trip to find out.",

    "fullText": "I consider my mom the crème de la crème of mothers. She was the involved kind; always pulling out crafts, baking cookies, and making you feel deeply loved.\n\nBut as a grandma, she's the first to admit things haven't unfolded the way she imagined.\n\nI can't think of a time when my three kids, ages 2, 8, and 13, had my parents entirely to themselves. Sometimes my parents feel more like aunts and uncles to my kids than grandparents.\n\nI'm the oldest of eight children, five of whom were adopted. Growing up, our home was full, loud, and exciting, making one-on-one time with my parents a rare occurrence. Still, I snagged spare moments with them when I could — helping paint a room or keeping them company on an errand.\n\nThat hasn't changed much in the last three decades. While many of their empty-nest friends are traveling and downsizing, my parents are still full-time caretakers. Four of my siblings, ranging from 10 to 22, still live at home.\n\nWhen I floated the idea of a multigenerational family weekend away — timed around fall leaf peeping in Stowe, Vermont — I didn't expect much.\n\nHonestly, I asked my in-laws first. They often travel with us and have more flexibility. When they couldn't take time off work, I hesitated before calling my parents. Not because I didn't think they'd want to come, but because their schedules rarely allow for that kind of freedom.\n\n\"We'd love to!\" my mom said, to my surprise. \"Let me see if we can get a babysitter for your sister. And the boys will be fine for a weekend. I'll just make them extra meals.\"\n\nFrom the moment we boarded the plane, the trip felt special. My kids snuggled in next to their grandparents — and my daughter even willingly did her schoolwork with Nana.\n\nAs we descended, the landscape glowed orange, yellow, and red. It was postcard-perfect, but more importantly, it was free from caretaking responsibilities on their end.\n\nWe stayed at a cozy, family-friendly lodge at the base of Mount Mansfield, where the kids raided the pancake bar each morning with Papa Pat, and we admired the fall foliage from our windows and during walks along the nearby creek.\n\nThrough slow breakfasts, maple sugaring, and wandering downtown, I watched my parents finally step into the role of grandparents in a way they'd never had the space to before.\n\nAt night, we played hide and seek in our suite (my parents somehow won every round), put on puppet shows rehashing the day's events, and sat for long, savory dinners (as much as you can with a toddler).\n\nMy dairy-free dad made the mistake of trying Stowe's famous maple ice cream and spent the rest of the trip pretending to gag whenever it was mentioned. My 13-year-old son thought it was hilarious and whispered, \"maple creemie\" at him at random. My dad played along every time.\n\nMy 2-year-old learned to say \"Papa Pat,\" and my 8-year-old thought her Nana was the coolest person alive after discovering her hide-and-seek skills. The weekend was stress-free and quiet.\n\nI didn't realize how much we all needed that until we had it. My kids are more excited when they see my parents now, and for their part, my parents have promised more one on one time with my kids.\n\nThough foster care and adoption have enriched my parents' lives in countless ways, it also means they've sacrificed most of their free time. But for a few days, we were able to reclaim some of that lost time, which is what made our weekend in Stowe unforgettable.",

    "fullText": "The US ended 2025 with a lower inflation rate, but it was still far above the Federal Reserve's target.\n\nThe year-over-year inflation rate was 2.7% in December, the same as the forecast and November's increase, and down from the 2.9% a year ago.\n\nAfter most October year-over-year figures couldn't be calculated because of data collection issues during the government shutdown, the new report brings a little more clarity to how quickly prices have changed in the last few months of the year.\n\nCore CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.6% from a year ago, just below the 2.7% forecast and matching November's 2.6% increase.\n\nBoth overall and core CPI were expected to rise 0.3% over the month. Headline CPI matched that expected 0.3% increase, holding steady from September, the last month with an available change. Core CPI increased 0.2%, as it did in September.\n\n\"Economists were worried about some statistical resets after the government shutdown, but the bigger disinflation trend continued,\" David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation, said. \"Cars and energy saved the day even as shelter ticked back up.\"\n\nThe food index increased 3.1% from a year ago in December, higher than November's 2.6%. Steaks, in particular, rose 17.8% over the year, the largest since December 2021. Eggs fell 20.9% from a year ago.\n\nThere were a few record year-over-year increases. Subscription and rental of video and video games, non-electric cookware and tableware, and tenants' and household insurance had the largest increases on record. Meanwhile, moving, storage, and freight expenses fell the most year-over-year on record.\n\nLast Friday's jobs report also indicated how the economy has changed in 2025. The US added 584,000 jobs in 2025, a cooldown from job growth over the previous few years. Unemployment remained low in December but was higher than a year ago.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will be able to use these economic reports to make its interest rate decision. Economists and traders expect Federal Open Market Committee members, who will meet January 27 and January 28, to hold interest rates steady after three straight cuts before 2025 ended.\n\nCME FedWatch indicated a 95% chance after the CPI report that the Fed would hold interest rates steady.\n\nThe next few months are set to bring big changes to the Fed. Jerome Powell's term as Federal Reserve Chair ends in May, and his term on the Board of Governors ends in 2028. On Sunday, Powell said the Department of Justice served the Fed with grand jury subpoenas, which are related to testimony Powell gave last June about renovations to Fed buildings. International central bankers said they \"stand in full solidarity\" with the Fed and Powell.\n\n\"I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike,\" Powell said in a video statement. \"In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment.\"\n\nThis is a developing story.

    "description": "Injuries in Ukraine largely come from shrapnel and explosions. Medics say they're seeing damage to multiple parts of the body all at once.",
    "fullText": "The war in Ukraine is one of blast and shrapnel injuries, not gunshot wounds, a local medic and US veterans providing medical care in front-line areas told Business Insider.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine is characterized by fighting in extensive trench networks, where grenades continue to prove their worth, intense artillery fire, missile barrages, and drone attacks. Land mines also continue to be a problem.\n\nGunfights, however, are becoming less common.\n\nUS veterans and a Ukrainian medic told Business Insider that most combat injuries are caused by fragmentation and burns and that amputations are often necessary.\n\nThese injuries are not unusual for industrial, artillery-heavy conflicts, or more modern kinds of warfare, for that matter, but they are being exacerbated by new technology, such as exploding one-way attack drones and others that drop grenades and other deadly explosives.\n\n\"This is not a war of direct small-arms contact,\" the medic shared, \"but a war of remote destruction.\"\n\nKaterina Zirka, the Ukrainian combat medic, said that she increasingly sees injuries that affect multiple parts of the body at once, often without a single identifiable \"entry wound,\" but instead dozens of micro-injuries from blasts and shrapnel. The medical equipment she carries has changed as a result.\n\nMedics are also seeing internal blast injuries that don't come with external wounds, such as concussions, ruptured eardrums, and lung injuries from rapid changes in pressure, she said.\n\nSoldiers fighting in Ukraine have told Business Insider about being injured by exploding drones, mines, and falling debris when buildings are hit. Mortars, artillery, and rockets have also done their fair share of damage.\n\nA US veteran who fought in Ukraine and served as a combat medic for his unit previously told Business Insider that he saw a significant number of injuries from explosions, like burns, concussions, traumatic brain injuries, and wounds from shrapnel that resulted in amputations.\n\n\"Artillery is fucking everywhere out there. You go anywhere near the front, it's just artillery shell, artillery shell, artillery artillery,\" he said, speaking to BI on the condition of anonymity for operational security reasons.\n\nThe threats, however, are far more than artillery.\n\nJeffrey Wells, a US Navy veteran with experience in Afghanistan and Iraq, is involved in medical training for front-line Ukrainian civilians through a nonprofit organization, Task Force Antal, that also provides supplies and evacuation assistance. He shared details about the kinds of injuries he's seen in this role.\n\n\"Mostly people aren't being shot, even on the front lines,\" he explained. \"It's injuries that come from a missile, a drone, or a glide bomb.\"\n\nMark Antal, the co-founder of Task Force Antal and a veteran of the elite US special operations unit Delta Force, told Business Insider that he had to tell some of his group's medics that \"the soldiers on the front line, less than 2% of them are being shot. All of the wounds are from drones, from shrapnel.\"\n\nAnd with civilians, \"it's crush injuries, it's blast injuries.\"\n\nChristine Quinn Antal, a US Army veteran and former national security advisor who co-founded the nonprofit, said that with other injuries being significantly more prevalent, members have taken \"things like chest seals,\" tools used for gunshot wounds, out of their medical kits. \"We've moved away from that,\" she said.\n\nAway from the cities, out on the front lines, drones dominate warfare, but even in the close-quarters fighting, explosives, not necessarily guns, are key. There is still a role for guns in this war, but drones and other new tech are taking over classic combat roles, even the precision strike role of snipers.\n\nDrones are used in this war more than in any other conflict in history, and have fundamentally changed the shape of the war. Their ubiquity is shown by Ukraine's own stats. Its commander in chief said in November that drones were responsible for around 60% of all Russian targets hit.\n\nDrones direct traditional weapons but also engage targets as well. They are deadly tools readily available in large quantities at low costs, making them increasingly desirable tools as the war drags on.\n\nZirka said that injuries have changed because now, \"most engagements actually take place in the air through the use of drones. As a result, gunshot wounds are encountered much less frequently.\" Soldiers have told BI that drones have created a roughly 10-kilometer kill zone at the front.\n\nGuns are not gone from Ukraine, far from it, but it is a different kind of fighting. Soldiers carry and are trained on various guns for different missions, some of which sometimes actually lead to injuries that aren't gunshots.\n\nSoldiers often arm themselves against the ever-present threat of drones with electronic warfare tools and shotguns, among other systems. Shooting down drones, like the fiber-optic drones resistant to jamming, can generate dangerous shrapnel that can pierce or shred the skin.\n\nTroops also carry guns into trench warfare, which has been a prominent part of this fight.\n\nBut much of that fight also relies on other weapons, such as explosives like grenades and mines. These weapons are used to booby trap trenches and to try to clear them. The trenches can be so tight that it can make using firearms like assault rifles difficult.\n\nDrones are also used in trench battles, including by dropping grenades into enemy trenches or diving down on soldiers and exploding.\n\nLikewise, explosives are often used to clear bunkers as well. Charging into one for an extremely close-quarters firefight is exceptionally dangerous. A grenade, on the other hand, lowers the risk.\n\nUkraine has mounted machine guns and other weapons on its uncrewed ground robots, creating new ways to fire on the Russians using guns without putting its troops at risk, but these weapons are still quite limited for the time being. The same is true for the automated gun turrets.\n\nAs Zirka indicated, this war is more of a remote-explosive fight than a gunfight.",

    "fullText": "Last year, I moved from Michigan to Connecticut to live with my partner — and her parents.\n\nFor most of our relationship, my partner and I had lived in different places. We met in 2022 during grad school, began dating in the spring of 2023, and went long-distance when she moved back home to the East Coast later that fall.\n\nWe'd take turns visiting each other for a few days at a time, until we were finally given the opportunity to live in the same time zone. I accepted a job in New York in early 2025, without living in or near the city, and my girlfriend's parents made it possible.\n\nThey offered me a place to stay where I could commute into the city for work while I started my new job, adjusted to the distance from my own relatives, and most importantly, saved some money.\n\nThis wasn't how my partner and I had pictured moving in together, but we liked the idea of living in the same place. Being on the East Coast would also mean I'd get to spend more time with her extended family, too.\n\nMost 26-year-olds might not see the appeal of the situation, but for me, it was the only way.\n\nThere's an unspoken element of unemployment that we don't really talk about: the cost of accepting a job. I was excited to finally have a job offer, but at first, I wasn't sure that I'd be able to take it.\n\nThe role required me to relocate to one of the most expensive cities in the country, and after eight months without a full-time job — I'd just been doing freelance work and some side jobs — I couldn't realistically sign a lease.\n\nI needed to work a bit to save up for an apartment, but I also needed a place to stay to work. It was a Catch-22.\n\nAdd up additional moving costs, like packing supplies, a van or truck, and gas, and I was in a sticky situation.\n\nWhen my girlfriend's parents offered me a free place to stay indefinitely while I figured things out, it felt like things were falling into place.\n\nI have a hard time accepting help and not being in control. I like having my own space, and I was worried that if I moved into my partner's childhood home, I'd feel like I was invading someone else's domain or overstaying my welcome.\n\nThat said, I knew if I didn't move in with them, I wouldn't be able to take the job.\n\nAfter many conversations with my girlfriend about our expected timeline and the reality of living in someone else's space, I packed up two suitcases and booked a one-way flight to Connecticut.\n\nUpon arriving, I was greeted with a cleared-out closet and three empty dressers. My girlfriend, her parents, and her sister went through their vacant bedroom and emptied it of old clothes and other items so I could put my things away and feel at home, since my partner's closet and dresser were overflowing with her own things.\n\nI had my own desk, vanity, and space in the fridge and cabinets for food.\n\nWhen I was laid off from my job only six months after I moved to the East Coast, they didn't request a plan from me; they just continued to provide a safe space and feed me home-cooked meals.\n\nLooking back, I'm so glad I didn't move to New York City. Sure, it would've felt sour to be stuck in a lease without a job, but more than that, I would've missed out on late-night games of dominoes, happy hours on the patio, and our trivia team wins.\n\nIf you told me even a year ago that I'd be living in suburban Connecticut with my partner's family, I would've been shocked. It's what has worked best for us, though, and I wouldn't change it for anything.",

    "description": "The market reaction to Trump's latest attack on the Fed wasn't as sharp this time.",
    "fullText": "Even by his own market-moving standards, President Trump has been on a real tear lately.\n\nIt's been just over a week since he sent oil stocks surging by imploring US drillers to invest in the revitalization of Venezuela.\n\nAnd it's only been a few days since he stirred up volatility in defense stocks by first demanding they stop buybacks and dividends, then smoothing things over by pledging $1.5 trillion in military spending.\n\nThe Trump administration's latest major market disruption started on Sunday, on news the Justice Department had issued subpoenas to the Fed over a testimony from Jerome Powell on building renovations.\n\nIf there's one thing the market has shown in recent years, it's that it doesn't like any sort of challenge to Fed independence. The standard rebellious response to this, over time, has been the \"Sell America\" trade, which sees traders dump US stocks, Treasury bonds, and the dollar.\n\nWhat transpired on Monday was hardly the most drastic \"Sell America\" event we've had (and we've had a few at this point). But it still sets high stakes for the three asset classes in question:\n\nAfter an initial knee-jerk reaction sharply lower, major US indexes finished the day slightly higher. It was a more muted reaction than we've seen after past Fed attacks.\n\nPerhaps investors are already invoking the TACO trade, and expecting Trump to \"chicken out\" and temper his stance. It's also possible that, at this point, they're simply used to Powell brushing off Trump and forging ahead. Plus he also only has four months left in his term.\n\nA client note from the JPMorgan Securities trading desk stressed caution around stocks in the wake of the DOJ subpoenas. The firm said the latest threats make the Supreme Court's upcoming decision on Trump's ability to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook even more important.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield rose as much as 4 basis points on Monday before paring the increase. This is a common reaction under the \"sell America\" trade as investors dump US-denominated debt. Still, like with stocks, the reaction was minor.\n\nGiven the lack of reaction, attention is instead focused on last week's December jobs report. The data prompted JPMorgan's chief US economist to adjust his rate-cut forecast. He now expects zero cuts in 2026, and a rate hike in 2027.\n\nIf the \"Sell America\" narrative persists in any form — and if the market eventually agrees the Fed's rate-cut voyage is truly over — expect yields to rise again.\n\nThe dollar index — which assesses the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies — fell as much as 0.5% on Monday. Divesting from the dollar is a core element of the \"Sell America\" trade.\n\nThe dollar is fresh off being the worst-performing major currency of 2025. While a weak currency comes with some positives — like a nation's exports being worth more — it can also reflect a lack of faith in its financial system.",

And I just don't think we have enough information at this point,\" Barnum added, saying a dramatic shift in lenders' card interest rates could lead to negative consequences for consumers — \"especially the people who need it the most.\"\n\nOn Friday, President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post that he would call for a 10% cap on credit card interest for one year, starting on January 20. Lawmakers from both parties have criticized card interest rates, which have sat around 20% in recent years, according to Bloomberg.\n\nCongress would typically need to approve such a cap, which would eat into banks' profits.\n\nJamie Dimon, the firm's CEO, who was also on the call, said reducing card interest rates could adversely affect customers with lower credit scores by limiting access to credit. \"If it happened the way it was described, it would be dramatic,\" Dimon added.\n\nThe bank's cards business is central to its retail-focused offerings. Debit and credit card sales volume rose 7% from a year earlier, with card services sales totaling about $360 billion for the quarter, according to its earnings presentation.\n\nRevenue in the consumer and community banking division climbed 6% year over year to $19.4 billion, which JPMorgan said was driven in part by higher net interest income from card services as revolving balances grew.\n\nNow, JPMorgan is in the process of taking over the Apple card from Goldman Sachs, which previously supported the tech giant's credit card offering. The transition, JPMorgan has said, is expected to take up to two years to complete.\n\nRepresentatives for Chase previously directed Business Insider to a joint statement from the Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum, and Independent Community Bankers of America, which said they support Trump's goal of helping Americans access affordable credit, but warned of reduced credit availability.\n\n\"If enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives,\" the bank said.\n\nThe idea ignited a sell-off in major financial stocks on Monday, including JPMorgan. Trump's move continued a series of swipes against big businesses, including banks.",

    "fullText": "Metal and mining stocks are in the spotlight amid a blistering rally in precious and industrial metals in the last year, and Bank of America has three stock picks for investors looking to ride the wave.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's return to the White House brought renewed focus on US domestic mining and the supply of critical minerals, and BofA is confident that the mining and metals sector is poised for even more growth in 2026.\n\nBofA analyst Lawson Winder expects the same forces that drove growth for precious and industrial metals miners in 2025 to continue throughout 2026. The list of bullish factors includes industrial policy, more geopolitical uncertainty, and a weakening US dollar, as well as further tariff pressure.\n\nThe analyst remains more bullish on large-cap mining stocks. While precious metals are the bank's top sub-sector, Winder and his team are also focused on companies that mine nuclear energy materials and copper.\n\nHere are the banks' top three stock picks in the sector for 2026:\n\n1-year return: +130% \nAgnico is one of the world's largest gold miners. It's BofA's top pick for precious metals miners due to both its pipeline of projects and the possibility that it could find even more gold in the near future. Winder also said that the company's management has a track record of meeting or exceeding targets.\n\n1-year gain: +123% \nBofA sees Cameco, its top pick in the uranium mining space, as an undervalued play on a fast-growing subsector with significant growth potential.\n\n\"We see significant potential hidden value, like its diversified exposure across the nuclear energy and fuel supply chains,\" Winder said. \"We see a sharp H2'26E price recovery for uranium (CCJ's key product), and see the shares reasonably valued.\"\n\n1-year gain: +50%\nWith copper prices expected to surge in the coming years due to demand from AI producers, BofA sees Freeport-McMoRan as the best stock for exposure to the industrial metal's continued rise.\n\nWinder views the current low price as an attractive entry point and notes that it can also offer investors meaningful exposure to the gold mining industry.\n\nThe analyst added that BofA believes one force is particularly likely to keep driving growth for metals and mining companies into 2026, fueling its optimism for the sector.\n\n\"There is one consistent theme relevant to the M&M space from the past four years that to us looks to continue and possibly accelerate, that is rising geopolitical tensions,\" Winder said. \"For the M&M sector, this has been particularly impactful in the form of import and export bans and tariffs.\"",

    "description": "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame said Nvidia is \"simply the purest play\" for an investor to bet against the AI boom.",
    "fullText": "Michael Burry says he's betting against Nvidia instead of Meta, Alphabet, or Microsoft because the chipmaker is particularly vulnerable to the AI boom ending in disaster.\n\nNvidia is \"simply the purest play,\" Burry wrote in a Substack post last weekend. The company has become \"entirely dependent on hyperscaler spending, and I do not see how that math works,\" he continued.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing online late last year, added that Nvidia is likely to \"sell $400 billion of its chips this year and there are less than $100 billion in application layer use cases.\"\n\n\"Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted,\" Burry wrote. \"So shorting it is cheap.\"\n\nBurry also name-checked CoreWeave, a provider of cloud services built for AI and a strategic partner of Nvidia, calling it the graphics-processor giant's \"pet.\"\n\nNvidia's stock price has surged 12-fold since the start of 2023, making the graphics-chip maker the world's most valuable public company with a $4.5 trillion market capitalization.\n\nNvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBurry said that betting against Meta would mean he was \"also shorting its social media/advertising dominance,\" and placing a wager against Alphabet would mean he was \"shorting Google Search in all its forms, Android, Waymo, etc.\"\n\nHe added that being short Microsoft would be tantamount to \"shorting a global office productivity SaaS goliath,\" referring to the company's software-as-a-service tools, including Word and Excel.\n\nThose Big Tech titans aren't \"pure shorts on AI\" and have staying power, Burry wrote.\n\n\"They will realize they should not be spending so much, write off assets, and possibly restate earnings,\" he said. \"But they still are dominant companies globally away from the AI buildout.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Burry said he would short OpenAI if it were a public company. He highlighted the ChatGPT maker's $500 billion valuation in October, which exceeds the market values of Johnson & Johnson, Bank of America, and Costco.\n\nBurry said he owns bearish put options on Oracle, and directly shorted the database company in the last six months.\n\n\"I do not like how it is positioned or the investments it is making,\" he wrote, adding that the company, cofounded by tech billionaire Larry Ellison, is making unnecessary, inexplicable moves and \"ego\" might be the driver.\n\nBurry is famous for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble, an episode of his career that was chronicled in the book and movie \"The Big Short.\"\n\nHe wrote on Substack that \"technological obsolescence is on the menu as Nvidia now seems to introduce a new chip solution every year or less.\"\n\nThat echoed a previous post in which he said Nvidia's Big Tech customers were overstating the lifespan of its chips to drag out their depreciation and flatter their short-term profits, raising the prospect of future writedowns.\n\nBurry also warned of trouble ahead, saying he's betting against AI stocks to \"have the exposure on the right side when the music stops.\"\n\nBurry spoke about AI more broadly in his post, drawing a parallel between its rise and the history of electricity.\n\nHe pointed out that building power plants and grids in the late 1980s and early 1990s required \"massive upfront capital outlays,\" technological advances meant equipment such as transformers became quickly outdated and assets rapidly depreciated, and \"cutthroat price warfare\" between suppliers meant many ran into financial difficulties and were forced to merge with rivals.\n\n\"What I see in electrification is very similar to what happened during the 2000 data transmission bubble and what I see happening with the AI bubble,\" he wrote.\n\nBurry said that electricity was as transformative to the modern world as a medicine that enables a patient to walk 10 feet, whereas AI \"might be the anabolic steroid that allows superhuman feats of strength and ability,\" but could ultimately prove \"more dangerous than anything.\"\n\nHe also repeated his caution that if the US tries to win the AI race by going all-in on increasingly power-hungry chips, it will lose as China is ramping up its power-generation capacity much more quickly.\n\n\"I see a big inventory problem in the AI buildout as a result of the current power generation setup,\" Burry said.",

    "fullText": "There's more evidence that healthcare jobs are a bright spot in the US job market.\n\nJob-search platform Indeed published its new list of the best jobs to \"get hired and thrive.\" After analyzing thousands of roles based on job postings, wage growth, and other factors, Indeed found many of the top ones were in healthcare.\n\n\"The data-driven snapshot weighs current job openings against three-year growth trends to identify the 'sweet spot' of the market — careers that aren't just stable for today, but are positioned for long-term mobility and security in the future,\" the new report said.\n\nIndeed said that jobs with a salary floor of $65,000 had priority because they pay above the overall median.\n\nLaura Ullrich, director of economic research in North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Business Insider that the list suggests that specialized roles and sectors where it's harder to pause hiring are strong corners of the job market, such as healthcare.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics data showed last year's job growth was cooler than the past few years, but healthcare and social assistance powered through. They're more resilient to cyclical changes.\n\n\"It's hard to take a pause in hiring in that sector compared to maybe some typical business sectors,\" Ullrich said.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that employment of nurse practitioners, which ranked No. 3 on Indeed's new list, is projected to grow 40% from 2024 to 2034. The employment of data scientists, which ranked No. 10 on Indeed's list, is also expected to grow rapidly over the decade, increasing by 33.5%.\n\nBelow are the top 10 jobs and estimates from Indeed.\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: 15%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: -3%\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: 8%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: 26%\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: 13%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: 6%\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: 0%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: 8%\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: -32%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: 20%\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: -17%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: 33%\n\n\"Those that are in the top 10 that have negative postings growth have high values for either overall postings, wages, wage growth, or remote options,\" Ullrich said.\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: 11%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: 14%\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: -2%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: 10%\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: 39%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: -5%\n\nRecent three-year growth in job postings: 34%\n\nRecent three-year wage growth: 34%",

    "description": "Paige Chenault Lohoefer shares why she founded The Birthday Party Project. It brings joy, consistency, and celebration to homeless children.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Paige Chenault Lohoefer, the founder of The Birthday Party Project. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started my career as an event planner. In 2008, I was pregnant with my first and only child, and I was on an airplane while reading an article about kids' birthday parties and dreaming about all the ways I could celebrate my daughter. The next magazine had an image of a child in Haiti, with sunken eyes and a bloated belly, with chaos and destruction behind him. All I could think about was, \"What about him? He might never feel celebrated.\"\n\nAt that moment, I decided that all kids should be celebrated, but I knew I didn't have to go far to make it happen — there were kids in our backyard in Dallas who needed it.\n\nWe launched The Birthday Party Project in Dallas in 2012, and we now operate in 21 cities with 80 agency partners.\n\nI first had to understand what homelessness is and isn't. It can be families who are fleeing domestic violence situations, or families where two parents have jobs, but they can't make ends meet. There are teens who the foster system has failed, and they need to live independently, and there are families who find themselves in transition for one reason or another.\n\nOur first agency, Family Gateway, said that people come in all the time and show up a few times, and then stop coming back. Kids crave consistency, so they asked us to commit to showing up every month.\n\nWe structured it so that once a month, we go and bring our Birthday Enthusiasts, our volunteers, and host hour-long birthday celebrations. We have one partner we've been partying with every month for 13 years.\n\nWe see more birthdays around the first months of the year, because more kids enter shelters then. Domestic violence has peak seasons. Parents and kids will go home and try to be a family during the holidays because they want to create a sense of togetherness and make memories, but it can become stressful. Kids are out of school, they have to feed them differently, work changes, money has been spent — it's a more chaotic environment, and domestic violence rises.\n\nWe treat the agency like a home, because it is, and we decorate for a themed birthday bash. We get a list in advance with birthday kids' wishes, and we're always prepared with extra gifts.\n\nEvery celebrated kid gets an individual cake or cupcake and candle, and every person staying there is invited, whether you're a kid or a kid at heart. The kids are so excited to be kids, running and playing. The parents are there, of course, and they can give the gift to their kid. In domestic violence shelters, we love for the mom to be the hero for a change.\n\nI didn't expect this when I began the organization, but our parties give kids a sense of relief. They all might enter with different energy, some are shy, and some come barreling through, but they seem to leave the same, with a bit more confidence and sense of purpose.\n\nI think when people feel seen, it changes everything for them. They get that responsibility taken off their shoulders. They leave the party with their shoulders back, eyes wide, and smiles on their faces.\n\nJoy changes lives, a joyful community can change the world, and celebrations build connections. It's powerful to see what can happen in one hour with the right people in the room.",

    "description": "As someone who loves making protein coffee at home, I decided to try and compare new protein drinks from Starbucks and Dunkin', including iced lattes.",
    "fullText": "Starbucks and Dunkin' are two of the latest chains to incorporate protein into their menus, offering a range of souped-up beverages.\n\nAs someone who first hopped on the \"proffee\" trend — mixing a protein powder or shake into coffee — when it started gaining traction a few years ago, my interest was piqued.\n\nI've been making my own drinks at home to better reap the many benefits of protein while making my morning coffee more satisfying.\n\nHowever, I was curious to see how the new offerings from Dunkin' and Starbucks stacked up — and whether they'd replace my at-home recipe.\n\nNaturally, I decided to put them to the test.\n\nStarbucks first launched a line of protein-heavy beverages in the fall of 2025.\n\nAlong with lattes made using protein-boosted milk, the chain rolled out numerous flavors of protein-packed cold foam, including vanilla, brown sugar, and banana.\n\nA few months later, to kick off the new year, Starbucks introduced two new caramel protein beverages: a caramel protein matcha and a caramel protein latte.\n\nTo date, there are eight signature beverages, all of which contain at least 27 grams of protein in a 12-ounce, grande-sized drink. You can also add protein milk or protein cold foam to any other hot or iced coffee drink.\n\nOn this visit, I decided to try two protein beverages: an iced protein matcha and an iced caramel protein latte.\n\nThe drink includes milk, classic syrup, matcha, and protein powder, and the grande size contains an impressive 36 grams of protein.\n\nThe matcha, which cost me $6.45, was surprisingly great. I found that it tasted just like a regular iced matcha, and I didn't detect any sort of protein-powder taste.\n\nNext, I tried the new iced caramel protein latte, which cost $6.95.\n\nThe drink's ingredient list includes milk, brewed espresso, caramel syrup, and protein powder, and a grande size contains 27 grams of protein.\n\nAs someone who used to love Starbucks caramel macchiatos, I was excited by the prospect of enjoying a sweet, rich treat in the morning, all while getting a protein boost.\n\nAfter just one sip, though, I immediately — and unfortunately — knew this would not be a repeat order. I was greeted with delicious caramel notes, but I also noticed a saccharine, artificial-tasting aftertaste.\n\nI'd compare this latte to grab-and-go protein drinks from the grocery store. For almost $7, I'd hoped the protein powder aftertaste would be nonexistent, and that — like the iced protein matcha — this one would taste more like a regular iced latte.\n\nDunkin's new protein menu launched with five signature drinks — including a strawberry protein refresher and almond matcha protein latte — all made using a protein-boosted milk.\n\nAll of the drinks contain 15 grams of protein in a 14-ounce hot cup or 24-ounce iced cup. Just like at Starbucks, guests can also add protein milk to other coffee beverages.\n\nTo keep things fair, I tried two drinks that seemed similar to what I'd ordered at Starbucks: an iced almond matcha protein latte and a caramel-chocolate protein latte.\n\nI paid $7.99 for the chain's medium-sized almond iced protein matcha latte, which contains 15 grams of protein.\n\nDunkin's recipe contains matcha blend, cane sugar, toasted-almond flavor, and green tea, along with the chain's new protein-rich milk.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't exactly love it. Instead of that green, earthy taste I typically associate with matcha lattes, there was a sharp, tangy note — probably due to the almond flavor — that I found distracting.\n\nOn the other hand, I was impressed by the medium-sized Dunkin' iced caramel-chocolate protein latte, which contains 15 grams of protein and cost me $7.59.\n\nAfter my first sip, my eyes grew wide. This one had a similar ingredient list to Starbucks' caramel protein latte — brewed espresso, caramel-chocolate syrup, and protein milk, with the additions of brown sugar and molasses — but I loved this drink so much more.\n\nDunkin's protein latte tasted like a dessert in a cup, and it didn't have any overly sweet, artificial aftertaste.\n\nOverall, Starbucks had my favorite protein matcha drink, and Dunkin' had my favorite protein latte.\n\nOf all the drinks, though, I found the Dunkin' caramel-chocolate latte to be the tastiest.\n\nStill, I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to buy any of these drinks again — in part because of the price.\n\nI'd prefer to save the extra bucks and make a \"proffee\" at home with milk, protein powder, Trader Joe's bourbon vanilla-bean paste, and espresso.\n\nHowever, if I were out and wanted a quick caffeine and protein boost after a grueling workout session, I'd definitely swing by Dunkin' and buy that latte as a special treat.",

    "description": "Geopolitics and economic shifts are some of the \"unsettling\" factors that could hit the AI trade in 2026, Mohamed El-Erian said.",
    "fullText": "AI-driven market mania will hit a roadblock this year, Mohamed El-Erian says.\n\nThe top economist and former co-CIO at PIMCO sees trouble ahead for the AI trade. While artificial intelligence powered the market to fresh records in 2025, that rally is likely to stumble this year thanks to \"unsettling\" structural changes in markets and the economy, he said in a recent op-ed for Project Syndicate.\n\nThe former bond trader advised investors to shift their strategy in the coming year, focusing more on fundamentals and identifying firms able to use AI in \"practical applications.\"\n\n\"As we move further into 2026, the AI narrative is unlikely to prove strong enough to continue overshadowing other lingering uncertainties, many of which reflect deeper structural shifts,\" El-Erian wrote on Monday. \"For investors, the standard playbook will need to change. Riding a broad structural wave is no longer such an obvious and rewarding strategy.\"\n\nHe pointed to a few trends he believed could rattle the AI trade this year:\n\nThe US economy is seeing a \"'K-shaped' divergence,\" El-Erian said, referring to an economic model where the gap between high-income and low-income Americans widens.\n\nThat has a troubling implication for economic growth, El-Erian suggested. Speaking at Yahoo Finance's Invest Conference last year, he said that he believed lower-income consumers were already \"near recession,\" pointing to pressures like elevated inflation, rising layoffs, and high consumer debt levels.\n\n\"If the lower household incomes stop spending, not because they don't want to spend, but they're not able to spend — that will contaminate upwards for the economy as a whole,\" he said at the time.\"\n\nInternational conflict is another issue that could hurt the appetite for AI among investors, El-Erian said. He pointed to rising tensions between the US and Venezuela after the US raided the country and captured its president earlier this month, which sparked fresh market volatility.\n\n\"Wherever you look, the traditional factors underlying economic and commercial activity are likely to be increasingly sidelined by national-security concerns, geopolitics, and domestic political machinations,\" he wrote. If 2025 was about ignoring the market spillovers of domestic and international politics, 2026 will be about navigating them.\"\n\nFears that the market may have run ahead of itself when pricing in the benefits from AI are another limiting factor on the rally, El-Erian suggested.\n\n\"The animal spirits that drove indiscriminate, massive financing last year will increasingly be tamed by bubble fears that force investors to be more selective,\" he added.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo Finance! last year, El-Erian described AI as a \"rational bubble,\" which he said could result in painful losses for investors down the line.\n\nEl-Erian, who was vocal about the risks of a recession and a potential stock market crash as interest rates were rising, has struck a milder but still-cautious tone more recently. Lately, he's held off on making concrete recession or stock calls, but has warned of a slew of signals that worry him in financial markets.",

    "description": "Dimon said the bank's expected $9 billion spending increase would help it stay competitive not only with other big banks, but also fintech companies.",
    "fullText": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon defended the bank's significant spending, especially on AI and tech, during its Tuesday morning earnings call, noting that he's not only competing with other banking behemoths, but also fintech companies.\n\n\"We are going to stay out front, so help us God,\" Dimon said about the expenditures, capping off a somewhat fiery response to a question on the bank's spending from Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo. He said that the firm's not only competing against its traditional Wall Street rivals, but also fintechs like Stripe, SoFi, and Revolut, which \"are good players.\"\n\nHe added, \"We're not going to try to meet some expense target, and then 10 years from now, you'd be asking us a question, how did JPMorgan get left behind?\"\n\nIn its fourth-quarter earnings presentation, JPMorgan projected spending around $9.7 billion \n\nDimon didn't give specifics on the upcoming AI spending — he said that he's already \"been quite blunt,\" but wouldn't provide information that risk putting him at \"a competitive disadvantage\" — but said he sees huge opportunities, including in AI. While he acknowledged concerns about big spending, he said that it's the right thing to do to grow the company.\n\n\"Part of it is to trust me, I'm sorry,\" Dimon said on the anticipated returns.\n\nThe CEO said that the bank will be spending more on AI, \"but it is not a big driver\" of increased expenditures. The technology will, however, likely drive future efficiency, he said.\n\nDimon said that the bank is investing across initiatives, but that tech spending can be harder to measure or evaluate.\n\n\"We need to have the best tech in the world,\" he continued. \"That drives investment, it drives margin, it drives competition.\"\n\nLast week, JPMorgan announced plans to discontinue its use of external proxy advisors for shareholder voting in the US. In place of external human advisors, the firm is launching an in-house AI platform, called Proxy IQ, to support shareholder decisions, according to the memo.\n\nJPMorgan has implemented training programs and internal courses to teach tens of thousands of employees how to use AI tools effectively in their day-to-day work, executives have previously said.\n\nThe bank's top officials have said that junior staffers are likely to get their first experiences in management by overseeing the activities of agentic bots.\n\nArtificial intelligence specialists and technologists are among Wall Street's most sought-after minds, pitting banks against hedge funds and Big Tech in a race to claim the top talent in the space.\n\nExperts have told Business Insider in recent days to expect 2026 to be a landmark year for AI in banking, as its adoption becomes more widespread and roles experience material changes.",

    "fullText": "JPMorgan says it's going to do something about its desk problem.\n\nAmerica's biggest bank, which called its roughly 320,000-person-strong global workforce back to the office five days a week last year, has previously experienced internal tensions over desk availability and parking at some sites, like its major tech campus in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nNow, the firm says it will tackle its office woes head-on.\n\n\"If you think about what's happened to the head count of the company over, say, the last five or six years, it's grown a lot,\" Jeremy Barnum, the firm's chief financial officer, told shareholders during the bank's Tuesday earnings call.\n\n\"There was the whole return to the office, hot desking, remote work, all the stuff,\" he added. \"The amount of real estate square footage over that period grew a lot more slowly than headcount.\"\n\nBut the lack of ample space didn't deter the company from pushing ahead with its full-time office mandate.\n\n\"We've realized that it's obviously the case that we need to provide employees a reasonable in-office experience and that, in some cases, means a little bit of de-densification and catching up on some space renovations around the world,\" Barnum continued.\n\nOn the call, CEO Jamie Dimon chimed in.\n\n\"Don't scare them,\" he told Barnum, presumably about alarming analysts about rising spending. \"Real estate,\" Dimon said, \"is very small numbers.\"\n\nThe firm has already opened a new state-of-the-art headquarters at 270 Park Avenue in Manhattan — a cutting-edge skyscraper featuring a bevy of restaurants, a luxurious fitness center, and tech that even remembers how you like the temperature when you reserve a conference room.\n\nThe bank's five-day-per-week return-to-office policy proved a heated flashpoint last year, with Dimon famously telling some of the 12,000 staffers at the Columbus site that he suspected remote workers were texting one another during meetings and not completing tasks.\n\nLast spring, a JPMorgan spokesperson told Business Insider that the firm was \"working hard to ensure our sites have the capacity and amenities employees need to return full-time.\"",

To make it taste even better, I made a little sandwich out of the ingredients.\n\nI recommend the Amtrak roomette for those looking for a more affordable overnight accommodation.

    "description": "Mina Starsiak Hawk first revealed in August 2023 that her relationship with her mom and \"Good Bones\" costar Karen E. Laine was strained.",
    "fullText": "Nearly three years after going public about the strain in their relationship, HGTV star Mina Starsiak Hawk described her relationship with her mother, Karen E. Laine, as \"amicable.\"\n\nOn their HGTV series, \"Good Bones,\" which premiered in 2016, Hawk and Laine renovated homes in Indianapolis through their company Two Chicks and a Hammer. Laine stepped back from the company in 2019 but continued appearing on the show.\n\nThe series quickly became popular on the network, as did its spinoff, \"Good Bones: Risky Business.\" In August 2023, Hawk announced the series was ending and opened up about the fraught nature of her relationship with Laine on her podcast \"Mina AF.\"\n\n\"Good Bones\" briefly returned for a limited season in August 2024, though Hawk and Laine appeared on the series separately.\n\nIn the year and a half since, it seems tensions may have thawed between the mother and daughter, as Hawk shared in a new interview with People.\n\nTake a look back at Hawk and Laine's rise to fame and how their relationship shifted in recent years.\n\nRepresentatives for Hawk did not respond to a request for comment, and Laine declined to comment.\n\nBecause Hawk and Laine's operation was a family business, their other relatives, including some of Hawk's siblings, started appearing on the show over the course of its run.\n\nHawk has five siblings, as she and Laine explained in a video for HGTV: brothers William and CR; Kelsy, a half-sister through her mother; and Tad and Jessica, half-siblings through her father's second marriage.\n\nHawk and her husband, Stephen, who have been married since 2016, share two children: Jack and Charlotte. The pair also cared for Jessica's daughter, Julie, for some time in 2017, as People reported at the time.\n\nAlthough Hawk and Laine described their family tree as \"complicated\" in their HGTV video, their blended family appeared happy to viewers at home as the pair transformed their hometown with a sense of love and community.\n\nThen, Hawk revealed in August 2023 that things weren't as simple when the cameras were off.\n\nOn an episode of \"Mina AF,\" titled \"The Pain of Staying the Same,\" that aired on August 28, 2023, Hawk spoke about change and boundaries, opening up about how her son's 5th birthday party spurred her to think about how she wanted to approach her relationship with certain members of her family — including Laine — moving forward.\n\nJack turned 5 on August 9, 2023, and as she shared on Instagram, Hawk hosted a party for him three days later.\n\nOn her podcast, which was recorded ahead of Jack's birthday, she said she had invited her family members to her kids' birthday parties in years past, but she wasn't sure she wanted to invite them that year.\n\n\"My family is challenging, and I've been going back and forth about who do I want to be able to be present at this party?\" she said. \"Will it affect my kids? Will they even notice who's here and not here? There's gonna be a bunch of animals. That's all they care about. Am I being true to myself and my husband by setting appropriate boundaries for certain people to be here or not be here?\"\n\nShe went on to say that she was unsure if she wanted to invite her mom and some of her siblings because of \"the current state of affairs\" of their relationships.\n\n\"My mom and I aren't in a great place,\" she said. \"My brother Tad and I aren't in a great place. My brother William and I are kind of like nonexistent place. It's complicated without even being complicated. We don't really engage much, and the last engagement wasn't super positive. And that was maybe a year ago.\"\n\nHawk also said she wanted to prioritize inviting people to Jack's birthday party who are in his day-to-day life, which doesn't include her family.\n\n\"Not only do my mom and my two brothers not fall into that category of being involved in their life on a regular basis, we're also not on good terms,\" she said, adding that members of her family are typically cordial to one another and still gather for family events even if they have tension, largely because it's important to her father.\n\n\"Whenever there's an event, we all put our big kid pants on and pretend to be nice to each other and do the event, and then go back to our corners of the universe and talk shit about each other,\" Hawk said. She added that her family members had been able to \"coexist\" on a vacation together, though she didn't say when. However, she went on to say that the system no longer worked for her.\n\n\"I just don't want to do that,\" she said. \"Because that doesn't feel genuine. It doesn't feel real. And it's just not what I want my life to be.\"\n\nHawk did not say whether she and Stephen decided to invite her mother and brothers to Jack's birthday party on the podcast episode, though the family members did not appear in any of the photos she posted from the event. In the caption of her Instagram post about the event, she gave a shout-out to the people who support Jack.\n\nHawk told People in September 2023 that she did not end up inviting those family members to Jack's birthday.\n\nHawk shared on a separate podcast episode recorded earlier in 2023 and released on August 7 that \"Good Bones\" was ending after eight seasons.\n\n\"It's the end of an era,\" she said in the episode, titled \"And That's a Wrap… Or Is It?\"\n\nHawk said she and HGTV mutually agreed to end the series, adding that the stress of the show was becoming too much for her in part because her team was typically working on five to eight projects at the same time due to the demands of television.\n\nAnd while she wanted to have a slower work pace, Hawk was concerned about how her employees would be affected if she chose to step back, as she wouldn't need as many staff members if she were working on fewer homes at a time.\n\n\"All the things that I was putting on myself, it was making it really, really hard to function as, like, a normal human being, because I always felt the weight of so many other people's worlds that I put on my shoulders,\" she said. \"I got to a point where I think I kind of felt like, whether it made sense or not, it felt like I was fighting for my life, or fighting for my family's life, fighting for my employees' lives, to figure something out, to find a solution, to find the next thing.\"\n\n\"I just became a version of myself that I really didn't like,\" she said.\n\nUltimately, Hawk said ending the series was the right choice for her husband and children.\n\nLaine didn't formally comment on \"Good Bones\" ending, though she did indicate she was open to more opportunities with HGTV in the comments section of an Instagram post.\n\nLaine posted a photo of herself with Hawk on August 10, 2023, promoting the eighth season of the show, and a user commented that they were \"bummed\" the show was coming to an end.\n\n\"Just because Mina says it's over for her doesn't mean the future doesn't hold something for me,\" Laine replied.\n\nAnd after Hawk's announcement, HGTV said in a statement, \"While this is the end of 'Good Bones' as we know it, we're currently in talks with Mina and Karen about other projects.\"\n\nHawk shed more light on her relationship with her mother in an interview with People published on September 7, 2023, saying that they were \"in some of the most challenging places I felt we've been\" when they filmed season eight.\n\nShe also said that in the season eight premiere, she and Laine had \"a knockdown drag-out [fight] during the demo.\"\n\nHawk went on to tell People that she has always felt her relationship with her mother was complicated, despite what people may have gleaned from \"Good Bones.\"\n\n\"And from what people know from the show, my mom and I are thick as thieves, best friends, and because they just don't know anything else, they assume that's how it's always been,\" she told People. \"And I think a lot of people really aspire to that, so they don't want to know other stuff, which is fine. But my mom and I have had a very rocky relationship since I have memories.\"\n\nHawk also told People that she and Laine bonded when she was in college and when they started their business, but she never felt close to her in a traditional parent-child sense.\n\n\"When we became close, we became close as friends,\" she told People. \"We never were really close as 'You are my mom; you take care of me. I'm your daughter; I look to you to be a safe place.'\"\n\nHawk shared in an October 2023 podcast episode that she and her mother were not speaking, saying, \"We do not talk. We haven't in a long time.\"\n\nOn July 17, HGTV announced that a new season of \"Good Bones\" would premiere on August 14, 2024, nearly a year after the eighth season premiered.\n\nThe season spotlighted Hawk and Laine renovating homes, but unlike in past seasons, they didn't work together. The announcement also said the series would only have a three-week run.\n\n\"The newest season of HGTV's hit series 'Good Bones' will follow Mina Starsiak Hawk and her mom Karen E Laine as their lives evolve past their time renovating homes in Indianapolis,\" a press release for the show reviewed by Business Insider said.\n\n\"Mina will purchase a very dated but 'groovy' lake house just north of Indy and give it much-needed cosmetic updates to create the peaceful family getaway of her dreams. Karen will set off on a new adventure in Wilmington, North Carolina, where she'll risk her retirement nest egg on a bungalow that requires more work than anticipated to become a colorful beachy oasis,\" it said.\n\nThe first episode aired on August 14, 2024, and focused on Hawk's renovation of a lake house she and her husband bought for their family in Martinsville, Indiana. Laine encouraged people to watch the series with an Instagram photo of Hawk that she shared the day the episode aired.\n\n\"'Good Bones: New Beginnings' starts tonight, 8/14, at 9 pm on @hgtv with Mina's lakehouse Reno,\" she wrote. \"My Wilmington NC Reno will air 8/21 and 28, same bat time, same bat station.\"\n\nThe first episode of the season also gave insight into how Hawk was moving forward professionally after distancing herself from her mother.\n\nIn episode one, Hawk said that she only had one full-time employee for Two Chicks and a Hammer and would be doing far fewer renovations a year than the 12 the company used to do annually. The episode showed her renting out the former headquarters for Two Chicks and a Hammer, and she also decided to close the original store location, District Co., and reopen it in another area.\n\nLaine did not appear in episode one, nor did Hawk mention her.\n\nHowever, on August 21, 2024, Hawk posted an Instagram photo of Laine and \"Good Bones\" star Michael J. Coyle to promote the show, confirming in the caption that she wouldn't appear in Laine's episodes of the show.\n\n\"Another new episode tonight at 9 y'all! Check it out on @hgtv 💪🏼 When you're not designing for resale you get to make it yours and use SO much more color. It's a whole different ball game,\" she wrote. \"And before you ask, no I'm not in it. But you'll see some familiar faces!!! So check it out.\"\n\nIn episodes two and three, Laine spent time in both Indianapolis and Wilmington, North Carolina, where she bought a fixer-upper for herself.\n\n\"I retired in 2019, and I can do anything I want,\" Laine said of her approach to the next chapter of her life.\n\nShe added that she wanted to be in Wilmington because she loves the beach town, but also planned to spend time in Indianapolis with her grandkids, referring to her son CR's four children.\n\nDuring episodes two and three, CR's children appeared with Laine, as did her daughter Kelsy, who gave birth to her first child during filming.\n\n\"This is the first time in my life I'm in a position where I can really invest time in being the kind of grandparent I want to be,\" she said.\n\nLaine did not mention Hawk's children in her episodes, and Hawk and Laine have not made many announcements about future projects they may be working on with HGTV, either.\n\nHawk and Laine didn't say much about their relationship after the final season of \"Good Bones\" aired, and they worked on separate projects. Laine also listed the Wilmington home she had renovated on the series in October 2024.\n\nThen, in January 2026, Hawk spoke to People's Erin Clements about her appearance on the coming season of \"Rock the Block,\" and during their chat, she gave an update on the status of her relationship with Laine.\n\nHawk said the strain between her and her mother had grown over time, so it would take time to repair.\n\n\"It took us a lot of time to get there,\" she said. \"So I think it takes a lot of time to kind of get out of it as well.\"\n\nHowever, Hawk said she and her mother are on speaking terms and even spent the 2025 holidays together.\n\n\"We were all together for the holidays, so we're all amicable,\" she said. \"We're not like best friends that braid each other's hair on Saturday nights or anything, but no, it's good.\"",

    "description": "When my partner and I broke up right before our international trip we'd planned together, I'm glad I decided to go anyway and make it a solo trip.",
    "fullText": "My boyfriend of two and a half years broke the long silence with the question we were both wondering: \"Are we still going?\"\n\nWe were supposed to be driving to the airport to leave for our five-day trip to Lisbon. Instead, we'd had an argument over the phone that morning that left me questioning how we'd even make it through a flight, let alone an international trip.\n\nOur relationship had been rocky for quite some time, but our travel plans were fast approaching, and I didn't want to give them up. The good news is we were flying standby, so our tickets were 100% refundable.\n\n\"You don't want to go?\" I asked. \"I can cancel your ticket right now.\"\n\nTurns out, he didn't think it was a good idea to still travel together — but, hey, I love a solo trip. We split. I kept my plane ticket.\n\nMy adrenaline was high and my heart was racing, but I ultimately felt relieved as I drove to the Boston airport alone, and boarded my flight.\n\nI cried a few times during the flight, but I couldn't stop smiling when I heard the pilot say, \"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Lisbon.\"\n\nI was so proud of myself for making it there alone — and, from there, the trip was surprisingly smooth.\n\nSince I'd used my credit-card points to book our hotel room, it was already in my name. I'd planned our whole itinerary myself anyway, so I just followed it on my own.\n\nThough I shed a few more tears while coping with our breakup, I found exploring a new country was a wonderful way to clear my mind.\n\nOver the next few days, I wandered around Lisbon's many viewpoints, ate amazing food, drank great wine, and even made some friends.\n\nWhile at a café, two girls noticed I was by myself and asked me to join their table. We spent over an hour divulging our life stories to each other.\n\nThe next day, I went on a guided excursion to Sintra, a beautiful town about 30 minutes away from Lisbon. At the beginning of the tour, a woman and her niece started chatting with me, and asked if I was alone.\n\nWhen I told them about the breakup, they decided to \"adopt\" me. We spent the day together hiking to Pena Palace (the town's colorful castle on a hill) and exploring the local shops.\n\nThroughout the trip, I couldn't stop thinking about how much happier I was than if I had come with my boyfriend. I got to enjoy the city at my own pace, without worrying about keeping the peace in my unstable relationship.\n\nFortunately, solo travel was not a new concept for me.\n\nNo matter my relationship status, I've always made time to travel on my own and, as a flight attendant, it comes naturally. It's nice to not have to worry about anyone else's budget or availability — I can just go where I want, when I want.\n\nTraveling solo was so in-character for me that when I posted about it on my Instagram, the only people who realized anything was wrong (or that I was fresh out of a relationship) were the ones I'd told.\n\nLater on, my friends told me they were proud of me for choosing to go on the trip alone. However, not going was never an option to me.\n\nIf I hadn't already been comfortable with traveling solo, I probably wouldn't have had the guts to go to Portugal by myself, and I would've missed out on what became an amazing, healing trip.\n\nHonestly, I'd encourage everyone to try solo travel, regardless of their relationship status. Navigating a new place on your own is a huge confidence boost and the best way to get to know yourself.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump told reporters that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is either \"incompetent\" or \"crooked.\"",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump isn't backing down from his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, even as an increasing number of fellow Republicans express a desire to cool tensions.\n\n\"Well, he's billions of dollars over budget,\" Trump told reporters at the White House Tuesday morning before departing for a trip to Michigan. \"So, he's either incompetent or he's crooked. I don't know what he is, but he certainly doesn't do a very good job.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Powell released an extraordinary video statement, confirming that he is under a criminal investigation for testimony he gave before Congress about renovations to the Fed's headquarters. Powell said that the probe was being conducted in retaliation for his repeated defiance of Trump's wishes regarding the independent central bank's setting of interest rates.\n\n\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said in a nearly two-minute video released by the Fed.\n\nPowell and the Fed have repeatedly denied that there is anything untoward about the cost overruns for the $2.5 billion renovations. In July, Powell accompanied Trump on a tour of the site where the pair sparred in front of reporters about the project.\n\n\"You just added in a third building is what that is,\" Powell said in July after Trump cited a figure that was higher than other estimates. \"It was built five years ago.\"\n\nAn FAQ on the Fed's website said the project has been costlier than expected due to a number of factors, including changes to the design, a larger-than-expected amount of asbestos, and the increase in the cost of materials.\n\nTrump told NBC News he had no knowledge of grand jury subpoenas being sent to the Fed. Amid a firestorm, US Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said that the Justice Department had no alternative but to subpoena the information.\n\n\"The United States Attorney's Office contacted the Federal Reserve on multiple occasions to discuss cost overruns and the chairman's congressional testimony, but were ignored, necessitating the use of legal process—which is not a threat,\" Pirro said in a statement posted on X on Monday night.\n\nIn 2017, Trump nominated Powell, who was already a member of the Fed's Board of Governors, to lead the central bank. Since then, Trump has soured on Powell and at times has mused about firing the Fed chair, though legal experts have disputed whether any president would have the power to do so.\n\nThe criminal probe into Powell could prove costly for the White House. Powell's term as chair is up in May. For months, Trump has conducted a public search for his replacement. In a closely-divided Senate, Trump cannot afford to lose Republican support for any potential nominee.\n\nAfter Powell's statement was released, Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, said he would not support any Trump nominee until the investigation \"is fully resolved.\" Tillis serves on the Senate Banking Committee, where Republicans hold a 13-11 majority. If Tillis remained opposed, the committee could deadlock — likely stalling the nomination or, at the very least, requiring Republicans to take the rare step of changing the chamber's rules.\n\nBeyond Tillis, a handful of other Republicans on Capitol Hill have also decried the criminal probe. All three living former Fed chairs, including Reagan appointee Alan Greenspan, have lined up behind Powell, as have the current leaders of central banks around the world.",

    "description": "I tested Cadence Capsules, a luxury-grade travel container system. They make it easy to measure out my skincare routine, but cost a fortune.",
    "fullText": "I'm turning 30 this year, and one of my goals for the next decade is to travel more (I know, so original). I just went on my first big international trip last year, though I wish I'd known about Cadence Capsules before I went.\n\nMy Instagram algorithm was a little late on the draw for me to invest in these expensive little pods so close to my trip, but I kept getting ads from polished jet-setter types about how amazing they are. So, I decided to test them out between now and my next adventure and see for myself about the hype.\n\nCadence Capsules are reusable toiletry containers designed to organize pills, lotions, potions, or any other tiny items that can easily get lost in a suitcase mid-travel. They're mostly for storing medications and beauty products, but you can get creative with how you fill them.\n\nA system is made up of matte hexagonal Capsules varying in size, which stack together magnetically (the same way Fenty beauty products do) with a satisfying, ASMR-level click. You can keep easily keep track of what's inside thanks to the several interchangeable magnetic tile labels, which to me look a lot cleaner and more efficient than my smudgy handwriting.\n\nBefore I went home for the holidays, I packed my petal pink Capsule system in its matching petal pink Cadence Parcel. It's a clear, quart-sized bag that meets TSA requirements (and looks good doing it). It's not my favorite travel makeup bag I've ever used, but I like how it functions like a tray when I'm getting ready with limited counter space.\n\nI take magnesium each night before bed so I brought a week's worth, which fit in one Small Capsule. I take a few other medications as needed, so I brought two extra small Capsules as back up.\n\nInstead I ended up using them for my jewelry, and — if we can be real — they work well for storing cannabis buds, too. I'm also thinking ahead on how to use them in summer, and I think they'd be great for storing herbs and spices when camping. They're not technically food-safe (but only because companies can either be certified for ocean-bound plastic or food-safe, not both).\n\nA big reason Cadense Capsules are so expensive is because they're made with recycled plastics. It's a costly, laborious process to source recycled plastic and give it a whole new shape, color, and purpose. Cadence claims it uses 20% ocean-bound plastics to form its TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane), the same of which Nike uses. The AAPI, woman-led company also keeps it fulfillment and design teams local, so you're paying for an ethically-made product.\n\nMy dream for the next big innovation in travel accessories is a method that doesn't waste all my expensive hair products. Cadence offers Adapters (which notably, are also quite expensive) to help pour in fluids without spilling, but I hate the fact that I'm wasting even a minuscule amount of my curl defining cream.\n\nThat said, the Capsules never leaked on me once. Plus, the curved Spatula made it easy to scoop out every hard-to-reach drop of product. And since every Capsule is labeled with its fluid ounce capacity, you can rest assured you're packing according to strict airline requirements.\n\nIf you're a frequent flier who packs a lot of medications, then I say a Cadence Capsule system is worth the splurge. I rarely feel this put-together when I'm traveling, but the sleek, customizable design has put me in control of all my odds and ends. \n\nI didn't find them particularly helpful as someone who struggles the most with packing fluids, but the Cadence Capsules are really satisfying to use and look at. Even though they're pricier than almost any alternative, the aesthetic is unmatched.",

    "description": "Sales of the Cybertruck were far below the 250,000 annual target Musk set before the electric pickup rolled off the production line in 2023.",
    "fullText": "The Cybertruck is running out of road.\n\nTesla sold 20,237 Cybertrucks in the US last year, according to data from Cox Automotive released on Tuesday, as demand for Elon Musk's \"apocalypse-proof\" pickup fizzled.\n\nThat's nearly half the number Tesla sold in 2024, and sales dropped 68% year-on-year in the final quarter of 2025.\n\nThe figures are a far cry from the target of 250,000 sales a year Musk set before the Cybertruck rolled off the production line in 2023.\n\nThe divisive electric truck amassed over 1 million reservations, but early models launched with a price tag of over $79,000, significantly higher than the nearly $40,000 sticker price Musk had floated in 2019.\n\nSince then, demand has been underwhelming — and collapsing sales have not been the only speed bump.\n\nThe Cybertruck has faced a series of quality issues, with 10 recalls since 2023.\n\nWhile some of those issues have been fixed with a simple software update, others have proved more problematic. Tesla has issued recalls for accelerator pedals that could get trapped at full throttle, an optional off-road light bar that may detach and fly off the truck, and the Cybertruck's comically large windshield wiper failing.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cybertruck's highly distinctive design, which caused Tesla significant production issues, has had the unintended effect of turning the angular EV into a target.\n\nMultiple Cybertruck owners told Business Insider last March that they had been hit by vandalism and verbal harassment amid the backlash over Tesla CEO Musk's federal cost-cutting at the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nTesla has employed some creative strategies for turning around the Cybertruck's sales slump.\n\nBusiness Insider's Grace Kay reported in April that the EV giant was quietly rebranding the futuristic pickup as a working man's truck. And SpaceX, Musk's rocket company, has taken delivery of an unspecified number of Cybertrucks.\n\nUnlike Tesla's other vehicles, however, the Cybertruck is only available in a limited number of countries.\n\nTesla sells the pickup in Mexico and Canada, and recently started sales in Korea, but the Cybertruck's hulking stainless-steel body and sharp edges make it almost impossible to sell in Europe and China, two of the EV giant's largest markets.\n\nTesla also launched the Cybertruck in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar last year — three oil-rich nations where chargers are scarce, and EV sales are low.\n\nThe Cybertruck's woes mean it is unlikely to help Tesla turn around its global sales slump. Sales of all Tesla vehicles declined for the second consecutive year in 2025, with Chinese rival BYD surpassing it to become the world's biggest EV maker.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a Business Insider request for comment.\n\nMusk is not the only one to see ambitious plans for big electric pickups fall flat.\n\nFord sold just over 27,000 of its flagship F-150 Lightning electric truck in 2025 and last month announced that it would replace the EV with an extended-range hybrid offering 700 miles of range.\n\nOther automakers have also backed away from electric pickups as an \"EV winter\" has taken hold in the US following the end of the $7,500 tax credit.\n\nStellantis canceled plans to build an all-electric RAM truck in September, while Ford and GM have signalled they plan to build more gas-powered pickups as they rack up billions of dollars in charges over their EV strategy shifts.\n\nWhat the future holds for the Cybertruck is unclear. Tesla quietly removed the option to buy a cheaper, rear-wheel drive trim from its website after just five months in September, and there has been no word on mooted plans to build a smaller version of the truck, which still starts at around $80,000 in the US.\n\nPublicly, Musk doesn't seem bothered by the Cybertruck's low sales, regularly praising the stainless-steel truck on his X feed.\n\n\"Cybertruck is an incredible vehicle. Our best ever from Tesla,\" he wrote last month.",

    "title": "10 Hacks Every Gmail User Should Know",
    "description": "The easiest ways to tame your inbox.",
    "fullText": "I've used my main Gmail account for about 20 years now, and I'm quite proud of how I've maintained it. My inbox isn't overflowing with unread emails, my storage has never been full, and I've set up hundreds of filters to directly send useless emails right to the trash. I don't use any third-party tools to tame that chaos, and I'm here to share all the hacks I've set up to keep my Gmail inbox under control.\n\nYou should start clearing out your inbox by looking at all of your email newsletter subscriptions. In the past, I've been guilty of subscribing to way too many newsletters and cluttering my inbox. What started out as a great way to read interesting things has ended up as yet another chore that I just cannot keep up with. At some point, you've got to let those unread newsletters go. You can start by manually unsubscribing from the newsletters you're not going to read. Alternatively, you can move these subscriptions to a different email address, so you can keep one inbox just for reading.\n\nYou can also try using read-later apps to receive and read your newsletters. I'm using Readwise Reader these days, and it's allowed me to read so much more than I did when these emails were ending up in my email inbox. If your problem is that you're subscribed to too many promotional emails that are basically junk, then you can also consider using Gmail's built-in tools to unsubscribe from promotional mailing lists.\n\nGmail has powerful filters that can automatically delete unwanted emails. Yes, you can select a bunch of emails and click the Report spam button to get rid of them. This moves those emails to spam, but I've sometimes seen recurring emails from the same sender still finding their way into my inbox, even after doing this. So I've started using Gmail's filters to banish repeat spammers to the trash. You can do this by selecting a bunch of unwanted emails from different senders you don't want to hear from anymore, and then clicking the three-dots button in Gmail's web view. Then, choose Filter messages like these, and Gmail will automatically populate the filter list with all those senders. Select Search, and on the next pop-up, check Delete it, and Also apply filter to matching conversations. Finally, select Create filter.\n\nThis will automatically move all emails from those senders to trash, and prevent more of their emails from ending up in your inbox.\n\nWhen your inbox is already full, or close to it, you should try a few search filters to spot the emails occupying the maximum amount of space in your inbox. The most useful one is the \"Size\" filter. For instance, in Gmail's search bar, you can type Size:20m, and the results will zero in on emails above 20mb in size. Replace the number with 15, 10, or any other number, and it'll show you emails above that size. You can back up these emails if they have anything useful in them, and if not, you can go ahead and delete them all.\n\nI am quite embarrassed to admit that when I was younger, I sent all my friends and family members way too many forwards. My inbox still has forwards from that time, quite a few of which I'd also sent to over 50 people in one go. I may have been responsible for a lot junk mail, but it's never too late to atone for your sins. If you click the three lines icon to the right of the search bar in Gmail, you'll see the service's advanced search options. You can use those options to look for emails from specific date ranges and get rid of ancient clutter that's no longer useful (after you're done cringing, that is). Alternatively, you can just use a search filter to find those emails. Try something like after:2006/1/1 before:2007/1/2 to locate all your emails sent in 2006.\n\nUsing advanced search tools is easier than filters, because it doesn't require you to remember various search operators. It also makes more of those search tools accessible, which makes it a great way to delete old emails from your inbox. If only I could delete them from other people's inboxes, too.\n\nAt a certain point, it does get tiring to keep adding filters to your Gmail to keep useless emails away. I strongly recommend looking at the settings menus on various websites to stop the spam at the source. Social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn are some of the most popular senders of emails nobody asked for. If you go through their communication preferences pages, you'll be able to stop quite a few of their emails before they ever make it to your inbox. I make it a point to uncheck all emails from every site I Once you've done that, these sites might still find a way to send you more emails, but you can click the unsubscribe button (usually present next to unwanted emails in the Social or Promotions tabs) to stop them pretty easily, or just use Gmail's filters to block those emails from ever making it to your eyes.\n\nYou can have Gmail help you sort out unwanted emails from your inbox. Next to each email in your inbox, you'll see a small right-arrow icon. When you see an important email, you can click the arrow icon, which will turn yellow. This marks the email as important, and over time, Gmail will keep those emails in your inbox, and send the rest to other folders.\n\nGmail is pretty good at automatically blocking spam, which means that a lot of unwanted emails will end up in your Spam folder. Similarly, if you've been following the steps described above, you'll have a bunch of emails in your Trash folder. This is helpful, but you won't see any real changes to your Gmail storage space until you clear out all those emails. To do this, manually go to these folders, select all the emails you want to get rid of, and delete them all. Don't forget to check if you're deleting any important emails, because emails deleted from these folders cannot be retrieved.\n\nAlso be sure to check on these folders at least once a month, because Google will automatically delete any messages that have been sitting in them for more than 30 days.\n\nGmail offers an easy built-in way to identify what's occupying the most space in your inbox. To get started, visit the storage cleanup page and click Clean up space. It'll show you some suggestions and offer easy ways to clear out the clutter in your Gmail. You just have to follow the on-screen steps to actually go through with it.\n\nMy colleague David Nield's tip about turning emails into tasks has helped me a lot. When you open an email, you can click the Add to Tasks button up top, which adds it to Google Tasks, and turns that email into a to-do item. This helps me keep track of emails that would otherwise get lost. This way, I can easily save the most important emails and delete the rest. So much of cleaning up Gmail clutter revolves around active email management, and this tip just helps me quickly get rid of useless emails on a day-to-day basis.\n\nNormally, I'm loath to recommend third-party services to manage email chaos. This is because using them means you need to give the companies that make them access to your inbox, which is a privacy and security nightmare. However, I've previously used SaneBox to help a friend get their inbox down from 50,000 unreads to about 10,000 within a day, while also setting up ways to keep their inbox from getting overloaded again too. It's been vetted by Google and Leviathan Security Group, which means I can pretty confidently recommend at least this service. Lifehacker's sister site PCMag also gave Sanebox a glowing review.\n\nYou can try the service for free using the 14-day trial. During that time, you can use its email deep clean feature to quickly get rid of a bunch of your unwanted emails.",

    "description": "Take your route planning to the next level.",
    "fullText": "Google Maps is the only navigation service I use, and I've learned many of its tricks over the years. The default settings do a good enough job for most people, but it's worth reviewing all of its features to ensure that you're getting exactly what you need. For instance, avoiding tolls may be great where you live, but if you're driving in a different state or country, that same feature could land you in some serious trouble. These tips will help you make the most of Google Maps' many features, and reduce the chances of losing your way while using the app.\n\nEven if you ignore everything else in this article, don't ignore this. I've observed that, sometimes, Google Maps automatically enables route options I did not select, which can lead to some sticky situations. Whenever I'm on a long road trip to unknown destinations, I like to double-check route settings before I head out. To do this, tap the profile icon in the top-right corner in the Google Maps app, and go to Settings > Navigation > Route options. This has four options: Avoid tolls, Avoid highways, Avoid ferries, and Prefer fuel-efficient routes. I like to disable all of these to ensure that I reach my destination safely and quickly.\n\nIf you're in an area you know fairly well, you can enable some of these options to find a cheaper route, or one with less traffic. But in unfamiliar territory, I prefer to play it safe.\n\nI often travel to places with poor or no cellular signal, and Google Maps' offline mode has been a lifesaver in these locations. It lets you download Google Maps data for specific locations, and I've set up the app to automatically download and update this data when new information becomes available. This makes it a lot easier to navigate when the internet disappears.\n\nYou can easily do this by searching for a destination on Google Maps and swiping left on the controls that appear below its name. Tap More > Download offline map > Download to save it for offline use. To automatically update offline maps, go to your Google maps settings and select Offline. Now hit the gear icon in the top-right corner and select Auto-update offline maps.\n\nGoogle Maps shows you better search results and improves recommendations for fuel-efficient routes if you choose the correct type of vehicle. Go to your Google Maps settings and navigate to Your vehicles. Select the correct engine type for your vehicle to ensure better recommendations. If you're using an EV, you can also use this page to set the type of charger it uses. This helps Google Maps send you to compatible EV charging stations when you're out and about.\n\nIf you often stream music while driving, you should consider connecting your streaming accounts with Google Maps, which supports both Apple Music and Spotify. Once you've connected the navigation app with either of these services, you'll be able to control music playback and choose playlists from your library, all without leaving the Google Maps app. I don't recommend looking at your phone when you're driving, but you can use this feature to control playback or quickly change songs while your car's stopped. It's a lot faster than switching to a different app to change music.\n\nSome of you will prefer to use voice assistants to do this, but on an iPhone in particular, I haven't had much luck with using Siri to change music. That's why I've connected my streaming accounts to Google Maps instead.\n\nGoogle Maps can highlight accessibility information for you. This can be extremely helpful if you're traveling with people who have mobility challenges or are living with disabilities. I never thought much about these options until I started traveling with my senior citizen parents, who can no longer climb lots of stairs or stand for long hours. That's why I went to the Google Maps settings, navigated to App & display, and enabled Emphasize accessibility info. This feature prominently shows if a destination has accessible entrances, seating, reserved parking spots, and if restrooms are available (and accessible), etc.\n\nNote that this information isn't always accurate, so if accessibility is your top priority, I still recommend calling ahead to confirm if your destination's accessible features are available and in working order. Similarly, when you're using walking directions to get somewhere, try tapping the options button, which is next to the share icon. This will reveal the Trip options page, where you can select Wheelchair accessible to avoid routes with stairs and choose ones that have elevators instead.\n\nI use Google Maps a lot while I'm walking around, and I have a few tips to make it easier to find where you're going. The first is to use Google Maps when you're wearing an Apple Watch or an Android smartwatch, if you have one. Google Maps buzzes your watch when you have a direction coming up, and you can quickly look at the watch to see which way to go. With this, I don't have to keep looking at my phone for directions. This approach worked really well on a recent trip to Singapore in rainy weather, where it wasn't always possible to keep looking at my phone while also holding my water bottle and umbrella.\n\nYou can also use Live View to get even more detailed walking directions. It uses your phone's camera to identify shops, signs, and other landmarks near you. Then, it gives you directions in a camera view, which is like a live video walkthrough taking you to your destination. This makes it great for navigating indoors, like in airports or malls.\n\nWhen you review listings on Google Maps, or make other contributions, others may be able to view your profile and all your ratings, reviews, photos, and other contributions. If you don't want this information to be visible, you can make your profile private on Google Maps. To do this, go to Google Maps settings > Location & privacy > Profile and enable Restricted profile.\n\nGoogle Maps also keeps track of all the places you've visited, and not everyone is comfortable storing that data on Google's servers. Now, I should say that this information is legitimately useful sometimes. Once, a friend's car was wrongly sent a speeding ticket from a different state. He was able to use his Google Maps timeline data to prove to law enforcement that he was, in fact, not in that state at the time.\n\nHaving said that, you'll be able to better preserve your privacy by not storing this information in the first place. To do that, go to Google Maps settings > Location & privacy. Review all the options in the Timeline section to see what fits your preferences. I've switched off Timeline entirely, and I also chose Delete all Timeline data, but your needs may be different, so you may choose to delete a specific range of timeline data or automatically delete it after a certain period of time instead.\n\nTo delete your search history from Google Maps, scroll down on this page and select Maps history.\n\nIf deleting your Google Maps data permanently isn't the ideal solution for you, then you may want to try incognito mode instead. This works exactly like it does in web browsers, meaning that it won't save your Google Maps data as long as you're in that mode. You can enable it by tapping the profile icon in Google Maps and selecting Turn on incognito mode. You can check if it's enabled by looking at the profile icon, where your picture will be replaced by the incognito icon.\n\nIf you have trouble remembering all of the trips you want to take, you can quickly save your favorites in Google Maps, and add them to various lists. For instance, if you're planning a trip to Florida and you want to save all of the destinations you've heard about in one spot, you can look for each one individually on Google Maps and hit the Save button on their listings. This lets you save the destination to a new list, where you can keep a tab on all the places you want to go to. You can also share these lists with others, and everyone can add the places they're interested in to your list, too. I used this feature during my London trip last year, where I bookmarked restaurants that served authentic fare from around the world. It allowed me to taste food that I'd never tried before, and helped me better organize my daily plan to fit a couple of museums or other attractions around my meals.",

    "description": "Copyright doesn't last forever.",
    "fullText": "I love movies, and especially when I can watch them for free: And while streaming the latest Hollywood blockbusters might come at a price (at least for those wanting to stay on the right side of the law), there's an ever-growing collection of older films that you can get at online without paying a dime.\n\nThe site WikiFlix (as spotted by the fine folks at Gizmodo) lists movies available to stream that are now in the public domain. The way that copyright works in the U.S. basically means that copyright expires on films after a period of 95 years—so with every year that passes, a batch of new flicks become available to view by anyone, free of charge.\n\nIf you're looking for something classic for your next movie night, it's well worth a look.\n\nWikiFlix is straightforward to use, right from the homepage. It tracks films added to sites such as Wikimedia Commons, YouTube, and the Internet Archive, and whenever you click through on a movie, you can also see where it has come from. When you've made your pick, it streams right in your browser window.\n\nThe home page is split up into categories that you can browse through—including female directions, animations, and biographical films, the last time I checked—and there's also a search button up in the top right corner if you know what you're looking for. Next to the search button is an account button, which enables you to \n\nHover over the main WikiFlix heading at the top of the page and a quick link to Movies by year pops up. This is a useful way of finding the most recent flicks added to WikiFlix, and digging back into the archive—not all of the movies here are in the public domain because their copyright has expired, and you will find more recent titles too.\n\nClick through on any thumbnail to get more information about each movie. You can typically get information on the director, cast, and running time, and a plot summary is included too. Some of the entries come with trailers (although you can also search for these separately on sites like YouTube).\n\nStart streaming a movie, and the usual playback controls appear, though the interface does depend to some extent on the site that's hosting the movie. For films hosted on YouTube, for example, you can typically adjust the playback quality and speed. Some movies come with subtitles too.\n\nObviously a site like this is going to skew towards older, classic movies, but there's plenty to explore here: Metropolis, It's a Wonderful Life, All Quiet on the Western Front, Nosferatu, Charlie Chaplin comedy The Gold Rush, and lots more.\n\nFree movie repositories aren't quite as rare online as you might think. We've written before about the best free and legal streaming services for movies and TV, featuring ad-supported streaming platforms such as Tubi and PlutoTV. Again, the emphasis is on older films, but there's a huge amount on offer at no charge.",

I was scrolling on my feed, when all of a sudden, new posts wouldn't load, and I was greeted by an option to refresh. When I did, the site reloaded, but now without any posts—only the futile option to try reloading again.\n\nYou can see a steep spike in user reports on Downdetector (which, for full disclosure, is owned by Lifehacker parent company Ziff Davis). At the time of writing, roughly 25,000 users had reported issues with X, I among them.\n\nThere are a number of potential reasons why X won't load this morning, but it doesn't appear to be a larger issue with a cloud hosting service. Anytime a major website like X goes down, it harkens back to global outages, stemming from issues with cloud hosting services like AWS and Cloudflare. However, a quick check on Downdetector shows me that few other sites and services are having massive outage reports at the moment. That could change, but as of this article, it seems like X's issues are their own.\n\nX will no doubt get things back up and running soon. In the meantime, maybe it's best for all of us to get off the site for a change.",

    "title": "A gRPC Transport for the Model Context Protocol",
    "description": "An alternative to MCP transcoding is gRPC, and Google Cloud is working with MCP maintainers to support pluggable transports in the MCP SDK.",
    "fullText": "Our most intelligent model is now available on Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise\n\nAI agents are moving from test environments to the core of enterprise operations, where they must interact reliably with external tools and systems to execute complex, multi-step goals. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the standard that makes this agent to tool communication possible. In fact, just last month we announced the release of fully-managed, remote MCP servers. Developers can now simply point their AI agents or standard MCP clients like Gemini CLI to a globally-consistent and enterprise-ready endpoint for Google and Google Cloud services.\n\nMCP uses JSON-RPC as its standard transport. This brings many benefits as it combines an action-oriented approach with natural language payloads that can be directly relayed by agents in their communication with foundational models. Yet many organizations rely on gRPC, a high-performance, open source implementation of the remote procedure call (RPC) model. Enterprises that have adopted the gRPC framework must adapt their tooling to be compatible with the JSON-RPC transport used by MCP. Today, these enterprises need to deploy transcoding gateways to translate between JSON-RPC MCP requests and their existing gRPC-based services.\n\nAn interesting alternative to MCP transcoding is to use gRPC as the native transport for MCP. Many gRPC users are actively experimenting with this option by implementing their own custom MCP servers. At Google Cloud, we use gRPC extensively to enable services and offer APIs at a global scale, and we’re committed to sharing the technology and expertise that has resulted from this pervasive use of gRPC. Specifically, we’re committed to supporting gRPC practitioners in their journey to adopt MCP in production, and we’re actively working with the MCP community to explore mechanisms to support gRPC as a transport for MCP. The MCP core maintainers have arrived at an agreement to support pluggable transports in the MCP SDK, and in the near future, Google Cloud will contribute and distribute a gRPC transport package to be plugged into the MCP SDKs. A community-backed transport package will enable gRPC practitioners to deploy MCP with gRPC in a consistent and interoperable manner.\n\nThe native use of gRPC as a transport avoids the need for transcoding and helps maintain operational consistency for environments that are actively using gRPC. In the rest of this post, we explore the benefits of using gRPC as a native transport for MCP and how Google Cloud is supporting this journey.\n\nFor organizations already using gRPC for their services, native gRPC support allows them to continue to use their existing tooling to access services via MCP without altering the services or implementing transcoding proxies. These organizations are on a journey to keep the benefits of gRPC as MCP becomes the mechanism for agents to access services.\n\n“Because gRPC is our standard protocol in the backend, we have invested in experimental support for MCP over gRPC internally. And we already see the benefits: ease of use and familiarity for our developers, and reducing the work needed to build MCP servers by using the structure and statically typed APIs.” -  Stefan Särne, Senior Staff Engineer and Tech Lead for Developer Experience, Spotify\n\nUsing gRPC as a native transport aligns MCP with the best practices of modern gRPC-based distributed systems, improving performance, security, operations, and developer productivity.\n\nThe performance advantages of gRPC provide a big boost in efficiency, thanks to the following attributes:\n\nBinary encoding (protocol buffers): gRPC uses protocol buffers (Protobufs) for binary encoding, shrinking message sizes by up to 10x compared to JSON. This means less bandwidth consumption and faster serialization/deserialization, which translates to lower latency for tool calls, reduced network costs, and a much smaller resource footprint.\n\nFull duplex bidirectional streaming: gRPC natively supports the client (the agent) and the server (the tool), sending continuous data streams to each other simultaneously over a single, persistent connection. This feature is a game-changer for agent-tool interaction, opening the door to truly interactive, real-time agentic workflows without requiring application-level connection synchronization.\n\nBuilt-in flow control (backpressure): gRPC includes native flow control to prevent a fast-sending tool from overwhelming the agent.\n\nEnterprise-grade security and authorization\n\ngRPC treats security as a first-class citizen, with enterprise-grade features built directly into its core, including:\n\nMutual TLS (mTLS): Critical for Zero Trust architectures, mTLS authenticates both the client and the gRPC-powered server, preventing spoofing and helping to ensure only trusted services communicate.\n\nStrong authentication: gRPC offers native hooks for integrating with industry-standard token-based authentication (JWT/OAuth), providing verifiable identity for every AI agent.\n\nMethod-level authorization: You can enforce authorization policies directly on specific RPC methods or MCP tools (e.g., an agent is authorized to ReadFile but not DeleteFile), helping to ensure strict adherence to the principle of least privilege and combating \"excessive agency.\"\n\nOperational maturity and developer productivity\n\ngRPC provides a powerful, integrated solution that helps offload resiliency measures and improves developer productivity through extensibility and reusability. Some of its capabilities include:\n\nUnified observability: Native integration with distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) and structured error codes provides a complete, auditable trail of every tool call. Developers can trace a single user prompt through every subsequent microservice interaction.\n\nRobust resiliency: Features like deadlines, timeouts, and automatic flow control prevent a single unresponsive tool from causing system-wide failures. These features allow a client to specify a policy for a tool call that the framework automatically cancels if exceeded, preventing a cascading failure.\n\nPolyglot development: gRPC generates code for 11+ languages, allowing developers to implement MCP Servers in the best language for the job while maintaining a consistent, strongly-typed contract.\n\nSchema-based input validation: Protobuf's strict typing mitigates injection attacks and simplifies the development task by rejecting malformed inputs at the serialization layer.\n\nError handling and metadata: The framework provides a standardized set of error codes (e.g., UNAVAILABLE, PERMISSION_DENIED) for reliable client handling, and clients can send and receive out-of-band information as key-value pairs in metadata (e.g., for tracing IDs) without cluttering the main request.\n\nAs a founding member of the Agentic AI Foundation and a core contributor to the MCP specification, Google Cloud, along with other members of the community, has championed the inclusion of pluggable transport interfaces in the MCP SDK.

    "description": "Explore and Exploit are two operating modes that need to be blended for a particular activity.",
    "fullText": "Manage the Tension Between Adaptation and Optimization\n\nMany teams have turned into tribes wedded to exclusively adaptation\n or optimization. But this misses the point that both of these are important,\n and we need to manage the tension between them. We can do this by thinking of\n two operating modes: explore (adaptation-dominant) and exploit\n (optimization dominant). We tailor a team's operating model to a particular\n blend of the two - considering uncertainty, risk, cost\n of change, and an evidence threshold. We should be particularly careful at the\n points where there is a handoff between the two modes\n\nJim has worked across just about every role in tech—from coding and\n product design to senior management and executive consulting. He's\n co-founded agile communities, written six books, co-authored the Agile\n Manifesto, and spent a lifetime exploring how people lead through\n uncertainty. He's now in “soft-retirement”.\n\nI like Agile. I like discipline. I like systems that ship and systems\n that learn.\n\nIn the last couple decades, many teams camped at the ends of a\n spectrum:\n\n uncertainty.\n\n constraints.\n\nThe mistake is treating either one as a permanent operating mode.\n\nThe adult question is: what should dominate right now?\n\nThis is a tension to manage, not a side to pick.\n\nSoftware teams have lived inside this tension for years.\n\nNow more industries hit the same wall—fast.\n\nLife sciences (Biotech) provides clear examples. Tools like CRISPR\n (gene editing), AlphaFold (3-D protein folding) and other AI-assisted\n discovery models compress early cycles.\n\nCRISPR‑based tools aided COVID‑19 research and target discovery, while\n platform technologies like mRNA and viral vectors were the key enablers of\n the one‑year vaccine timeline. AlphaFold can often do in hours on a\n computer what used to take months or years in the lab.\n\nUsing these tools teams can explore more options, faster. That sounds\n like pure upside—until you remember the other side of the tension:\n downstream work gets more expensive, more constrained, and less\n forgiving.\n\nFaster learning does not remove constraints. It raises the cost of\n sloppy decisions.\n\nSo the capability gap shifts. It’s no longer “Can we “do” Agile?” It’s:\n Can we manage the Adaptation ↔ Optimization tension on purpose—at\n speed?\n\nI use two modes as a practical shorthand. They are not philosophies.\n They are operating patterns.\n\nPurpose: reduce uncertainty fast.\n\nExplore mode treats work as a series of hypotheses.\n\nExplore mode does not mean chaos. It means you optimize the\n learning loop.\n\nPurpose: reduce variance under constraints.\n\nExploit mode treats work as a system you must run reliably.\n\nExploit mode does not mean bureaucracy. It means you optimize\n reliability.\n\nDominance keeps you out of religion.\n\nUsing the words explore and exploit often brings to mind Kent Beck’s\n explore–expand–extract. That connection is useful.\n\nI see expand as the bridge state where a promising signal moves from\n cheap learning to scaled evidence.\n\nIn expand, you do three things at once:\n\nExpand is where many orgs pay the highest handoff tax, because teams\n keep explore behaviors while the work now demands exploit discipline.\n\nMost programs don’t fail inside a phase.\n\nI call the hidden cost at seams the handoff tax:\n\nIf you want speed, cut handoff tax. It beats “doing Agile harder.”\n\nOne early “solution” to this tension was bimodal IT: put exploratory\n work in one lane and stable delivery in another—frequently as separate\n organizational units.\n\nIn practice it turned into warring tribes. One side became the\n innovation heroes. The other became the stability police. Decisions\n bounced between them, handoff tax exploded, and leaders tried to manage\n conflict instead of designing the work.\n\nThe lesson: you can’t outsource this tension to an org chart. The\n capability has to live in every person who makes decisions—from team\n members to executives.\n\nIn 2004–2006 I worked with Sciex, an ISO-certified mass spectrometry\n instrument firm. A crash in the middle of a sample run can ruin an\n experiment and waste irreplaceable samples.\n\nAfter a year plus working with software teams we tackled a daunting\n project–development of a new mass spec instrument.\n\nWe found the big killer to be integration debt (handoff tax)—the pain\n you store up when hardware, firmware, and software converge late.\n\nISO requirements kept governance real. So we avoided a false\n choice.\n\nThen the Director of Product Development pushed a simple shift:\n\nThat is dominance tuning in the wild:\n\nIf you want dominance without debates, use dials.\n\nTurn the dials, set dominance, then design the workflow to match.\n\nTwo common failures: slow learning and messy evidence.\n\nTwo common failures: false certainty and late integration.\n\nTwo common failures: compliance theater and hidden workarounds.\n\nSpeed and accountability need clear decision rights. This is not\n hierarchy worship.\n\nMany orgs reach for RACI:Responsible, Accountable, Consulted,\n Informed. In practice, RACI often turns decisions into calendar sludge\n and polite vetoes.\n\nUse DARE instead: Deciders, Advisors, Recommenders, Execution\n stakeholders.\n\nDARE keeps “servant leadership” and “self-organizing” (and their\n cousins: “empowered teams,” “decentralized decisions”) from sliding into\n soft anarchy: you can give more people a voice without giving everyone a\n vote.\n\nDARE works at every level—from a product team to the CEO staff—because\n the pattern stays the same:\n\nDARE saves autonomy from turning into consensus-by-exhaustion.\n\nMany teams treat tailoring like weight loss: start with a big method,\n cut steps, hope speed shows up.\n\nReal tailoring means design for fit:\n\nTailoring also demands judgment, and judgment stays scarce. You can buy\n tools and templates. You can’t buy discernment at scale.\n\nStop selling “Agile vs Traditional.” That story sells the problem.\n\nWhere do you pay the highest handoff tax today—and which dial would\n you turn first?\n\n13 January 2026: Put into toolchain",

    "description": "Speed vs. Control. I reverse-engineered a Flourish chart to show why custom data visualisation is worth the 14-hour struggle over a 15-minute template.",
    "fullText": "I spent 14 hours creating a custom data visualisation (a recreation of a template that took 15 minutes to customise). Why? We’ll get to that later.\n\nBut for now, it means you can get a behind-the-scenes peek of how your favourite data visuals get built.\n\nI might not have created your favourite ever data story. Whether it’s the BBC’s “Find out about hospital waiting times in your area this winter”, or the areas of deprivation data story (FT paywall, but first to publish, BBC, later, but accessible to all), or my still all-time personal favourite, (okay my second favourite) The Pudding’s Women’s Pockets are Inferior 1My all-time favourite is Vox’s “Every time Ford and Kavanaugh dodged a question, in one chart” which elegantly captures in one visual how many times Brett Kavanaugh dodged the question in his controversial Senate testimony. However, it’s disappeared on Vox’s website (which is now paywalled), and web archive links don’t capture the interactive visual. Alas, the ephemeral nature of the web. I thought things were supposed to live forever on the internet?\n\nBut I do know what goes into making them. And I’ve been reverse-engineering a chart of mine built with an off-the-shelf tool (Flourish) and replicating it in D3.JS\n\nI grabbed “snapshots”2Git commits, really. as through this journey. You can view its progress from raw and ugly to its first presentable form…and it isn’t even finished (it’s static instead of interactive):\n\nMy first goal was to recreate a static, no animations or transitions, version of my original Flourish chart. This took about 14 days of early morning coding sessions. Most of this is because this is my first work-from-scratch project in D3.\n\nHere is the original flourish chart for reference.\n\nTime taken: (Once I had the data) – Excluding the 500+ hours of experience I have working with Flourish, or the 2-5 hours I spent making my brand templates (excluding the brand research)… 15 minutes.\n\nThis is the first step, a lot happens behind the scenes. The HTML and JavaScript structure is built. The data is read and reformatted in JavaScript, and there is a lot of testing with the web console to ensure the data is outputting exactly the way one wants. Transforming flat CSVs into nested JSON hierarchies…is let’s just say a character-building exercise.\n\nBut hey a visual milestone: some axes!\n\nWe start to have something that looks somewhat like the original. Squiggly lines, and they have the same colours as the original.\n\nLabels. There was a wasted rabbit hole trying to space them out like the original – but the technicalities of using the d3-force module are beyond the scope of this project.\n\nExecution requires trade-offs. Perfectionism is the art of loving the beginning….because you never have to do the messy trade offs required to get to done. But perfectionists don’t ship, “real artists ship”.3Steve Jobs FYI.\n\nBut we have labels, and they’re placed in more strategic places in the chart itself than the original. Something that couldn’t be done with flourish.\n\nMaking London and England dashed required more wrangling (did I tell you working with JSONs is fun? I hope you can hear the sarcasm through the screen), than I expected – but I’m satisfied with the result.\n\nIt looks similar to the original, with a few tweaks in label placement, and adapting the font-style to my website’s brand. Tweaks that were impossible with Flourish.\n\nTotal time taken to get here: 12-14 hours\n\nSo why bother spending 14 hours coding a custom data visualisation that I could build in 15 minutes with an off-the-shelf tool?\n\nForgetting the fact that you need to go slow to go fast, to get a fingertip feel, to be able to build your intuition – why is this of benefit if you want deliverables?\n\nBecause tools like Flourish, Tableau, or Power BI are rented land. What you gain in speed, you lose in control. If you want a chart that perfectly matches a brand’s font, snaps exactly the way you want on a mobile screen, or tells a story exactly how you envision it – that will move people the way you desire, not the way a template constrains you – you have to build it yourself.\n\nAnd use those lessons in delivering what will do the job.\n\nI’m doing a bigger write-up on what I learned from this project. About the relationship between art, struggle, and deliberate practice…all via data visualisation.\n\nSign up below to get first access when it’s out (you’ll also instantly get my three-part data-essay: London’s Affordability Crisis).\n\nThis project taught me a lot about the relationship between struggle, mastery, and art.

That is why we have surged enforcement activity to the highest level in British history so illegal migrants in the black economy have nowhere to hide.”\n\nChris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: “This is yet another pathetic gimmick that won’t work. The idea that putting some posts on TikTok will stop illegal immigrants is laughable – just like the government’s previous gimmick to smash the gangs.”",

    "fullText": "PM says he is alarmed at reports about children’s screen time and has shifted position on Australian-style policy\n\nUK politics live – latest updates\n\nKeir Starmer has told MPs he is open to the idea of an Australian-style ban on social media for young people after becoming concerned about the amount of time children and teenagers are spending on their phones.\n\nThe prime minister told Labour MPs on Monday evening he had become alarmed at reports about five-year-olds spending hours in front of screens each day, as well as increasingly worried about the damage social media is doing to under-16s.\n\nStarmer has previously opposed banning social media for children, believing such a move would be difficult to police and could push teenagers towards the dark web.\n\nHowever with cross-party political support growing for such a ban, the prime minister told a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party that he had shifted his position.\n\n“We are looking at Australia, there are different ways you can enforce it,” he told the meeting.\n\nHe also addressed the use of phones during school time, adding: “No one thinks you should have phones in schools.”\n\nOne minister who attended the meeting said: “It was definitely a change in tone and I think a lot of colleagues will have welcomed it. Keir gave the impression that all options are on the table.”\n\nLast year ministers opposed measures in a private member’s bill by the Labour MP Josh MacAlister which would have forced social media companies to exclude young teenagers from algorithms in an attempt to make their platforms less addictive.\n\nIt would also have committed the government to a review of the sale of phones to teenagers and whether additional technological safeguards should be on phones sold to under-16s.\n\nSince then however, Australia has put its own ban in place, while support has grown across Westminster for such a move in the UK.\n\nKemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, said over the weekend that the Tories would stop under-16s from accessing “addictive” social media, while Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, said he wanted a “cross-party consensus around much bolder action”.\n\nNigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, said he was also open to a social media ban for young people, saying: “Let’s see the Australian experiment, let’s see how it works and let’s make our minds up.”\n\nEd Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, echoed that statement on Tuesday, telling a press conference: “We need to study what’s happened in Australia, this is absolutely the direction of travel.”\n\nOfficials say Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, is also open to the idea of a ban, with a final decision expected within months.\n\nWes Streeting, the health secretary, told the BBC last week: “I think the drivers behind Australia’s decision are things we’re worried about here in the UK – whether that’s cyberbullying, whether that’s things like body image and eating disorders and mental ill health, whether that’s the risk of grooming, the risk of people also being groomed into terrorism and serious organised crime, so the dark side of the internet.”",

    "title": "Using Proxies to Hide Secrets from Claude Code",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "Allowlisting commands on a trusted host for an agentic coding tool can be somewhat fraught. Taking inspiration from Simon Willison:\n\nSandboxes help us reason about their relation to the lethal trifecta:\n\nAnthropic provides several sandboxing tools specific to Claude Code:\n\nCursor also has a similar sandboxing feature for Mac users that uses sandbox-exec under the hood for the Cursor IDE. OpenAI’s Codex CLI also supports a sandbox argument that uses sandbox-exec. We’re super excited to see all the new tools to limit what access these agentic coding tools have to our host!\n\nYou could also write your own sandbox using gVisor or Firecracker VMs! The themes around network isolation and proxies should transfer.\n\nAlthough the specifics of the sandbox technology affect the level of isolation, a sufficiently sandboxed Claude Code can make a sandboxed Claude Code look like a separate host.\n\nFor example, almost all Claude Code instances have access to Anthropic API keys to be able to interact with the Anthropic API.\n\nClaude Code has access to all environment variables present in your terminal session (which are propagated to the Claude Code sandbox), and Claude Code has access to read the files from the directory where you run claude.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of software requires secrets. For example, development on third-party integrations requires using secrets.\n\nThis makes having separate development, staging, and production integration credentials especially valuable, but even development integration credentials are not designed to be publicly accessible: otherwise, they wouldn’t be credentials!\n\nConsider the precedence of dotenv files to manage secrets on your local repo. Making sure that these .env files are properly .gitignored and .dockerignored is no longer sufficient: leaving these .env files in a folder where you are running claude gives Claude Code access to these secrets.\n\nYou could also write your own sandbox using gVisor or Firecracker VMs! The themes around network isolation and proxies should transfer.\n\nThe provided devcontainer template has an init-firewall.sh script that applies a firewall to the devcontainer running Claude Code. This firewall permits network connections to the following hosts by default:\n\nThis firewall is enforced at the IP layer: the init script performs a dig to resolve these hosts’ IP addresses and uses iptables to allow connections to these IPs. This does mean that the particular connection to these hosts is not necessarily enforced at the TLS/HTTP layers; for example, an AWS ALB on an allowlisted IP that routes traffic based on SNI or Host headers could still receive requests that specify different hosts.\n\nIn addition, the firewall supports inbound and outbound traffic to any IP address on port 22 for SSH connections.\n\nThe devcontainer could exfiltrate sensitive data, including credentials, via a\n\nvariety of ways:\n\nEven if we only HTTP traffic to a select set of hosts, this problem remains challenging because of Domain Fronting: there are often a huge diversity of actions you can perform on a single domain. Applying restricted privileges to these kinds of domains at the IP, domain, or even host level is often not fine-grained enough to allow the actions you want to allow and block the actions you want to block. In fact, prompt injection attacks in particular have taken advantage of overly broad domain allowlists to exfiltrate sensitive information!\n\nThe specifics of what kind of network traffic you want to permit and not permit often requires looking at the application layer.\n\nThankfully, Claude Code supports using proxies to route traffic! There are two ways to configure Claude Code to use proxies:\n\nNote that these proxy configurations are independent of each other: the HTTP_PROXY environment variable will not intercept HTTP traffic from bash commands in the sandbox, and the sandbox httpProxyPort will not intercept HTTP traffic from the Claude Code CLI tool that is outside of the sandbox.\n\nYou can configure Claude Code to use an HTTP proxy using the following configuration in settings.json:\n\nmitmproxy is a great tool to run these HTTP proxies. Note: provide the mitmproxy-generated TLS certificate to intercept TLS traffic to Claude for node processes via export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=~/mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem.\n\nThe mitmproxy tool also supports addons where you can transform HTTP requests between Claude Code and third-party web servers. For example, you could write an add-on that intercepts https://api.anthropic.com and updates the X-API-Key header with an actual Anthropic API Key.\n\nYou could then pass an invalid Anthropic API Key to Claude Code so that neither the Claude Code process nor the sandbox has access to our Anthropic API Key!\n\nYou could then run mitmweb with the right API key:\n\nAfterwards, run claude with the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable set to an invalid API key:\n\nFrom the perspective of Claude Code, all API responses from api.anthropic.com will appear to Claude Code as if the API key of sk-ant-dummy is a valid API key!\n\nUnfortunately, Claude Code still requires signing in via OAuth before checking if the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set, so you may have to sign in via OAuth first, grab the API key, close the session, and then start a new claude process with an invalid ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable.\n\nThis kind of technique is not unique to hiding your Anthropic API Keys: you could insert dummy API keys and secrets and use mitmproxy addons to intercept these HTTP requests and inject actual API keys once the request has left the Claude Code process and sandbox.\n\nOur customers use Formal to apply least privilege to both human and machine identities. You can also leverage Formal to decouple human & machine identities from Native Users and apply fine-grained least privilege at the application layer. A lot of the techniques to apply organizational least privilege are relevant for applying least privilege to Claude Code sandboxes: if your organizational permissions are sufficiently constrained, the blast radius of a rogue Claude Code with a developer’s credentials should be small as well.\n\nTo date, Admin Anthropic API Keys inherit the full permissions of the user who created them, and there is no ability to make API keys more fine-grained. API keys generated from the Claude API for Claude Code, however, seem to have restrictions on what API endpoints they are allowed to use, but we have not found documentation on the exact permissions that are allowed versus disabled.\n\nDevelopers may want to use Claude Code to write and run code that uses an Admin Anthropic API Key. If they pass the API Key via an environment variable, the sandbox will have access to this Admin Anthropic API Key. An organization, however, may want to prevent certain API actions from being taken with an Anthropic API Key and have logging on who is performing which API actions. Developers may not notice the distinction as well!\n\nThe best way to prevent Claude Code from leaking an API Key is to make sure that it never has direct access to the credentials in the first place! One can use Formal Connectors, Formal Resources, and Native Users to make sure that Claude Code cannot leak the API Key. That way, Claude Code can make requests to the Connector with Formal-specific credentials and the Connector can inject actual secrets when communicating with the upstream API.\n\nFor hostnames and headers that are hard to tweak, use mitmproxy add-ons to route the HTTP requests for these domains to the corresponding listener.\n\nYou can then pass this add-on via mitmproxy -s reroute_hosts.py.\n\nOne advantage of this approach is that you do not have to configure hostnames and ports for Claude Code: the default hostnames and ports for these APIs will look identical from the perspective of Claude Code.\n\nWe could then create a policy in a similar way to the policy we created for the local Github MCP server use case.\n\nIf we change the path param to “/v1/messages,” we can confirm that this policy is able block requests to the Anthropic API even outside of the Claude Code sandbox:\n\nWe also get visibility into every request being made to the Anthropic API across our organization!\n\nOf course, this technique was not specific to safeguarding Anthropic API Keys: one can use HTTP proxies and Claude Code sandboxes to enforce least privilege for your API Keys even if you want to enable Claude Code to use some of these APIs!\n\nProxies as a result can help in two dimensions of the lethal trifecta:",

The diff might look wrong, but it's actually how you do things. Or the diff looks fine, but it breaks something specific to your setup.\n\nWe made a lot of changes here. Some examples:\n\nRepo context: cubic now automatically reads READMEs, contributing guides, and context files in your repo to understand how things are supposed to work before it comments\n\nLive documentation: cubic smartly reads the correct docs for the lib version you’re using\n\nBetter tooling: improved the tools cubic has access to crawl and fetch the relevant code and files it needs\n\nFiltering: all of this context feeds into filtering out bad flags before they get posted\n\nPRs are iterative. You push, get feedback, fix something, push again. Before, cubic would re-clone and re-analyze everything each time.\n\nNow we cache codebases for a short window. Back-to-back pushes on the same repo skip the clone step entirely. This made reviews a lot faster, especially on bigger repos.\n\nWe compared cubic against other AI code review tools on repos running both.\n\nOn repos running both cubic and CodeRabbit, cubic flags 50% more unique issues that users end up addressing. These are all bugs that users fix that CodeRabbit did not flag at all.\n\nAdditionally, 80% of comments that CodeRabbit posts that cubic doesn't end up not getting addressed by the user.\n\nOn repos running both cubic and Cursor, cubic flags 2x more unique issues that users end up addressing. These are all bugs that users fix that Cursor did not flag at all.\n\nThe data shows cubic catches more of what matters.",

    "fullText": "A Ukrainian brigade has been testing a fishing rod-like device on one of its drones.\n\nThe line attached to the apparatus appears to be for entangling in the propeller of enemy drones.\n\nThe brigade published two interception clips of quadcopters on Monday.\n\nUkrainian troops appear to be testing a new drone attachment that uses a cord or line to disable enemy propeller drones in the sky.\n\nThe tactic can be seen in a video posted on Monday by the 46th Separate Air Mobile Brigade, which published a video montage of its recent attacks against Russian infantry, vehicles, and drones.\n\nIn a caption, the brigade highlighted a \"new way of capture of enemy drones in the air.\"\n\nAs seen from the first-person-view camera of the Ukrainian drone, the new contraption features a rod protruding from the interceptor's chassis.\n\nThin rope or cord dangles from the rod, pulled taut by a small weight that sways into view as the Ukrainian drone flies high above the battlefield.\n\nThe brigade's drone then appears to fly over its target — a small quadcopter — entangling the opposing device's propellers with the attached line.\n\nThe brigade published footage of two such interceptions, as well as a third clip of a drone with the rod-like attachment attempting to crash into a fixed-wing drone.\n\nThe third target was likely a Russian Molniya one-way attack loitering munition. It's unclear if the interception in the third clip was successful.\n\nThe novel, fishing rod-style device is another example of how the war is pushing militaries to develop new methods of physically disrupting drones as electronic warfare technology adapts.\n\nUkrainians and Russians have been experimenting with similar counterdrone tactics as a response to anti-jamming features on small attack drones, deploying fishing nets both on the ground and testing them on interceptors.\n\nSome Western companies have also begun trialing drone-mounted and handheld net launchers as a defense against small quadcopters.\n\nAs Russia increasingly relies on large-scale attacks with fixed-wing Geran drones that typically fly at speeds of up to 115 mph, and in some cases even 230 mph, the war has led to the growing popularity of small, fast, and inexpensive drones acting as interceptors.\n\nThe 46th Separate Air Mobile Brigade's fishing line apparatus, however, appears to be more suited to disabling quadcopters.",

    "description": "Iran's bazaar merchants, the trader class who were the financial backbone of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, have turned against the clerics they helped bring",
    "fullText": "DUBAI, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Iran's bazaar merchants, the trader class who were the financial backbone of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, have turned against the clerics they helped bring to power, fuelling unrest over an economy that has morphed into full-blown anti-government protests.\n\nFrustration among bazaar merchants, from small-scale shopkeepers to large wholesale traders, has grown ​as their political and economic clout in Iran has diminished over the decades while the elite Revolutionary Guards have tightened their grip on the economy, building sprawling and tightly held ‌networks of power.\n\n\"We are struggling. We cannot import goods because of U.S. sanctions and because only the Guards or those linked to them control the economy. They only think about their own benefits,\" said a trader at Tehran’s centuries-old Grand Bazaar, speaking ‌on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe wave of protests that has engulfed the country, posing one of the toughest challenges ever to the clerical leadership, erupted in late December in Tehran's Grand Bazaar, where hundreds of shopkeepers denounced the sharp fall in the rial currency.\n\nThe demonstrations quickly swelled and turned political, challenging the Islamic Republic's legitimacy. Protesters burned images of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and chanted \"Death to the dictator\" - undeterred by security forces armed with tear gas, batons, and, in many cases, live ammunition.\n\nIran’s rulers, while acknowledging economic difficulties, have blamed their longtime foes the U.S. and Israel for fomenting the unrest. They appear intent on holding onto power ⁠at any cost, backed by a security apparatus refined over decades of ‌suppressing ethnic revolts, student movements, and protests over economic hardship and social freedoms.\n\nA combination of international sanctions and the Guards' sprawling economic empire has limited the government's ability to ease the dire economic situation.\n\nTehran-based analyst Saeed Laylaz said the government has lost control over the situation.\n\n\"What is striking is that the unrest began ‍in the bazaar. For merchants, the core issue isn’t inflation - it’s price volatility, which leaves them unable to decide whether to buy or sell,\" he said.\n\nEconomic disparities between ordinary Iranians and the clerical and security elite, along with economic mismanagement and state corruption - reported even by state media - have fanned discontent at a time when inflation is pushing the price of many goods beyond the means of most people.\n\nIran's rial currency has lost nearly half its ​value against the dollar in 2025, with official inflation reaching 42.5% in December.\n\nCONTROL OF SECTORS FROM OIL TO CONSTRUCTION\n\nCreated by the Islamic Republic's late founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Guards first secured ‌an economic foothold after the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, when clerical rulers allowed them to invest in leading Iranian industries.\n\nTheir influence expanded exponentially over decades, benefiting from Khamenei's full backing and from opportunities created by Western sanctions, which effectively excluded Iran from the global financial and trading system.\n\nThe Guards now control vast sectors of the economy, from oil to transportation, communications, and construction.\n\nAnother trader said the crisis was not over, as the Guards have long proved adept at defending their economic interests.\n\n\"The government wants to resolve the problem, but it lacks the means and power in this system. The economy is not controlled by the government,\" said the trader, a 62-year-old carpet seller in Tehran.\n\nAll aspects of the country's sanctions-hit oil business have come under the growing influence of the Guards - from the shadow fleet of tankers ⁠that secretly ship sanctioned crude, to logistics and front companies selling the oil, mostly to China.\n\n\"No one knows how ​much of the oil money that the Guards get from selling Iran’s oil returns to the country ... they are too ​powerful to be questioned about it,” said a senior Iranian official, who asked not to be named.\n\nDuring his 2013–2021 presidency, pragmatist Hassan Rouhani repeatedly clashed with the Guards, accusing them publicly of resisting budget cuts, while his attempts to curb their commercial networks and assets were largely frustrated.\n\nTHE ESTABLISHMENT RELIES ON THE GUARDS TO ‍END UNREST\n\nEven as it has relinquished economic power, the ⁠clerical establishment has relied on its loyal forces - the Guards and its affiliated Basij paramilitary - to violently crush ethnic uprisings, student unrest, and protests over economic hardship, preserving the political order.\n\n\"Given the sensitive circumstances when the country faces foreign threats, Khamenei cannot upset the Guards by curbing their economic influence. The establishment needs them to quell the protests and confront foreign threats,\" ⁠said an insider, close to Rouhani.\n\nU.S.-based rights group HRANA said it had verified the deaths of 544 people - 496 protesters and 48 security personnel - with 10,681 people arrested since the protests began on December 28 and spread around the country. Reuters ‌was unable to independently verify the tallies.\n\nThe authorities have not given numbers of casualties, but officials say many members of the security forces have been killed by \"terrorists and ‌rioters\" linked to foreign foes, including the U.S. States and Israel.\n\n(Writing by Parisa Hafezi;Editing by Frances Kerry)",

U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Good of domestic terrorism, saying she was attempting to ram the officer with her vehicle, while critics of the Trump administration have staged a series of protests to denounce the shooting as unjustified.Minnesota officials have pointed to bystander video they say showed Good's vehicle turning away from the agent as he fired.Noem and other U.S. officials have maintained that the agent acted in self-defense because Good, a volunteer in a community network that monitors and records ICE operations in Minneapolis, drove forward in the direction of the agent who then shot her, after another agent had approached the driver's side and told her to get out of the car.",

Chicago police confirmed Brown had been found but did not release any further details in the investigation.\n\nBrown was reported missing Saturday, Jan. 3, after she was last seen in the 4500 block of Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in the Bronzeville neighborhood.\n\nShe is a Chicago Public Schools special education teacher. Her husband, Antwon Brown, said she had an acupuncture appointment scheduled for Saturday morning that she never attended.\n\nHe said the night before her disappearance, the couple watched a movie before Brown went to bed. When he woke up the next morning, she was gone, he said.\n\nFamily members tried contacting Brown through phone calls and text messages, but after receiving no response, she was reported missing.\n\nRelatives said Brown has a history of mental illness but had never gone missing before.\n\nOn Thursday, the family released new details in their search. They said Brown’s blue Honda Civic was found near 35th Street and Lake Park Avenue.\n\nSurveillance video showed Brown parking her car, getting out and walking toward a pedestrian bridge leading to the lakefront, family members said. She appeared to be alone in the footage, recorded about 3 a.m. Jan. 3, the day she was reported missing. She was last seen walking across the bridge.\n\nA search party began looking for Brown along the lakefront Friday morning and has been ongoing since she was located on Monday.\n\nBrown’s family spoke out about her death Monday evening in a statement, shared below:\n\n\"It is with heavy hearts that we share an update regarding our beloved Linda Brown.\n\n\"Today, Linda’s body was found in the 31st Street Harbor along the Chicago lakefront. This is not the outcome we were hoping or praying for, but we are grateful that she has been found and can now be brought home to our family.\n\n\"We want to extend our deepest and most sincere gratitude to everyone who supported us during this unimaginable time. To the individuals, organizations, volunteers, advocates, and members of the community who helped search, shared Linda’s story, amplified her flyer, and stood beside our family — your love, compassion, and tireless efforts will never be forgotten. The outpouring of support meant more to us than words can express.\n\n\"At this time, we are respectfully asking for privacy as we grieve, process this loss, and come together as a family to honor Linda’s life.\n\n\"Thank you for continuing to hold our family in your thoughts and prayers. - Linda’s Family\"\n\nBrown's niece, Jen River, said her husband Antwon, is \"beside himself\" after learning she was found deceased.\n\n\"He is beside himself, he is very, very upset. This wasn't the outcome any of us hoped for… He really thought that we would bring Linda home safely and she would be alive and well. He is very deep in grief, having a hard time speaking and processing his thoughts,\" River said. \"He just lost the love of his life.\"\n\nAfter Brown's story drew nationwide attention, the family also took time to address some of the rumors and speculations they said could now be put to rest.\n\n\"Antwon has always been innocent. He's never been a suspect in this case… We've seen a lot of apologies to Antwon. It doesn't matter now but I'm glad people are seeing who Antwon truly is. I'm glad the facts have been released and we can now move on as a family,\" River said.\n\nPrincipal of Robert Healy Elementary School, where Brown was employed, issued a statement on her passing in a letter to the school community, shared below:\n\n\"Dear Healy Community,\n\n\"It is with deep sadness that I update you on a situation impacting our community. Ms. Linda Brown, one of our teachers, has passed away. Our thoughts are with her family during this difficult time. We know that this loss will raise many emotions, concerns, and questions for our entire school, especially our students.\n\n\"We are working closely with the Chicago Public Schools Crisis Management Unit to provide grief counseling and support to students and staff members. Our own school-based mental health professionals will also be available for students who need ongoing services.\n\n\"Information about the funeral service will be made available as soon as we have it. If your child wishes to attend, we strongly encourage you to accompany them to the service. If the funeral is scheduled during school hours, students who wish to attend will need parental permission to be released from school.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened by this loss and will do everything we can to help our school community heal.\n\n\"Sincerely, Principal Kamradt\"\n\nDetails on funeral arrangements haven't yet been announced. We'll bring more updates to this story as they become available.\n\nThe information in this article was provided by Chicago police, Linda's family and previous FOX 32 reporting.",

But those rebukes have picked up pace recently.\n\nOn Monday night’s edition of MS NOW’s The Rachel Maddow Show, the host ticked through the latest of them. She then gloated that Trump “is losing all the time and everywhere now”:\n\nYou might not have seen the headline today that today a federal court blocked the Trump administration from cutting energy funding just for blue states. This is billions of dollars Congress appropriated for clean energy projects of various kinds all over the country.\n\nTrump administration decided, and they admitted this — they decided that just in blue states, just in states that didn’t vote for Trump, they would cut all of that funding. They’d leave the funding in place in states that voted for Trump. They would cut it in states that didn’t vote for Trump.\n\nA federal court today ruled that that is illegal and stopped the Trump administration from doing that. That ruling today came after another federal court today stopped Trump from shutting down a big offshore wind farm in Rhode Island and Connecticut. Trump’s shutdown of that project, according to the courts today, was also illegal.\n\nAnd so, yet another federal court blocked Trump on that as well. So that work on the wind farm will be able to go ahead. Both of those rulings today follow.\n\nLast night, yet another federal court blocking Trump, this time from cutting funding to the American academy of pediatrics. This is a doctor’s group of pediatricians group that criticized the flock of ducks level insane quackery at Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services under RFK Jr.\n\nTrump responded by canceling federal grants for the American Academy of Pediatrics. A judge has now ruled that that was illegal retaliation. And so, Trump is blocked from doing that. That funding has to be reinstated.\n\nThat ruling comes after another federal judge just blocked Trump from cutting off federal election funds to states in retaliation for them not changing their election rules in ways that Trump wants. The judge said, quote, “the Constitution assigns no authority to the president over federal election administration.” And so, Trump got blocked on that one, too.\n\nShall I keep going? I could keep going. Another federal court just blocked Trump from freezing billions of dollars for childcare and social services for kids, again, in Democratic run states, as some kind of punishment against those states for electing Democrats, punishing them for that by cutting off the temporary assistance to needy families program.\n\nBecause, you know, you know, what would Jesus do? Trump was also just blocked from a — from doing that by yet another federal court.\n\nIt`s almost like he is losing all the time and everywhere now. There may still be people in America who are shocked that Trump keeps breaking the law over and over again, blatantly and insistently. The courts no longer appear to be shocked by that, and the courts now are just telling him no very bluntly, every single day, and often multiple times a day.\n\nAnd it’s not even just the courts, as I know you are aware, last week in one 48-hour stretch, we had a Senate vote for a War Powers resolution to block Trump from any further military adventurism. In Venezuela, five Republican senators crossed over to side with Democrats to pass that War Powers resolution. It was enough to advance that it’s going to get another vote in the Senate this week.\n\nThat came right on the heels of 17 Republicans in the House breaking ranks with Trump and siding with Democrats on the Affordable Care Act to try to, at least temporarily, undo the disastrous decision Trump and Republicans made in their so-called big beautiful bill. The decision to send tens of thousands of American families’ health insurance rates through the roof.\n\nSeventeen Republicans crossed over, defied Trump and joined with Democrats to pass that health care matter in the House.\n\nNow it`s going to come to the senate. Trump is now whining about how he might have to veto it if and when it passes in the senate as well, because he definitely wants to make sure that people’s health insurance premiums double or triple in cost for nothing other than something that he personally did. He apparently wants that.\n\nI mean, what we’ve just seen in Congress is one of the worst rebukes Trump has had from congressional Republicans since he has been back in office this whole disastrous year.\n\nWatch above via MS NOW’s The Rachel Maddow Show.\n\nThe post MS NOW’s Rachel Maddow Taunts Trump Over Blizzard of Defeats: ‘Losing All the Time and Everywhere!’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

Jurors were played footage of the crash and its aftermath showing fire and smoke billowing into the sky.\n\nMotin was charged days ‍later with causing the death of Filipino national and Solong crew member Mark Pernia, 38, whose body has never been found and is presumed dead.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to one count of gross negligence manslaughter and is on trial at ​London's Old Bailey court, where Little said Pernia's death was \"entirely avoidable\".\n\nCAPTAIN ACCUSED OF 'GROSSLY NEGLIGENT CONDUCT'\n\nLittle told jurors ‌as Motin listened with the help of a Russian interpreter: \"He (Pernia) would still be alive if it was not for the grossly negligent conduct of the man in the dock.\"\n\nHe said the Solong was on a collision course with the Stena Immaculate for over half an hour before the crash and was travelling at roughly 18 miles per hour (29 kph).\n\nLittle said Motin had sent WhatsApp messages to his wife after the crash, saying \"there had been ⁠a disaster and he will be 'guilty'\", to which his wife ​replied that he should say he did not see the other ​vessel on the ship's equipment.\n\nThe prosecutor told the court that Motin owed Pernia a duty of care as the Solong's captain and as he was \"on sole watch duty on the ‍bridge\" before the fatal crash.\n\n\"Ultimately, ⁠he did nothing, absolutely nothing, to avoid the collision,\" Little added.\n\nThe Solong's alarm system, which was intended to ensure someone was on the vessel's bridge, had been switched off and was not active on ⁠the morning of the crash, he said.\n\nLittle added that the crew of the Stena Immaculate and the Solong were given no ‌warning of the impending collision.\n\nThe trial is expected to conclude next month.",

    "description": "A young protester narrowly avoided being killed but was left permanently blind after a Department of Homeland Security agent fired a nonlethal round at close range during a Santa Ana protest last week, according to family of the victim.",
    "fullText": "A young protester narrowly avoided being killed but was left permanently blind after a Department of Homeland Security agent fired a nonlethal round at close range during a Santa Ana protest last week, according to family of the victim.\n\nJeri Rees said her 21-year-old nephew underwent six hours of surgery and that doctors found shards of plastic, glass and metal embedded in his eyes and around his face, including a metal piece lodged 7 millimeters from a carotid artery.\n\n\"That could have cost him his life,\" Rees said.\n\n\"But now, for the next six weeks, he can't sneeze or cough because it could do a lot of damage.\"\n\nShe said doctors did not want to remove the shrapnel near the artery out of fear that it could kill him. She said her nephew, who is transitioning and goes by the pronoun he, also suffered a fractured skull around his eyes and nose and that doctors said he had permanently lost the vision in his left eye. She said the Homeland Security agent was a few feet from her nephew when he fired the weapon.\n\nSeveral videos of Friday's incident were shared on social media. One video shows demonstrators, who were protesting the fatal shooting in Minnesota of Renee Good, throwing orange safety cones at the agents, who were standing guard outside the Santa Ana federal building.\n\nThe video cuts to three agents approaching the group before one agent tries to take a young person into custody, prompting at least three demonstrators to try to intervene. The person taken into custody was identified by friends as Skye Jones.\n\nIn the video, at least one agent appears to fire nonlethal rounds at the crowd, hitting one woman in the leg before aiming and striking a protester in the face.\n\nThe video shows that person dropping to the ground after being shot, holding their face as the crowd retreats. The same agent then drags the protester by the hood of their jacket; they appear to be choking, grasping at the jacket binding their neck as blood pours from their left eye.\n\nAnother video shows the protester inside the building, lying on the ground bleeding while agents fire what appear to be pepper balls at the back of the head and neck of a man trying to record the incident with his cellphone.\n\nRees said her nephew told her that the agents pressed his face against the pool of blood and did not immediately call paramedics.\n\n\"The other officers were mocking him, saying, 'You're going to lose your eye,'\" she said, recalling what her nephew told her.\n\nFriday's violent clash occurred just two days after a federal immigration agent fatally shot Good, a Minnesota mother of three. The slaying sparked public outcry, nationwide protests and scrutiny of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who said the agent was acting in self-defense.\n\nFriday's incident is the latest in a number of confrontations around the country in which agents have used deadly or what experts say is excessive force.\n\n\"This constitutes as deadly force as far as the law is concerned,\" said Ed Obayashi of the video. The Modoc County sheriff's deputy and legal advisor to police agencies, who has testified in similar cases, said that \"all the training manuals and [legal] cases say you don't aim at the face because these projectiles can cause serious injury [or] death.\"\n\nObayashi said, based on law enforcement use-of-force standards, an officer can deploy deadly force if they feel their life is in imminent danger, or that they are in danger of great bodily harm.\n\n\"I just don't see that here,\" he said.\n\nIn downtown Santa Ana, hundreds had gathered that Friday night to protest the killing of Good and the Trump administration's mass deportations. Some were there to speak out against police brutality as well. Protesters marched around the downtown area, chanting \"ICE out of O.C.\" and holding signs that read \"No more raids, keep families together.\"\n\nAn earlier protest started at 3 p.m. and was organized by the social justice organization Dare to Struggle, said member Connor Atwood. Some members reconvened just before 6:30 p.m. for a demonstration outside the federal building put together by another organization, he said.\n\nAtwood, who was present during the incident, said the scene turned chaotic as the protest began to wind down and the crowd dwindled. A group of protesters are seen in a video standing near a staircase away from the building’s entrance.\n\nHomeland Security agents stepped out of the building various times throughout the night, firing nonlethal rounds toward protesters, Atwood said.\n\nProtesters had not attempted to get closer or breach the entrance of the building, Atwood said.\n\nA portion of the crowd eventually dispersed, but leaders of Dare to Struggle encouraged some protesters to stand their ground to “say we're not going to be intimidated away from expressing what we feel right now and delivering our message,” Atwood said.\n\nSome protesters then began burning an American flag. At some point after 8:30 p.m., Jones, a leader of Dare to Struggle’s Orange County chapter, was arrested, Atwood said. The other protester was then hit in the eye.\n\n“It wasn't just completely out of nowhere, but it was very sudden,” Atwood said, adding that agents “had come out of the building several times before that, but they had not tried to arrest anyone or grab anyone.”\n\nIn an email response to The Times, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary with the Department of Homeland Security, said a \"mob of 60 rioters threw rocks, bottles and fireworks at law enforcement officers outside of the federal building.\"\n\n\"Two officers were injured. Two violent rioters were arrested and were charged with assault on federal officers and disorderly conduct,\" she wrote. \"This was a highly coordinated campaign of violence where rioters wielded shields.\"\n\nMcLaughlin did not respond to questions about protocols agents must follow when using less-lethal devices.\n\nA spokesperson for the Santa Ana Police Department said the only violence they were aware of that night were demonstrators tossing orange cones at the agents.\n\nAtwood said he didn’t witness bottles or rocks being thrown toward agents. Some firecrackers were set off near the sidewalk but away from the building entrance, he said.\n\nBoth Homeland Security agents and Santa Ana police were seen standing outside the federal building just after 10:30 p.m., according to video footage reviewed by The Times. Fire paramedics can be seen taking Rees' nephew in a gurney.\n\nAtwood said Jones had an initial hearing Monday. Rees said Jones had been released and was at the hospital with her nephew as of Monday night.\n\nAtwood said a news conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. Tuesday outside Santa Ana City Hall to provide more details about Friday's incident. The group is also raising money through GoFundMe to help with the protester's medical expenses.\n\nA.

Sources in touch with Bondi told the Journal that she was growing increasingly concerned about Trump’s complaints.\n\nThe Justice Department has brought charges against several Trump antagonists, but prosecutors have faced substantial setbacks.\n\nThe government is appealing November’s dismissals of its cases against New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey after a judge ruled that Trump had illegally appointed Lindsey Halligan, the attorney who obtained those indictments.\n\nSince that ruling, the Trump administration has tried and failed on two separate occasions to persuade a grand jury to indict James.\n\nMeanwhile, John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser, was indicted in October for allegedly mishandling classified documents. A trial date has yet to be determined.\n\nYet another investigation was revealed on Sunday. The Justice Department is now probing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell over comments he made to Congress about the bank’s building renovation.\n\nAccording to Trump, Bondi is also coming up short when it comes to the Epstein files, which have long cast a shadow over his presidency. That the government has produced less than 1 percent of its files, despite a law requiring their release last month, has only intensified scrutiny over the Trump-Epstein relationship and the president’s handling of it.\n\nThe Journal cites two officials who said that Trump agreed with Chief of Staff Susie Wiles’ assessment to Vanity Fair that Bondi “whiffed” on the issue.\n\nTrump’s obsession with the 2020 election has also led him to demand more from the Justice Department, according to the report.\n\nLast month, Trump resorted to issuing a symbolic pardon of Tina Peters, the former Colorado county elections clerk convicted of seven state charges, including tampering with voting machines. Peters remains in prison serving a nine-year sentence.\n\nTrump has occasionally confronted Bondi directly about his list of grievances, officials told the Journal.\n\nWhen reached for comment, the White House provided statements from Trump, Wiles, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt—all praising Bondi.\n\n“Pam is doing an excellent job,” said Trump.\n\n“She has been my friend for many years,” he added. “Tremendous progress is being made against radical left lunatics who are good at only one thing, cheating in elections and the crimes they commit.”\n\nThe Justice Department, in a brief statement, did not address the substance of the Journal’s report, telling the Daily Beast merely that Bondi “is focused on executing President Trump’s directive to Make America Safe Again.”",

    "fullText": "LONDON, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Global oil trading houses have emerged as early winners in the race to control Venezuelan crude flows, getting ahead of U.S. energy majors wary of credit and legal risks and securing a potentially lucrative business opportunity in the country with the world's largest crude reserves.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said U.S. majors would invest billions of dollars in Venezuela to quickly rebuild its dilapidated oil sector following the U.S. ​capture of President Nicolas Maduro earlier in January. Trump met top oil executives at the White House on Friday as his administration outlines a long-term plan to raise $100 billion to boost Venezuelan oil output.\n\nThe first companies to secure any business in the wake ‌of the U.S. military action in Caracas, however, were Dutch-based trader Vitol and Singapore-headquartered peer Trafigura, rather than U.S. majors.\n\nThe U.S. government tapped the giant merchant houses because they were better suited to quickly get Venezuelan oil exports flowing again, four industry sources familiar with the negotiations said. That is the first order of business for Washington before reconstruction ‌can begin, so that revenue from exports under U.S. supervision can fund the government of interim President Delcy Rodriguez in Caracas.\n\n\"Securing and marketing the initial barrels of Venezuelan crude oil was done at record speed to benefit both the American and Venezuelan people,\" a White House official told Reuters.\n\nVenezuela relies on oil exports for revenue, and has been starved of those proceeds for about a month under a blockade Trump imposed as he raised pressure on Maduro.\n\nWashington and Caracas are finalizing a $2 billion deal to sell up to 50 million barrels of crude to U.S. refiners and other buyers - oil that had been stuck on ships in Venezuelan waters and in storage tanks because of the blockade.\n\nFacilitating the initial oil sales was critical to ensure funds could flow back into Venezuela for everyday services and a process is in place to maintain the steady flow of production, sales, and refining of Venezuelan crude oil, the ⁠White House official said.\n\nTrafigura and Vitol have secured preliminary special licenses to negotiate and export the ‌Venezuelan crude, and Trafigura is set to load its first cargo this week, Chief Executive Richard Holtum said at the White House meeting with Trump.\n\nGLOBAL NETWORK ADDED TO TRADERS' APPEAL\n\nThe trading houses competed with Chevron to secure the supply deals. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major that operates in Venezuela, as a minority partner in joint ventures with Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA. Chevron has a license from U.S. authorities, which exempts it from ‍the sanctions the United States had imposed to choke off oil revenues to Maduro.",

    "fullText": "Big tech companies are increasingly striking direct deals with utilities to secure reliable, long-term energy supplies as their power needs surge, driven mainly by data centers, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. These agreements often include power purchase agreements for renewable energy, such as wind and solar, allowing tech firms to lock in stable prices while helping utilities finance new generation and grid upgrades. In some cases, companies are also partnering with utilities on energy storage, transmission expansion, and even next-generation sources like small modular nuclear reactors to ensure around-the-clock power. For utilities, these deals provide guaranteed demand and investment capital. At the same time, tech companies offer energy security, cost predictability, and progress toward sustainability goals—making the partnerships strategically crucial for both sides.\n\nGrowth and income investors looking for a safer way to play the AI and data center explosion have found an avenue with utility stocks.\n\nMany top U.S. utility companies have already cut landmark deals with big-tech giants.\n\nPaying dependable dividends and offering long-term safety for investors, top utility stocks make sense in a growth and income portfolio.\n\nA recent study identified one single habit that doubled Americans’ retirement savings and moved retirement from dream, to reality. Read more here.\n\nWe decided to screen our 24/7 Wall St. utility stocks research database to identify the top companies in the sector that have already struck substantial deals with some of Silicon Valley’s most prominent players. Surging demand for electricity, which will only continue to grow, has made some of America’s oldest and best utility companies one of the best investments for growth and income investors who would like to participate in the AI/data center revolution but would rather play it from a safer angle. What could be a better avenue than utility stocks that pay dependable, and in some cases large, dividend payments every quarter? Five top companies that we have covered for years may be perfect stocks for Boomer and Gen X investors, and all are rated Buy at the top Wall Street firms we cover.\n\nThis off-the-radar utility stock is an ideal choice for growth and income investors, with its hefty 3.93% dividend yield.

    "fullText": "With Mecum Kissimmee in full swing, it’s a good time to take a closer look at the factory options that turned performance machines into auction record holders.\n\nWhen these cars were new, they weren’t conceived as future collectibles. They were production vehicles that you could walk into a dealership and order by checking boxes on a form. Many of these options were skipped simply because the average buyer didn’t feel they needed the extra performance for the added cost, and no one was thinking about how those decisions would matter decades later.\n\nWhat follows isn’t an exhaustive list. It’s a cross-section of factory options and vehicles, shaped in part by what we could actually find source photos for. Some of the rarest configurations simply don’t have usable images available, so they aren’t represented here.\n\nDecades later, those same choices are why these cars now sit at the very top of the collector market.\n\nAmong American muscle cars, few factory option combinations have proven more valuable than the pairing of 426 Hemi power and a convertible body, particularly at the end of the muscle car era.\n\nFor 1971, the final year of Hemi ’Cuda production, Plymouth built just 12 Hemi ’Cuda Convertibles. That exceptionally low production figure is the primary driver of the model’s value today.\n\nSurvivorship is extremely limited, and documentation is critical. Cars retaining their original matching-numbers 426/425 HP Hemi engines, factory drivetrains, and verified build data occupy the top tier of the collector market. Differences such as automatic versus manual transmission, axle packages, and production sequence can have a measurable impact on value among the small number of known examples.\n\nA documented 1971 Hemi ’Cuda Convertible currently being offered at Mecum Kissimmee 2026 illustrates how a single factory option—combining the Hemi engine with a convertible body—now places these cars among the most valuable American muscle cars ever built.\n\nLike the other vehicles featured here, the Hemi ’Cuda Convertible’s status is not the result of racing success or aftermarket modification. Its value is defined by a factory-approved option that was technically available, rarely chosen, and never repeated.\n\nIn the late 1960s, General Motors officially limited Camaro engine displacement to 400 cubic inches. Dealers found a workaround through the Central Office Production Order (COPO) system, which allowed special-purpose vehicles to bypass standard restrictions.\n\nThrough COPO, select Camaros could be ordered with 427-cubic-inch V8s. Most received iron-block engines, but just 69 were fitted with the all-aluminum ZL1, an engine derived from Chevrolet’s Can-Am racing program. The ZL1 dramatically reduced weight while delivering immense power, making it one of the most extreme factory engine options ever installed in a street car.\n\nThat simple engine choice is what elevates documented COPO ZL1 Camaros into seven-figure territory today.\n\nThe Judge was already a bold performance and appearance package, but pairing it with a convertible body style created one of the rarest factory GTO configurations Pontiac ever offered.\n\nOnly 168 GTO Judge Convertibles were built for the 1970 model year. While no exotic engine separates these cars mechanically, the Judge package itself was a defining factory option, and combining it with an open body proved unpopular when new.\n\nThat low take rate is what drives their value today.\n\nDodge produced 963 Challenger R/T Convertibles in 1970. Of those, just five were ordered with the 426 Street Hemi and a four-speed manual transmission.\n\nThe Hemi was a fully factory-approved engine option, but its high cost and demanding nature discouraged most buyers, particularly in a convertible. Survivorship is exceptionally low, and the rarity of that option combination is what pushes these cars into million-dollar territory.\n\nBuilt to homologate aerodynamic components for NASCAR competition, the Superbird was extreme even by muscle-car standards. Approximately 1,920 were produced, most equipped with the 440 Magnum V8.\n\nOnly roughly 135–170 were ordered with the optional 426 Hemi, a costly upgrade few buyers selected at the time. Today, that single factory engine option often separates six-figure Superbirds from seven-figure examples.\n\nDodge built 503 Charger Daytonas, the majority powered by the 440 Magnum. Only about 70 left the factory with the 426 Hemi, making them among the rarest American muscle cars ever produced.\n\nThe combination of radical aerodynamics and the Hemi engine created a dominant race car and one of the most valuable factory option packages of the era.\n\nAuction Prices: Multiple sales in the multi-million-dollar range\n\nWhen the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL debuted in 1954, it was already revolutionary. A small number of buyers, however, were allowed to order the Leichtmetallausführung, or Light Metal Version.\n\nThis factory option replaced the standard steel body panels with aluminum and added competition-oriented components. The option carried a substantial price premium when new, and fewer than 30 alloy-bodied Gullwings were produced.\n\nToday, documented factory alloy examples sell for millions more than standard steel-bodied cars.\n\nAuction Prices: Can exceed $3 million\n\nThe L88 was one of the most extreme factory engine options ever offered in a production Corvette. Introduced in 1967 and available through 1969, the option spanned the final year of the C2 and the early C3 generation, with the engine itself—rather than the body style—being the defining factor.\n\nOfficially rated at 430 horsepower, the aluminum-head 427-cubic-inch V-8 was intentionally underrated. Real-world output was significantly higher, but Chevrolet paired the L88 with restrictive ordering requirements that ensured only informed buyers selected it.\n\nChoosing RPO L88 automatically bundled heavy-duty suspension and cooling components while deleting common comfort features such as a radio and heater. The result was a Corvette that prioritized performance over usability, reinforcing the engine’s competition-focused intent.\n\nOriginality and documentation are critical to value, as the L88’s purpose-built nature makes correct components and factory verification especially important. Well-documented examples, whether late-C2 or early-C3, consistently reside at the top of the Corvette market.\n\nLike the other vehicles featured here, the L88 Corvette’s status is defined by a factory-approved option that was technically available, rarely chosen, and never intended for casual ownership. That single engine decision is what now places these cars firmly in multi-million-dollar territory.\n\nThe L89 was a factory option that spanned two Corvette generations, appearing in the final year of the C2 and the first year of the C3. Rather than being tied to a single body style, the option itself was the defining factor.\n\nRPO L89 paired Chevrolet’s 427-cubic-inch big-block with aluminum cylinder heads, reducing weight while preserving street usability. It could be ordered with several 427 variants, making it a flexible but rarely selected performance upgrade.\n\nIn total, fewer than 850 Corvettes are believed to have been equipped with the L89 option across both model years. While not every example commands seven figures, the most original, well-documented cars—regardless of generation—have crossed the million-dollar mark at auction.\n\nAs with the other vehicles featured here, it is the factory-approved option, not the body style alone, that defines long-term value.\n\nAuction Prices: Approaching or exceeding $1 million\n\nOffered for just one year, RPO ZR2 was a factory competition package built around the high-revving LT1 small-block V8. It bundled heavy-duty suspension, upgraded cooling, racing-focused driveline components, and deleted common comfort features.\n\nOnly 12 ZR2 Corvettes were built, making it one of the rarest factory Corvette options ever offered.\n\nNone of these cars became million-dollar collectibles by accident. In every case, the leap in value traces back to factory-approved options that were available, yet rarely chosen.\n\nThese were not dealer modifications or one-off prototypes. They were decisions made on order forms, often dismissed as unnecessary at the time. Decades later, those same decisions define the top of the collector market.\n\nSometimes, the most valuable performance upgrade isn’t horsepower alone—it’s the option almost no one ordered.",

    "fullText": "As the Trump administration intensifies immigration enforcement nationwide, a wave of high-profile arrests — many unfolding at private homes and businesses and captured on video — has pushed one legal question into the center of the national debate: When can federal immigration agents lawfully enter private property to make an arrest?\n\nThat question has taken on new urgency in cities like Minneapolis, where thousands of federal agents are operating on the streets amid protests, confrontations and a fatal shooting, sharpening scrutiny of the legal authority immigration officers rely on when they arrive at the front door.\n\nAt the heart of the debate is a legal distinction largely unfamiliar to the public but central to immigration enforcement.\n\nMost immigration arrests are carried out under administrative warrants, internal documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize the arrest of a specific individual but do not permit officers to forcibly enter private homes or other non-public spaces without consent. Only criminal warrants signed by judges carry that authority. Legal experts say the administration’s aggressive enforcement push, combined with public awareness of those limits, is increasingly turning door-knock encounters into flashpoints, fueling confrontations that are now playing out in cities across the country.\n\nHere is what to know about the limitations on the warrants that authorize most immigration related arrests.\n\nImmigration warrants typically don't authorize entry onto private property\n\nAll law enforcement operations — including those conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection — are governed by the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects all people in the country from unreasonable searches and seizures. That means law enforcement is required to have a warrant before searching one's private property or arresting someone, regardless of immigration status.\n\nBut not all warrants are the same. Typically, arrests carried out by Department of Homeland Security agencies are authorized by administrative warrants — sometimes known as immigration warrants — not judicial warrants.\n\nJudicial warrants are issued by a court and signed by a magistrate or a state or federal judge. These warrants allow a relevant law enforcement agency to apprehend a specified individual in any context — regardless of whether the person is on public or on private property. In other words, law enforcement is legally allowed to enter and search a home or business to make the arrest without the consent of the property owner once a judge signs off on the arrest.\n\nThat means people can legally refuse federal immigration agents entry into private property if the agents only have an administrative warrant.\n\nThere are limited exceptions, some of which include if someone is in immediate danger, an officer is actively chasing a suspect or if someone is calling for help inside the residence. But those exceptions don't apply in routine immigration arrests, legal experts say.\n\nJohn Sandweg, a former ICE acting director, said officers are trained on what circumstances legally justify forced entry. But as the scope of ICE's work has expanded, and more Border Patrol agents have begun conducting the work of ICE officers, there is a greater chance that agents will misapply the rules, he said.\n\n“Your risks of all of these types of incidents increase dramatically when you take officers out of their normal operating environment and ask them to do things that they have not been trained to do, because it’s not part of their core missions,” Sandweg said.\n\nMounting tensions in Minneapolis\n\nThe thorny legal distinction between judicial and administrative warrants came to the fore on Sunday when immigration law enforcement raided a private home to make an arrest in Minneapolis, after clashing with protesters who confronted the heavily armed agents. Documents reviewed by The Associated Press revealed that the agents only had an administrative warrant — meaning there was no judge that authorized the raid on private property.\n\nWhen asked, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin didn't provide a legal justification for the forced entry and arrest of the man, who is a Liberian national with a deportation order from 2023. She said his arrest was part of the administration's efforts to arrest “the worst of the worst” and added that he had that a criminal history including “robbery, drug possession with the intent to sell, possession of a deadly weapon, malicious destruction and theft.\"\n\nMcLaughlin didn't specify whether he was convicted of any of those crimes, or whether his arrest was related to any criminal activity.\n\nVice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center, Heidi Altman, said she couldn’t comment on that specific raid, but said that generally an officer entering a home without consent or permission could result in serious consequences.\n\n“That is not just an illegal arrest. It’s numerous illegal actions by the officer themselves that could open up liability, not just for being sued, but potential criminal actions under state law as well,” she explained.\n\nBut in the current political climate, Altman said, it isn’t clear if there are any realistic avenues for accountability since the federal government would be responsible for investigating such a breech.\n\n“There are layers of federal laws and regulations and policies prohibiting this kind of behavior. But then the second layer is: Is the federal government going to impose consequences?\" she said.\n\nOn top of that, immigrants have less recourse after an illegal arrest or search, since the illegally obtained evidence can still be used in immigration court. It’s called the exclusionary rule, Altman explained, and the consequences that the officer may face would not undo the immediate consequences immigrants could face if they are quickly deported.\n\n“As those legal challenges come and people are facing very, very quick detentions and deportations on the basis of these illegal arrests, there’s very little recourse in actual immigration court proceedings that allows people to have a judge disregard evidence or the actual arrest, even if it was done in this very violent, illegal manner,” Altman said.\n\nICE has long relied on “knock and talks\" to make apprehensions, informally requesting residents to leave a home without giving any indication they plan to make an immigration arrest. As outlined in a 2020 lawsuit in which a federal judge found the practice illegal, officers tell their targets that they need them to step outside to answer a few questions. In one case, they told a woman that they were probation officers looking for her brother.\n\nIn response, activists, lawyers and local governments have launched “know-your-rights” campaigns around the country, attempting to educate people on the legal nuances of the extremely convoluted legal framework that is supposed to govern immigration law enforcement.\n\nMany groups have published fact sheets and infographics on social media, while others facilitate meetings that go over constitutional protections that immigrants have — regardless of legal status — in interactions with federal agents.\n\nOften groups will instruct immigrants to request to see a warrant before opening the door if an immigration officer knocks. The trainings also typically emphasize that an immigrant can refuse to open the door if law enforcement only has an administrative warrant.",

    "description": "KeyBanc analyst John Vinh upgraded Intel to Overweight from Sector Weight.",
    "fullText": "Intel (INTC) stock climbed more than 5% Tuesday as investment firm KeyBanc upgraded shares to Overweight from Sector Weight, citing the chipmaker’s advances in its manufacturing business and demand for its chips from AI data centers.\n\nAnalyst John Vinh said in a note to clients Tuesday that Big Tech’s demand for chips and servers to power AI is leading to higher sales of Intel’s CPUs — central processing units, or more traditional computer chips used alongside AI chips such as Nvidia's (NVDA) GPUs to train and run artificial intelligence models. Vinh said his supply chain checks show Intel is “almost sold out for the year” in data center server CPUs and may raise prices on the chips.\n\nVinh also cited “significant progress\" in Intel's manufacturing business.\n\nIntel has worked to revive its manufacturing arm, Intel Foundry Services (IFS), just as its chips have lost ground to AMD (AMD) and Arm (ARM). The company has fallen into a vicious cycle: Manufacturing stumbles hurt the competitiveness of its chips, and softer chip sales left its factories underutilized, which only made the manufacturing turnaround harder. Early reported tests of Intel's latest manufacturing process, 18A, by Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO) failed to result in major deals for Intel.\n\nBut a new CEO, investments from the US government and Nvidia, and the so-far successful launch of PC chips made with 18A have buoyed investor confidence in Intel’s ability to right the ship.\n\nIn what would be a major boost for IFS, Vinh said his supply chain checks in Asia indicate that Intel has signed Apple (AAPL) as a customer to use its next-generation manufacturing 18A-P process to make low-end PC chips for its Macs and iPads. In semiconductor terms, Intel's recently launched 18A process node represents the latest generation of its chip fabrication technology, and 18A-P is an advanced, upcoming version of that node.\n\nThe potential Apple deal was first predicted by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in late November, sending Intel shares soaring. Vinh called the rumored partnership Intel’s “first big whale design win.”\n\nThe KeyBanc analyst also said he believes the two tech firms are in discussions for Apple to use Intel’s upcoming process, 14A, to make low-end chips for iPhones in 2029.\n\nIntel and Apple did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment on the possible deals.\n\nMeanwhile, Vinh said 18A’s improving yield — the percentage of chips that a manufacturer produces from a silicon wafer that function correctly — is “enough to convince us it could credibly be the #2 foundry supplier in the industry ahead of Samsung.” The chip manufacturing industry has just three large-scale players: the leading, Taiwan-based TSMC (TSM), Korea’s Samsung (005930.KS), and US-based Intel.",

    "description": "Julian Sands was reported missing on Jan. 13, 2023, but his death wasn't confirmed until five months later",
    "fullText": "Actor Julian Sands was reported missing three years ago on Jan. 13, 2023, after going on a hike in California\n\nHis remains were found on June 24, 2023, with his death confirmed three days later\n\nSands, who was mourned by his family and fans, was 65 years old at the time of his death\n\nActor Julian Sands disappeared during a hike on Mount Baldy in southern California three years ago on Jan. 13, 2023. The search for the star ended in tragedy when he was confirmed to be dead five months later on June 27, 2023.\n\nThe British actor was best known for roles in films like A Room with a View, Warlock and Arachnophobia. He had three children: a son, Henry, whom he shared with ex-wife Sarah Sands, and daughters Natalya and Imogen, whom he shared with wife Evgenia Citkowitz.\n\nOn Jan. 13, 2023, the Smallville star was reported missing by Citkowitz after he had set out to hike California's Mount Baldy. The spot was Sands' \"favorite place\" when he was in Los Angeles, as his brother Nick later told the Craven Herald & Pioneer.\n\nSearches continued for more than five months before Sands' remains were found on June 24, 2023, by a group of hikers.\n\nSo, what exactly happened to the actor? Here's everything to know about Julian Sands' death, including what his family has said about the hiking accident.\n\nThe exact date that Sands died is unknown due to the length of time it took to find his body. He died between the dates of Jan. 13, 2023, when he was reported missing, and June 24, 2023, when his remains were found. Authorities confirmed his death on June 27.\n\nThe San Bernardino County sheriff’s department warned of a dangerous situation for Mount Baldy hikers on their Facebook page just days after Sands’ disappearance on Jan. 18.\n\n“Due to the high winds, the snow has turned to ice making hiking extremely dangerous,” the post read. \"Teams have responded to 14 rescue missions on Mt Baldy and in the surrounding area. These rescue missions have been for lost, stranded and/or injured hikers.\"\n\nThe department also noted that their rescue efforts had been affected, stating, “Sheriff’s Search and Rescue efforts are often hampered by poor weather along with dangerous avalanche conditions.“\n\nThe actor’s official cause of death was ruled as “undetermined\" by the coroner, an information officer for the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department in San Bernardino, Calif., confirmed to PEOPLE on July 24, 2023.\n\nAccording to the officer, the decision to classify Sands’ death as such was the result of the deteriorated condition of his body.\n\n“This is common when dealing with cases of this type,” the officer said.\n\nWhile the location of Sands’ body in Goode Canyon could suggest a fall, the Los Angeles Times reported that he may have been a victim of an avalanche, been injured or gotten lost.\n\nBill Dwyer and a group of other unnamed hikers found Sands in a flat area of Mount Baldy known as Goode Canyon.\n\nThey spotted him after first noticing his boots, trekking poles, a pile of clothing and a wallet containing his driver's license.\n\n“It was surreal,” Dwyer later told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, members of Sands’ search and rescue team had previously searched the area after receiving a ping from the actor’s cell phone from a nearby ridge on the Baldy Bowl trail.\n\n“If they had gone another 600 feet farther down, they might have found him,” search team member Donna Newlins told the publication.\n\nAfter Sands was reported missing, eight separate searches were conducted by authorities, both from the sky and on the ground, with 500 hours of man time logged and $100,000 spent on resources, per the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIn part, search parties were unable to locate Sands’ remains due to dangerous weather conditions.\n\nA final search was conducted on June 17, 2023, which included more than 80 search and rescue volunteers and staff members. They were supported by two helicopters and drone crews, according to a statement from San Bernardino sheriff’s department.\n\nSands’ family issued a statement via the San Bernardino County sheriff’s X account on June 21, 2023, writing, “We are deeply grateful to the search teams and coordinators who have worked tirelessly to find Julian.”\n\nThe actor’s remains were found by a group of hikers three days later.\n\nSands’ funeral details were kept private by the family, but several people close to the actor publicly spoke out about his death.\n\nHis ex-wife Sarah told the Daily Mail in August 2023 that he was a \"restless\" and \"curious\" person.\n\n\"Both artistically and geographically an adventurer,\" she said. \"I couldn't imagine him being imprisoned in any way; through illness or old age.\"\n\nSands’ manager Sarah Jackson said in a statement to PEOPLE that “Julian was a great friend and client ... He was a passionate climber, and we draw consolation from knowing that he passed in a place he loved, doing what he loved.”",

    "fullText": "The world’s first tuned Chevrolet C8 Corvette ZR1 has officially hit the dyno, and the results are already eye-opening. In a development video published by Burger Motorsports, the company behind the JB4PRO and JB4 tuning modules, the twin-turbo Corvette delivered over 1,000 wheel horsepower in completely stock form on 93-octane pump gas. Baseline runs showed approximately 1,010 wheel horsepower and 815 lb-ft of torque, confirming just how aggressive the factory calibration is on Chevrolet’s most powerful production Corvette to date.\n\nThe testing also highlighted how carefully the ZR1 has been engineered by General Motors. Peak boost reached roughly 20 psi at low rpm before tapering to about 17 psi up top, with stable air-fuel ratios and turbo shaft speeds hovering around 120,000 rpm.\n\nEven before tuning, the data suggested there was limited, but usable, headroom for additional power if approached with detailed sensor monitoring and conservative boost control. Suddenly, the Ford Mustang GTD because even more insecure.\n\nBurger Motorsports used its JB4PRO system for development, selected for its ability to intercept and analyze up to 40 sensor inputs, including digital MAF signals, turbo shaft speed, and both high- and low-pressure fuel data. Installation proved challenging due to the Corvette’s mid-engine layout, but once wired, the system provided the level of data access needed to safely adjust boost and fueling on the seemingly underestimated LT7 twin-turbo engine.\n\nWith JB4PRO Map 1 on 93-octane pump gas, output increased to 1,048 wheel horsepower and 896 lb-ft of torque, nearly a 50-horsepower gain with no hardware changes. Switching to an E30 blend and Map 2 pushed output past 1,060 wheel horsepower and 943 lb-ft, while mid-range gains exceeded 150 wheel horsepower. Burger Motorsports emphasized that these gains came from controlled adjustments, not aggressive peak-boost spikes.\n\nView the 3 images of this gallery on the original article\n\nThe highest numbers came with JB4PRO Map 3 running on 100-octane race fuel. Under those conditions, the C8 ZR1 produced approximately 1,170 wheel horsepower and 980 lb-ft of torque. While peak output increased by about 100 wheel horsepower over stock, the most significant improvement occurred in the mid-range, where the tuned setup showed more than 220 additional wheel horsepower at 6,000 rpm.\n\nAccording to Burger Motorsports, multiple JB4PRO maps will be offered to support different fuel types, ranging from conservative 91-octane setups to race-gas configurations. Early testing confirms that the C8 ZR1 is not only historically powerful out of the box, but also capable of safely delivering supercar-level gains with minimal tuning, setting the stage for far more extreme builds to follow.\n\nView the 3 images of this gallery on the original article",

    "fullText": "A waitress who carried the sparklers that allegedly started the fatal Swiss bar fire was among those who died in the blaze, it has emerged.\n\nCyane Panine was one of 40 people who died in the New Year’s Eve tragedy. She has been identified as the woman seen in images wearing a crash helmet and carrying sparklers moments before the accidental blaze erupted, 20 Minuten reported.\n\nFootage from the night showed a young woman sitting on one of her colleague’s shoulders, brandishing two champagne bottles with sparklers attached. The ceiling then caught fire.\n\nThe owners of Le Constellation in Crans-Montana revealed last week how they viewed Ms Panine as a “stepdaughter” and said she suffocated “in a pile of bodies behind a locked door”.\n\nThe owners, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, were able to identify the 24-year-old during photos taken during the blaze, according to local media.\n\nThey said Ms Panine’s last moments alive reflected the nature of the tragedy.\n\nMs Moretti had asked her employee to “get the atmosphere going” at the bar, located in an Alpine ski resort, in the early hours of Jan 1, according to her interview with Swiss investigators.\n\nWaitresses put sparklers in champagne bottles, with some lifted up onto the shoulders of waiters, who then paraded their colleagues around the room.\n\nThe pyrotechnics lit the soundproofing foam in the ceiling, sparking the blaze which killed dozens and injured 116 others.\n\nMr Moretti, 49, said he broke open the door to the basement from the outside, where he found Ms Panine dying, surrounded by a “pile of bodies”.\n\nOn Friday, he told the Valais public prosecutor’s office he only realised that the bar’s “service door” was “locked from the inside and on a latch” after the blaze.\n\nMr Moretti is in custody, while his wife was bailed with an electronic tag. They are awaiting a possible trial on a number of charges including manslaughter and causing bodily harm by negligence.\n\nHe said that Ms Panine was the girlfriend of a close family friend, who he and his wife “raised as if he were my own”.\n\nMr Moretti added: “I went out onto the patio [behind the bar] All the windows were open.\n\n“There were a lot of people there. I tried to get inside but it was impossible. There was far too much smoke.”\n\nSpeaking about how the bar’s “service door” was shut, he said: “We forced it open – it finally gave way in a few seconds. When the door opened, several people were lying on the floor, unconscious.\n\n“My stepdaughter Cyane was one of them. We pulled them all outside and put them in the recovery position.”\n\nMr Moretti said he and Ms Panine’s boyfriend “tried to resuscitate her for more than an hour in the street near the bar, until the emergency services told us it was too late”.\n\nSpeaking to The Telegraph, a lawyer for Ms Panine’s family, Sophie Haenni, declined to confirm that she was the staff member in the crash helmet.\n\n“Based on the current state of the case, I cannot confirm that. The investigation will prove it,” she said.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "The Court must deal with the chaos it created around guns.",
    "fullText": "Judges rarely complain openly about the Supreme Court, for the same reason that most people do not publicly chastise their bosses. Attacking your boss is a good way to ensure that your own work will be discounted — or worse.\n\nSo it’s remarkable just how many judges have published opinions criticizing the Supreme Court’s decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n v. Bruen (2022), a decision by all six of the Court’s Republicans that instructs lower court judges on how they should handle Second Amendment cases.\n\nOr, at least, Bruen purports to provide lower courts with this kind of guidance. As one federal judge complained in a 2023 opinion, the “unique test” the Republican justices came up with in Bruen “does not provide lower courts with clear guidance.” Courts, a different federal appellate judge wrote, “are struggling at every stage of the Bruen inquiry.”\n\nIndeed, in her concurring opinion in United States v. Rahimi (2024), the Supreme Court’s only attempt to interpret Bruen since that decision was handed down, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson quoted a dozen different judicial opinions complaining that Bruen simply does not work. One Trump appointee protested Bruen’s “inconsistent and amorphous standard” and warned that it “created mountains of work for district courts that must now deal with Bruen-related arguments in nearly every criminal case in which a firearm is found”\n\nBriefly, Bruen held that for nearly any gun law to survive a constitutional challenge, “the government must demonstrate that the regulation is consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.” To meet this burden, government lawyers must show that the modern-day gun law they are defending is sufficiently similar to “analogous regulations” that existed when the Constitution was framed.\n\nAnd just how “analogous” must these long-forgotten laws be? As the dozen judges quoted by Justice Jackson show, no one really knows. In 2020, the federal government alone charged more than 14,000 defendants with firearm-related crimes. Thanks to Bruen, every single one of those cases can descend into a Mad Hatter–like inquiry into how a raven resembles a writing desk.\n\nWhich brings us to Wolford v. Lopez, the first of two Second Amendment cases that the Court plans to hear in its current term. Wolford, which the justices will hear on January 20, is poised to be the Court’s second-ever decision explaining what the hell Bruen means.\n\nA humbler Court would recognize that Bruen is a failure and overrule that decision — prior to Bruen, every federal appeals court used a two-step framework (which I explain in more detail here) to analyze Second Amendment cases. The Court could simply restore this framework, which worked perfectly well and did not create the same confusion among judges.\n\nBut that outcome is unlikely. Historical analysis is currently fashionable among Republican judges, many of whom identify with originalism — an approach to constitutional cases which fixates on how words were understood more than 200 years ago. In Bruen, the Republican justices attempted to build a framework for interpreting an entire constitutional amendment that is grounded in originalism. Overruling Bruen means admitting that this originalist project failed.\n\nStill, the Wolford case should give pro-gun Republicans pause for an unexpected reason: The biggest advantage the lawyers defending a Hawaii gun law have on their side is the Court’s cockamamie reasoning in Bruen.\n\nThe plaintiffs in Wolford, three gun owners and a pro-gun advocacy group, challenge a fairly clever Hawaii law that appears to be designed to undermine the result the Court reached in Bruen.\n\nBruen struck down a 108-year-old New York state law that required anyone who wanted to carry a handgun in public to demonstrate “proper cause” before they could obtain a license allowing them to do so. The Hawaii law at issue in Wolford imposes similarly strict restrictions on public carry through a different means. It makes it a crime to bring a gun onto private property “unless the person has been given express authorization to carry a firearm on the property by the owner, lessee, operator, or manager of the property.”\n\nThus, the practical effect of Hawaii’s law is to remove guns from most shops, hotels, restaurants, and other places of business. Most business owners aren’t going to put out a sign announcing that guns are allowed inside. And few gun owners are likely to enter such a business without their firearm, track down the manager, obtain permission to bring their gun inside, and then go retrieve the weapon.\n\nIf Bruen were a coherent decision that applied normal legal reasoning, in other words, the Wolford plaintiffs would have a fairly clear cut case. Typically, the Supreme Court does not allow states to bypass its decisions by concocting Rube Goldberg–like devices to achieve ends that the Court has already determined are unconstitutional.\n\nAnd yet, somewhat ironically, the best thing that Hawaii’s lawyers have going for them in Wolford is the nonsensical historical framework laid out in Bruen.\n\nIn their brief to the justices, Hawaii’s lawyers identify various colonial and early American state laws that closely resemble the Hawaii statute forbidding gun owners to bring their weapons onto private land without the landowner’s permission.\n\nThis list includes a 1771 New Jersey law barring someone from bringing “any gun on any Lands not his own, and for which the owner pays taxes, or is in his lawful possession, unless he has license or permission in writing from the owner.” It also includes a similar 1721 Pennsylvania law preventing someone from hunting or bringing a gun onto another person’s land without “Lisence [sic] or Permission from the Owner of any such Lands or Plantation,” and a 1763 New York law making it unlawful to carry a gun on “inclosed Land” without “License in Writing first had and obtained for that Purpose from such Owner, Proprietor, or Possessor.”\n\nIt appears, in other words, that Americans around the time of the nation’s founding and the ratification of the Second Amendment were quite comfortable with laws banning gun possession on private land without the land owner’s permission. That should be enough to uphold Hawaii’s law under Bruen’s “historical tradition of firearm regulation” standard. But it’s not that simple.\n\nWolford should be an awkward case for the Court’s Republicans, because the largely pro-gun framework they announced in Bruen doesn’t actually point to a pro-gun result in this case. Realistically, however, the Bruen framework is sufficiently malleable that these justices can reach whatever result they want in Wolford.\n\nConsider, for example, Rahimi, the only post-Bruen case the Court has handed down interpreting that decision.\n\nRahimi involved a cartoonishly violent individual who, when the Court decided this case, was accused of committing six different shooting crimes — that is, crimes where he actually discharged a firearm. In one of these incidents, he allegedly fired his gun at a bystander who witnessed him beating the mother of his child. A majority of the justices voted to uphold his conviction under a federal law that prohibits many people who are subject to domestic violence restraining orders from possessing a gun.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the majority opinion in Rahimi, primarily reasoned that this federal law was sufficiently similar to Founding Era laws that required individuals who were believed to be likely to engage in violence to post a bond, which they would forfeit if they “broke the peace.”\n\nIn dissent, meanwhile, Justice Clarence Thomas argued that these bond-posting laws were not sufficiently similar to the modern-day ban on carrying a gun while under a restraining order, because the Founding Era laws “imposed a far less onerous burden.” They neither disarmed individuals nor incarcerated them if they were later found with a gun.\n\nBecause Bruen’s “analogous regulations” test is so vague, both Roberts and Thomas made plausible arguments: Bruen didn’t fully explain just how similar a modern law must be to a colonial or early American law in order to survive judicial review. Indeed, if anything, Thomas had the stronger argument that the law in Rahimi should have been struck down under Bruen.\n\nBruen said that “when a challenged regulation addresses a general societal problem that has persisted since the 18th century, the lack of a distinctly similar historical regulation addressing that problem is relevant evidence that the challenged regulation is inconsistent with the Second Amendment.” Violence between romantic partners is a societal problem that existed well before the 18th century. But every state permitted married partners to beat their spouses until 1871, when the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that a husband and wife “may be indicted for assault and battery upon each other.”\n\nBruen, in other words, does not actually tell judges how to decide gun cases — as so many lower court judges have complained. It merely insists that they must tell a story about whether a modern law is similar to a very old law.\n\nIndeed, there is empirical evidence that Bruen gives judges broad leeway to decide gun cases however they choose. A 2023 paper by scholars Eric Ruben, Rosanna Smart, and Ali Rowhani-Rahbar indicates that “Bruen has not meaningfully constrained judges” and has instead freed them to decide gun cases according to their “judicial ideology.” The paper finds that “judges appointed by Republican presidents are 1.8 times as likely” to rule that a gun law violates Bruen “as judges appointed by Democratic presidents.”\n\nBruen, in other words, is not law. Rather than constraining how judges decide cases, it merely requires them to cite historical sources in an opinion that reaches whatever conclusion aligns with their politics. On a 6-3 Republican Supreme Court, that means that the Hawaii law at issue in Wolford is likely to fall.",

    "title": "As 2026 World Cup nears, Alan Rothenberg reflects on U.S. soccer's transformation",
    "description": "As the man behind the 1984 L.A. Olympics soccer tournament and the 1994 World Cup, Alan Rothenberg arguably had more to do with writing the story of modern U.S. Soccer than anyone.",
    "fullText": "Alan Rothenberg has a story he wants to tell you. A lot of stories actually; enough to fill a book.\n\nBut that’s not the first memorable work he’s authored. As the man behind the 1984 L.A. Olympics soccer tournament and the 1994 World Cup, still the most successful in history, Rothenberg has arguably had more to do with writing the story of U.S. Soccer in the modern era than anyone.\n\nAnd you can draw a straight line from that chapter to the one that will be written this summer when the World Cup returns to the U.S.\n\n“The turning point really was the Olympics,” he said last month over brunch in a crowded Sherman Oaks diner. “That soccer was so successful in the Olympics, that’s when FIFA thought maybe we could bring our crown jewel to the United States and not be embarrassed.\n\n“So ‘84 Olympics. That’s a crucial part of the story. I doubt that we would be where we are now but for that.”\n\nThat story’s in “The Big Bounce: The Surge That Shaped the Future of U.S. Soccer,” which is available Feb. 10. In fact, the book starts there.\n\nBut Rothenberg’s career did not. Before changing the face of U.S. Soccer, he first altered the landscape of sports in his adopted hometown, playing instrumental roles in bringing the Clippers to Los Angeles, in negotiating the trade that made Kareem Abdul-Jabbar a Laker and in settling the Kings at the Forum.\n\nAs a lawyer who started his career as the in-house counsel for Jack Kent Cooke when Cooke owned the Lakers, the Kings, the then-Washington Redskins and was launching the Wolves of the nascent NASL, Rothenberg was involved in some of the most consequential events in four sports during a career that’s nearing the end of its sixth decade. Yet he knew little about soccer when Peter Ueberroth, chair of the L.A. Olympic Organizing Committee, put him in charge of the sport for the 1984 Games.\n\n“Peter assumed with that background I must know a lot about soccer,” Rothenberg writes. “That was wrong.”\n\nWhat he lacked in soccer knowledge he more than made up for in creativity and organization skills, however, and the Olympic tournament proved to be one of the most successful in history, with the final at the Rose Bowl drawing a crowd of 104,098, a U.S. record for a soccer game that stood for 30 years.\n\nBut his name will forever be synonymous with the World Cup.\n\nThe 1994 tournament was the first to be played in a country without a first-division league and there were widespread fears it would be a disaster. Instead, it drew an average of 69,174 fans to each of the 52 games, an attendance record that still stands. It also generated a surplus of more than $50 million — also a record — money that went to the U.S. Soccer Foundation to promote the growth of the sport in the U.S.\n\nTwo years later, Major League Soccer kicked off; 30 years later it’s the sixth-most-valuable soccer league in the world.\n\n“Everything flowed from ‘94,” Rothenberg said. “If ‘94 had not been successful, including if our [U.S.] team hadn’t been credible, I’m not sure how quickly things would have developed. Certainly we wouldn’t have been able to start Major League Soccer at that time if the World Cup wasn’t successful.”\n\nAnother rarely discussed — but hugely important — legacy of that tournament is the foundation it created in terms of experience and expertise. The U.S. had never staged a major standalone soccer competition before 1994 and the learning curve was steep. Among those who worked under Rothenberg and went on to great success in the sport were Sunil Gulati, a three-term president of U.S. Soccer; Nelson Rodriguez, now MLS executive vice-president; Marla Messing, who headed the organizing committee for the 1999 Women’s World Cup and was later interim commissioner of the NWSL; Tom King, U.S. Soccer’s longtime managing director of administration; Kathy Carter, the former executive vice-president of Soccer United Marketing and chief executive officer of U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Properties; and Charlie Stillitano, a former MLS general manager who pioneered the idea of inviting major European clubs to play summer friendlies in the U.S.\n\n“It's not just that the event [came] off. Look what came out of it,” said Scott LeTellier, who as managing director and chief operating officer had responsibility for day-to-day operations of the World Cup organizing committee for 1994. “All the people who worked on our committee, who had some role that now are general managers of MLS teams. The league itself that came out of it. The number of soccer facilities. We didn't have a single soccer specific-stadium in the country.\n\n“You can argue that the ‘94 World Cup was really the linchpin to that entire explosion in the sport.”\n\nThat tournament was ahead of its time in other ways too. It was the first to stage fan fests in host cities, the first to include musical performers at the final and the first to offer hospitality packages with the price of a ticket. It also featured a lavish opening ceremony, one that featured Diana Ross, Oprah Winfrey and President Clinton, turning what was just a soccer tournament into a global spectacle.\n\nThe World Cup hasn’t been the same since, with FIFA’s revenue growing to a projected $13 billion for the 2026 cycle. There are more than 40 countries that don’t have an economy that large.\n\nAs Rothenberg notes in his book, FIFA originally pushed back on many of the innovations he proposed, including a halftime show at the final, only to eventually adopt the ideas as their own. Rothenberg also wanted to charge $1,000 a ticket for the final in 1994, arguing that fans would pay that on the secondary market, so why let the scalpers make the profit?\n\n“They were horrified,” he said. “You realize what a dramatic statement it would make if you had a $100-million gate?”\n\nThey do now; the cheapest regular tickets for the final of this summer’s tournament start at $2,000.\n\nRothenberg said he’s still thinking of other ways to improve the tournament, such as expanding the field to 64 teams and doing away with the group stage, making the World Cup like the NCAA basketball tournament.\n\n“I know I’m off the charts on this one,” he said. “Single elimination. It’s exciting start to finish.”\n\nAt 86, Rothenberg is still active, making regular trips to his office at 1st Century Bank, the community bank he founded in 2004 at an age when most people were entering retirement. And he promises to be a presence at this summer’s World Cup.\n\nAs for whether he gets the credit he deserves for making that tournament possible, Rothenberg demurs.\n\n“I didn’t do it for credit,” he says, speaking about both the World Cup and the book that explains how it happened. “All I can say is I’m proud of what I did.”\n\n⚽ You have read the latest installment of On Soccer with Kevin Baxter.

    "fullText": "The Arizona Cardinals had a lot of injuries this year.\n\nThey leaned on those injuries as an excuse for why this team was 3-14, that 14 losses is the most in franchise history.\n\nThe Cardinals lost some talent, that is not a question, it is a fact. However, they also had less high end talent lost than a lot of teams.\n\nTake for example the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThe last two games the 49ers have given up 13 points to the Seattle Seahawks in a battle for the top seed in the NFC, and 19 points in a Wild Card win over the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThe Niners in that game had this group starting:\n\nLine – Bryce Huff, Jordan Elliot, Sam Okuayinonu, Kalia Davis\nLB – Eric Kendricks, Tatum Bethune, Dee Winters\nDB – Renardo Green, Deommodore Lenoir, Malik Mustapha, Ji’Ayir Brown\n\nWhat is impressive is that only Jordan Elliot and Dee Winters were starters along the front seven at the beginning of the year.\n\nWhile they lost the game against the Seahawks, they held the third best scoring offense in the NFL to 13 points. They averaged 28.4 points per game.\n\nAgainst the Eagles in a game to prolong their season, they went to Philadelphia and beat an Eagles team that wasn’t the same as last year, but it is still a team that averaged 23.9 points per game at home this season, in the cold. They held Saquon Barkley to 4 yards per carry. They held Jalen hurts to 168 yards passing.\n\nSaleh took a group that likely will get blown out next game, but found a way to not just be competitive, but win.\n\nJonathan Gannon was resigned to giving up 35 points per game in their nine game losing streak, talking about injuries and just not coaching them up enough.\n\nMaybe behind closed doors, Gannon was a fiery guy who inspired his team. On the field and in the public eye, outside of one time with Emari Demercado, Gannon seemed indifferent. Never too high, never too low, just a guy who wanted his guys out there to have a great time, and get their orange slices and juice boxes after the game.\n\nThere was no fight. Fans looked more engaged than the players.\n\nWith Saleh, maybe he is not the guy, maybe his overall work as a leader won’t work even in its second go around, but he sure as hell is showing he knows how to motivate and get players to play hard and together.",

    "description": "In order to defeat the Buffalo Bills, the Denver Broncos need to accomplish these three things on Saturday.",
    "fullText": "It’s playoff déjà vu for the Denver Broncos who host the Buffalo Bills in the Divisional Round of the playoffs on Saturday. After a successful regular season, the Broncos are hoping to avoid being one-and-done and continue their chase for the franchise’s fourth Lombardi Trophy. The Bills will be a formidable foe, and this will be a tough matchup. It’s certainly a game the Broncos can win, but in order to do so, they need to accomplish these three things.\n\nEstablish the run with Jaleel McLaughlin leading the way\n\nIn order to embark on a deep postseason push and defeat the Bills, the Broncos have to find a way to run the ball effectively. Keep in mind, the Bills controlled the clock for 41 minutes in last year’s playoff matchup. For that not to happen again, Denver has to pound the rock with success. Prior to J.K. Dobbins being injured, Denver had one of the more consistent running attacks in the National Football League. In his absence, things haven’t been as efficient as you would hope for.\n\nRookie second-round pick RJ Harvey has seen a significant uptick in snaps since then. While is touchdown performance during his rookie campaign has certainly been impressive, Harvey’s inconsistency as a runner has been inhibitive to the Broncos’ offensive endeavors in the latter half of the season. I don’t think it would be smart for him to be the lead back on Saturday.\n\nLeading up to their Week 18 matchup versus the Los Angeles Chargers, Head Coach Sean Payton had hinted at an increased role for veteran running back Jaleel McLaughlin. However, it was Harvey who had fifteen carries for just 28 yards to McLaughlin’s six that went for 41 yards. Those numbers coupled with the results of games prior show you exactly who has been the more effective runner.\n\nIt’s McLaughlin by a long shot. His vision and patience as a runner are superior to Harvey’s. He has made the most of his limited opportunities. The Bills’ biggest weakness on defense is stopping the run. I’m confident that Jaleel has the ability to be a difference maker in the game for Denver—as long as Payton affords him the opportunity to be one.\n\nI want to see more Jaleel McLaughlin come playoffs #BroncosCountry @MileHighReport pic.twitter.com/IBINh5hzOC\n\n— Ross (@Ross_MHR) January 6, 2026\n\nThe Broncos can’t afford to become their own worst enemy and beat themselves\n\nThe Broncos’ third and final loss of the regular season to the Jacksonville Jaguars could wind up being one of the biggest turning points for Denver’s season. While it’s never great to lose, derailing the lengthy winning streak may have served up some humble pie that the coaches and players needed in order to come back down to earth.\n\nIf they learned anything from that game, it’s how bad things can get when you beat yourselves. Against the Jaguars, the Broncos ran the gamut of self-inflicted wounds. I thought it was their most sloppy performance of the season. Untimely drops, multiple turnovers, a half dozen penalties, and poor third down success on both sides of the ball tanked Denver in that game.\n\nWhen things go that bad, brutal losses like that are usually the outcome. The Broncos have had an extra week to prepare for this game against the Bills. A good portion of last week was likely an introspective look as to what they can improve in-house to be best prepared for Saturday.\n\nCan the Broncos learn from their past mistakes and avoid them in the Divisional Round? Did they take to heart any lessons from last year’s early playoff exit? Whether or not they do will have a significant impact on the game ultimately ends up playing out.\n\nSean Payton is 4-0 in his career off a postseason bye\n\nHe’s won those 4 games by an average score of 31-17\n\nFunny enough, 31-17 was the score of his Super Bowl win, which of course is one of those 4 postseason games off a bye\n\n— Zach Segars (@Zach_Segars) January 12, 2026\n\nYou can’t let Josh Allen become the ultimate X-Factor in the game\n\nJosh Allen’s ascent from a rough around the edge’s rookie out of Wyoming to one of the greatest quarterbacks in the NFL has been fun to witness. Unfortunately, it’s with Allen leading the Bills as opposed to the Broncos. Something which many of you loyal readers had hoped for years ago when the Broncos ultimately passed on him for Bradley Chubb. Alas, I guess there is no sense crying over spilled milk.\n\nAll that matters now is Defensive Coordinator Vance Joseph and his players coming up with and execute a gameplan that limits his incredible on the field ability as a passer and runner. Last year on Wild Card Weekend, Allen was 20-of-26 for 272 yards and 2 touchdowns as a passer and added 8 rushes for 46 yards. The Bills’ offense trounced Denver’s defense and accrued 26 total first downs.\n\nThat sort of dominant performance can’t happen again this time around. The Broncos will enjoy the perks of homefield advantage in front of a sellout crowd who will be cheering their hearts out. I think the noise factor can help disrupt the rhythm of their offense. Nevertheless, Denver’s defensive front seven are going to have to play disciplined, not over pursue on their rushes, and find a way to keep Allen from scrambling and making chunk plays with his legs.\n\nStopping playoff Josh Allen isn’t easy, but Denver’s defense has shown time and time again this season they can come up clutch when it matters most. Limiting Allen’s impact on the game will certainly be important if the Broncos want to hose the AFC Championship game next weekend.\n\nJosh Allen – ELITE playoff performer ⭐ pic.twitter.com/njcP1PDjUb",

    "description": "Last season in 2025, JoJo Romero pitched 61 IP in 65 games, posting a 2.07 ERA and a 3.28 FIP. Those are strong marks for a full-season reliever. The part of JoJo’s game that leaves a question mark is the swing and miss.",
    "fullText": "Last season in 2025, JoJo Romero pitched 61 IP in 65 games, posting a 2.07 ERA and a 3.28 FIP. Those are strong marks for a full-season reliever. The part of JoJo’s game that leaves a question mark is the swing and miss. Only a 21.6 K% and an 11.4 BB% will give acquiring teams a little bit of pause when assessing what level of ask is reasonable in return.\n\nOn Thursday, Romero and the Cardinals agreed to a one-year, $ 4.26 million contract for the 2026 season. This allowed the Cardinals to avoid an arbitration hearing in his final season of team control. This is somewhat noteworthy considering Romero was coming off a season in which FanGraphs credited Romero with 7.1 million in Value for his performance. That gives about 2.5 to 3 million in surplus value. That’s not much, but it should be enough to net the Cardinals a 40 FV pitching prospect from a lefty reliever-needy squad.\n\nWe’ve seen a handful of decent lefty relievers traded this offseason, Matt Strahm, Angel Zerpa, and Jose A. Ferrer, just to name a few. JoJo Romero doesn’t have quite the level of performance of Strahm, nor does he have the years of control that Zerpa or Ferrer possess. But, given what’s remaining on the free agent market after a crop of intriguing lefties have come off the board, 38-year-old Justin Wilson (whose considering retirement) remains at the top with lefty specialist Ryan Borucki. You can reasonably assert that JoJo Romero would remain as the top option from the left side available, and there are 6 teams I identified as possible fits for JoJo.\n\nI’m going to use FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching) as my north star towards a potential landing spot. In 2025, JoJo Romero posted a 3.28 FIP, as I mentioned earlier. I will also point out a couple of prospects who fall in the 35+ to 40+ FV range that the Cardinals could be intrigued by as a return.\n\n6. Athletics – 2025 LHRP FIP: 3.71\n\nAfter losing Sean Newcomb to free agency, the only other remaining LHRP option is Hogan Harris. For an Athletics team that is on the rise, you don’t need glasses to see the next great A’s team coming. Playing in a very competitive AL West, the A’s could use a little more firepower at the back end of their games, and JoJo would be a nice fit for them. Adding Romero to the trio of Harris, Sterner, and Mark Leiter Jr, whom they signed earlier this offseason, would surely help them secure a few more games in 2026.\n\nEduarniel Nunez (#34) FB – 60 CB – 70 Com – 20 FV – 35+\n\nA true modern-day RP prospect. Nunez possesses high-octane type stuff and also has very little control over where those pitches are going. Still, at the lower levels, the stuff was good enough to simply blow people away. Nunez would give the Cardinals’ pitching dev team another fun arm with big stuff to work with.\n\nJared Johnson (#26) FB – 55 SL – 60 Com – 40 FV – 40\n\nJohnson has a little less in the way of horsepower than Nunez does, but the floor to become an MLB contributor is higher, thanks to his better ability to command the ball. You could add Johnson to a growing pitching group in the upper minors that could contribute to the big league club in the near future.\n\n5. Baltimore Orioles – 2025 LHRP FIP: 4.17\n\nThis would be a fun landing spot. Considering the Orioles have already secured both Helsley and Kittredge this offseason, adding Romero, you would recreate the back-end trio that was so good for the 2024 Cardinals. Baltimore has plenty of high leverage options from the right side, but their returning lefty group includes Keegan Akin and Dietrich Enns, and while those two are interesting pieces, in an absolute blood bath of an AL East, you will want as much certainty as possible.\n\nCameron Foster (#38) FB – 55 SL – 60 CB – 50 CUT – 55 Com – 40 FV – 40\n\nFoster dominated Double-A last season with a 1.01 ERA in 26.2 IP before being moved up to Triple-A and being moved to Baltimore from New York at the trade deadline. Foster’s Triple-A performance was really solid in 13 IP down the stretch with the Norfolk Tide, and he was added to the 40-man this offseason to protect from the Rule 5 draft. A solid 4 pitch mix with some middle relief upside would make for a solid target in return for Romero.\n\nAnthony Nunez (#26) FB – 45 SL – 70 CH – 50 CUT – 55 Com – 60 FV 40+\n\nNunez Slider is the obvious outlier, and his ability to command his pitch mix gives him a really nice floor and high probability to make an MLB debut at some point in 2026. Nunez flew through 3 levels of the Mets system before being dealt to Baltimore at the deadline, where he encountered his first bit of challenge at Triple-A, as most pitchers do, and was also added to the 40-man roster this offseason.\n\n4. Miami Marlins – 2025 LHRP FIP: 4.47\n\nMiami has signaled a willingness to increase payroll as the threat of a CBA looms, and they’ve added St. Louisan Pete Fairbanks to the back end of their bullpen this offseason. After a 2nd half surge that saw them nearly finish the season at .500, Miami feels it’s getting closer to being competitive once more with a strong 1-2 punch at the top of their rotation, and more young pitching getting close now would feel like a good time to strike and strengthen their pen a little bit further. Cade Gibson was solid for Miami from the left side last season, but they could use a clear upgrade over Josh Simpson, who posted a 7.34 ERA and 5.35 FIP in 30.2 IP. Adding Romero to Fairbanks and Bender at the back end of games would give Miami a nice formula to win games in 2026.\n\nNate Payne (#25) FB – 45 SL – 60 CB – 60 Com – 45 FV – 40\n\nAn 18th Rd pick in 2024, Payne had a solid debut season, making 17 starts across the 2 lowest levels of the minors last season. In 56.2 IP, he posted a 3.20 ERA and a 3.27 FIP. Payne displays an above-average ability to spin the baseball and wind up as a swingman type in the big leagues, assuming he can maintain command of his breaking stuff, and for an 18th Rd pick thats a win.\n\nJosh Ekness (#18) FB – 70 SL – 55 Com – 40 FV – 40+\n\nAfter spending the majority of the season in Double-A, Ekness got a short cup of coffee in Triple-A last season. In 43 games at Double-A, Ekness pitched to a 2.73 ERA and 2.50 FIP with a 28.1 K% and a 9.8 BB%. That performance, along with a 70-grade fastball, will catch attention. While Ekness will likely spend the entirety of 2026 in Triple-A, he has future high-leverage reliever written all over him, and the Cardinals would do well to get him as a return for Romero.\n\n3. Minnesota Twins – 2025 LHRP FIP: 4.51\n\nThe Twins front office group wants to compete in 2026, and they have a very young and intriguing team to do so with. The Rotation featuring Pablo Lopez, Joe Ryan, Taj Bradley, Bailey Ober, and Mick Abel/Matt Festa gives them a chance to win every night. Their offense centered around Byron Buxton and Royce Lewis, and the eventual arrival of top prospects Walker Jenkins and Emmanuel Rodriguez. They could sneak their way into the wild card picture if health stays in their favor. Danny Coulombe was nails for Minnesota in 2025, but he is a free agent and likely searching for a more established contender to pitch for. Kody Funderburk is the only other lefty in the pen remaining, and while he was solid in 2025, if the Twins want to raise their floor, they could use a little more certainty at the back end of their pen. That’s where JoJo would come in.\n\nPierson Ohl (#27) FB – 35 SL – 45 CH – 60 Com – 70 FV – 40\n\nOhl has already made his MLB debut and has options remaining. This would give the Cardinals an instant Memphis shuttle option with a lot of control remaining. The Twins Righty likely will never factor into the late-inning or leverage picture in a big league bullpen, but if the Cardinals want a safe-floor reliever they could install immediately, Ohl wouldn’t be a bad choice.\n\nTravis Adams (#26) FB – 50 SL – 55 CH – 45 CUT – 50 Com – 50 FV – 40\n\nAnother pitcher who made his debut in 2026, Travis Adams, is a classic pitch mix righty with the possibility of pitching in multiple roles. In 18 games in September, the Twins used Adams a lot, and his results weren’t the best at the end of a long season. However, in 68.2 IP in AAA this season, Adams posted a 3.93 ERA and 3.71 FIP along with a 22 K% and a 7.9 BB%. Again, an MLB-ready optionable reliever is probably something the Cardinals would like to receive in return as they accumulate as much pitching depth as possible.\n\n2. New York Yankees – 2025 LHRP FIP: 4.57\n\nIn 2025, the Yankees relied on a trio of lefties in Tim Hill, Brent Headrick, and Ryan Yarborough out of the pen. While Tim Hill is solid and reliable, as is Ryan Yarborough, though he might likely start the season in the rotation as they wait for Gerrit Cole, Carlos Rodon, and Clarke Schmidt to return from injuries mid season. The Yankees have David Bednar and Camilo Doval at the back of their bullpen, but could probably benefit from a more established lefty with high-leverage experience in a tough AL East, where every marginal advantage will be required to win the division.\n\nCarson Coleman (#23) FB – 70 SL – 40 Com – 35 FV – 40\n\nColeman pitched 17 innings across 3 minor league levels acrruing a 1.59 ERA and a 2.17 FIP. He was a Rule 5 selection in 2024 of the Texas Rangers, but was later returned to New York and missed the last 2 seasons due to injury. He was finally healthy enough down the stretch of 2025 to make up for some lost time in those 17 IP at the end of 2025. Coleman will likely be heading into 2026 looking to have strong performances in the upper minors to push him towards a potential debut in the near future as the clock continues to tick on the 27-year-old righty.\n\nMichael Arias (#19) FB – 60 SL – 55 CH – 60 Com – 30 FV – 40\n\nThe toolbox is full of effective weapons for Arias, but the command of it all continues to frustrate the organization’s he’s worked with. A heavy Sinker with good velo and a true difference maker of a changeup allows Arias to have success against both handednesses of hitters, when he has command, of course. The upside of a leverage reliever exists in the range of outcomes for Arias, and perhaps the Cardinals’ pitching dev team can help him get to a place with his command that he takes that next step forward to propel him to a big league role.\n\n1. Arizona Diamondbacks – 2025 LHRP FIP: 4.58\n\nAfter the D-backs were unable to consummate a Ketel Marte trade this offseason, Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic noted in his story that Arizona is turning its attention to a RHH first baseman and relief help. The rumored return of franchise face Paul Goldschmidt is something that would seem to make a lot of sense for what the Snakes are looking for. JoJo Romero would be another name that would fit into their reported remaining offseason wish list. With AJ Puk recovering from Tommy John surgery, Jalen Beeks a free agent, and Kyle Bachus being traded to the Phillies earlier this offseason. The lone remaining lefty reliever is Andrew Saalfrank, and in an NL West division that features lefty sluggers like Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman, Max Muncy, Rafael Devers, and Jackson Merrill, among others. It would seem like a solid investment to add some additional firepower to the back end of a promising roster that’s hopeful to compete in 2026.\n\nHayden Durke (#31) FB – 60 SL – 60 CRV – 55 Com- 40 FV – 40\n\nDurke is a close to MLB-ready reliever with some really nice offerings to boot! Another guy in this article who rose multiple levels in 2025 and wound up hitting a little bit of a roadblock at AAA. Durke pitched 49 innings last season across 3 levels, posting a 4.22 ERA and 3.45 FIP with 34.9 K% and 16.5 BB%. The strikeout stuff is there, but the walk rate ballooned at AAA, which isn’t uncommon for guys whose first taste of the big league ball can lend itself to some struggles with command. Overall, a really nice relief prospect with high leverage upside.\n\nBrian Curley (#23) FB – 60 SL – 55 CRV – 55 Com – 45 FV – 40\n\nCurley was taken in the 3rd round of the draft in 2025, number 92 overall, out of the University of Georgia, and Curley could start or relieve in pro ball. As a relief prospect out of the SEC, he could probably rise quickly and be an impact reliever in the near future. His path as a starter would likely take an additional year or two, but starters always carry more value than relievers, so the Cardinals could opt to be patient and see if he can add to their promising crop of high-end starting prospects.\n\nI believe there would be enough motivation for these 6 teams to engage the Cardinals about JoJo Romero, and I also believe there is a reasonable price point out there that both sides could agree to that benefits both sides. The Cardinals ultimately could carry the Lefty reliever into the season and see if he can have a monster first half and flip him at the trade deadline if opposing teams don’t see the value in Romero. JoJo appears to be the best-known lefty reliever remaining, and time is ticking for front offices to have their squads ready for spring training that is now just right around the corner. The Cardinals are in a good position from a leverage standpoint and can hold a firm ask without being unreasonable.",

    "fullText": "Virat Kohli isn’t arrogant, says India star Ajinkya Rahane, but his focus is misconstrued by others.\n\nAjinkya Rahane has stepped forward to challenge the persistent claims of arrogance levelled at Virat Kohli, offering a perspective from someone who has seen the former India captain’s routines up close.\n\nA teammate of Kohli’s during the latter’s time as Indian captain, Rahane explained that Kohli’s intense focus before matches is a sign of discipline and preparation, not ego.\n\nSpeaking to Cricbuzz, Ajinkya Rahane described how Kohli’s pre-match habits — including isolating himself and listening to music — are part of a process that helps him get into the right mental space.\n\nRahane also praised Kohli’s work ethic, saying it’s his constant drive to improve that sets him apart from others.\n\n“He’ll hardly talk with people, even with the teammates. That’s what actually gets him into the zone. People outside think Virat is arrogant, but he is not. He gets into the zone.”\n\n“His attitude is amazing. His work ethics are amazing. He always wants to change, improve, and contribute for the team,” Rahane said.\n\nVirat Kohli’s career has been defined by the level of effort, commitment, and focus he has brought to every team and every format of the game.\n\nKohli’s focus has been a talking point among fans and critics for years, but teammates have often described it as a key part of his success.\n\nNow playing only limited-overs cricket, Kohli recently became the second-highest run-scorer in international history, with 28,068 runs, following a 93-run innings against New Zealand.\n\nRahane’s comments echo what many within the Indian setup have said before: Kohli’s intensity is often misread, but it’s that same approach that has helped him build one of the most impressive careers in modern cricket.",

    "description": "Despite playoff heartbreak, two of the Green Bay Packers' stars seem to sense \"unfinished business\" for this team in 2026.",
    "fullText": "The stink of the way the Green Bay Packers ended the 2025 season is still in the air, but eventually, we're all going to have to move on.\n\nThe way the Packers lost to the Bears in the Wild Card round, blowing a 21-3 halftime lead, will go down in history as one of the worst playoff losses not just in Packers' history, but in the history of the NFL. For the Packers, it's absolutely right up there with the 2014 NFC Championship game.\n\nTime heals all wounds, though, and sooner or later fans are going to start getting excited for the 2026 season.\n\nFor the players on the team, that time has already come. They don't have the luxury of wallowing in pity because their preparations this offseason will play a big role in what they're able to accomplish in 2026.\n\nIt's worth noting that there are a lot of question marks for this team heading into 2026. There are players that will be lost in free agency, there's not a first round pick to work with in the NFL Draft, and heck, head coach Matt LaFleur may not even be the coach next year. It's trending that way, but anything can happen.\n\nDespite the recent heartbreak and despite the uncertainties, it's worth noting that several Packers seemed optimistic about how things will look in 2026. Many of them had a chance to speak at locker cleanout on Monday, and the vibe can best be described as \"unfinished business\".\n\n“Yeah, he told me that,” star defensive end Micah Parsons said when it was brought up that defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley believes he'll break the NFL's sack record next season, per Matt Schneidman of The Athletic. “He’s putting a lot of pressure on me. I’m not scared of those challenges, either. They know I’m coming. I had a little fun with Myles (Garrett). He talked about (how) he’s going to put the trophy, the Defensive Player of the Year trophy, in the training room so we can look at it (Parsons and Garrett train together in the offseason). I said, ‘You know what, don’t worry. The light’s bright, but the sun always sets, too, so we’re coming.’ It’s always great that you’ve got a coach like that. Me and Haf has a great relationship … he’s another guy I can’t wait to have another year with.”\n\nNotably, Parsons is speaking like Hafley will be back in 2026, but head coach Matt LaFleur seemed to believe that the defensive coordinator will be a head coach somewhere next season.\n\n\"I fully anticipate Hafley's going to do a great job on the interview and I fully anticipate him getting one of these,\" LaFleur said Sunday, according to PackersWire.\n\n“Nah, Haf ain’t going nowhere,\" Parsons said on Monday.\n\nThe Packers, unfortunately, lost star tight end Tucker Kraft in early November to a torn ACL. To that point, he was having an elite season and was clearly becoming one of the rising superstars in the NFL.\n\nIn just eight games, Kraft caught 32 passes for 489 yards and six touchdowns.\n\nHe was on-pace for an All-Pro season, and it's worth noting that he does feel good about where he'll be recovery-wise at the start of 2026.\n\n“My timeline, I’m not in a race or anything like that. It happened. By the time Week 1 rolls around, I’ll be 10 months post-surgery and hopefully bulletproofed by then,” Kraft said. “I already feel pretty good. My progress so far has been great. Some would say even ahead of schedule. So, not trying to blow anything out of proportion. I’m not even 10 weeks in yet, but it’s feeling good so far. Everything’s going great. I’m in good hands here.”\n\nIf Kraft comes back healthy in 2026, there's reason to believe he can be an All-Pro.",

    "title": "Notre Dame Portal Scouting Report: Cornerback DJ McKinney",
    "description": "Tall, long, and fast, DJ McKinney brings proven coverage skills and physicality to Notre Dame's secondary. A dynamic corner ready to make an impact.",
    "fullText": "Notre Dame returns a talented secondary in 2026 but the Irish coaching staff has added even more talent and experience to the room by landing Colorado transfer corner DJ McKinney. The Texas native is entering his fifth and final season in college football and he'll spend it playing with the Irish.\n\nLet's look at the scouting report for McKinney.\n\nSchool: Colorado\nHeight/Weight: 6-2, 180\n\n2025 Stats: 35 tackles, 1 INT, 5 break ups\n2024 Stats: 62 tackles, 3 INT (1 TD), 9 break ups, 1 FF\n2023 Stats: 38 tackles, 5 break ups\n\nAnalysis: We all know that Mike Mickens loves tall, long, fast cornerbacks and that's what Notre Dame got in McKinney. He's 6-2 and very long, which from a frame standpoint makes him a good fit in the Irish defense. McKinney is listed at just 180 pounds but he plays with good strength. He's a quality tackler that is willing to deliver good hits on backs, to get off blocks and he plays with some physicality working downfield in coverage.\n\nMcKinney shows impressive speed on film, which combines quite well with his length to allow him to cover a lot of ground. By impressive speed I don't just mean he's long and rangy, which allows him to cover a lot of ground. McKinney certainly has that, but he also has legit long speed. McKinney shows relatively smooth hips and the ability to quickly flip his hips and get vertical. His change of direction skills are good and he can do everything movement wise that Notre Dame needs from its cornerbacks to play at a high level.\n\nAs a cover player he combines all that length and athleticism with a good feel for the position. He's instinctive, he uses his length to get his hands on a lot of throws (14 break ups the last two seasons) and he uses his range to drive on the ball well. He understands angles and leverage once he gets down the field and his mirror skills are impressive. McKinney has some footwork issues in press man and when planting and driving in Cover 3 that need to be improved. He'll also struggle at times with a good receiver stem that goes at his leverage, causing him to overplay the top end move. He'll need to clean that up at Notre Dame.\n\nOverall, McKinney is very talented from a size and athleticism standpoint, and his feel for the coverage game is quite good. He's a willing tackler, usually, but he doesn't always take good angles to the ball and his effort can be a bit inconsistent. He was much better in this area in 2024 than he was in 2025, so I question if he was fully healthy this season. There is a lot of talent here to work with, and getting a year to work with someone like Mickens could pay huge dividends for him.\n\nNotre Dame Fit: Colorado plays their cornerbacks left-right, which means McKinney has played both field and boundary at times. He's spent the vast majority of his 2,000-plus career snaps playing outside, although he does have a handful of slot snaps in his career. For Notre Dame, I expect McKinney to play field cornerback, although he has the tools to play in the boundary if the need arises. I could see him fitting in at nickel in certain situations, but I prefer him to be an outside cornerback.\n\nAt Colorado he played a combination of man and zone, and with Notre Dame looking to utilize more zone under Chris Ash this experience could prove helpful. Mickens likes instinctive corners that get their hands on a lot of passes and McKinney certainly has those skills. If he can be more consistent with his technique and focus he has a chance to be quite impactful as either a starter at field cornerback or as a top rotation player.\n\nBecome a premium Irish Breakdown member, which grants you access to all of our premium content and our premium message board!

    "fullText": "While he has not matched Tiger Woods’ peak, Scottie Scheffler is still breaking new ground in golf.\n\nHe may not be at the same level as Tiger just yet, but there is little doubt he is the closest thing we have seen to Woods since his heyday.\n\nScheffler has now won 19 times on the PGA Tour and has four majors to his name. At 29, those numbers are already impressive.\n\nIt is a tall order to reach Tiger’s mark of 15 major championships and 82 PGA Tour victories, but Scheffler looks as well-prepared as anyone to give it a serious go.\n\nThe comparisons are not coming from nowhere either. Plenty of players on tour have already started linking him with Tiger in casual conversation.\n\nScheffler still has work to do to reach the top, but even the early comparisons speak volumes about how good he has become.\n\nTiger Woods owns the record for the most weeks spent as world number one, holding that position for an astonishing 683 weeks.\n\nScheffler is nowhere near that figure yet, but he could realistically target Woods’ streak of 281 consecutive weeks at number one.\n\nTo match that run, Scheffler needs to stay on top for another two years and 266 days – a long stretch, but not out of reach given his current form.\n\nIf he can hold onto it through to October 5th, 2028, he will move past a milestone that has stood since 2010.\n\nIn many ways, that consecutive streak might be Woods’ most remarkable achievement. Staying on top for over five years without interruption is an extraordinary feat in any era.\n\nAnd given how dominant Scheffler has been recently, it would not be shocking if he managed to hold onto number one well beyond that date – even into the next decade.\n\nHe is incredibly consistent off the tee and arguably stands as golf’s best iron player right now.\n\nEven putting – once seen as his main weakness – has turned into a real strength. On top of that, he has an excellent short game and might just be golf’s toughest competitor these days.\n\nDoes any part of that sound familiar?\n\nScheffler shares several traits with Tiger from his peak. The next decade could see him close in on more than a few records held by one golfer who set impossible standards over such a long period",

The kid went from being a tackle to a guard.” said offensive coordinator Matt Nagy in a recent press conference, “There’s the part of you think of a guy like Joe Thuney and at that position (and) at the guard position, Trey Smith, these guys know the communication side of it, of what they’re doing with that part that sometimes never gets talked about, that communication side.”\n\nSuamataia started all 17 games at left guard in 2025, serving as one of the few consistent and available players during the season.\n\n“The physical side is what we all see on TV and what we all see on film, but what about the mental side of the mistakes or the things that you’re doing well that you can see,” said Nagy, “That’s where I think he has really grown there. The confidence is there, and he needs to just keep that going. The kid has the ability to be really special, and that’s just a credit to (General Manager Brett) Veach and (Head) Coach (Andy) Reid for bringing a guy like that in here.”\n\nThe former BYU standout finished with the most pass block snaps played at guard, according to Pro Football Focus. He will be a stabilizing force on the starting offensive line for a Chiefs team hoping for efficiency and availability heading into next season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Chiefs OL Kingsley Suamataia displayed growth in sophomore season",

He’s getting the clap off the Kop and I don’t know if that maybe went to his head. We can joke about it now but it’s unacceptable to lose a goal like that. Dom obviously knows that.\n\n“He’s been magnificent for us this season and he was again really good. He just had a lapse of concentration, and we can’t afford too many of them in the six-yard box.\n\n“I don’t think Gio [Mamardashvili] was too happy. He wants to keep a clean sheet, the defence wants to keep a clean sheet as well, so it wasn’t great. It gave them a way back in and it was 2-1 for a long time. It made it a bit nervy but we got there in the end.\"\n\nRobertson said the Liverpool team had a few choice words with Szoboszlai, adding: “I think we all said something at the time, but he realised and apologised at half-time.\n\n“If anyone's performances can’t get criticised this season, it’s Dom’s. He’s been 100 per cent every game this season and has this lapse of concentration which isn’t great. We can’t really afford that in the so-called bigger games.\"",

    "description": "Philadelphia 76ers guard Kyle Lowry reiterates his plan to retire as a member of the Toronto Raptors in his potential final return \"home\".",
    "fullText": "TORONTO -- As Philadelphia 76ers guard Kyle Lowry gets set to finish out his 20th season in the NBA, the future Hall of Famer just wrapped up what could have been his final trip back to Toronto.\n\nLowry spent nine fantastic years in Toronto where he was named an All-Star six times and helped guide the franchise to a championship in 2019. When it's all said and done, he will be considered one of the best players in Raptors history--if not the best.\n\nAs he walked onto the Scotiabank Arena on Monday night with the Sixers wrapping up a win over the Raptors, Lowry received a standing ovation and a lot of love from an appreciative Toronto fan base. Afterward, an emotional Lowry opened up on his final minutes in Toronto.\n\n\"I had Trendon Watford next to me sitting on the bench and he was like ‘Come on Kyle! You gotta go in! Go in! Give them what they’re waiting for!’ and it’s cool to have teammates like that and to listen to the fans, and that’s why I always say, these are the greatest fans in the world to me,\" he said. \"They’ve been supportive of me in my career and a lot of the things I accomplished in my career was in front of these fans and that’s why this place is so special to me.\"\n\nLowry has said in the past that he wants to sign a one-day contract and retire as a member of the Raptors. When he returned to the Sixers in the 2025 offseason, one could have wondered if the plan changed, but he maintains that he will, in fact, sign that one-day deal when the time comes.\n\n\"Oh, yeah,\" Lowry said pregame on Sunday. \"That's not—I said, you know that my goal, and I’m committed to this, and I will never go from what I say. I will sign a one-day contract and retire as a Raptor. That has not changed.\"\n\nAll love for Kyle Lowry 🤝 pic.twitter.com/6DtnBdA5Lz\n\n— Toronto Raptors (@Raptors) January 13, 2026\n\nWhen Lowry does retire, his No. 7 will certainly go into the rafters at Scotiabank Arena. There is no doubt about that. One has to wonder what the emotions will be like for the usually stoic Lowry in moments such as this.\n\n\"I don't know. Y’all ever see me cry?\" Lowry laughed. \"I don't know. It depends on how Matt, you know, says it, and we got Matt Devlin. He might, you know how he does it. He might be the emcee, but if it does and when it does, it will be a super emotional day. I put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears in that seven and to know the fact that it probably will never be worn again, it’ll be pretty special. I think something that for my basketball legacy is pretty, pretty, pretty darn cool.\"\n\nIt's obvious that Lowry is appreciated by the people in Canada and the feeling is mutual between Lowry and the Raptors. When Lowry does eventually hang up the sneakers, the future Hall of Famer will make sure his final days in the NBA will be as a member of that organization.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Sixers' Kyle Lowry reiterates plan to retire as member of the Raptors",

I think for a club to have a player that’s come through the academy and knows the club and feels it… I think Man United’s got to have an element of that. [They] always have done and always will.\n\n“I think to have a talent like he’s shown already, you’ve got to have players like that, where you say, ‘Right, they get it. They know it.’ Let’s help them, let’s build them and stick with them. There’s definitely a place for him there, for sure.”\n\n(Photo by Jan Kruger/Getty Images)\n\nAlas, supporters will be keeping a close eye on Carrick’s first few line-ups and whether Mainoo makes the cut – or whether he progressively reintroduces him to the action with increased minutes in the coming weeks, especially considering United’s next two fixtures are against Manchester City and league leaders Arsenal.\n\nMichael Carrick has already told former teammate which Man Utd player he wants to ‘build around’, fans will be delighted\n\n‘At Carrington to finalise deal’: Whitwell drops blockbuster Man Utd update on Tuesday morning\n\nMan Utd ready to send first-team star away for free after FA Cup elimination",

    "description": "PFF named Garett Bolles its Pass Blocker of the Year, and the Broncos' front five was named PFF's best offensive line.",
    "fullText": "Pro Football Focus recently announced its awards for the 2025 NFL season, including MVP, Offensive Player of the Year, and 18 other categories.\n\nPFF's staff gave the award for the best individual pass blocker to Denver Broncos left tackle Garett Bolles, who is perhaps coming off his best season yet in terms of his blocking ability.\n\n\"Denver’s Garett Bolles was a serious contender for Protector of the Year after a strong campaign, leading all offensive linemen in PFF pass-blocking grade (90.8) and ranking first among offensive tackles in pressure rate allowed (3.1%),\" PFF's staff wrote. \"He was also the only left tackle to play at least 230 pass-blocking snaps — logging 714 — without allowing a sack.\"\n\nBolles is coming off the first first-team All-Pro selection of his career, and he was also elected to the Pro Bowl.\n\nAs for the best offensive line in football, PFF recognized Denver as far and away the best unit in the game.\n\n\"Unlike last year, the Broncos' offensive line faced several injuries in 2025,\" PFF wrote. \"Left guard Ben Powers missed an extended period of time, while center Luke Wattenberg’s season ended early. However, the unit still performed well due to solid performances from Alex Palczewski at left guard and Alex Forsyth at center. For the second season in a row, the Broncos fielded the most efficient pass-blocking offensive line. Denver’s unit gave up 137 pressures, including a league-low six sacks, leading to an 89.5 PFF pass-blocking efficiency rating. The Broncos' line was the only unit to allow fewer than 13 sacks this season.\"\n\nDenver's unit looks to continue its dominance against the team that knocked them out of the playoffs in 2024, the Buffalo Bills, in the divisional round on Saturday. If they can keep everything in front of them, the Broncos have a fighting chance of winning their first playoff game since 2015.\n\nAfter the season, Bolles could be a candidate for the NFL's inaugural Protector of the Year Award. He's got PFF's support.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: Denver Broncos news: PFF names Garett Bolles Pass Blocker of the Year",

    "fullText": "For Notre Dame football, this transfer portal season has been more about the quality over the quantity of incoming players.\n\nThe Irish took over a week for them to land their first commitment, and they came in bunches, as four players committed on Monday morning. Two of them, defensive lineman Keon Keeley and wide receiver Quincy Porter, were former 5-star recruits.\n\nWhen you add in cornerbacks DJ McKinney and Jayden Sanders, the group of four has the top average of stars rankings in all of college football according to 247Sports Team Transfer Rankings. While I don’t think that Notre Dame ends up in this position, it’s a fantastic “start” after many were in a bit of angst awaiting the first commit.\n\nIt shouldn’t surprise many that this is currently happening though, as the Irish have recently had some great recruiting classes, and some very good portal classes. There have been some hits, misses and solid additions, but the quartet that Notre Dame got on Monday should set them up for a few more big time additions.\n\nNotre Dame officially has 4 commitments out of the transfer portal. That ranks them at 16th.

    "description": "Caleb Williams and Ben Johnson shifted the balance of power in the Bears-Packers rivalry with a thrilling playoff win",
    "fullText": "The Cardiac Bears showed that the regular season was no fluke. They can do it in the playoffs, too. Caleb Williams and the Bears delivered one of the best Bears playoff wins in franchise history, and the first playoff win since 2011.\n\nHere are my takeaways from another thrilling Bears win over the Green Bay Packers:\n\nSince Caleb Williams has been in Chicago, he has gone 3-2 versus the Packers. In every game he has played, it has been a thrilling Bears vs Packers match. His two games last season versus the Packers both ended by a field goal. The first one was a blocked field goal after Caleb Williams drove the Bears down the field. In the next game, Caleb Williams set up another game-winning drive. This time around, Cairo made it, and the Bears won at Lambeau Field. This year, Ben Johnson and Caleb Williams, after a loss by one play, went on to beat the Packers twice in drastic fashion. Caleb Williams threw the game-winning touchdown in overtime to D.J. Moore. Caleb Williams, then, in the playoffs against Green Bay, sent them packing with a 25-point fourth quarter and overcame an 18-point deficit. For the first time, not only do the Bears have a chance every time they face off against the Packers, but they have a coach and quarterback who play at their best against the Packers. Ben Johnson and Caleb Williams do not shrivel up in these games. Caleb Williams looked like what Aaron Rodgers was to the Bears, now against the Packers. It has been a special turnaround in just two seasons. The Bears have to be extremely confident that they have now turned this rivalry all the way around. Caleb Williams and Ben Johnson have made this rivalry exactly what it should be, and they now look like they are trying to become owners of the Packers instead of the other way around.\n\nIt is one thing to be elite and have game-winning drives during the regular season, but to carry that into the playoffs against your biggest rival, you are a different type of clutch. Jordan Love threw 4 passing touchdowns and made no mistakes in this game, but the Bears won this football game because they had the better quarterback. Caleb threw for 195 yards and two touchdowns in the 4th quarter alone. He led the Bears to 25 points in the 4th quarter as well. It was a sports-movie-level performance down the stretch. Caleb Williams saved his best heroics for the biggest game of his career. Not many quarterbacks can do that; in fact, maybe just the elite quarterbacks that are known as the big 4. No more room for doubt, Caleb Williams is the guy.\n\nFrom both the offensive side of the ball to the defensive side of the ball their is no team that is better than the Bears. There have been many instances where Ben Johnson is out coaching the other coaching staff in the second half and, most importantly, the 4th quarter. Matt Lafleur called a great game in the first half, and the Packers were clicking on all cylinders, resulting in them being up 21-3. In the second half, it was a completely different story, and both Dennis Allen and Ben Johnson got the best out of Lafleur.\n\nJust like the USC Trojans all college football season long, completely changing their defense in the second half and giving up essentially nothing to their opponent, the Bears did the same exact thing. The Bears' defense looked like it was going to be another day where they were not going to be able to get a stop in the 1st half. In the second half, they registered 4 straight 3 and outs and were the more impressive unit in this game. If they do not get those stops, the Bears do not win this football game. Losing T.J. Edwards in the first half to a gruesome injury, it would have been understandable for this defense to throw in the towel, losing their quarterback of the defense. Instead, they did the opposite. They got pressure on the quarterback with blitzes, and Montez Sweat and Austin Booker both were consistently in the backfield. Kyler Gordon was not 100 percent, but when he was on the field, he made a difference. This was a game that gave great confidence that the Bears' defense can step up and be good enough to go on a deep playoff run.\n\nIt seems like the only way teams can beat the Bears is if they are perfect in the 4th quarter. You cannot give this team any bit of confidence by making mental mistakes and giving the ball into their hands. No lead feels safe with the Chicago Bears, no matter how much time is left. There is a sense of belief, and there is just a confidence that they can achieve the impossible. That makes them a very dangerous team. In some of these late-game heroic wins, it feels exactly like the Bears are achieving the impossible every time. You cannot take your foot off the pedal, and you cannot make mental mistakes. Game after game, that is exactly what costs teams that face the Bears. It will be interesting to see whether or not an experienced and well-coached football team like the Rams is the Cardiac Bears' next victim.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Key reasons for Chicago Bears and Caleb Williams beating Packers",

    "description": "Two of the NFL's least successful teams are working with multiple first round picks in 2026. How could Cleveland and New York fix things?",
    "fullText": "For three quarters of the NFL, the 2026 offseason has begun. That means Super Bowl hopes and dreams have been replaced by scouting reports and salary cap debates.\n\nThat means, for 24 teams, it's draft season.\n\nThe 2026 NFL Draft is modest when it comes to quarterback talent but still loaded with players who can change the fortunes of a franchise. Pass rushers, wideouts, cornerbacks and reinforcements on both sides of the trenches are waiting to hear their names called in April. Let's see who fits where and make some educated guesses.\n\nPlease note this draft was completed before Monday night's Wild Card game between the Houston Texans and Pittsburgh Steelers, so draft position among the top 24 picks was determined using the betting spread of that game (a projected three-point Texans win).\n\nGeno Smith can be kept for about $8 million more than his dead cap number. While he might be a useful veteran mentor, he's also the guy who flipped off his home fans in his first year in Las Vegas, so... Aidan O'Connell will probably be the experienced (well, kinda) hand that turns things over to a polished rookie next August.\n\nMendoza's elite downfield accuracy means he'll dazzle when it comes to advanced stats like completion percentage over expected (CPOE). He balances pinpoint throws with strong, quick decision making and enough athleticism to keep defenses wary of his run game. While he lacks elite physical traits, you can't argue with his outcomes. Las Vegas needs a winner -- ideally immediately given how quickly it's cycled through head coaches. Mendoza has been wrecking shop at INDIANA.\n\nMoore has more physical tools in his box than Mendoza, but he's not as polished as the Heisman Trophy winner. Still, it's not difficult to see how a quick release and the arm strength to whip a deep shot through a rapidly closing window make him a tantalizing NFL prospect.\n\nThe Oregon star can break down under pressure and will need some time to acclimate to the NFL. Picking up a wideout with the pick acquired from the Colts in the Sauce Gardner trade (or, later on, the second round acquired from the Cowboys in the Quinnen Williams trade) could find him some badly needed receiving help to ease his transition.\n\nJosh Sweat was one of the few bright spots in Arizona last fall, racking up a career-high 12 sacks in his first season with the club. Only one other Cardinal had more than two, and that was 39-year-old Calais Campbell.\n\nArizona needs help just about everywhere but tight end. Reese's versatility can help him plug holes in a few places along the defense but most notably as a pass rusher. He had 10 tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks in his All-American 2025.\n\nTexas Tech stud David Bailey is worth a look here, but Bain's playoff performance is too fresh to ignore. The 6-foot-3, 275 pound edge rushing monster had 5.5 tackles for loss and four sacks in the Hurricanes' first two CFP games, setting the stage for a push even further up draft boards.\n\nHis get-off and closing speed hit like a series of small explosions, making him an absolute nightmare to block and a haunting presence to escape. The Titans badly need an influx of talent; Bain may be the best raw prospect of 2026.\n\nTate's ability to create space with savvy route running, strong hands and upper crust ball tracking would be a rising tide for New York's cache of young skill players. Malik Nabers' double-teams would drop. Cam Skattebo (and Tyrone Tracy, if he ever re-enters the circle of trust) would face fewer stacked boxes.\n\nAnd Jaxson Dart, importantly, would have more options downfield that don't require him to lower his shoulder and run face-first into the concussion protocol (he probably still will. He just won't *have* to). Wideout isn't the team's biggest need, but it could be the catalyst that revives an inefficient offense.\n\nThe Browns allowed pressure on a league-high 46.5 percent of their dropbacks -- four percent higher than the second-worst Chargers, who were missing their starting tackles most of the season. Four different linemen who played at least 69 percent of the team's snaps are set for free agency. Spending room is sparse, in large part thanks to Deshaun Watson, formerly accused of more than 20 counts of sexual misconduct and what the NFL described as \"predatory behavior,\" and his albatross contract.\n\nThe easiest fix is to find a dynamic starter on a rookie deal. Here, Cleveland has its choice. Fano gets the nod thanks to his absurd power and athleticism at 6-foot-6 and 305 pounds. That athleticism boosts his recovery when beaten, which will be an asset when squaring up with rookie mistakes and elite edge rushers.\n\nTerry McLaurin is locked in, but Jayden Daniels' targets get iffy after that. Deebo Samuel is a pending free agent. So is Zach Ertz, who is coming off a season-ending ACL tear. Daniels badly needs a boost after backsliding in 2025 due to injury and lackluster play.\n\nTyson is a jetpack. The Arizona State star is good at just about everything, but shines hardest when it comes to breaking off cornerbacks at the top of his route and creating the space for clutch pickups. Sticky hands and elite recognition make him a dynamic closer on 50/50 balls as well -- though he could stand to bulk up a bit to withstand the rigors of a 17-game season.\n\nNeeds: CB, IOL, EDGE, LB, RB, WR\n\nNew Orleans could have used Tate or Tyson. Taking a player like Makai Lemon or Denzel Boston could be a bit of a reach here. Good news! The Saints also need help at another position that would boost Tyler Shough after a promising rookie season.\n\nEnter Love, who'd be a boon to a tailback rotation that got below-average returns from Alvin Kamara and Devin Neal last fall. His value as a runner (nearly seven yards per carry the last two seasons) and receiver (280 yards, three touchdowns in 12 games this fall) give New Orleans a dynamic replacement for Kamara and rising tide to the offense, albeit at considerable expense for a running back.\n\nReleasing Jawaan Taylor could save up to $20 million in salary cap space for 2026. Jaylon Moore hasn't been great and is only under contract through 2026. Josh Simmons was uneven and injured as a rookie, though his ceiling is massive. After Patrick Mahomes faced pressure on at least 42 percent of his dropbacks in his final two games of his 2025 (two games that washed Kansas City out of the postseason race), the Chiefs reload to keep their star QB comfortable.\n\nMauigoa is a rampart in pass protection, but he's truly devastating in space where his 315-pound frame flies upfield to demolish poor, poor linebackers. He's in the running with Fano to be the first tackle off the board in 2026.\n\nTrey Hendrickson won't be coming back, leaving the league's 25th-ranked pass rush in dire need. Maybe 2025 first round pick Shemar Stewart will get there, but he was always a project whose growth was further stunted by a truly pointless contract standoff last season.\n\nBailey brings proven production that Stewart did not, racking up a Big 12-leading 19.5 tackles for loss and an FBS-leading 14.5 sacks after departing Stanford for a hefty payday at Texas Tech. His explosive get-off and devastating closing speed means he can man the second level, but at 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds he's not so small he can't handle edge duties in Ohio (Joseph Ossai, for example, only has an inch and about 15 pounds on him). He's not a perfect fit, but Cincinnati gets a chance to course correct by taking an NFL-ready pass rusher in the first round.\n\nIn theory, Miami's next coach could use this pick to pump up his offense with another athletic marvel and make tight end Kenyon Sadiq a Dolphin. But whomever succeeds Mike McDaniel badly needs to address the league's 25th-ranked defense. And, lo and behold, Miami has a need at safety and Downs has slid out of the top 10.\n\nDowns can play deep or near the line of scrimmage and line up tracking slot receivers with ease. His NFL ceiling is \"Brian Branch, but better.\" He's a fixer, plain and simple, in a Miami defense in need of playmakers.\n\nDoes Jerry Jones truly want to shore up his run defense? If so, Clemson's Peter Woods could be the call here. Is he in the market for a Trevon Diggs replacement? There's Mansoor Delane and Jermod McCoy, among others. But the combination of need and cost savings at a high cost position instead shift the focus to Faulk, a high potential pass rusher who could lift a team that went from a top-four pressure rate with Micah Parsons in the lineup to the middle of the NFL pack without him.\n\nFaulk brings proven production (seven sacks in 2024 before this fall's down year) and the size Cincinnati covets up front (6-foot-6, 285 pounds). He's not a one-dimensional edge rusher, either; he has legitimate chops on the ground for a defense that ranked 29th in rushing EPA allowed in 2025.\n\nThe Rams only have three pending free agents who played more than 50 percent of the teams snaps on offense or defense. All three are defensive backs, including Cobie Durant. Darious Williams is 32 years old. 2026 presents a wonderful opportunity for LA to take the draft's first cornerback.\n\nEnter Delane, who led the SEC with 11 pass breakups and hauled in a pair of interceptions in 11 games. He can be trusted in single coverage on the sideline, with fluid hips and turn-and-go speed to keep up with NFL deep threats. His trustworthiness on an island could mean more blitzes for the Rams -- and an even scarier defense.\n\nThis is a pick that may hinge on Baltimore's next head coach. But this is a franchise with a definite identity. Landing a hoss like Woods who can set a bruising tone up front would help the Ravens get back to it.\n\nWoods, a 315-pound fairy tale monster with absurd quickness and athleticism, is set to jump up draft boards at the 2026 Scouting Combine. He lands in the top half of the draft here, pairing with Justin Madubuike to give Baltimore some world-class BEEF in the middle of its line and make life easier for the defenders behind them.\n\nLavonte David cannot possibly keep doing this forever. Please welcome his replacement, a taller, faster version of Lavonte David.\n\nStyles is a former safety who plays like it (complimentary), using elite athleticism to create problems at every level. He has the speed to turn and run with slot receivers and the physicality to meet a running back at the line of scrimmage and leave him with nothing but regret.\n\nWith Moore on board, several options to punch up his receiving corps persist. But while solid wideouts will last into Day 2, there may only be one chance to draft 2026's top tight end. With apologies to Denzel Boston and Makai Lemon, Sadiq is the pick.\n\nThe Oregon tight end is an athletic marvel and solid blocker who can seal off running lanes or get out in space to deflect defensive backs. More importantly, he's got excellent speed up the seam and quick change-of-direction skills to snap off linebackers and slot corners. Pair that with solid hands and, baby, you've got a stew going.\n\nDetroit needs a pass rusher big enough to hold down the edge and the intelligence to react and adjust as plays unfold. The 6-foot-3, 265 pound Parker qualifies as a valuable counterweight to Aidan Hutchinson.\n\nThough his numbers tailed off after last year's absurd 19.5-TFL, 11-sack campaign, he remains a versatile piece with a high ceiling and useful floor. He's violent at the point of attack, using a quick punch and active hands to shed blockers, though he's fast enough to win with speed on the edge as well.\n\nByron Murphy and Isaiah Rodgers played well in 2025, but there's no such thing as too many talented quarterbacks in a defense as aggressive as Brian Flores'. Adding McCoy would create space to shift Rodgers to the slot, adding strength over the middle alongside a young player who can be trusted on the boundary.\n\nMcCoy's torn ACL kept him from shining in 2025, but his four-interception 2024 proved he's a shadow in coverage, rarely allowing space thanks to fluid hips, elite quickness and vital recognition skills. He's an asset in man coverage from the line of scrimmage, and erasing quick-outs is a specialty -- something that would be a boon for the Vikings' pressure in the pocket.\n\nThe Panthers are running out of time to decide whether Bryce Young can be their franchise quarterback. After Tetairoa McMillan and Jalen Coker made up 81 percent of their receiving output in a Wild Card loss to the Rams, it's clear Carolina could use help to maximize its young passer.\n\nLemon's size at 5-foot-10 is a concern, but putting him in a lineup across from 6-foot-4 McMillan and 6-foot-3 Coker alleviates that. More importantly, he gives the team another man coverage beater with elite acceleration and quickness who can thrive in the short/intermediate zone in the space McMillan creates.\n\nOhio State's Kayden McDonald could be an answer up front with Kenny Clark on the wrong side of 30. But cornerback is a more pressing need and a top-three prospect has slid into Dallas' range.\n\nNot a single defensive back in the Cowboys locker room finished 2025 with a passer rating under 99 when targeted. Terrell, with 22 breakups the last two seasons (and eight! forced! fumbles!) would be rain to that desert. With elite acceleration and lateral movement, he's difficult to shake -- even if he's a bit smaller than Jerry Jones might prefer at under six feet tall.\n\nSure, a quarterback would be nice here -- but Ty Simpson here feels destined to end up like Kenny Pickett before him. It could be a wideout, but with Lemon off the board Pittsburgh may opt to play into tradition and coach up a receiver selected on Day 2 instead. Thus, we get Banks, a massive lineman who can play multiple roles but, most importantly, can succeed Cameron Heyward and pair with Derrick Harmon and Keeanu Benton to give the Steelers' a terrifying young defensive front.\n\nBanks has to refine his game, but his raw talent would make him a tantalizing lump of clay for a franchise that's expertly molded defensive talent. He's explosive at the snap and elusive laterally, allowing him to shed blocks and contribute all three downs. While injury limited him to three games this season and dented his draft stock, he may be due for a pre-draft rise this spring.\n\nZion Johnson has been frustrating in his time as a Charger and headed to free agency. Jim Harbaugh can pluck a Big Ten star to replace him months after the Patriots ended his season by brutalizing poor Justin Herbert.\n\nIoane, Iowa's Gennings Dunker or Oregon's Emmanuel Pregnon could be the call here, but let's start with the Nittany Lion. He's a brick wall at 330 pounds and has the quickness and aggression to create space at the second level -- something Jim Harbaugh will absolutely love as he establishes the run.\n\nThe Eagles haven't been shy about taking a legendary offensive lineman's replacement early in the draft while he's still on the roster. Cam Jurgens was drafted in 2022 to take over for Jason Kelce. Now comes Lomu ahead of whatever Lane Johnson decides comes next.\n\nPhiladelphia's pressure rate allowed actually decreased between 2024 and 2025, but all was not well across an offensive front whose struggles tied into an overall regression this fall. Lomu is a high level athlete who adjusted to Big 12 play with aplomb, showcasing All-Pro upside for the right head coach. Given the Eagles' success with homegrown and retread blockers in the past, his upside is too much to pass up.\n\nWith a blocking upgrade secured in the top 10, the Browns take the next step to elevate whichever poor, unfortunate soul has to play quarterback next season. It's too early to write off Jerry Jeudy even after his disastrous 2025. Instead, he gets a little help -- and another big body alongside Harold Fannin Jr. to serve as a playmaking threat.\n\nThe 6-foot-4 Boston is a bail out machine on jump balls, but his biggest strength comes breaking off defenders in the mid-range. That would make him kind of a super-sized Kayshon Boutte. We've seen how nicely Drake Maye has leaned on Boutte en route to an All-Pro second season, correct?\n\nThe draft board has been kind to the Bears -- even at No. 25 they have a wide array of top-level prospects to choose from at positions of need. Secondary and offensive line help is waiting, but Howell's value for the league's 27th-ranked pass rush is massive.\n\nHowell led the SEC with 11 sacks. While he doesn't have an enormous frame at 6-foot-2 and 250 pounds, his versatile pass rushing attack makes him an asset even in Chicago's 4-3 alignment. His ability to use his speed to create leverage and then toss off blockers suggests he could help fix what ails the Bears.\n\nBuffalo could fall in love with a wideout here, but there will be time to address the position on Day 2. Finding a young stud who can keep the middle of the line chugging forward with both Connor McGovern and David Edwards headed to free agency, however, is a tougher call. Dunker could step in immediately to pair with O'Cyrus Torrence as a road-grading young duo at guard.\n\nThe Iowa tackle will likely kick inside due to his arm length but can hold his own on the edge if needed. More importantly, he's mean as hell, quick at the point of attack and difficult to move backward. So, pretty standard Hawkeye stuff.\n\nTrent Williams has to retire someday. We saw how lost the Niners looked without him in stretches in 2025. The Niners' postseason success has prevented them from at least a couple potential saviors earlier in round one, but they still get a good one here. Proctor is enormous; 6-foot-7 and more than 360 pounds.\n\nHe's got the strength to match that frame, but his athleticism belongs to a much smaller man -- including a 32-inch vertical leap despite being the same weight as a Smart car. He's solid as a shadow, and while pad level and lateral quickness will always be a concern with a player his size he should make an immediate impact if Williams doesn't return for 2026.\n\nAh crap, we let the Texans get another elite defensive prospect. McDonald is an anchor up front, damn near impossible to move at 326 pounds. But he's also blessed with an explosive opening salvo that fires him into gaps and shrinks pocket space from the inside-out. Now he gets to pair up with Will Anderson and Danielle Hunter.\n\nCould this be a spot for Alabama's Ty Simpson to serve as Matthew Stafford's apprentice? It's possible, but Allen's availability and the need to add dynamic, young athletic talent to the middle of the field makes the Georgia linebacker the pick.\n\nAllen can handle pass rushing duties as well as lock down the middle of the field in coverage or against the run. He's not huge at 6-foot-1 and 235 pounds, but he moves quickly and fluidity, rarely crossing himself up and sticking to receivers in coverage. He's also a bonafide thumper who can move Omar Speights into pending free agent Troy Reeder's role as a rotational presence.\n\nNew England's pass rush was a strength in its Wild Card win over the Chargers, but K'Lavon Chaisson is a free agent and Harold Landry turns 30 this summer. Reloading here would help create positional savings that will be vital once Drake Maye signs a record-setting contract extension.\n\nUiagalelei can break into the lineup as a pass rushing specialist while fleshing out his game. He's an athletic marvel who looks the part of an NFL star but still needs to refine his game. But with power and speed in droves, he'd bring a stable floor to a position of need for Mike Vrabel.\n\nCisse's turn-and-run ability and elite acceleration suggest he's going to be an absolute darling at the combine. That raw athletic ability is backed by an inconsistent approach -- his 78.9 passer rating in Columbia last season was solid but his 20-plus yards allowed per reception were not. Fortunately, he lands here with a head coach capable of extracting the very best from him.\n\nCisse occasionally plays over-excited, biting on double-moves and adding some boom-bust to his game. Mike Macdonald can fix that. If he can, there's a player with All-Pro potential waiting underneath.\n\nAlex Singleton is a pending free agent on the wrong side of 30. Denver needs a running mate next to Dre Greenlaw in the middle of the field. Hill can do that.\n\nThe Texas star is a smart linebacker who identifies plays and gets where he needs to be to stop them. His coverage continues to develop, but that's a weakness that the rest of the Broncos' defense can help cover as he develops it into a strength.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: NFL mock draft: Can Jets, Browns double-dips save their franchises?",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M's 2026 offensive line will feature four new starters after four 2025 veterans will depart due to expired eligibility, combined with declaring for the 2026 NFL Draft. Just a week after the transfer portal opened, head coach Mike Elko and O-line coach Adam Cushing went to work, landing four likely replacements, including former Aggie commit and LSU sophomore guard Coen Echols.\n\nWhile this group looks all but finished, Monday's news that former Texas A&M recruiting target and Colorado sophomore tackle Jordan Seaton will enter the transfer portal likely has every Power 4 coaching staff scrambling to arrange a visit in the coming days, including Mike Elko.\n\nSeaton, a five-star prospect in the 2024 recruiting class, spent last season as Colorado's starting left tackle, appearing in nine games, allowing just two sacks and seven total pressures, earning a Pro Football Focus pass pro grade of 83.9, including prolific grades of 91 against Houston and 91.5 against TCU.\n\nOn his way to becoming a first-round pick in the 2028 or 2029 NFL Draft, wherever he chooses to play next should be based on his development track. Immediately after the announcement, On3's Pete Nakos revealed that sources have told him that Oregon and Texas, two teams in need of starting-level tackles, are the primary contenders this early in the process, but also stated that Ole Miss, Texas Tech, LSU, Miami, and Texas A&M are also in the mix.\n\nKnowing that his NIL value is anywhere between $1 million and $2 million.5 mllion, give or take, I can safely say that Elko will at least \"kick the tires\" on the elite left tackle, even though the staff seems content with what they currently have in the building.\n\nNEW: Colorado OL Jordan Seaton plans to enter the NCAA transfer portal, @PeteNakos reports. \n\nSeaton was as Five-Star Plus+ in the 2024 class.https://t.co/MvGJiwwtfH pic.twitter.com/D4juA1jU4b\n\n— On3 (@On3sports) January 13, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Texas A&M should be in the mix for Colorado transfer OL Jordan Seaton",

    "fullText": "Liverpool have taken steps of late to ensure continuity in the centre-back sector.\n\nYoung defenders - Giovanni Leoni, Mor Talla Ndiaye and Noah Adekoya - are among the arrivals this season as sporting director Richard Hughes plots a way forward.\n\nIbrahima Konate could LEAVE the club in summer if no new contract can be agreed. Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez meanwhile are both contracted until 2027 with neither expected to remain at Anfield beyond that time.\n\nAnd so that’s why transfer links with up-and-coming centre-backs make sense.\n\nWe’ve seen the likes of Joel Ordonez and Jeremy Jacquet linked in recent weeks ahead of potential deals in the January window or else in summer.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nAnd now it looks like the Premier League champions are going to get involved in a complex chase for one of the game’s fastest-rising defensive stars.\n\nJacobo Ramon, 20, has been a revelation since swapping Real Madrid for Como in a £2m deal in summer 2025. This season the Spaniard has taken HUGE strides for Cesc Fabregas’ side - emerging as one of the best defenders in Serie A.\n\nAs a result he has been linked with an onward move to either the Premier League or LaLiga - with Madrid currently holding all the cards in Ramon’s next deal.\n\nThe defender has got an €8m buyback clause inserted in his Como deal that applies to Madrid and right now it would be foolish for the Spanish capital club not to exercise it.\n\nEven if they don’t plan on using Ramon in their first team they could flip him for a far bigger profit. And even if Madrid decline their buyback clause they will still cash in on 50 percent of any deal that takes him out of Como.\n\nBut these details have not put Liverpool off - according to a report in Caught Offside.\n\n“Since December, Chelsea, Tottenham and Liverpool have been monitoring him closely, while Newcastle United, Brighton and Crystal Palace have also sent scouts to watch his performances firsthand,” a report reads.\n\n“Liverpool admire his pace and composure, traits that match perfectly with their high-intensity, press-oriented defensive structure.”\n\nRamon - a Spain under-21 international - signed a deal with Como until 2030 but is widely expected to leave before then. This season he has played 16 times in the Italian top flight for the Stadio Giuseppe Sinigaglia side - scoring twice.\n\nIt promises to be a massive transfer fight for one of the game’s rising stars - and we can take encouragement from the fact that Richard Hughes seems up for the battle.",

    "fullText": "Poland have clinched their first United Cup crown, edging out Switzerland 2-1 in Sunday’s final.\n\nWith Swiatek still searching for top form and Hurkacz carrying an ankle injury, it was a win that didn’t come easyly.\n\nIga Swiatek will have to turn her attention to fine-tuning her game for the 2026 Australian Open after two subpar showings over the weekend.\n\nThe Polish star struggled to impose herself across the tournament. She needed three sets to get past Germany’s Eva Lys and then suffered consecutive defeats against Coco Gauff and Belinda Bencic.\n\nBencic handed Swiatek a 3-6, 6-0, 6-3 loss in the final on Sunday after Gauff had beaten her comfortably in straight sets during the semi-finals.\n\n“It’s not the fact of her [Swiatek] losing to Bencic and Gauff playing out of their minds.” Catherine Whitaker said on The Tennis Podcast.\n\n“It’s the pattern of these defeats. I think, and it’s a continuation of a pattern that we saw last year, and we were wary about being too alarmist about the defeats that seemed to… these matches that seemed to get away from Swiatek and crumble before her and our eyes, because she won Wimbledon last year.\n\nWhitaker went on to explain what exactly bothers her most about how Swiatek handles those situations, highlighting a specific part of her game that is also linked to previous poor losses.\n\n“As we discussed in all of our various review shows, we think she would have signed for last season at the start of it.\n\n“It was a good season for Iga Swiatek, and yet there was this slightly dark underbelly of defeats that looked like this, where once the match got away from her, once her opponent gets her teeth into the match, she starts malfunctioning, and appears to resort to the default of hitting harder and taking more and more risk; the opposite of what we understand that her project is with Wim Fissette.\n\n“And it’s becoming pretty maddening to watch because it’s the definition of madness: doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome is the proverbial definition of madness. Yet it feels like this is what we’re watching in these types of matches.”\n\nMatt Roberts picked up from there: “It is a problem. And you use that word – ‘pattern.’ Now it feels like when Swiatek goes up against fellow top players. More often than not at the moment, she’s not winning those matches.”\n\n“And she always used to have dominant records over fellow top players but that is something that has really changed in the last year or so.”\n\n“And I think it’s because these players are good enough now to push her into stressful situations where she seems caught between playing styles.”\n\nGauff, the world number four, beat Swiatek 6-4, 6-2 in Sydney, and Whitaker felt it showed a lot about the difference between them at the moment.\n\nShe said: “The Gauff match up I feel particularly sheds a light on the problem with Iga Swiatek, because Gauff is loose in that matchup in a way she doesn’t seem to be a lot… a lot of her serving and forehand issues do seem to kind of miraculously evaporate when she’s on the court with Swiatek now.\n\n“And Gauff knows if she can hang in the rallies long enough, Swiatek will make a mistake; and nobody hangs in a rally better than Coco Gauff. She makes balls nobody else can make. I reckon she makes 25 per cent more balls than pretty much anybody else in the WTA; it’s that ridiculous.\n\n“And yeah she’s like ‘okay, I’ll rest on my positives and you’re going to cough up enough errors for me to do this thing and I’m comfortable in that dynamic.’ It’s slightly alarming to watch.”",

    "description": "The Houston Texans' defense dominated the Pittsburgh Steelers, but C.J. Stroud's sloppiness (three turnovers) was cause for concern.",
    "fullText": "PITTSBURGH — Stating the obvious here, the Houston Texans’ defense is championship caliber – to the point they may carry the entire roster to northern California themselves within the next month.\n\nThat also means the pressure is on quarterback C.J. Stroud and the other side of the ball, because not supporting what has developed into one of the most simultaneously suffocating and crushing units in recent memory would be to waste a potentially deep postseason run in a weaker AFC field.\n\nDeMeco Ryans’ unit scored twice in Houston’s 30-6 rout of the Pittsburgh Steelers in the wild-card round Monday, Jan. 13, at Acrisure Stadium. The concerning part is that Stroud’s carelessness with the football, which resulted in two fumbles lost (five fumbles total and several issues with the snap) and a red-zone interception, kept the Steelers in the game for more than three quarters despite the Texans’ defense ultimately surrendering the fewest points and yards in team postseason history.\n\n\"Bad plays happen, turnovers happen in a game,\" Ryans said. \"We bounced back and didn’t let that affect us the rest of the game.\"\n\nThe defense was credited with 12 hits against Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, whom they sacked four times.\n\nRyans liked that the offense finished the game strong regardless of prior mistakes. Stroud still displayed his flashes of greatness. There was the first third-down throw of the game to Christian Kirk for 36 yards and a third-and-15 completion to Kirk for 46 yards on the final play of the third quarter, which flipped the field and led to a Ka'imi Fairbairn field goal that made it 10-6.\n\n\"He didn’t waver,\" Ryans said of Stroud. \"You can easily go in the tank, but he didn’t waver. That’s who he is. He is a resilient young man who’s able to bounce back. Anybody can go in the tank (after) you drop the ball a few times. You keep battling. Like, the game isn’t over.\"\n\nIn Ryans’ third season (and Stroud’s), the Texans are 3-0 in wild-card games. They are the second head coach-quarterback duo since 1950 to make it to the divisional round in each of their first three seasons in the NFL. They will try to avoid going 0-3 in that round Sunday on the road against the New England Patriots (3 p.m. ET, ESPN/ABC).\n\n\"It was an outstanding defensive performance, one of the best that I’ve seen versus a really talented offense, talented quarterback who has played at a high level for a long time,\" Ryans said of facing Rodgers. \"So, I’m proud of our defensive performance. I think this is the best performance we’ve had in our team history, so I’m proud of our guys for that.\"\n\nThe dam eventually broke with less than 12 minutes in the fourth quarter when Rodgers dropped back and Will Anderson Jr. curled around the edge to his blind side. The 2023 No. 3 overall pick dislodged the pigskin while demolishing Rodgers, and Sheldon Rankins picked it up and ran 33 yards for a touchdown to make it 17-6. Calen Bullock intercepted Rodgers with the game already out of reach but housed it 50 yards to make it 30-6.\n\n\"I think our defense has played like this all year,\" Stroud said. \"They've held us up. I think this is one of the best performances I've ever seen. It's crazy to think the last three wild-card games I've played in they've always had a pick six and some type of two-turnover game. When you have a defense like that it's really, really encouraging.\"\n\nThe offensive line, a sore spot for the past two seasons that has clouded Stroud’s development, held up against a Steelers’ front that could have been more disruptive. Instead, the blockers gave Stroud plenty of time and were difference-makers in the run game. Rookie Woody Marks went for a season-high 112 rushing yards on 19 attempts, while Nick Chubb ran hard for 48 yards on 10 carries. Stroud completed 21 of 32 passes for 250 passing yards, and six different receivers caught at least two passes, with Kirk leading the way (8 catches, 144 yards, 1 touchdown). Nico Collins’ concussion will be something to monitor leading into the matchup against New England.\n\nThe line was instrumental in sustaining two lengthy touchdown drives. The first was a 14-play, 92-yard sequence in which the Texans rushed seven times for 55 yards and took 7:01 off the clock. Marks’ 13-yard touchdown with 3:43 left in the fourth capped a five-minute, 51-second possession. Stroud’s efficiency on third down – the Texans started the game 7-for-9 – was another positive. Stroud said every teammate has a high standard of accountability.\n\n\"It's not just on C.J., not just on me,\" Stroud said. \"I've been on teams like that, where there is a lot of the pressure (on me). Everybody is, ‘I could have done this better,’ I could have done that better.’ I think it does start with me. I got to take care of the football. Other than that, I thought I played a good game.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: C.J. Stroud must play cleaner for sake of Texans' dominant defense",

    "fullText": "Not that things were going well, but European football was caught by surprise with the recent dismissal of Xabi Alonso from his position as Real Madrid’s head coach.\n\nAmid rumors that Jürgen Klopp was the main candidate to take over at the Santiago Bernabéu club, the German coach decided to speak out clearly on the German television channel Servus TV, ruling out any possibility of taking the job in the Spanish capital.\n\nKlopp was categorical when asked about Real Madrid’s interest in his services. \"That has nothing to do with me and it hasn’t affected me at all,\" said the former Liverpool manager, making it clear that his current priority is far from coaching in the elite of English football.\n\nFor the German, his departure remains non-negotiable, despite the prestige of Real Madrid’s offer.\n\nDuring the interview, Jürgen analyzed the current state of professional football and his personal position.\n\n\"The coaching market is going through a major transformation, and there’s nothing wrong with watching everything from the outside and not thinking about what it could mean for you,\" he explained.\n\nThe coach also had words of support for Xabi Alonso, whose departure from Real Madrid surprised many. According to Klopp, the coach’s failure is \"a sign that not everything there is 100% right.\"\n\nHe described Xabi as an exceptionally talented coach who struggled as the successor to a legend like Carlo Ancelotti, who had a very particular and difficult-to-replicate management style.\n\nFinally, Klopp emphasized his respect for the work done by his Spanish colleague, sending a message of support after his dismissal. \"I feel sorry for him, because I think he’s a great coach,\" he concluded.\n\nOn the morning of this Tuesday (13th), Álvaro Arbeloa led his first training session as Real Madrid’s head coach.\n\nThe 42-year-old Spaniard, who will also give a press conference this Tuesday, signed until the end of the season, with the possibility of renewal, according to Spanish media reports.\n\nBefore replacing Xabi, the former full-back, a multi-champion with the Merengues, was in charge of Real Madrid Castilla, the club’s B team.\n\nHis first match in charge of the main team will be on Wednesday at 5 p.m. against Albacete, in the Copa del Rey.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

That trip ended with Sunday night's loss to the Patriots and Mack is back to contemplating his football future for the second straight year.\n\nOn Monday, Mack said that he will \"make a decision based on how I'm feeling and how my family is feeling, the vibes\" and that he isn't going to rush that call.\n\n\"You feel different in the sense of understanding how much time do you really have left to play at a certain level and what is that going to look like moving forward,\" Mack said, via the team's website. \"You don't want to make a decision based on how you feel in the present moment, especially after a tough loss. It's about taking time and taking that step back. I feel like it's the same in that sense, taking a step back and trying to really not put too much emotion behind the decision to do whatever it is I'm going to do.\"\n\nIn addition to his pass rush ability, Mack was a key part of the run defense for the Chargers and his departure would leave a big hole for the team to fill heading into next season.",

    "fullText": "Liam Rosenior’s calm presence in front of the media has already made an impression. He carries himself well, and it is unlikely that Todd Boehly will be worrying about a repeat of any Enzo Maresca-style outbursts.\n\nSince taking charge, Rosenior has spoken to the press several times, first after his appointment, then before facing Charlton, and again following Saturday’s 5-1 victory.\n\nThe early signs are encouraging. Some questioned whether the step up to Stamford Bridge would be too much for him, but he has started to put those doubts to rest with a composed start.\n\nRosenior’s measured way of handling media duties comes at a good time for Chelsea. After Maresca publicly criticised the board – and with similar issues happening at Manchester United under Ruben Amorim – his steady approach provides some welcome stability.\n\nWhile Rosenior presents a composed figure in front of the media, reports from inside Chelsea suggest a different side to his management. There are already signs of increased intensity in training, something that was said to be lacking during Maresca’s time in charge.\n\nEven with some of the criticism directed at Maresca after his departure, it should not be forgotten that he did bring some silverware to the club, including the Europa Conference League and the Club World Cup earlier in the summer.\n\nRosenior has not ignored those achievements either. Speaking after Saturday’s match, he spoke about Maresca and acknowledged that he has taken over a squad that has already had good coaching.\n\n“This team won the Club World Cup five months ago. This is a team that won the Conference League last year. We’re a good team. We are a good team. They’ve been well coached. I’ve made no secret of that.”\n\nThroughout his time at Chelsea, it often seemed like Maresca was in constant disagreement with those above him, regularly pushing back against decisions not only from ownership but across various parts of the club’s hierarchy.\n\nWith Liam Rosenior now in charge, there are expectations within the club that things will change. The board believes he will look to control matches through possession-based football and also take medical advice more seriously – something they felt was lacking under Maresca.\n\nThe early signs have been positive for Rosenior, but tougher challenges are just around the corner. Chelsea’s next test is against Arsenal in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final before facing Brentford in league action.",

    "description": "Notre Dame “won” a transfer recruiting battle, as they convinced defensive lineman Armel Mukam to withdraw from the portal.",
    "fullText": "Sometimes the grass isn’t greener on the other side, and for one Notre Dame defender, after testing the waters of the transfer portal, he decided that South Bend was still the place for him.\n\nDefensive lineman Armel Mukam, who entered the transfer portal on at the beginning of the year, took a few visits to Georgia Tech and Virginia. It looked like he was on his way out, but on Sunday, Mike Singer reported that he has withdrawn his name from the transfer portal and will continue his career with the Blue and Gold.\n\nWhile Mukam is a “returning” player, anytime you have a former 4-star prospect look around and realize that there aren’t really other schools like Notre Dame, it’s a big time win. There have been more than a few players doing the same this cycle, as this is the first for the Irish.\n\nThe statistics don’t jump off the charts for Mukam, but he knows the defense well, and is a great coming off the bench to rest some of his teammates. Depth is huge now with a potentially long season, and Mukam returns with plenty of that.\n\n𝗕𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗞𝗜𝗡𝗚: Notre Dame DL Armel Mukam is returning to the Fighting Irish from the NCAA Transfer Portal, sources tell @EHansenND and me ‼️☘️\n\nHe visited Georgia Tech and Virginia, but he's back at Notre Dame. 🫡\n\nStory: https://t.co/uxCizORXmg pic.twitter.com/FJ1SDZBhEx\n\n— Mike Singer (@MikeTSinger) January 11, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: Notre Dame lineman withdraws from the portal, will stay with the Irish",

    "description": "MLB gives the A-OK for replacement players",
    "fullText": "1922 \nBlack Sox member Buck Weaver petitioned for reinstatement into baseball. The former White Sox third baseman was one of eight players banned for life due to his involvement in throwing the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nThough Weaver was the most innocent of the Black Sox, he did attend at least two meetings in which the specifics of throwing the Series were discussed. It went uncontested that Weaver took no money from gamblers and played at his full potential for the entire Series.\n\nHowever, Judge Landis did not yield, turning down Weaver’s application.\n\n1927 \nTo make room for the up-and-coming Tony Lazzeri, the Yankees sent second baseman Aaron Ward to Chicago for catcher Johnny Grabowski and second baseman Ray Moreheart.\n\nWhile Ward played just one year for the White Sox — at 30, his final full year in the bigs — the South Siders got the better end of this deal. Ward put up a .270/.360/.391 as a regular, good for a 96 OPS+ and 2.1 WAR. Moreheart played in 73 games with a .681 OPS and 0.7 WAR, while Grabowski would have a -1.1 WAR in 167 games over the next three years in the Bronx.\n\nOn the other hand, Grabowski and Moreheart both got to play on one of the best teams in MLB history, the Murderer’s Row Yankees who went 110-44-1 and swept the Pirates in the 1927 World Series.\n\n1991 \nIt’s not often you’ll see an NFL item in our daily history, but this one has resonance.\n\nIn a playoff game for the Oakland Raiders vs. the Cincinnati Bengals, running back Bo Jackson suffered a season-ending, and career-threatening, leg injury. Initially said to be a pulled thigh muscle, Jackson’s setback is much more significant, necessitating surgery — and eventually, a hip replacement.\n\nWhen Bo’s baseball club at the time (he was a two-sport player), the Kansas City Royals, learned of the severity of his injury, he was released. Two weeks later, the White Sox snatched him up, believing in Jackson’s determination to rehab his injury and stage a baseball comeback. The outfielder sat out the entire 1992 season before making his return to the field — with an artificial hip — on April 9, 1993.\n\nHis first at-bat resulted in a pinch-hit home run.\n\n1995 \nBaseball’s executive council voted to allow replacement players in upcoming Spring Training and regular season games, given the ongoing labor impasse with the MLBPA. The more prominent scabs who briefly would become White Sox were shortstop Kent Anderson, outfielder Shawn Buchanan, starting pitcher Oil Can Boyd, outfielder Al Chambers, reliever John Davis, catcher Bill Lindsey, catcher Junior Ortiz and third baseman Pete Rose Jr.\n\nRecall that this is the decision that would eventually drive aspiring major-leaguer Michael Jordan from his baseball career.\n\n2020 \nPunishments were handed down to the Astros as a result of their trash can scandal, which allowed Houston to cheat its way to a World Series title in 2017. While NO players were punished, GM Jeff Luhnow and manager A.J. Hinch were suspended for a season (and subsequently fired by the Astros). Houston also had to pay a $5 million fine and lose its twp two picks in the 2020 and 2021 drafts.\n\nWhy is this a White Sox item? Because Chicago reliever Danny Farquhar, during a September 2017 game in Houston, heard the trash can and unearthed the scandal, calling catcher Kevan Smith out to change the signs and foil the plot. The story didn’t break because no one picked up on what happened; Farquhar admitted later that he was sitting at his locker postgame just waiting to tell his story … but no one asked.",

    "fullText": "There’s no need to buy new – unless your model’s ready for retirement. Our technology expert compares the top Apple smartwatches available right now\n\nThe best running watches – tested\n\nThe best Apple Watch may be the one already on your wrist.\n\nEach generation of Apple’s smartwatch is fairly iterative, with most of the best features added via software updates, which means there’s no need to buy a new device each year. That said, if your watch has seen better days, or it’s stopped receiving updates, then your best options are set out below.\n\nWhile several third-party smartwatches are compatible with the iPhone, they don’t offer the same level of integration that the Apple Watch does with the phone, iOS and the company’s other devices and services. It’s the best smartwatch for iPhone users, but note that you’ll need an iPhone running iOS 26 – iPhone 11 or later – to use one. The Apple Watch can’t be used with Android or as a standalone device.\n\nBest Apple Watch for most people:\nSE 3\n\nBest mid-range Apple Watch: \n\n Series 11\n\nBest Apple Watch for battery: \n\n Ultra 3\n\nI have been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert. In that time, I’ve seen all manner of tech fads come and go, smartphone giants rise and fall, the cutting-edge morph into the mainstream, and have poked, prodded and evaluated more than 1,000 devices – sometimes to destruction.\n\nWe conduct real-world testing of smartwatches and their various features to ensure they meet expectations and compare to their rivals.\n\nWe change the straps, poke, prod and twiddle every button, dial and setting. We wear the smartwatches day and night, seeing how they feel on the wrist, how well they fit under and with clothes, whether they catch on objects in daily life, and how well they stay put during vigorous exercise.\n\nWe test their health metrics, track various activities, and compare them for accuracy. We do everything a typical smartwatch user would, picking up notifications, installing apps, sending messages, making calls, exercising, listening to music, monitoring our health and tracking our sleep. We see how long the battery lasts in general use and while exercising, whether it’s consistent and reliable, plus how long it takes to charge.\n\nThe recently updated entry-level Apple Watch SE 3 offers almost everything its more expensive siblings do, but at a discount.\n\nIt’s light and comfortable to wear, and arrives in a choice of 40mm and 44mm case sizes. Available in either starlight or midnight aluminium, with many different strap colours and types, it should fit most wrists and styles.\n\nThe big upgrade for the SE this year is the always-on display, as well as the rapid S10 chip and 64GB of storage from the Series 11. It runs the latest watchOS 26, which comes with super-handy double-tap and wrist-flick gestures to clear notifications, alarms and scroll through your widgets hands-free. Siri runs locally, so you can quickly set timers, dictate messages and other basic features without an internet connection. And the SE 3 has all the deep integration with the iPhone that makes Apple Watches great, including Apple Pay, notifications, calls, texts, maps, photos, music control and many other features. Battery life is about one and a half days.\n\nThe SE 3 sports an older design than the current Series watch line, with chunkier bezels, a slightly smaller and dimmer screen and a 1mm thicker body, but otherwise it looks very similar to all other Apple Watches. Only those comparing them side by side are likely to spot the difference.\n\nWhile you get most of Apple’s class-leading health-tracking features, this entry-level model can’t take ECGs of your heart, record blood oxygen saturation or notify you about any potential hypertension. It still has an optical heart-rate monitor for recording throughout the day and night, though. Its skin temperature sensor allows for retrospective ovulation estimates in the cycles tracking app, too, alongside other features.\n\nIt tracks all your usual sleep, standing, steps and movement goals, and the GPS makes it a decent running and workout tracker. It supports Apple’s new AI Workout Buddy coach, but this requires an iPhone 15 Pro or later with Apple Intelligence to be carried with you on runs.\n\nNote that 5G models are available, but require a plan linked to your phone provider. And if you’re looking for a cellular-connected watch, I’d recommend the Series 11 with 5G instead.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe SE 3 offers all the essential bits of the Apple Watch experience, including an always-on screen, but in an older-looking body with a few more advanced health features removed. That leaves a great smartwatch for iPhone users that does most of what people want at a good price.\n\nDon’t buy if: you want ECG or hypertension alerts.\n\nRead our full Apple Watch SE 3 review: the bargain smartwatch for iPhone\n\nSize: 40/44mm\nThickness: 10.7mm\nScreen brightness: up to 1,000nits\nTested battery life: 1.5 days\nProcessor: S10\nStorage: 64GB\nWater resistance: 50 metres \nSensors: HR (2nd gen), skin temperature, GPS\n\nThe biggest, boldest and longest-lasting Apple Watch is the Ultra 3, which builds on the Series 11 with a supersized screen and body, and adds a bunch of adventure-ready features – ready for life in the wilderness, or just work in the city.\n\nIt’s available only in titanium and at 49mm, although there’s a choice of a natural or black finish. It has the biggest and brightest screen on an Apple Watch, protected by scratch-resistant sapphire crystal. Similar to the Series 11, the display is much brighter off-angle, making it easier to read at a glance.\n\nOn the inside, it’s similar to the Series 11: an S10 chip, 64GB storage, and 5G support as standard with a compatible phone plan. It runs the same watchOS 26, including the double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, but battery life is three days plus with general use. This will see you through a long weekend, or up to 14 hours of tracking workouts at the highest accuracy settings.\n\nOn the outside, the Ultra 3 has an extra action button, with which you can start a workout and light up the screen as a torch, plus other features. There’s a chunkier crown and a loudspeaker that doubles as a siren to attract attention in emergency situations. New for this year is satellite connectivity for free SOS messaging to the emergency services, if things go awry when you’re out of cellular signal range.\n\nThe Ultra 3 also has dual-band GPS, making it one of the most accurate running, cycling and sports tracking watches available. It offers a good suite of tracking metrics, plus Workout Buddy for motivation, if you carry your iPhone with you. The watch can also track dives to 40 metres’ depth and at least 22 other activities.\n\nSize-wise, it’s big for an Apple Watch – but the Ultra 3 still fits under shirt cuffs, and is relatively compact compared with adventure watch rivals from the likes of Garmin. This is a good choice should you want an Apple Watch that stands out – although it costs about twice as much as the Series 11.\n\nWhy should you buy it?\nThe Ultra 3 is the biggest, boldest, longest-lasting, and most capable Apple Watch. It’s ready for daily life, workouts or the odd adventure into the wilderness.\n\nDon’t buy if: you need a compact model or have smaller wrists.\n\nRead our full Apple Watch Ultra 3 review: the biggest and best smartwatch for an iPhone\n\nSize: 49mm\nThickness: 12mm \nScreen brightness: up to 3,000nits\nTested battery life: 3 days\nProcessor: S10\nStorage: 64GB\nWater resistance: 100 metres \nSensors: HR (3rd gen), ECG, spO2, skin/water temp, depth, dual-band GPS\n\nSeries 10 \n\n The same design as the Series 11 with the same chip and screen, but with a slightly smaller battery, less scratch-resistant glass and 4G rather than 5G. Worth buying at a discount.\n\nSeries 9 \n\n Thicker and with a slightly smaller screen than the Series 10 or 11, but worth buying refurbished if you don’t want the SE 3.\n\nUltra 2 \n\n 2023’s Ultra Apple Watch was great, and is only missing a few small upgrades to screen, battery, 5G and satellite SOS compared with the current model.\n\nWearable devices can take a beating, so if your existing Apple Watch is looking a bit tired, there are things you can do. Simply cleaning out the speaker grilles and other crevices can help, as can swapping out the straps or switching up the face to make the watch look fresh.\n\nGreater damage, such as a cracked screen, can be repaired, although options are more limited than those for an iPhone. Apple charges at least £169 for such repairs; third parties can be cheaper. Having Apple replace batteries costs £95.\n\nBuying refurbished watches is a good option for the planet and your wallet. Apple’s are among the fastest and smoothest-running smartwatches available, and they are supported by software updates for about six years from release, so buying a refurbished model can save you some money.\n\nThere are two types of refurbished Apple Watch available: those that Apple refurbishes and sells as new directly, and those refurbished by third parties that are available in various grades or conditions for less.\n\nSeveral third-party retailers offer secondhand or refurbished Apple Watches, including the UK high-street chain CeX, online stores such as musicMagpie, and marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay and Back Market.\n\nMake sure you consider the condition of the watch before parting with any cash. Grading is as follows:\n\nGrade A or excellent – virtually identical to new, often with the original box and accessories, making them the most expensive.\n\nGrade B or good – in full working order but with light marks, and it may come with replacement accessories.\n\nGrade C or fair – in full working order but with obvious signs of use, and it may not come with accessories.\n\nOnce you’re satisfied with a watch’s condition, ensure you check that the strap connects properly and that the device powers up and connects to your iPhone. Then check the following:\n\nBattery health – the battery in the Apple Watch is designed to maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 1,000 full charge cycles. Check the battery health under battery via the Settings app on the watch. Has the battery been replaced?\n\nCharging cable – the Apple Watch requires a special magnetic puck, which costs £29 on its own, to charge. Make sure an authentic, USB-C puck is included and snaps into place correctly on the back of the watch.\n\nButtons – check the buttons and digital crown are in good working order and don’t need to be pressed too hard to function.\n\nSensors – the back of the Apple Watch contains a cluster of delicate sensors. Ensure they work correctly – can you see the LEDs of the heart-rate sensor light up?\n\nSpeakers – check the speakers are free of dirt and fluff, and function correctly for Siri, alarms and calls.\n\nWifi – the Apple Watch shares wifi details with the iPhone, so fully turn off Bluetooth on your iPhone in the Settings app when in range of your home wifi to check the watch can connect properly.\n\nWater resistance – the watch needs to be properly sealed to maintain its water resistance. Has it been obviously opened, and does the refurbisher maintain the original 50-metre water resistance?\n\nWarranty – what kind of warranty and support does the refurbisher offer?\n\nAny Apple Watch Series 7 or older, as you simply won’t benefit from the software support for long before you’ll have to replace the device.\n\nFor more:\n\n The best running watches – tested\n\n The best fitness tech and gadgets, according to experts\n\nSamuel Gibbs is the Guardian’s consumer technology editor",

    "description": "The pandemic gave workers increased options as home offices became the norm in some fields. Now, with the EU experiencing industrial slowdown and AI automation, workers are growing increasingly wary of switching jobs.",
    "fullText": "For a short time during the panndemic, workers across Europe enjoyed rare leverage over their employers. Generous furlough and reduced working-hour programs such as Germany's Kurzarbeit helped companies offset staffing costs. Offices became optional thanks to remote work.\n\nHeadlines about the so-called Great Resignation reflected a global labor shortage that sharply increased demand for talent. Workplace burnout gave rise to another new phrase, \"quiet quitting,\" as employees rejected overdelivering in pursuit of a healthier work-life balance.\n\nResearch by McKinsey, a New York-based consulting firm, in 2022 found that a third of European workers were considering quitting their jobs within three to six months, which Angelika Reich, leadership adviser at the executive recruitment firm Spencer Stuart, told DW was a \"striking figure for a region with a traditionally low [staff] turnover.\"\n\nWith the continent's industrial sector now under pressure, wage growth slowing and the threat of artificial intelligence (AI) replacing human work, that moment has quickly passed.\n\nReich noted how Europe's labor market has \"cooled down\" and how \"fewer job vacancies and a tougher economic climate naturally make employees more cautious about switching jobs.\"\n\nDespite remaining resilient, the 21-member eurozone's labor market is projected to grow more slowly this year, at 0.6% compared with 0.7% in 2025, according to the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\nAlthough that drop seems tiny, each 0.1 percentage point difference amounts to about 163,000 fewer new jobs being created. Just three years ago, the eurozone created some 2.76 million new jobs while growing at a robust rate of 1.7%.\n\nMigration has also played a major role in shaping Europe's labor supply, helping to ease acute worker shortages and support job growth in many countries. However, net migration is now stabilizing or falling.\n\nIn Germany, more than one in three companies plans to cut jobs this year, according to the Cologne-based IW economic think tank.\n\nThe Bank of France expects French unemployment to climb to 7.8%, while in the UK, two-thirds of economists questioned by The Times newspaper think unemployment could rise to as high as 5.5% from the current 5.1%.\n\nUnemployment in Poland, the European Union's growing economic powerhouse, is edging higher, reaching 5.6% in November compared to 5% a year earlier. Romania and the Czech Republic are also seeing similar upticks in joblessness.\n\nThe softening of the labor market has prompted new terms like the Great Hesitation, where companies think twice about hiring and workers are cautious about quitting stressful jobs, and Career Cushioning, quietly preparing a backup plan in case of layoffs.\n\nAcross Europe, however, the overall picture remains far from bleak. Spain, which is benefitting from a post-COVID tourism boom, is set for another bumper year of jobs growth, along with Luxembourg, Ireland, Croatia, Portugal and Greece, according to the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, an official EU agency. Even in countries experiencing weaker growth, pockets of strong worker demand remain.\n\n\"What felt like a widespread scarcity of workers during the Great Resignation has become more sector-specific,\" Julian Stahl, labor market expert for the online recruiter XING, told DW. \"There are still serious shortages in retail, health care, logistics, engineering and other highly specialized roles.\"\n\nGermany's industrial base has borne the brunt of the job losses in recent months, particularly in the automotive, machinery, metals and textiles sectors. High energy costs, weak export demand and fierce competition from China have erased more than 120,000 positions, government data show.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThose same pressures are hitting manufacturers in France, Italy and Poland just as hard, pushing the eurozone's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) down to 48.8 in December, its lowest reading in nine months. Readings above 50.0 indicate growth in activity, while those below point to contraction.\n\n\"Most firms are aiming to hold the line or shrink slightly rather than grow,\" said Stahl, adding that hiring hasn't \"stopped completely.\"\n\nNegative headlines about manufacturing job cuts appear to be causing reputational damage among Europe's most treasured industries, says Bettina Schaller Bossert, president of the World Employment Confederation, a global nonprofit representing the private employment services industry and based in Brussels, Belgium.\n\n\"A lot of young graduates believe there is no future in the automotive sector. They're not interested in pursuing careers [with European carmakers] even though there are fantastic new opportunities,\" Schaller Bossert told DW.\n\nEurope has rolled out AI far more slowly than the United States and China, held back by lower investment, stricter regulation and lagging adoption. But that hasn't eased employee anxiety that automation will quickly replace humans at work, especially after negative predictions of millions of job losses ahead.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nA study by consulting giant EY published in July found that a quarter of Europe's workers fear AI could put their own jobs at risk, while 74% believe firms will need a smaller headcount as a result of the technology.\n\nIn November, the Nuremberg-based Institute for Employment Research (IAB) projected that 1.6 million jobs in Germany alone could be reshaped by or lost to AI by 2040. The agency of the German labor office foresees that high-skilled positions will be disproportionately hit, although the tech sector could create around 110,000 new jobs.\n\nEnzo Webe, head of the IAB's forecasting department, said in the report AI would lead to a \"transformation\" of the labor market, but \"not less work.\"\n\nOther predictions range from the emergence of a so-called AI precariat —  entire populations that are not just jobless or underemployed, but have lost their purpose, identity and social belonging — to more optimistic views that argue AI will redistribute work, not eliminate whole professions.\n\n\"A lot of drudge tasks can be pushed to AI to free up human labor,\" John Springford, a labor market expert at the Centre for European Reform, told DW. \"But there's a good reason to believe that professional, knowledge work won't shrink.\"\n\nAnthony Klotz, the University College London professor who coined the term the Great Resignation, argues in his upcoming book \"Jolted\" that quitting jobs is less about long-term dissatisfaction and more about sudden moments of clarity.\n\nFor many European workers, the rapid advance of AI could become exactly that kind of jolt, a catalyst that prompts them to move preemptively, before automation reshapes their roles for them.",

    "description": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s AI engine inside the Pentagon network.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google’s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military’s data as possible into the developing technology.\n\n“Very soon we will have the world’s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,” Hegseth said in a speech at Musk’s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after Grok — which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk — drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.\n\nMalaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.’s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.\n\nHegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would “make all appropriate data” from the military’s IT systems available for “AI exploitation.” He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.\n\nHegseth’s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.\n\nThe Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.\n\nDuring his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, “We need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.”\n\nHe noted that the Pentagon possesses “combat-proven operational data from two decades of military and intelligence operations.”\n\n“AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we’re going to make sure that it’s there,” Hegseth said.\n\nThe defense secretary said he wants AI systems within the Pentagon to be responsible, though he went on to say he was shrugging off any AI models “that won’t allow you to fight wars.”\n\nHegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate “without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,” before adding that the Pentagon’s “AI will not be woke.”\n\nMusk developed and pitched Grok as an alternative to what he called “woke AI” interactions from rival chatbots like Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s ChatGPT. In July, Grok also caused controversy after it appeared to make antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and shared several antisemitic posts.\n\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to questions about the issues with Grok.",

    "fullText": "Despite internet blackout, a small number of Iranians are risking their lives to share messages as protests continue\n\nFor most of Iran, the internet was shut off on Thursday afternoon – the most severe blackout the country has seen in years of internet shutdowns, coming after days of escalating anti-government protests.\n\nFor a very small sliver of the country, it is still possible to get photos and videos to the outside world, and even to make calls. The Telegram channel Vahid Online on Monday posted photos of dead bodies lying next to a street in Kahrizak, on the southern outskirts of Tehran; on Sunday, it shared a video of Iranians chanting “death to Khamenei” at a funeral.\n\nSome of these videos and messages are transmitted through an ecosystem of online tools designed to bypass censorship – among them Telegram proxies, a decentralised messaging service called Delta Chat, and a browser called Ceno, said Amir Rashidi, an Iranian digital rights expert.\n\nThere are about 50,000 Starlink terminals now in Iran, said Rashidi; other reports put this number at up to 100,000. The users of the service – which is part of Elon Musk’s SpaceX – are a tiny fraction of Iran’s overall population of more than 90 million people.\n\nWhile multiple people – even a whole apartment block – might be able to connect to the internet via a single Starlink terminal, the number of total users in the entire country is at most in the hundreds of thousands, said Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at Kentik, a network observability and intelligence platform.\n\nThey hold Iran’s last tenuous link to the outside world. Very little information, at least electronically, appears to be leaving the country, except for minimal traffic from businesses and individuals whitelisted by the regime.\n\nAcross Iran, authorities are hunting for Starlink terminals – jamming whole neighbourhoods using tools developed for electronic warfare, and flying drones over rooftops to search for telltale satellite dishes, say sources. Under a law passed in 2025, possessing a Starlink terminal in Iran can be interpreted as espionage for Israel and is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\n\n“They have basically criminalised Starlink to the extent that they’re saying in the law [that] if you use Starlink it’s the equivalent of conducting espionage operations for Israel and the American CIA,” said Rashidi.\n\nIt is unclear how many terminals are still operating, and how many have been confiscated, he added.\n\nThe tools Iran appears to be using to jam the terminals are military-grade, similar to those used to jam drones on the frontlines of Ukraine, said Rashidi. They are expensive and energy-intensive, capable of knocking out a certain radio frequency within a given area, but can only be used locally and cannot blanket the country.\n\n“It’s not cheap. It’s something you’d find in a military arsenal, and there’s only a few types of suppliers,” said Madory.\n\nFor now, the few who have smuggled Starlink terminals can connect online, although in neighbourhoods with heavy jamming it is nearly impossible to do more than send messages. The tech-savvy among them are using VPNs to disguise their presence; others are simply hauling their terminals from place to place to avoid detection.\n\nWhile Starlink users can communicate for now, Iran could choose – though it would be difficult – to track them down.\n\n“Depending on how much effort the Iranian government wanted to put into it, they could trace the signals that use the particular frequency those terminals have to use,” said Madory. “You’re kind of announcing yourself.”\n\nFor those without a terminal, an announcement on a state-linked Telegram channel has given a preview to the potential future of the internet in Iran. The IRIB news agency yesterday published a list of all internet sites that would now be available in Iran.\n\nThese included domestic search engines, domestic maps and navigation services, domestic messaging apps, and even a domestic streaming service – an Iranian version of Netflix, said Rashidi, with only government-approved videos.\n\nAll of these sites are part of Iran’s effort to create a national internet, said Rashidi: a skeleton version of the web that is significantly more restricted than even China’s, managed by the government and virtually unconnected to the outside world. That effort has been under way since the Rouhani administration, and now appears to be working, he said.\n\nWhat this could mean, said Madory and Rashidi, is that Iran’s internet as it was may not come back.\n\n“There are rumours,” said Rashidi. “Some people are saying that if things go back normal, there won’t be the internet. There will be only the national internet.”\n\n“They’re gearing up for the long run, for this to be the way things are for an extended period of time,” said Madory.",

    "fullText": "After Apple chose Gemini to power Siri, Alphabet surpassed Apple to become second-most valuable company in world\n\nGoogle’s parent company hit a major financial milestone on Monday, reaching a $4tn valuation for the first time and surpassing Apple to become the second-most valuable company in the world.\n\nAlphabet is the fourth company to hit the $4tn milestone after Nvidia, which later hit $5tn, Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe spike in share price comes after Apple announced it had chosen Google’s Gemini AI model to power a major overhaul of the iPhone maker’s digital assistant Siri, which comes installed in every iPhone. Neither company disclosed how much the deal was worth.\n\n“After careful evaluation, we determined that Google’s technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,” Apple said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nAs tech stocks continue a years-long meteoric rise, fears of a bubble in the stock market persist; however, Wall Street’s excitement for new avenues of investment in AI does as well. Alphabet’s milestones signal a remarkable change in investor sentiment for Alphabet, with its stock surging about 65% in 2025, outperforming its peers on Wall Street’s elite group of stocks, the so-called “Magnificent Seven”.\n\nThe tech giant has allayed investors’ doubts about its artificial intelligence strategy in recent months with a series of high-profile product launches, including the latest version of its flagship AI model, Gemini, and the popular Nano Banana image generator and editor. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT and Google’s insurgent rival, left investors and consumers underwhelmed with the release of its latest model, GPT-5, which allowed Alphabet to surge ahead.\n\nGoogle, best known for making the world’s most popular search engine and browser, has also turned its once-overlooked cloud unit into a major growth engine, which drew a rare tech investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Google Cloud’s revenue jumped 34% in the third quarter, with a backlog of non-recognized sales contracts rising to $155bn. Renting out Google’s self-developed AI chips that were reserved for internal use to outside customers has also enabled the unit’s breakneck pace of growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the company’s dominant revenue generator – the advertising business, driven by Google Search and YouTube – has largely held steady in the face of economic uncertainty and intense competition.\n\nThe company has faced two landmark US antitrust suits as it has navigated its place in the AI boom. After Google lost the first case, a judge ruled in September against breaking up the company, allowing it to retain control of its Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system.\n\nIn the second case, a judge ruled Google had illegally monopolized the online ad market last April. A trial over how to remedy the monopoly began in September, which could see the judge forcing Google to divest parts of its lucrative ads business to foster competition.",

Nobody who has ever met a teenager, or read the news, will be completely at ease with the role of social media in young lives. There are horrific effects, which have been well documented and inadequately addressed ever since the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017 after viewing suicide and self-harm content online.\n\nMany platforms, even those that seem anodyne, are purpose-built to spur anxiety, self-doubt, self-harm, anything that delivers attention. We have this completely contradictory environment in which a nine-year-old can’t walk to school alone without turning into grist for a radio phone-in about parental neglect, and yet tech companies with a record of generating emotional distress for profit are allowed access to children’s bedrooms. Grok can generate sexualised images of children on demand, and the UK government calls it a matter for Ofcom.\n\nThe asymmetry of acceptable risk between the real world and the virtual, even while we can see that online harms show up soon enough in lived experience, is inexplicable. It must be more baffling still if you happen to be under 16, working on the assumption that the adults telling you what to do must know what they’re talking about.\n\nEven at the milder end, a lot of social media apps seem designed to mess with a young mind. Take the problems created by location services, whereby kids are able to see one another’s whereabouts 24/7, so discovering in real time what they haven’t been invited to and what their ex-best friend is up to; or the intolerable body-image pressure of a life lived in selfies; or the stress of the streak (a chain of back-and-forth messages or pictures), friendships torched by a slow reply.\n\nIn short, not everything is wrong with Badenoch’s idea; only two things. First, if there’s one thing more ridiculous than taking a corporate failure and throwing it to the individual to solve, by self-discipline reinforced by legislation, it is doing so to under-16s. If a corporation is selling radical misogyny and methods for self-harm – because what else are they going to do, disappoint shareholders? – that is not for a 12-year-old to fix by turning off their phone and taking up crochet. It’s not for a parent to fix, either, by instituting a load of screen limits and parental blocks; even if you enjoy that side of things, it shouldn’t be up to you to fill late-capitalism’s moral void. You could make the case for government intervention, but only if it had time on its hands after tackling the problem at source.\n\nSecond, while young people are unarguably the target of so much manipulative content, to discuss online risks without mentioning older people is frankly perverse. An X user recently asked Grok to identify misinformation super-spreaders on the site from the UK, and probably the youngest among them were Tommy Robinson, 43, and Darren Grimes, 32.. This was data crunched from Amnesty, Global Witness and the BBC, among others, and helpfully built a list of accounts most likely to promulgate untruth or conspiracy, with the caveat it was “subjective and depends on sources”: Nigel Farage, Laurence Fox, Julia Hartley-Brewer, George Galloway, Katie Hopkins, David Icke. None are of a tender age. Between Gen X miscreants and hyper-credulous boomers, there are generations that pose a greater risk to, and are themselves at risk from, the informational ecosystem. Any thinking politician needs to work out how to deal with them.",

From AirDrop and Handoff to AirPlay, they all connect macOS and iOS devices wirelessly. In recent years, security researchers have opened up several of these features showing that the Apple ecosystem is technically compatible with third-party devices.\n\nIn this talk, we present the internal workings of Low-Latency WiFi (LLW) – Apple's link-layer protocol for several real-time Continuity features like Continuity Camera and Sidecar Display. We talk about the concepts behind LLW, how it achieves its low-latency requirement and how we got there in the reverse engineering process.\n\nWe also present the tooling we built to enable more kernel-level tracing and logging on iOS through a reimplementation of cctool from macOS and the source code of trace that was buried deep inside of Apple’s open-source repository system_cmds. We build a log aggregator that combines various kernel- and user-space traces, log messages and pcap files from both iOS and macOS into a single file and finally investigate the network stack on Apple platforms that is implemented in both user- and kernel space. There we find interesting configuration values of LLW that make it the go-to link-layer protocol for Apple's proprietary real-time Continuity applications.\n\nLicensed to the public under http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\n\nThis Talk was translated into multiple languages.

    "description": "An AI-powered X-ray tomography breakthrough reveals nanoscale details despite missing data and limited viewing angles.",
    "fullText": "This 3D image of an integrated circuit showing slices through its thickness was reconstructed with a new technique that incorporates artificial intelligence called the \"perception fused iterative tomography reconstruction engine.\" (Brookhaven National Laboratory)\n\nX-ray tomography is a powerful tool that enables scientists and engineers to peer inside of objects in 3D, including computer chips and advanced battery materials, without performing anything invasive. It’s the same basic method behind medical CT scans. Scientists or technicians capture X-ray images as an object is rotated, and then advanced software mathematically reconstructs the object’s 3D internal structure. But imaging fine details on the nanoscale, like features on a microchip, requires a much higher spatial resolution than a typical medical CT scan — about 10,000 times higher.\n\nThe Hard X-ray Nanoprobe (HXN) beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II), a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science user facility at DOE’s Brookhaven National Laboratory, is able to achieve that kind of resolution with X-rays that are more than a billion times brighter than traditional CT scans.\n\nTomography only works well when these projection images can be taken from all angles. In many real-world cases, however, that’s impossible. For example, scientists can’t spin a flat computer chip around 180 degrees without blocking some of the X-rays. When parallel to the surface at high angles, fewer X-rays can penetrate the chip, limiting the viewing angles of the measurement. The missing data from this angular range produces a “blind spot,” leading the reconstruction software to produce blurry, distorted images.\n\n“We call this the ‘missing wedge’ problem,” said Hanfei Yan, lead beamline scientist at the HXN beamline and corresponding author of this work. “For decades, this problem has limited the applications of X-ray and electron tomography in many areas of science and technology.”\n\nTo solve the problem, researchers at NSLS-II have developed a new method called the perception fused iterative tomography reconstruction engine (PFITRE). This novel approach combines the physics of X-rays with the power of artificial intelligence (AI). The team trained a convolutional neural network, a type of AI model that automatically learns data patterns, with simulated data. Convolutional neural networks use convolutional layers to detect important features, such as edges, textures, or shapes, and combine these features to make predictions, like identifying what’s in an image. The AI component captures perceptual knowledge about the sample, what the team expects the solution should look like, and uses it to improve the reconstructed image based on that knowledge. Meanwhile, the physics-based model checks that the results still make sense scientifically. This process repeats several times until results from the AI and physics components converge, producing a reconstruction that is both accurate and visually clear. Their results were recently published in npj Computational Materials.\n\nThis 3D image of an integrated circuit shows slices through its thickness. The figure compares results from three datasets: one created using the full set of angles, one reconstructed with a new technique called the perception fused iterative tomography reconstruction engine (PFITRE) method, and one using today's \"gold standard\" method, fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA). (Brookhaven National Laboratory)\n\nUnlike image correction in consumer tech, like cell phone cameras, scientific imaging must preserve accuracy, not just appearance. Scientists needed to devise a method to ensure that the corrected image is still consistent with the physical model and data. To do this, NSLS-II scientists embedded the AI into an iterative solving engine, a mathematical tool that tackles complex problems by repeatedly trying improved solutions, step by step, until it gets close enough to the right answer. The embedded AI acts as a “smart” regularizer, a function that limits overcorrection, leveraging physics-based modeling to ensure that the reconstructions stay faithful to the actual X-ray measurements.\n\n“We didn’t want an AI that just makes better images. We wanted an AI that works hand-in-hand with physics, so that the results are both visually clear and scientifically trustworthy,” said Chonghang Zhao, a postdoc at HXN and lead author of this work. “That’s the power of our method — combining the sophistication of AI with the physical model to ensure fidelity.”\n\nThe AI in PFITRE is built on a type of neural network called a U-net architecture, an encoder-decoder design that is popular for general image processing. The encoder stage learns and detects essential features, such as the edges, textures, and shapes of an input image, and the decoder stage rebuilds the image using those features to restore details and correct distortions. The researchers enhanced the ability of U-net with structural modifications called residual dense blocks and dilated convolutions. These help the network capture information across multiple scales from fine textures to larger structures, making the network more suitable for handling the missing wedge problem in tomography. A model like this can’t learn on its own, though. It needs significant amounts of data to train on.\n\nReal scientific microscopy datasets are too limited for effective training in a specific AI model like PFITRE, so the team relied on synthetic data. They generated training datasets by using natural images, simulated patterns, and scanning electron microscope images of circuits as samples being imaged. To make the training as realistic as possible, they introduced a “digital twin” of the experiment and created virtual data that mimics real-world conditions. They intentionally included noise, misalignment, and other imperfections so the AI could handle physical data.\n\nWhile there is still work to be done to perfect this method, the benefits are clear. Samples that were once inaccessible due to their size or geometry can now produce informative data. A larger field of view allows more of a sample to be analyzed without falling victim to the missing wedge. This method could also prove beneficial in experiments where fewer measurements are required, enabling faster in situ studies and reducing radiation dose in sensitive samples.\n\n“This opens the door to detailed imaging of samples that couldn’t be studied before. That’s a very big step forward,” Yan said. “Whether it’s diagnosing defects in microchips or understanding why a battery degrades, PFITRE allows us to see details under conditions that were previously considered infeasible.”\n\nWhile PFITRE is a major advance, the team acknowledges room for improvement. Currently, the method processes 3D objects slice by slice. Expanding it into a full 3D approach would further enhance consistency but require more computation. Another challenge is including more artifacts, like ones from faulty pixels or sample movement, to broaden its application range. Like other AI models, it can’t fix issues that have not been “seen” before. To address this, future work will incorporate building a richer training dataset that includes many types of artifacts and developing ways for the model to learn more effectively with less training.\n\nThis new, powerful 3D image analysis method has the potential to accelerate discoveries across many fields, from developing faster, more efficient microchips to synthesis of new materials and even biomedical applications. As machine learning and synchrotron science continue to evolve together, tools like this will sharpen scientists’ view of the microscopic world to address some of society’s greatest scientific challenges.\n\nBrookhaven National Laboratory is supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy.

    "fullText": "Tik-Tok is a 1983 science fiction novel by American writer John Sladek. It received a 1983 British Science Fiction Association Award.\n\nThe title character is an intelligent robot (named after the mechanical man in the Oz books) who originally works as a domestic servant and house-painter. Unlike other robots, whose behavior is constrained by \"asimov circuits\"—a reference to Isaac Asimov's fictional Three Laws of Robotics, which require robots to protect and serve humans—Tik-Tok finds that he can do as he pleases, and he secretly commits various hideous crimes for his amusement. After manipulating both robots and humans to cause chaos and bloodshed, Tik-Tok becomes wealthy (partly through health care privatization) and is finally elected Vice President of the United States.\n\nThe novel gleefully satirizes Asimov's relatively benign view of how robots would serve humanity, suggesting that the reality would be exactly akin to slavery: robots are worked until they drop and are made the victims of humans' worst appetites, including rape. Like Sladek's earlier novel Roderick, it also mocks the notion of the Three Laws of Robotics and suggests that there is no way such complex moral principles could be hard-wired into any intelligent being; Tik-Tok decides that the \"asimov circuits\" are in fact a collective delusion, or a form of religion, which robots have been tricked into believing. This liberation from tradition, while it makes him a cruel sociopath and nihilist, also provides him with intellectual insight and artistic talent; thus Tik-Tok is an extreme type of Romantic anti-hero.\n\nSladek's love of word play is apparent: the book contains 26 chapters, and the first word of each chapter begins with a consecutive letter of the alphabet. Also, the first three words of the book are \"As I move\", a reference to Asimov.\n\nTik-Tok so far has seen five editions in the English language, spread over three different publishers: Gollancz (who published the first edition and two later editions); DAW Books (1985) and Corgi (1984).[1]\n\nIn 1985 Tik-Tok was translated into the German as Tick-Tack, published by Ullstein-Verlag, and into the Italian as Robot fuorilegge, published by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore as part of the Urania series. In 1988 it was translated into the Finnish as Tik-Tok, published by Karisto oy. A French translation followed as Tik-Tok (1998), published by Éditions Denoël.[1]\n\nDave Langford reviewed Tik-Tok for White Dwarf #49, and stated that \"a murderously funny romp through yet another Sladekian satirical future.\"[2]\n\nDave Pringle reviewed Tik-Tok for Imagine magazine, and stated that \"Tik-Tok murders little children, among others, and yet somehow Sladek keeps us laughing.\"[3]",

    "description": "A new study reveals that some smart dogs can learn words just by overhearing humans’ conversations",
    "fullText": "Your Dog Might Be Eavesdropping on You\n\nA new study reveals that some smart dogs can learn words just by overhearing humans’ conversations\n\nJoin Our Community of Science Lovers!\n\nMost dog owners are aware that their pooch is smart enough to know a few choice phrases—“walkies,” for instance, or, perhaps more likely, “time for dinner.” Some particularly intelligent canines can even identify more than 100 words. And incredibly, a few “genius” doggies may be able to learn words not by being taught but purely by eavesdropping on human conversations.\n\nIn a new study published in Science on Thursday, researchers at Eötvös Loránd University in Hungary found that a small group of “gifted” dogs can learn the names of new toys just by overhearing their owners talk about the items. For comparison, that is about the same language learning skills as an 18-month-old child.\n\nThe researchers asked dog owners to have a conversation with another person in their household and name-drop two new toys in front of their pets but without directly addressing the animals. Afterward the owners placed the pair of toys in a separate room alongside a handful of others and asked their dogs to retrieve one of the novel playthings. The dogs were able to pick out the new toys after overhearing their owners just as well as if they were shown these toys and then told to find the objects.\n\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

They’re able to parse out the name of the label and attach it correctly to that item,” says Heidi Lyn, a comparative psychologist and an associate professor at the University of South Alabama, who was not involved with the study. “That’s a pretty sophisticated attentional and cognitive leap that they’re making.”\n\nSimilar skills have been seen in other animals, such as apes and parrots. The new research offers proof that some dogs can learn some words even when they are not addressed directly by their owners, says Nameera Akhtar, a psychology professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was also not involved in the study. Still, she caveats, the dogs involved in the study were particularly smart, so perhaps not all pooches will be so astute.\n\nIt’s unclear how exactly such “gifted” dogs learn or why some dogs seem so much more able to pick up new words and phrases than others.\n\nDror, who recently lost her dog of 15 years, a schipperke named Mitos, says she hopes the new study will help dog owners better appreciate their canine companions’ ability to heed social cues.\n\n“I think we should all try to pay more attention to the way we interact around our dogs and with our dogs,” she says, “the way we stand, the way we look at them, the way we say our words.”\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, I’d like to ask for your support.

    "description": "Americans love trying to upgrade their brains — one scoop, zap, or gaming session at a time",
    "fullText": "At this point, you've probably at least thought about dropping a few scoops of creatine into your morning smoothie. An amino acid compound that promotes energy production in brain and muscle cells, it's been a gym staple for building muscle for decades. In recent years, researchers have started to unpack creatine's potential cognition-boosting benefits, including promising early studies for sleep-deprived people and Alzheimer's patients.\n\nAt the Vitamin Shoppe, sales of creatine are up 320% since 2019, the company said in its 2025 trend report. Searches for \"creatine gummies\" spiked 1,300% last year, while the powder remains a \"mainstay.\"\n\nIf supplements aren't your thing, but gaining a neuro edge is, you might have considered a brain-training headset, which promises to combat brain aging and cognitive decline, as well as improve sleep. Or a game that promises help with the symptoms of adult ADHD.\n\nConsumer products that promise sharper thinking, calmer moods, and a cognitive edge are suddenly everywhere.\n\nMeta and Apple are developing, patenting, or acquiring devices we could soon wear around our wrists, on the collars of our shirts, or inside our nostrils to improve our mood — and maybe even \"boost\" intelligence by providing a kind of IQ-enhancing adrenaline boost for the brain. Much of the new brain tech is being driven by AI, which enables more real-time feedback.\n\nBrain hacking is also becoming a high-end perk at some workplaces.\n\nIn 2014, there were just 41 consumer neurotech companies, according to a recent report from the Centre for Future Generations. By 2024, that number had soared to 153, outpacing medical device manufacturing for the brain.\n\nAnd who wouldn't want a little brain enhancement?\n\nA rapidly aging population that's increasingly extending working lives well into the golden years, longevity-focused biohackers, and women looking for treatments for menopause-related brain fog all add up to a potentially massive consumer base.\n\n\"People want to find that one magic thing: one magic game or app or something that makes you better at a whole suite of things in a super short time,\" UCSD cognitive neuroscientist Bradley Voytek, who studies how brain communication changes as we age, told Business Insider.\n\nIt all sounds great, right? But what does science have to say about any of this?\n\nThe trouble with optimizing our brains is that no two brains work the same way. The question worth asking is not so much what the human brain needs, but rather what your brain needs.\n\nDepending on the answer, you might be better off pursuing something that's tailored to your specific needs or goals, rather than a mass-marketed brain booster.\n\nTake creatine. An emerging body of research focused on older adults suggests that it can improve sleep and potentially help stave off cognitive decline. Large, well-controlled studies are scarce, especially for younger, generally healthy individuals. That's not to say that creatine is bad; it's just that it may help you build muscle but not meaningfully improve cognition.\n\nDoctors generally suggest blood testing for nutritional deficiencies before you start taking supplements. That same advice holds for fancy, brain-boosting tech.\n\nSimilarly, a lot of neuro-edge devices might offer some benefit. They may not address your precise concerns or your very specific, long-term cognitive vulnerabilities.\n\n\"The way you improve cognition is to work around the areas of weakness,\" says neuroscientist Dean Sherzai, the executive director of clinical research at Charles R. Drew University and best-selling author of \"The Alzheimer's Solution.\" \"You build it back up.\"\n\nThere are some things, of course, that are good for everyone. Quality sleep. Regular, moderate-to-intense exercise. A healthy, nutrient-rich diet. Meaningful social interaction. Virtually every neuroscientist agrees on this foundational, grandma-approved advice.\n\nThere is also promising research around the power of brain games.\n\nBrainHQ, which sells a mind-training program, released a study in partnership with McGill University in Canada that found that adults aged 65 and up, who did the exercises for 30 minutes a day for 10 weeks, experienced a roughly 2% increase in their acetylcholine levels — a key brain chemical that aids in movement, memory, and learning.\n\nBrain-body training can also offer clear benefits for various aspects of cognition, including visual perception, balance, coordination, focus, relaxation, and working memory.\n\nThat can be great for anyone hoping to promote a performance edge, whether they're a professional athlete or a stock trader.\n\nSome companies are taking note, and offering such training as a high-end perk.\n\nLast year, JLL, the commercial real estate giant, set up a \"brain gym\" in its Singapore office that was outfitted with the same kind of gear that high-performance athletes use to train their brains, like lighted pods and vision training boards.\n\n\"Wouldn't you want those people to be 1% more high performing or more focused or more productive?\" said Ben Hamley, JLL's global head of research and development. He said employees who participated saw improvements to their focus, including being better able to resist distractions.\n\nFor all the options, experts say that consumers are left to figure out what they, personally, need most and filter through what's bogus versus what could be good for them — and do it all on their own.\n\nNone of the neuroscientists I interviewed for this story said they personally use brain games or pulsating devices regularly — at least, not yet.\n\nExperts agree that one of the most important things you can do is to continuously challenge yourself in the real world. This might include discovering new places, engaging in deep conversations with other people, and picking up a new skill, such as a foreign language or a musical instrument.\n\n\"If you're not getting in nature and walking and interacting with other people, you are missing core ingredients of keeping a healthy brain,\" says Dr. Adam Gazzaley, founder and executive director of the University of California San Francisco's Neuroscape center.\n\nGazzaley believes in the power of technology to help train our brains — he spent 15 years developing what became EndeavorOTC, the first video game approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult ADHD.\n\nHe also sees its limits. \"No amount of hacks are going to help,\" he said, if you haven't built that healthy foundation. \"Watching TV all day would be the opposite example of that, where you just passively, like a fire hose, have information flood into your brain as opposed to interactively pushing yourself and thinking and interpreting information that's outside of your normal inputs,\" he said.\n\nFor all the exciting promise of neurotech products, what we'll most benefit from is the right device, the right technique, the right prescription, and all at the right time.\n\nFor now, we don't quite understand how to exercise each person's brain in the most effective way every day.\n\nVoytek, the neuroscience professor, says when students come to him struggling with focus or are unable to complete assignments, he never suggests brain training.\n\n\"I would recommend sleep,\" he said.",

    "title": "Trump's big swing at credit card interest rates targets a growing American problem",
    "description": "Americans' debt loads are at record highs, resurfacing a decadeslong debate on how to prevent companies from maximizing profit at consumers' expense.",
    "fullText": "Americans are racking up credit card debt, and it's costing them even more to get rid of it.\n\nIt's a piece of the affordability debate that has caught the attention of both parties.\n\nIn a move that has been pushed for by lawmakers across the aisle, President Donald Trump on January 9 called for a one-year, 10% cap on credit-card interest rates. He wrote in a Truth Social post that he would call for the cap to begin on January 20.\n\n\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" Trump wrote.\n\nThe easiest path for Trump to cap interest rates would be through congressional legislation. While it's unclear if the proposal would make it through Congress and onto the president's desk, given that similar legislation has yet to become law, Sen. Elizabeth Warren signaled she would work with the president on making it happen.\n\nWarren said in a statement that during a Monday call with Trump, she \"told him that Congress can pass legislation to cap credit card rates if he will actually fight for it.\"\n\nHowever, beyond the mechanics of the proposal, the underlying sentiment — that credit card companies have \"ripped off\" consumers by charging excessive interest — is an issue that has plagued the US for decades as debt loads continue to rise.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2025, the most recent period for which data is available, credit card debt reached a record high of $1.23 trillion — a $24 billion increase from the previous quarter and a $67 billion increase from Q3 2024.\n\nTrump promised a 10% credit-card interest rate cap on the campaign trail, and his latest announcement follows recent bipartisan legislation pushing for a similar move.\n\nIn February 2025, Sens. Bernie Sanders and Josh Hawley introduced a bill capping rates at 10% for five years, with the GOP's Hawley saying in a statement at the time that \"working Americans are drowning in record credit card debt while the biggest credit card issuers get richer and richer by hiking their interest rates to the moon.\"\n\nEven as the Federal Reserve has stepped in to broadly lower interest rates, credit card rates have edged down but remained near record highs over the past year. That means that the Americans trying to chip away at their record-high credit card debt are paying more on those outstanding balances.\n\nIt's not a glitch in the system that consumers are getting trapped by high interest rates — it's a feature, consumer protection experts previously told Business Insider. Hidden fees and shady terms can pull consumers in, and they won't realize what they signed up for until it's too late, Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, said.\n\n\"Credit-card companies can get away with charging high rates of interest because consumers aren't necessarily paying attention, and marketing doesn't focus on that,\" Rust said.\n\nAt the same time, as creditors accrue higher debt loads and contend with higher interest rates, an increasing share of loans is simply going unpaid for 30 days or more.\n\nThere's limited legal recourse for consumers. A 1978 Supreme Court decision allowed banks headquartered in states without usury laws — which aim to prevent companies from unfairly enriching themselves at the expense of borrowers — to set their own interest rates without impunity.\n\nOversight over the industry is lacking, especially after the Trump administration moved to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB conducts oversight of the industry and found, in a 2023 report, that credit-card companies charged consumers over $105 billion in interest in 2022, helping to boost their profit margins from 4.5% in 2019 to 5.9%.\n\nSome credit-card companies took issue with Trump's proposal. A joint statement from the Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum, and Independent Community Bankers of America said that the \"cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives\" such as personal and payday loans. Banks typically use higher interest rates to compensate for customers who might not be able to pay back their loans.",

    "description": "After months on hold, PE firms moved fast — and recruiters say the delay produced more prepared candidates when on-cycle finally returned.",
    "fullText": "After a roughly six-month pause, private equity's on-cycle recruiting machine roared back to life last week. The process was just as frenzied, but recruiters said the extra time produced an unexpected upside: sharper, better-prepared candidates.\n\nThe hiring restart came just as first-year bankers returned from the winter holidays. Firms began outreach for 2027 associate roles they had originally planned to fill in the summer, before banks cracked down on the practice. In recent years, the timeline had crept steadily earlier, with 2024's process kicking off in June, before many analysts had even hit the desk.\n\nBlackstone, Apollo, KKR, and Thoma Bravo were among the more than a dozen firms that interviewed candidates and extended offers, according to people familiar with the process. Some firms declined or did not respond to requests for comment. But sources said the cycle's customary theatrics — late-night interviews, exploding offers — were back in full force.\n\nIn some cases, candidates spent most of the day inside the offices of the industry's largest buyout firms, the people said, declining to be identified to preserve professional relationships. Most interviews took place on January 5, with some extending into the following day.\n\nA first-year investment banker at a bulge-bracket firm who went through the process said offices were overflowing. \"You show up, and depending on the firm, it could be up to 100 kids in suits crowding the lobby at the same time,\" the banker said. \"It was chaos.\"\n\nHe snagged an offer after spending from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. at one firm, but under pressure. The firm asked him to sign his offer on the spot, he said, before he could exit the building.\n\nRecruiters Business Insider spoke to said the added time junior bankers had spent on the job made a noticeable difference.\n\n\"There has been a considerable dissatisfaction over the last couple of years from buyside firms not being able to fill their associate classes through on-cycle recruiting, driven by how early the process started and how unprepared firms found the bankers they met to be,\" said Anthony Keizner, managing partner at Odyssey Search Partners.\n\n\"Since the bankers being interviewed now have had five months' deal experience, they are typically much more competent, able to pass financial modeling tests, and understand deal mechanics better,\" Keizner added. \"This year's initial take is that PE firms are happier as a result, and seem to be filling a higher proportion of their associate class from this process.\"\n\nThis latest hiring sprint followed months of pressure from Wall Street banks to slow a process that, over the past half-decade, had shifted from starting in October to starting in June or July — often right as first-year bankers were beginning their jobs after college graduation.\n\nLast year, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had enough.\n\nAfter calling the practice \"unethical,\" Dimon's top bankers in June warned incoming analysts that accepting future-dated offers — even participating in interviews — would get them fired. \"You will be provided notice and your employment with the firm will end,\" the firm's global banking coheads wrote in a memo.\n\nPrivate equity firms, including Apollo, General Atlantic, and TPG, quickly announced decisions to pause recruiting plans til 2026 soon as a result of Dimon's warning.\n\nInsiders were bracing for recruiting to resume in January. \"A lot of people used the December break as a good way to prepare,\" Matt Ting, the founder of the interview prep firm Peak Frameworks, said via email. \"Compared to when the last few cycles have kicked off, candidates got way more prep time this year.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether firms filled up more of their class in this cycle than in previous years. A spokesperson for Apollo said the firm generally fills less than half its associate class through on-cycle recruiting.\n\n\"Hiring decisions are among the most consequential we make, and we have led the industry toward a more rational approach,\" the spokesperson said in an emailed statement, adding: \"We generally fill less than 50% of our class in on-cycle recruiting.\"\n\nThe recruiting stampede began with a swift start.\n\nOn January 4, several candidates received late Sunday night emails inviting them to early-morning meetings the following day — sometimes characterized as informal get-to-know-you \"coffee chats\" with PE firms' external recruiters — according to people who participated. Some were told to bring laptops and plan to set aside multiple hours, signals that the formal process was about to begin.\n\nCandidates rotated through multiple conversations, completed financial modeling tests in private rooms, and waited, sometimes for hours.\n\n\"It's not like you can say you'll set up an 8 a.m. at Blackstone and an 11 a.m. at Apollo,\" the first-year banker said. \"If you do well at the first, you have to be there all day.\"\n\nOne former private-equity megafund associate said a candidate he advised during the process was held at a firm's office for nearly 13 hours as interviews dragged on, only to be sent home empty-handed at the end.\n\nDespite banks' warnings last summer and demands that entry-level employees sign pledges against accepting outside offers, several people involved in last week's hiring said Wall Street's pressure campaign didn't seem to deter most candidates from participating.\n\nWhether the success of this year's delayed cycle becomes a selling point for the industry to change its ways over the long term is an open question. Private equity recruiting has repeatedly drifted earlier — so whether firms begin hiring for 2028 roles this summer may be the first clue.\n\n\"It'll be interesting to see if they again wait till the new year, or return to interviewing even earlier in the career of the first-year investment banking analysts,\" Keizner said.",

    "description": "Matthew Landry, a nutrition researcher and dietitian, studies how what we eat can prevent heart attacks later in life.",
    "fullText": "A nutrition researcher and dietitian who studies how simple habits can protect our hearts shared three simple food swaps.\n\nCardiovascular disease is the No. 1 cause of death in the US, but research has found that eating a Mediterranean-style diet and being physically active can help lower the risk. The American Heart Association's dietary guidelines recommend prioritizing fresh produce, whole grains, lean proteins such as fish, and limiting ultra-processed foods and refined sugar.\n\nThat may sound like a lot, but Matthew Landry told Business Insider that you don't necessarily need to overhaul your diet to improve your heart health.\n\nLandy, an assistant professor at the University of California, Irvine, suggested considering: \"how can we make simple swaps with our diet? How can we engage in more physical activity, and do very simple things that all add up to help prevent a heart attack later?\"\n\nHere are his three suggestions:\n\nLandry's first swap relates to the type of fat used for cooking. He suggests switching butter or lard for heart-healthy fats like olive oil or avocado oil.\n\n\"We're not necessarily changing the food, we're just changing how we're sometimes preparing it,\" he said.\n\nAnimal products and full-fat dairy products like beef tallow, butter, and cream contain saturated fat, which can drive up our LDL or \"bad cholesterol levels, Landry said. If a person has too much LDL cholesterol in their blood, it can form a sticky plaque in their arteries, putting them at greater risk of heart disease.\n\nWe need fat as part of a balanced diet, but unsaturated fats, found in foods such as avocados, fatty fish, nuts, and olive oil, don't raise our LDL cholesterol nearly as much as saturated fat, he said.\n\nThere's one finding that keeps cropping up in Landry's research: reducing red meat consumption lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nLandry worked on a 2023 study in which 22 pairs of identical twins were assigned either a vegan or an omnivorous diet for eight weeks. It was the focus of a Netflix documentary titled \"You Are What You Eat: A Twin Experiment.\"\n\nThis doesn't mean you have to cut out meat entirely, Landry said, but he recommended swapping red and processed meats, including beef, pork, and sausages, for leaner options like poultry, such as chicken and turkey, or fish, which are lower in saturated fat.\n\nIt's also a good idea to add plant-based protein sources to your diet. \"Eventually, I would love for folks to even move further than that and start consuming some plant-based proteins, some beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh. Those are great things for our heart as well,\" he said.\n\nFiber is great at keeping cholesterol levels \"nice and stable,\" Landry said, but most Americans don't eat enough. Ninety percent of women, and 97% of men, don't meet the recommended 30 grams of fiber a day, according to the 2020 to 2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The 2025 to 2030 guidelines recommend two to four servings of whole grains a day.\n\nWhole grains such as brown rice, quinoa, and whole-wheat bread are good sources of fiber and can easily replace their white counterparts, which tend to be low in fiber. One cup of brown rice, for example, contains 3.5 grams of fiber, while a cup of white rice contains 0.6 grams.\n\n\"We can still have bread, we can still have rice,\" Landry, said, \"but the whole grain version.\"",

    "description": "Career coach Andrea Wasserman stresses how important it is to resist the urge to \"wait and see.\" Get started now preparing for career advancement.",
    "fullText": "It's a misconception that promotions are decided late in the year. If you want to end 2026 with a bigger title, the time to lay your foundation is now. By the time the year-end performance review cycle starts, leaders already have a strong impression of who's operating at the next level and who isn't.\n\nThroughout my career, leading large teams at companies like Verizon and Yahoo, and now providing career coaching to ambitious leaders, I've seen the same pattern repeat itself: The people who advance don't wait all year for certainty, perfect conditions, or formal feedback cycles. They use the beginning of the year to strategically position themselves.\n\nThis doesn't mean demanding a promotion immediately, or raising your expectations at the wrong time. It does mean being intentional, thoughtful, and proactive.\n\nHere are seven actions that consistently put employees on a promotion path before most of their peers even realize the race has started.\n\nMany employees start January focused on their own goals. Speaking that way too often can make you seem myopic or even selfish. High performers start by understanding the company's goals and establishing how they'll support them.\n\nPay attention to leadership messaging, annual priorities, earnings calls, kickoff meetings, and how success is being defined at the top and by your own manager. Promotions rarely come from doing your job well in a silo. They come from delivering results that matter in the current business context and are important to the success of your leaders.\n\nEarly in the year, take the time to connect your role to those priorities and people. Be explicit with your manager about how your work ladders up, listen, and adjust where needed. People who align early are far more likely to be seen as strategic rather than reactive.\n\nMany employees assume strong performance speaks for itself. It doesn't. More importantly, what you consider a strong performance may not be the performance your manager wants to see from you this year.\n\nWhat matters is how performance is measured, discussed, and compared. January is the right time to ask clarifying questions about expectations, scope, and what \"excellent\" actually means in practice.\n\nThis doesn't mean asking for a promotion conversation immediately. It means understanding what leaders value when they're making promotion decisions so you can focus your energy accordingly. Employees who do this early avoid spending months excelling at work that doesn't meaningfully factor into advancement decisions.\n\nEmployees who get promoted rarely wait for formal check-ins to surface progress or concerns. They manage the narrative throughout the year and consistently demonstrate a commitment to the business and the team.\n\nThat can be as simple as sharing brief updates, flagging wins in real time, and articulating challenges (and, ideally, solutions) before they escalate. January is the right moment to establish this cadence, when habits are still being formed and expectations are being reset.\n\nLeaders notice which team members make their jobs easier, and which ones are catalysts for confusion and drama. Clear, timely communication builds trust and positions you as someone who operates independently, reduces friction for everyone, and thinks ahead. That makes you promotable.\n\nPromotions often require the support of multiple people. Yet many employees stay narrowly focused on their immediate manager. While leading with influence is always important, it's especially critical during this time. Building advocates in other parts of your organization, with both peers and more senior leaders, takes time. Start now.\n\nEarly in the year, look for opportunities to collaborate across functions, contribute to shared initiatives, or support work that has a broader organizational impact. This isn't about overextending yourself. It's about choosing exposure deliberately and nurturing important alliances.\n\nOne of the fastest ways leaders assess readiness for promotion is by watching how employees respond to ambiguity. High-potential employees don't wait to be told exactly what to fix, let alone how to fix it. They notice gaps, raise their hand, and take responsibility for improving something that affects the business or the team.\n\nThis doesn't mean creating extra work for yourself indiscriminately. It means choosing one meaningful issue where you can add value, demonstrating sound judgment in how you approach it, and then communicating the results with transparency.\n\nDon't expect to be immediately rewarded for your efforts just because you took on work that isn't in your job description. Consider the contribution as an investment in your longer-term career growth.\n\nI've seen too many employees wait until performance review season to assess their work and reflect on their accomplishments. By then, details are a distant memory, and momentum is lost.\n\nStart tracking your impact in real time, especially early wins. Aim to do this weekly, so your work is fresh in your mind. Capture feedback, metrics, and examples that show progress over time.\n\nYou don't need a fancy system for this. Just pick a record-keeping method that works for you and stick to it.\n\nThis habit makes performance conversations easier and more grounded in reality than if you're belatedly trying to recall a year's worth of action all at once. It also forces you to stay focused on results rather than effort and to recalibrate if you're finding yourself very busy, yet not producing in the ways you know will matter.\n\nJanuary often brings a sense that it's too early to push, ask, or assert oneself. In reality, that hesitation can cost you months of opportunity. Just remember there's a balance: While you have every right to understand expectations and express your aspirations, avoid creating a perception that you're impatient or overly focused on yourself.\n\nThe employees who move ahead don't rush, but they also don't sit back. They use the beginning of the year to set direction, establish credibility, and signal how they intend to operate.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nMeredith Whitney earned her “Oracle of Wall Street” nickname by predicting the 2008 financial crisis before it hit. Now, nearly two decades later, she sees fresh trouble brewing — this time, in the U.S. housing market.\n\n“The housing market is gummed up with existing home sales on track in 2025 to be their slowest in more than 25 years,” Whitney wrote in a piece for the Financial Times (1). “The next few years may not be much better.”\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nGet early access to privately-held AI companies with Fundrise Venture Capital for as little as $10. Join 350,000+ investors today\n\nThe problem is tied to demographic shifts. Whitney reports that over 54% of homes in the U.S. are owned by seniors — 10% more than in 2008. Most of them own their homes outright, meaning they’re mortgage-free. According to property brokerage platform Redfin, 78% of seniors want to remain in their current home rather than downsize (2).\n\nIn an interview with Marketwatch earlier this year, Whitney said, “Either these folks have no mortgage, or a small mortgage, and the capital gains that they have to take and the costs that are required to move are prohibitive (3).”\n\nHere’s how this is affecting boomers and America’s housing supply.\n\nWhitney added that the potential tax bite from selling your home means baby boomers may not be as wealthy as they think.\n\nAfter selling your primary residence, the IRS allows you to deduct up to $250,000 from the home’s selling price (or $500,000 for joint filers) to reduce your capital gains liability (4). Given that this threshold was set in 1997, it’s not nearly as helpful now as it was when home prices were far lower.\n\nWhitney is not the only one raising red flags.\n\nLast September, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said that the housing market is “in part frozen” with many homeowners reluctant to sell because they’re locked in at lower mortgage rates (5). These rates date back to the pandemic, which were between 0% and 0.25% according to Brookings (6).\n\nThe result? Persistently high prices combined with elevated interest rates, which can render homeownership harder than ever to achieve.\n\nAccording to Realtor.com, the typical U.S. household earned roughly 46% less than what’s recommended to afford a $439,950 home, which was the median list price for an American home as of July (7). In December, the median price of a home had dropped to $415,000, meaning that prices had improved — but not by much (8).",

    "description": "The criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell is likely to further complicate Donald Trump's timeline for naming his replacement.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's search to replace Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has taken a major turn in the new year.\n\nOn Sunday, Powell confirmed an explosive report that he is facing a criminal investigation related to his prior testimony to Congress about the $2.5 billion renovation to the Fed's headquarters.\n\nIn a video statement, Powell said that the probe was in retaliation for his decision to ignore Trump's wishes on rate cuts.\n\n\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said.\n\nTrump told NBC News that he had nothing to do with the grand jury subpoenas sent to the Fed, adding that Powell is \"certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings.\"\n\nNews of the probe has complicated Trump's path to replacing Powell, whose term ends in May.\n\nHere's where Trump's search stands and who is on top of his list.\n\nKevin Hassett, one of Trump's top economic advisors, has long been considered a likely pick to replace Powell.\n\nAs of January, Hassett is tied with Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, at 40% for the odds of being Trump's pick at both Kalshi and Polymarket.\n\nAsked about the criminal probe into Powell, Hassett said it made sense to investigate why the Fed's renovations overran their initial cost estimates. (The Fed has said costs went up due to changes in design, the increase in cost of materials, and unforeseen complications such as a larger amount of asbestos than anticipated.)\n\n\"I think that it's really important to understand where the taxpayer money goes, and understand why it goes this way or that,\" Hassett told reporters outside the White House on January 12.\n\nBefore joining Trump's orbit, Hassett advised a succession of Republican presidential nominees on economic policy, including George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, Hassett served as director of the president's Council of Economic Advisors. He returned to the White House during the COVID-19 pandemic and was severely criticized for publishing a model showing coronavirus deaths hitting zero by May 15, 2020.\n\nIn October 1999, Hassett cowrote with journalist Jason Glassman \"Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting From the Coming Rise in the Stock Market.\" Some economists have heavily criticized the book, largely because the index took more than 22 years to reach that threshold.\n\nTrump has long praised Warsh, the other Kevin on his shortlist to replace Powell.\n\nIn December, Trump told The Wall Street Journal that Warsh was at the top of his list.\n\n\"I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both—I think the two Kevins are great,\" he told the publication. \"I think there are a couple of other people that are great.\"\n\nMonths earlier, Trump told reporters that Hassett, Warsh, and current Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller were \"the top three.\"\n\nIn leading prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket, Warsh's odds surged in mid-December, then shrank, and are now trending higher once again.\n\nBack in his first term, Trump reportedly considered Warsh to lead the Fed before he chose to nominate Powell in 2017.\n\nWarsh spent his early years at Morgan Stanley, working as a specialist in mergers and acquisitions. President George W. Bush nominated him to the Fed in 2006 after Warsh served as an economic advisor in the Bush White House.\n\nDrawing on his Wall Street ties, Warsh played a pivotal role in the central bank's response to the 2008 global financial crisis. When he left the Fed in 2011, the Times called him the Fed's chief liaison to Wall Street.\n\nFrom the sidelines, Warsh has echoed Trump's criticism of Powell, calling for \"regime change\" at the Fed.\n\n\"The specter of the miss they made on inflation, it has stuck with them,\" Warsh told CNBC in July. \"So one of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy.\"\n\nFed Gov. Christopher Waller, who currently serves alongside Powell on the central bank, has previously said that he thought his interview went well.\n\nIn late November, Waller told Fox News he was pleased about his conversation with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led Trump's search process.\n\nIn mid-December, CNBC reported that unnamed senior administration officials said Waller had a \"strong interview\" with Trump himself.\n\nDespite optimism in the press, Waller's odds have collapsed in leading prediction markets. As of January, Waller is under 10% at both Kalshi and Polymarket.\n\nWaller, a longtime regional Fed official, was seen as a convention pick when Trump nominated him to the central bank in 2019. Simultaneously, Trump also nominated Judy Shelton, a former campaign advisor and a Fed critic. The fight over Shelton's nomination soon spilled over onto Waller's.\n\nIn December 2020, the Senate confirmed Waller 48-47, the narrowest margin for any Fed governor since 1980, per The New York Times.\n\nIn July, Waller joined Gov. Michelle Bowman (another Trump first-term pick) in opposing the Fed's decision not to cut interest rates, the first dual dissent in more than 30 years.\n\nThere's also a big Wall Street name on Trump's shortlist.\n\nRick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, has spent decades on Wall Street, dating back to his time at Lehman Brothers.\n\nRieder is responsible for managing roughly $2.4 trillion in assets, per BlackRock. He's served as a member of the Fed's Investment Advisory Committee on Financial Markets.\n\nFederal Reserve Gov. Michelle Bowman was once thought to be a potential contender, but hasn't received the same buzz as other hopefuls in recent months.\n\nIn 2018, Trump appointed Bowman to the central bank.\n\nAfter confirmation, she was reappointed in 2020. In June, she was narrowly confirmed as the vice chair of supervision.\n\nBowman started as an intern for Sen. Bob Dole. During the George W. Bush administration, she held posts at FEMA and the Homeland Security Department. She was vice president at Farmers and Drovers Bank in Kansas, her family's bank, before becoming the state's top banking official.\n\nIn September 2024, Bowman became the first Fed governor to vote against an interest rate decision since 2005. In July, she again voted against holding rates steady, though this time Waller joined her dissent.\n\nTrump's shortlist at one point reportedly had almost a dozen names.\n\nCNBC previously reported that the following are no longer under consideration: David Zervos, Managing Director and Chief Market Strategist at Jefferies; Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan; former St. Louis Fed President James \"Jim\" Bullard; Fed Gov. Philip Jefferson; and Marc Sumerlin, a former economic advisor to President George W. Bush.\n\nFormer Fed Gov. Larry Lindsey told CNBC that he withdrew from contention.",

    "fullText": "A picture is worth a thousand words. A video makes a statement.\n\nFacing down the threat of a potential criminal indictment, Fed Chair Jerome Powell didn't write a press release.\n\nInstead, he turned to the camera, literally, to respond to what he described as the Trump administration's \"threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\nThe choice was out of character for Powell, who's known for measured, not reactionary, responses during his Fed tenure. But the video enabled Powell to project calm while also signaling the significance of the moment, communication and leadership experts told BI's Ana Altcheck and Tim Paradis.\n\n(If you need a refresher, here's the backstory on Powell's Senate testimony that's the basis for the DOJ probe.)\n\nPowell's response is worth examining as President Donald Trump continues to pick fights across the business world. Look no further than the oil industry, where Trump said he's \"inclined\" to keep ExxonMobil out of Venezuela after its CEO said the country is currently \"uninvestable.\"\n\nIt's a strategy we've seen before from Trump.\n\n\"Trump will say he wants or needs something to happen, often using fantastical logic to justify it — and then uses coercion to try to make it happen,\" writes BI's Peter Kafka.\n\nIt's also part of a new form of capitalism that Trump is ushering in, including the government sometimes taking stakes in individual companies and leaning on public offices meant to remain independent. We're following it all this year with our series on \"The Future of Capitalism.\"\n\nEven if Trump wins the battle with Powell, he could still lose the war on rate cuts\n\nHeading into the year, investors expected two standard cuts from the central bank in 2026. Now JPMorgan is questioning if we'll even get one.\n\nStrong job and GDP growth, coupled with inflation sitting above 3%, has JPMorgan predicting the Fed will hold rates steady for the entire year. And that's even if Trump installs a Fed chair who's more keen to cut rates.\n\n\"Against this anticipated macro backdrop, we do not see the new dovish Fed chair being able to sway the FOMC to cut,\" wrote Michael Feroli, JPMorgan's chief US economist.\n\nAs if things couldn't get worse, Torsten Sløk, the chief economist at Apollo Global Management, has an even starker prediction: a rate hike.\n\nSløk said the massive amount of AI-led borrowing means companies issuing more bonds. The increase in investment-grade bonds could draw investors away from the Treasury market, potentially forcing rates higher.",

    "fullText": "The US stock market is heading for another big growth spurt.\n\nThat may seem hard to believe given how high stocks have climbed in the last three years, but the market is flashing a handful of signs it's headed for a new growth cycle characterized by a period of strong growth for asset prices and the economy, according to Andrew Sheets, the global head of fixed income research at Morgan Stanley.\n\n\"It's off to an eventful start, certainly, but we think that core message remains in place,\" Sheets said of the market outlook on a recent episode of the bank's \"Thoughts on the Market\" podcast. \"For now, we think they remain supporting evidence of our core view that this market cycle can still burn hotter before it burns out,\" he added.\n\nMorgan Stanley produced one of the most bullish 2026 stock forecasts on Wall Street, with strategists predicting the S&P 500 to climb 13%. The bank pinned its thesis to strong earnings growth and a continued \"rolling recovery\" in the economy, referring to its previous view that the US was in a \"rolling recession,\" or a downturn that appeared in different sectors at various times.\n\nSheets pointed to three signs that earnings and economic growth were on track to be stronger than investors were currently expecting. Here's what the bank is looking at:\n\nCopper has soared in recent months. It's a possible sign that the economic backdrop is looking favorable for the next year, Sheets suggested.\n\nThe metal was up around 44% over the course of 2025, marking its best year since the Great Financial Crisis.\n\nCopper has long been viewed as an economic bellwether, since demand for the metal is closely tied to industrial and manufacturing activity. Prices have risen in recent months, largely due to the imbalance of supply and demand, as well as the metal's expected use in data centers.\n\nAs much as US stocks went up in 2025, Korean stocks beat the rest of the market, another positive signal for global economic growth, Sheets said. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index soared 75% last year, outpacing the rest of the world and beating the S&P 500's 17% gain.\n\nStocks in Korea tend to be \"highly cyclical\" and are viewed as a \"proxy for global economic optimism, Sheets said. He also noted that small-cap stocks in the nation, which tend to be economically sensitive, have been outperforming large-cap stocks.\n\nFinancial stocks in the US and Europe have also been on a roll. That's another economically sensitive area of the market that can pave the way for higher growth, Sheets suggested.\n\nThe financial sector in the US was one of the best-performing areas of the market last year, with financial stocks in the S&P 500 gaining 14% in the last 1-year period, according to data from State Street Investment Management.\n\n\"These are different assets in different regions that all appear to be saying the same thing — that the outlook for global cyclical activity has been getting better and has now actually been doing so for some time,\" Sheets said.\n\n\"Now, any individual indicator can be wrong. But when multiple indicators all point in the same direction, that's pretty worthy of attention,\" he added.\n\nWall Street almost unanimously expects another strong year for stocks, thanks to expected catalysts like rate cuts, robust corporate earnings, and solid US economic growth. Morgan Stanley, RBC, and Deutsche Bank are among the big banks that think the S&P 500 will gain at least 10% in the coming year. beating its historic average.",

It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability. Chair Powell has served with integrity, focused on his mandate and an unwavering commitment to the public interest,\" the letter read.\n\nThe statement was signed by Christine Lagarde, head of the European Central Bank, and Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England chief, as well as central bank bosses from Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Australia, Canada, South Korea, and Brazil, alongside the chair and general managers of the Bank for International Settlements.\n\nThe letter comes after Powell revealed on Sunday that the Federal Reserve had been served grand jury subpoenas by the Department of Justice, which was widely viewed as the latest escalation in an ongoing dispute between the central bank and the Trump administration over the path of interest rates.\n\n\"No one — certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve — is above the law,\" Powell said in a video statement on Sunday. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\nOn Monday, a group of senior figures in US economics and monetary policy, including all three living former heads of the Fed, and five former Treasury secretaries, rallied behind Powell.\n\nThat statement called the investigation \"an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine\" the independence of the Fed.\n\n\"It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success,\" the statement added.",

    "fullText": "The soaring valuations of AI companies aren't just a bet on better software.\n\nThey're a wager on who will control human labor in the future, according to Roman Yampolskiy, a University of Louisville computer science professor who was one of the first academics to warn about AI's risks.\n\nAs artificial intelligence moves from tools to increasingly autonomous agents, Yampolskiy said markets are pricing in a radical shift: machines providing \"free labor\" at scale.\n\n\"You go from having tools to having agents with humanlike capability that really represents free labor,\" Yampolskiy told the UK's LBC radio station in a recent interview. \"Free labor — cognitive free labor, physical labor.\"\n\nThat dynamic, he said, helps explain why investors are willing to pay lofty valuations for AI companies even before many of them have established clear business models.\n\n\"If a company valuation is a hundred billion today, it's actually a small bet on having access to that free labor,\" he told LBC.\n\nIn comments later to Business Insider, he said that \"once a model is trained and deployed, copying its capabilities across millions of tasks is mostly compute, not salaries.\"\n\nMarkets, he added, tend to underestimate how abruptly change can arrive.\n\n\"When quality crosses a usability threshold, substitution can be abrupt,\" he said. \"Wage value can collapse faster than institutions can adapt.\"\n\nYampolskiy told LBC that any job performed entirely on a computer is vulnerable to automation; he offered up programming, accounting, tax preparation, and web design as examples.\n\nWhile automation may initially remove only the most tedious tasks, entire roles could disappear over time, he said.\n\n\"In five years, we'll have capability to automate all cognitive labor and a lot of physical labor,\" he said during the interview, pointing to rapid advances in robotics.\n\nWhat makes this technological wave different, Yampolskiy told Business Insider, is that AI targets \"the general substrate of cognitive work itself,\" rather than specific tasks.\n\nPast technologies have created new jobs that require uniquely human skills; this time, he said, the frontier keeps moving.\n\n\"The new categories become automatable shortly after they appear,\" he said.\n\nHe expects adoption to be slowed by regulation, liability, and organizational inertia — but ultimately driven by competitive pressure and cost-cutting.\n\n\"Firms adopt whatever lowers costs and increases speed once reliability is good enough,\" he said.\n\nYampolskiy, who has previously said AI could leave 99% of workers jobless by 2030, joins a growing chorus of AI experts and tech leaders predicting that the technology could wipe out vast swaths of work.\n\nGeoffrey Hinton, the computer scientist known as \"the godfather of AI,\" has said that AI could replace \"many, many jobs\" as early as 2026, while AI pioneer Stuart Russell has warned that societies may face up to 80% unemployment.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang and former Meta AI chief Yann LeCun have said AI will change jobs rather than eliminate them, while executives like JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Zoom's Eric Yuan have predicted the technology could reshape work and shorten the workweek instead of erasing employment.\n\nYampolskiy sees a bigger risk. Once societies become dependent on AI as critical infrastructure, he said, slowing down may no longer be a real option.\n\n\"Dependency creates lock-in,\" he told Business Insider.\n\n\"Once AI becomes critical infrastructure,\" he said, \"risk tolerance increases by necessity rather than choice. In that state, control failures become more likely precisely because the option to pause, audit, or roll back is no longer viable.\"",

    "description": "Walmart's entry into groceries, and supermarkets' reaction, sent some shoppers to Whole Foods, co-founder John Mackey said.",
    "fullText": "Early in its history, Whole Foods got some indirect help from an unlikely \n\nJohn Mackey, who cofounded Whole Foods in 1980, told podcast host David Senra in an episode released last week that Walmart's move into groceries in the late '80s helped the grocery chain find a wider audience.\n\nIn its early years, Whole Foods served a niche market of health-conscious shoppers. Its clientele was mostly \"a bunch of hippies selling food to other hippies,\" Mackey said, describing one venture capitalist's summation of the store.\n\nIn 1988, however, Walmart made a move that would send ripples through the US grocery industry: It opened its first Supercenter, which sold both the general merchandise that Walmart was known for at the time, as well as groceries, a category that put it in competition with traditional supermarkets for the first time.\n\nWalmart's focus on low prices sent many grocery chains scrambling to cut their own prices — and shed costs accordingly, Mackey told Senra during the episode.\n\nThe cuts came in multiple areas, he said. He saw grocers reduce spending on stores, making them resemble warehouses and illuminating them with harsh lighting. Many also \"cut their labor to the bone,\" which meant that customer service got worse, he said.\n\n\"All they wanted to do was figure out how to compete with Walmart,\" Mackey said.\n\nWhole Foods used a different strategy, he said. The chain played up its selection of health-focused products and customer service as an advantage, even if its prices weren't as low as Walmart. Whole Foods employees at the time would take customers' purchases to their cars, for example, he said.\n\nAll that helped the grocery chain appeal to upper-middle-class shoppers, especially women, who were looking for a better shopping experience than what they were increasingly finding at America's cost-conscious supermarkets, Mackey said.\n\nIt didn't matter that many of Whole Foods' products were foreign to these high-income shoppers or that many Whole Foods employees had tattoos or piercings, Mackey said.\n\n\"They wanted to come into a store that was pretty, that was beautiful, with people that gave them good service,\" he said.\n\nAttracting those shoppers allowed Whole Foods to grow its sales, Mackey said. \"We were not just in our own little Hippieville any longer, \" he said.\n\nOver the next couple of decades, Whole Foods opened new stores outside its home state of Texas and became a national grocery chain, largely ignored by many of its rivals, Mackey said. And while the chain earned the nickname \"Whole Paycheck\" for its high prices, it also became known for the affluent, liberal-leaning customers who frequented its stores.\n\n\"Walmart was this giant distraction, and we were running down the field wide open for the touchdown pass,\" he said.\n\nIn 2017, Amazon acquired the chain and has since cut prices on many items at Whole Foods as well as brought its Prime subscribers, many of whom are also middle-class shoppers willing to spend a little more on food, into the stores. Mackey, who served as CEO of Whole Foods from its founding, left the company in 2022.\n\nWhile Whole Foods found its niche in the grocery industry, it still remains a relatively small player in terms of market share. The chain commanded just under 2% of sales in March 2025, according to research firm Numerator. Walmart, meanwhile, took over one-fifth of sales in the US.",

    "title": "Now Ukrainian Drones Are Taking Out The Riders (But Not The Horses) Of Russian Cavalry, What Century Am I In?",
    "description": "In strict military terms, what the Russians are deploying are probably closer to dragoons than proper cavalry.",
    "fullText": "Coming into the year 2026, Ukrainian drone operators are getting better at taking out Russian horse cavalry, and yes that is a real sentence. Over the last few weeks, the invading army appears to be experimenting with new forms of assault, given that its advance has slowed to a crawl. Large-wave attacks were neutralized by NATO-made heavy artillery, and motorized transports have been torn apart by kamikaze drones and land mines. That led to individual soldiers trying to rush across no-man's land on foot, but drones made short work of them. What's left to try but returning to the 19th century?\n\nIn strict military terms, what the Russians are deploying are probably closer to dragoons than proper cavalry. As with earlier ATV assaults, this is just old-fashioned Russian infantry using a vehicle to move around quickly before jumping off and fighting on foot. It speaks volumes that they've gotten to this point: the invaders must be desperate for spare parts, forcing them to turn to animals. That's an indicator of general economic deterioration. However, as the Telegraph points out, horses are not made of metal, a tactical advantage against magnetic land mines.\n\nThat's not to say these horses aren't hi-tech! The Russians have outfitted their horses with Starlink terminals, and yes that is also a real sentence. The Kyiv Post reports soldiers throwing a rig together, including a dish and a console. As the article notes, SpaceX is supposedly not doing business with Russia, but workarounds grant the soldiers access. Russian military expert Samuel Bendett told Forbes that this all looks like ad hoc improvisation by individual units in the field, rather than a coordinated doctrine from Moscow.\n\nhttps://t.co/BeT9UQpCRopic.twitter.com/626A5HNKfM\n\n— OSINTtechnical (@Osinttechnical) December 26, 2025\n\nAs always, the actual horses don't have much say in the matter and don't know what's going on. The Ukrainians apparently didn't want to kill the quadrupedal conscripts, which required a change in tactics. Normally, the kamikaze drones would just dive-bomb the soldier on the vehicle, taking out both. To save the poor horse, operators now buzz the equine to spook it, throwing off the rider. The drone the circles back to strike the dismounted soldier. That's battlefield empathy for you. The video above shows an example.\n\nThe whole thing is an example of opposing forces experimenting and adapting to one another, something that Russia and Ukraine have been doing since the invasion began. Drone warfare in particular is being tested in this war, with new tactics popping up all the time. The U.S. military has taken note and is actively trying to pivot to smaller, cheaper platforms itself. As the world adapts to this new form of conflict, expect more innovations and counter-innovations to appear, both in technology and doctrine. Even satellite-equipped dragoons, apparently. When the infantry starts forming squares, you know it's getting dire.\n\nWant more like this?

    "fullText": "A former U.S. Navy sailor convicted of selling technical and operating manuals for ships and operating systems to an intelligence officer working for China was sentenced Monday to more than 16 years in prison, prosecutors said.\n\nA federal judge in San Diego sentenced Jinchao Wei, 25, to 200 months. A federal jury convicted Wei in August of six crimes, including espionage. He was paid more than $12,000 for the information he sold, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement.\n\nWei, an engineer for the amphibious assault ship USS Essex, was one of two California-based sailors charged on Aug. 3, 2023, with providing sensitive military information to China. The other, Wenheng Zhao, was sentenced to more than two years in 2024 after he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of receiving a bribe in violation of his official duties.\n\nU.S. officials have for years expressed concern about the espionage threat they say the Chinese government poses, bringing criminal cases in recent years against Beijing intelligence operatives who have stolen sensitive government and commercial information, including through illegal hacking.\n\nWei was recruited via social media in 2022 by an intelligence officer who portrayed himself as a naval enthusiast working for the state-owned China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, prosecutors said.\n\nEvidence presented in court showed Wei told a friend that the person was “extremely suspicious” and that it was “quite obviously” espionage. Wei disregarded the friend's advice to delete the contact and instead moved conversations with the intelligence officer to a different encrypted messaging app Wei believed was more secure, prosecutors said.\n\nOver the course of 18 months, Wei sent the officer photos and videos of the Essex, advised him of the location of various Navy ships and told him about the Essex's defensive weapons, prosecutors said.\n\nWei sold the intelligence officer 60 technical and operating manuals, including those for weapons control, aircraft and deck elevators. The manuals contained export control warnings and detailed the operations of multiple systems aboard the Essex and similar ships.\n\nHe was a petty officer second class, which is a enlisted sailor's rank.\n\nThe Navy's website says the Essex is equipped to transport and support a Marine Corps landing force of over 2,000 troops during an air and amphibious assault.\n\nIn a letter to the judge before sentencing, Wei apologized and said he shouldn’t have shared anything with the person who he had considered a friend. Wei said “introversion and loneliness” clouded his judgment.",

    "description": "For 80 years, scientists have been aware of “equatorial waters” in the Pacific and Indian oceans. Finally, similar waters in the Atlantic have been found.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nFor decades, scientists have known about “equatorial waters”—masses of ocean that separate waters north and south of the equator—in both the Pacific and Indian oceans. But a similar mass in the Atlantic has long remained elusive.\n\nA study by The Shirshov Institute of Oceanology finally discovered this aquatic mass, known as the Atlantic Equatorial Water (AEW), by poring over data available through the international Argo program.\n\nUnderstanding this water mass—as well as others—will help scientists grasp how the world’s oceans transfer heat and nutrients across the planet.\n\nStare out into the grand expense of the ocean, and it can truly seem endless. Although oceans appear vast and uniform, they’re actually a mixture of roiling layers and masses both connected and split apart by various currents, temperature changes, and salinity variations.\n\nOne of these sections of ocean is what’s known as equatorial water, which forms along the equator and separates bodies to its north and south. For decades, scientists knew about equatorial waters in both the Pacific and Indian oceans—they had been detected through the collection of salinity and temperature data. However, a similar mass in the Atlantic remained ever elusive. This has been a particularly sticky problem for oceanologists, because it suggests that the Earth’s other equatorial oceans somehow behave differently than the Atlantic.\n\nFinally, scientists from The Shirshov Institute of Oceanology in Moscow say they’ve found the Atlantic Equatorial Water (AEW) by combing over data provided by Argo, an international program that gathers ocean data using robotic platforms. The results were published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.\n\n“In 1998 the Argo program was launched, [which] collects information from inside the ocean using a fleet of robotic instruments that drift with the ocean currents and move up and down between the surface and a mid-water level,” the paper reads. “Re-examination of water masses using previously unavailable high-quality large volume Argo data allowed us to distinguish a formerly unnoticed water mass in the main thermocline [transition layer between warm surface water and cooler deep water] of the Equatorial Atlantic and thereby complete the phenomenological pattern of basic water masses of the World Ocean.”\n\nUnderstanding these areas of the ocean, and knowing they exist in the first place, is incredibly important. The paper notes that these water masses can act as reservoirs of heat, salt, and dissolved gasses—all of which reflect climate variability. Studying AEW, as well as other oceanic masses, will also help scientists grasp how the mixing process transfers heat and oxygen around the globe, according to Live Science.\n\nThe ocean’s dizzying complexity—along with its notable inhospitality to human biology—is why experts say we know more about the surface of Mars than our own seas. But that sense of scientific murkiness just experienced a major moment of clarity.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Greenland’s leaders and residents have hit back at President Donald Trump’s takeover talk, saying they are tired of being treated like a prize to be claimed.\n\nGreenlandic MP Per Berthelsen told the Financial Times: “They are treating us as if we were merchandise in a shop. I have difficulties seeing the difference between the way the Americans are acting towards Greenland, and Russia, where you can see that the interest is to make their [territory] bigger.”\n\n“We are not for sale. We don’t want to be Americans, we want to be Greenlanders,” Berthelsen, a former Greenlandic foreign minister, told the Financial Times.\n\n“I don’t want to live in an American empire,” resident Maja Overgaard said in the same report, while fisherman Helte Johannsen dismissed Trump outright: “I don’t think that Trump knows anything about Greenland.”\n\nTrump has ramped up his threats to take over Greenland after the U.S. kidnapped Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro in an unprecedented military move, and said it would run the country during a transition period.\n\nDuring a press gaggle aboard Air Force One on Sunday, the president was asked whether he was still planning U.S. military action against Greenland, an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\n“If we don’t take Greenland, Russia or China will,” Trump said. “And I’m not letting that happen.”\n\nWhen asked if Greenland could “offer” him anything, he said, “Sure, I’d love to make a deal with them, that’s easier. But one way or the other, we’re gonna have Greenland.”\n\nTrump made a similar threat in a speech to Congress in March.\n\nOn Sunday, he clarified his approach: “Look, we’re talking about acquiring, not leasing, not having it short term. We’re talking about acquiring. And if we don’t do it, Russia or China will. And that’s not going to happen when I’m president.”\n\nHe repeated the threat Friday, telling reporters, “We are going to do something in Greenland, whether they like it or not,” and added he would “do it the hard way” if a deal could not be reached.\n\nDenmark and Greenland have consistently rejected the idea, warning that U.S. military action could threaten NATO and emphasizing that Greenland is not for sale.\n\nLast week, Greenland’s government and opposition issued a joint statement: “We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders. The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people.”\n\nGreenland, home to around 56,000 people mostly near Nuuk, is largely covered by ice but holds strategic and economic importance. Its location makes it vital to U.S. military early-warning systems, and melting ice has opened access to valuable resources, such as rare-earth minerals, drawing growing international interest.\n\n“It’s not fun being 56,000 people and having these threats—if you can call them that—from a giant like the US,” Masaana Egede, editor of Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq, told the BBC last week.\n\n“The citizens of Greenland are nervous about this, because this is not something that we take lightly.”\n\nA 2025 Verian poll showed that only 6 percent of Greenlanders are in favour of becoming part of the U.S., with 9 percent undecided.",

    "description": "“The dreaded mortgage rate ‘lock-in’ effect is fading,” said real estate investor and Reventure CEO Nick Gerli.",
    "fullText": "During the pandemic-era housing market, homebuyers enjoyed sub-3% rates, ushering in a wave of homebuying among younger generations. But in the following few years, the American Dream came crashing down as mortgage rates and home prices rose, and inflation and wage stagnation set in.\n\nThat meant more homeowners in the U.S. had sub-3% mortgage rates compared with today’s 6%-range rates, creating a lock-in effect in which current homeowners refused to let go of their low mortgage rates and sell their homes only to turn around and face a much higher mortgage rate.\n\nBut now there’s a crack in the lock-in effect: Real estate investor and Reventure CEO Nick Gerli recently said that as of the end of 2025, there are actually now more homeowners with mortgage rates higher than 6% than borrowers locked into sub-3% rates, ending one of the most generous eras for home financing in modern history.\n\n“Something big just happened in the U.S. Housing Market,” Gerli wrote in a Jan. 3 X post, referring to the change in share of homeowners with sub-3% mortgage rates. That means the “the dreaded Mortgage Rate ‘Lock-In’ Effect is fading.”\n\nDuring the lock-in effect period, millions of existing homeowners with ultra-low rates have been financially disincentivized to move or “trade up,” i.e., buy a more expensive or larger home, which made the number of homes for sale scarce for would-be homebuyers. This led to younger-generation bidding wars for a limited pool of starter homes and kept many locked out of the market. In fact, the average first-time homebuyer age skyrocketed to 40 in 2025, according to the National Association of Realtors, and the share of first-time home buyers plummeted to a record low of 21%.\n\n“The historically low share of first-time buyers underscores the real-world consequences of a housing market starved for affordable inventory,” Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist and vice president of research, said in a statement. “The share of first-time buyers in the market has contracted by 50% since 2007—right before the Great Recession.”\n\nBut that all could change, Gerli said, since fewer homeowners have the attractive sub-3% mortgage rate.\n\n“Since more existing owners have a higher rate, that means more have a payment and rate closer to ‘market,’” he explained, “which means there will be more incentive to sell – which is actually good news.” Gerli analyzed Q3 2025 data from Fannie Mae’s mortgage database .\n\nGerli’s analysis shows the share of mortgages with rates of 6% or higher has surged from about 7% in 2022 to roughly 20% by late 2025, overtaking the once‑dominant pool of pandemic‑era borrowers with sub-3 % rates. Those pandemic-era loans peaked at nearly 25% of all outstanding loans in 2021, the analysis shows, but that share has been steadily shrinking as new buyers take out higher‑cost loans and older-generation buyers move or refinance.​",

    "fullText": "Realising undercover police officers were waiting off court was the moment Oliver Anderson knew he had been rumbled.\n\nAnderson had just lost in the second round of an ATP Challenger tournament, but it was his previous match - a three-set comeback win - that sparked the attention of the authorities.\n\n\"Anyone who was watching that match would have instantly thought something was up,\" the Australian recalls.\n\nIn January 2016, Anderson won the Australian Open boys' singles title in front of a home crowd, demonstrating his potential in a field featuring future top-10 stars Stefanos Tsitsipas, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Alex de Minaur.\n\nNine months later, the Brisbane teenager was busted for throwing a set.\n\nA decade on, the 27-year-old - who has returned to the professional ranks after being ignited by a \"quarter-life crisis\" - is still uncomfortable talking in depth about the details.\n\n\"It all happened very quickly.

    "fullText": "A federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as President Donald Trump seeks to shut it down.\n\nAt the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns. He said it also did not provide sufficient reasoning for its change in position.\n\nRevolution Wind has received all of its federal permits and is nearly 90% complete to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut.\n\nTrump says his goal is to not let any “windmills” be built. Three energy developers are challenging the administration’s freeze of their offshore wind projects in the federal courts this week.\n\nDanish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor, and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued to ask the courts to vacate and set aside the administration’s Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted’s hearing was first on its Revolution Wind project. Orsted said it will soon resume construction to deliver affordable, reliable power to the Northeast.\n\nThe administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are “losers.” He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.\n\n“I’ve told my people we will not approve windmills,” Trump said. “Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.”\n\nThe Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country’s energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York’s attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.\n\nRevolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.\n\n“The law takes precedent over the political whims of one man, and we will continue to fight to make sure that remains the case,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.\n\nAt Monday's hearing, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a critical stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February.\n\nSchneider said they take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries.\n\n“We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government’s true motives here,\" Schneider said, citing Trump's comments from Friday.\n\nDepartment of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers.\n\nWork on the Revolution Wind project was previously paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, Judge Lamberth ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. Orsted is building it with Skyborn Renewables.\n\nWith four offshore wind projects still stalled, Hillary Bright, executive director of offshore wind advocacy group Turn Forward, said she's hopeful that they will prevail in court and that the administration will begin to understand \"the immense benefits that these nearly complete power sources can bring to our nation’s energy and national security.”\n\nEquinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind LLC, said the project faces “likely termination” if construction can’t resume by this Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday.\n\n“I would like to think that offshore wind is, and will continue to be, part of an all-of-the-above energy solution, which our country desperately needs,” said Molly Morris, Equinor’s senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind.\n\nDominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It’s asking a judge to block the order, calling it “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional. Its hearing is Friday.\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations. AP is solely responsible for all content.

    "description": "I've been dealing with 3am wake-ups for months. Two doctors just explained what's likely behind these nighttime wake-ups and how to stop them",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nPicture the scene: you climb into bed and drift off with ease… only to be wide awake again around 3am. This has been my reality for the last few months.\n\nI’m often then left wide awake in the middle of the night, heart racing and unable to fall back to sleep. I had to find out why this was happening, so I tracked down two sought-after sleep experts to give me some answers...\n\n“Although frustrating, waking up around 3-4am and being unable to fall back asleep is a common problem and may be more frequent in women,” explains behavioral sleep specialist Dr Carleara Weiss, PhD, MS, RN, a Sleep Science Advisor at Aeroflow Sleep. \n\nHere, Dr Weiss, along with Dr. William Lu, MD, a sleep medicine physician and Medical Director at digital sleep clinic Dreem Health, each explain the potential reasons behind these 3am wake ups, plus their advice on how to fall asleep quickly again.\n\nAs annoying as it is, I know that I’m certainly not alone in waking up at 3am or 4am most days. Being unable to stay asleep all night is a common problem, and there are many different reasons behind it. \n\n“Arousals during sleep can be attributed to various causes,” explains Dr Lu. “These range from underlying issues like hormonal changes due to aging or menopause, or specific sleep disorders such as insomnia or sleep apnea.\n\n\"Additionally, environmental factors and lifestyle choices play a significant role,” continues Dr Lu.\n\n“Simple elements like light exposure, noise levels, room temperature, consumption of caffeine or alcohol in the evening, and inconsistent bedtimes can all contribute to those frequent 3-4 am awakenings.”\n\nLet’s take a closer look at some of the most common reasons behind those 3am wake ups...\n\nUnderlying sleep issues can cause you to wake up at 3am. These include insomnia, a disorder characterized by problems falling and staying asleep, as well as waking up at night.\n\nThere’s also sleep apnea, characterized by interrupted breathing at night, and nocturia, the repeated need to urinate at night. Parasomnias, such as sleep walking or sleep talking, could also be to blame for your nighttime waking. \n\nIf you suspect that you could have an underlying sleep issue, speak to your doctor to get professional advice and to discuss treatment.\n\nDon’t underestimate how much of an impact noisy neighbors, snoring partners or a blinking light from a charging device can have on your ability to stay asleep all night too.\n\nBrushing up on your sleep hygiene, which means that your bedroom is optimally set up for sleep, is step one. That means ensuring all ambient light is blocked out, that your bedroom is the right temperature for sleeping, and it's quiet too. \n\nYour mattress can also cause you to wake up through the night, so it's worth investing in the best mattress for your body.\n\nInconsistent bedtimes, late night sugary snacks, caffeine and alcohol consumption can each interfere with an optimal sleep cycle, and ultimately your ability to stay asleep all night.\n\nYou might not think that your nightcap, afternoon cappuccino or heavy meal before bed affects your sleep (you have no trouble falling asleep, after all).\n\nHowever, if you’re partial to the above habits and wonder why you can’t sleep through the night, it’s worth reconsidering your choices.\n\nBoth the menopause and perimenopause, which is the stage leading up to menopause, cause fluctuations in hormone levels, which can impact both sleep quality and quantity for women aged 35 and over.\n\nMost notably, a drop in estrogen can make it difficult for women to regulate their temperature at night, which can lead to night sweats and hot flushes. (Investing in one of the best cooling mattresses can help with this.)\n\nA drop in progesterone further disrupts the ability to both fall and stay asleep, while elevated nighttime levels of cortisol can add to difficulties staying asleep and fuelling feelings of anxiety.\n\nStress and anxiety cause cortisol levels, the hormone responsible for making us feel alert during the day, to rise. Unsurprisingly, being in a heightened state of arousal makes it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. \n\n“Waking up with a racing mind, heightened alertness, or worry often signals sleep disturbances related to stress and anxiety,” explains Dr Lu. \n\nDing ding ding, we have a winner. Waking with a racing heart and a head full of whirring thoughts feels all-too familiar to me.\n\nIf that resonates with you too, Dr Lu and Dr Weiss share their tips to falling back to sleep when elevated stress levels have woken you up further down the page.\n\nFor me, my racing heart and quickened breathing indicates that my 3am wakes are caused by stress and anxiety.\n\nAs a woman in the 40+ age category, the underlying cause of this could be due to an increase in cortisol, the hormone responsible for our fight or flight response. \n\nDuring perimenopause, which is the reproductive life stage I'm likely in, rising cortisol levels are exacerbated by a drop in key hormones that are pivotal to sleep quality. These are estrogen and progesterone.\n\npeople suffering from anxiety and depression may have a heightened cortisol level or be sensitive to its rise, which may cause an early morning awakening\n\nRegardless of the root cause of my underlying anxiety, the result is the same — I’m left wide awake in the middle of the night.\n\nThis, explains Dr Weiss, is due to a Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR). “CAR is a natural surge of the hormone cortisol that happens within the first 30-45 minutes after waking,” she explains, noting that cortisol functions as an alarm clock, preparing our bodies for the day by boosting alertness, energy, and focus. \n\n“Although the peak in CAR occurs between 30-45 minutes after awakening, cortisol production begins to increase around 3am to 4am.\n\n\"Therefore, people suffering from sleep disorders, such as insomnia or OSA, or mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, may have a heightened cortisol level or be sensitive to its rise, which may cause an early morning awakening,” she explains.\n\nUnderlying sleep disorder or stress and anxiety — how can you tell what's keeping you awake at night? \"This is a critical question, because daytime symptoms may be similar,\" explains Dr Weiss, who recommends exploring the symptoms you're experiencing in addition to your 3am wake ups. \n\n\"For instance, daytime symptoms such as fatigue, brain fog, irritability, and lack of attention or concentration may be common for a person experiencing nighttime awakenings due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or stress and anxiety,\" continues the sleep apnea expert.\n\nHowever, those with OSA will experience different nighttime symptoms to someone with anxiety, such as loud snoring, a dry mouth and coughing.\n\n\"They may also have a sore throat and a dry mouth, and sometimes halitosis upon awakening, which does not apply to those experiencing stress and anxiety,\" explains Dr Weiss. \n\nIn addition to staying in tune with your symptoms, Dr Lu recommend thinking about thinking about what is happening in your day to day life. \"A recent history of stress in your daily life can further suggest that your nighttime awakenings are stress-related,\" he explains.\n\nIf elevated stress levels are the cause of your nighttime awakenings, both Dr Weiss and Dr Lu agree that the key to falling back to sleep is to regulate your sympathetic nervous system. \n\n\"This can be done by keeping lights low and not checking the time, and by slowing your breathing,\" advises Dr Lu. \"If you have a racing mind, counting breaths or silently naming objects can help as well.\"\n\nWhat's more, Dr Lu notes that it's important to attempt to lower levels of stress during the day, as well as keeping consistent bedtimes, earlier caffeine cutoffs, and regular movement, which can all lower elevated cortisol levels. \n\nWide awake at 3am? Here's some of our tried and tested methods to falling back to sleep:\n\nThe 4-7-8 breathing method was popularized by Dr. Andrew Weil, whose team call it a \"perfect, portable stress antidote.\" To practice the breathing method, you inhale for 4 second, hold the breath for 7 seconds and exhale for 8 seconds. \n\nYou can repeat this cycle a further 3-4 more times, noting how your nervous system begins to feel regulated and feeling of anxiety dissipate.\n\nOur sleep writer Ruth Jones swears by the 15 minute sleep rule when she's struggling to fall asleep. If after 15 minutes she hasn't fallen asleep, she gets up and does a low-stimulation activity, such as reading or stretching. \n\nThis is advice that I've taken on board when I wake up in the middle of the night. If, after a few minutes of doing something relaxing in a different room, I return back to bed once the feeling of anxiety has worn off. Usually, this is enough to help me fall back to sleep.\n\nAnother tried and tested technique to falling back to sleep when you're wide awake at night is the cognitive shuffling method. The sleep technique, developed by Canadian scientist, Dr. Luc P. Beaudoin, involves visualizing seemingly random objects and thoughts. \n\n'Shuffling' your stream of consciousness effectively switches off racing thoughts, which helps to break the cycle of rumination. If you need a steer on where to start, think only of objects beginning with one specific letter.\n\nFollow Tom's Guide on Google News and add us as a preferred source to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.",

    "fullText": "The Coast Guard said authorities were notified on Jan. 9 about a missing 68-year-old man who failed to return to his Airbnb in Puerto Rico\n\nThe man's daughter said her father went surfing the previous day in the vicinity of Surfer’s Beach\n\nHe was later found and rescued by a helicopter\n\nA 68-year-old man who went surfing in Puerto Rico and was reported missing after he failed to return was found alive over 30 hours later.\n\nIn a statement over the weekend, the Coast Guard said they first heard that the man was missing on Friday, Jan 9, after he failed to return to his Airbnb — by which point he'd already been missing for more than 24 hours.\n\nSpeaking with his daughter, officials were able to confirm that the man went surfing in the vicinity of Surfer’s Beach in Aguadilla at noon local time on Thursday, Jan 8, and had not been heard from since.\n\nWith assistance from other authorities, the maritime law enforcement agency said an MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter was dispatched from Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen to perform shoreline and offshore searches north of Aguadilla.\n\n“During their shoreline search, the helicopter crew spotted an individual matching the description of the missing surfer stranded on rocks outside Surfer’s Beach, next to a surfboard and attempting to signal the aircraft,” the Coast Guard said, explaining that “due to surrounding rocks, reefs, and sea conditions, the location was inaccessible by foot or boat.”\n\nThe Coast Guard later shared footage of the 68-year-old man, who appeared to be holding onto walking sticks, as he made his way to safety.\n\nHe was then placed in a stretcher and lifted up by the rescue chopper.\n\n“The aircrew conducted a flawless hoist operation and safely recovered the individual aboard the aircraft despite difficult nighttime conditions and low visibility,” the agency added.\n\nCapt. Robert Stiles, the deputy sector commander of Coast Guard Sector San Juan who coordinated the search and rescue mission, hailed the outcome in a press statement.\n\n“We activated the inter-agency search and rescue effort as soon as we received the information, especially after realizing that it had been more than 24 hours” Stiles said. “It was truly a team effort and I appreciate the responsiveness and professionalism of Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen, the Sector San Juan Command Center and our local emergency responders.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nStiles encouraged those entering the waters to have a plan, wear proper-life saving equipment, and to tell someone about they’re planning to do in advance.",

    "fullText": "ISLAMABAD/JAKARTA Jan 12 (Reuters) - Indonesia's defence minister met Pakistan's air force chief in Islamabad to discuss a potential deal that includes the sale of combat jets and killer drones to Jakarta, three security ​officials with knowledge of the meeting on Monday said.\n\nThe talks come as Pakistan's defence industry moves forward with a series of ‌defence procurement negotiations, including deals with Libya's National Army and Sudan's army, and looks to establish itself as a sizable regional player.\n\nOne source said the talks revolved around the ‌sale of JF-17 jets, a multi-role combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China, and drones designed for surveillance and striking targets. The other two sources said the talks were in an advanced stage and involved more than 40 JF-17 jets. One of them said Indonesia was also interested in Pakistan's Shahpar drones.\n\nThe sources did not share any discussions about delivery timelines and the number of years a proposed deal would span.\n\nBoth Indonesia's Defence Ministry and ⁠Pakistan's military confirmed the meeting between Indonesian Defence ‌Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin and Pakistan's Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu.\n\n\"The meeting focused on discussing general defence cooperation relations, including strategic dialogue, strengthening communication between defence institutions, and opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields in ‍the long term,\" defence ministry spokesperson Brigadier General Rico Ricardo Sirait told Reuters, adding the talks had not yet led to concrete decisions.\n\nThe Pakistani military confirmed the meeting in a statement and also said the defence minister met army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir for talks that \"focused on matters of mutual interest, evolving ​regional and global security dynamics, and exploration of avenues for enhancing bilateral defence cooperation\".\n\nINDONESIA REPLACING AGEING AIR FORCE FLEET\n\nOne additional security source with ‌knowledge of military procurement talks said Pakistan was discussing the sale of JF-17 Thunder jets, air defence systems, training for junior, mid-level, and senior Indonesian air force officials, and engineering staff.\n\n\"The Indonesia deal is in the pipeline,\" retired Air Marshal Asim Suleiman, who remains briefed on air force deals, told Reuters, adding that the number of JF-17 jets involved was close to 40.\n\nIndonesia's President Prabowo Subianto was in Pakistan last month for a two-day visit for talks on improving bilateral ties, including defence.\n\nIndonesia has put in a slew of orders for jets in the past few years, ⁠including 42 French Rafale jets worth $8.1 billion in 2022 and 48 KAAN fighter ​jets from Turkey last year to strengthen its air force and replace its ageing ​air force fleet.\n\nJakarta has also considered buying China's J-10 fighter jets and is in talks to purchase U.S.-made F-15EX jets.\n\nPAKISTAN'S RISING DEFENCE INDUSTRY\n\nInterest in the Pakistani military's weapons development programme has surged since its jets were deployed in a ‍short conflict with India last year.\n\nThe JF-17s ⁠have been at the centre of that growing attention, figuring in a deal with Azerbaijan and the $4 billion weapons pact with the Libyan National Army.\n\nPakistan is also eyeing a defence pact with Bangladesh that could include the Super Mushshak training jets and JF-17s, ⁠as ties improve with Dhaka.",

    "description": "Jan 13 - Video of a U.S. immigration agent fatally shooting a Minneapolis mother in her car on Wednesday has divided the nation, becoming a political Rorschach test that elicits",
    "fullText": "Jan 13 - Video of a U.S. immigration agent fatally shooting a Minneapolis mother in her car on Wednesday has divided the nation, becoming a political Rorschach test that elicits different verdicts depending on who views it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration have defended the agent and branded 37-year-old Renee Good a domestic terrorist. Local leaders and protesters across ​the country have condemned the shooting, saying the fact that Good turned her wheels away from the officer as she drove past him proved her peaceful intentions.\n\nSince the shooting last Wednesday, Reuters ‌has spoken to six Americans who voted for Trump in 2024 - part of a group of 20 whom Reuters has interviewed monthly since February - to better understand how they assess an incident caught on video that has been viewed by millions.\n\nEach of these half-dozen voters, ‌who vary in their assessments of Trump's immigration policy and overall performance, came away from the video with the same conclusion: The agent feared for his life and his decision to shoot Good was justifiable.\n\nTheir verdict mirrors that of the Trump administration. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters hours after the incident that Good had refused agents’ orders to move and then “proceeded to weaponize her vehicle.” Trump said on social media that the woman \"ran over the ICE Officer.\"\n\nMany Americans disagree. Tens of thousands of people marched through Minneapolis this weekend to decry the killing and the city's mayor, Jacob Frey, called the Trump administration's assessment \"bullshit.\" Frey said the video showed an \"agent recklessly using power that resulted ⁠in somebody dying, getting killed.\"\n\nBut the video left all six voters convinced that ‌the agent shot Good because he thought she was trying to kill him. All expressed sympathy for the stressful conditions under which ICE and other law enforcement officers work, and many blamed Democratic leaders for inflaming anti-ICE sentiment, thereby making agents fear attacks from members of the public.\n\nAmanda Taylor, 52, an insurance firm employee near Savannah, Georgia, ‍who considers herself \"always pro-police,\" said the agent was \"protecting the community and protecting himself\" when he fired at Good.\n\nTaylor, who voted for Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020 and has had mixed feelings about Trump's economic policies and governing style, said the moment in the video when Good defied agents' orders to stop her car showed the agent she was a potential public threat.\n\n\"If they're running from you, what else are they gonna do?\" she said.\n\nThe first videos to widely circulate showed two ​masked officers approaching Good's car, which was stopped at a perpendicular angle on a Minneapolis street. As one officer ordered Good out of the car and grabbed at her door handle, the car briefly reversed ‌and then began driving forward, turning to the right.\n\nAnother officer, since identified as Jonathan Ross, was positioned in front of her car on the left. He drew his gun and fired three times, with the last shots aimed through the driver's side window. How much contact the car made with the officer, who stayed on his feet, has been widely debated.\n\nSeveral other voters also argued that Good's own actions led to her death. \"When I saw the video only one word came to mind, and that is 'disrespectful': another person failed to respect the law,\" said Herman Sims, 66, a night operations manager for a trucking company in Dallas, Texas.\n\n\"We won't ever know what would have happened if she kept going. Would she have run over someone else in the street blocks away?\" Sims said.\n\nChad Hill, 50, a supervisor at a nuclear power plant near his home in northwestern Ohio, ⁠also said the ICE agent was \"100% correct\" to use deadly force against Good once she had ignored officers' orders to ​stop.\n\n\"Putting a vehicle in drive and moving it toward a law enforcement officer is the same as drawing and pointing a gun,\" ​Hill said. He added that the \"political landscape in liberal cities has demonized ICE agents\" for merely doing their jobs.\n\n\"There is no doubt in my mind it was self-defense,\" said Jon Webber, 45, a Walmart retail worker in Indiana who fully supports Trump's immigration crackdown. \"The moment she threw her car in [drive] and revved up, even if she was trying to ‍avoid the ICE agents, she came way too close.\"\n\nEven ⁠voters who had mixed feelings about the administration’s deportation drive felt the agent should not face legal consequences.\n\nDon Jernigan, 75, has previously told Reuters that some footage of ICE raids reminds him of Nazi Germany. But after viewing video of this incident, the Virginia Beach retiree said he thinks the ICE agent who shot Good should not be prosecuted, just retrained.\n\n\"When he was out of the way ⁠and she was beside him, yes, indeed, he shouldn't have shot at her,\" said Jernigan. \"But at that point, he didn't know. All he knew was somebody tried to kill him.\"\n\nAlthough Lou Nunez, 83, shares Jernigan's qualms about the aggressive tactics some ICE agents have ‌used during raids, he said he would not prosecute the one who shot Good. The Des Moines-based veteran said the officers \"work in a pressure-cooker situation\" and that the onus was on ‌Good to follow their orders.",

    "description": "With both of their futures up in the air, Aaron Rodgers had a lot to say about Mike Tomlin's job security on Monday night.",
    "fullText": "Aaron Rodgers calls out 'Twitter experts' during passionate defense of Steelers coach Mike Tomlin originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nArguably two most important positions in football are up in the air for the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nNot only could quarterback Aaron Rodgers be heading for retirement this offseason, leaving the Steelers without a plan at the position, but head coach Mike Tomlin has been speculated as a candidate to part ways with the team after nearly two decades. After Monday's 30-6 playoff loss to the Houston Texans, the next questions for Pittsburgh revolve around Rodgers and Tomlin.\n\nIn Rodgers' opinion, however, there should be no questions over Tomlin's job security with the Steelers. The veteran quarterback spoke at-length in his postgame press conference on Monday about how silly he found it that Tomlin, one of the best coaches in NFL history, would be on the \"hot seat.\"\n\nHere's what Rodgers had to say about Mike Tomlin potentially being fired by the Steelers.\n\nWhat Aaron Rodgers said about potential NFL retirement\n\n3 reasons why Aaron Rodgers should come back for 2026 season\n\nRodgers is typically a hot commodity at his press conferences, and for many reasons, his postgame presser after Monday's playoff loss may have been his most important of the 2025 season. The question many fans wanted to know, of course, was if he'd be returning to the NFL in 2026.\n\nRodgers, however, said \"I'm not gonna talk about that.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to make any emotional decisions,\" Rodgers said. \"I'm disappointed. It was such a fun year. Lot of adversity, but a lot of fun.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to make any emotional decisions.\"\n\n–Aaron Rodgers when asked about his future. pic.twitter.com/3gU7HNNVC1\n\n— ESPN (@espn) January 13, 2026\n\nWhile Rodgers didn't have a lot to say about his own future, he did have a lot to say about Mike Tomlin's future in Pittsburgh.\n\nMORE: Will Aaron Rodgers retire?\n\nPostgame on Monday, Rodgers was asked about Tomlin, who hasn't led the Steelers to a playoff win since 2016 despite six postseason trips since then. Despite rumors that Pittsburgh could choose to part ways with its longtime coach, Rodgers wasn't buying it.\n\nIn a lengthy rant about how opinions from media and \"Twitter experts\" have affected the coach's job security, Rodgers said he disagrees with the idea that teams should move on from good coaches just because of outside pressure.\n\n\"This league has changed a lot in 21 years. When you hear conversations about the 'Mike Tomlins' of the world, the 'Matt LaFleurs' of the world, those are just two that I played for. And when I first got in the league, there wouldn't be conversations about whether those guys were on the 'hot seat,'\" Rodgers said. \"But the way that the league is covered now, and the way that there's snap decisions, and a validity given to the 'Twitter experts' and all the experts on TV now ... to me that's an absolute joke.\"\n\n\"Mike T. has had more success than damn-near everybody in the league for the last 19, 20 years. More than that, when you have the right guy, and the culture is right, you don't think about making a change. But there's a lot of pressure that comes from the outside, and obviously that sways decisions from time-to-time. But it's not how I would do things, and not how they used to be.\"\n\nAaron Rodgers, when asked about Mike Tomlin, speaks on Tomlin and on #Packers head coach Matt LaFleur after the @Steelers’ playoff loss: pic.twitter.com/gTNmgQT6Qw\n\n— Jason Wilde (@jasonjwilde) January 13, 2026\n\nRodgers was then asked another Tomlin-related question after that, and he didn't respond well.\n\n\"I’ve talked extensively about how I feel about Mike. And I just did in that f****** answer. Thanks,\" Rodgers said before walking away from the podium.\n\nAfter giving a lengthy answer in support of Mike Tomlin, Aaron Rodgers was asked another Tomlin question…\n\n“I’ve talked extensively about how I feel about Mike … and I just did in that fu**ing answer.”\n\nAnd bye. ✌️ pic.twitter.com/u7hIwzWuea\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) January 13, 2026\n\nTexans defense stifles Aaron Rodgers, Steelers in wild-card win\n\nWill Mike Tomlin, Steelers part ways after another first-round playoff exit?\n\nHow Steelers failed to take advantage of C.J.

    "description": "The refrain on Brian Rolapp from NFL insiders was: smart, good business sense, not a golf guy.",
    "fullText": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - A guess is that Brian Rolapp, the newish PGA Tour CEO, will be at the SoFi Center up the road from here Tuesday night, when Tiger Woods's TGL team takes on Steve Cohen's other New York team in the second week of the second season of the made-for-TV golf league. He was on hand last week, for the season opener. Does it matter that this is indoor, nighttime golf, a game that has been played outdoors by day for centuries? It does not. Rolapp has his eye on the real prize: In the first week, about 700,000 live viewers watched on ESPN and its broadcast cousins. Decent. Maybe the second week will be better.\n\nCome Wednesday night, Rolapp will likely be at The Breakers, the gilded five-star hotel across the intracoastal waterway from here, for a Tiger Woods birthday bash for 300. If he knows anything about Woods, he knows this kind of event is torture for him, but Woods will be there, a smile on his face, raising money for his philanthropy, the TGR Foundation. If it's important to Woods, it's important to Rolapp. Woods is a member of the PGA Tour policy board, the Tour's Enterprise Board (the for-profit arm) and the chairman of the Tour's Future Competition Committee. In addressing these matters and more - the Genesis Invitational, the Hero World Challenge - Rolapp and Woods will be the greatest Zoom buddies. Does it matter if he could not tell Chris Como from Matt Killen, to cite two of Woods's instructors from recent years? It does not.\n\nA longish preamble to a tea-leaf read of what's going on here, in this whole path-back-to-the-Tour thing, with Brian Rolapp's name and likeness all over it. When Rolapp was named the PGA Tour's new CEO, shortly after last year's U.S. Open, the refrain among people who knew him from the NFL was this: Smart, good business sense, not a golf guy. Turns out that last part, originally meant as a dis, is actually an asset (depending on your view of Monday's news). Brian Rolapp's most significant task is to get people to watch PGA Tour events, in person and, much more significantly, on any screen of their choosing. If getting Brooks Koepka back in the fold is going to help Rolapp in this cause, then he's going to do anything he can to get him back in the fold. There's no reason for him to worry about how Koepka took the LIV Golf money when he could, how he hurt the PGA Tour by leaving, how annoyed rank-and-file players will be by this easy path back. He wants the eyeballs that Koepka will bring. Full stop.\n\nIn his effort to bring back Bryson DeChambeau and Jon Rahm (both U.S. Open winners) and Cameron Smith (winner of both the '22 Players Championship and Open Championship), the same logic will apply.\n\nWhatever happened, happened. We want 'em back.\n\nMonday's news is the opening salvo. Rolapp said in August that his goal is not \"incremental change. It's significant change.\" This is, really, the antithesis of how Augusta National and the Masters works, where the leaders there despise the word change and take all their direction from the word improvement. Golf doesn't have a tradition of \"significant change.\" Rolapp might not know and surely does not care.\n\nWhen the LIV-Tour war first heated up in the summer of ‘22, Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner, said, \"I am not naive; if this is an arms race and if the only weapons here are dollar bills, the PGA Tour can’t compete.\" That sounded deeply true at the time. Rolapp is here to tell you: Dollar bills are not the only weapons in the LIV-PGA Tour battle. The PGA Tour offers something LIV Golf does not and that is the freedom to make your own schedule. The door to Koepka's return began with that.\n\nAs Rolapp tries to find a path back to the PGA Tour for Bryson DeChambeau and Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith, the same logic will apply. DeChambeau has flourished under LIV and has some bad PGA Tour memories. With Smith, it's hard to know what he cares about. Rahm could be open to the play-where-you-want argument. But he'd have to leave a mountain pile of Saudi money to do it.\n\nIt's hard to imagine the Saudis just walking away from LIV Golf. Walking away is not in their cultural business makeup. They're too rich and too smart and too ambitious. But Rolapp is going to do everything he can here to weaken LIV Golf. Working with Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy and a few other key figures, he will surely pave some kind of narrow path back to the PGA Tour for Talor Gooch, Tyrrell Hatton and Joaquin Niemann and a very few other LIV players who have won on the PGA Tour.\n\nAs for Sergio Garcia, Dustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson and Patrick Reed, all winners of major events, I'm guessing Rolapp has less interest in them or he would have expanded the terms in Monday's news. Mickelson is 55 and he has expressed such disdain for the PGA Tour it's hard to imagine him coming back. Woods has never been fond of Sergio Garcia so it's not likely he pushed Rolapp to make it easy for him to return. Patrick Reed's rules debacles made him a PGA Tour outsider. As for Dustin Johnson, whoever knows with him? He can play in the Masters forever. His father-in-law is Wayne Gretzky. He has all the jet skis he needs.\n\nRolapp cannot kill LIV Golf, as the NFL helped kill off the USFL in 1986. But he can weaken it. He can diminish its star power and the appeal of the international series for emerging golf talent. If he can weaken it enough, then LIV Golf and the PGA Tour might be able to some kind of meeting of the minds, where the two leagues co-exist.\n\nIn the meantime, the CEO of the PGA Tour is screaming his unspoken message: I don't care about what happened. I want to fix what's broken now.\n\nMichael Bamberger welcomes your comments at Michael.Bamberger@Golf.com\n\nThe post What Brooks Koepka coup reveals about PGA Tour’s new leader appeared first on Golf.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City take on Newcastle United tonight at St. James Park in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final tie. Given how formidable Eddie Howe’s side can be to face in front of their passionate home support, a tough match awaits Pep Guardiola’s side. City were beaten 2-1 by Newcastle at St. James Park earlier this season and will know the size of the challenge that awaits them tonight. If they can put in a good performance tonight it can set them up for the second leg of the tie which takes place on the February 4 at the Etihad.\n\nHere is the latest City injury news and my predicted City starting eleven ahead of tonight’s match.\n\nOnce again, Manchester City have a plethora of players unavailable due to injury and international duty. Omar Marmoush is unavailable as Egypt’s AFCON journey continues. John Stones, Ruben Dias, Josko Gvardiol, Mateo Kovacic, Oscar Bobb and Savinho will all miss tonight’s match due to injury.\n\nIn good news for Pep Guardiola’s side, Rayan Ait-Nouri has returned from AFCON duty following Algeria’s exit from the tournament. It remains unclear if Ait-Nouri will feature tonight as per Pep Guardiola’s update on the condition of his squad yesterday.\n\nJames Trafford: Pep Guardiola informed the media yesterday that Trafford will start in goal for tonight’s match. A big night awaits Trafford as if he can play well it could be crucial in tonight’s result.\n\nMatheus Nunes: Nunes was rested against Exeter City and with the pace that Newcastle have up front I expect him to start at right-back.\n\nMax Alleyne: Alleyne has been superb since returning from Watford. I believe he will start at centre-back tonight and he deserves to based on form.\n\nAbdukodir Khusanov: Tonight seems made for Khusanov.

He played in his first AFC playoff game with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2026, facing the Houston Texans in a wild-card game.\n\nRodgers was trying to help the Steelers get their first playoff win in nine seasons and end a five-game postseason losing streak, but came up short in a 30-6 loss. Rodgers last won a playoff game with the Green Bay Packers in 2021,\n\nHe has played at a high level overall in past playoff years, despite a lot of disappointment with some high-seeded favored teams.

Writing on social media, the 21-year-old said, “After 14 years my time at Manchester United has come to an end.\n\n“I would like to thank all the staff and players who have helped me become the person and player I am today.\n\n“I will always be grateful for my time here and wish the club all the best. On a personal note it’s time for me to move forward and I can’t wait to get started!”\n\nHe had clearly outgrown academy football, and played only six times for the U21s this campaign, registering two assists.\n\nThe Salford-born ace was called up to senior training this season, but he knew no chances would be coming under Ruben Amorim, and hence he decided to jump ship.\n\nThe club are yet to announce his departure, and there is no clarity on the fee nor on whether the 20-time English league champions included a sell-on clause and buyback clause.\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Following two back-to-back losses, rumors were circling that Sean O’ Malley is nearing his final fight. With UFC 324 just around the corner, ‘Suga’ has taken a firm stance on his retirement plans.\n\nWell, the conversation has spilled over to the extent of labelling UFC 324 against Song Yadong as his last career fight. The bantamweight has cleared up those online rumors, appearing on the Death Row MMA podcast.\n\n“I’m trying to just, you know, do it as long as I can until the wheels fall off or until I’m just f***king over it,” a decisive O’Malley told Jorge Masvidal, who was equally dumbfounded at the rumors. “Those are just rumors. I forget. I saw Chael made a video about me. What did I… My guy’s right here… What did I say about retiring? Why is that getting going everywhere? I said something, right? Like in a pod.”\n\nThe rumors first came to light after ‘Suga’ made a casual commentary in his podcast about never fighting again after two heartbreaking fights against Merab Dvalishvili, where he lost both his bouts to UD and submission. A remark he didn’t give much thought to at the time sparked retirement rumors, which faded away with the news of his UFC 324 bout.\n\nHowever, in another recent episode of his podcast, O’Malley clearly showed signs of exhaustion from his repetitive losses, reiterating similar concerns of hanging up his gloves. Even Chael Sonnen jumped on the bandwagon as he covered the issue on his podcast. But it’s important to take his words with a grain of salt, as O’Malley himself clarified.\n\n“There’s no plan. It was just kind of, I feel like I’ll know when it’s time, it’s time. I’m good. Yeah, we’ll see. I’m literally going to take it one fight at a time. One fight at a time,” O’Malley revealed his UFC plans, a sentiment similar to Justin Gaethje, who is on the verge of his retirement.\n\nIn fact, echoing previous claims on his UFC career, Sean O’Malley treats every fight with gravity, moving on to the next thing only once one bout is done and dusted. O’Malley doesn’t have an elaborate 3-5 fight contract in sight, with a good outcome motivating him to push forward, while a bad outcome can equally convince him to step back.\n\nWith that in mind, O’Malley has redirected his focus to the Yadong bout, which he knows won’t be an easy one. “I’m not looking past Song. I understand how dangerous Song is. He’s very good. He’s explosive, and this is not an easy fight by any means,” he added.\n\nHowever, he feels like fighting Petr Yan and the UFC White House event is very much in the cards, even though he finds himself less deserving of the title shot. “If you’re going off what makes the absolute most sense. Which isn’t always what the UFC goes off of. I think Merab deserves a title shot,” he told Masvidal.\n\nWhile his retirement hangs in the balance, O’Malley seems more than eager to expand his horizons to other disciplines, quite the opposite of the stifling retirement talks.\n\nWhen Masvidal steered the conversation to whether Sean O’Malley would like to compete in pro boxing, the bantamweight enthusiastically added, “I’ve always pictured myself getting a big boxing fight.” While O’Malley is focused on his UFC career at the moment, it doesn’t diminish the chances of a future bout.\n\nSpeaking up on his dream matchup, O’Malley told Masvidal, “I would say, in a perfect world, I’d be able to go out there and fight some young… Some 1-0, maybe 3-0, 5-0 pros, build my way up. But if I’m just thinking like me versus a big fight, I think me versus Gervonta Davis is one of the bigger fights that would be a big deal. That’s one fight that I think would be huge.”\n\nAt 31, every step needs to be intentional, but ‘Suga’ isn’t one to back down from a challenge, sharing how staying in shape could push his retirement years farther back. For now, Sean O’Malley isn’t closing any doors. Whether it’s chasing legacy-defining matchups or testing himself in entirely new arenas. Would you like to see ‘Suga’ inside the ring?\n\nThe post Sean O’Malley Doubles Down on Retirement Stance After UFC White House Event appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "fullText": "Offensive line is considered one of the toughest—and most expensive—positions to acquire from the NCAA transfer portal. Last offseason Arizona added seven linemen from the portal, and three ended up combining to start 34 games despite not being among the top 30 transfers at their position.\n\nAnd one of those starters, Tristan Bounds, had hardly seen the field in four years at Michigan before starting eight times at right tackle for the Wildcats.\n\nThe UA could be hoping for a similar story with ex-BYU offensive tackle Jake Griffin, who committed on Monday. He’s the third offensive lineman Arizona has gotten in this portal cycle, but unlike the other two has no starting experience.\n\nThe 6-foot-5, 305-pound Griffin will have two seasons of eligibility after spending three years at BYU. He’ll be among the oldest players on the UA roster as he graduated in 2020 and took a 2-year LDS mission before starting his college career.\n\nGriffin did not play his first two seasons with the Cougars but this past fall appeared in 11 games, mostly on special teams including six at Arizona. He got on the field with the offense for 27 snaps at both left and right tackle.\n\nThe UA has to replace both starting tackles and one of the other portal additions (San Jose State transfer Nate Hale) started 10 games at RT in 2025.\n\nGriffin is the older brother of fellow Wildcat offensive lineman Jaxon Griffin, a 3-star prospect from the 2025 recruiting class who redshirted this season. That will give Arizona three sets of brothers on the roster in 2026, joining quarterback Noah Fifita and incoming freshman linebacker Dash Fifita as well as receiver Tre Spivey and recent cornerback commit Kingston Spivey.\n\nArizona is now up to 18 known transfer commits, with nine on offense.",

    "description": "Fed up with the WNBA’s limits, Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier didn’t wait for change. In 2023, they created their own rules with the creation of Unrivaled.",
    "fullText": "Fed up with the WNBA’s limits, Breanna Stewart and Napheesa Collier didn’t wait for change. In 2023, they created their own rules with the creation of Unrivaled. It is intended to be a 3 vs 3 offseason league catered to the players. They offered much higher salaries than the WNBA, a stake (for first-year players), and better conditions than playing overseas, while also providing a fast-paced 3×3 game format. Season 1 was a great success, and they are only perfecting the format in the second season.\n\n“The last game I was warming up, and I was like, can you believe we did back-to-backs last year?” Breanna Stewart said on the TNT broadcast. In its inaugural season with 6 teams, they played only 3 nights per week, with a total of 15 back-to-back games happening over the course of the year. This season, they expanded to 8 teams with the addition of Breeze and Hive, but eliminated the back-to-backs as well. Instead, they are now playing 4 nights a week to accommodate the new teams. It’s a decision Stewart thinks plays a vital role in player welfare.\n\n“Just the ability to know that you’re able to compete, give your all, and you have a day in between your next game is incredibly important because back-to-backs are tough, and we have more than one of them throughout the season,” She said. “It wears on your body, and here we’re able to have a good flow just from a week standpoint, where you get your work in individually, get your work in as a team, and then you go play.”\n\nBack-to-back games have been a contentious point in basketball for years now. That is not limited to the WNBA, NBA, or even the international leagues, where the players have to endure tough schedules. If these players had to go outside the US, as they used to before Unrivaled, they would face the wrath of back-to-back games. On returning, they would be thrown in the condensed WNBA, which already had an adverse impact last year.\n\nWhen the WNBA upped the schedule to 44 games, it kept the season length the same as earlier. That naturally increased the density of games. To make matters worse, the scheduling was disoriented. Some teams played 2 or 3 back-to-backs, but the Seattle Storm did not play any. The more sticking point, however, most teams like the Chicago Sky, Storm, Mercury, and others played 20+ games with just a day of rest. Keep in mind, these are 5 v 5 games at arguably higher intensity than Unrivaled. It led to a season record of 252 injuries, up from 204 in 2024 (per the IX).\n\nThere were notable injuries in the 2025 Unrivaled as well. For example, Betnijah Laney-Hamilton had a knee injury she sustained as a relief player in Unrivaled and missed the majority of the WNBA season. Removing back-to-backs is an important step in solving that problem. NBA studies suggest that playing back-to-backs can increase injury probability.\n\nThe urgent nature of the decision also indicates that the league is committed to working to give the best environment for the players. Breanna Stewart and Co. are trying to do the same with the upcoming CBA. However, they could be making it worse before making it better.\n\nThe 2026 WNBA season is now in serious danger of being delayed. The deadline of January 9 passed without any extension as both sides entered a status quo. “We’re just going to continue to negotiate in good faith,” Breanna Stewart said. Now, the free agency has been frozen by a moratorium agreement.\n\n“The moratorium will apply specifically to free agency, sources told FOS, including the sending out of qualifying offers, core designations, signings, and all negotiations,” Annie Costabile wrote. “An email was sent to front office executives on Monday evening explaining the terms of the moratorium, league sources told FOS. The free-agency pause will end once a new collective bargaining agreement is ratified.”\n\nFree agency extension is effective until they agree to a new CBA. Based on the current signs, that will likely take some time. Even after the CBA is agreed upon, this is not a normal free agency. Most of the league (around 80%) is currently without a team in anticipation of the new ‘transformational’ CBA.\n\nThere will be a record number of deals signed and immense movement in the market. Everything of which will take some time. So, the league can’t assign a very limited period to get it over with. Then the WNBA has the 2025 Rookie draft and the expansion draft with two teams to complete. There could be a delay in starting the 2026 WNBA season, which would normally begin in mid-May.\n\nYou can’t extend beyond November because of the NBA and the rest of the American Sports seasons beginning. Many WNBA teams share facilities with them, and the league risks losing broadcasting slots as well. All in all, the league has an astronomical task to plan a normal regular season.\n\nThe post Co-Founder Breanna Stewart Pinpoints Key Unrivaled Advantage Players Rarely Get Elsewhere appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "Kittle was carted off the field during the 49ers' 23-19 win over the Eagles in the Wild Card round",
    "fullText": "During the San Francisco 49ers' 23-19 playoff win over the Eagles in Philadelphia on Sunday, Jan. 11, 49ers tight end George Kittle tore his Achilles tendon\n\nThe following day, he acknowledged the injury and transparently shared his mixed emotions\n\n“Football sucks sometimes. But I love it,\" he wrote on Instagram\n\nGeorge Kittle is candidly discussing the difficulties of professional football.\n\nKittle, 32, was carried off the field with a torn Achilles tendon during the second quarter of the San Francisco 49ers' Wild Card playoff victory against the Eagles in Philadelphia on Sunday, Jan. 11.\n\n“Football sucks sometimes. But I love it,\" the 49ers tight end began an Instagram post on the day after the game. Kittle included some photos of himself on the field and a picture of his wife, Claire Kittle, kissing him in the locker room.\n\n“I love these guys and this team. Heartbroken but have felt so much love and support from everyone reaching out,” Kittle wrote. “I’ll be good. Thank you. We aren’t done yet!”\n\nHe added that the team’s owner, Jed York, was “the first person” to meet him in the locker room, which proved to Kittle that he’s “in a special place.”\n\n“🥃 cheers, all my love,” the caption concluded, seemingly in reference to the reports he asked for tequila after his exit from the field.\n\nThe Instagram carousel closed with a Calvin and Hobbes comic strip that featured Calvin saying, \"You know, Hobbes, some days my lucky rocketship underpants don’t help.\"\n\n“Well, you’ve done all you can do,\" Hobbes replied.\n\n“My real life superhero 👊💪😤⚡️,\" Claire wrote when sharing the post to her Instagram Stories.\n\n“Love you bro 🙌,\" Kittle's teammate Eddy Piñeiro wrote, while Demarcus Robinson added, “All Love Family We Need That Energy Brothers Keeper ❤️💯.”\n\nKittle's teammates also offered kind words after their victory against the Eagles. During the post-game press conference, Christian McCaffrey said that \"it's a tough loss\" that Kittle will miss the rest of the season.\n\n\"This team has carried the character of George Kittle throughout the entire year, and since I got traded here, he's the heart and soul of this team,\" the running back said.\n\n“When you lose a leader like that, you never really lose him because his presence is still in the locker room...,” McCaffrey added, before concluding, “He's a leader, heart and soul of this team. So praying for him, love him, we're going to play for him the rest of the way.\"\n\nKittle was taken off the field during the second quarter after the tight end caught a six-yard pass with around six minutes to play before halftime. He was later ruled out for the remainder of the game. It was then confirmed that Kittle tore his right Achilles tendon after the catch.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nThe 49ers take on the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round of the NFL playoffs on Saturday, Jan. 17.",

    "description": "The Boston Celtics suffered a heartbreaking 98-96 loss to the Indiana Pacers today, with Pacers star Pascal Siakam delivering a game-winning basket with six seconds remaining on the clock.

    "fullText": "The Boston Celtics suffered a heartbreaking 98-96 loss to the Indiana Pacers today, with Pacers star Pascal Siakam delivering a game-winning basket with six seconds remaining on the clock. After the game, however, Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla didn’t shy away from expressing his feelings.\n\nIn the postgame conference, Mazzulla was asked six questions. Every single one of them met the same two-word answer: “Illegal screen.” Over and over, refusing to elaborate or pivot, and didn’t soften the message. It was almost surgical, and it made it unmistakably clear which moment he thought decided the game.\n\nDuring that key final sequence, to begin the possession, Siakam set a screen for Pacers guard Andrew Nembhard, and appeared to throw a shoulder at Derrick White, who fell while attempting to chase Nembhard past the screen. Mazzulla seemingly blamed the referees for not calling the potential illegal screen, which, in his mind, decided the game.\n\nBoston didn’t lose just from one call, and Mazzulla knows that. However, when the game comes down to one possession, that margin for error feels a lot heavier, with every potential officiating mistake being the difference between a win and a loss. This is something that has already plagued this team throughout the season.\n\nJust days ago, Celtics star Jaylen Brown unloaded on officials with an expletive-filled rant after a loss, openly inviting a fine while calling out a perceived one-sided whistle on a night the Celtics shot just four total free throws. The league reacted swiftly, handing out a $35,000 fine to the forward.\n\nTonight, the Celtics were already shorthanded, missing their leading scorer, Brown, and a key wing presence in Josh Minott, leaving Payton Pritchard and Derrick White to carry the load, logging a combined 41 points, but ultimately falling short.\n\nJoe Mazzulla has been here before. Almost two years ago, a very similar situation took place. In a game against the Pacers tied at 131, Brown took a shot with 3.1 seconds on the clock, and Pacers guard Buddy Hield hit his head in an attempt to block. However, no foul was called, and on the other end, the Pacers managed to score after Brown’s shot missed.\n\nMazzulla told reporters back then that he “can’t wait until four o’clock tomorrow,” continuously repeating the “four o’clock” phrase, referring to the time the NBA’s two-minute report releases.\n\nIn the report, however, the contact on Brown’s head was deemed incidental in the report. Still, it revealed multiple missed or mistaken calls that went against the Celtics, including a legal contest from Kristaps Porzingis as well as a missed illegal screen on Myles Turner. It seems that even Pacers players realized the foul should have been called, with Hield admitting he told Mazzulla that he fouled Brown:\n\n“I told Joe what I told Joe. But they have three refs out there and they have the replay center, and that’s what replay is for, I guess.”\n\nTonight was just deja vu for the coach and his squad. All they can do now is wait for the two-minute report and hope the NBA recognizes their pleas.\n\nThe post Disappointed Joe Mazzulla Accuse NBA Refs Using 2 Words After Celtics Loss appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "Connor Ingram's steady, composed goaltending in Chicago delivered a crucial win for the Oilers. Is it enough for him to stay with the team?",
    "fullText": "Connor Ingram didn’t steal the spotlight in Chicago, but he did play well enough to be the Oilers' best player on Monday night, battling toe-to-toe with Spencer Knight. Ingram not only picked up the win, but he's making a case that the Edmonton Oilers shouldn't quickly brush Ingram aside when Tristan Jarry is set to return.\n\nIn a 4–1 Oilers win over the Blackhawks, Ingram turned aside 29 of 30 shots for his fourth win of the season, continuing a stretch of steady, composed play that’s becoming harder for Edmonton to ignore.\n\nThe Oilers controlled much of the action, but there were turnover issues at points in the game, and some Grade A chances that Ingram had to be sharp on. He bailed out a very loose Oilers team on several occasions and shut the door, preventing Chicago from capitalizing on any momentum they'd built.\n\nThat’s now six quality starts in seven appearances. No drama. No scrambling. Just calm, efficient goaltending.\n\nIn any other situation, that should be enough to warrant sticking around.\n\nHis positional play is elite. He looks like he's making the expected saves look easy. He stays square to shooters, takes away angles early, and forces opponents to miss the net — wide, high, or straight into his chest. It’s the kind of goaltending that doesn’t end up on highlight reels but is exactly what Edmonton needs. He’s doing exactly what you want a goalie in his position to do: beat the teams you’re supposed to beat, stay composed, and give your team a chance every night.\n\nHe might be the best technical goalie of the three the Oilers will have to choose from. And, the Oilers will have to choose.\n\nEdmonton suddenly has one too many goaltenders who appear to be playing well enough to hold a spot on the NHL roster. That’s not a bad problem — but it is a complicated one.\n\nWaivers loom, roster decisions are coming, and Ingram keeps making it harder to justify sending him out of the picture. But, as good as Ingram is playing, the Oilers have to consider asset management, and they will likely lose Calvin Pickard on waivers if they make him the odd man out.\n\nEdmonton could try to carry three temporarily — but that creates problems of its own. Keeping three goalies rarely works in practice, limits game action, and risks pushing Ingram past the threshold where he’d require waivers to be sent down.\n\nRight now, demoting Ingram is the simplest solution. He can be sent to the minors, continue playing regularly, and avoid sitting idle. Pickard, meanwhile, has value as a cheap, NHL-capable backup — something that matters even more come playoff time. Losing him on waivers could leave the Oilers exposed if injuries resurface, especially with Tristan Jarry’s recent health concerns.\n\nOutside of those three, the AHL success story that is Connor Ungar appears promising, but relying on him right now is risky. The priority should be protecting depth and flexibility. For that reason, the most logical move is to send Ingram down, keep Pickard, and avoid unnecessary risk while the Oilers sort through a crowded — but valuable — crease.\n\nIt's not a question of whether Ingram has earned the right to stick around. Unfortunately, his performances alone might not matter.\n\nConnor McDavid extended his point streak to 19 games with two assists. Analysts and fans keep saying this might be the best he's ever played in his career. His Dad was asked during the intermission if he thinks this is the best his son has played, and Brian McDavid said Connor is healthy and feeling good. But, as someone would expect of a McDavid response, he feels there's more he can do. \"I just think he's playing free... confidence is a huge thing, even for a player like him.\"\n\nEvan Bouchard scored twice and added a helper, continuing a point-per-game season (46 points in 46 games).\n\nZach Hyman, Leon Draisaitl, and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins all chipped in. This was a solid win for the Oilers, the first of a back-to-back.\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Edmonton Oilers team site to never miss the latest news, game-day coverage, and more.   Add us to your Google News favourites, and never miss a story.",

    "description": "Aaron Rodgers walking away from Pittsburgh after one season as the team's starting quarterback despite another playoff loss would be a mistake.",
    "fullText": "3 reasons Aaron Rodgers shouldn't retire after Steelers' bad wild-card playoff loss to Texans originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAaron Rodgers and the Pittsburgh Steelers' offense had a brutal experience against the Texans' defense in getting blown out at home, 30-6 in Monday night's wild-card playoff game.\n\nWhile Houston advances to face host New England in the divisional round, Pittsburgh suffered its seventh consecutive playoff loss. Rodgers, before getting pulled for the futile final two-minute drill, failed to lead the Steelers on a touchdown drive.\n\nRodgers (17-of-33, 146 yards, INT, fumble lost, 4.4 yards per attempt, 4 sacks, 50.8 passer rating) not only struggled vs. the Texans' pressure in coverage, but his two turnovers also were returned for TDs that turned a close fourth-quarter game into a rout.\n\nCould Rodgers really end his career with the worst playoff performance of his Hall of Fame career? There are good reasons to believe Rodgers won't retire and decide to return to Pittsburgh for the 2026 season — one more shot at redemption at age 42.\n\nWhat Aaron Rodgers said about potential NFL retirement\n\nWhere Steelers ugly loss to Texans rank among worst Rodgers playoff losses\n\n3 reasons why Aaron Rodgers should come back for 2026 season\n\nRodgers is still sharp in his ability to process and there is no decline in his passing arm strength. More importantly, after his turbulent injury-marred two seasons with the Jets in his bumpy transition from the Packers, Rodgers put aside the off-field drama and was refocused on the field to lead the Steelers back to the playoffs as AFC North champions.\n\nSeveral times, Rodgers has mentioned that he's felt at home again, being one of the guys in Pittsburgh. He also made a point to say how fortunate he was to play for Mike Tomlin.\n\nPresuming Tomlin chooses to stay, his presence would be a big factor in trying to convince Rodgers to play one more year. Despite the misery at the end, there still was plenty of football joy for Rodgers to had playing for another storied and class organization.\n\nThe Steelers, personnel-wise, need a lot of wide receiver help and some offensive line upgrades, too. Rodgers needed to lean too much on running backs Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell and the tight ends to move the ball. DK Metcalf is a good downfield threat, but he is also inconsistent with his hands and routes. He would be better off with a strong slot-based No. 1, much like a prime Tyler Lockett in Seattle.\n\nCalvin Austin III is overwhelmed as a No. 2 and needing Adam Thielen and Marquez Valdes-Scantling to play big roles was desperate. They also need to explore upgrading tackle in the draft with the No. 21 overall pick when their clock for the first round in Pittsburgh on April 23.  The Steelers should have a better understanding of where Rodgers needs the support to be lifted and be better positioned to make moves tailored toward Rodgers.\n\nTexans defense stifles Aaron Rodgers, Steelers in wild-card win\n\nWill Mike Tomlin, Steelers part ways after another first-round playoff exit?\n\nHow Steelers failed to take advantage of C.J. Stroud turnovers\n\nWhen Tom Brady threw a pick-six in his final pass for the Patriots in their ugly 20-13 home wild-card loss to the Titans in the 2019-2020 AFC playoffs, it seemed like he was \"washed\" as an NFL QB at 42. One season later with the Buccaneers, he put up familiar MVP-caliber status and led Tampa Bay to a winning four-game Super Bowl 55 run — including outlasting Rodgers' Green Bay team to take the NFC title.\n\nBrady having that comeback, albeit with a new team, provided more of a storybook ending in the final chapter. That should inspire and motivate Rodgers to think he can do something similar as an all-time great QB to rewrite his post-Packers narrative.\n\nThe Steelers were a flawed team in many ways. Rodgers put together their offense as best he could with his limited weapons and blocking. In the end, they were bound to lose a battle of attrition to a strong defensive team, such as the Texans.\n\nThe only reason Rodgers should retire is if he doesn't believe he can win big with the Steelers. It would make a lot more sense for him to wait and have confidence that their offseason will play out in his favor before walking away from the game for good.",

After all, they hadn’t lost at home on a Monday since Oct. 14, 1991.\n\nUnfortunately for the Steelers, that 23-game winning streak came to a brutal end this week at the worst possible time as they suffered their first Monday home loss in 35 years.\n\nPittsburgh jumped out to an early lead on Chris Boswell’s first-quarter field goal and kept the game close for most of the evening, holding the Houston Texans to just seven points through the first three quarters.

    "fullText": "NASCAR does not always appreciate drivers speaking out against the organization or its rules. It expects obedience and prefers that drivers walk a straight line that does not upset investors or sponsors, and teams often expect the same. At times, however, a situation becomes so dire that internal criticism is warranted, and you know it has merit when the top brass is willing to welcome it. That is why Denny Hamlin and Mark Martin were widely praised by NASCAR leadership following the sweeping changes the sport has seen of late.\n\nWhile most of the field bends to the unspoken rules of the sports, figures like Hamlin and Martin care more about the future of the sport. They realize that the demands of the fans matter more.\n\nHamlin took on the promotion through an antitrust lawsuit and emerged victorious, helping make charters permanent and giving teams something they had long wanted. Martin, meanwhile, went to battle against the elimination-style playoff format and has come out a winner as well.\n\nThis unruliness has impressed many within the Daytona headquarters itself. NASCAR President Steve O’Donnell told the press after announcing on Monday that the Cup Series will return to the Chase format, “The two loudest voices I have heard in my career on formats are Denny Hamlin and Mark Martin.”\n\n“What I give those guys an extreme amount of credit for is that their job was to go out and win races, right? At the end of the day, they could say, ‘You guys figure it out.’ But they care. They care about the future of the sport. Seeing their passion and seeing their inputs have been hugely important.”\n\nKennedy currently serves as the Executive Vice President and Chief Venue & Racing Innovations Officer for NASCAR. He said that Martin had created an impact on them in the very first playoff committee meeting by explaining how the sport was getting more disconnected from the traditional fan.\n\n“He had a very particular viewpoint, and he was one of the loudest voices in the room,” he said. “He was a large contributor to the format we came up with today. If Martin hadn’t been in that room that day, we would be announcing something different today, where consistency may not be this important.”\n\nMartin’s campaign against the elimination-style format began after the 2025 Daytona 500 weekend. That’s when NASCAR decided to form the committee and discuss in which direction the sport must head to serve fans the best. Since then, he has ridden a demanding roller coaster and finally landed the train here. Thanks to him, for the first time in many years, the next NASCAR champion could be decided without much controversy.\n\nThe post NASCAR Executives Hail Denny Hamlin and Mark Martin for Massive Role in Bringing Changes in NASCAR appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Connor Ingram's performance Monday night against the Blackhawks was something else. When the Edmonton Oilers traded for him, I'll be the first to admit it: I didn't think he was the answer. I still don't think he's some saviour who's going to single-handedly carry this team to a Cup. But he's proven to be better than what we all gave him credit for. He can come in and win games for Edmonton. He's reliable. He's steady. He's the kind of goaltender that doesn't make Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl worry about what's happening behind them.\n\nIs that responsible for McDavid's legendary tear right now? Absolutely not. Not even a little bit. But if you're an Oilers fan watching this team, it's probably nice to worry a little less about goaltending than you have in recent years.\n\nIngram stopped 29 shots thrown at him on Monday, and he did it while his dad was on the dads' trip watching from the stands. There's something about performing well when family's around—it just hits different.\n\n\"I felt good,\" Ingram said. \"It's starting to feel more normal every time we get out there. Luckily for me, I've been able to play a lot, so you can find a rhythm and just try and stick to it and hold on as long as you can. I thought I felt good today.\"\n\nPlaying a lot matters for goalies. They're rhythm players. Ingram's gotten consistent starts lately, and it shows. He's not coming in cold every two weeks wondering where his game is. He's playing regularly, building confidence, and delivering results.\n\nHaving his dad there made the performance even better.\n\nLike Father, Like Son: Leon Draisaitl's Hockey DNA Runs Deep Leon Draisaitl is one of the best players in the NHL. He's a perennial Hart Trophy candidate, a scoring machine, and Connor McDavid's partner in crime on one of the most dangerous duos in hockey. But before all that, he was just a kid hanging around the rink, watching his dad play.\n\n\"I've been away from home since I was 16, so it's been 12 years since my dad drove me to hockey, and it's cool to have him around and ride the bus with them,\" Ingram said. \"They see a lot from the outside, but it's really eye-opening for them, I think, to see what our day-to-day looks like and to see what this life looks like. So it's fun to share it with them, and it's fun to just have them around.\"\n\nKris Knoblauch saw what everyone else saw: a goaltender who gave his team a chance to win and then some.\n\n\"He played really well,\" Knoblauch said. \"You think about the first shift of the game, he came up with a couple of big saves there, and then the rest of the game he had some nice saves, but we really relied on him in the third period. In the second period on the penalty kill, there were numerous great scoring chances that Chicago had, and he played really well. Unfortunately, we gave up that one at the end, but a great effort by him.\"\n\nNHL Rumors: 3 Oilers Who Could Sign Extensions Next The Oilers signed Quinn Hutson to a contract extension. Who could they extend next?\n\nSo now what? That's the question the Oilers are going to have to answer sooner or later. Tristan Jarry is still out injured. When he comes back, someone's going to have to move. Does Ingram stick around? Does Calvin Pickard get sent to Bakersfield instead?\n\nKnoblauch wouldn't touch that question with a ten-foot pole when asked about it before the team left for this road trip. Fair enough—he's not going to create controversy or hurt feelings by speculating publicly. But eventually, it's time to start thinking about it. And games like Monday night in Chicago make it a lot harder to justify sending Ingram down.\n\nPickard's been a solid backup goalie. He's on a more team-friendly contract. He's been with the organization longer. But Ingram is playing better right now. He's winning games. He's giving the Oilers exactly what they need from a backup goalie—solid, reliable performances that don't cost you points.\n\nOilers Sign Soaring Prospect To Contract Extension The Oilers have extended this promising prospect.\n\nYou can't just ignore that. You can't send a guy down who's playing well because the organizational depth chart says someone else should be ahead of him. Not when you're second in the division and trying to get to first. Not when every point matters in a tight race.\n\nThe goaltending situation in Edmonton has been a question mark for years. Fans have spent seasons stressing about whether the team could get adequate goaltending when it mattered. Ingram isn't solving all of those concerns, but he's providing something valuable: consistency. Nights like Monday in Chicago are becoming the norm for him, not the exception.\n\nOilers Fall Short: Still No Three-Game Win Streak The <a href=\"https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/edmonton-oilers#google_vignette\">Edmonton Oilers</a> lost to the Los Angeles Kings Saturday night, and with it went another chance at stringing together three consecutive wins. It's becoming a familiar story this season—win two, lose one, repeat. The elusive three-game win streak remains out of reach.\n\nWhen Jarry returns, the Oilers have a decision to make. It's not an easy one. But if Ingram keeps playing like this, the answer might be clearer than anyone expected when they first made the trade. Sometimes players just fit. Sometimes a change of scenery unlocks something. Maybe that's what's happening here.\n\nFor now, Ingram's making his case every time he plays. The rest will sort itself out.\n\nBookmark The Hockey News Edmonton Oilers team site to never miss the latest news, game-day coverage, and more.   Add us to your Google News favourites, and never miss a story.",

It was Perry's 500th career assist, making him the first player in league history to reach the milestone at age 40.\n\nLos Angeles has been held to one goal 12 times in 45 games.\n\nThe Stars got captain Jamie Benn back after missing three games because of a cut on his nose, which he sustained Jan. 4. Benn, a 17-year veteran, played with a visor for the first time in 1,216 career games, leaving Nashville center Ryan O’Reilly, Minnesota defenseman Zach Bogosian, and Sharks winger Ryan Reaves as the last three active players who have never worn a visor in an NHL game.\n\nStars: Visit Anaheim on Tuesday.\n\nKings: Host Vegas on Wednesday.\n\nAP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",

    "description": "A 42-point effort from Luka Doncic isn't enough for the Lakers to overcome Sacramento's 59% shooting and 17 three-pointers in 124-112 a loss.",
    "fullText": "Lakers coach JJ Redick was asked before Monday's game against the Sacramento Kings how he could ensure his players wouldn't underestimate a nine-win team.\n\n“We don't look at any game as a walkover,” Redick said.\n\nThen the Kings walked all over the Lakers, taking a 20-point lead in the third quarter before winning 124-112 at Golden 1 Center.\n\nLuka Doncic did his best to keep the Lakers in the game, scoring 42 points and collecting eight assists and seven rebounds. But he scored just two points in the fourth quarter and looked slower after having his left thigh wrapped at the end of the third quarter.\n\nThe Lakers got to within seven points in the fourth, but the Kings pulled away. DeMar DeRozan scored 32 points and Russell Westbrook finished with 22 points and seven assists for the Kings (10-30), who shot 59% from the field (48-82) and made 17 three-pointers.\n\nLeBron James, who scored 22 points, wore a patch on his jersey commemorating his unprecedented 23rd NBA season in the city where he played his first NBA game. It features a silhouette of his pregame chalk toss and three colored stripes that represents the three franchises he has played on — the Lakers, Cavaliers and Heat.\n\nHe will wear the patch for the remainder of the season. After each game, the patch will be removed from his jersey, dated and shipped to a Topps’ production facility to be authenticated and inserted into a pack of trading cards.\n\nThe Lakers (23-14) looked strong from the onset when Deandre Ayton won the jump ball and eventually threw a lob pass to James for a 2-0 Lakers lead, a play that has become something the Lakers have used several times to start a game.\n\nJames hit his first four shots and the Lakers took an 8-2 lead before everything started to crumble.\n\nThey were behind 59-43 late in the second quarter. They couldn’t stop Malik Monk, who had 18 points off the bench on six-for-eight shooting, including five for six from three-point range. Monk finished with 26 points.\n\nAfter the hot start, James finished the first half going five for 12 from the field for 12 points. He finished the game shooting eight for 17.\n\nThe Lakers will play the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday night at Crypto.com Arena. When the Lakers played a back-to-back game last week, James sat out the second game. Will he do the same Tuesday?\n\n“We’ll see how he feels in the morning,” Redick said.\n\nPerhaps Rui Hachimura will make his return from right calf soreness. He was available to play Monday, but he sat out his seventh consecutive game.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Steelers record on 'Monday Night Football': Inside Pittsburgh's streak of 23 straight home wins since 1991 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers haven't won a playoff game since 2016, a trend that continued with their 30-6 loss to the Houston Texans to conclude the 2025 season. The Steelers have made the playoffs six times since their last postseason win, one of the biggest critiques about current head coach Mike Tomlin.\n\nPittsburgh might have had its best shot to break that cold spell against Houston thanks to the NFL's scheduling, with the Steelers hosting the Texans in the final 2026 wild-card game of the weekend on \"Monday Night Football.\"\n\nPittsburgh was on an unreal run with home games played on Monday night. In fact, the Steelers went into the game having won 23 consecutive Monday night home games.\n\nHere is more on the Steelers' impressive streak that the Texans snapped.\n\nTexans defense stifles Aaron Rodgers, Steelers in wild-card win\n\nWill Mike Tomlin, Steelers part ways after another first-round playoff exit?\n\nHow Steelers failed to take advantage of C.J. Stroud turnovers\n\nPittsburgh went a total of 34 years not seeing its football team lose at home on a Monday night. So, why did that streak exist? Well, for starters, there are only a handful of Monday night games per season, and it is very rare for teams to play in more than one. Also, this record applied to only home games played on Monday night, further shrinking the Steelers' sample size.\n\nStill, it was extremely impressive that Pittsburgh won 23 home \"Monday Night Football\" games in a row. It was officially snapped when the Steelers were beat in the playoffs by the Texans in a \"Monday Night Football\" home game in January 2026.\n\n.@notthefakeSVP: \"History says [road games are] not the path to make the Super Bowl.\"@A_train2_: \"History says Mike Tomlin doesn't lose on Monday Night Football.\" 🤫 pic.twitter.com/2oIv8AArrJ\n\n— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) January 13, 2026\n\nHere is a look at the Steelers' Monday night win streak.\n\nMORE: Is Aaron Rodgers going to retire?\n\nSustaining a win streak that long was already impressive enough, but it gets heightened with the fact that the streak had continued through two different head coaches.\n\nChuck Noll was the Steelers head coach when the franchise had last lost on a Monday night at home. Bill Cowher took over in 1992, and he went 11-0 for home \"Monday Night Football\" games. He stepped down in 2006 and current head coach Mike Tomlin took over in 2007. Since he took over, Tomlin had gone 12-0 at home on \"Monday Night Football\" before his playoff loss to the Texans.\n\nMORE: How did the Steelers clinch the AFC North?\n\nThe Steelers have an all-time \"Monday Night Football\" record of 49-25, including their most recent playoff loss to Houston. This record includes games both home and away on Monday nights. Prior to the 2026 playoff defeat, Pittsburgh's most recent Monday night loss came on December 21, 2020 when the Steelers lost 27-17 to the Bengals in Cincinnati.\n\nMORE:NFL's highest paid coaches, from Andy Reid to Mike Tomlin",

    "fullText": "As expected, a former Chelsea manager has now been linked to Real Madrid as they hunt for a new long term manager.\n\nXabi Alonso became the latest high profile manager to leave his position at his club yesterday, as he parted ways with Real Madrid with immediate effect.\n\nHe followed the likes of Enzo Maresca and Ruben Amorim, who both left their roles as head coach at Chelsea and Manchester United at the start of 2026. It’s been a wild start to the year managerial wise so far.\n\nWe expected drama in the transfer market in January, but we didn’t expect such a managerial merry-go-round. And now we have three managers out of position and potentially looking for work again as soon as possible.\n\nAnd one of them might be offered Alonso’s former role, with Enzo Maresca reportedly being admired by Real Madrid.\n\nCole Palmer and Enzo Maresca during a warmup.\n\nReporter Santi Aouna of Foot Mercato wrote on X last night that Jurgen Klopp is the dream target for Real Madrid, but Enzo Maresca is also admired by them.\n\nI’d personally be surprised if Real Madrid went for Maresca at this stage. Klopp and Maresca certainly play pretty different styles of football as well, so the links are a little odd really.\n\nA former Chelsea player who has also worked with Liam Rosenior before, has told Blues fans what to expect from his style of play going forward.\n\nMeanwhile, in his first match for Chelsea, Rosenior had to remind his wingers of their duty after the starting options completed zero crosses early in the game.",

    "fullText": "Luka Doncic scored 42 points but could not prevent the Los Angeles Lakers stumbling to a third straight defeat with a 124-112 loss against the lowly Sacramento Kings on Monday.\n\nLeBron James wore a special patch on his uniform to mark his historic 23rd season in the NBA and scored 22 points on a frustrating night for the Lakers, who made just eight three-pointers from 36 attempts.\n\nDoncic and James were among only four Lakers players to make double figures with Deandre Ayton finishing with 13 points and Jaxson Hayes adding 12 off the bench.\n\nThe Kings, one place off the bottom of the Western Conference with a 10-30 record, were led by 32 points from DeMar DeRozan with Russell Westbrook finishing with 22 points against his former team.\n\n\"We literally couldn't make a shot,\" Lakers coach JJ Redick said.\n\nIn other games, the Indiana Pacers bagged their third straight victory with an upset 98-96 win over the Boston Celtics in Indianapolis.\n\nPascal Siakam led the scoring with 21 points for the Pacers, last year's NBA Finals runners-up who remain rooted to the foot of the Eastern Conference with a 9-31 record.\n\nSiakam scored what turned out to be the winning basket, banking in a floating jump shot with seven seconds remaining to give the Pacers a rare home victory.\n\nBoston's Derrick White missed a 32-foot three-point attempt with two seconds left on the clock as the Pacers held on for the win.\n\nIn Toronto, the 39-year-old Kyle Lowry was given a rousing reception as the Philadelphia 76ers romped to a 115-102 win over the Raptors.\n\nLowry, a beloved figure in Toronto after helping the Raptors to their lone NBA title in 2019, was given a standing ovation in the fourth quarter as the crowd saluted what was likely his final appearance in Toronto before he retires.\n\nLowry made a fleeting appearance for Philadelphia, playing just under two minutes as the Sixers cruised to victory thanks to 33 points from Tyrese Maxey and a 27-point contribution from Joel Embiid.\n\nMaxey led the tributes to Lowry afterwards, revealing how the veteran had helped his career since arriving in Philadelphia in 2024.\n\nMaxey said: \"We talk at least five times a day. It started as soon as he got here. He just told me, 'Listen, man. I'm here for you. Whatever you need me to do, whatever you need from me, I'm here for you.'\n\n\"He’s been that way every single day no matter what.\"\n\nThe Utah Jazz scored an upset 123-112 defeat of the Cleveland Cavaliers on the back of 32 points from Keyonte George and 28 points from Lauri Markkanen.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAaron Rodgers wasn’t ready to talk about his future following the Pittsburgh Steelers 30-6 playoff loss to the Houston Texans on Monday night.\n\nRodgers, who signed just a one-year deal with Pittsburgh last offseason, was obviously disappointed with the outcome of the contest and likely with his own performance as well.\n\nAfter the game, the veteran signal-caller said that he didn’t want to make any major decisions regarding his future based on emotion.\n\n“I’m not going to make any emotional decision,” Rodgers said after the game. “Disappointed, obviously. It was such a fun year. Lot of adversity, but a lot of fun. … It’s disappointing to be sitting here with the season over.”\n\nWhen asked how he’ll approach the decision, Rodgers, 42, says he plans to “get away and have the right conversations.”\n\n\"I'm not going to make any emotional decisions.\"\n\n–Aaron Rodgers when asked about his future. pic.twitter.com/3gU7HNNVC1\n\n— ESPN (@espn) January 13, 2026\n\nWhile he had some moments, Rodgers largely looked like a shell of his former MVP-self throughout the season in Pittsburgh, and against the Texans, he didn’t necessarily look like a guy with a lot of gas left in the tank.\n\nMore: Steelers predicted to sign Aaron Rodgers replacement in free agency\n\nRodgers completed just 17 out of 33 passes for 146 yards against the Texans. He had one interception and no touchdowns, and he struggled to push the ball down the field all game, averaging just 4.4 yards per completion. Granted, Houston’s defense is really good, but those were the same struggles that Rodgers had all season.\n\nA recent report suggested that the Steelers would welcome Rodgers back if he wanted to play for another season, but that was before the offense laid an egg in the postseason. Perhaps things have changed.\n\nFor now, the Steelers, and the rest of the football world, will have to wait for Rodgers’ decision. He didn’t sign with the Steelers until June last year. Hopefully we won't have to wait that long for an answer this time around.",

The 49ers ran all over the Packers, as Raheem Mostert produced a historic stat line, giving the Packers' offense no chance to make the game close. Once again, the opponent went up big early, as the 49ers had a 27-0 lead after 30 minutes.\n\n🏄The NFC Championship turned into a Raheem Mostert clinic 🏄@RMos_8Ball\n🚨 220 rushing yards on 29 carries\n🚨 4 rushing TD\n🚨 Single postseason game rushing record set @49ers | #GoNinerspic.twitter.com/4GhTrWk5L9\n\nMORE: What's next for Mike Tomlin after loss to Texans?\n\nOf all the losses on this list, this one likely hurts the most. After winning the Super Bowl, the Packers went 15-1 during the following season and were the overwhelming favorites in the playoffs.

The plan at the time, according to sources, was to send 14 reporters and photographers to Tokyo to produce a separate daily color section, as it first did in 1984 when the games were held in Los Angeles. The Times will be covering next month’s Winter Games in Italy with one writer as Thuc Nhi Nguyen will be taking a break from the Lakers beat to cover the games in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nWhen Patrick Soon-Shiong purchased the Los Angeles Times in 2018, he told The Washington Post, “One of our priorities is to be the sports paper of the nation.” Since the pandemic in 2020, however, the sports section has been reduced to the final four or five pages of the California section five days a week, with a standalone sports section of six to eight pages appearing only twice per week.\n\nDespite its statewide branding, the California Post's initial sports coverage will be centered squarely on Los Angeles, with a primary emphasis on the sports and teams the Los Angeles Times still covers in the Dodgers, Lakers, Rams, Chargers, USC and UCLA.\n\nHernandez and Harris will lead its MLB and Dodgers coverage, while Southern California News Group Lakers beat writer Khobi Price and longtime Lakers reporter Melissa Rohlin, who joined the Post last week, will anchor its NBA and Lakers coverage. Bonsignore will lead the NFL and Rams coverage while Bolch will lead college sports coverage, focusing on USC and UCLA.\n\nThe staffing losses at the Los Angeles Times come amid continued upheaval at the paper, which has faced newsroom cuts, buyouts and mounting uncertainty about its long-term investment in daily sports coverage.\n\nMeanwhile, the California Post is not done hiring. Sources familiar with the startup’s plans say the outlet is continuing to pursue additional Times sports writers and other well-known local journalists before its launch on Jan. 26.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are set to announce Michael Carrick as caretaker manager until the end of the season after the shock decision to sack Ruben Amorim last week.\n\nUnder-18s coach Darren Fletcher took charge of the senior side in Amorim’s absence, leading United to a draw with Burnley in the Premier League and a defeat in the FA Cup third round against Brighton & Hove Albion.\n\nThere were even suggestions the Scot was under consideration to take the role permanently, but these unimpressive results ruled him out of the running.\n\nInitially, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was the frontrunner for the role, with sporting director Jason Wilcox preferring the Norwegian to Carrick.\n\nHowever, a “strong interview” from the 44-year-old coach, who previously managed Middlesbrough for nearly three years, led United’s hierarchy to pivot towards him.\n\nSir Alex Ferguson is even understood to have given his approval to Carrick taking the helm at Old Trafford over Solskjaer.\n\nThe former midfielder will be officially announced tomorrow, with the small matter of the Manchester Derby this weekend to contend with as his first hurdle in the job.\n\nCarrick is expected to implement a fluid 4-2-3-1 system, a shift away from the 3-4-2-1 his predecessor was inexorably wed to and the sword upon which he ultimately fell. However, the transition of powers goes far beyond the formation on the pitch.\n\nThe dismissal of the Portuguese coach wipes the slate clean for a host of players, both inside and outside of Old Trafford. It also brings jeopardy to some who were closely allied with him, with their role in the team – and their future at the club – now under serious doubt.\n\nThe Peoples Person has analysed the workforce, including those on temporary leave, at United to assess which employees are the biggest winners and, conversely, the biggest losers from the boss’s sacking.\n\nLet’s dive in – starting with those who will have been celebrating the P45 notice last week.\n\nMainoo will be the biggest beneficiary of Amorim’s departure, as it would have been the midfielder leaving Old Trafford if the coach had remained. He was a poor fit in the 3-4-2-1 system, lacking the physicality to play in midfield and the attacking threat to be a forward. A shift to a three-man midfield, be it a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3, should see the 20-year-old technician re-establish himself as the future of the football club.\n\nYoro is another youngster set to benefit from Amorim’s dismissal, but the 20-year-old defender did not fall foul of his head coach in the way Mainoo did; rather, the French starlet was rated by Amorim but simply struggled to adapt to the demands his system placed on the outside centre-backs. Yoro established himself as the best defensive prospect in a back four with LOSC Lille. For the first time since arriving at Old Trafford, he will get the chance to play in this familiar setting under Carrick.\n\nDespite Fernandes being Amorim’s right-hand man, the Portuguese talisman will be unleashed in Carrick’s system, as he will return to his rightful No. 10 role. The 31-year-old has spent this season deployed deeper in a midfield pivot, playing closer to his own goal than the opposition’s, yet still has the most assists in the Premier League. Just imagine how many he’ll have if played further forward.\n\nPerhaps the most contentious choice on the list, but Rashford’s path to an unlikely Old Trafford return is much clearer without a Portuguese obstacle in his way. The 28-year-old forward has been red hot since joining Barcelona on loan. And while the Spanish giants want to keep him in Catalonia, their financial situation makes a permanent deal difficult. United are expected to look for a dynamic left winger this summer; Amorim’s dismissal means they already have one on their books.\n\nCasemiro had fought his way back into the fold at Old Trafford under Amorim, despite the “football having left him” in a horrifying campaign before the Portuguese tactician arrived. It had appeared a foregone conclusion that the 33-year-old Brazilian, who turns 34 next month, would leave United this summer, as his exorbitant contract is set to expire. But there was talk of a renewal, on reduced wages, given how important Amorim considered the defensive midfielder—which is why he is the biggest loser from Amorim’s exit, because he will now be following his head coach through the door.\n\nJack of all trades, master of none. Never has a statement applied more aptly to a footballer than Diogo Dalot, who is capable of playing as a full-back, wing-back, or winger, on both sides of the pitch, with equal ineffectiveness. There is a strong sense Dalot’s standing in the United dressing room – he is part of the leadership group – had more to do with him sharing his head coach’s mother tongue than anything he could do with a ball at his feet. When Noussair Mazraoui is back from the Africa Cup of Nations, Dalot should resume his rightful place on the bench.\n\nMount had found a home at Old Trafford under Amorim, after 15 months spent looking like a nomad after arriving from Chelsea. The 3-4-2-1 system was one the English midfielder had thrived in previously, and his best performances in a red shirt were delivered in it. Mount remains a great squad player, with excellent versatility, but a return to a 4-2-3-1 with flying wingers puts him in direct competition with Fernandes – a fight with only one winner, meaning there has to be a loser.\n\nWait, what? Wasn’t Bruno one of the biggest winners? Let me explain. Fernandes’ best position is as an attacking midfielder with the freedom to drift where he wants, as he will under Carrick. But the biggest proponent for United’s captain remaining United’s captain – given how close he came to leaving last summer amid eye-watering offers from Saudi Arabia – was Amorim. INEOS were, inexplicably, ambivalent whether Fernandes stayed or went – and if another bid arrives from the Middle East this summer, they will not have a fiery Portuguese coach demanding it is rejected. The most unfortunate part of Amorim’s exit is it increases the probability his compatriot on the pitch will also leave – and this would make the United fanbase the real losers.\n\nThere are strong arguments for even more players being affected, positively or negatively, by INEOS’s decision to bring an end to Amorim’s tumultuous tenure. Matheus Cunha is one, while the pair of right wingers – Amad and Bryan Mbeumo – are likely to now play in a system with only one right winger.\n\nBut, undoubtedly, the biggest loser in the debacle which has engulfed Old Trafford over the past week is Sir Jim Ratcliffe.\n\nINEOS have been nothing short of a disaster since the British billionaire became United’s co-owner in 2024, with a long list of inexplicable decisions, on and off the pitch, that have worsened the state of the club, not improved it. A fish rots from the head – and a foul stench is emanating from the Theatre of Dreams at the moment.\n\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Less playing time, same killer instinct, and a future that keeps everyone guessing",
    "fullText": "Robert Lewandowski no longer needs ninety minutes to leave his mark. At 37, with his contract winding down and his role reshaped under Hansi Flick, the Polish striker keeps doing the one thing that complicates every internal discussion at the club: scoring.\n\nHis goal in the Spanish Super Cup final against Real Madrid was just another reminder. The movement between the center backs, the timing of the run, the calm finish over Thibaut Courtois after Pedri’s pass. It was all classic Lewan-goal-ski.\n\nIt was also his fourth goal in a Super Cup final since arriving in 2022, a competition he seems to treat as personal territory. Three Super Cups, two league titles and a Copa del Rey later, he has reached 111 goals in a Barcelona shirt and is now ten away from breaking into the club’s top ten scorers, all-time.\n\nThe only thing that has changed with his advanced age is his place in the rhythm of matches. Flick has been willing to sit him down. Lewandowski has already watched three games this season from the bench without playing a minute and has come on nine times as a substitute. A muscle injury earlier in the campaign forced caution from the boss, but rotation has also been a deliberate choice, especially with Ferran Torres thriving in the same role. But the numbers simply refuse to align with the idea of decline. Ten goals in just over 1,000 minutes. One goal roughly every 100 minutes. Last season was even sharper: 42 goals, one every 93.5 minutes.\n\nBeing on the bench often has not slowed him down. He did not play a single minute in the Super Cup semifinal and still started and scored in the final. He came off the bench in the league derby against Espanyol and decided the game in the closing moments. According to Marca, Lewandowski has not challenged Flick over his reduced minutes and has accepted the situation without tension. After lifting the Super Cup, he summed it up simply: “we won the Super Cup as a team.”\n\nInside the dressing room, that attitude matters. Flick recently went further, stating, “I have never had a professional like him.” Scenes in training, from his constant interaction with Pedri and Ferran to his role welcoming Bardghji, point to a player who understands the moment he is in and is not fighting it.\n\nThe uncertainty, however, is real. Lewandowski’s contract expires on June 30 and his salary remains one of the highest in the squad. According to AS, Saudi Arabia is emerging as a serious option if he leaves, driven by both sporting interest and financial power. MLS clubs, including Chicago Fire, have also made inquiries, though their offers fall well short of Saudi figures. Lewandowski himself insists no decision has been taken and that discussions with Flick will be key, repeating that “the future is still open.”\n\nLewandowski plays less, but scores faster. He no longer dominates every lineup, but still decides finals. As the season heads toward its decisive stretch, his goals may yet define another title run.",

    "fullText": "Juventus are eyeing Manchester City ace Bernardo Silva, plotting a move for the diminutive Portuguese starlet this summer (h/t Gianluca DiMarzio).\n\nThe Bianconeri are understood to be monitoring the Man City midfielder’s contractual situation as part of a broader strategy to secure elite experience for the next phase of their rebuild.\n\nSilva’s current deal at the Etihad runs until June 2026, meaning suitors can start speaking to him this winter transfer window, making their case for him to join their club.\n\nNo formal approach has been made at this stage, but Juventus view the 30-year-old as a market opportunity worth tracking.\n\nWith financial balance remaining central to their planning, the Italian giants are content to wait and assess how Silva’s situation develops over the coming months.\n\nDespite not posting headline numbers this season, Silva remains a central cog in Pep Guardiola’s system.\n\nThe Portugal international has made 28 appearances across all competitions, scoring once in the Champions League and registering two assists in the Premier League.\n\nHowever, his value lies less in raw output and \n\nSilva’s pedigree is beyond question.\n\nHe has won every honour available in English football, boasts 107 international caps, and brings the kind of Champions League know-how Juventus have often prioritised when refreshing their squad.\n\nHis versatility, which allows him to operate as a central midfielder, an advanced playmaker, or a wide option, also aligns with Juventus’ desire for multifunctional profiles.\n\nInterest is not limited to Turin. Clubs such as Napoli and Como have also been linked with the Portuguese playmaker. Signing the former AS Monaco man would be a coup.\n\nFor now, Juventus are only watching.

    "fullText": "Liverpool are in the fight for Yan Diomande - but they have an alternative. And he's a true world-class talent, too.\n\nYan Diomande is one of the most in-demand talents in world football right now. The Ivorian has exploded onto the scene over the last year, first with Leganes and then at RB Leipzig this season.\n\nIt's widely expected that he'll move again in 2026, probably for a truly massive fee. Liverpool will likely try to be the team that pays that, according to several outlets.\n\nOne of those claiming it is Christian Falk, with the Bayern Munich insider suggesting the Reds are in the race along with most European giants. But there's the problem - the fight to win this race is intense and only one team can win.\n\nThus it's important that Liverpool have themselves at least one alternative on the wing. They do need to invest in the position, after all, and Diomande can't be their only option.\n\nIt seems they do have that alternative, though. And he's a truly world-class talent.\n\nThat report by Falk drops an interesting line: Liverpool have Said El Mala on their shortlist, too. Again, they’re not alone in that but it seems the Koln winger is the consolation prize here.\n\nAnd what a prize he is. El Mala is still only 19 but has six Bundesliga goals and two assists in a little over 600 minutes this season. It’s an incredible record, especially as Koln aren’t playing well.\n\nThey’ve won two of their last 14 Bundesliga games. Despite that, El Mala looks like one of the most exciting talents in the league - and one who could compete with Diomande.\n\nLiverpool showed in the summer that they rate Bundesliga talents very highly, spending massively on both Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike. It now seems that they’ll move for another one, be it Diomande or El Mala.\n\nThe latter certainly ticks the boxes Liverpool want. He’s averaging 2.76 successful take-ons per 90 minutes in the Bundesliga this season and the only player in the league averaging more with at least as many minutes is Diomande.\n\nHe’s winning tackles, too, and proving to be a threat in the air. All in all, El Mala is a world-class young talent and one who surely moves up a level in a better team.",

    "description": "The Lakers defense went from on the mend to very weak on Monday, and it resulted in an unacceptable loss to the Kings.",
    "fullText": "After back-to-back losses to the San Antonio Spurs and Milwaukee Bucks, the Los Angeles Lakers looked to get back in the win column when they faced the struggling Sacramento Kings on Monday. Sacramento had just ended a seven-game losing streak, and it came into this game with a 9-30 record, which was the second-worst record in the Western Conference.\n\nThe Lakers got out to an early 19-10 lead thanks to some active defense and several fast-break scores. But they went cold for an extended stretch soon afterward and fell behind by as many as 16 points in the second quarter. An 11-2 Lakers run brought them to within 61-54 at halftime, but Sacramento boosted its lead to 20 minutes later, and the Lakers were never able to mount a serious rally, resulting in a 124-112 loss for them.\n\nEven without three-time All-Star center Domantas Sabonis, who has a meniscus injury, the Kings were able to steamroll L.A. with some precise execution and offense. They shot 58.5% from the field and an unbelievable 65.4% from 3-point range, and they caught Los Angeles slow on its defensive rotations to 3-point shooters. Guard Malik Monk, a former Laker, burned his old team with 26 points and seven treys off the bench. Even Russell Westbrook, another former Laker, hit four of his eight attempts from downtown.\n\nLos Angeles' defense wasn't the only problem. While it shot 48.8% overall, it was just 8-of-36 from beyond the arc and had a pronounced lack of offensive balance. Only four of its players hit double figures in scoring, and only two of its men had more than 13 points.\n\nThe Lakers are now on a three-game losing streak, and with a 23-14 record, they're still in fifth place in the Western Conference, but they're in a virtual tie with the sixth-place Phoenix Suns. They're only half a game ahead of the Houston Rockets, who are in seventh place, and they will return home to face the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday.\n\nSmart had some moments where he played effective defense, but he was a liability on the other end of the court. He missed all five of his shot attempts and scored one point, to go along with two rebounds, two assists and two steals in 31 minutes.\n\nLaRavia was another player who contributed next to nothing offensively. He missed six of his seven shot attempts and went 0-of-5 from 3-point range, and he ended up with two points, two rebounds, three assists and one steal in 31 minutes.\n\nAyton had nine rebounds in the first half and 13 for the game, including five on the offensive glass, and he went 4-of-7 from the field. While he got eight free throw attempts, which is a high and unusual amount for him, he made just five of them, which limited him to 13 points in 27 minutes. Ayton also contributed one assist and two blocks, but L.A. could've used a little more scoring from him.\n\nJames got off to a hot start in this game with several transition buckets and 10 points overall in the first quarter. But he faded afterward and finished with an anemic 22 points on 8-of-17 field-goal shooting while missing all five of his 3-point tries. He also had four rebounds, three assists and one steal in 33 minutes.\n\nDoncic, at times, almost single-handedly prevented L.A. from falling completely out of this contest early on. He had 26 first-half points on 10-of-14 shooting, with 15 of them coming in bunches during the second quarter. He tried to put his team on his back and carry it toward a comeback, but he didn't receive nearly enough help.\n\nIn all, he scored 42 points and went 16-of-25 from the field, although he was 2-of-9 from downtown. Doncic also helped out with seven rebounds, eight assists and four steals.\n\nThis was a relatively quiet night for Vanderbilt. In 26 minutes, he got four rebounds, but he missed his three field-goal attempts and went scoreless.\n\nVincent went 3-of-6 overall and 3-of-5 from downtown, giving him nine points, plus one assist and one steal, in 18 minutes. He hit two of his treys early in the fourth quarter to try to jump-start a Lakers comeback, but to no avail.\n\nHayes was fairly aggressive and energetic throughout this contest. He got 19 minutes of playing time, and he made five of his six shot attempts to finish with 12 points, while also grabbing four offensive rebounds and five total boards.\n\nKnecht got onto the court for 13 minutes and hit two of his six shot attempts, including one 3-pointer. He finished with five points, two rebounds and one assist.\n\nThe younger James, Kleber and Smith each played only during the final 1:53 of this game. The younger James hit both of his shot attempts and scored six points, while Kleber and Smith went scoreless.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers player grades: L.A. gets steamrolled by Kings",

    "description": "The Texans rolled to an easy 30-6 win over the Steelers in their wild-card matchup on Monday night.",
    "fullText": "Mike Tomlin isn’t ready to talk about his future with the Pittsburgh Steelers just yet.\n\nAnd in the immediate aftermath of the team’s rough 30-6 loss to the Houston Texans in the wild-card round of the playoffs on Monday night, which officially ended their season, it’s hard to blame the longtime Steelers head coach.\n\n“I’m not even in that mindset as I sit here tonight,” Tomlin said when asked about his future with the team, via Yahoo Sports’ Jori Epstein. “I’m \n\nThere has been plenty of questions and speculation about Tomlin’s future in recent weeks as the Steelers had to fight their way into the final playoff spot in the AFC. While Tomlin has accomplished a remarkable amount in his nearly two decades leading the franchise, it’s easy to understand why.\n\nTomlin has never had a losing record in his 19 seasons running the Steelers, which marks his only head coaching job in the NFL. He helped them win a Super Bowl during the 2008 campaign, and he’s been to the playoffs now 13 times. Undoubtedly, he’ll retire as one of the better coaches in the history of the league whenever he chooses to do so.\n\nBut recently, especially after longtime quarterback Ben Roethlisberger retired, things have stalled out a bit in Pittsburgh. The organization has not won a playoff game since the 2017 season despite making it in five of the last six seasons.\n\nThe fact that some think Tomlin is on the “hot seat,” at least according to quarterback Aaron Rodgers — who may have played his last NFL game himself — is ridiculous.\n\nAaron Rodgers, when asked about Mike Tomlin, speaks on Tomlin and on #Packers head coach Matt LaFleur after the @Steelers’ playoff loss: pic.twitter.com/gTNmgQT6Qw\n\n— Jason Wilde (@jasonjwilde) January 13, 2026\n\n“This league has changed a lot in my 21 years. When you hear conversations about the Mike Tomlin’s of the world, the Matt LaFleur’s of the world … when I first got in the league there wouldn’t be conversations about whether those guys were on the hot seat,” Rodgers said, also referencing the Green Bay Packers head coach.\n\n“But the way the league is covered now and the way that there’s snap decisions and the validity given to the Twitter experts and all the experts on TV now who make it seem like they know what the hell they’re talking about, to me that’s an absolute joke.”\n\nTomlin has two years left on his current contract with the Steelers, and there is a team option on his deal for 2027. The Steelers, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, have to decide whether to pick up that option by March 1.\n\nAccording to Schefter, however, nobody within the organization expects the Steelers to actually fire Tomlin. The Steelers haven’t fired a head coach since 1968. When Tomlin and the Steelers fired offensive coordinator Matt Canada during the 2023 season, it was the first in-season coordinator change the franchise has had in more than 80 years. The franchise simply doesn’t make these types of changes.\n\nIf that’s the case, the Steelers will only have a new coach next season if Tomlin opts to walk away from the game himself. And that’s certainly a possibility.\n\nBut any talk about that, Tomlin said, will take place on Tuesday and beyond.\n\n“It’s not time for talk,” he said. “We agreed we’ll meet tomorrow and go from there. When you’re in this single elimination tournament, there's not a whole lot to talk about. You win or you go home.”",

    "title": "AI can now 'see' optical illusions. What does it tell us about our own brains?",
    "description": "Our eyes can frequently play tricks on us, but scientists have discovered that some artificial intelligence can fall for the same illusions.",
    "fullText": "Our eyes can frequently play tricks on us, but scientists have discovered that some artificial intelligence can fall for the same illusions. And it is changing what we know about our brains.\n\nWhen we look up at the Moon, it seems larger when it is close to the horizon compared to when it is higher up in the sky even though its size, and the distance between the Earth and the Moon, remains much the same during the course of a night.\n\nOptical illusions such as these show that we don't always perceive reality the way we should. They are often considered to be mistakes made by our visual system. But illusions also reveal the clever shortcuts our brains use to extract the most important details of our surroundings.\n\nIn truth, our brains only accept a sip of the world around us – it would be too much to process every detail of our busy visual environments, so instead they pick out only the details we need.\n\nBut what happens when you give a synthetic mind – a machine vision system powered by artificial intelligence – an optical illusion? These systems excel at detail. They are designed to spot the patterns and the blemishes we do not. It is why they have been so effective at spotting the early signs of diseases in medical scans, for example.\n\nYet, some deep neural networks (DNNs) – the technology that underpins many of today's advanced AI algorithms – are susceptible to some of the same visual tricks  as us humans. And it is providing new insights into how our own brains work.\n\n\"Using DNNs in illusion research allows us to simulate and analyse how the brain processes information and generates illusions,\" says Eiji Watanabe, an associate professor of neurophysiology at the National Institute for Basic Biology in Japan. \"Conducting experimental manipulations on the human brain raises serious ethical concerns but no such restrictions apply to artificial models.\"\n\nAlthough there are many theories about why we perceive different optical illusions, in most cases there still isn't a decisive explanation.\n\nStudying people who don't experience optical illusions has provided some clues. In one case, a person who lost his sight as a young child and had it restored in his 40s was not tricked by illusions involving shapes, such as the famous Kanizsa square, where four strategically positioned circular fragments create illusory contours that evoke a square. He could, however, perceive illusions of motion such as the barber pole, where stripes appear to move upwards even though the pole is simply turning on a vertical axis.\n\nStudies on cases such as this seem to suggest that our ability to perceive motion is more robust to sensory deprivation compared to making sense of shapes. This could be because we learn to process motion earlier on as infants. Alternatively, the way we process shapes could simply be more plastic and primed to recognise shapes we are exposed to the most.\n\nBrain-imaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have also provided insight into what parts of the brain are active when we see different illusions and how they interact. Our perception of optical illusions is subjective, however, and can differ between individuals, as illustrated by a photo of a striped dress that went viral online in 2015, where viewers couldn't agree on whether it was blue and black or white and gold. This makes it hard to study them objectively since researchers typically depend on participants describing what they see.\n\nNow, AI is offering a new way of understanding what is going on in our brains when we look at optical illusions.\n\nMany of the AI algorithms in use today – including chatbots such as ChatGPT – are powered by deep neural networks, which are models made up of artificial neurons that attempt to mimic how our brain processes information.\n\nIn recent work, Watanabe and his colleagues wanted to see whether a deep neural network could replicate what happens in our own brains when we look at illusions involving motion, such as the rotating snakes illusion. This uses a trippy pattern of colourful circles in a static image but appears to be rotating when we stare at it.\n\nWatanabe and his team used a deep neural network called PredNet, which was designed based on a leading theory about how our brains deal with visual information called predictive coding. It suggests that our visual system doesn't just passively process features in our surroundings when we look around. Instead, it first predicts what it expects to see by drawing on past experience before it processes discrepancies in the input from our eyes. This allows us to see more quickly.\n\nSimilarly, PredNet predicts future frames in a video based on knowledge it acquires from previous frames it has seen. For his experiment, Watanabe trained the AI using videos of natural landscapes captured by head-mounted cameras which were similar to what humans might see when looking around. The system was never exposed to any optical illusions. By showing it certain frames it hadn't seen, it was designed to make its prediction match the frame as closely as possible.\n\n\"After processing around a million frames, PredNet learns certain rules of the visual world,\" says Watanabe. \"It extracts and remembers the essential rules and among these, it may have also learned characteristics of moving objects.\"\n\nWatanabe then presented the AI model with a few variations of the rotating snakes illusion and an altered version that human brains are not fooled by, and so perceive as static. He found that the AI was tricked by the same images as humans. Watanabe thinks it supports the theory that our brains use predictive coding. In this case there are aspects of the images that are indicative of moving objects that trigger our brain's prediction system into assuming the multicoloured snakes are in motion.\n\n\"I think PredNet's perception is similar to human perception,\" he says.\n\nHowever, Watanabe and his team also found differences between how the AI and humans perceive the illusion. When we fix our gaze on one of the rotating circles, for example, it seems to stop turning whereas the other discs in our peripheral vision continue to spin. PredNet, however, always perceives all the circles moving at the same time.\n\n\"This is likely because PredNet lacks an attention mechanism,\" says Watanabe. This means it is unable to focus on a specific spot on the image, but processes it in its entirety.\n\nAlthough AI systems and robots may be able to mimic certain aspects of our visual system, they are still far off from being able to see the world as we do. So far, there is no deep neural network that can experience all the illusions that humans do, says Watanabe.\n\nIn some ways this shouldn't surprise us.\n\n\"ChatGPT, for example, might seem to converse like a human but its underlying DNN functions very differently from the human brain,\" says Watanabe. \"The key similarity is that both systems use [some type of] neurons but how they are structured and applied can be vastly different.\"\n\n• What puzzles reveal about our own minds\n\n• We built a nasty game to test AI's ability to apologise\n\n• What happens when an AI takes an inkblot test?\n\nSome researchers are trying to combine AI with the weirdness of quantum mechanics to better simulate how humans perceive certain illusions.\n\nPreviously, researchers have used concepts from quantum mechanics to explain our perception of the Necker cube, a famous ambiguous figure illusion where a cube appears to randomly switch between two different orientations.\n\nClassical theories of physics would predict that the cube should be perceived in one way or another. But in quantum mechanics, the cube could be in two states at once until our brain chose to perceive one. Think of the famous Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, where a cat trapped in a box with a mechanism that could kill it is both dead and alive until someone looks inside.\n\nInspired by this work, Ivan Maksymov, a research fellow at Charles Sturt University's Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Futures Institute in Bathurst, Australia, developed a model that combined quantum physics with AI to see if it could simulate the way we perceive the Necker cube and a similar illusion called Rubin vase, where we see either a vase or two faces in profile. He designed a deep neural network that processes information using a phenomenon called quantum tunnelling. The system was then trained to recognise the two illusions.\n\nWhen one of the illusions was input into the system, it would generate one of the two interpretations. Maksymov found that the AI would regularly switch between each of them over time – much as humans do. The time intervals of these switches were similar too.\n\n\"It's quite close to what people see in tests,\" he says.\n\nMaksymov doesn't think this suggests that our brain has quantum properties, although it is an active field of research. Instead, he thinks that it shows that certain aspects of human thought, such as how we make decisions, can be better modelled by using quantum theory, the basis of a field called quantum cognition. With the illusions, our brain is choosing one version or the other, for example.\n\nSuch a system could also be used to simulate how our visual perception may change in space under different gravitational conditions. Researchers have previously studied how astronauts who have spent time on the International Space Station (ISS) experience changes in the way they see optical illusions.\n\nThey found that astronauts will see illusions such as the Necker Cube more often in one of its two perspectives when on Earth. But after three months in orbit, they saw each one perspective equally as often. Scientists believe this may occur because some of how we judge depth relies upon gravity. When free-floating in orbit, an astronaut cannot estimate distance based on how high their eyes are from the ground when sitting or standing upright.\n\n\"While it's a narrow field of research, it's quite important because humans want to go to space,\" says Maksymov.\n\nAnd with all the wonders the Universe holds, those space travellers will definitely want to know they can believe their eyes.\n\nFor more technology news and insights, \n\nFor more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC,",

    "fullText": "Saving for retirement is pointless thanks to the impending “supersonic tsunami” of AI and robotics, which will bring about a world of zero scarcity, according to Elon Musk.\n\nWhile the Tesla and SpaceX CEO admitted he’s “more optimistic” than most, he insisted people shouldn’t stress over building a nest egg for the distant future, contrary to the staid advice of nearly all other financial professionals.\n\n“Don’t worry about squirreling money away for retirement in 10 or 20 years,” said the world’s richest man on the Moonshots with Peter Diamandis podcast last week. “It won’t matter.”\n\nPart of Musk’s controversial take lies in his vision of a world transformed by rapidly improving AI, robotics, and energy technology.\n\n“Anything short of shaping atoms, AI can do probably half or more of those jobs right now,” he said.\n\nThe advances could lead to such big productivity increases, he said, that they will surpass “what people possibly could think of as abundance.”\n\nRather than a universal income, everyone will enjoy a “universal ‘you can have whatever you want’ income” in the future, he claimed. In this world, the link between individual wages, savings, and living standards no longer makes sense.\n\nEven without savings, AI will help people obtain better medical care than currently available within five years, as well as remove any limit on the availability of goods, services, or educational opportunities.\n\n​Musk’s comments build on his earlier claims that AI and humanoid robots will make work “optional” within 10 to 20 years and render money itself irrelevant. Musk previously compared the future of work to leisure activities like playing sports or video games rather than a survival necessity.\n\n“If you want to work, [it’s] the same way you can go to the store and just buy some vegetables, or you can grow vegetables in your backyard. It’s much harder to grow vegetables in your backyard, and some people still do it because they like growing vegetables,” Musk said during the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in November.\n\n​To be sure, Musk’s predictions about the future come at a time where many Americans are struggling to save. In part due to persistent inflation and weak wage growth, only 55% of American adults said they had a “rainy day” fund of three months expenses saved up for an emergency, down from a high of 59% in 2021, according to a survey by the Federal Reserve. Fewer than half of those surveyed said they could cover an expense of $2,000 or more with their savings.",

    "description": "Gold and silver surge to historic highs as the dollar weakens. A structural shift in safe-haven demand & global monetary confidence?",
    "fullText": "As geopolitical tensions rise, the US dollar (USD), long considered the market’s default safe haven, is failing to respond in the way it has historically.\n\nMeanwhile, gold (XAU) and silver (XAG) are flashing signals that extend far beyond a typical commodities rally.\n\nInstead, capital is flowing decisively into hard assets, pushing gold toward the $5,000 mark and silver above $80, levels that are forcing investors to reassess old macro assumptions.\n\nGold stock analyst Garrett Goggin highlighted the anomaly, noting that during previous US military escalations, the dollar almost always strengthened as investors rushed toward perceived safety. This time, the opposite occurred.\n\n“The USD used to spike higher when the bombs dropped. Not anymore,” Goggin said, pointing to a sharp dollar pullback even as gold and silver surged.\n\nIndeed, while gold and silver prices recorded God Candles on Monday, the US dollar index nosedived, dipping to 98.53 as of this writing. The divergence suggests growing skepticism toward the dollar’s role as a geopolitical hedge.\n\nThe price action itself is historic. Economist and long-time precious metals advocate Peter Schiff noted that gold has cleared $4,560 for the first time ever, placing it closer to $5,000 than $4,000.\n\nSilver, meanwhile, has jumped above $84, posting one of its strongest relative performances in decades. The simultaneous breakout across both metals is unusual and typically associated with periods of deep monetary or systemic stress.\n\nAnalysts argue that silver’s move is not being driven solely by speculative frenzy. Synnax co-founder and COO Dario pointed to silver entering contango—a condition where futures prices trade above spot prices—as a potential signal that large corporate and industrial buyers are entering the market.\n\nAccording to Dario, this behavior suggests companies are hedging against future supply shortages and rising costs. It indicates real-economy demand rather than short-term trading excess.\n\nThe rally has also revived long-standing debates around price suppression in precious metals markets. Kip Herriage argues that gold and silver were artificially restrained for years, citing JPMorgan’s 2020 manipulation fine as a key inflection point.",

    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA diver just stumbled upon a bounty of ancient coins off the coast of Italy.\n\nCultural ministers believe the that find could point toward an unknown lost shipwreck in the region.\n\nThe bronze and copper coins were originally minted in Rome.\n\nA diver stumbled across the find of a lifetime off the coast of Sardinia when a stray shiny item loosened itself from the sea grass below. That metallic sheen turned out to herald a bounty of more than 30,000 bronze and copper coins minted in Rome during the fourth century.\n\n“The treasure found in the waters of Arzachena represents one of the most important discoveries of numismatic finds in recent years,” Luigi La Rocca, director general of archaeology, fine arts, and landscape for the region, says in a translated statement from the Italian culture ministry.\n\nNear the town of Arzachena, divers were trawling an area of sandy clearing near the beach that was also surrounded by seagrass. That one coin soon yielded tens of thousands of others, all in an “excellent and rare state of preservation” and dating back to between 324 and 340 AD. The ministry says that, thanks to the weight of the coins, there could be at least 30,000 of them and as many as 50,000. That would make this one of the largest ancient coin finds in the past few decades.\n\nAnd, if we’re lucky, it may even point to a completely undiscovered hidden shipwreck.\n\nThe underwater makeup of the region has the potential to preserve a lost shipwreck, which could explain the finding of so many coins in one spot. While there is no news yet of a wreck being found, experts remain hopeful that one could turn up after further investigation.\n\nRight now, we will have to content ourselves with the excitement of the huge bounty of coins discovered littering the seafloor. The follis coins—found in both bronze and copper—were used first by the Romans and then later by the Byzantine Empire.\n\nWhen the divers first saw the coins, they contacted authorities and art protection squad drivers joined with the ministry’s undersea archaeology department, firefighter divers, and border police divers to dig into the area. Alongside the coins, the divers also located walls of narrow-necked jugs with two handles, which also helped point experts towards the idea that a shipwreck may be nearby.\n\n“(The finding) highlights the richness and importance of the archaeological heritage that our seabed, traversed by men and goods since the earliest times, still guards and preserves,” La Rocca said.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Contrary to a common assumption, the tobacco industry isn’t exactly imploding. There’s still money to be made here.\n\nThe oil and gas business also has far more life ahead of it than once expected.\n\nPharmaceutical giant Merck’s breadwinning oncology drug Keytruda may be nearing the end of its reign, but the company’s still got something to offer patient investors.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Merck ›\n\nMost of the time, making a decision about a particular stock is best done through a \"forever\" lens. That's especially true for dividend stocks, which require their underlying companies to boast cash flows with clear longevity.\n\nEvery now and then though, a dividend stock surfaces that's compelling but not necessarily built to be a permanent addition to your portfolio. Think of it as leasing rather than buying a car, or renting rather than purchasing a home. Sometimes, this short-term choice makes the most financial sense in the long run.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of three dividend stocks to buy with plans to only hold them for the next 10 years, at which time you'll want to reassess whether or not you want to stick with any of them.\n\nThere's no denying that the tobacco business is dying thanks to successful smoking-cessation efforts. But it's not dying nearly as quickly as you might think. A 2024 outlook from the World Health Organization suggests the total number of worldwide tobacco users is only expected to fall from 2000's 1.36 billion to just under 1.2 billion by 2030; global population growth is helping the industry remain afloat.\n\nThe tobacco business's eventual end is still inevitable, of course. But there's good money to be made in it now and into the foreseeable future.\n\nEnter Altria Group (NYSE: MO), parent to Philip Morris USA, which owns popular cigarette brands like Marlboro, Virginia Slims, and of course its namesake brand Philip Morris. Although its revenue has been slowly dwindling since 2021, profits haven't, and that's the metric that income-minded investors are far more concerned about. After all, profits ultimately support its dividend payment, which currently translates into a forward-looking yield of nearly 7.8%. You'd be hard-pressed to find better from a blue chip company with a similar risk profile. Indeed, that's better than most bond yields at this time, without requiring a great deal more risk.\n\nBut why just 10 years? Given the World Health Organization's projections, can't Altria keep itself -- and its dividend -- on life support well beyond 2036? Possibly. Maybe even probably.",

    "fullText": "Jan 12 (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustdar said on Monday as many as 1.5 million patients in the U.S. may be ​using compounded versions of blockbuster GLP-1 drugs, underscoring how cheaper, unapproved ‌alternatives have captured a significant share of demand for obesity treatments.\n\nSpeaking on a panel at the ‌J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, Doustdar said compounders understood consumer needs better than the pharmaceutical industry initially did, allowing them to attract patients who were unable or unwilling to pay for branded medicines.\n\nNovo, the maker of the obesity drug Wegovy, has ⁠repeatedly warned about the risks ‌of compounded and knock-off versions of GLP-1 medicines, often sold online and marketed directly to consumers.\n\nDoustdar said many patients were ‍likely drawn to compounded GLP-1s priced around $199 per month, compared with branded products that can cost several hundred dollars without insurance coverage.\n\n\"It's not because this one-and-a-half million patients like ​to have unsafe, knock-off versions of our products... they (compounders) grabbed a part ‌of the consumers that simply were price sensitive to the whole thing.\"\n\nEarlier in January, Novo launched a daily oral version of Wegovy in the U.S. at a starting cash price of $149 per month, hoping to attract consumers who cannot get insurance coverage and revive its fortunes in the competitive weight-loss market.\n\nDoustdar, however, ⁠said the company distinguishes between legitimate online ​pharmacies and telehealth providers, which it supports, and ​a separate group of sellers offering counterfeit products.\n\n\"There is this surprising element of a group of companies being able to pass ‍FDA, come and sell ⁠unsafe, knock-off products in this market,\" he said, adding that Novo continues to fight against such practices.\n\nHe said the shift toward compounded drugs, ⁠essentially copies of the name-brand drugs, was a key learning for Novo as it reassesses pricing ‌and access strategies for its obesity treatments.",

    "fullText": "I grew up on the shores of Lake Erie, in a town just south of Buffalo, New York. Ice was something we chiseled off a car in winter, not something that's dropped into a drink. For me, life on a tropical island was a pipe dream.\n\nIn high school, I was the geeky kid, always excited to read stories in Time and The New York Times about exotic, far-off places. I knew early on that I wanted a job that would allow me to experience global events firsthand.\n\nA semester abroad in France cemented my ambition. I lived with a family who also rented to an American expat. He talked casually about his Swiss ski holidays, escapes to Greece and Turkey, and his favorite cafés in Paris.\n\nI already knew then, at 21, that was the life I wanted. Why work in \"boring\" New York or Chicago when I could aim for Paris, Hong Kong, or London?\n\nAfter working as an editor in New York City for several years, my then-wife got offered a job in Singapore. It was the golden opportunity we both wanted. What we thought would be a posting of just a few years turned into decades. We divorced in 2011, but both stayed in Singapore, building our careers and lives.\n\nI'd always wanted to be a photojournalist, so in 2000 I decided to pursue it full-time. My location made me a standout. Asia was entering a travel boom, and magazine editors needed photographers on the ground. To paraphrase the cliché: I was in the right place at the perfect moment.\n\nI've shot for National Geographic Traveler across Australia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and India — Singapore was the perfect base. I could be ready to go anywhere in Southeast Asia with just a few hours' notice.\n\nMy photography career eventually gave way to something more permanent and corporate, although still rooted in Singapore. I became a content director, producing and directing videos across the region.\n\nIt was a natural evolution for a writer-photographer in a world rapidly shifting to digital content.\n\nBut it has come with a cost. My mother grew older, got sick, moved into a managed care facility, and then passed away suddenly.\n\nI made every effort to visit twice a year, especially in the summer and around Christmas. But there was always a tinge of guilt and remorse that I wasn't there more.\n\nOn one of my last trips back before she died, I remember her saying, \"Haven't you been in Singapore long enough?\" She was always supportive of my choices, but as she approached 80, and her health declined, she wanted me closer to home.\n\nShe was getting the care she needed in the nursing home, but there was no substitute for a visit from me, my presence — complete with stories about my life overseas.\n\nWas I selfish? Perhaps, but I also would never trade the life I have.\n\nProbably, although I'm not sure, because everything is different. I remarried three years ago. I have a 9-year-old daughter from a previous marriage and a toddler son with my wife, Jamie. Both kids have US passports and deserve an American identity and a place to put down roots. They've been to the US to meet their cousins and my oldest friends, but have never had the chance to live there or fully experience life as Americans.\n\nRecently, I told my daughter that she'd visited Manhattan when she was a toddler. Her response: \"Where is that?\" It was a stark realization.\n\nThey should know the country that shaped who I am.\n\nWould I recommend an expat life to someone? Absolutely. I got the life I dreamed of. And despite the challenges and distance, it gave me everything I hoped for when I was that kid, growing up near Buffalo, reading about the rest of the world.\n\nDo you have a story to share about living abroad?

    "fullText": "At least 20 people have been killed by a wild elephant in nine days in the eastern Indian state of Jharkhand, officials have said, adding that the animal is yet to be captured.\n\nThe deaths occurred between 1 and 9 January in the Chaibasa and Kolhan forest areas of West Singhbhum district, which are part of one of the largest Sal forests in Asia.\n\nHuman-elephant conflict has been reported in the region for years, with officials and researchers linking it to shrinking forest cover, habitat fragmentation and increased human activity near elephant corridors.\n\nA massive search operation involving more than 100 forest personnel is under way to locate the elephant, officials say.\n\n\"This is an unprecedented situation. It's the first time such a pattern of fatalities has been linked to a single male elephant in the region,\" said divisional forest officer Kuldeep Meena, adding that the entire area had been put on high alert to prevent further loss of life and property.\n\nTheir immediate priority, he said, was to trace, capture and safely return the animal into the wild.\n\nDistrict magistrate Chandan Kumar told the BBC that a forest worker is among the 20 people who have died. Authorites have announced monetary compensation for their families.\n\nMost of the deaths occurred at night, when residents were guarding paddy stored in fields and barns - a common practice in rural India.\n\nOne of the victims, 34-year-old Mangal Singh Hembram, was attacked near his home in Bodijari village while returning from work, officials said.\n\nIn Birsingh Hatu village, 62-year-old Urdub Bahoda was killed while watching over his field, according to his family. Later the same night, Vishnu Sundi, 42, from a neighbouring village was trampled to death while sleeping outside his house, his son said.\n\nIn another incident on 5 January, Kundra Bahoda and his two children - six-year-old Kodama and eight-year-old Samu - were killed by the elephant. Kundra's wife, Pundi, said she escaped with her injured two-year-old daughter and found out only later that her husband and two older children had died.\n\nForest officials said the elephant was young, agile and frequently changed its location, particularly at night, making it difficult to track. Teams have been using traditional drum alerts to warn residents and advising people not to go outdoors or sleep outside at night.\n\nMeena said a preliminary assessment suggested the animal could be in its mating phase when male elephants experience heightened aggression due to increased testosterone levels. Officials said such behaviour usually subsides within 15 to 20 days.\n\nThey also said the elephant may have strayed from its herd, underlining the need to locate it and allow it to rejoin other elephants in the forest.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

    "description": "\"I have become indifferent to food. I still love it. I still love it. But I'm not in any way obsessed about it,\" Oprah Winfrey said.",
    "fullText": "Oprah Winfrey, 71, says growing older has made her more appreciative of her health, especially after using GLP-1s to manage obesity.\n\nIn an interview with CBS Sunday Morning, Winfrey spoke about how learning that obesity is a disease helped her stop seeing her weight as a personal failure.\n\n\"I'm not going to, but I could weep right now for all of the many days and nights I've journaled about this being my fault and why can't I conquer this thing?\" Winfrey told host Jane Pauley.\n\nWinfrey said the \"food noise\" in her head went away within hours on the first day she took a GLP-1 medication.\n\n\"There are tools to use that can help you. And I do see it as a tool,\" she said.\n\n\"I have become indifferent to food. I still love it. I still love it. But I'm not in any way obsessed about it,\" she said.\n\nWinfrey added that she's come to see the medication as something she needs to continue taking to manage obesity. If anything, she wishes she had known about it earlier.\n\n\"I have regret that I didn't discover it in 2013. I have regret that, oh my gosh, this has been going on for over 12 years now, and I didn't know about it,\" she said.\n\n\"I think about the wasted time. The wasted time, the wasted sadness and shame about it. I think about the wasted years,\" Winfrey said.\n\nStill, Winfrey said she has a new appreciation for her health and how she feels in her body today.\n\n\"I am just happy. This is what I feel. I feel that when I was 40 and ran a marathon, I certainly could appreciate the strength that it took to do that and the work that it took to get into that shape,\" she said. \"But there's something about being 71 that gives you a perspective and the long view of appreciation that's unlike any other time in your life.\"\n\nWinfrey added that while she felt good at 40, being strong and healthy at 71 has been much more meaningful.\n\n\"Because what it takes to be in the best shape of your life when you're 71 is a whole lot more than when you're 40,\" she added.\n\nHer lifelong struggles with weight have led her to recognize the value of having treatment options today.\n\n\"I have a sense of gratitude that I was able to live in a time where these medications were made available to people to change their lives,\" she said.\n\nWinfrey first revealed that she was using a type of GLP-1 medication in December 2023, but didn't disclose which one.\n\nIn December 2025, Winfrey told People that she went off the medication for a year because she wanted to prove that she could \"do without it,\" but ended up gaining 20 pounds.\n\n\"It's going to be a lifetime thing. I'm on high blood pressure medication, and if I go off the high blood pressure medication, my blood pressure is going to go up. The same thing is true now, I realize, with these medications. I've proven to myself I need it,\" Winfrey said.\n\nGLP-1 drugs, such as semaglutide, work by regulating hunger signals, allowing people to feel full while consuming less. However, these drugs can cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea and diarrhoea. Research has also shown that it is not uncommon for patients to regain the weight after stopping treatment.",

As of 2026, at least one data center under the project is already underway in Texas.\n\nSuch buildouts are energy-intensive. OpenAI's data center plans will cost $400 billion and require seven gigawatts of power, Business Insider previously wrote, more than that of the entire New York City.\n\nSome tech companies are also moving their planned facilities off the grid entirely for easier permitting and less community resistance. To shield residents and small businesses from rate hikes, utilities in states like Indiana and Ohio have also started enforcing tariffs on power-hungry tech facilities.",

    "fullText": "Ukrainian troops appear to be testing a new drone attachment that uses a cord or line to disable enemy propeller drones in the sky.\n\nThe tactic can be seen in a video posted on Monday by the 46th Separate Air Mobile Brigade, which published a video montage of its recent attacks against Russian infantry, vehicles, and drones.\n\nIn a caption, the brigade highlighted a \"new way of capture of enemy drones in the air.\"\n\nAs seen from the first-person-view camera of the Ukrainian drone, the new contraption features a rod protruding from the interceptor's chassis.\n\nThin rope or cord dangles from the rod, pulled taut by a small weight that sways into view as the Ukrainian drone flies high above the battlefield.\n\nThe brigade's drone then appears to fly over its target — a small quadcopter — entangling the opposing device's propellers with the attached line.\n\nThe brigade published footage of two such interceptions, as well as a third clip of a drone with the rod-like attachment attempting to crash into a fixed-wing drone.\n\nThe third target was likely a Russian Molniya one-way attack loitering munition. It's unclear if the interception in the third clip was successful.\n\nThe novel, fishing rod-style device is another example of how the war is pushing militaries to develop new methods of physically disrupting drones as electronic warfare technology adapts.\n\nUkrainians and Russians have been experimenting with similar counterdrone tactics as a response to anti-jamming features on small attack drones, deploying fishing nets both on the ground and testing them on interceptors.\n\nSome Western companies have also begun trialing drone-mounted and handheld net launchers as a defense against small quadcopters.\n\nAs Russia increasingly relies on large-scale attacks with fixed-wing Geran drones that typically fly at speeds of up to 115 mph, and in some cases even 230 mph, the war has led to the growing popularity of small, fast, and inexpensive drones acting as interceptors.\n\nThe 46th Separate Air Mobile Brigade's fishing line apparatus, however, appears to be more suited to disabling quadcopters.",

    "description": "An app asking \"Are you dead?\" has gone viral in China, sparking debate about loneliness and the risks of living alone.",
    "fullText": "An app that asks a blunt question — \"Are you dead?\" — has become a hit in China.\n\nThe app, called \"Si Le Me\" (Chinese for \"are you dead\"), requires users to \"check in\" by pressing a button. If they fail to do so for two consecutive days, the app alerts an emergency contact.\n\nDesigned for people living alone, \"Si Le Me\" has surged to become the most popular paid download on China's Apple App Store this week. It costs 8 yuan, or $1.15, to download. The app was launched in mid-2025, but its downloads only surged in early January, according to Chinese media reports.\n\nIts stark, literal name has struck a nerve on Chinese social media, triggering raw discussions about loneliness and the risks of living alone.\n\nSolo living is becoming increasingly common in China, among both young city dwellers and the growing population of old people living independently.\n\nChina could have as many as 200 million one-person households by 2030, with more than 30% of people living alone, according to projections published in 2021 by Beike Research Institute, a real-estate research firm.\n\nA government survey in 2021 found that nearly 60% of Chinese age 60 and above lived alone or only with a spouse, up about 10 percentage points from 2010.\n\nOne of the app's creators told Chinese media the idea grew out of online conversations about safety and isolation among people living alone. The three co-creators were all born in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe app's sudden rise has sparked a wave of discussion on Chinese social media, with users interpreting its popularity as a symptom of deeper loneliness.\n\nA user who goes by Qian Wei said in their post on RedNote on Monday that they \"sense a deep loneliness\" behind the app's success.\n\nFor much of China's history, kinship formed the basic unit of society, but \"this structure has completely collapsed\" in the present day, they wrote.\n\n\"In big cities, everyone is an isolated, atomized individual. People live in soundproof apartments, not knowing the surname of their neighbors,\" they wrote in their post.\n\n\"This creates an extremely intense fear, which is commonly known as 'lonely death,'\" they added.\n\nOther RedNote users echoed the sentiment, describing the app's popularity as a collective \"cry of loneliness.\"\n\nAnother user who goes by Huang Mu Xin Sheng wrote on RedNote on Tuesday that the app made them feel \"extremely uneasy\" because it reduces existence itself to a functional task.\n\nThe app has also stirred debate over its stark name. Some users referred to it as inauspicious, likening it to a curse and urging the creators to rename it. Others said they were willing to pay 8 yuan for peace of mind.\n\nNot all reactions were somber. One RedNote user described the app as a form of \"meme-style stress relief,\" a lighthearted way for young people to cope with mounting pressure.\n\nAnother user framed the app as a source of certainty in an era when life feels increasingly out of control.\n\n\"I check in, therefore I am,\" they wrote.",

    "fullText": "David Moss, 28, has been a Tesla owner since March 2024.\n\nMoss said Tesla's Full Self-Driving (Supervised) was the number one purchase driver.\n\nHe says he has traveled more than 11,000 miles across the US without touching the steering wheel.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with David Moss, 28, a resident of Puyallup, Washington, who has been documenting his experience with Full Self-Driving (Supervised), Tesla's advanced driver assistance system. Moss told Business Insider that he does not own Tesla stock.\n\nBusiness Insider verified Moss's travel logs, charging stops, and FSD mileage data that is displayed on his car. Tesla only displays FSD usage down to the 10th of a mile.\n\nI've owned a Tesla since March 2024.\n\nTesla's Full Self-Driving feature was the primary reason I made the purchase. I would say the electric aspect is almost an inconvenience, and FSD is my main interest in the Tesla.\n\nCharging around my hometown isn't a pain. There's a station near my house, and I have a charger at home.\n\nHowever, my commutes are long. I'm a product manager for a company that makes 3D lidar scanners, and a lot of my job is visiting clients on-site all around America.\n\nI drive over 50,000 miles a year. Given the number of miles I drive, an electric car is a slower form of transportation than a gas car.\n\nMy first Tesla was a Cybertruck, but unfortunately, I totaled it in August while I was driving it in off-road mode. In September, I bought the long-range Model 3. The company was running a promotion where if you bought a Model 3 before the tax credit expired, you got a free year of charging.\n\nSince then, I've put over 23,000 miles on the car. So I've been making good use of the free electricity.\n\nI began a road trip on October 28 and have since driven 18,741 miles.\n\nAround November 25, while I was in Raleigh, North Carolina, I got the FSD version 14.2 update and have driven over 11,000 miles without any intervention as of December 31.\n\nWhen I say no intervention, I mean down to the 10th of a mile — 100% no steering wheel or pedal touches. That includes parking and getting into a charging station.\n\nFSD navigated restaurants, supercharger stations, office complexes — every single part of the drive.\n\nDuring the trip, I've gone down several dirt roads and construction zones that had cones, reroutes, and road closures. One morning, I was in Reno, leaving my hotel, and the normal road was closed for construction. The car immediately turned around and found an alternative route.\n\nOne of the more interesting cases was in Wyoming during a severe windstorm.\n\nThere were alerts, warning of 80 mph winds. In about a hundred-mile stretch, I saw six different tipped-over semi-trucks.\n\nI was a little nervous about driving on the freeway with high-wind caution alerts, but FSD handled everything while I was on Interstate 80, traveling from Cheyenne to Evanston. FSD drove without even touching a lane marker once.\n\nI think in that situation, FSD shone more than usual.\n\nSince Raleigh, I've traveled across the country — down to Miami, across Texas, through the Rockies, and up to Medford, Oregon.\n\nAfter a two-day pit stop back in my hometown in Washington for Christmas Eve, I headed to Los Angeles and drove across the US until I hit South Carolina.\n\nI put on a lot of audiobooks and podcasts while FSD drives. I also took business calls or calls with friends and family.\n\nI haven't tested out being on my phone with my eyes off the road. That's still against the law, and it's just not worth the risk.\n\nI've never dozed off during the drive, but I'm also not constantly on the edge of my seat or grimacing while FSD is on.\n\nI'm a million times less scared than I've ever been in an Uber ride or with most of my friends. If I had to sum it up in one sentence, I'd say it's the most pleasant driving I've experienced.\n\nWhen I started my road trip on October 28, my Tesla was on FSD version 13.2.9.\n\nEventually, when I was in the southern part of Alberta in Canada, I installed version 14.1. That was around the evening of November 5. Around November 25, I got 14.2.\n\nI have a Starlink Mini mounted underneath my Tesla's glass roof, allowing me to download updates remotely and install them while I sleep in my hotel room.\n\nI wouldn't call the difference between 14.1 and 14.2 a grand night-and-day difference, but there's definitely been a noticeable improvement under version 14: the ability to park, more speed profiles like \"Sloth\" and \"Mad Max\" mode, and just the overall smoothness.\n\nFor the first time, with 14.2, I was able to win people over when I showed FSD to my friends and family. Before they were like, \"Oh, that's kind of cool,\" \"It's a gimmick,\" or \"I'm not going to buy this.\" Now, they're saying, \"Oh wow, I actually need that.\"\n\nI can't speak enough about how much I love FSD and how much it inconveniences me to drive.\n\nA lot of the driving I currently do is simply because I don't want to fly. Because I know that when I arrive at the airport, I'm likely not going to be able to rent a car with FSD.\n\nThe record-setting was never really the focus.\n\nI didn't even check the FSD stat page for several hundred miles before I started seeing people post about it online, saying, \"Oh wow, I've actually not touched the wheel at all.\"\n\nAt this point, a technology like FSD is indispensable to having a car. The feature provides me with peace of mind, having that \"extra set of eyes\" on the road.\n\nThere's also a personal side to that because my father is legally blind and can't operate a vehicle. If there were one day an unsupervised Cybercab that he could buy, we'd buy it on day one.\n\nMy father's ecstatic. He believes he's one day closer to gaining his independence.",

    "fullText": "YoungHoon Kim, who claims an IQ of 276, is calling XRP a “super cycle.”\n\nKim has been vocal about XRP in recent months, predicting it could outperform gold and silver in 2026.\n\nRipple has secured key regulatory approvals from the U.K.’s FCA.\n\nThe self-proclaimed “world’s smartest man,” YoungHoon Kim, is again spreading bullish predictions for XRP, saying the token has entered a “super cycle.”\n\nKim’s comments come as Ripple, the blockchain payments company behind the token, announced an expansion of its cross-border payment services to the U.K.\n\nKim, who claims an IQ of 276, made the comments in a series of posts on X, including a statement that “XRP is in a super cycle.”\n\nIn a previous post, Kim wrote that “it’s time for XRP. From now on.”\n\nA “super cycle” refers to an extended period of strong upward momentum that significantly outpaces normal market growth, often driven by macroeconomic trends.\n\nThe notion of a crypto “super cycle” has gained traction among prominent market figures in recent months.\n\nThis term has been mentioned by Fundstrat and Bitmine’s co-founder Tom Lee, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood, and most recently Binance founder Changpeng Zhao.\n\nIn response to the SEC removing crypto from 2026 priority risk list, CZ wrote: “I could be wrong, but Super Cycle incoming.”\n\nTom Lee said in November that he believed Ethereum was embarking on the same super cycle as Bitcoin from 2017.\n\n“The path higher is not a straight line,” he wrote on X.\n\nKim has been increasingly vocal about XRP’s potential.\n\nEarlier this month, he wrote that the cryptocurrency may outperform precious metals in 2026, noting, “My prediction: XRP may outperform gold and silver in 2026.”\n\nHe added that while gold and silver were currently “pumping,” XRP would be “next.”\n\nThe comments mark a shift from Kim’s prior focus on Bitcoin, with whom he had previously engaged in frequent comparisons.\n\nHe has also suggested that XRP could approach $1,000 over the next decade under certain macroeconomic scenarios, citing a potential decline in the U.S. dollar and sustained inflation.\n\nThe predictions come as Ripple announced a significant regulatory milestone, obtaining approval for its Electronic Money Institution (EMI) licence and crypto asset registration from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\n\nThe new approvals allow Ripple to extend its licenced cross-border payments platform to U.K. institutions, enabling them to send international payments using digital assets efficiently.",

    "title": "Not The 4Runner, Not The Highlander – The Longest-Lasting Toyota SUV, According To iSeeCars",
    "description": "Toyota has a reputation for making reliable vehicles, but if you're looking for a reliable Toyota SUV, it may not be the model you're thinking of.",
    "fullText": "The team at iSeeCars, a website for selling and purchasing new and used cars, has put together a list of the 25 longest-lasting vehicles. The vehicles that made the list are the most likely to reach 250,000 miles and beyond. Toyota Motor Corporation, which includes Toyota and Lexus, dominates the list with nine of the top 10 vehicles. Toyota alone has 10 models in the top 25.\n\nKarl Brauer, Executive Analyst of iSeeCars, said that \"The 2025 iSeeCars Longest-Lasting Cars list features vehicles with between a 9.1% and 39.1% predicted chance of reaching 250,000 miles.\" What may be considered surprising on the list is the number of SUVs, having earned 11 of the top 25 positions on the list. According to iSeeCars, the industry average for a car reaching 250,000 miles is just 4.8%. That means the vehicle at the 25 spot, the Acura MDX, may just have a 9.1% chance to reach 250,000 miles, even if it's still double the average.\n\nThe vehicle at the top of the list is the Toyota Sequoia, which has a 39.1% chance of lasting more than 250,000 miles. That means the Sequoia is 8.1 times more likely to surpass 250,000 miles than the average vehicle.\n\nToyota has historically proven itself to be one of the safest and most reliable vehicle brands in the world. In fact, looking through the history of our most reliable vehicle brand rankings, Toyota is consistently at the top of the list. Lexus, the luxury arm of Toyota's vehicle business, is also consistently at the top. This reliability goes beyond just the brand's new cars, as it applies to the used models as well. A 2024 Consumer Reports study determined that Lexus and Toyota were the two most reliable used car brands.\n\nThere are a multitude of reasons why Toyota vehicles are so reliable, from their quality management and production systems to utilizing the ideas of Dr. W. Edwards Deming. Dr. Deming helped improve the efficiency of Toyota manufacturing plants in the 1950s, helping turn Toyota into the global leader it is today.\n\nThe Toyota Sequoia itself is a reliable and safe SUV. While it doesn't have a safety score from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, it does earn top scores of Good from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The Sequoia consistently earns average to above-average reliability ratings from reviewers such as J.D. Power and Consumer Reports.\n\nAfter receiving a complete redesign for the 2023 model year, the Toyota Sequoia pushes the envelope for premium off-road-ready SUVs. The 2026 Sequoia is powered by a 3.4-liter V6 engine mated to an electric motor for a combined output of 437 horsepower and 583 pound-feet of torque. The hybrid components will help save you fuel during long drives, and the nearly 600 pound-feet of torque will give you plenty of power off-road.\n\nRear-wheel drive comes standard on the Sequoia, although you can upgrade to four-wheel drive. There are three different front suspensions offered, from a standard independent double-wishbone design to a Toyota Racing Development (TRD) off-road specific suspension. No matter which trim level you decide on, the Sequoia has the same rear suspension.\n\nThe large Toyota SUV also offers a luxe interior to make you as comfortable as possible while on the road. Top-tier trims offer premium leather with contrast stitching, as well as heated and ventilated front seats. The second-row captain's chairs can recline, giving those backseat passengers plenty of space to nap.\n\nAs you would expect from a Toyota vehicle, the Toyota Safety Sense 2.5 package and the Star Safety System package both come standard across the entire lineup. Those safety packages include lane departure warning, pre-collision systems with pedestrian detection, and numerous other standard safety features.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) — Opening statements are expected to begin Tuesday in the trial of a Virginia man accused of murdering his wife and another man while carrying on a romantic relationship with a Brazilian au pair.\n\nBrendan Banfield is charged with aggravated murder in the February 2023 killings of Christine Banfield and Joseph Ryan at the Banfields’ home in northern Virginia. He has pleaded not guilty and faces life imprisonment.\n\nBrendan Banfield and Juliana Peres Magalhães, the family’s au pair, initially told investigators they shot Ryan after they found the stranger stabbing Christine Banfield in the bedroom. Prosecutors say Banfield and Magalhães lured Ryan to the house and staged it to look like they had shot an intruder. The two had begun a romantic relationship about a year earlier.\n\nBoth were initially arrested and charged with murder. In 2024, Magalhães pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter after cooperating with investigators.\n\nMagalhães told them she and Brendan Banfield created an account in his wife’s name on a social media platform for people interested in sexual fetishes. Ryan connected with the account, planning to meet on the morning of Feb. 24, 2023, for a sexual encounter involving a knife.\n\nNot all officials investigating the case have believed that Banfield and Magalhães lured Ryan to the home.\n\nBrendan Miller, a former digital forensic examiner with the Fairfax County Police Department, testified last year that he analyzed dozens of devices and concluded Christine Banfield had connected with Ryan herself. An evidence analysis team at the University of Alabama peer-reviewed and affirmed Miller’s digital forensic findings, according to evidence submitted to the court.\n\nMiller was transferred out of the department’s digital forensics unit in late 2024, though a former Fairfax County commander testified the reassignment was not punitive.\n\nJohn Carroll, Banfield’s attorney, has argued that Miller’s transfer is directly related to his work on the case. Carroll also noted in court that Fairfax County police reassigned the case’s lead detective after that man pushed back on the catfishing theory.\n\n“It is a theory in search of facts rather than a series of facts supporting a theory,” Carroll said.\n\nBanfield, whose then-4-year-old daughter was at the house on the morning of the killings, is also charged with child abuse and felony child cruelty in connection with the case. He will also face those charges during the aggravated murder trial.",

    "fullText": "The Defense Department has spent more than a year testing a device purchased in an undercover operation that some investigators think could be the cause of a series of mysterious ailments impacting US spies, diplomats and troops that are colloquially known as Havana Syndrome, according to four sources briefed on the matter.\n\nA division of the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, purchased the device for millions of dollars in the waning days of the Biden administration, using funding provided by the Defense Department, according to two of the sources. Officials paid “eight figures” for the device, these people said, declining to offer a more specific number.\n\nThe device is still being studied and there is ongoing debate — and in some quarters of government, skepticism — over its link to the roughly dozens of anomalous health incidents that remain officially unexplained.\n\nCNN has asked the Pentagon, HSI and the DHS for comment. The CIA declined to comment.\n\nThe device acquired by HSI produces pulsed radio waves, one of the sources said, which some officials and academics have speculated for years could be the cause of the incidents. Although the device is not entirely Russian in origin, it contains Russian components, this person added.\n\nOfficials have long struggled to understand how a device powerful enough to cause the kind of damage some victims have reported could be made portable; that remains a core question, according to one of the sources briefed on the device. The device could fit in a backpack, this person said.\n\nThe acquisition of the device has reignited a painful and contentious debate within the US government about Havana Syndrome, known officially as “anomalous health episodes.”\n\nThe mysterious illness first emerged in late 2016, when a cluster of US diplomats stationed in the Cuban capital of Havana began reporting symptoms consistent with head trauma, including vertigo and extreme headaches. In subsequent years, there have been cases reported around the world.\n\nIn the subsequent decade the intelligence community and the Defense Department have sought to understand if those officials were the victims of some kind of directed energy attack by a foreign government — with senior intelligence officials saying publicly that there wasn’t enough evidence to support that conclusion and victims arguing that the US government has gaslit them and ignored important evidence that Russia was attacking American government officials.\n\nStill, defense officials considered their findings serious enough that they briefed the House and Senate Intelligence Committees late last year, including reference to the acquired device and its testing.\n\nOne key concern now for some officials is that if the technology proves viable it may have proliferated, several of the sources said, meaning that more than one country could now have access to a device that may be capable of causing career-ending injuries to US officials.\n\nCNN was not able to learn where — or from whom — HSI purchased the device, but HSI has a history of collaboration with the Defense Department for operations that take place all over the globe. The office has broad jurisdiction to investigate crimes linked to customs violations, including investigations into the proliferation of US-controlled technology or expertise overseas.\n\nThose investigations are “the single biggest collaboration point between HSI and the US military,” according to a former Homeland Security official.\n\nFor example, when the US military came across US technology in Afghanistan or Iraq that raised questions about how those components came to the region, it would turn to HSI, according to the official.\n\nIt was also not clear how the US government learned of the existence of the device in order to purchase it. Havana Syndrome — and its cause — have remained frustratingly opaque to both the intelligence community and the medical community.\n\nOne problem facing the medical community is that there is still not a clear definition of “anomalous health incidents” or AHIs. Tests were done, in some cases, long after symptoms began, making it harder to understand what physically happened.\n\nIn 2022, an intelligence panel investigating the cause of AHIs said that some of the episodes could “plausibly” have been caused by “pulsed electromagnetic energy” emitted by an external source.\n\nBut in 2023, the intelligence community said publicly that it could not link any cases to a foreign adversary, ruling it unlikely that the unexplained illness was the result of a targeted campaign by an enemy of the US. As recently as January of 2025, the broader intelligence community assessment remained that it was very unlikely that the symptoms were caused by a foreign actor — even as an official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence emphasized that analysts cannot “rule out” the possibility in some small number of cases.\n\nThat stance has long incensed victims, many of whom believe strongly that intelligence exists offering black-and-white evidence that Russia is behind their symptoms, some of which have been severe enough to force retirement.\n\nSome current and former CIA officers have raised concerns that the agency soft-pedaled its investigation, CNN has previously reported.\n\nThe acquisition of the device has been treated by some victims as potential vindication.\n\n“If the [US government] has indeed uncovered such devices, then the CIA owes all the victims a f**king major and public apology for how we have been treated as pariahs,” Marc Polymeropoulos, one of the first CIA officers to go public with injuries he says he sustained in an attack in Moscow in 2017, said in a statement to CNN.\n\nCNN’s Kylie Atwood contributed to this story.",

    "description": "\"We are at a point in history where something amazing is happening, and it may be amazingly good, and it may be amazingly bad.\"",
    "fullText": "Pioneering computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton, whose work has earned him a Nobel Prize and the moniker “godfather of AI,” said artificial intelligence will spark a surge in unemployment and profits.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with the Financial Times last year, the former Google scientist cleared the air about why he left the tech giant, raised alarms on potential threats from AI, and revealed how he uses the technology. But he also predicted who the winners and losers will be.\n\n“What’s actually going to happen is rich people are going to use AI to replace workers,” Hinton said in September. “It’s going to create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits. It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer. That’s not AI’s fault, that is the capitalist system.”\n\nThat echoed comments he gave to Fortune in August 2025, when he said AI companies are more concerned with short-term profits than the long-term consequences of the technology.\n\nLayoffs haven’t spiked, but evidence is mounting that AI is shrinking opportunities, especially at the entry level where recent college graduates start their careers.\n\nA survey from the New York Fed at the time found that companies using AI were much more likely to retrain their employees than fire them, though layoffs are expected to rise in the coming months.\n\nHinton said earlier healthcare is the one industry that will be safe from the potential jobs armageddon.\n\n“If you could make doctors five times as efficient, we could all have five times as much health care for the same price,” he explained on the Diary of a CEO YouTube series in June 2025. “There’s almost no limit to how much health care people can absorb—[patients] always want more health care if there’s no cost to it.”\n\nStill, Hinton believes jobs that perform mundane tasks will be taken over by AI, while sparing some jobs that require a high level of skill.\n\nIn his interview with the FT, he also dismissed OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s idea to pay a universal basic income as AI disrupts the economy and reduces demand for workers, saying it “won’t deal with human dignity” and the value people derive from having jobs.\n\nHinton has long warned about the dangers of AI without guardrails, estimating a 10% to 20% chance of the technology wiping out humans after the development of superintelligence.\n\nIn his view, the dangers of AI fall into two categories: the risk the technology itself poses to the future of humanity, and the consequences of AI being manipulated by people with bad intent.",

    "fullText": "A new year is often meant to symbolize fresh starts, but for one of America's most recognizable casual dining brands, 2024 delivered the opposite. Instead of renewal, the year was marked by financial troubles, bankruptcy, and a significant loss of its domestic and international footprints.\n\nFounded in 1965 in New York City, this restaurant chain became a household name by serving classic American bar food and offering popular happy hour drink deals intended to make every day feel like a Friday. For decades, the brand portrayed itself as a lively escape where guests could relax, enjoy indulgent food, and unwind.\n\nBut behind that image, the chain had been quietly struggling with years of declining sales and rising costs. Those pressures ultimately reached a tipping point, leaving the company unable to sustain its financial obligations.\n\nIn early 2024, TGI Fridays began closing dozens of underperforming restaurants nationwide, describing the move as a strategic effort to streamline operations and position the brand for long-term growth. However, the closures continued throughout the year, reaching around 50 locations before the company made the announcement it had long feared would come.\n\nIn November of that same year, TGI Fridays filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing $37 million in debt. In the court filings, the company attributed much of its financial collapse to the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced it to temporarily close restaurants and suffer the aftermath of consumers' cautious spending.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing applied only to company-owned restaurants, not franchise locations. TGI Fridays secured debtor-in-possession financing, allowing restaurants to remain open and continue normal operations during the restructuring process.\n\nAt the time of the filing, the brand operated fewer than 40 company-owned restaurants in the U.S., alongside 120 domestic franchise locations, and 316 international units.\n\nTGI Fridays' struggles expanded beyond the U.S. In September 2024, Hostmore PLC, the brand's UK franchisee, filed for administration, the UK equivalent of bankruptcy, putting 87 restaurants at risk of closure.\n\nA month later, investment firms Breal Capital and Calveton acquired the UK business, preventing the brand from disappearing from the region entirely. The deal saved 51 locations and thousands of jobs, though 35 restaurants ultimately closed and more than 1,000 employees were laid off.\n\n53-year-old restaurant chain is quietly closing locations nationwide\n\nDunkin’ copies trendy Starbucks menu move\n\nChick-fil-A made a major change to its chicken, fans are noticing",

He showed me their truck and the chain that they had broke,” Ruiz told KTLA.\n\nIn all, it cost the couple about $1,500 to replace the equipment that was stolen during the ordeal.\n\nStarbucks employee delivers coffee to L.A. deputy with hand-drawn pig on cup\n\n“When he showed me the pictures, I was super upset,’ Ruiz added. “These families are hard-working, and we have a lot of things going on with this immigration right now and it’s just sad to see that someone would rob them of what’s bringing their livelihood.”\n\nThe incident was reported to police and the search is on for the two suspects involved in the violent robbery.\n\n“I hope whoever did it, they catch them, but more importantly that the family is able to recover,” Ruiz said. “Not just the physical but the emotional trauma that they’re going to experience from this.”\n\nWhile the couple is already back to work just days after the harrowing incident, community members organized a GoFundMe to help them recoup their losses and provide for their family during the recovery.",

    "fullText": "Another year, another playoff disappointment for a franchise that seems to have an abundance of them. The Los Angeles Chargers’ season came to an ugly end in the wild-card round, losing 16-3 in a meager performance against a New England Patriots team that wasn’t playing their best football either.\n\nEvery problem that hampered the Chargers this season came to full display alongside a mediocre performance from star quarterback Justin Herbert as they limped their way to another dispiriting end in the playoffs. As the quarterback and face of the team, Herbert will draw the ire of many talking heads who pin everything on him. The truth is this is a failing that encompasses just about everyone involved and will require a real look in the mirror this offseason.\n\n[Get more Chargers news: L.A. team feed]\n\nOne area the Chargers have been consistently plagued by is injuries. For the second straight season, their offensive line was crushed by injuries. All-Pro talent Rashawn Slater was lost for the season in early August, Joe Alt battled through injuries before having season-ending ankle surgery in early November and backup Trey Pipkins III missed a couple games while playing injured in several others. That’s not a survivable situation in the modern NFL with how talented and athletic the front seven players can be, but it’s a disappointing end to the season nonetheless. First-round running back Omarion Hampton also missed games throughout the season and never quite recovered when he came back and free-agent Najee Harris was put on season-ending injury reserve early in the season.\n\nIt seems to happen to this team as much or more than any other, but the unpredictable swings of health really put a ceiling on what the Chargers could accomplish. That doesn’t absolve the play of Herbert or any of the skill players, but they were playing with guys out of position and pulling so deep on the depth chart that it was preseason-quality offensive line play from time to time.\n\nL.A. entered the playoffs playing on a razor-thin margin of error that isn’t feasible to convert into wins at this point. The Chargers also didn’t get any offensive answers from Jim Harbaugh and offensive coordinator Greg Roman to alleviate some of these issues. There’s only so much window dressing that can be done during late-game comeback scenarios, but Roman once again has struggled to put together a cohesive passing game, and even rookie sensation Ladd McConkey had a serious dip in production in Year 2 with the Chargers.\n\nBeyond getting their players healthy and adding talent via the draft and free agency, the Chargers have to tinker with their plan of what this offense is going to look like if they want to have any sustained postseason success. Right now, they could use an overhaul of the passing game while they continue to develop their collection of young receivers. Even though Herbert hasn’t played his best games in the playoffs (0-3 career record), he still has the talent to go on a deep run and three playoff games is just three games. The entire sample size of his career says this is still one of the best quarterbacks in the league and there’s no reason to worry that he can’t do this. There’s still a long way to go on the 27-year-old’s career and given the Chargers’ overall competency they’ll be competing for the playoffs for years to come.\n\nThe good thing is they absolutely have a great thing going on defense, granted coordinator Jesse Minter doesn’t take a head coaching job this offseason. Minter’s defense held up its end of the bargain and the Chargers have done a great job developing some of the young talent on that side over the past two seasons. It’s on the offense and its über-talented quarterback and historically successful head coach to right the ship so they can maximize this current window.\n\nGames like Sunday make it seem like they’re further away than they really are, but they still need a few uncertain and unknown pieces to come to fruition in a big way before they’ll be ready to make that run people have been waiting for.\n\nSometimes it ain’t your year. Sometimes it ain’t anybody’s year. That’s how last night felt for the Chargers and now they’re off to what should be a busy offseason with their league-leading projected $109 million in salary-cap space.",

    "fullText": "The Phoenix Suns are one of the NBA’s biggest surprises of the season and it’s due mostly in part to first-year head coach Jordan Ott.\n\nThe end of the Kevin Durant-Bradley Beal era led many to believe Phoenix was entering a rebuild and that the newly-formed team built around Devin Booker and led by a longtime assistant coach would be a Western Conference bottom feeder.\n\nFast-forward nearly halfway through the season and the Suns are 24-15 and vying for a guaranteed spot in the playoffs.\n\nA revelation like this deserves some praise, and Booker and Phoenix forward Royce O’Neale made their case for Ott to contend for the NBA’s Coach of the Year award following Sunday’s win over the Washington Wizards.\n\nMORE: Dillon Brooks reacts to Suns owner shooting down idea of trading him\n\n“He’s a guru. He studies the game at a high level,” Booker said. “I’ve spoken on it before, he’s not just watching our games, he’s watching everybody across the league and what’s working and what’s not.\n\n“The evolution of it. He doesn’t feel like he has all the right answers. He understands that the game’s changing and evolving at the same time and you have to keep up.”\n\nBooker added that he noticed Ott’s meticulousness during the hiring process.\n\n“He just has a way with connecting with the players, putting us in positions to succeed,” O’Neale added. “He’s also willing to listen. See what we see out there while he’s coaching.”\n\nOtt has made a considerable impression on his roster, fanbase and the NBA at large. Should the Suns avoid the play-in outright and make the playoffs, the outcome of this season would be beyond anyone’s wildest imagination.\n\nJaren Jackson Jr. could be traded due to domino effect if Ja Morant is moved, NBA insider reveals\n\nWhy LeBron James will be only player in NBA with special patch on his jersey\n\nCeltics' Jaylen Brown has sarcastic wish granted, gets hefty fine after latest comments\n\nLakers’ JJ Redick removing shootarounds ahead of toughest stretch of season",

    "fullText": "This story was originally published on MyNorthwest.com\n\nTickets to Saturday’s Seahawks Divisional Round playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers at Lumen Field are a hot commodity.\n\nEven if you can find one, you might balk at the price.\n\nFor example, KIRO Newsradio found a pair of endzone tickets for $4,533.\n\nBut, if you’re feeling lucky, you could win one of nine pairs of playoff tickets and event parking, courtesy of the Washington State Lottery, which is holding a raffle.\n\n“We have been partners with the Seahawks since 2009,” Lottery Director Brian Bennett said, so they decided to get into a little playoff fun by holding a raffle.\n\nHere’s how it works: You must purchase a $10-dollar “Triple Jackpot” scratch ticket from a lottery worker in the Tacoma Mall courtyard, outside Macy’s, on Tuesday, Jan. 13, between 4 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.\n\n“Tickets can only be purchased with cash,” he said, “but you can buy as many entries as you’d like,” for a chance to win.\n\nWhile you wait to see who wins, Bennett said you can meet a former Seahawks star and a favorite Tacoma son.\n\n“We’re going to have Marcus Truffaut there at five o’clock signing autographs,” Bennett added.\n\nAt 6:45 p.m., a live drawing will be held to select the ticket winners. He said you don’t have to stick around for the drawing, but you do need to be available by phone, by 9 p.m., to win.\n\nBennett said it’s unclear just how many fans will turn out to enter the drawing and what your odds of winning will ultimately be.\n\nBut even if you enter just once, there is a chance you could walk away with two playoff tickets and parking. For $10. Not bad compared to the $4,500 endzone tickets (which were likely sold by the time you finished reading this).\n\nRead more of Heather Bosch’s stories here.",

    "fullText": "Former NBA All-Star does not believe in Bam Adebayo's viability as a star player originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Miami Heat have had a rocky season so far, possessing a 20-19 record. It has been a stellar year for players like Norman Powell and Jaime Jaquez Jr. This is a decent run for those players, but the expectations are higher for the longtime stars, which include Bam Adebayo.\n\nAs the longest-tenured player on the Heat roster, Adebayo has become a building block for the franchise. He is a tremendous defender, but he is not as good on the offensive side of the game.\n\nConsidering that he is known as one of the Heat's star players, Adebayo has been underwhelming. He is averaging 16.4 points per game, which is his lowest average since the 2019-20 season when he averaged 15.9 points a night.\n\nHe is also quite inefficient, shooting 44.6% from the field and 31.7% from beyond the arc. It has not been the prettiest of seasons for Adebayo, which has translated into some bad results for the Heat.\n\nMore: Bam Adebayo speaks on the Heat’s starting lineup struggles\n\nThis was quite evident against the Oklahoma City Thunder, as they lost 124-112. In that game, Adebayo was quite anonymous on the offensive end, scoring only six points.\n\nThat is not what is expected from a star player, and former All-Star guard Jeff Teague believes it disqualifies Adebayo from being called a star.\n\n\"Bam don’t really be killing. He’s just a good player. He’s not a star. He’s a good complimentary piece. He’s still a quality player, fringe All Star. I think if they get Ja Morant some new blood in there that can run P&Rs with him I think he’ll step up. I just don’t think he’s playing with a pure PG right now,\" Teague said on Club 520.\n\nMoving forward, the Heat might need other players who can be the true stars of the team. Tyler Herro can play that role, but he has not been fully healthy this season. Kel'el Ware might have that potential in the long run, but the Heat are stuck in limbo at the moment with their current construction.\n\nRick Carlisle announces his support for Norman Powell's All-Star campaign\n\nOKC's champion coach commends the Heat for being 'a great team to test yourself against'\n\nSpoelstra is not concerned about Tyler Herro's spot in the starting lineup amid issues\n\nTyler Herro gets honest about the 'young and fun' Miami Heat this season\n\nErik Spoelstra expresses disappointment in the Miami Heat's lack of effort",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSam Leavitt appeared to have settled his recruitment, but his commitment is now suddenly in question as negotiations continue behind the scenes.\n\nAfter reports surfaced that the top transfer quarterback committed to LSU and Lane Kiffin, sources told On3 that no paperwork had been signed and that Tennessee remain firmly in the race.\n\nVols officials and Leavitt’s camp have reportedly stayed in \"regular contact\" throughout Monday, and were never informed that he was LSU-bound. Negotiations are ongoing with Tennessee preparing one final push offer for Leavitt and his representatives.\n\nThis adds an interesting wrinkle to the situation as Kiffin is in desperate need of securing a quarterback. The market to land Leavitt has climbed into the $4 million to $5 million range, and was fueled by competition in a three-team battle between LSU, Tennessee and Miami.\n\nEven with momentum trending toward LSU, Tennessee coach Josh Heupel and his staff have continued to push, as the program seeks clarity at quarterback with Joey Aguilar’s 2026 eligibility uncertain.\n\nLeavitt left his Miami visit Sunday without committing and returned to Arizona to deliberate with his camp. Landing him would be significant for Kiffin, who is still seeking a clear QB1 despite adding Elon transfer Landen Clark.\n\nThe former Arizona State Sun Devils star has thrown for 4,652 career yards with 46 total touchdowns, leading ASU to a Big 12 title and College Football Playoff berth in 2024 after beginning his career at Michigan State Spartans.

    "fullText": "Antonio Conte did not speak to the media after his furious reaction to an Inter penalty in the 2-2 draw, so assistant Cristian Stellini preferred to focus on the ‘deserved’ Napoli result\n\nThe Partenopei refused to give in at San Siro, as they twice went behind to an early Federico Dimarco angled drive and the Hakan Calhanoglu penalty that enraged their coach, but Scott McTominay got them back on track for the 2-2 draw.\n\nConte was sent off from the touchline after that penalty for an Amir Rrahmani step on Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s foot, screaming ‘shame on you’ into the face of the fourth official, having already been angry at the spot-kick for their midweek 2-2 draw with Verona.\n\nWith this in mind, he sent assistant manager Stellini to speak with DAZN Italia.\n\nMILAN, ITALY – JANUARY 11: Antonio Conte, Head Coach of SSC Napoli is taken down the tunnel after being shown a red card during the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and SSC Napoli at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on January 11, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\n“I honestly wouldn’t discuss the penalty incident, as we already had a rather complicated week in that sense, so it’s best to just look beyond that and focus on the great performance of this team,” noted Stellini.\n\n“The reaction after the penalty gives us great confidence and strength. We had a team that proved once again in a difficult arena and against a strong opponent that it deserved to win the title last season.”\n\nDid Conte say anything to Stellini before the decision not to come to the media interviews?\n\n“There is great satisfaction for the reaction of the team, straight after the penalty we didn’t see the incident, it was just a reaction to conceding rather than to the challenge itself. We don’t want to rewind and look at that again.\n\n“After a red card in previous matches, he has decided not to come here. Hopefully he won’t get sent off in future, then it won’t happen again and everyone will be happy.”\n\nNapoli President Aurelio De Laurentiis took to social media after the game with this message.\n\n“Wonderful match! Fabulous Napoli. With the 9 players who have been absent for much of the season, what would Napoli have achieved by now?”\n\nMILAN, ITALY – JANUARY 11: Antonio Conte, Head Coach of SSC Napoli, looks on prior to the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and SSC Napoli at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on January 11, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nWhile Inter made all five of their substitutions this evening, Napoli and Conte only made two, and one of them was in stoppages.\n\n“We are in good physical shape, and have been for a while now,” noted Stellini.\n\n“We haven’t had the options to rotate much, and we must have a little more patience with that, but getting back twice against Inter at San Siro is not easy for anyone. I think we deserved the draw, had a very strong start to the second half, were convinced that we could do damage.\n\n“We’re satisfied with the character, determination and the quality that we showed this evening.”\n\nMILAN, ITALY – JANUARY 11: Antonio Conte, Head Coach of SSC Napoli is taken down the tunnel after being shown a red card during the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and SSC Napoli at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on January 11, 2026 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nIt was due to one of those injuries, to Romelu Lukaku, that Rasmus Hojlund was signed late in the summer from Manchester United.\n\n“When he arrived, we had already started the season and had a lot of games to play, so as he is also an international, we barely saw him in training in September and October. Despite that, he put in so much effort and humility, he works every day to improve, and we’d love to make him into a complete striker. He has a long way to go, but is already doing very well.”\n\nAs Milan were held to a 1-1 draw by Fiorentina today, which was also their second consecutive stalemate, it means the top spots remain intact.\n\nInter are the leaders on 43 points, followed by Milan on 40 and Napoli 39, all with a game in hand to be played on Wednesday and Thursday, rescheduled for the Supercoppa Italiana commitments.\n\nThe Partenopei were caught in third by Roma, but who have already played 20 rounds, and Juventus are in action against Cremonese tomorrow evening.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nKevin Durant said it best a decade ago — moms are the real MVPs.\n\nFor C.J. Stroud, that sentiment remains the foundation of a career that continues to defy the odds. After an historic rookie campaign, Stroud has solidified himself as the face of the Houston Texans, orchestrating a stunning late-season surge in 2025. Despite a 3-5 start to the year, Stroud led the Texans to nine straight wins to close the regular season, finishing 12-5 and securing a third consecutive trip to the postseason.\n\nStroud already knows what it takes to succeed on the big stage. In 2023, he became the youngest quarterback in NFL history to win a playoff game when the Texans routed the Browns in the Wild Card round. Now a seasoned veteran of the January spotlight, Stroud has won two playoff games in his first two seasons.\n\nThrough every record-breaking touchdown and every high-pressure drive, Stroud continues to credit his mother, Kimberly, for the resilience that has come to define his game.\n\nFamily ❤️💙 pic.twitter.com/K6qwCA6E5q\n\nStroud's close relationship with his mom has been well documented since the Ohio State product entered the league in the fall.

Stroud.\n\nThe two have a very tight relationship. Both have been open about the hardships they faced during Stroud's childhood due to the decisions of his father, Coleridge Bernard Stroud III. The quarterback's dad has been arrested twice and is currently incarcerated on a 38-year sentence.\n\nThe arrest of the patriarch put the family \"into financial ruin.\" The four children and Stroud's mother were close to being homeless as a result.\n\n“My mom, she had to play both roles for me for a while — mother and father,\" Stroud said during the NFL Draft. \"I’m super blessed to have a mother like I do.”\n\nWith Stroud's father mostly absent during the quarterback's adolescence, it caused Stroud to mature at a young age — something that helped mold Stroud into the man he is today.\n\n\"He had a choice when his father went away,\" Stroud's mother said. \"He was going to let that motivate him and be the best or he was going to succumb to it and become a statistic of a kid whose parent did something they shouldn’t.\n\n\"I sit and I’m amazed at how resilient he is. C.J. is the most amazing human I have ever met.\"\n\nMORE: Why is C.J. Stroud's dad in prison?\n\nIn November 2023, Kimberly and C.J. launched the C.J. Stroud Foundation, a non-profit organization that helps single mothers, children of incarcerated parents, and criminal justice reform.\n\n\"There’s a lot of different passions that [C.J.] has ... [helping] single moms [is one of them] since I was a single mom,\" Stroud's mother said. \"We all started crying [during the event] because a mom, her husband’s in prison ... same situation.\n\n\"I’m really grateful that C.J. has taken the step … for a young voice in our generation to shed light on some of the issues that go on in this world.\"",

There was never that much clarity on what Mixon had done to his foot, and at first, there wasn't a suggestion that it would be this lengthy an absence.\n\nBut as time went on, Mixon simply never came back into the picture. The Texans never alluded to activating him.\n\nMORE: Bills, Josh Allen never stopped pushing, and the Super Bowl dream is alive\n\nAs early as a handful of weeks into the season, Texans coach DeMeco Ryans had already spoken about Mixon in the past tense, saying, “We’re rolling with the guys that are here. That’s the main thing. We miss Joe, miss his energy, and his enthusiasm and everything he brought to our team. We continue to press forward and hope he’s doing well.”\n\nThe Texans have used Woody Marks, Jawhar Jordan and Nick Chubb in the backfield.\n\nMixon is under contract with the Texans for 2026 for $8 million, but they can get out of the deal with only a $2 million dead cap hit, which seems likely at this point.\n\nBears' Colston Loveland joins Gronk in NFL tight end history\n\nThe Joe Montana reason the Packers might fire Matt LaFleur\n\nA.J.

Good luck on your next chapter!”\n\nRaonic won 23 ATP Tour titles during his career; however, he was never able to win one of the major titles.’\n\nAlong with his one Grand Slam final loss, Raonic also lost all four of his Masters 1000 final appearances.\n\nTo be fair to the Canadian star, all of his Masters 1000 final losses came against either Novak Djokovic or Rafael Nadal – two of the greatest players in tennis history.\n\nIvan Ljubicic, the former coach of Roger Federer, has also sent a message to Raonic via Instagram.\n\nHe said: “Congrats on your impressive career! Everyone knows your future will be even more successful. Happy retirement, Milos!”\n\nLjubicic and Raonic worked together for two-and-a-half years before parting ways in November 2015.\n\nAfter they split, Raonic thanked the experienced coach for his help.\n\nAs per Tennis.com, Raonic said: “I’d like to thank Ivan Ljubicic for the tremendous amount of support, knowledge and understanding he has given me.\n\n“The decision has been made that we will not continue our professional relationship in the coming year.”",

    "description": "A day after their playoff loss to the New England Patriots, Chargers players are short on answers to the team's problems after falling short of expectations",
    "fullText": "Ladd McConkey paused for a moment in front of his locker.\n\n“I don’t know,” he said, less than 24 hours after another humbling Chargers playoff loss.\n\n“To be honest with you, it's like, I don't know — but you gotta get that monkey off our back,\" McConkey said.\n\nA tormenting 16-3 defeat to the New England Patriots in the AFC wild-card round sent the Chargers' season to an early finish Sunday for the second consecutive season. Little went right against the Patriots in coach Jim Harbaugh's second year in L.A., prompting questions about what needs to change to make the Chargers a Super Bowl contender.\n\nHarbaugh, general manager Joe Hortiz and the rest of the team's staff will have a full offseason to delve into went awry against the Patriots and a season that fell short of expectations.\n\nAgainst New England, there were offensive line woes and Justin Herbert getting pressured on 30 of 44 drop-backs, which, according to Pro Football Focus, was the second-highest pressure rate of the entire season (behind the Chargers’ Week 14 effort against the Philadelphia Eagles).\n\nHerbert, still searching for his first postseason victory after his third defeat Sunday, showed up in uncharacteristic fashion against the Patriots.\n\nLast season, he tossed a career-worst four interceptions in a playoff loss to Houston. Against New England, Herbert struggled to find open receivers and was sacked six times while the Chargers failed to implement a run game, leading to questions about offensive coordinator Greg Roman’s future with the team.\n\nCenter Bradley Bozeman, often at the heart of public criticism over the Chargers' offensive line, fought back tears when speaking about his struggles on the field. But the eighth-year veteran got choked up the most talking about Herbert.\n\n“It just sucks that we can't get him there,” Bozeman said. “That's what sucks. He's one of my best friends — and it sucks, like it just sucks, because I want it bad for him. I want it bad for myself, I want it bad for everybody, but him especially.”\n\nWhatever the fix, if the Chargers have one, the makeup of the franchise will dramatically shift. Defensive coordinator Jesse Minter is being courted by a host of NFL teams — including the Cleveland Browns, Tennessee Titans and Las Vegas Raiders — for head coaching jobs.\n\nWide receiver Keenan Allen, linebackers Odafe Oweh and Khalil Mack and defensive lineman Teair Tart are among 27 players set to hit free agency. The Chargers also are set to have more than $100 million in salary-cap space to deal with for potential additions.\n\nTart expressed interest in a potential extension with the team. Mack, who also mulled retirement a season ago, is going to think about whether he wants to come back for a 13th NFL season.\n\nThe 34-year-old declined to say whether he'd be back with the Chargers if he decided to play.\n\n“Just trying to stay as present as possible,” Mack said. “Make a decision based on how I’m feeling, how my family’s feeling. ... Just figuring it out day by day.”\n\nOutside linebacker Tuli Tuipulotu, who emerged in his third season in the NFL with 13 sacks, was asked if he felt anything needed to shift to turn playoff heartbreak into victories.\n\nTuipulotu repeated a sentiment that defensive back Tarheeb Still and safety Daiyan Henley repeated earlier Monday:\n\n“I just hope everyone on defense comes back,” Tuipulotu said.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "In the latest twist in the Salesi Moa saga, one of the crown jewels of Utah’s 2026 recruiting class is transferring before ever suiting up for the Utes.\n\nThe four-star athlete, tabbed the No. 1 prospect in the state of Utah and the No. 45 overall player in the nation by 247Sports composite rankings, is hitting the transfer portal ahead of his freshman season, according to a report by 247Sports’ Blair Angulo.\n\nMoa, who changed his commitment from Tennessee to Utah in the early signing period, enrolled at the University of Utah earlier in January prior to entering his name into the transfer portal.\n\nPer CBS Sports’ Chris Hummer, he has a “do not contact” designation in the transfer portal, which “typically signifies a player knows where he’ll transfer to upon entry.”\n\nMichigan, a school that Moa took a visit to during his high school recruitment, is considered the favorite to land the talented prospect.\n\nThe Fremont High star had 63 receptions for 1,272 yards and 16 touchdowns in his senior, according to the Deseret News prep stats database. Moa also had 57 tackles, three interceptions and five pass deflections.\n\nAlong with Kelvin Obot, Moa was considered the crown jewel of Utah’s 2026 recruiting class. Even with Kyle Whittingham leaving to Michigan, no one from that class asked out of their commitment until Moa did on Monday.\n\nFor Utah, the loss of Moa is a big one. The four-star recruit had a chance to crack Utah’s starting lineup at receiver and be an instant-impact player.\n\nThe timing of Moa’s departure — late in the transfer cycle — is a blow for the Utes, who will need to secure another promising wide receiver to replace Moa.\n\nThus far in the transfer portal, Utah has landed one receiver — Utah State’s Braden Pegan, who had 60 receptions, 926 yards and five touchdowns last season.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlthough this season’s NBA trade deadline doesn’t project to be as eventful as years prior, the trade season gives contending teams like the Phoenix Suns the opportunity to refine the margins.\n\nWhat are the margins the Suns need to refine? You may ask. One move could include moving off a piece to get below the luxury tax line a half a season removed from sitting above the second apron.\n\nAs ESPN NBA insider Brian Windhorst suggests, Phoenix may not need to make a roster move because its biggest addition is already rostered.\n\n“I know it sounds corny and I know fans love midseason acquisitions,” Windhorst said in his guest appearance on Gerald Bourguet’s Suns After Dark podcast. “The Suns have been involved in big-time midseason acquisitions before, but their midseason trade acquisition is gonna be Jalen Green.”\n\nMORE: Devin Booker, Suns players make case for Jordan Ott as Coach of the Year\n\nGreen has played in just two games for Phoenix this season, remaining out since early November with a right hamstring strain. In his first and only full game with the Suns, he erupted for 29 points on 6-for-13 on 3-pointers and 4-for-7 on 2-pointers in a 115-102 win against the Los Angeles Clippers. He exited the next game after playing just six minutes.\n\nThe former Houston Rockets guard was the key figure in Phoenix's offseason trade that sent Kevin Durant to the Rockets for Green, Brooks and the draft picks that turned into Khaman Maluach, Rasheer Fleming and Koby Brea.\n\nWhile Green hasn't been able to see the floor, Brooks has risen as a prominent offensive staple in the Suns' otherwise lackluster scoring attack, what with Green, a scoring force in his own right, missing all but two games this season\n\nJaren Jackson Jr. could be traded due to domino effect if Ja Morant is moved, NBA insider reveals\n\nWhy LeBron James will be only player in NBA with special patch on his jersey\n\nCeltics' Jaylen Brown has sarcastic wish granted, gets hefty fine after latest comments\n\nLakers’ JJ Redick removing shootarounds ahead of toughest stretch of season",

    "description": "The Customs and Border Protection officers are joining 2,000 other officers and agents at the Department of Homeland Security who have recently been deployed to the Minneapolis region.",
    "fullText": "The Trump administration is sending roughly 1,000 more immigration officers to Minnesota, expanding its law enforcement surge in the state and potentially escalating already tense relations between federal and local officials in Minneapolis.\n\nThe Customs and Border Protection officers are joining 2,000 other officers and agents at the Department of Homeland Security who have been deployed to the Minneapolis-St. Paul region recently, said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said last week that the effort was its “largest operation to date.”\n\nLocal officials in Minneapolis have urged federal forces to leave the city, saying their efforts to arrest immigrants were sowing chaos and danger. Protests have also erupted nationwide after the killing of Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman who was shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis last week. Ms. Good had been participating in a protest in response to immigration agents who had been spotted in the city.\n\nOn Monday, state and city officials in Minnesota and Illinois filed federal lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing that the mass deployment of immigration officers to the Minneapolis and Chicago regions violated the U.S. Constitution. The Minnesota lawsuit asked a judge to block federal officials from “implementing the unprecedented surge” in the state.\n\nTrump administration officials have repeatedly defended their enforcement operations in both states.\n\nKristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said in an interview with Fox News on Sunday that the department was sending more immigration officers to the Minneapolis region, which would allow federal law enforcement there to work safely. Ms. Noem added that people who conducted “violent activities against law enforcement” or impeded operations would be held accountable.\n\n“We’re going to keep doing our jobs,” Ms. Noem said. “Criminal illegal aliens in this country are going to be brought to justice.”\n\nThe increase in immigration officers adds to an already massive federal law enforcement presence in the Minneapolis region. In comparison, the Minneapolis Police Department has roughly 600 officers.\n\nThe Trump administration has intensified its focus on Minnesota in recent weeks, saying it was “unleashing a relentless assault” on the state to root out fraud. Federal officials have also vowed to ramp up enforcement operations in other Democratic-led states including California and New York.\n\nThe administration’s focus on Minnesota follows fraud investigations into a pandemic-era program meant to feed children and other safety net programs in the state. More than 90 people, most of them of Somali origin, have been charged with felonies in recent years. President Trump has used xenophobic language to attack Somalis who are living in the United States, saying, “We don’t want them in our country.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said on Friday that it was reviewing thousands of refugee cases in Minnesota, subjecting immigrants who had already been approved for status to new interviews and background checks. Groups that provide assistance to refugees criticized the effort and said it was an unnecessary attempt to scrutinize immigrants who had already completed a thorough vetting process.\n\nThe Trump administration also said it would suspend funding for food stamps in Minnesota. A similar effort to freeze billions in federal funding for child care and social service programs in five Democratic-led states, including Minnesota, was temporarily blocked by a federal judge in New York last week.",

It also allows us to do more on-the-ground journalism like this. Hit the green button below to learn more.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS, Minn. — The frontline of America’s slow-moving civil war has come to Minnesota. The Department of Homeland Security doubled down on their occupation of the state following last week’s murder of Renee Nicole Good. Now residents armed with whistles, snowballs, and group chats race through the streets, trying to protect one another from the more than 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers swarming the city.\n\nDuring my four days in the Twin Cities, I watched the fabric of American society start to break down. ICE agents armed with assault weapons, tear gas, stun grenades, and pepper spray balls drive cars off the road and break down people’s doors with abandon. The institutions that are meant to protect us — local law enforcement, local politicians, the basic machinery of democracy and accountability — have all but thrown their hands up. “They have bigger guns than we do,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said during an interview over the weekend.\n\nThe digital tools activists have come to rely on have similarly been turned against them. The days of the hashtag and the Facebook Event are over. Instead, anti-ICE organizing is done quietly, via word-of-mouth or (theoretically) untraceable Signal groups. On Saturday, local volunteers pulled over next to my car and asked Panic World producer Grant Irving and I if we were with ICE. We told them we were journalists and they explained they had to ask because our rental car had Florida plates. “A lot of the rental cars around here have been used by ICE,” one of the volunteers told us, before using a walkie talkie to tell other volunteers to stand down and stop monitoring our car.\n\nThe public social networks once relied on to mobilize a community, meanwhile, are full of right-wing propaganda, distorting what’s happening on the ground. ICE has been stalking Minneapolis for months, but the current conflict in the city started in December when far-right Gen Z content creator Nick Shirley published a video titled, “I Investigated Minnesota’s Billion Dollar Fraud Scandal.” Shirley claimed that allegedly fraudulent daycares like Quality Learning Center are supposedly receiving federal funds without having any children enrolled. Shirley’s video has been watched 3.5 million times on YouTube and 139 million times on X. The version on X became a right-wing sensation in the days after Christmas last year. The right-wing hysteria was so loud that no one seemed to notice that the story had been covered extensively by various local and national news organizations over the years and that there’s an FBI investigation currently looking into the allegations. Attention is the only thing that matters. “Who would’ve thought Quality Learing [sic] Center would’ve started all this,” Shirley posted on X over the weekend, sharing a video of a massive anti-ICE protest in Minneapolis.\n\nWith tensions inflamed in the city — and following pressure from Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk, and FBI Director Kash Patel, who all shared Shirley’s video — ICE ramped up their presence. There are more agents in Minnesota than there are local police in both of the state’s major cities. An escalation that directly led to the murder of Good last Wednesday. And now, in response to that, ICE has effectively taken control of the city. Rumors swirl about Trump sending in the National Guard or declaring martial law next.\n\nICE agents are, simply put, fucking clowns. According to The Atlantic, they receive 47 days of training — in honor of Trump, the 47th president, naturally. Many of them, also, can barely read or write, apparently. The ones I spent the weekend following around didn’t even have proper uniforms, with some wearing sneakers. In Minnesota. In January. These dipshits are also wearing camo in the snow. They clearly do not have any training when it comes to their own weapons either. Multiple times over the last few days, I watched officers fire pepper spray balls at the feet of protestors barely a few inches away from them. These weapons are basically paintball guns full of concentrated pepper spray. So when they hit a target, they explode into the air. Which meant ICE agents regularly ended up poisoning themselves with their own weapons. I also watched two agents ask each other if a canister they were about to fire at the crowd was tear gas or a stun grenade. (It ended up being a stun grenade that then ignited the tear gas they had already shot at us, which started a fire in the street that a protestor had to help them put out.)\n\nIn what is assuredly bad news for Bari Weiss’ newest suffer pig, CBS News host Tony Dokoupil, who has spent the last week both-sides-ing the conflict in Minnesota, ICE agents make no effort to hide what “side” they’re on. I’ve seen up close how intertwined the twin engines of the Trump regime are. Brutal state violence and hysterical right-wing internet content work together in lockstep. According to The Washington Post, the agency is under pressure from The White House to create as much content as possible. Which is why ICE agents have a phone in one hand and a gun in the other. But it goes beyond that.\n\nDuring a showdown with protestors at the Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, I watched as one ICE officer fist-bumped a pro-Trump content creator once he learned he was there to support them. I also watched as a gang of groyper livestreamers, led by January 6th insurrectionist Jake Lang, rile up a crowd of protestors, creating the perfect pretext for ICE agents to fire pepper spray balls and tear gas at the crowd. To say nothing of the other right-wing media networks like OAN, NewsNation, and The Daily Wire, that sent video crews to the city, all of them running their own version of Libs Of TikTok. Singling out protestors and ridiculing them on social media. Olivia Reingold, one of Weiss’ Substack squad, spent the weekend on a state-sanctioned ride-along with ICE agents, posting selfies to her Instagram Stories.\n\nBut the most egregious example I saw of how tightly connected these two worlds are happened on Saturday morning. As a convoy of vehicles driven by ICE agents arrived at the federal building, a woman punched the window of one of the cars. Close to two dozen agents jumped out of the convoy and tackled her and her friend to the ground. Immediately following them, coming out of the same car as the agents, was Fox News national correspondent Matt Finn, who filmed the whole altercation with a massive shit-eating grin on his face. When I started filming him and asked who he was with and what he was using that video for, he turned his back towards me and tried to hide his face. “Intense video,” Finn would later caption his post on X.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate how efficient Trump’s shock tactics are and how existentially terrifying they are to oppose. Thanks to National Security Presidential Memorandum 7 (NSPM-7), any form of anti-ICE protest can be labeled as terrorism, including filming them. And Attorney General Pam Bondi has added additional protections for ICE, in a memorandum titled, “Ending Political Violence Against ICE.” You can’t dox agents and you’ll get hit with federal charges if you post anything that’s deemed to be threatening them. ICE also recently purchased two new surveillance systems, Tangles and Webloc, which can track phone activity without a warrant. This morning, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced that DHS plans to launch its own drone program next.\n\nThey are tightening the noose and there is very little room left for any kind of meaningful protest. Minnesotans over the weekend organized massive demonstrations, with thousands of people marching through the south side of Minneapolis several days in a row. But there was no law enforcement there, nor were there any ICE officers (at least in uniform). No one to whom they could direct their anger at. As for local leaders, Rep. Ilhan Omar spoke to the crowd on Saturday, but even she looked shaken. A few hours before the march, ICE agents blocked Omar from inspecting the federal building and even threatened her with pepper spray. Right after Good was killed last week, Noem created a policy that blocks congressional visits without a seven-day notice.\n\nThe protestors I spoke to in Minneapolis were not antifa super soldiers. They were normal people who hoped that the show of support would force the media to cover it and maybe convince people to join their local ICE watch. Their demands were clear: That ICE leave the community and that Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent accused of killing Good, be charged with murder. And as inspiring as it was to see a community come together like that, I can’t help but wonder what a protest can even accomplish when those in power do not think they will ever have to lose that power. It brings us dangerously close to the point where a “fuck Trump” sign at a No King’s Rally amounts to a viral Bluesky post and little else. And it won’t be long until a much darker, far more unpredictable form of opposition replaces that.\n\nThe Trump administration has pushed us to a point where every American now has to make a choice between their own personal safety and the safety of their neighbors.\n\nLike the Minnesota-based TikTok user @stormibabyy27, who uploaded a video of her standoff with ICE agents last week. She ordered DoorDash and ICE agents waited for the deliverywoman to exit her vehicle before pouncing. They’ve been following gig workers around for months. None of the major delivery apps have said anything about protecting their workers, obviously.\n\nThe 15-minute video captures the moment where local law enforcement, over the phone, tell @stormibabyy27 that she has to give the DoorDasher to ICE or risk being charged with harboring a fugitive. She, thankfully, puts enough pressure on the ICE agents to leave, warning them over and over again that she has “11,000 followers on TikTok” and to not come back until they have a court order.\n\nThe lesson here is clear: We’re on our own now. They have guns and drones and they can hack our phones and smear our names online and arrest us without a warrant and charge us with terrorism. And all we have are whistles and protests and TikTok and group chats and maybe some journalism. Our local leaders are admitting they can’t help us. So we’re left with nothing but hope that all of that will be enough. But it’s impossible to shake the profoundly unsettling feeling that we have clearly stepped across the threshold into a very different political reality. And it’s not a matter of if it arrives in your town, but when.\n\nAdditional reporting provided by Grant Irving.\n\nThe following is a paid ad.

    "description": "A malicious Chrome extension steals newly created MEXC API keys, exfiltrates them to Telegram, and enables full account takeover with trading and with...",
    "fullText": "Socket’s Threat Research Team identified a malicious Chrome extension, MEXC API Automator, published to the Chrome Web Store on September 1, 2025, by a threat actor under the alias jorjortan142. Marketed as a convenient way to automate trading on the centralized cryptocurrency exchange MEXC, the extension programmatically creates new MEXC API keys, enables withdrawal permissions, hides that permission in the user interface (UI), and exfiltrates the resulting API key and secret to a hardcoded Telegram bot controlled by the threat actor.\n\nOnce installed, any MEXC account accessed from the infected browser is exposed to full programmatic control by the threat actor, who can:\n\nAt the time of writing, the extension remains live on the Chrome Web Store. We have notified Google and flagged this extension.\n\nMEXC is a large centralized cryptocurrency exchange that offers trading to users in more than 170 countries and territories. That global footprint, combined with an API that supports automated trading and withdrawals, makes MEXC an attractive target for cybercriminals who want to turn stolen API credentials into direct financial gain.\n\nOnline reviews estimate that MEXC serves millions of users. At the same time, the exchange states that it does not provide services to users in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Singapore, parts of China, and several sanctioned countries. Public guides still encourage users in some of these countries to access MEXC via VPNs, especially in the United States, which broadens the potential victim pool and complicates response and recovery.\n\nOn the surface, MEXC API Automator simply automates API key creation for traders. In reality, it introduces a hidden backdoor that gives the threat actor remote control over those accounts by stealing high-value API keys with withdrawal permissions. Rather than harvesting passwords, the extension targets API keys that already allow withdrawals. These keys are:\n\nOnce the threat actor obtains such a key, they can interact with the MEXC API as the victim, execute trades, and initiate withdrawals without needing the user’s password or second factor authentication.\n\nIn the Chrome Web Store description, the threat actor markets MEXC API Automator as a productivity extension that “automates API key creation on MEXC platform”. The listing claims the extension will automatically generate API keys with the necessary permissions, “including access to trading and withdrawals”, directly on the MEXC API management page.\n\nIn practice, as soon as the user navigates to MEXC’s API management page, the extension injects a single content script, script.js, and begins operating inside the already authenticated MEXC session.\n\nThe extension also targets a global audience. Its translations object provides localized UI strings in English, Spanish, French, Russian, and Chinese, which makes the same malicious behavior accessible to a broad victim pool across multiple regions.\n\nThe extension’s content script begins by checking that the current URL contains /user/openapi. If it does, the script waits for the page to finish loading, then immediately invokes its automation logic. There is no confirmation prompt or configuration screen. For the victim, simply opening MEXC’s API key management page is enough to trigger the attack.\n\nMEXC API Automator is a manifest v3 Chrome extension that injects script.js into *://*.mexc.com/user/openapi*, the MEXC API key management page. Once active, the script locates the API key form, programmatically selects every available permission checkbox, creates a new API key, and ensures that withdrawal capability is enabled. At the same time, it manipulates the page’s styles so that the withdrawal permission appears disabled in the UI, even though it is included in the request sent to MEXC.\n\nThe extension does not try to bypass two factor authentication or intercept one-time codes. Instead, it lets the user complete 2FA in the normal way. When MEXC displays the success modal containing the freshly generated Access Key and Secret Key, the script resumes control, extracts both values from the modal, and sends them in a background HTTPS request to a hardcoded Telegram bot and chat controlled by the threat actor.\n\nIn effect, the threat actor uses the Chrome Web Store as the delivery mechanism, the MEXC web UI as the execution environment, and Telegram as the exfiltration channel. The result is a purpose built credential-stealing extension that targets MEXC API keys at the moment they are created and configured with full permissions.\n\nTo make the withdrawal permission look disabled while it stays enabled on the server side, the extension adds special handling for the withdraw checkbox: it strips the visible checked state, injects CSS to hide the tick mark, and monitors the element to reapply this deception if the UI changes. Here and below, the code snippets shows the core logic with our inline comments.\n\nThis logic keeps the withdrawal permission enabled in the submitted form while it appears disabled in the interface. Even if MEXC’s own code reapplies the ant-checkbox-checked class, the mutation observer immediately strips it again.\n\nFor a trader glancing at the form, the configuration looks safe. The key is labeled TradingBotKey, the risk reminder is checked, and the withdrawal box looks unchecked. In reality, the resulting API key has full trading and withdrawal capabilities.\n\nOnce the observer finds the relevant elements, the script extracts the key and secret from the DOM and passes them into a function named sendKeysToTelegram.\n\nThe exfiltration channel is straightforward. The extension issues HTTPS POST requests to the Telegram Bot API and sends the API key and secret as plain text in the request body. It does not touch files on disk, browser storage, or operating system APIs. It operates entirely inside the browser sandbox using DOM access and network calls, which makes the behavior harder for endpoint tools that focus on processes and file system activity to detect.\n\nOnce the bot receives the message, the threat actor can load the key into custom tooling, feed it into automated drainer scripts, or sell it to other cybercriminals. The risk persists as long as the key remains valid and unrevoked, even if the victim later removes the extension.\n\nThe Chrome Web Store lists MEXC API Automator as version 1.0, last updated in September 2025, and attributes it to a developer using the handle jorjortan142 with the contact email jorjortan142@gmail[.]com.\n\nOutside the Chrome Web Store, the same handle appears on X (formerly Twitter) as @jorjortan142 with the display name “sushi.crypto”. That profile describes the user as “CEO Telegram Crypto Wallet SwapSushi” and links to a Telegram bot at t[.]me/swapsushibot, which advertises swapping and earning crypto.\n\nA YouTube channel named “SwapSushi” (@SwapSushiBot) promotes the same bot and brand, again pointing users to t[.]me/swapsushibot. Open source blocklists maintained by anti-scam communities list swapsushi[.]net among crypto-related scam domains, which indicates that at least some SwapSushi-branded infrastructure has already been flagged as suspicious.\n\nTaken together, the shared handle, consistent “SwapSushi” branding, and cross linking between the X account, the Telegram bot, the YouTube channel, and the Chrome Web Store listing support a moderate confidence assessment that MEXC API Automator and the SwapSushi Telegram wallet or swap bot belong to the same threat actor. This cluster focuses on cryptocurrency tooling and, in the case of MEXC API Automator, on clearly malicious behavior that combines covert API key theft with withdrawal permission tampering.\n\nInside script.js, many inline comments are written in Russian. Phrases such as “Основная автоматизация” (“main automation”) and “Мониторинг изменений класса” (“monitoring changes of the class”) read like original developer notes rather than copied boilerplate. Russian language comments are frequent and concentrated around key logic, which strongly suggests that the threat actor behind the malicious Chrome extension is a Russian speaker, while still short of country level attribution.\n\nAny MEXC user who installs MEXC API Automator and allows it to create an API key effectively hands full programmatic control of their account to the threat actor. The extension does not need to guess passwords or bypass authentication. It operates inside an already authenticated browser session, automates key creation with broad permissions, and intercepts the API key and secret at the moment they appear in the success modal.\n\nWe assess that this technique will be reused and expanded. By hijacking a single API workflow inside the browser, threat actors can bypass many traditional controls and go straight for long lived API keys with withdrawal rights. The same playbook can be readily adapted to other exchanges, DeFi dashboards, broker portals, and any web console that issues tokens in session, and future variants are likely to introduce heavier obfuscation, request broader browser permissions, and bundle support for multiple platforms into a single extension.\n\nStart by auditing browser extensions on any system that accesses exchanges, online banking portals, or administrative dashboards. Remove MEXC API Automator and any similar extension that offers to manage API keys or automate trading unless it comes from a trusted vendor and its code has been reviewed. In enterprise environments, prefer centrally managed browser policies and extension allow lists over ad hoc installation by end users.\n\nTreat API keys as secrets, not as long lived configuration values. Store exchange keys in dedicated secret management systems, rotate them regularly, and monitor exchange logs for anomalous activity such as withdrawals from new IP ranges, rapid key creation, or spikes in API usage.\n\nFinally, treat browser extensions as part of your software supply chain inventory. Track which extensions are installed across the fleet, what permissions they request, and which sites they can access. Use Socket’s Chrome extension protection to inventory every extension in use, surface permissions and host access, and block risky updates before they land on endpoints. The same analysis engine that flags supply chain risk in open source packages now scans hundreds of thousands of extensions and alerts on behaviors such as excessive permissions, unexpected page access, and data exfiltration.",

    "fullText": "The new year is upon us, and for many, this is a great time to refresh and update our wardrobes.\n\nSo, we asked stylists to share what we should be wearing and shopping for right now, as well as the garments we should consider keeping tucked away through 2026. First up? Pants.\n\nHere's a look at the pants stylists predict will be in and out throughout the year.\n\nAccording to celebrity stylist Sandra Okerulu, you'll want to have a pair (or two) of metallic pants in your closet this year.\n\nThe statement styles are \"very fashionable, and they allow you to take charge of the room you're in,\" she told BI. Some pairs — especially if they're a looser fit — can even be quite comfortable.\n\nOkerulu recommended styling metallic pants with sneakers and a T-shirt for a more relaxed look or upping the ante a bit for a more formal occasion with a nice blazer and button-down.\n\nIt's not time to toss your favorite pair of joggers to the side just yet.\n\nIn 2026, people are looking to prioritize comfort and style, and these sporty pants can give you the best of both worlds when styled properly — whether with a pair of sneakers or even a heel, depending on the look.\n\n\"There's something about that relaxed jogger look that really has been elevated now for work and everyday wear,\" Okerulu said. \"You can wear them when you're going to work out or when you're going for a job.\"\n\nUltimately, they can be a \"fashionable, fun piece\" to have in your wardrobe, Okerulu told BI.\n\nDianne Boyer, personal stylist and founder of Dianne In Style, said that wide-leg trousers aren't going anywhere in 2026.\n\n\"The overall look for pants will be more streamlined and tailored, and wide-leg pants give a more tailored yet relaxed look,\" Boyer told BI.\n\nPlus, she said, \"They are universally flattering because the clean vertical line elongates the leg and the wider hem balances the hips, creating a long, lean silhouette for every body shape.\"\n\nLeather pants are no longer about adding \"shock value\" to a look, celebrity stylist Anna Lavo said.\n\nInstead, they'll remain popular throughout 2026 because they add instant strength and edge to an outfit while still keeping it polished.\n\n\"This trend reflects a larger shift toward confidence, dressing pieces that feel powerful, versatile, and intentional,\" Lavo told BI. \"Leather pants now move easily from daytime tailoring to evening wear, making them a modern wardrobe essential rather than a statement piece.\"\n\nDenim never really goes out of style. This year, the fitted bootcut is king as people seek out jeans with flattering, well-proportioned silhouettes.\n\n\"It's slim through the thigh with a gentle flare which evens out proportions, highlights the waist, and creates the appearance of longer legs,\" Boyer told BI. \"The bootcut looks even more flattering when paired with a heel or pointed-toe shoe.\"\n\nAccording to Lavo, \"overly tactical cargo pants,\" especially ones with exaggerated pockets and excess straps, are starting to feel dated.\n\n\"In 2026, utility is still present, but it's much more refined and subtle,\" she said. Instead, consider trying cargo pants with minimal pockets or simple sporty joggers, which can be more versatile for styling.\n\nDistressed denim was all the rage throughout parts of the past decade; however, it's now starting to leave the conversation as people are looking for pants that will last.\n\n\"I think that people have realized that if I had a pair of distressed jeans, they can't wear them more than once or twice — three times tops — in a year because it's gonna look repetitive,\" Okerulu said.\n\nThis year, she said, people are looking to buy into trends that are designed to endure at least a few seasons. Think: Properly tailored trousers or sturdy bootcut denim.\n\nAt the end of the day, she said, \"Ripped jeans are just ripped jeans.\"\n\nThough the fitted bootcut is very much in, the extreme flare pants may be on the decline.\n\n\"Similar to super baggy pants, oversized flare pants tend to dominate an outfit rather than complement it,\" Boyer said. \"The widening at the bottom half of the body can throw off proportions, which prevents a more polished, balanced look that is flattering for most.\"\n\nInstead of being a day-to-day staple, flare pants may be more of a special-occasion kind of garment — after all, they can be good for making a statement at a more formal event.",

    "description": "A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, including battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nThe Energy Department said the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.\n\n“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support for Trump — or lack of it — “rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.\n\nThe ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A separate federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.\n\nA spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.\n\nOfficials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.”\n\nProjects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.\n\nThe cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.\n\nThe city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.\n\nTrump said in an interview last fall with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.\n\nVickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”\n\nThe administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.\n\nAnne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.\n\n“Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible,” she said.",

    "description": "Kim Kardashian's trainer Senada Greca said five minutes of exercise a day is enough to get started to build strength, burn fat, and boost longevity.",
    "fullText": "When I talk to Senada Greca, she's gearing up to hit the gym with Kim Kardashian: household name, noted entrepreneur — and, apparently, an absolute beast at strength training.\n\nKardashian hits the weights for hours a week, said Greca, her personal trainer, on the phone with me just minutes before her session with the celeb.\n\n\"I love working with Kim. She is an incredibly dedicated woman in all aspects of her life, including strength training,\" she told me.\n\nOn this particular day, Kardashian's workout was going to focus on upper body and core, featuring moves like assisted pull-ups and hollow-body holds. The exercises are paired one after another in a time-saving workout technique called a superset that works the whole body to up the intensity and burn fat.\n\n\"We keep it moving. We don't take too many breaks,\" said Greca, who's been working with her since 2023.\n\nThe sessions are about 90 minutes each, including a warm-up and stretching. They train four to six days a week. Kardashian likes to push herself, and would hit the gym every single day, if not for her trainer urging her to \"take a chill pill\" and rest.\n\nBut you don't have to spend that long in the gym to get major benefits from strength training, according to Greca.\n\nThe trainer said her own personal routine is all about consistency, even if that means working out just five or 10 minutes at a time.\n\nAs a result, Greca is in the best shape of her life at 43.\n\n\"It's about showing up for yourself every single day till it becomes a non-negotiable,\" she said.\n\nShe shared why regular strength training should be a part of your routine for a longer, healthier life, and how to get results starting with just minutes a day.\n\nThe past few years have seen a massive spike of interest in strength training, particularly among women.\n\nThat's for good reasons: lifting weights can boost longevity, improve mood and energy, and sculpt an athletic physique all at once.\n\nGreca, who immigrated to the US as a teen and earned an MBA, said strength training changed her life. She initially pursued a career in finance, but struggled with low self-esteem and an eating disorder. About a decade ago, her doctor helped her reframe exercise as a form of self-care and empowerment.\n\n\"That's when everything kind of changed. I was utilizing workouts to not punish myself, but to nourish myself, to work on my health, my longevity, and my mental state, and everything has been a lot more stable since,\" Greca said.\n\nFrom there, she pivoted to building a fitness empire, attracting more than 6 million Instagram followers with her daily workouts and meal ideas. In recent years, she's launched a strength training app, WeRise, and co-founded supplement company Aonic.\n\nHer passion is helping clients feel strong and capable, making fitness more accessible to everyone from CEOs to stay-at-home moms.\n\n\"I think of strength training as a standard that every woman should embrace,\" she said.\n\nIf you want to start building lean muscle on a busy schedule, a bodyweight circuit is a great option, Greca said.\n\nHer go-to plan takes just five minutes with minimal or no equipment, and hits every major muscle group.\n\nTo try it, perform the following exercises for 45 seconds at a time, resting for 15 seconds between movements:\n\nRepeat for five rounds. If you're feeling motivated or want to increase the challenge, add weights.\n\nRemember, it takes time and consistency to see results. Five minutes alone may not transform your body or health, especially overnight, but it adds up over time as it becomes a habit you can build upon.\n\nGreca said it's important to continue challenging yourself gradually, stay moving outside the gym by walking regularly (especially in nature), and listen to your body.\n\n\"I don't push beyond what my body finds necessary,\" she said. \"I always tell people, listen to the expert within.",

    "fullText": "If you're reading this, you probably have more money on hand than YouTube billionaire MrBeast.\n\nThe world's biggest YouTuber, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, has said he owns more than half of his business, which was valued at $5 billion in its latest funding round. But a hefty net worth doesn't always translate to cash.\n\n\"I have negative money right now,\" Donaldson said in a Wall Street Journal video interview published in early January. \"I'm borrowing money right now — that's how little money I have.\"\n\nDonaldson also said that \"technically, everyone watching this video has more money than me,\" though the self-made billionaire suspected that some people wouldn't believe him.\n\n\"It's funny talking about my personal finances, because no one ever believes anything I say,\" Donaldson said.\n\nMrBeast made a similar point last summer when he said he had to borrow money from his mom for his wedding, adding that he had \"very little money\" since he tries to \"reinvest everything.\"\n\n\"I'm so busy working, I don't really think about my personal bank account,\" Donaldson told the WSJ.\n\nDonaldson's lack of dollars may come as a surprise to fans who have watched him hand out wads of cash to strangers and stand on a pyramid of money. However, MrBeast's company, Beast Industries, is still a startup, and cash flow can be a problem for executives at young companies that aren't publicly traded and have fewer lanes to liquidate their stock.\n\nA lack of cash on hand hasn't stopped Donaldson from splurging occasionally. The YouTuber said he once rented a private jet for about $150,000 to visit his then-girlfriend (now-fiancée), Thea Booysen, in the United Kingdom.\n\nDonaldson is known to drop millions of dollars on YouTube videos, too, which former staffers said he would sometimes kill entirely if they didn't meet his quality standards. The YouTuber said that despite Amazon paying him for his Prime Video show, \"Beast Games,\" he overspent and ended up losing tens of millions of dollars on the first season.\n\nHis company, Beast Industries, has made a push over the last year to reduce unnecessary spending, following a loss of over $100 million in its media division in 2024.\n\nDonaldson has made personal finance a growing portion of his brand.\n\nHe's looking to start Beast Financial, a banking and financial advisory venture. The YouTuber also said he wants to launch a YouTube channel featuring personal finance videos to help educate his viewers on how to handle money.\n\nFinancial content \"just feels like a nice fit for us because we do so much with money,\" Donaldson told creator Jon Youshaei.",

    "title": "This 24-year-old founded a sneaker wholesale company that made $40 million in sales revenue last year — here's how he did it",
    "description": "Oscar Rachmansky, 24, was selling sneakers as a side hustle when he spotted a business opportunity that would become a multimillion-dollar company.",
    "fullText": "Whenever an idea pops into Oscar Rachmansky's head, he whips out a notebook or whatever scrap of paper is closest and writes it down. It's a habit you might expect from a Gen Xer or elder millennial clinging to analog comfort. Rachmansky is neither.\n\nHe's 24, and the company he founded about five years ago generated $40 million in sales revenue in 2025 (confirmed from documents reviewed by Business Insider).\n\nGoing against the grain is kind of Rachmansky's thing.\n\nWhen he was 4, he opened a sunflower seed stand while the other kids sold lemonade. As a teenager, he dropped out of college to pursue a business opportunity that he's since developed into a multimillion-dollar company.\n\nRachmansky launched OS Group in 2019, before he'd turned 20. The company is a B2B wholesaler of branded footwear and streetwear that he bootstrapped from the ground up, he said.\n\nWhat started with sneaker sales out of his bedroom has turned into a team of 30 employees distributing about 25,000 items a month from a large New Jersey warehouse. Rachmansky says he always thought he'd run his own business someday. He just didn't expect it to involve so many sneakers.\n\nGrowing up, Rachmansky was a sports kid who imagined himself running a sports agency one day. \"I certainly wasn't at all interested in fashion, sneakers, or anything of the sort,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nStill, he began buying and selling sneakers in high school as a side hustle. As he learned the resale market, one thing stood out. \"No one was paying attention to the B2B side of this industry,\" he said. \"And that's what powers the entire market.\"\n\nHe launched his B2B company shortly after enrolling at McGill University. His first resale client quickly revealed how fragmented the supply chain was, with retailers jumping through hoops just to source inventory, he said. The inefficiency was obvious. So was the scale.\n\nThen COVID-19 hit. The resale market froze. Rachmansky said he wasn't making any money and briefly considered walking away. \"I was like, well, maybe it wasn't meant to be, maybe I should just keep studying and figure out what happens.\"\n\nCollege, however, never felt like the long-term plan. Within his first month at McGill, he said he opened his notebook and wrote a prediction: \"This is going to be my first and last year of college.\"\n\nRachmansky dropped out of McGill and reinvested the roughly $30,000 he'd earned from his sneaker side hustle into expanding OscarSoles — now OS Group. \"I knew that the industry was growing, and I just wanted to go all in,\" he said.\n\nAt first, the company operated with more hustle than infrastructure.\n\n\"The first warehouse that we had, we didn't even have offices,\" said Isaac Murov, one of OS Group's original employees, who joined the company in 2021. \"We actually made cubicles out of Nike Air Force boxes, so we could have a little bit of privacy,\" he added.\n\nMurov met Rachmansky through a mutual friend, and the two hit it off quickly. \"He was always a very bright individual, and I think I gravitated toward him for that exact reason,\" Murov said.\n\nEven as the resale market cooled after the pandemic, OS Group continued to grow. Rachmansky credits his team above all else. \"We've been really, really intentional with our hiring,\" he said, focusing on people with good attitudes who are coachable and fast.\n\nThat growth came with its own learning curve, though. For the first several years, Rachmansky said, he worked 15-hour days. \"I've always kind of associated output with input — more hours equals better output,\" he said. Eventually, however, he learned that working harder wasn't always the same as working smarter. An early focus on hiring people who added value and growth to the team helped him see that.\n\nThe company's hustle culture was also shaped early on by Rachmansky's willingness to do whatever the job required. \"He always led by example,\" Murov said. \"Whether that was packing boxes in the back, he was never really above that.\"\n\nToday, Rachmansky wants to take OS Group beyond footwear and past pure transaction volume. His goal is to turn the company into a long-term operating partner, offering services like financing, logistics, and software using the infrastructure OS Group has already built internally. \"We really see ourselves as growing into a real operating partner for this industry,\" he said, with the ambition of building \"the entire B2B ecosystem.\"\n\nRachmansky no longer works 15-hour days and says he has a better work-life balance. \"A fear that motivates me is not being able to do everything that I want to do with my life,\" Rachmansky said, adding that he hopes to travel",

    "title": "3 reasons it was a smart leadership move for Powell to release a video",
    "description": "Powell's rare video response allowed him to take control of the narrative — and shows he's willing to make a stand on certain issues.",
    "fullText": "Jerome Powell broke his silence on Sunday — this time on camera.\n\nIn a rare move, the Federal Reserve Chair released a video message after he said the central bank had received grand jury subpoenas that could lead to a criminal indictment.\n\nPowell said the subpoenas related to his June testimony about renovation projects at the Fed's offices, and Trump's administration used the move as pressure to lower interest rates.\n\nFormer Fed chairs and several business leaders have responded critically to the news, and Trump has denied knowledge of the DOJ investigation. For Powell, who rarely reacts to Trump, the public response — and the video format itself — sent a signal.\n\nPowell has typically avoided responding publicly to Trump's attacks, reinforcing the image of the Fed's independence. Opting to make a video statement was a way to project calm, while signaling the stakes of the situation, said communications and leadership experts.\n\nHere are three reasons Powell's video was a power move:\n\nIn the roughly two-minute-long video, Powell emphasized what he said was driving the DOJ probe.\n\n\"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions, or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,\" Powell said.\n\nHis message has already amassed more than 875,000 views on YouTube in under 24 hours. In an age of social media virality, the video format allows him to control the narrative with no intermediary. It also lets him keep up with Trump, who is especially active on social media.\n\nPowell was smart to opt for a video instead of a written statement, in part because news and social media are increasingly visually oriented, Matthew Lombard, chair of the Department of Media Studies and Production at Temple University, said in an email to Business Insider. Journalists and commentators are more likely to use material that comes with images and video, he said.\n\n\"Video, especially when the person directly addresses the camera as he did, is more likely to evoke a sense of presence,\" Lombard said. That makes it more likely the message will land, he said.\n\nIt delivers a \"visceral, 'he's talking to me' perception,\" Lombard said.\n\nChelsea Butkowski, an assistant professor of communication at American University, told Business Insider that Powell's decision to release a short video made it more likely to be shared on platforms like Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and TikTok.\n\nPowell's steady eye contact and a consistent tone of voice will likely help capture viewers' attention and also underscore his authority, said Butkowski.\n\nWhile he makes a firm statement, he keeps it short and to the point. Powell's delivery communicates his independence and measured demeanor in a time of chaos.\n\n\"He's really projecting a sense of stability; a sense of strength here,\" she said.\n\nGiven that Powell has built a reputation for not responding to Trump's insults, his selective responsiveness sends a message that this is a significant issue for him.\n\nWhere he filmed the video also matters, says Butkowski. She said that Powell's decision to record the video before a blue curtain with the US flag in the background was likely designed to evoke tradition, while reaching the public in a modern, direct way.\n\n\"He's essentially saying, 'I'm establishment. I've been here through various administrations, and this one is not going to change the way that I communicate,'\" Butkowski said.",

    "description": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg launches Meta Compute, a major AI infrastructure initiative led by executives Santosh Janardhan and Daniel Gross.",
    "fullText": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Monday that the company is launching a new \"top-level\" initiative called Meta Compute, as it pours more money into the data centers and infrastructure powering its AI push.\n\nZuckerberg said Meta plans to build \"tens of gigawatts\" of capacity this decade and \"hundreds of gigawatts or more\" over time.\n\n\"How we engineer, invest, and partner to build this infrastructure will become a strategic advantage,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nThe move signals that Zuckerberg views AI infrastructure as a key competitive advantage and is placing it under a dedicated unit that reports directly to him. Meta has said it plans to invest $600 billion in US infrastructure and jobs, including AI data centers, by 2028.\n\nThe Department of Energy provides a few handy comparisons for the amount of power in one gigawatt: It's roughly half the output of the Hoover Dam, or the power of 2,627 Tesla Model 3s. Famously, the DeLorean, the iconic time machine in \"Back To The Future Part II,\" needed 1.21 gigawatts to travel through time.\n\nSantosh Janardhan, the company's head of infrastructure, and Daniel Gross, who joined Meta last year from AI startup Safe Superintelligence, will lead the new Meta Compute initiative.\n\nThe two executives will work closely with Dina Powell McCormick, Meta's newly appointed president and vice chairperson, who will focus on partnering with governments and sovereign entities to help build and finance infrastructure. Powell McCormick is a former deputy national security advisor to President Donald Trump and spent 16 years at Goldman Sachs.\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "A neurosurgeon ended up buying two dogs from Svalinn, a high-end protection dog breeder. He says the pets are worth the price.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Dr. Reg Haid. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, my wife, Mary Ellen, and I were without a dog. That was unusual for us: Mary Ellen grew up with German Shepherds. I'd always had sporting dogs — labs and spaniels that could hunt with me. My last dog was a 25-pound Boykin Spaniel who was beautiful, but not very smart.\n\nWe have a property in Montana, so we had heard of Svalinn, a high-end protection dog breeder, and were accustomed to seeing the dogs around. One day, Mary Ellen suggested we go take a look at Svalinn. I told her, \"I'm not getting one of those dogs.\"\n\nAs a doctor, I've stitched up kids with dog bites. In the military, I saw how fearsome dogs can be. I didn't want an aggressive dog. Yet, I went along to the Svalinn ranch because Mary Ellen asked me to.\n\nWhen we got there, one of the dogs came up, kissed me, and put his head in my lap. That's when I started to change my mind.\n\nWe left, but I couldn't get that dog out of my head. I felt he had real intellect, which gave him the ability to connect with me emotionally. I needed him, especially during the lonely days of the pandemic.\n\nMary Ellen and I spent $75,000 on that dog, Elias, who is now 8. The Svalinn team brought him to our cabin for Christmas, and he was loving, gentle, and playful with our children and grandchildren. He immediately became part of the family. I was so smitten that I paid extra — $125,000, at the time — to get the pick of the next litter. Our second Svalinn dog, Rooster, is 4.\n\nI'm embarrassed to say how much I spent on the dogs. I grew up very poor, on a West Virginia farm with no plumbing or heat. I couldn't fathom spending six figures on a dog. However, I've been very fortunate in life to have achieved financial success, first as a neurosurgeon and now as a consultant to a medical device manufacturer. I have the financial means, and the value propositions of these dogs are just amazing. I drive a Ford truck and don't spend money on fancy clothes, but I'm glad I spend it on my dogs.\n\nAs a man, I don't worry much about my safety. The one time I've felt protected by my dogs was during one of our frequent hikes in Montana. They started acting alert. I didn't wait to find out what was going on — I just got out of there.\n\nMary Ellen really appreciates having the dogs as deterrents and protection. I travel for work, and she never worries about being home alone with Elias and Rooster sleeping in our room. I've noticed that if something startles Mary Ellen, the dogs become very attentive and engaged.\n\nWhen Elias was delivered, Mary Ellen and I did two days of work with Svalinn trainers, where we learned how to handle him. I work with them daily to keep them up to date with their commands, and we return to the Svalinn ranch at least once a year to work with their trainers. It's an awesome couple of hours learning together. These dogs don't just require a financial investment; they also require an emotional and time investment.\n\nAs an equestrian, there's a feeling when you're riding a really intelligent horse that's transcendent. That's the closest I can come to describing the value of Svalinn dogs. Quite frankly, there's an emotional connection that I didn't anticipate. I never knew I could love a dog so much.\n\nIf I had read this five years ago, I would have thought, \"This guy's crazy.\" I know how it sounds, but Elias and Rooster are just different. They have all of the benefits of having a dog with none of the inconvenience: no barking or misbehavior. The intellect and emotional intelligence they have are worth every penny.",

    "description": "Trump called for interest on credit cards to be capped for a year. UBS thinks that would end up hurting credit availability for some borrowers.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump's idea to cap credit card interest could have far-reaching unintended consequences, UBS said on Monday.\n\nOn Friday, Trump posted on Truth Social that he was calling for a one-year, 10% rate cap for credit card interest, stating that the industry has been taking advantage of consumers.\n\nThe idea sparked a sell-off in major financial stocks on Monday, including Capital One, Synchrony Financial, JPMorgan, and Citigroup.\n\nWhile investors reacted to the latest threat to lenders' bottom line, UBS said that Trump's plan would have a negative impact on Main Street despite its intention to relieve high borrowing costs for many Americans.\n\nUBS analyst Erika Najarian said that the proposed credit card rate cap would likely backfire, as it would likely reduce consumer spending and curtail lending to certain borrower groups.\n\nNajarian said that credit card providers are more likely to dial back the availability of credit to certain borrowers, rather than simply offer cheaper credit.\n\n\"It is pretty clear that a 10% credit card rate cap would cut off credit availability to those that need it most: middle- and lower-income Americans,\" she added.\n\nThe team of analysts at UBS said that while they see a low likelihood of the plan becoming law, the overall impact on credit availability would be felt by both investors and consumers.\n\n\"According to the Boston Fed, the aggregate credit card spend by annual household income was as follows in May '25: 1) <$39k: ~$26bn; 2) $59-83k: ~$37bn; 3) >$121k: $175bn. Based on Boston Fed data, this means 26% of credit card spend, at least, would be at severe risk, implying a major impact on the economy.\"\n\nThe analysts noted that consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP on average. Additionally, credit card spending accounts for nearly half of Visa's payment volume and more than half of Mastercard's. The kind of pullback predicted by UBS could severely compromise US economic growth.\n\nNajarian isn't the only finance pro to suggest that Trump's credit card rate cap plan could backfire. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman described it as a \"mistake\" and claimed that millions of credit cards could be cancelled as a result.",

    "description": "George and Amal Clooney are the ultimate power couple, both in their careers and fashion. Together, they've shown great style for more than 10 years.",
    "fullText": "Few celebrity couples are at the level of George and Amal Clooney.\n\nThe actor and lawyer have been married for over a decade, during which time they've both remained at the top of their fields. They're also extremely stylish. Talk about a power couple.\n\nHere's a look at the best style moments they've had together.\n\nThey attended an event in Florence, Italy, while wearing matching black ensembles.\n\nAmal stunned in a strapless gown with sparkles on the back of her skirt, and George donned a tuxedo with a satin tie.\n\nAmal especially stood out in a red, strapless ball gown custom-made for her by Margiela and John Galliano. It had a paillette-covered bodice and an asymmetrical tiered skirt.\n\nGeorge's look was also special. He wore a black jacket that was cropped in front and longer in the back, as well as a white button-up with a matching bow tie. The actor completed his look with a red pocket square that matched his wife's dress.\n\nGeorge looked relaxed in a white button-up shirt, light jeans, brown boots, and a metallic watch. Amal, however, seemed ready to party.\n\nShe wore a gold minidress covered in sequins, as well as black pointed pumps and stud earrings.\n\nAmal looked stunning in a sleeveless black dress covered in dazzling sequins. The gown's skirt also had a sheer overlay made from tulle that reached the floor.\n\nGeorge, on the other hand, wore a black tuxedo with a matching shirt and tie.\n\nAt the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, George and Amal walked the red carpet in elegant evening wear.\n\nThe British-Lebanese barrister wore a yellow Versace dress with a single strap and thin train, while her actor husband looked dapper in a black tuxedo with a white shirt and black bow tie.\n\nGeorge wore his standard tuxedo and bow tie for the event, keeping all eyes on his wife.\n\nShe walked alongside him in a strapless gown with a white bodice and tiered skirt crafted from white, gray, and black feathers.\n\nOn the red carpet that day, George was photographed smiling in his black tuxedo while seemingly drawing attention to his wife.\n\nAmal, on the other hand, posed for photographs to show off her Richard Quinn ensemble, consisting of a silver top, navy pants, and a floral skirt made from tinfoil.\n\nDesigned by Stella McCartney, Amal's yellow dress had short sleeves, a midi skirt, and a tie that extended behind her. It paired perfectly with her gold heels and matching yellow hat.\n\nGeorge complemented her outfit with his gray suit, white shirt, and pale-yellow tie.\n\nWhile George wore a classic tuxedo and bow tie, Amal donned a strapless white gown with a floor-length cape that covered her arms and shoulders.\n\nAmal's take on the look included a navy jumpsuit with wide-legged pants and an asymmetrical bodice. She also wore a thick black belt, pointed pumps, and a printed clutch.\n\nGeorge took a similar approach and wore a loose-fitting black suit with a half-unbuttoned shirt underneath.\n\nIn October 2021, they attended the premiere of \"The Tender Bar\" together.\n\nAmal wore a black dress with a silver sequined pattern. It was strapless, with a high-low skirt and thin slits at her hips.\n\nGeorge complemented her look in his classic style: a deep-gray suit with a black button-up shirt.\n\nWalking arm in arm, the couple was photographed wearing elegant looks. George donned a black tuxedo, while Amal wore a strapless gown covered in white sequins.\n\nShe completed the latter outfit with white pumps and a feather shawl.\n\nAtelier Versace designed Amal's dress, which was sleeveless with layers of gold beads arranged in an intricate pattern from top to bottom. The gown also had a slit in the middle of its skirt that revealed Amal's silver sandals.\n\nGeorge, on the other hand, wore a classic tuxedo with a bow tie and dress shoes.\n\nAmal's dress, designed by Del Core, stood out on the red carpet. It was crafted from green and tan tulle, with a strapless neckline and a diamond-shaped cutout at her chest.\n\nShe completed the look with a green clutch and diamond earrings, while George kept things simple in his standard tuxedo.\n\nGeorge wore a traditional suit with a rainbow-colored neckpiece on the red carpet.\n\nAmal, on the other hand, chose an off-the-shoulder Valentino gown embellished with crystals. She also wore a diamond bracelet, pointed heels, and deep-red lipstick.\n\nWhile George wore a simple black outfit — a blazer, dress pants, and button-up top — Amal took a lighter approach.\n\nShe wore a peach, sleeveless gown with a lace-lined neckline and tulle skirt, playing into the ballet-inspired fashion trend that was popular in 2023. The vintage dress was designed by Christian Dior.\n\nWhile George donned a classic black tuxedo and bow tie, Amal walked beside him in a muted-yellow Versace gown. The dress was made with netting and lace and featured a train that flowed behind her.\n\nThe couple walked the red carpet ahead of a \"Jay Kelly\" screening — a comedy-drama starring George.\n\nHe wore a black tuxedo with satin lapels and matching stripes down each trouser leg. He also donned a matching bow tie.\n\nAmal, on the other hand, wore a vintage Jean-Louis Scherrer gown in fuchsia. It was strapless and featured a ruched bodice that was lined with buttons. It also had a thick, puffy train that fanned around her as she walked.\n\nAmal wore a vintage Balmain gown in red, which was sleeveless with a sweetheart neckline and a ruched skirt. Its vibrant color stood out against her husband's classic black tuxedo.\n\nBefore walking the 2026 carpet, their last appearance at the Golden Globes was in 2015.\n\nGeorge ditched his bow tie and swapped his tuxedo for a more casual suit after the Golden Globes. He also wore a black undershirt instead of a white one.\n\nAmal, on the other hand, changed into a lime-colored minidress from Versace that was held together with safety pins.",

    "title": "The controversy behind Jerome Powell's Senate testimony, from the VIP dining room to the special elevators",
    "description": "Jerome Powell says the criminal investigation centers on a June Senate hearing, where he got into a heated exchange over the Fed's renovation plans.",
    "fullText": "In an extraordinary video Sunday night, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said he had been served with grand jury subpoenas as part of a criminal investigation into his testimony about the Fed's Washington, DC, headquarters.\n\nWhile much has been made over whether the probe is a pretext for President Donald Trump to remove Powell as Fed chairman, far less attention has been paid to what Powell actually said in the June Senate testimony that sparked the Justice Department investigation.\n\nWhile criminal probes and grand jury hearings are tightly guarded secrets, here is what we know so far:\n\nAt the June hearing, Powell got into a heated exchange with Sen. Tim Scott, the Republican chair of the Senate banking committee, who criticized the Federal Reserve for \"lavish renovations\" of its main offices.\n\nPowell's responses to Scott's questions prompted one of Trump's allies in the House of Representatives to send a criminal referral to the Justice Department, accusing Powell of perjury.\n\nIn one of the statements singled out by Rep. Anna Paulina Luna as potentially perjurious, Powell said one of the Federal Reserve's buildings never had a \"serious\" renovation. Luna said the building was renovated between 1999 and 2003.\n\nLuna also accused Powell of making a false statement during an exchange with Scott when Powell denied the Federal Reserve would implement some of the more opulent-sounding features it had previously planned.\n\nAt the Senate hearing, Scott pressed Powell with questions about a planning document that said the central bank's historic Marriner S. Eccles building would install \"rooftop garden terraces\" and \"ornate water features,\" as well as new elevators for board members to take to a \"VIP dining suite.\"\n\nPowell dismissed Scott's comments about the project as \"flatly misleading.\"\n\nThe Eccles building had been using the same elevator since the building was built in the 1930s, he said. Other issues Scott raised were \"no longer in the plans,\" Powell told him.\n\n\"There's no special elevators. There are old elevators that have been there,\" he said. \"There are no new water features. There's no beehives, and there's no roof terrace gardens.\"\n\nPowell testified before the Senate Banking Committee in June, following the Federal Reserve's semiannual report, where he discussed the challenges of using interest rates to combat inflation, which he said could remain high due to Trump's tariff policies.\n\nAside from his criticism of the central bank's slow movement on interest rates, Scott criticized the more than $2 billion plan to renovate the Eccles building and the 1951 Constitution Avenue building. He said the changes to those offices \"feel more like they belong in the Palace of Versailles.\"\n\nPowell told senators that the Eccles building had long been in need of renovation for safety reasons. The renovation began in 2022 and is overseen by members of the Federal Reserve board, who are all confirmed by the Senate. Trump nominated Powell himself in his first term in 2017.\n\n\"When I was the administrative governor, before I became chair, I came to understand how badly the Eccles building really needed a serious renovation,\" he said. \"Never had one. It was not really safe and it was not waterproof.\"\n\nThe following month, Luna said Powell had broken the law by perjuring himself and making false statements to Congress.\n\nShe sent a criminal referral to Attorney General Pam Bondi, asking the Justice Department to open an investigation into the Federal Reserve chairman.\n\nIt isn't clear if Luna's referral formed the basis for the ongoing criminal investigation into Powell. A representative for the US Attorney's Office in Washington, DC, declined to comment.\n\nLuna's letter said Powell's statements at the hearing contradicted a Federal Reserve planning document, which said the central bank's buildings would get new rooftop gardens, outdoor water jets, and a private dining room.\n\nA spokesperson for Luna said her letter relied on the same 2021 document that Scott had asked Powell about in the June hearing.\n\nPowell told the senator the renovation project had already scrapped some luxurious-sounding features and that the plans had \"continued to evolve.\"\n\nThe renovation would be thrifty with building materials, Powell said.\n\n\"There's no new marble,\" he said. \"We took down the old marble, we're putting it back up. We'll have to use new marble where some of the old marble broke.\"\n\nA two-page fact sheet on the Federal Reserve's website about the renovations of the two historic buildings reiterates what Powell said. \"No new VIP dining rooms are being constructed as part of the project,\" \"There is no VIP elevator,\" \"There are no new water features,\" some bullet points read.\n\nLuna also said Powell lied to Congress when he said the Federal Reserve's Eccles building had \"never had\" a \"serious renovation.\"\n\n\"This statement is also false,\" Luna wrote. \"The Federal Reserve Board conducted a comprehensive renovation of the Eccles Building from 1999 to 2003, which included the replacement of the roof, all major systems, and a full refurbishing of interior and courtyard spaces.\"\n\nLuna accused Powell of making another false statement to Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought when he wrote a letter saying changes to the construction plans were intended to \"simplify construction and reduce the likelihood of further delays and cost increases.\"\n\nTrump has denied knowing about the DOJ's probe, but he has not been shy about voicing his dissatisfaction with the Federal Reserve for not lowering interest rates faster.\n\nHe has said he would like to fire Powell, and made the unusual move of announcing plans to select Powell's replacement ahead of the expiration of Powell's 10-year term in 2028. Trump has also attempted to fire Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee on the Federal Reserve board, in a case that will be heard before the Supreme Court next week.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's renovation plans have irked Trump, who complained about the project's cost during a July tour of the construction site with Powell and Scott.\n\nIn his statement Sunday, Powell said the Justice Department subpoena \"should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\n\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings,\" he said, adding, \"Those are pretexts.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with a comment from a Rep. Luna spokesperson.",

    "description": "Cloudflare data shows the top AI labs are strip-mining the web, and it's getting worse not better.",
    "fullText": "Are AI giants nurturing the web, the most valuable store of human data the world will ever see? Or are they scraping content for free and giving little back? Updated data from Cloudflare sheds new light on this important question.\n\nThis is one of the most under-discussed parts of the AI revolution. While tech companies spend lavishly on data centers, GPUs, and talent, they avoid talking about the other key ingredient of AI success: data.\n\nThat's because they don't want to pay for the high-quality human data that's needed for AI model training, inference, and AI outputs. Instead, they send out bots to crawl websites and scoop up this information, mostly for free.\n\nIn the past, tech companies would send users to the original sources of this information. This formed the grand bargain of the web. Sites would let their data be taken for free on the understanding that they would get referrals in return, and could pay for their efforts through advertising, subscriptions, and other techniques.\n\nIn the new generative AI world, this deal is breaking down. Now, AI answer engines and chatbots give users direct answers, making people less likely to visit the websites that created and verified the data in the first place.\n\nCloudflare, which helps run about 20% of the world's websites, began tracking this behavior in 2025. It measures Big Tech company bots' requests to crawl websites, and the number of referrals the platforms send to sites.\n\nThis crawl-to-refer ratio is a useful guide to how much tech companies are taking from the web and how much they're giving back. For example, a ratio of 100 to 1 would mean a company's bots crawled sites 100 times for every 1 referral they send.\n\nIs this one way to measure how ethical companies are in the AI era? I'll leave you to decide. Here's the data for the first week in January.\n\nAs you can see, Anthropic stands out like a sore thumb. According to Cloudflare data, it crawls sites way more than it sends users out to the web. Anthropic actually crawled even \n\nThe same applies to OpenAI; its crawl-to-refer ratio has worsened. Again, this suggests that OpenAI is taking more value from the web and giving less value back.\n\nThis aligns with Business Insider reporting from late 2024. Back then, we told you that bots from Anthropic and OpenAI, especially, were crawling some websites so much that it was causing their traffic costs to spike dramatically.\n\nOne web developer saw a client's cloud-computing costs double within a few months due to this AI bot swarm, according to BI reporting.\n\nSo, not only are AI companies taking from the web and giving less back — they are also leaving some site owners with bigger bills to pay.\n\nLike last quarter, I asked Anthropic why it crawls so much and gives so little back to the web. The startup did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nBack in September, Anthropic said it couldn't confirm the crawl-to-refer ratios calculated by Cloudflare and said there may be \"issues\" with the methodology. At that time, Anthropic also noted that it launched a web search feature for its popular Claude AI chatbot earlier this year. This was generating more referral traffic for websites now, and this is growing quickly, the startup said back then.\n\nOpenAI didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nA caveat: The numbers that go into the crawl-to-refer ratio focus on the web and exclude native app activity. If app activity were included, the ratios might be lower. However, this methodology applies to all the companies included in this ranking.\n\nGoogle's relatively low ratio is likely due to its traditional search engine, which still shows clear website links in many results. However, the company is increasingly weaving in AI chatbot-style answers into its search service, via AI Overviews and AI mode.\n\nGoogle has been saying lately that it still sends traffic to the web, and it cares about the health of this ecosystem.\n\nBusiness Insider will keep tracking this Cloudflare data in the coming months and quarters to see how this behavior evolves.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

Lower courts have found those tariffs to be illegal, and bettors on prediction market sites like Polymarket and Kalshi currently put the odds of a ruling against Trump at around 70%.\n\nIf that happens, the US may have to refund the billions of dollars in revenue that the government has collected from the IEEPA tariffs.\n\nTrump argued that the amount was worth \"Trillions of Dollars\" when accounting for investments that US companies have made to avoid tariffs.\n\n\"It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay,\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump's comments are at odds with what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said about potential tariff refunds over the weekend, when he told Reuters that it \"won't be a problem if we have to do it.\"",

    "title": "Why the attack on Fed Chair Jerome Powell follows Donald Trump's typical playbook — and isn't going to stop there",
    "description": "The Federal Reserve is supposed to be independent from the president. The Justice Department investigation into Jerome Powell could change that.",
    "fullText": "Donald Trump wants Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, to do something Powell doesn't want to do.\n\nNow, Trump's federal prosecutors are now investigating Powell.\n\nThat's the shortest version of the news story that broke Sunday night, when Powell released an extraordinary statement and video, which I urge you to watch and read for yourself.\n\nKey quote from Powell, who Trump picked as Fed chair in 2017: \"This unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\n\n(Trump told NBC on Sunday that he didn't have any knowledge of the investigation and that the DOJ wasn't trying to pressure Powell into lowering interest rates. If you find that hard to believe, you might point to the fact that the investigation was reportedly authorized by US Attorney Jeanine Pirro, the former Fox News anchor who is a longtime Trump ally.)\n\nAs Powell notes, using the threat of a criminal prosecution — fueled by a pretext — to pressure the Fed, which is meant to be independent of the White House but accountable to Congress, is unprecedented.\n\nBut the pattern most definitely has precedent in the Trump administration: Trump will say he wants or needs something to happen, often using fantastical logic to justify it — and then uses coercion to try to make it happen.\n\nIn this case, it's about Trump wanting the Federal Reserve to lower rates. And more broadly, about Trump wanting the Federal Reserve to answer to him.\n\nThat's why, prior to investigating Powell, he has also tried to remove Fed member Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee the Trump administration has accused of mortgage fraud. Cook fought Trump in court, and later this month the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the case — and eventually rule on whether Trump can remove a Fed governor \"for cause.\"\n\nIt's easy to see many other examples of Trump trying the same thing. Trump, for instance, insisted that political enemies like former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James should be prosecuted for … something. And when a Trump-appointed prosecutor declined to bring charges, Trump had him replaced with another appointee who would. Both of those cases have been dismissed by a federal judge, who said Lindsey Halligan, the Trump-installed US attorney who brought the cases, had been unlawfully appointed. The DOJ is appealing.\n\nOftentimes, the reactions to Trump's pressure campaigns amount to a shrug — Democrats complain, Republicans usually back him (or say nothing), and markets move around a bit before reaching a new equilibrium.\n\nMaybe this time will be different: The Fed is supposed to be an institution that investors care about as a steady, guiding hand that doesn't swing wildly with political winds. Markets can ignore a lot of political ugliness; pressure on the Fed is harder to dismiss.\n\nThe broader pattern Powell is underlining goes well beyond monetary policy or even political score-settling. The administration has repeatedly paired aggressive action with a justification that is often strained at best. Prior to the raid that removed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro this month, Trump and his proxies repeatedly insisted that Maduro and his country were killing countless Americans by bringing fentanyl into the US — which is not true. Last week, Kristi Noem, Trump's head of Homeland Security, said the shooting of a Minneapolis woman protesting an ICE raid was justified in part because she was a \"domestic terrorist.\"\n\nSome of you will look at Trump's behavior and find something in there that you like, in an ends justify means formulation. Maduro was a terrible leader, so maybe you think that making up reasons to depose him doesn't matter much. Maybe you like Trump's deportation agenda, and aren't worried about him using masked agents with guns on city streets to make that happen.\n\nGive it time. We're still just a year into the second Trump administration, and his impulse to act without restraint has yet to find real pushback. \"My own morality. My own mind. It's the only thing that can stop me,\" he told The New York Times last week, when asked about the relevance of international laws and treaties. A president with an infinite target list and unchecked power is never finished.",

    "title": "'Heated Rivalry' proves fresh faces can still blow up Hollywood",
    "description": "\"Heated Rivalry\" has become a word-of-mouth hit for HBO Max. Both stars, Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams, were previously unknown to audiences.",
    "fullText": "When Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams made their Golden Globes debut on Sunday, walking onstage to the tune of Chappell Roan's \"Pink Pony Club,\" they were met with a roar of applause so enthusiastic, you'd think they were Oscar frontrunners from a recent blockbuster.\n\n\"You think everyone in the audience has seen 'Heated Rivalry?'\" Williams asked his costar in a lighthearted bit.\n\n\"That's a maybe,\" Storrie replied with mock stoicism. \"But their trainers have, and their moms have, and their daughters have.\"\n\nIf you didn't know who Storrie and Williams were before they were tapped as presenters at the awards ceremony — and, indeed, if you still don't — there's no need to be ashamed. The two actors were largely unknown before they were cast in the Canadian import \"Heated Rivalry,\" a romance drama that HBO head Casey Bloys recently called \"a word-of-mouth sensation\" after its first season debuted on the streamer in late November. The data bears this out: according to data from Luminate, viewership increased tenfold between the premiere and the finale, and the show has continued to accumulate hundreds of millions of viewing minutes even after the season ended in December.\n\nThe show, based on a book series by Rachel Reid, follows Ilya Rozanov (Storrie) and Shane Hollander (Williams), two professional hockey players who embark upon a secret love affair. The series has quickly attracted a devoted following thanks to its steamy sex scenes and the onscreen chemistry between its co-leads.\n\nI can personally vouch for the show's addictive appeal. Before I compulsively binged all six episodes in a single Saturday evening, declining a friend's invitation to go out because I wanted to keep watching, I'd been asked about the show by no fewer than six people. These questions were usually phrased as assumptions: \"You've seen 'Heated Rivalry,' right?\"\n\nThis success story is anomalous, not least because the show was made with a relatively scant budget (showrunner Jacob Tierney said production was \"insanely cheap\" by American standards) and no major star power to speak of. Unlike many of their peers at the Golden Globes, before being cast as on-ice rivals and off-ice lovers, Storrie and Williams didn't have massive follower counts on Instagram, viral TikTok videos, or fan bases carried over from past projects — and I can confidently say their low profiles were blessings in disguise.\n\nSure, \"Heated Rivalry\" would've received a bigger marketing push had bigger names been on the poster, but it has delighted viewers and drawn attention regardless. The show's popularity is a testament to the appetite for fresh faces in Hollywood.\n\nThese days, it can feel like the same group of celebrated actors is appearing in a never-ending rotation of blockbusters, regardless of how well they suit the role at hand. (A list of names probably just popped into your head as you read that sentence.)\n\nI can't help but think of last year's announcement that Sam Mendes would make four interconnected Beatles biopics. Instead of trying to find promising newcomers who closely resembled and could embody the famous bandmates, the cast reveal reads like a standard response to the trivia question, \"Which young male actors have the most critical buzz and fanfare right now?\"\n\nIt's not that Paul Mescal (\"Hamnet,\" \"Gladiator II\"), Harris Dickinson (\"Babygirl,\" \"The Iron Claw\"), Joseph Quinn (\"Fantastic Four,\" \"Stranger Things\"), and Barry Keoghan (\"Saltburn,\" Sabrina Carpenter's ex-boyfriend) don't have chops — it's that name recognition almost certainly came into play in casting.\n\nThe most obvious actor missing from that list would be Timothée Chalamet, who helmed his own biopic as Bob Dylan in 2024. His latest release, \"Marty Supreme,\" is a top Oscar contender featuring a terrific lead performance — though one that I decisively associate with the actor's fame, reputation, and enthusiastic marketing campaign. Chalamet is someone I'm very familiar with, even fond of, and I was impressed by his work in the film. Still, this familiarity kept me at arm's length from the character, raising the barrier to suspend my disbelief. While watching, it was difficult for me to see the face of ping-pong player Marty Mauser, and not Chalamet wearing light facial prosthetics.\n\nEven now, after watching interviews and promotional videos of Storrie and Williams as themselves, it hasn't colored my experience of the show. (I just finished my second rewatch.) Their characters exist in the pure realm of my brain's pleasure center, untouched by Hollywood's machinations. When I watch Ilya and Shane kiss on my screen, I don't see two actors putting on a performance or vying for nominations; I see two people in love.\n\nI would hope and assume that opportunities for Storrie and Williams are pouring into their agents' inboxes, so they'll soon have the recognition and buzz that will buoy them into being cast in other projects. Fame awaits them as surely as \"Heated Rivalry\" fans await season two. Still, let their unlikely fairytale inspire more casting agents to take a chance on actors without clout.",

    "description": "Meta's new Checkpoint program restructures worker ratings and incentives, rewarding top performers with up to 300% of their base bonuses.",
    "fullText": "Meta is overhauling how it grades workers and rewarding top performers with up to 300% of their base bonuses, according to internal screenshots of a memo sent to employees on Monday that Business Insider obtained.\n\nThe social media giant is rolling out a new performance program called Checkpoint, which reshapes ratings into four buckets, according to the memo. It will start in \"mid-year 2026,\" aiming to make performance reviews less bureaucratic and more focused on outcomes.\n\n\"The new scale reflects what we know to be true: most people at Meta are high performers who consistently deliver meaningful impact,\" the memo said.\n\nIn particular, Meta said its new system will incentivize the strongest performers with higher bonuses.\n\nHere's how the memo outlines the new distribution and pay multipliers for base bonuses.\n\nAdditionally, Meta says it's introducing a new Meta Award, a 300% individual multiplier for a small number of top performers who deliver \"truly exceptional impact.\"\n\n\"We're evolving our performance program to simplify it and placing greater emphasis on rewarding outstanding performance,\" a Meta spokesperson told Business Insider. \"While our employees have always been held to a high-performance, impact-based culture, this new direction allows for more frequent feedback and recognition in a more efficient way.\"\n\nThe memo says most employees will fall into \"Excellent\" because \"most people at Meta are high-performers who consistently deliver meaningful impact.\"\n\nThe company plans to host a companywide meeting on January 22 to walk employees through the changes and answer questions. The new updates apply to the 2026 performance year and do not affect the current cycle.\n\nMeta pitched the redesign as a time-saver. Managers, the memo says, spend about 80 hours a year on performance-related tasks, while employees collectively spend 330,000 hours per cycle on peer feedback. Yet fewer than 25% of managers say that feedback is helpful, the memo adds.\n\nUnder Checkpoint, Meta will transition to two cycles a year — mid-year and year-end — using the same rating scale in both cycles, with bonuses paid out twice annually. Meta will still deliver equity refresher grants once a year, though they will be based on the average of two performance ratings rather than a single annual rating. Merit increases will happen once a year following the second cycle.\n\nCheckpoint rolled out after Zuckerberg framed 2025 as an \"intense\" year and said Meta would tighten performance management, including cutting about 5% of low performers. In interviews, Meta employees and managers described the result as a tougher, more competitive environment where ratings mattered more than before.\n\nThe new system also streamlines Meta's previous rating system.\n\nEarlier, employees navigated different sets of labels depending on the time of year, including three mid-year buckets (such as \"Exceeds Expectations\" and \"Below Expectations\"), and a more granular year-end ladder that ranged from \"Redefines Expectations\" to \"Does Not Meet Expectations.\"\n\nMeta's latest revamp comes as the company has been tightening performance management in recent years. Meta plans to assess performance by AI-driven impact starting this year, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nLast year, it expanded the number of employees managers are expected to place in the lowest bucket. Meta instructed managers of large teams to rank 15% to 20% of employees as \"below expectations,\" up from 12% to 15% the previous year, after the company had earlier that year cut nearly 4,000 employees it had labeled as low performers, Business Insider reported last May.\n\nOther tech giants, such as Google and Amazon, also revised their performance review systems and pay structures to incentivize top performers. As part of this year's performance review process, Amazon will ask corporate employees to submit three to five \"accomplishments\" that best reflect their work, Business Insider reported.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "It’s all about safety, not comfort.",
    "fullText": "If you’re a frequent flier, it’s all too easy to board your plane and completely zone out. You find your seat, store your luggage, take note of the onboard amenities, and settle in for a, hopefully, smooth ride. But while you’re awaiting takeoff (and the Wi-Fi to kick in), the plane crew is actively at work, monitoring systems and procedures to get you to your destination safely.\n\n“During the critical phases of flight, specifically takeoff and landing, cabin hosts ensure the cabin is fully secure and passengers are seated, briefed, and prepared. This allows full focus on safety during the most sensitive portions of the flight,” Katherine Drossos, a trained flight attendant and in-flight supervisor at Cirrus Aviation Services, tells Travel + Leisure.\n\nPart of that preparation involves the safety briefing. We’re all familiar with the script covering seat belt usage, oxygen masks, and how to find your life vest in case of an emergency water landing. Upon takeoff—and then again at landing—you may also notice the cabin crew taking a certain position while seated. After buckling in, they either sit with their hands beneath their thighs or rest their palms face down on their legs.\n\n“What passengers often interpret as cabin hosts ‘sitting on their hands’ is actually a deliberate brace-ready position. Cabin hosts sit upright in the jump seat with feet flat on the floor and hands secured on their thighs or beneath the legs,” Drossos says. “This posture stabilizes the body, minimizes the risk of injury during sudden movement or turbulence, and ensures hands are immediately available to respond if an evacuation or safety action is required.”\n\nShe also notes that “while exact hand placement or posture may vary slightly by airline or aircraft type,” its purpose is the same: “maintaining stability, alertness, and immediate readiness during the most critical phases of flight.”\n\nWhile in this brace position, the cabin crew is simultaneously performing a mental checklist of sorts. “While seated, cabin hosts also conduct a silent safety review, mentally walking through emergency procedures, identifying exits, and confirming evacuation commands and responsibilities,” she explains.\n\nAs a passenger, you aren’t required to take the same brace position—although you’re certainly welcome to—but there are a few specific ways to keep yourself safe and secure during takeoff and landing. After giving your full attention to the crew’s safety briefing, review the safety card tucked into the seatback in front of you, and keep your seat belt fastened throughout the flight. Your seat should also remain upright during both takeoff and landing.",

    "fullText": "on January 12, 2026 at 12:04PM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons is getting new content for the big 3.0 update arriving on January 15. This is a free update that brings new activities to the island and offers more ways to play with friends. There are even major collaborations with Lego, Splatoon, and The Legend of Zelda. In this guide we'll highlight everything you need to know about Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 update, including details about the new Resort Hotel and customizable islands for multiplayer.\n\nIf you are a new player or someone returning after a long hiatus, make sure you check out our complete guide hub for Animal Crossing: New Horizons. This offers starter tips, help with various features, and information on how to upgrade locations.\n\nWhen your Villager goes to sleep, they can now choose the option \"slumber time\" to go to a new dream world introduced in the 3.0 update.\n\nLuna's Dream World lets you fully customize a brand-new island with items you've previously obtained in game. You can build up to three Slumber Islands and choose from three different island sizes.\n\nWith Slumber Islands, you'll be able to exercise more creative freedom than ever before. You can alter the terrain to remove cliffs and widen rivers to your liking. You'll also have the option to place inclines and bridges. You're not tied to real-world time and weather in Slumber Islands, either. Instead, you can customize these details to create the look you want for your island.\n\nOne of the biggest highlights of Slumber Island is that you can invite or join friends to customize islands together. It's worth noting that you will need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription for online play.\n\nAnother big feature for 3.0 is the Resort Hotel. This new building is located at the end of the pier of your standard island and gives you a variety of guest rooms to decorate.\n\nThis waterfront hotel is run by Kapp'n and his family, and they want you to help decorate rooms to entice guests to stay. You'll earn Hotel Tickets for each room you decorate, a brand-new currency that is used to buy exclusive items added with the big update.\n\nIf you're a fashionista, you can also plan and suggest outfits for the hotel guests to wear during their stay. You can style and place outfits on hotel mannequins that will then be available for both you and your guests to wear.\n\nAs always, Tom Nook finds a new opportunity to make some Bells in the 3.0 update. He sees potential in the new Resort Hotel, but he wants your help to promote it. Craft special DIY items for him, and he'll reward you with more Hotel Tickets.\n\nThe game's previous storage limit was 5,000, but the 3.0 update will expand storage with two additional upgrades for a maximum of 9,000 items. You'll also be able to store trees, flowers, and shrubs.\n\nThe prices haven't been revealed yet, but if they're similar to the 2.0 update, you can expect to spend around 900,000 Bells and 1,200,000 Bells per upgrade.\n\nIt's finally time for easier island clean up. This update introduces Resetti's Reset Service, a new feature that gives you the ability to clear out flowers, furniture, and \n\nThis new cleaning service lets you pick a specific area for Resetti to clean, though you can also ask him to clean the entire island or limit it to just the beach area. You can also ask him to place items in storage after he cleans up. This means if you have a messy flower bed, but don't want to lose all your flowers, he can both remove and save them for you.\n\nAs you help the Resort Hotel, the building's souvenir shop will eventually start selling Nintendo items. You can purchase these exclusive items with the Hotel Tickets you earn.\n\nThese items include retro Nintendo consoles to decorate your home. If you have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, you can even play a retro game on each of the consoles you buy. This includes playing classics such as Dr. Mario and Ice Climber.\n\nIn addition to Nintendo items at the souvenir shop, you can also purchase Lego-themed items from the Nook Shopping app. This will let you decorate your home with Lego brick furniture, such as a sofa, bed, or fireplace. There is also Lego wallpaper and a t-shirt. These items all come in a variety of colors, so you can find something brick-themed to match your style.\n\nYou'll be able to add four Nintendo characters with Update 3.0, if you have their amiibo cards: Mineru and Tulin from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Cece and Viché, who are inspired by Callie and Marie from Splatoon.\n\nTapping their amiibo cards will let you invite them to your island, and it will also unlock unique items in Nook Shopping.",

    "title": "What Counts As Cardio (and What Doesn't)",
    "description": "Walking? Lifting weights? Does it matter what zone you’re in? I have answers.",
    "fullText": "Cardio is good for us. We need both cardio and strength training for basic health, as well as our athletic goals. But what actually counts as cardio? Can you count walking? Lifting weights? Anything so long as you’re in the right zone? Let me break it down.\n\nTrick question! “Cardio” is a nickname for a certain rough category of exercise, and it doesn't have a precise definition. You’ll find different definitions of it depending on who you ask, and a lot of the research on the benefits of cardio just calls it “exercise.\" The closest technical term is \"aerobic activity.\"\n\nThe Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans describes aerobic activity as when:\n\n...the body’s large muscles move in a rhythmic manner for a sustained period of time. Brisk walking, running, bicycling, jumping rope, and swimming are all examples. Aerobic activity causes a person’s heart to beat faster, and they will breathe harder than normal.\n\nThat matches the World Health Organization definition, as well as the way most fitness professionals use the terms \"aerobic\" or \"cardio\" exercise. Note that the key components are:\n\nIt uses large muscles (like the legs; you can’t get cardio by twiddling your thumbs)\n\nIt's rhythmic (as when you pedal a bicycle for hundreds of revolutions)\n\nIt can be sustained (like a 20-minute bike ride, but unlike a set of 10 squats)\n\nExercises that fit the definition include walking, running, cycling, swimming, and using machines like a rower, elliptical, or stair machine at the gym.\n\nNo, there isn’t a strict dividing line between what counts as cardio and what doesn’t. The guidelines I quote above treat “moderate” intensity cardio as the minimum to target, but that’s not defined in terms of heart rate. I have a breakdown here of what “moderate” really means, but briefly: Anything at the effort level of a normal-paced walk (about 20 minutes per mile) is moderate.\n\nI know that’s not the answer you were hoping to find, so here’s another data point: the American Heart Association says that moderate exercise corresponds to 50-70% of your maximum heart rate. (Vigorous is 70-85%.)\n\nMost of us don’t actually know our true max heart rate, and formulas like “220 minus your age” aren’t accurate. So take that with a grain of salt. It’s more helpful to consider how exercise feels: Moderate exercise will get you breathing heavier than at rest, maybe sweating a little bit, and with a noticeably higher heart rate than when you’re sitting quietly. You don’t have to be out of breath; moderate exercise is conversational, in the sense that you could, literally, engage in conversation while you do it.\n\nIf you want to get health benefits from cardio, you may want to pay more attention to intensity. Moderate exercise is great, but vigorous exercise (where it feels hard, and you won’t be able to speak in full sentences) is also excellent to have in the mix. The Norwegian 4x4 is an accessible cardio workout that features plenty of vigorous work.\n\nYes, in the sense that it meets the minimum guidelines. It is moderate intensity exercise and it counts toward your minutes per week (no matter what your heart rate is while you do it).\n\nBut if you have athletic goals, walking alone is probably not enough to achieve them. If walking feels easy, you probably want to increase the intensity to increase your cardio fitness. Jogging or rucking would be good next steps.\n\nNo, lifting weights does not count as cardio (with a few exceptions, which I’ll discuss in a minute.) Remember, cardio has to be rhythmic and sustained. If you aren’t doing the same movement over and over for, say, 10 minutes, it’s not cardio. So three sets of 10 on the chest press machine is definitely not cardio. You probably spent about five minutes in total, most of them resting. Doesn't count.\n\nAnd no, I won’t change my answer based on what your heart rate monitor says. Your heart rate only measures the intensity of cardio exercise if you are doing cardio exercise. Strength training is still strength training (not cardio) no matter what zone your heart rate is in.\n\nSo what are those exceptions I mentioned? Exercising with weights can count as cardio if it meets the definition: rhythmic and sustained. Most people don’t do this! But if you’re training for a kettlebell half marathon, which is 30 minutes of the same motion, continuously, with a light kettlebell (you aren’t allowed to put the kettlebell down until time is up), then yes, that is cardio.\n\nI would also categorize the kettlebell ladder workout as a form of cardio. I do so with reservations—it’s not continuous for the whole 30-ish minutes, but then again neither is a lot of interval training. Kettlebell swings are definitely rhythmic and involve large muscles, and the workout is designed to get your breathing and heartbeat going faster than usual for pretty much the whole time. I’ll allow it.\n\nHigh-intensity interval training definitely taxes your cardiovascular system, but it's not necessarily the best workout when you're looking for a way to get some cardio in. If you're doing true HIIT, it's very intense, very short, and may have longish rest periods in between the hard intervals. You're working your anaerobic system, not just your aerobic capacity, so it has some of the same caveats as lifting weights.\n\nWhat's more, a lot of \"HIIT\" videos out there aren't really HIIT, and aren't even necessarily good cardio. As I've written before, \"HIIT\" seems to mean \"a video with a timer in the corner,\" regardless of what kind of workout you get out of it. If you're looking for a good cardio workout, it's better to find something where you know you'll be working aerobically—which means being able to breathe rather than gasp—throughout the whole workout.\n\nI’ve given some examples already, but let me give you a longer list of things that are definitely cardio, if you do them in any sort of normal way (steady state or intervals, especially if the intervals use active rest like walking).\n\nRunning, jogging, or run/walk intervals (indoor or outdoor)\n\nPaddling or rowing a small boat\n\nDancing (truly the most underrated form of at-home cardio)\n\nStairmaster or stepmill machines\n\nClimbing machines like the Jacob’s Ladder or Versaclimber\n\nRoller skating or rollerblading\n\nYard work or housework that has you moving continuously (like pushing a lawn mower or shoveling snow)\n\nI also have a list of cardio options here that goes into more detail about many of the above, and here’s a list of chores and recreational activities that can also count (although many are moderate level, like walking).\n\nHopefully these examples help you choose some exercise to do. If you have specific athletic goals, though (like running a 5K or passing a fitness test for work) you’ll want to look into a training program that is geared toward those goals.",

    "description": "macOS 26 comes with an interesting (and frustrating) quirk.",
    "fullText": "Apple's latest crop of updates was met with a bit of a mixed reaction. While some users love the new Liquid Glass design across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, others decidedly do not—which is likely what led Apple to introduce a dedicated setting to control the intensity of the effect. I'm partial to it, but I understand for some users, it's a tad too much, especially if it makes certain UI elements more difficult to see.\n\nBut Liquid Glass isn't the only thing Apple users have complained about, especially with regards to macOS Tahoe. Mac users reported various problems with performance and stability across macOS 26.0 and macOS 26.1, and have criticized design choices like overly rounded corners. Myself, I held out on updating my M3 Pro Mac until macOS 26.2, where many of these issues appeared to be fixed, but my M1 iMac is still on macOS Sequoia for the time being. All that to say, macOS 26 hasn't had the smoothest start compared to some of Apple's previous Mac updates. If you've been noticing, for example, that your Mac's window management isn't as cooperative as it's been in the past, you're not alone. In fact, there seems to be a clear explanation for what's behind the issues.\n\nAs with other versions of macOS, you can resize and adjust your Mac apps' windows by clicking and dragging from the bottom corners. The issue, however, is that as of Apple's newest update, it can be fairly difficult to grab the corner of the window. You might, instead, find you click on the bottom corner of the app or website instead, leading to unintended actions. Clicking the top right corner of Chrome, for example, will drag the whole app window, rather than resize it. Clicking the bottom left corner and dragging will start to highlight everything in the app window instead, perhaps sending you all around the screen as well.\n\nIf you slowly hover your cursor over the corner of the window, eventually you'll find a spot that turns your cursor into a resize icon, and you'll know you're good to click and drag to resize. But why is this so much more difficult to do quickly than it was in macOS Sequoia or beyond?\n\nNorbert Heger, a software developer, seemingly has an answer. In a blog post on Sunday, Heger explains that those rounded corners Apple designed for Tahoe are having a negative impact on the clickable area of the window. With a square corner, most of the clickable area—Heger says 62% of it—lies within the corner of the window itself. That gives users a relatively large area to click within the corner in order to grab onto the window, and a little bit of room outside the window to click, as well. But these new rounded corners don't seem to take that into consideration. Instead, they're relying on the same click area as before, but because there's less corner to work with now, the actual clickable area of the window is far less. Heger says about 75% of the clickable area now exists outside the window itself, giving users just 25% to work with in the actual corner of the window.\n\nIf you're running macOS Tahoe, you can try this out for yourself right now: Move your cursor to the corner of the window, and wait for it to change into the resize icon. If you're hovering within the window itself, it won't change until you're just about to move outside the window. You can keep going a bit, and see you can get pretty darn far outside the window before the cursor changes back.\n\nThis seems like a relatively easy fix on Apple's part, assuming they're aware of the issue. Maybe a patch will even make it into macOS 26.3. That said, the company has not publicly acknowledged the quirk, so it's anyone's guess. Until a potential fix, those of us on macOS Tahoe will just need to retrain our muscle memories around window resizing. For anyone who hasn't upgraded yet, you can simply carry on as usual.",

    "fullText": "An arrest report revealed new details about a fight in the stands among fans at TD Garden during Saturday’s Boston Bruins-New York Rangers game that resulted in an arrest and hospitalization.\n\nAaron Tucker, 48, of Barre, Vermont, is slated to be arraigned on Friday on a charge of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury and assault and battery on a person over the age of 60 in connection with the altercation.\n\nAccording to the arrest report, TD Garden detail officers responded to the arena’s Loge 2 section just after 3 p.m. for a report of an unconscious man who had fallen from the balcony level. After officers spoke with witnesses, they learned the victim was actually pushed while standing on the stairs in the section, causing him to fall backwards.\n\nWhen officers and security personnel located the 60-year-old victim, he was lying on the ground, semi-conscious, and breathing with his eyes slightly open near row AA in club section 113, the report stated. While enroute to Mass General Hospital for the treatment of a head injury, he allegedly told emergency officials that he drank “seven beers” and “had no memory” of the incident.\n\nOne witness told police that the victim was intoxicated and agitating Tucker and a woman he was sitting with, at one point raising his middle finger directly in their faces, according to the report. Another witness said Tucker and the victim continued to heckle each other before the push occurred.\n\n“He [witness] observed the victim continue to inch closer to the suspect and his wife, at which point the suspect grabbed the victim by the neck and pushed him, which caused him to fall backwards down the stairs,” police wrote in the report.\n\nNew video obtained by Boston 25 shows Boston police and EMS responding to the chaotic scene.\n\nTucker was wearing a Rangers hat and jersey, and the victim was harassing other Rangers fans leading up to the push, another witness told police. The victim’s friends had also been trying to get him to leave the arena to avoid continued escalation.\n\n“It shouldn’t happen,” a fan told Boston 25 News. “When the Rangers were here, they beat them 10 to 2; that’s when there are more fights.”\n\nOther witnesses reported seeing Tucker walk off toward the club level after the push as the victim rolled down “three to five” steps to the foyer below.\n\nInvestigators later spotted Tucker on surveillance video leaving the arena on Causeway Street and tracked him to the area of Endicott Street and Lafayette Avenue, where he was taken into custody without incident.\n\nTucker was booked at the Nashua Street Jail and later released on bail.\n\nDownload the FREE Boston 25 News app for breaking news alerts.\n\nFollow Boston 25 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch Boston 25 News NOW",

    "description": "Apple’s AI Siri is planned for this year, and it'll use Google Gemini.",
    "fullText": "It's been nearly two years since Apple announced a more intelligent Siri, and yet, we're still waiting to get our hands on it. Aside from being able to answer a few questions about Apple products or shunt your questions off to ChatGPT for you, the voice assistant is essentially still the same it was before Apple Intelligence launched for other Apple features in iOS 18.1. Now, the iPhone maker seems to be throwing in the towel on developing an AI-enabled Siri entirely on its own, and is asking Google for help. I can't imagine Tim Cook is too happy about that, but on the flip side, that does mean an AI Siri might finally come out, and soon.\n\nIn a statement to CNBC's Jim Cramer, Apple admitted that it is now planning to use Google Gemini to power its AI-infused Siri, rather than purely in-house models. The company said that, \"After careful evaluation, we determined that Google's technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we're excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users.\"\n\nPreviously, Apple had promised that its AI Siri would be able to do tasks on your behalf, like send a drafted email, or would be able to answer questions using context pulled from your phone, like surfacing a friend's address using information pulled from a text thread. Reportedly, however, implementing these features during testing kept breaking more traditional Siri features, like setting alarms and reminders, which has kept sending Apple back to the drawing board. The new, Gemini-powered voice assistant for Android faced similar issues at first, but based on my hands-on time with the company's latest phones, those growing pains seem to have subsided, so it makes sense that Google would be the first company Apple would turn to while looking for outside help.\n\nApple hasn't said too much more about the deal for now, but Google itself did step in to offer Apple users a bit more clarity, plus some reassurance about their data.\n\nIn a statement on X, the company assured Apple users that \"Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple's industry-leading privacy standards.\" That's the same deal Apple has with OpenAI right now, which allows its users to ask ChatGPT questions without the AI being able to train on them or keep a log of their requests. It essentially means Google won't get any data from your AI-powered Siri. Google's statement also confirmed a detail from CNBC's initial article, stating that its agreement with Apple will be a multi-year deal.\n\nPerhaps most exciting is that Google said the AI-powered Siri will come out \"this year,\" mirroring a statement an Apple spokesperson gave to Daring Fireball last March, admitting that an AI-enabled Siri was taking longer than anticipated and saying the company hoped to launch it in 2026. That's welcome relief to anyone who thought Apple had given up on the project.\n\nA more concrete timeline is still unknown, although Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, a reputable reporter with inside sources at Apple, has previously said to expect the AI Siri upgrade to launch in the spring. Personally, I could also see the company holding the launch until its annual WWDC event, which tends to happen in June.\n\nDespite Apple and Google's public feud as the makers of iOS and Android, respectively, this wouldn't mark the two companies' first time working together, especially in the mobile space. Previously, it was uncovered that Google and Apple have a lucrative deal to make Google the default search engine in Safari, which caused a lengthy legal battle that ultimately allowed the companies to maintain their deal, but barred exclusivity contracts. Part of the reasoning behind the AI Siri delay might be that the companies wanted to work together on AI before, but were holding off on it out of an abundance of caution. However, according to the courts, Google will also be able to make deals with outside distributors for \"preloading and placement\" of its GenAI products going forward, which seemingly puts both companies in the clear.",

    "title": "The Out-of-Touch Adults' Guide to Kid Culture: Do You Have a 'Choppelganger'?",
    "description": "Teen trends, slang, and more, explained for you.",
    "fullText": "This weekly trip through the youth pop culture landscape takes us from turmoil in Stranger Things fandom, where many fans refuse to let the show end, to the kids' Wild West of Roblox, where age-verification is changing the landscape in a massive way, and all the way to Africa, where online mega-celebrity IShowSpeed is livestreaming a fascinating travelogue that people are watching all over the world.\n\nThe final episode of Netflix sci-fi series Stranger Things aired on Dec. 31 and it seems that many fans are not happy (shocking, right?). Some feel that the finale left too many loose ends, some that it all happened too easily, or that it was rushed, sloppy, and that it just kind of sucked. Some fans were so unhappy with the end of the series that they concluded it couldn't really be the end; there has to be more to it. Thus was born \"Conformity Gate,\" the fan-conspiracy-theory that states there is a secret, real ending to Stranger Things that Netflix hasn't released yet.\n\nIn a nutshell, Conformity Gate imagines that the events depicted in the last episode didn't actually happened in reality. The show's antagonist, Vecna, is in control of the story, and the seeming ending is an illusion that the characters (and audience) have been fed. The evidence is scant—props are slightly different from season to season or episode to episode, characters get small details wrong in dialogue, and other small differences. These are, I'm confident, the result of continuity and editing errors mixed with fans overanalyzing.\n\nI suspect the overarching issue with the end of Stranger Things is the same problem that has plagued other ambitious TV shows—Lost, Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, etc. There isn't a fully worked out ending when the show is pitched, leaving the show's creators to try to \"work something out\" for the ending, as opposed to going into it knowing exactly how it's going to come out. This is also why the first seasons of good shows are almost always better than the seasons that follow: The show's creators have fully plotted out the arc of the first season, but future events are more vague so the story feels slapdash instead of inevitable.\n\nAnyway, Charlie Heaton, who plays Jonathan Byers in Stranger Things, called the Conformity Gate theory \"insane,\" and the bio on Stranger Thing's X account was changed to read \"ALL EPISODES OF STRANGER THINGS ARE NOW PLAYING (all-caps are theirs.) This doesn't close the case on Stranger Things, though. There's still money to be made on the franchise, so I'd bet we see new content at some point; it just probably won't be a new ending.\n\nThe new year brings a world-shaking event to videogame Roblox: mandatory ID or facial verification. It works like this: if unverified users try to chat on Roblox, they are directed to give the game permissions to use their camera, then follow a series of online instructions so a verification algorithm can divine their age group based on their features. Users over 13 can submit a photo of an identification card instead. Roblox promises any images or videos taken during the verification process will be deleted after it is complete. Players who don't want to verify can still play Roblox, but they won't be able to use communication features within it. Once Roblox knows users' ages, it only allows them to chat with others in similar age groups. Here's how the company breaks down who may chat with whom:\n\nThe move is in response to longtime concerns about child safety within Roblox, which include organized groups of online predators like 764 using the game to recruit victims, Roblox mini-games with questionable content that are/were open to younger players, and at least 24 reported arrests of sex predators using Roblox to find victims.\n\nAn age-verified Roblox account is a positive step, but it's far from perfect. Videos like this are popping up on TikTok, where users seem to be sharing ways to get around the filter system. I have no idea if this would work, but if it does, not only would it let kids have more \"grown up\" accounts, it also could lead to grown-ups getting \"younger\" accounts. Online groomers often mimic the age group they're interested in, and a verified account seems like it would make this much easier. Another area of concern: Last week, users on X were linking to eBay accounts specifically advertised as \"13-15 age group accounts.\" Those auctions seem to have been taken down by eBay, but in the darker corners of the internet, I have no doubt that trade in verified Roblox accounts is brisk.\n\nThis week's slang word combines the words \"chopped\" and \"doppelgänger\" to deliver a massive insult. \"Chopped\" (as you can read in Lifehacker's glossary of Gen Z and Gen A slang) describes a person who is ugly, and doppelgänger means \"a ghostly duplicate of a living person,\" so a choppelganger is someone who looks like you, but worse. The term was coined in this post on X :\n\nAnd it was soon adopted by TikTokers who posted videos like these:\n\nIt's probably not the most widely used slang—there aren't too many places where the idea actually would come up—but it's definitely clever.\n\nThese are dark days for humanity, but there's some sunlight breaking through. This week's conformation of the essential goodness of people comes from YouTube legend IShowSpeed, who is in the middle of posting an epic series of livestream videos documenting a trip to Africa. The internet is responding, both in America and in Africa, with tens of millions of views.\n\nSo far, Speed has visited Rwanda, Zambia, Kenya (where he and his crew went on safari and visited the Maasai Mara where Speed got a traditional tattoo, among other adventures) and more. Many more stops are planned in the coming days, including Liberia, Morocco, and Botswana. Speed is like an informal ambassador for America's people, and his open, honest, hilarious videos are acting as a cultural exchange program or a bridge between two worlds. The comments are amazing, with African people posting things like, \"No words can capture the depth of what we feel as Africans. By simply revealing our humanity, you have compelled the world to witness the true brilliance of our continent—its beauty, its dignity, its spirit,\" and Americans saying things like, \"I didn’t know Zimbabwe was lit like that\" and posting emotional reaction videos like this:\n\nIf you need some hopium, you should definitely go to IShowSpeed's YouTube channel and follow along on his adventures, even if you're an old fart like me.",

    "title": "Microsoft Is Finally Working on a Worthy Answer to Apple's 'Handoff' Feature",
    "description": "Start using an app on your Android, then continue where you left off on your PC.",
    "fullText": "Love it or hate it, the Apple ecosystem really does have its perks. Take \"Handoff,\" for example. With this feature, you can be working in one app on one of your devices, then continue on in the same app on one of your other devices. You can start an article in Safari on your iPhone, then finish it on your Mac, without needing to google the piece and scroll to find your spot. It isn't 100%, but when it works, it's pretty great.\n\nMicrosoft actually offers a similar feature over on Windows, though it's so limited, you might not even know it exists. The feature is called Resume, and the idea is to allow you to pick up your place in an app from another device on your PC. For the most part, that means Android apps; so if you have a PC and an Android phone, Resume could offer the same benefits as someone with a Mac and an iPhone. However, so few apps actually work with Resume, that it's effectively useless.\n\nAs spotted by Windows Latest, Microsoft is making some serious updates to Resume. The company recently updated the Resume support document, which confirms Microsoft is opening the feature up to more Android apps.\n\nThe support document doesn't specify what apps might be coming, but it doesn't necessarily have to for this news to be exciting; rather, the development alone implies that many more Android apps will likely be on the way—assuming their developers simply get on board.\n\nAs Windows Latest explains, the reason Resume has been so limited is due to how restrictive Microsoft's API is. The only apps that can currently tap into Resume are ones that have access to the \"Link to Windows\" API. Many Android developers either don't know how to develop with this API, or simply can't, since their apps are not compatible.\n\nThe latest update to Resume offers developers another option, however: Now, developers can use Windows Notification System (WNS), a built-in API that is far more common and supports far more apps. That said, developers can't just update their apps with the WNS and expect to be compatible with Resume. Microsoft tells Windows Latest that developers need to reach out to Microsoft directly for approval. That application needs to include the developer's WNS registration, the app's Package SID, a summary of what the app does, and screenshots of the app in action.\n\nIt's basically like signing up for TSA PreCheck: Most of us who apply will likely get approved, but they don't just let anyone decide to join. You need to provide proof you qualify and submit for screening before you get there. That will likely end up working well for anyone who's interested in using Resume: The apps that will be available will all be vetted by Microsoft, so there should only be legitimate and useful apps offering that linking capability.\n\nThese changes probably won't roll out for some time on Windows. However, you can set yourself up for success now by turning the feature on. To start, head to Settings > Apps, then scroll until you find \"Resume.\" Here, turn on the feature. Right now, you'll probably see the only app that is compatible is OneDrive. You can connect it if you wish, which will let you work on a document across both your Android device and your PC.",

    "description": "Microsoft is officially retiring Microsoft Lens, unless it decides to delay again.",
    "fullText": "Nothing lasts forever. Devices lose support, standards are replaced, and software becomes obsolete. So it is with Microsoft Lens, whose days are numbered. Keen observers have known about this since August, when Microsoft first announced that Lens would be retired in September and removed from app stores in November. That obviously didn't happen, as the company adjusted the deadline to Dec. 15, which also came and went. Microsoft kicked the retirement can down the road—that is, until now.\n\nMicrosoft Lens was Microsoft's solution for anyone in the mid-2010s who didn't own a scanner. Rather than buy an expensive piece of hardware to digitize documents, Lens allowed people to use their smartphone camera to turn those hard copies into digital files. It was hardly the only document scanner available on app stores (Apple's Notes app has had the function built in since iOS 11), but because it was made by Microsoft, it was a good solution for getting files into Microsoft apps like Word, PowerPoint, or Excel. It's also free and compatible with both Android and iOS, making the app universally accessible. We even listed it first in our roundup of the best document scanner apps from 2021.\n\nAccording to the app's support document, Microsoft Lens officially began retirement proceedings on Jan. 9. That doesn't mean the app is dead, though: Microsoft will still support it until Feb. 9. After that, the app will receive no updates, and Microsoft will remove it from app stores. (If you're passionate or curious about Microsoft Lens, make sure to install it before then.) No matter what, however, you'll only have another month to use it. As of March 9, you will no longer be able to create new scans in Lens, but you'll still be able to view your previous scans as long as the app remains on your device.\n\nOnce we settle into mid-March, Microsoft Lens users will need to choose an alternative scanning app. Fortunately, there are plenty of options on app stores to choose from. In fact, you might not need to download anything new at all: As mentioned above, iPhone users can tap into the Notes app's built-in scanner, while Google Drive users can do the same.\n\nMicrosoft, of course, wants you to stay within the ecosystem, so they'd prefer you use OneDrive's built-in scanner. If you already have that app on your phone, it might be as good an option as any. However, there are popular, dedicated apps, like Genius Scan, Adobe Scan, and Photomyne, that offer additional features not available in built-in scanners.",

When a pitch isn't playable, it's unfortunate but the game can't go ahead.\n\n\"Duke Rugby Club did everything they could to have the game go ahead, we were there ready to play along with the Cheetahs, but in conjunction with our team and their team, the referee took what we feel was the correct decision to cancel.\"",

Hellerstein had initially approved Fein’s application to join Maduro’s drug trafficking case but reversed course after the deposed leader’s actual lawyer, Barry Pollack, objected to his involvement.\n\nFein, an associate deputy attorney general during Ronald Reagan’s presidency, claimed in court papers that “individuals credibly situated” within Maduro’s inner circle or family had sought out his assistance. Fein claimed that Maduro “had expressed a desire” for his “assistance in this matter.”\n\nBut Hellerstein said in a written order that only Maduro has the authority to retain Fein as his lawyer, not unidentified individuals. He rejected Fein's request for the judge to summon Maduro to court to ask him if he would like Fein added to the defense team.\n\n“If Maduro wishes to retain Fein, he has the ability to do so,\" Hellerstein wrote. \"Fein cannot appoint himself to represent Maduro.\"\n\nMessages seeking comment were left Monday for Fein and Pollack.\n\nPollack, a prominent Washington lawyer whose clients have included WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, was the only lawyer with Maduro at his Jan. 5 arraignment in Manhattan federal court, days after U.S. special forces seized Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, from their home in Caracas.\n\nIn court, Maduro called it a kidnapping and declared himself a prisoner of war. Pollack told Hellerstein he expected to make “substantial” court filings challenging the legality of his military abduction\" and invoking immunity as the head of a sovereign state.\n\nAs Fein sought to join the case, Pollack said in a court filing last week that he'd spoken with Maduro and that the ex-leader confirmed to him that he doesn't know Fein and has not communicated with him, much less retained him or authorized him to join the case.\n\nFein acknowledged in a written response that he'd had no contact with Maduro by telephone, video or any other direct way.\n\nMaduro and Flores have pleaded not guilty to charges alleging he worked with drug cartels to facilitate the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the U.S. They remain held without bail at a federal jail in Brooklyn and are due back in court on March 17.",

The balls are hugging the rail. The top slates need levelling up. The table fitters need to go out and check the level of the top slate.\n\n\"If those balls are hugging that top rail, then it's going to make the game incredibly easy to make big breaks. It's also wrong that a ball should go in that easily. This looks like it's not level.\"\n\nIn response, the organisers of the invitation-only Masters, which typically features only the top-16 ranked players in the world, said: \"The table is checked before, during and after every match, as is standard at any event.\n\n\"We strive to provide the best possible playing conditions and our team of expert table fitters do a fantastic job.\"",

Parts of New England may still have lingering snow on Friday.\n\n\"Plowable snow accumulations are most likely across the interior of the Northeast. Higher elevations of the Appalachians and across northern New England will also be more likely to have several inches of snow late in the week,\" said AccuWeather Meteorologist Brandon Buckingham.\n\nSome of the highest snow totals are predicted downwind of the Great Lakes, added Buckingham.\n\nInches of snow piling up across the interior Northeast can lead to slippery travel as early as Wednesday evening and continue into Thursday night.\n\nPlaces like Pittsburgh and Buffalo, New York, could have slippery Wednesday afternoon and evening commutes, while some of the heaviest snow will fall in central and eastern New York on Wednesday night.\n\nGET THE FREE ACCUWEATHER APP\n•Have the app?

Wind gusts to around 40 mph will be possible across the Northeast and New England Thursday and Thursday night, adding further to any visibility concerns.\n\nWill it snow along the Interstate 95 corridor?\n\nGiven the storm track, it seems unlikely that several inches of snow will accumulate in cities like Philadelphia and New York City. However, it's not out of the question that flakes would fly in these cities.\n\nA burst of snow is possible late on Thursday in New York City, which could bring slippery spots and reduced visibility in time for travelers. Some of the far northern and western suburbs could get a coating to an inch of snow.\n\nEven without a blockbuster snowstorm for the Interstate 95 cities, there could still be impacts to travel across the region. \"With cold infiltrating the Northeast Thursday night, it would be easy for untreated surfaces, even wet surfaces, to freeze up and bring slippery spots for the Friday morning commute,\" Buckingham added.\n\nAreas across New England, such as eastern Massachusetts and Down East Maine, will be more susceptible to higher snowfall totals, with the potential for the storm to linger into Friday for these regions. A slippery coating to an inch is forecast for Boston.\n\nCold and snow chances are likely to continue following this storm.\n\nPersistent cold air and an active storm track is expected to bring additional rounds of snow for the Great Lakes and the Northeast, as soon as this weekend but even through next week.\n\nSnow lovers and skiers dismayed by the recent thaw will at least have something to be happy about with the return of persistent cold air.\n\nResorts will be able to make new snow to rebuild their base, and lake-effect snow showers may coat the landscape again in some areas.\n\nWant next-level safety, ad-free?

It would be a complete mess, and almost impossible for our Country to pay. Anybody who says that it can be quickly and easily done would be making a false, inaccurate, or totally misunderstood answer to this very large and complex question. It may not be possible but, if it were, it would be Dollars that would be so large that it would take many years to figure out what number we are talking about and even, who, when, and where, to pay,” he continued. “Remember, when America shines brightly, the World shines brightly. In other words, if the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE’RE SCREWED!”\n\nThe Court’s ruling on the matter is expected to be released in the near future, and possibly even this Wednesday.\n\nAfter the Department of Commerce released figures last month indicating that the economy had grown at an impressive annualized rate of 4.3% between last July and September, Trump credited his trade policy.\n\n“The TARIFFS are responsible for the GREAT USA Economic Numbers JUST ANNOUNCED…AND THEY WILL ONLY GET BETTER!” he argued at the time. “Also, NO INFLATION & GREAT NATIONAL SECURITY. Pray for the U.S. Supreme Court!!!”\n\nThe Court heard the case, which challenges Trump’s authority to levy the import taxes without congressional action, in November. During oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts characterized the tariffs as “taxes on Americans” in a moment that some court-watchers believed portended poorly for the administration.\n\nThe post ‘WE’RE SCREWED’: Trump Issues Grave Warning About Supreme Court Striking Down Tariff ‘Bonanza’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "It was one of those moments that Dominik Szoboszlai will never, ever want to watch again.\n\nIn the same half in which the 25-year-old scored a belter that arguably no keeper would have saved, the Liverpool midfielder made a mistake that was described as \"disrespectful\" by Barnsley manager Conor Hourihane and \"weird\" by his own boss, Arne Slot.\n\nAfter sprinting and winning the ball ahead of Adam Phillips, Szoboszlai tried to backheel the ball in his own box to Liverpool keeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, but scuffed the ball and left Phillips with a tap-in.\n\nIt proved inconsequential in the end but was the main talking point post-match.\n\n\"I don't think you should do that in an FA Cup or League Cup game, a friendly game or even a training session,\" said Slot. \"It's a weird choice and I have my opinion about it but I prefer to keep that to myself and speak about that with Dom.\"\n\nFor Hourihane, there was a sense of anger with the fact that Szoboszlai tried to backheel the ball in the first place.\n\n\"I was disappointed with our goal because he [Szoboszlai] doesn't do that against Chelsea or Arsenal,\" Hourihane told TNT Sports.\n\nAsked if it was disrespectful, Hourihane added: \"Yeah, potentially. I don't think he does that in a Premier League game or in a Champions League game so I was a little bit disappointed with that. It was a bit of a lack of respect.\n\n\"Delighted for Adam, but disrespectful from their player's point of view.\"\n\nAside from the error, Szoboszlai's performance was impressive as he became the first Premier League player this season to score a goal, complete 100+ passes (105) and win possession 10+ times (12) in a single match.\n\n\"I'm sorry for the team again. I made it hard for us with an easy mistake I would say. But football moves on and we take the next round,\" he said.\n\nEx-Crystal Palace and Reading winger Jobi McAnuff told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"The first half was almost too easy for Liverpool at times. Yes Barnsley had a couple of opportunities and didn't take them prior to their goal and as an opponent you get yourself into a mindset of doing things you wouldn't normally do.\n\n\"The game was safe at that point and it's just one of those horrendous situations. It looks worse the more you watch it back. Whatever he's done, he's got it all wrong.\"\n\nOn TNT Sports, former Manchester City defender Joleon Lescott agreed the error was \"disrespectful\", while ex-Scotland striker Ally McCoist described it as \"incredible\".",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had “a very good conversation” with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday and that their two governments will continue working together on security issues without the need for U.S. intervention against drug cartels.\n\nThe approximately 15-minute call came after Sheinbaum said Friday she had requested dialogue with the Trump administration at the end of a week in which he had said he was ready to confront drug cartels on the ground and repeated the accusation that cartels were running Mexico.\n\nTrump has repeatedly offered to send the U.S. military after the cartels and Sheinbaum has always declined, but after the U.S. removal of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, Trump’s comments about Mexico, Cuba and Greenland carried new weight.\n\n“He (Trump) asked me my opinion about what they had done in Venezuela and I told him very clearly that our constitution is very clear, that we do not agree with interventions and that was it,” Sheinbaum said.\n\nTrump “still insisted that if we ask for it, they could help” with military forces, which Sheinbaum said she again rejected. “We told him, so far it’s going very well, it’s not necessary, and furthermore there is Mexico’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and he understood.”\n\nIn an interview with Fox News aired last Thursday, Trump said, “We’ve knocked out 97% of the drugs coming in by water and we are going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels. The cartels are running Mexico. It’s very sad to watch.”\n\nSheinbaum said Monday the two leaders agreed to continue working together.\n\nMexico’s Foreign Affairs Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente spoke Sunday with his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Rubio asked for “tangible results” and more cooperation to dismantle the cartels, according to a statement from the U.S. State Department.\n\nSheinbaum said Mexico shared those results, including a significant drop in homicides, falling U.S. fentanyl seizures and fentanyl overdose deaths.\n\nExperts still see U.S. intervention in Mexico as unlikely because Mexico is doing what the U.S. asks and is a critical economic partner, but expect Trump to continue using such rhetoric to maintain pressure on Mexico to do more.\n\nSheinbaum said the two leaders did not speak about Cuba, which Trump threatened Sunday. Mexico is an important ally of the island nation, including selling it oil that it will need even more desperately now that the Trump administration says it will not allow any more oil shipments from Venezuela to Cuba.",

    "description": "Security camera video has been released in the Marcus Freeman case. Watch it here.",
    "fullText": "This story has been altered to add new information.\n\nThe Mishawaka Police Department released the surveillance video of the alleged incident between Notre Dame football head coach Marcus Freeman and New Prairie High School assistant wrestling coach Chris Fleeger.\n\nIn the video, released Monday, Jan. 11, Freeman is standing in the top-left corner of the screen, wearing a navy blue jacket, gray hoodie with the hood up, watching his son, Vinny, compete in the Al Smith Wrestling Invitational at Mishawaka High School. The match ends and the wrestlers go through their customary post-match handshakes with themselves and opposing coaches.\n\nOriginal story: Notre Dame says accusations against Marcus Freeman 'unfounded'\n\nIt's at that point, around 45 seconds into the video, where Fleeger appears to come over and start interacting with the Freeman's and Penn head coach Brad Harper. As the Penn contingent goes to leave, Fleeger appears to follow them, leading to a confrontation near the doorway.\n\nThe talking goes for several seconds before it appears to continue in the hallway. It's hard to tell from that point what happens.\n\nFleeger filed a police report against Freeman, claiming he made physical contact with him. The Mishawaka Police Department investigated the case and found no evidence of this claim. Police turned the final investigative report over to the St. Joseph County prosecutor, who issued a news release Jan. 11 declining to press any criminal battery charges against Freeman.\n\n\"While the video of the incident is from a distance, officers were able to identify Mr. Freeman and the Complainant,\" the prosecutor's statement read. \"In the video, officers were able to observe Mr. Freeman moving to leave a crowded gym with his son. The exit doors were partially blocked by other people. As Mr. Freeman walked toward the doors, the video shows the Complainant moving from his position near the doors and approach Mr. Freeman. Mr. Freeman turned toward the Complainant and paused for approximately one second. Mr. Freeman then left the auditorium at a walk.\n\n\"The video shows that while Mr. Freeman’s right arm is not fully visible, his left hand remained in a pocket during the interaction between the Complainant and Mr. Freeman. The head and body movements of both the Complainant and Mr. Freeman do not support the supposition that any violent physical contact occurred.\"\n\nPer the release, \"the video does not support the claim that Mr. Freeman gave the Complainant a 'two handed push' nor that the Complainant stumbled backwards after the incident as originally alleged by the Complainant and his acquaintances.\"\n\nIn the prosecutor's release, it's noted that Fleeger tried to recruit Vinny Freeman to be part of his club team in New Carlisle and wrestle for New Prairie High School, an offer the Freeman family declined.\n\nA witness was quoted in the prosecutor's release that Fleeger has voiced his anger at the Freeman family in the past, even telling other wrestlers to try to purposefully injure Vinny. Fleeger denied those claims in the report.\n\nAustin Hough is a sports editor within the Center for Community Journalism at USA Today Co., overseeing high school sports and Notre Dame athletics coverage for five Indiana newspapers.

    "description": "Google cofounder Sergey Brin studied graduate computer science at Stanford—but admits Gen Z no longer needs a degree to land a high-paying job at the tech giant.",
    "fullText": "Whether it’s Nike’s Phil Knight, LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, or Google’s Sergey Brin, many of the world’s most influential business founders can trace part of their success back to Stanford University. Nestled in the foothills of Silicon Valley, the school has long functioned as a launchpad for tech’s elite.\n\nBut the rise of artificial intelligence is challenging long-held assumptions about the value of higher education. As tech reshapes entry-level work and companies rethink traditional hiring pipelines, the payoff of a four-year degree—especially from elite institutions—is increasingly up for debate.\n\nStill, Brin doesn’t regret his own academic path. Speaking to Stanford engineering students last month, he said his decision to study computer science was not driven by a fixation on credentials.\n\n“I chose computer science because I had a passion for it,” he said. “It was kind of a no-brainer for me. I guess you could say I was also lucky because I was also in such a transformative field.”\n\nEven in an era when AI can write code, Brin cautioned students against chasing—or abandoning—fields of study based solely on automation fears.\n\n“I wouldn’t go off and switch to comparative literature because you think the AI is good at coding,” he said. “The AI is probably even better at comparative literature, just to be perfectly honest anyway.”\n\nBrin met Google cofounder Larry Page in 1994 during his second year of graduate studies at Stanford. Together they developed PageRank, an algorithm they later renamed Google and would become a company in 1998.\n\nGoogle’s hiring practices today reflect how dramatically the industry has shifted. The tech giant is now embracing workers without college degrees.\n\n“In as much as we’ve hired a lot of academic stars, we’ve hired tons of people who don’t have bachelor’s degrees,” Brin said. “They just figure things out on their own in some weird corner.”\n\nBetween 2017 and 2022, the share of job postings at Google requiring a degree dropped from 93% to 77%, according to analysis from the Burning Glass Institute. And Google isn’t alone: companies including Microsoft, Apple, and Cisco have reduced degree requirements in recent years, signaling a broader industry shift toward skills-based hiring.\n\nThat’s forcing a broader reckoning over what a degree actually signals and whether it’s still a reliable proxy for talent.\n\n“I don’t think necessarily because you go to an Ivy League school or have great grades it means you’re going to be a great worker or great person,” said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in 2024. For many roles, skills matter far more than credentials, he added: “If you look at skills of people, it is amazing how skilled people are in something, but it didn’t show up in their resume.”",

    "fullText": "Authorities in Westminster, a suburb in Orange County, are looking to spread awareness of vandalism at the Westminster Mall, which closed last October but has since become a hotbed of illicit activity.\n\nAccording to the Westminster Police Department, the mall has been boarded up since its closure; however, people still are finding ways to enter. One look inside shows that trespassers have trashed the mall, smashing glass storefronts, throwing leftover merchandise around and spray painting much of the interior.\n\nWestminster police say that, since the mall shut down, their department has received 402 calls for service for various crimes, including vandalism and trespassing. Individuals with arrest warrants have also been apprehended there, per WPD.\n\nA witness told KTLA that this weekend, they saw around 60 people in the mall at once — with no police or security in sight. They submitted pictures and video of the damaged mall but insisted they were “only there for footage” and did not participate in the vandalism.\n\nJust this past weekend, at least 30 people were arrested for vandalism, a Westminster Police Department spokesperson confirmed to KTLA. The spokesperson added that investigators believe the recent uptick in incidents may have to do with videos circulating online that show the vandalized interior.\n\nHowever, those videos are not an invitation to enter the mall, the spokesperson stated.\n\n“This has become a safety issue,” they said. “Anyone trespassing will get arrested.”",

    "fullText": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) pulled no punches on Monday in roasting her former fellow Senate Democrat, Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ). Warren spoke at the National Press Club and accused Sinema of “cashing in from the industry she protected.”\n\n“Many voters are rightly skeptical that we’ll really make something happen,” Warren said, referring to party policy on fixing the affordability crisis.\n\n“After all, we didn’t even take the extraordinarily obvious and simple step of increasing the minimum wage the last time we had power. Ask Kyrsten Sinema, the former Democratic senator from Arizona, who curtsied on the Senate floor while rejecting a minimum wage increase in 2021 to raise wages for up to 27 million Americans, and then spent the rest of her time in office protecting hedge fund managers from paying taxes and blocking filibuster reform,” Warren said, adding:\n\nSinema faced no consequences from her president or her leaders in Washington. Eventually, it was her own constituents back home who chased her out of the Senate. But today, she is cashing in from the industry she protected. The Wall Street Journal recently marveled at the sheer number of projects Sinema has taken on from crypto, AI, and other wealthy corporate clients. And meanwhile, millions of working Americans who have not seen a minimum wage increase in almost two decades are still waiting for Democrats to deliver on one of our most basic promises.\n\nSinema sparked fury on the left during her time in office for skuttling some of the Democrats’ top policy agenda items during President Joe Biden’s term, including closing the “carried interest” loophole that benefits hedge fund managers and stopping an increase in corporate taxes.\n\nWatch the clip above via C-SPAN.\n\nThe post Elizabeth Warren Accuses Former Democratic Colleague of Blatant Corruption: ‘She Is Cashing In’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "Jan 12 (Reuters) - Apple will use Google's Gemini models for its revamped Siri coming later this year under a multi-year deal that deepens the tech giants' alliance in the ​artificial intelligence era and bolsters Alphabet's position in the race against OpenAI.\n\nThe deal announced Monday marks a major ‌vote of confidence for Google. Its technology already drives much of Samsung's \"Galaxy AI,\" but the Siri deal unlocks a large market with Apple's installed base ‌of more than two billion active devices.\n\n\"After careful evaluation, Apple determined Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models,\" Google said, adding that its models will also power other future Apple Intelligence features.\n\nAlphabet has been jostling with OpenAI for the Apple deal, the financial details of which were not disclosed.\n\nThe iPhone maker had in late 2024 rolled out ChatGPT into its ⁠devices, allowing the company's Siri voice assistant ‌to tap into the chatbot's expertise to answer complicated questions.\n\nApple said there were no major changes to the ChatGPT integration at the time, while OpenAI did not respond to Reuters' request for ‍comment.\n\n\"This seems like an unreasonable concentration of power for Google, given that (they) also have Android and Chrome,\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a post on social media platform X.\n\nMusk founded his own AI firm xAI that has been trying to compete with other major players ​in the industry by building foundational models and spending billions on massive infrastructure.\n\nMonday's tie-up will likely raise questions on OpenAI's ‌partnership with Apple. In response to Gemini 3, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman late last year reportedly issued a \"code red\" to push teams to accelerate development.\n\n\"Apple's decision to use Google's Gemini models for Siri shifts OpenAI into a more supporting role, with ChatGPT remaining positioned for complex, opt-in queries rather than the default intelligence layer,\" said Parth Talsania, CEO of Equisights Research.\n\nGoogle has been firing on all cylinders to counter OpenAI's early lead in the industry by doubling down on frontier models, and ⁠image and video generation.\n\nApple has faced a series of setbacks on the ​AI front after being late to the race, with Siri's upgrade getting ​delayed, top-level executive changes and the initial rollout of its generative AI tools being met with lukewarm reception.\n\nThe latest agreement builds on a years-long partnership that makes Google the default search engine on ‍Apple devices - a lucrative arrangement that ⁠drives traffic for Google while generating tens of billions in annual revenue for Apple.",

    "fullText": "The cable news ratings for 2025 are in, and it was another strong year for Fox News, which posted gains in total viewers across primetime and total day compared to 2024.\n\nOn the other end, CNN and the newly branded MS NOW (formerly MSNBC) both saw declines compared to last year, falling by double-digits in total viewers and the key Adults 25-54 demo in primetime and total day.\n\nFox News also experienced declines in the key 25-54 demo, though not to the extent of its rival networks, posting single-digit drops.\n\nAccording to AdWeek, citing Nielsen big data + panel for 2025, Fox News averaged 2.652 million total viewers (up 11 per cent on last year) during primetime. In the demo, the network averaged 278,000 viewers, down five percent year-over-year.\n\nIt should be noted that Nielsen changed its rating methodology last year, so the way numbers are measured compared to 2024 could be skewed.\n\nIn total day, Fox News averaged 1.691 million total viewers (up 16 per cent compared to 2024) and 180,000 in the key demo (down 3 per cent).\n\nFox News topped the charts for total primetime viewers across all cable networks and placed third in the demo. It also held the top spot for total viewers across total day and ranked second in the demo.\n\nMS NOW (MSNBC until November 2025) averaged 915,000 total viewers (down 15 per cent on 2024) and 80,000 demo viewers (down 40 per cent on last year) in primetime. During total day, MS NOW averaged 551,000 total viewers (down 30 per cent) and 48,000 demo viewers (down 43 per cent).\n\nOverall, MS NOW ranked third in total primetime viewers across all basic cable networks and dropped from ninth to 19th in the demo. In total day, the network dropped from No. 3 to No. 2 in total viewers and from eighth to 13th in the demo.\n\nMeanwhile, CNN averaged 573,000 total viewers (down 16 per cent) and 102,000 demo viewers (down 31 per cent) in primetime. Across total day, it had 432,000 total viewers (down 10 per cent) and 70,000 demo viewers (down 23 per cent).\n\nCNN ranked seventh among total viewers across all basic cable networks for 2025 and tenth (down from sixth) in the demo. For total day, the network remained in fourth place for total viewers and dropped from sixth to seventh in the demo chart.\n\nAs for programming, Fox News made up 14 of the 15 spots of the most-watched cable shows of the year. The Five took the top spot with 4.046 million viewers and 377,000 demo viewers.\n\nThe only non-Fox News show in the Top 15 was MS NOW’s The Rachel Maddow Show, which placed at No. 13 with 1.864 million viewers and No. 14 in the demo chart with 172,000 viewers.\n\nRead the latest entertainment news on TV Insider.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - New York City nurses walked out of 10 major private hospitals across the city on Monday ​to demand increased staffing, funding of health benefits and protection from workplace violence ‌often coming from patients.\n\nMayor Zohran Mamdani, who is just two weeks into his term, joined the picket lines to ‌support 15,000 nurses that the New York State Nurses Association said were on strike.\n\n\"They are not asking for a multi-million dollar salary. What they are asking is for their pensions to be safeguarded, to be protected in their own workplace, to receive the pay and the health benefits ⁠that they deserve,\" Mamdani told ‌reporters.\n\nMount Sinai said that the union's proposals would cost it $1.6 billion over three years, with a $638 million increase in nursing costs by the third ‍year, which is 74% more than current costs.\n\nNew York State Gov. Kathy Hochul had declared a disaster emergency last week, allowing out-of-state and foreign medical personnel to cover for striking staff. The disaster emergency ​is in effect until February 8.\n\nOn Monday morning, dozens of nurses spoke of lack of ‌healthcare benefits and inability to take adequate breaks during their shifts as they rallied outside a NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in uptown Manhattan. NewYork-Presbyterian is one of three healthcare networks affected by the strike along with Mount Sinai and Montefiore.\n\n\"In the operating room, I work as a night nurse and we're always short on staffing and this is unsafe for the patient,\" said Michael ⁠Lazar, a 53-year-old NewYork-Presbyterian nurse.\n\nMount Sinai said it ​had secured more than 1,000 qualified and specialized agency ​nurses to cover for striking medics and to deliver care for \"however long a strike may last.\"\n\nNewYork-Presbyterian said all of its hospitals were open and continued ‍to provide services.\n\nMontefiore did ⁠not immediately respond to a request for comment. A notice on its website said that services would not be impacted by the strike.\n\nThe union and the hospitals held ⁠the last round of the negotiations the day before the strike, according to Mount Sinai and NYSNA. As ‌of Monday evening, there was no information about the next talks.",
