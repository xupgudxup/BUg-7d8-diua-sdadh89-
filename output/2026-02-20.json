    "fullText": "Brentford seek to edge closer to a first-every appearance in Europe against a Brighton side with no wins in 13 matches at the Gtech Community Stadium.\n\nThe Bees have performed extremely well this season and occupy seventh place in the Premier League, which is not a position they would’ve expected to be in having promoted Keith Andrews to Thomas Frank’s old hotseat.\n\nAndrews has stepped into the role as Brentford boss and has ticked all the boxes, with his side going toe-to-toe with league leaders Arsenal in their last top-flight match and claiming a point at home.\n\nFor Brentford, Kevin Schade is available after serving his three-match ban for seeing red against Aston Villa earlier in the month.\n\nMinutes were managed for Igor Thiago, Jordan Henderson, Mikkel Damsgaard and Caoimhín Kelleher, who were all absent from the FA Cup squad which beat Macclesfield, so they are likely to return to the fold tomorrow.\n\nBut Joshua DaSilva, Fábio Carvalho and Antoni Milambo all remain out through knee injuries.\n\nThe Seagulls are navigating a very difficult period compared to their opponents at the weekend, with the last league win for Fabian Hürzeler’s side – now likely a distant memory to Brighton fans – came against relegation-threatened Burnley at the beginning of January.\n\nSitting in 14th place, Brighton are just seven points above the relegation zone and are in need of wins soon in order to avoid being dragged into the relegation scrap.\n\nIn the reverse fixture, Brentford suffered a narrow 2-1 defeat with a penalty converted early by Igor Thiago but conceded goals from Danny Welbeck and Jack Hinshelwood in the second half.\n\nThe Gtech Community Stadium has been a formidable ground this season, with a minimal two defeats in West London; only Arsenal, Man City and Sunderland have fewer, with one.\n\nPositive injury news arrived for Hürzeler, as Solly March has a good chance of featuring after being present in full training and gaining match-sharpness with the U21s.\n\nThe Englishman last played a competitive match in September 2024 and will be eager to get back on the pitch after a long stint out.\n\nAlthough Yasin Ayari is not available for the upcoming trip to West London, he is close to returning to the squad, but Stefanos Tzimas and Adam Webster are both out long-term.\n\nThe match kicks off on Saturday the 21st February (15:00 GMT).",

    "fullText": "Proposed Twins signing sees Minnesota acquire $61 million All-Star, former Cy Young candidate ace as insurance for Pablo Lopez originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Minnesota Twins have really been quiet this offseason, after making it seem like they were blowing up at last season’s trade deadline. However, they’ve made no moves, and still have something resembling a contender on their hands.\n\nWith that in mind, they need to capitalize if they don’t rebuild, and the first thing they need to do is find a temporary replacement and insurance for their injured No. 2 pitcher, Pablo Lopez. Fansided’s Robert Murray believes the Twins should target former All-Star Lucas Giolito as their answer.\n\nMORE: Proposed Phillies trade sees Philadelphia deal Edmundo Sosa, Orion Kerkering to solve two major roster issues\n\n“The Twins are not the first team you’d imagine when thinking about Giolito, but they were on Framber Valdez and have shown interest in fortifying their rotation this offseason. Giolito could be a short-term solution that they trade at the deadline for prospects, something that a rebuilding team should strongly consider. He’d also be tremendous insurance for Pablo Lopez, who is out with an elbow injury that is being further evaluated” Kline wrote.\n\nGiolito finished 2025 with a 10-4 record, a 3.41 ERA, 121 Ks, and a WHIP of 1.290 over 145 innings pitched. He would definitely be a top three arm in their rotation, and gives the Twins a nice 1-2-3 punch.\n\nMORE: Braves predicted to be forced into signing $61 million All-Star, former Cy Young candidate after latest Hurston Waldrep injury update\n\nAnd, while he’s projected to receive a three-year, $61 million deal, the fact that his market hasn’t heated up at all with Opening Day almost here, means the Twins could get him on a bargain.\n\nHopefully, they do and have a solid rotation for this upcoming season.\n\nMets predicted to cut ties with $2.5 million World Series champion, nine-time All-Star closer to make room in Devin Williams-led bullpen\n\nProposed Reds trade sees Cincinnati land $100 million two-time All-Star, Platinum Glove after missing out on Kyle Schwarber\n\nProposed Mets blockbuster trade sees New York land $100 million two-time All-Star, Platinum Glove to replace Pete Alonso",

    "fullText": "Reports from Germany suggest Liverpool and Arsenal are both keeping tabs on Bayern Munich youngster Lennart Karl.\n\nOne of the more noticeable shifts in Liverpool’s recruitment strategy has been a stronger emphasis on signing younger players with long-term upside. January saw them make a £60m move for 20-year-old Jeremy Doku, while also adding more teenagers to their youth set-up.\n\nKarl’s agent, Kevin Räber, was asked about potential interest in the 18-year-old midfielder during an interview with Sky Germany, but he chose to remain tight-lipped.\n\nThe report says that “many clubs” are looking at the teenager right now. But another name mentioned is Arsenal, who have already made one major addition from Bayern’s ranks by signing Joshua Kimmich this summer.\n\nGraeme Bailey from TeamTalk reports that both clubs are keeping a close eye on the young midfielder.\n\nKarl is contracted to Bayern until 2028, giving the German club some leverage in any future negotiations. Both clubs are said to be monitoring his progress closely.\n\nWhile Real Madrid, Barcelona, and PSG are also reported to be interested in Karl, it’s the English sides—Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City—who are reportedly tracking him most closely at this stage.\n\nBayern aren’t sitting idle either. They’re currently in talks with Karl over a new four-year contract extension, which could complicate any potential move.\n\nMuller praised Karl’s technical abilities late last year:\n\n”His shooting technique is certainly exceptional. He has very good finishing,” Muller said. “And that’s already an excellent asset to have because if you play in attack for FC Bayern and you’re energetic and agile, you’ll constantly find yourself in scoring positions.”\n\nWhy Philippe Coutinho asked to leave Vasco and what comes next for the ex-Liverpool man\n\nMichael Carrick on Man Utd’s 22-day gap: ‘There’s no black and white answer’\n\nBlueCo set to change direction with new Chelsea transfer policy",

    "fullText": "MILAN — Federica Brignone has skied in five Winter Olympics, but her experience this year has been unique. For starters, she won her first gold medals. She also had an easier commute.\n\n“I had never arrived at an Olympics with my car,” Brignone, who was born in Milan and lives in Northern Italy, told reporters before the Games. “Usually it was always hotels, all shuttles, everything already organized.”\n\nOlympics Ratings Remain White-Hot as USA Sniffs Double Hockey Gold\n\nAlysa Liu's Figure Skating Gold Breaks 24-Year U.S. Olympic Drought\n\nFigure Skating, Hockey Fans Face Overlapping Schedule\n\nFamiliar comforts may be one of many factors driving the resurgent Olympics performance of Brignone and the rest of her Italian teammates. With a few events remaining this weekend, Italy has won 26 medals and nine golds at this year’s Winter Games, both records for the country. After ranking 10th in the medal table four years ago in Beijing, Italy sits in third so far this year, behind Norway and the United States.\n\nThe host boost is a trend that holds across both the Summer and Winter Olympics in recent decades. Since World War II, 18 of 19 Winter Olympics hosts—and 17 of 19 in the summer—have improved their medal counts from the previous games, with a median increase of 60% and a median gold medal increase of more than 75%. Ironically, the lone exception was Italy in 2006, when it won two fewer medals in Turin than it did in 2002.\n\nHost nations typically have a long run-up of preparation—Italy was awarded the 2026 Games seven years ago—meaning the country can dedicate time, money and infrastructure to its Olympic pursuits. While some countries allocate part of their Olympic budgets or resources to high-performance training, the Italian national team told Sportico that the $6.1 billion (€5.2 billion) Milan Cortina budget did not directly increase the country’s funding for its athlete development.\n\n“The medals are the result of hard work,” a spokesperson for the Italian national Olympic committee (CONI) said in an email. “We have not given the athletes any additional funding. We have assisted them in their preparation and with their staffing needs.”\n\nFrom a medal perspective, the return on investment was a jackpot. Great Britain won 29 golds in 2012, up from 19 in 2008 and still the nation’s biggest haul ever.\n\nTechnical and scientific support for the Italian athletes this year came via the country’s Olympic training centers (Centri di Preparazione Olimpica) and the Institute of Sports Medicine and Science (l’Istituto di Medicina e Scienza dello Sport), the CONI spokesperson said. The result of that push, he added, has shown in other avenues. Italy finished atop the gold medal count at the 2024 Winter Youth Olympics in South Korea, beating out France, Germany and the event hosts. Italy wasn’t in the top 10 for the 2012, 2016 or 2020 iterations of that event.\n\nItalian standouts during these Olympics include Brignone, who Corriere dello Sport hailed as “The Queen”; speedskater Francesca Lollobrigida, who won two gold medals; and the nation’s first-everbiathlon gold medalist Lisa Vittozzi. Italy also secured a surprise bronze medal in the team figure skating event. Pairs skater Sara Conti said afterward that the local support helped her team.\n\n“A competition is a competition,” she told reporters, “but when you feel the public behind you, that makes things much easier.”\n\nThere are a few structural factors that benefit Olympic hosts. For one, organizing committees can push to add new sports or new disciplines, and often do so in ways that boost their medal hauls. The lineup for the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles, for example, includes newcomers flag football, lacrosse, baseball and softball, all sports where the U.S. teams will likely be medal favorites.\n\nThe Winter Olympics introduces new events more gradually than the Summer Games, but several host countries have capitalized on new medal opportunities. For instance, the United States won both gold medals in skeleton when the discipline was resurrected (after a half-century hiatus) in Salt Lake City in 2002, and Russia won gold in men’s parallel slalom in that snowboarding event’s first iteration in 2014.\n\nThese Winter Games featured one new sport—ski mountaineering, or skimo—which features a number of prominent Italians. The hosts failed to medal in the men’s and women’s sprint on Thursday, but have another shot in Saturday’s mixed relay. Another new medal event, women’s doubles luge, produced an Italian gold. The host nation also auto-qualifies in many Olympic sports and receives additional slots in others, though those rarely result in medals. The Italian men’s hockey team, which didn’t have to qualify for the tournament, was winless in four games and was outscored 22-4.\n\nLastly, there are also more medals available by absence. Due to sanctions from the ongoing war in Ukraine, the Russian contingent has fewer than two dozen athletes at the 2026 Winter Games, competing as “individual neutral athletes,” and they’ve won one medal. By contrast, Russia initially claimed 33 medals, more than the U.S. or Canada, when it hosted the Olympics in 2014. Four of those medals were stripped for doping at those Sochi Games, bringing the final count to 29. Its athletes won 17 and 32 medals in the 2018 and 2022 Winter Games, when they faced separate restrictions due to doping violations.\n\nThe increased medal haul doesn’t mean the local Olympics have been blemish-free for Italy. The spread-out nature of the Games has diluted the overall Olympic energy in Milan. Offensive and gaffe-riddled commentary during the Opening Ceremony prompted the resignation of Paolo Petrecca, the sports head of RAI, the Italian state broadcaster.\n\nMLS Franchise Valuations Ranking List: From Inter Miami CF to CF Montréal\n\nTennis Prize Money Tracker: Which Player Has Earned the Most in 2026?\n\nFormula 1 Team Value 2025 Rankings",

    "fullText": "Team India bowling coach Morne Morkel dismissed any talk of dropping him and said, \"Absolutely no discussion on Abhishek Sharma in the group. He is going to deliver, for the team and viewers. He is entertaining. He is hitting the ball well in the nets.\"\n\nFormer India captain Sunil Gavaskar feels pressure is affecting the 25-year-old batter. He believes Abhishek is trying too hard to hit big shots from the first ball instead of settling in. \n\n“Abhishek Sharma is a lovely guy, but expectations seem to be weighing on him. If he had started well against the USA, it would have been different. Now, the pressure of being the big six-hitter and top batter is showing,\" Gavaskar said.\n\n\"With his shot range, he needs to spend time in the middle. He cannot try to hit a boundary or six on the first ball of his innings. If the big shots come, fine. But he shouldn’t force himself to play the big shots across the line,” he added.\n\nHe also advised Abhishek to start slowly and build his innings. \n\n“Take a single and get off the mark. Even four dot balls don’t matter. He can make up for them later. He needs to play smart. Spend an hour or two settling in, then play his natural game. First, just get off the mark. Every batter wants that first run. Once he gets it, everything will fall into place,” he added.\n\nAssistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate also backed Abhishek and said he showed good form in training after recovering from illness. \n\nHe said Abhishek batted well in the nets and should be fine in the next phase.\n\nWith India reaching the Super 8s, the team hopes Abhishek will regain confidence and perform when it matters most.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s midfield will be severely weakened following Casemiro’s summer exit.\n\nThe Brazilian, who had lost his way under Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim, has been in scintillating form this season and has been an ever-present member of the starting XI under Michael Carrick.\n\nThere were murmurs that INEOS were considering offering a short-term deal on the condition that the former Real Madrid superstar agreed to take a pay cut.\n\nThat did not materialise, and the defensive midfielder ended up announcing his departure five months ahead of time.\n\nUnited are likely to target the addition of two midfielders to compensate for losing the 33-year-old. As for the five-time Champions League winner, he is trying to find his next home.\n\nThere are offers from the Middle East as well as his homeland, but he seems to prefer a switch across the Atlantic.\n\nAmong the numerous Major League Soccer clubs eyeing his signature, one of them is Inter Miami, owned by United legend David Beckham.\n\nAccording to The Sun, Casemiro has been spotted scouting the area in Florida, hinting at a possible move.\n\n“Casemiro has drawn interest from both Inter Miami and his boyhood club. The Brazil legend will leave Old Trafford when his contract expires at the end of the season.\n\n“Casemiro, who turns 34 next week, was spotted enjoying a mini winter break in Miami with wife Anna this week.\n\n“SunSport understands that Casemiro was in Florida to scout the area as he considers his options after the US World Cup in June.\n\n“Miami has placed Casemiro high on their midfield wishlist as they prepare for life without Sergio Busquets, who plans to retire at the end of the MLS campaign.”\n\nA move to the Chase Stadium would see Casemiro reunite with former Barcelona foe Lionel Messi.

That’s how Russia’s domination of Olympic women’s figure skating ended.\n\nAdeliia Petrosian came to Milan as one of the few leading medal contenders on the 13-strong “individual neutral athlete” delegation of Russians competing without the country’s flag and symbols.\n\nSports: Elieen Gu Bounces Back In Women's Halfpipe Following Wicked Opening Run Crash\n\nStarting the day fifth in the standings, Petrosian’s medal hopes rested on her not-so-secret weapon, quadruple jumps which no one else in the event could perform.\n\nPetrosian planned two, fell on the first quad toeloop and thought she’d like to “get up and leave quickly,” she said. The 18-year-old skater didn’t risk a second quad attempt.\n\nPetrosian said returning to Russia would be “mentally hard” and that she blamed herself.\n\n“Right now I’m just a bit ashamed for myself, the federation, the coaches, the spectators that it turned out like that,” she added.\n\nPetrosian was sixth, while Alysa Liu won a historic gold for the U.S. It was the first time since 2010 that a Russian skater didn’t win the women’s gold. There were no medals of any kind in figure skating at these Olympics for the sport’s longtime superpower, which had only two competitors.\n\nLike this article? Keep independent journalism alive.

Her skate came amid a gradual loosening of restrictions on Russian athletes in international sports.\n\nAthletes from Russia and its ally Belarus are set to compete with their national flags and anthems at next month’s Paralympics for the first time since 2022. The International Olympic Committee has recommended similar steps for Russian youth athletes since December.\n\nUkraine’s sports minister Matvii Bidnyi told The Associated Press this month that any change to Russia’s Olympic status would be “irresponsible” and appear to condone Russia’s invasion as the war’s fourth anniversary approaches.\n\nAsked what she thought about her fans in the crowd being unable to fly Russian flags — barred from the Games under the IOC’s neutral athlete rules — and about a potential Russian return to the Olympics, Petrosian opted simply to praise her fans.\n\n“I heard everything they were shouting, how our Russian-speaking spectators supported me,” Petrosian said. “Of course it’s pleasant.”\n\nIn Case You Missed Alysa Liu's Censored Outburst, Here's Your Chance To See It\n\nGolden Comeback: Alysa Liu Ends U.S. Medal Drought With Near-Flawless Free Skate\n\nAlysa Liu Is Do-It-Your-Way Goals After Gliding Her Way To Gold",

The state has 38 senators, and the bill, titled officially CS/CS/SB 178, was unanimously passed by a vote of 38-0.\n\nThe bill reads, \". . .the Florida High School Athletic Association to adopt bylaws authorizing a head coach to support the welfare of a student by using personal funds to provide certain effects to the student; requiring the head coach to report such use of personal funds to the association; providing that such use of personal funds is presumed not to be an impermissible benefit, etc.\"\n\nBridgewater returned to his alma mater to become their head football coach in 2024. He made his impact known quickly by leading them to a Class 3A state title in 2024. Shortly after that accomplishment, he admitted to covering food and transportation costs for his players to improve their living conditions and ensure their safety getting to and from football-related activities.\n\nWhile Bridgewater's high school coaching career was cut short, he can at least feel good knowing his sacrifice at the time will leave a lasting impact on not only his community but the entire state of Florida.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bucs Wire: Florida Senate passes Teddy Bridgewater Act for coaches to help",

    "description": "The Packers offensive line underperformed in 2025, and there are question marks at each position up front entering 2026.",
    "fullText": "The Green Bay Packers underperformed along the offensive line in nearly every meaningful way during the 2025 season. Pass protection. Run blocking. Continuity. Development. Last month, Mark Oldacres of Packers Wire did a terrific job of highlighting the unusually poor season from the offensive line here. When push came to shove, a disappointing second half from the Packers offensive line stunted the offense and allowed the Chicago Bears the opportunity to mount a historic comeback -- knocking Matt LaFleur's team out of the playoffs in the wild card round for the second straight season.\n\nA top priority for the Packers in 2026 will be engineering improvement along the offensive line, but question marks are abundant entering the offseason.\n\nAt each position up front on offense, the Packers have at least one question mark. This won't even get into depth issues -- we're only discussing likely starters here.\n\nWill Rasheed Walker depart in free agency, and is Jordan Morgan up to the task if Walker leaves? Walker looks all but guaranteed to depart. He's a top free agent offensive lineman in the class, and there will be teams needing better left tackle play who are willing to pay the price. Assuming Walker leaves, the left tackle position will transition into the hands of Jordan Morgan, a 2024 first-round pick who has bounced around to various positions over his first two seasons. He'll need to settle in quick at left tackle. The good news: Morgan was a collegiate left tackle at Arizona, and he played some of his best football as a pro at left tackle in the preseason of 2025 and at right tackle to end the regular season. It's possible he could give the Packers improvement over Walker as soon as 2026. But there are always question marks when a new player is taking over a premium position.\n\nWill Aaron Banks return, and can be bounce back from a disappointing and injury-plagued first season? The Packers thought they were driving improvement on the interior when they signed Banks to a big deal in free agency and moved Elgton Jenkins to center in 2025. It never happened. Banks was injured in one way or another for the better part of two months to start the season, and he ended up as a below average starter at left guard by the end of 2025. He needs to stay healthy and play a lot better in 2026. Of course, there's a chance the Packers balk at paying his massive roster bonus in March and decide to part ways, creating a big hole at left guard entering free agency and the draft. Green Bay might be stuck between a rock and a hard place -- paying big for an average left guard, or parting ways and further weakening the offensive line.\n\nWho will be the center in 2026? Moving to Elgton Jenkins to center accomplished little, and he's almost certainly going to be cut at some point this offseason. Sean Rhyan flashed as a run blocker at center, but the Packers have benched him multiple times as a guard, and he's far from a guarantee to improve as a center. Also, Rhyan is a free agent, and it's possible the market will value him far higher than the Packers. Jacob Monk is probably not a long-term starting option. So where do the Packers go from here? Overpay to keep Rhyan, who might never be more than just a guy? Get aggressive to find a capable starter in free agency? Target one in the draft class? I picked center as the most important need position for the Packers to solve this offseason.\n\nCan Anthony Belton improve in Year 2? Belton, a second-round pick who was first trained as a tackle, took over as the starter at right guard midseason and provided some flashes of mauling run-blocking ability down the stretch. But he was also highly inconsistent, and his down to down struggles as a pass blocker were evident in several big spots. It's fair to expect improvement. He'll get an offseason and training camp to settle into the guard position after playing mostly tackle in college and bouncing around the line as a rookie. But improvement is never guaranteed for a young player. Of the 71 guards who played at least 400 snaps in 2025, Belton ranked 68th in PFF grade.\n\nWill Zach Tom be affected by his knee injury? Tom suffered a partially torn patellar tendon in Week 15 and missed the rest of the season. The offensive line fell apart in Denver and never really steadied the rest of the way. Tom is expected to have surgery, but the Packers are confident his 2026 season won't be affected. Still, this is a major injury for an offensive lineman -- and surgery on even a partial tear requires a long recovery process. The Packers need Tom -- their best offensive lineman -- to be available and at his best in 2026. He had a nightmarish 2025 season on the injury front, and his absences affected the whole unit.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: Question marks for each position along Packers offensive line",

    "description": "It might take the richest contract ever given to a center to bring Linderbaum to New York. Is he worth it?",
    "fullText": "Tyler Linderbaum might be at the top of the New York Giants’ NFL free agency wish list as they aim to upgrade in the trenches. Getting him, though, is not going to be easy. “Everybody” wants Linderbaum, according to NFL Network draft analyst Daniel Jeremiah.\n\n“I love my job, but if I could switch jobs for just the next couple months I’d want to be Tyler Linderbaum’s agent,” Jeremiah said Thursday on a pre-NFL Scouting Combine call with media. ‘Everybody that I talk to seems to be in on Tyler Linderbaum. It sounds like he’s going to have a robust market.“\n\nLinderbaum, of course, was the center for Giants coach John Harbaugh with the Baltimore Ravens for the past four years. The 25th pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, Linderbaum was named to the Pro Bowl in each of his last three seasons.\n\nEntering his age 26 season, Linderbaum is about to be a very rich young man. Creed Humphrey of the Kansas City Chiefs is the league’s highest-paid center. He signed a four-year, $72 million contract, an average of $18 million per year.\n\nLinderbaum’s contract, especially with a “robust market,” figures to equal or exceed that figure.\n\nThe Ravens are hoping to keep Linderbaum in Baltimore.\n\n“We got some work to do on Tyler Linderbaum’s contract,” DeCosta said on ‘The Inner Circle Podcast.’ “We strongly hope to have him back. He’s a great player for us and a great leader.”\n\nDo the Giants “need” Linderbaum badly enough to be willing to reset the center market financially? Perhaps not. John Michael Schmitz is a capable center who has improved in each of his first three seasons.\n\nLinderbaum, though, would be an upgrade. Harbaugh, who has said consistently that continuing to upgrade the talent on both the offensive and defensive lines is a must for the Giants, might be willing to do whatever it takes to get the player who orchestrated his offensive line in Baltimore.\n\nIs Linderbaum worth the biggest contract ever given to a center, Giants fans?",

The Red Devils are out for revenge and sit one point above the west London outfit in the Women’s Super League table. This is also a primer for next month’s League Cup final and promises to be a cracker.\n\nThere’s also the Merseyside Derby between Liverpool and Everton later in the day.

Third-placed Napoli are in a strong position to qualify for next year’s UEFA Champions League, but with Juventus just four points adrift in fifth, they cannot afford to drop many points with 13 games to go.\n\nAtalanta, who are five points off the top four, are outsiders to qualify for the competition, but a win here would make a huge statement. Their poor start to the campaign has been firmly put behind them under new manager Raffaele Palladino, who is yet to oversee a league defeat in 2026.\n\nLa Dea also cannot afford to drop points at this stage of the season given they are neck and neck with Cesc Fabregas’ Como, who occupy sixth place and the UEFA Conference League qualifying spot.\n\nKick-off: 2pm, Sunday 22nd February\n\nWhere to watch: BBC Alba, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website, DAZN\n\nRead – Every player to score four goals in a Champions League game\n\nThe form side in the Bundesliga is not Bayern Munich, but Borussia Dortmund.

Their neighbours are in disarray and sacked their head coach after failing to win a single Premier League game in 2026 so far. But Mikel Arteta’s men are having problems of their own; their title charge is starting to come off the tracks after winning just two of their last seven games.\n\nThe total chaos displayed at the back in the lead-up to Wolves’ late equaliser in midweek screamed of a team creaking under the pressure. But the question is: do Spurs have the means to take advantage?\n\nThe Lilywhites were dismantled when they went to the Emirates Stadium earlier this season, but they have a new man in the hot seat. The combination of a new manager bounce from Igor Tudor and the desperation to stop their biggest rivals winning the title gives them added hope of getting something from a team on edge.\n\nKick-off: 4.30pm, Sunday 22nd February\n\nWhere to watch: Sky Sports Main Event, Sky Sports Premier League\n\nPower Rankings – Arsenal slip, Barça slide, Real Madrid rise\n\nSee Also – Chelsea defender cites Liverpool duo as role models\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube | TikTok",

    "fullText": "Gold medalist Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo of Norway competes during the team sprint free at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympic Games on Feb 18, 2026. Credit - Davide Barbieri—NordicFocus/Getty Images\n\nWhen Norwegian cross-country skier Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo crossed the finish line first on Feb. 18, giving this country a victory in the men’s team sprint free event, he certified himself as the Winter Olympics GOAT. Klaebo, 29, won his fifth Olympic gold of these Milano Cortina Games, in five events, and became the first Winter Olympian ever to reach the double-digit mark in career gold medals. Klaebo goes for No. 11, on Saturday, in the 50-km mass start classic.\n\nWhile prepping for the most prestigious race on the cross-country program, Klaebo took a break to talk to TIME about a wide range of subjects, including how Norway’s youth sports system produces Olympic champions, why he’s not spending much time with his family and fiancée, cross-country memes, and what’s on his bucket list.\n\n[This interview has been condensed for length and clarity]\n\nYou’ve won five gold medals during these Winter Olympics, set the new all-time winter record with 10 golds in your Olympic career, and if you win the 50-km mass start classic on Saturday, you’d be the first Winter Olympian to ever win six golds at the same Games. So what’s going through your mind right now?\n\nI'm just trying to let everything sink in a little bit. Really eager to do well on Saturday. So it's kind of finding the balance, in terms of how much you will enjoy the moment and how much you are trying to prepare yourself for what's ahead. So far it feels really good. And now, with just one more race to go, it's going to be nice to wrap it all up.\n\nSo what can you do to enjoy the moments, knowing that you’ve still got work to do?\n\nWe have a pretty good team here. So we try to stick together. We are eating long dinners. We have long lunches. When it comes to enjoying it too much, I have my family here and everything and just decided that's going to be too much. I don't have time to do everything. Having my girlfriend here as well, it's been just FaceTime. I haven’t been able to see her more than just saying hi at the stadium. So I think that's kind of the balance we are trying to figure out.\n\nSo you haven't seen your family or your fiancée in person, besides hugging after race victories? You haven’t had long dinners with them or anything? It's just with your team?\n\nAbsolutely. The last time I was back home was the start of January. I was there for two days. Besides that, I haven't been home since the start of December. I have 250 days away from home every single year. I tried to bring my fiancée as much as possible. But during the Olympics, with the accreditation and all these kinds of things, it’s really strict. It's easier for her to stay with my family and just have fun. Then I will join them on Saturday.\n\nWhat are you going to do on Saturday night, win or lose?\n\nWe're going to have a nice dinner. That's kind of the minimum of what we're going to do. When I look back at this Olympics, they will for sure be unbelievable anyways. But it'd be cool to finish it up with this total sweep. So we'll see.\n\nWhat’s been your favorite long meal with your team so far? What have you had to eat?\n\nI'm pretty strict in terms of what I'm eating. During the Olympics, there's a lot of rice, chicken, and vegetables. So it's quite a boring dinner. The nice part is that we're actually sitting there for a long time, just trying to speak about the races. We speak about how privileged we are to be here and to enjoy this. This is my third Olympics. The last one in Beijing, for us athletes, you needed to test for COVID twice per day. We were eating with boxes on the side. It felt more like work. Here it feels like this is what I like to do. This is more my hobby. I think that is making a big difference, mentally especially.\n\nPeople are fascinated by Norway’s Winter Olympic dominance. And a lot has been made about the youth sports system there, that keeping score is not allowed in kids’ games. Is that really true? In cross-country, if you finish first, isn’t it obvious that you won?\n\nWhen you're younger, like 8 to 12, if you're starting first, your name will be first on the start list, but on the side you will see your time. So say that you're 3 min. and 40 sec., and then the last one on the starting list is 3 min. and 28 sec. He was faster, but you needed to go into that and kind of look.\n\nAh, so they don’t put the results in order, just the start.\n\nThe reason is we want everyone to stay along for as long as possible. They try to not focus too much on the results. They're focusing more on participation and that people are there and having fun and enjoying the races, more than who is winning.\n\nAnd you played other sports, I believe, besides cross-country. What are some of the other sports you tried?\n\nI did a lot of things. I played soccer. That was kind of what I wanted to be when I grew up. But it didn't turn up that way. Then I was doing a little bit of track and field. I was cycling a little bit. I tried biathlon. I was playing an instrument. So I did a lot of things when I grew up, but the majority of my time was spent on the soccer field and also out running and doing stuff for cross-country.\n\nDo you think the fact that you played all these different sports at least partially explains why we're seeing these results from you?\n\nI think so. It's good when you are younger to try different sports and to be able to learn different patterns and movements. Then at some point you need to decide for sure. But I didn't decide before I was about 16. I still played soccer until I was close to 20. When you're playing soccer, you're doing shorter sprints, you're being a little bit more explosive. When you're cross-country skiing, it's more like endurance. It's a mix of everything. And that was what I tried to do when I was younger, to see if I can combine it as much as possible. And then these days, I think that has helped me a lot to be able to be at my best.\n\nYour uphill sprint has gone viral. Have you enjoyed seeing the memes? What's your favorite one?\n\nThe one I think is the most fun is you see how fast I'm running, and then when people are just then trying to do the same on the treadmill. You see it's actually quite fast. It's cool to see that cross-country skiing has kind of gone a little bit viral, and to see people getting their eyes opened to what we are doing in cross-country skiing.\n\nI'm from the United States, and on the men’s side, America has had its first Olympic cross-country medalists in 50 years. But cross-country is not beloved like it is in Norway. What do you want people to know in the United States, and other places around the world, about your sport that maybe they don't realize or don't see or don't appreciate?\n\nA lot of people think it's all about endurance. But the good part about doing cross-country skiing is that we're using our legs, we're using the upper body, and you're using your endurance. Meaning that it's one of the healthiest sports you can do when it comes to staying active. I know that in the U.S., it's not possible to go skiing everywhere, as it is in Norway during the winter. But you can go roller skiing, which is pretty much the same. You're still using your upper and lower body and endurance. It's really less injury risk than doing cycling or running.\n\nHas anyone from another sport tried to recruit you?\n\nI’ve gotten some questions about cycling. I'm close to 30 now, so I think it's a little bit too late to start exploring. I think I will stick to cross-country skiing.\n\nMichael Phelps has the all-time Olympic record, with 23 golds. You might get 11 once you’re through here. Might you try to catch him? Is that a goal of yours, to become the all-time gold-medal winner in Olympic history?\n\nThat's going to be hard. Because then I need to do two more Olympics, and I need to win every single event. That will be quite crazy. I’m second. I think I’m going to stay second. It's cool to get the question. But I don't think it's that realistic, to be honest.\n\nBut when I say you're the greatest Winter Olympian of all time, do you agree with that?\n\nIt’s pretty crazy to hear that. It's unbelievable. My goal when I was younger was to be able to do cross-country skiing for a living. It’s just been way more than I could ever expect or dream about.\n\nSome people would try to play down the Winter Olympics GOAT label. But it sounds like you accept that title. Fair?\n\nThe good part is that we actually have the numbers for it. For me, I will never try to go down that lane. To be honest, I think there are so many great athletes participating in the Olympics, whether it's freeskiing or it's skeleton. It's pretty sick to have the record, for sure. But I think it's important to mention that there are so many good athletes out there, and I have a huge respect for what everyone is accomplishing.\n\nYou can obviously do it all in your sport. The sprints and the distance. But what excites you about doing the 50-km distance race? What's the challenge of it?\n\nThere are so many changes during the race. You can feel really good after 20 km and then you can feel terrible after 30 km. You're going through so many different emotions. That’s the beauty about it. At some point you will be really tired, and at some point you will feel like you are unstoppable. You're two hours staying in your own head. You're just kind of working against yourself on so many levels.\n\nAny fun facts people should know about you?\n\nWhen I prepare myself for a race. I always play my PlayStation. So if you see back here, this is kind of my setup. [Shows gaming desk on video.] During summer, I like to play golf. When I had a couple of training camps in Utah, I always used to bring my golf clubs to be able to play a little bit on the rest days.\n\nI’m sure you can keep your anonymity in Utah, though that may soon change.\n\nYeah, it's definitely a big difference. In Utah, it's easy. No one is recognizing you. I can just do my thing. It's actually very good when it comes to the altitude and all the terrain and everything. Roller skiing and cycling. It's really been a perfect place for me to stay.\n\nWhat's difficult about being a celebrity in Norway?\n\nI wouldn't say that it's difficult. But if you're going to just do your grocery shopping, it's not always that you are feeling at your best, stopping and getting your picture taken and everything. That's part of the game. Sometimes you would like to not get recognized. But on the other hand, I feel really privileged that people are watching our races and following us. It's very important for me to give back. I always try to say yes, because I remember how it was when I was younger. I had someone I looked up to and wanted to take a picture with. I would feel bad if that person didn't stop and say hi.\n\nOK, a few quick ones to wrap up. What’s a bucket-list thing you want to do in life that you haven't done yet?\n\nThat's actually a really hard question. I don't know if it's a bucket list, but the plan is to go to the World Cup. I have a few friends that play on the national team in Norway. So I will travel to New York and then fly out to Boston to see the Norwegian team start their World Cup. That's something I'm really looking forward to.\n\nAre you friends with Erling Haaland?\n\nNot really. We have a few of the same sponsors. But Alexander Sørloth, another striker, is a good friend of mine. We normally have a vacation together every year. So we'll go to watch them, and then hopefully in the summer we'll have a vacation when they're done with the World Cup. Hopefully after a long World Cup for Norway.\n\nWe actually did a cover story on Erling last year, and he talked about how he eats cow heart. Do you eat cow heart too?\n\nOh no. I don't eat cow heart. But it’s kind of the same philosophy. It's all about eating clean. So we're eating clean meats. All of us are trying to optimize our body. The nutrition part is very important. I have this place where I always buy my meat. The next thing is going to be cow hearts, I guess.\n\nWhat is the biggest challenge you've had in your life, and how did you overcome it?\n\nOne of the biggest ones was when I was 15. That was when I made my decision that I wanted to do cross-country skiing. And at that time I was around 100 in Norway on the result list. I was really small when I was 15. It was hard to compete against people that were twice as high as I was. I really, really struggled on the races. But I kept being patient and focusing on the thing that I could put my energy on, which was my technique and my balance. It took a couple of years before I started to grow. But when I first started to grow, I was starting to fight for the top positions in my country for my age. And that was nice.\n\nEspecially if you complete the six-gold sweep on Saturday and make more Olympic history, you’re going to be in high demand. Now’s the time to, say, meet anyone in the world you want. Who would you love to meet and spend some time with?\n\nIt would be cool to meet some of the big stars on the PGA Tour.\n\nI know that he's not a part of the PGA tour that much right now, but Tiger Woods is one of the biggest there has ever been. He would definitely be up there.\n\nHave you ever been to the Masters?\n\nNever. That would be one of the coolest things to do.\n\nIf you win, you can request an invite right now to the Augusta National folks.\n\nWell, I hope they read this and do the right thing. You deserve it, Come on, Augusta.\n\nWrite to Sean Gregory at sean.gregory@time.com.",

    "fullText": "Coach Curt Cignetti brought a national championship to Indiana football, and he's being paid handsomely for it.\n\nThe second-year Hoosiers coach received a new contract on Friday, Feb. 20, according to the IndyStar, part of the USA TODAY Network. It's his third contract revision at Indiana, and will pay him an average of $13.2 million per season, among the highest in college sports.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Five college football hot seats I can't stop thinking about for 2026\n\nIndiana and Cignetti capped off a perfect 16-0 season with their national championship win over Miami in January, which came two seasons after the Hoosiers went 3-9 in Tom Allen's last season as head coach. The program entered the 2025-26 season with three bowl wins ever, yet won three CFP games en route to a title.\n\nIt's clear Indiana is continuing to invest in its skyrocketing football program, and it doesn't seem like they're leaving anywhere soon.\n\nHere's everything to know of Cignetti's new contract:\n\nCignetti's new contract will pay him an average annual salary of $13.2 million through 2033. His previous contract was also through 2033, but was for $11.6 million per season.\n\nThe contract makes him among the highest-paid coach in college sports, next to LSU's Lane Kiffin and Georgia's Kirby Smart, who are also making $13 million or more per season on average. Kiffin signed a seven-year, $91 million deal with LSU after leaving Ole Miss and Smart is on a 13-year, $130 million contract.\n\nCignetti's contract he signed in October featured a clause that called for a \"good faith market review\" of his deal within 120 days of Indiana reaching the CFP semifinals, should it ever reach it. The contract is also designed to keep him within the top three of highest-paid coaches in college football.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Curt Cignetti contract: Indiana football gives raise after CFP title",

    "fullText": "Two more Georgia Bulldogs football players have been arrested. Georgia already had walk-on defensive lineman London Seymour arrested this offseason. Seymour faces 11 felonies.\n\nGeorgia linebackers Chris Cole and Darren Ikinnagbon were both arrested and later released on Wednesday, Feb. 18. Both players were charged with misdemeanors including reckless driving.\n\nCole was arrested at 9:59 p.m. ET according to Athens-Clarke County online jail records. He was charged with reckless driving and speeding, which are both misdemeanors. Cole was released after paying $26 in bonds.\n\nIkinnagbon was arrested at 10:27 p.m. ET. He was charged with reckless driving, speeding and following too closely, which are all misdemeanors. Ikinnagbon was released after paying $39 in bonds.\n\nCole and Ikinnagbon are Georgia's latest players to be arrested for a driving incident following the tragic deaths of Georgia recruiting analyst Chandler LeCroy and Devon Willock in a 2023 car crash. Georgia did not specify if either player is facing discipline, but the Bulldogs have dismissed three players from driving incidents since the spring of 2025.\n\nCole led Georgia in sacks with 4 1/2 during the 2025 season. Ikinnagbon appeared in five games in his freshman season in 2025 and posted two tackles.\n\n\"I want to apologize for my actions and poor decision I made yesterday in Athens,\" Ikinnagbon said in a statement after his arrest. \"As a member of the University of Georgia football team, I recognize that my behavior fell short of the standards expected from anyone who represents this program.\"\n\nIkinnagbon added further in his full statement (below).

They’re followed by Pavin Smith as the designated hitter, with catcher Gabriel Moreno in the cleanup spot.\n\nThe team has also added veterans Nolan Arenado and Carlos Santana — playing for Arizona for the first time — into the mix, along with young outfielders Alek Thomas, Ryan Waldschmidt and Jorge Barrosa to round out the batting order.\n\nArizona Diamondbacks’ Pavin Smith during spring training workouts at Salt River Fields on Feb. 16, 2026, in Scottsdale. © Rob Schumacher/The Republic / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images\n\nRight-handed pitcher Thomas Hatch will open the game for Arizona.

    "description": "Shedeur Sanders made an undeniable impact on Colorado football, which helped him earn a spot on ESPN's top 100 quarterbacks of the 2000s list.",
    "fullText": "Following the 2025 Colorado Buffaloes season and Shedeur Sanders' rollercoaster, it might be hard to remember that just over two years ago, Sanders was leading the charge of rebuilding Colorado football.\n\nAlongside Travis Hunter and his father, Deion Sanders, Shedeur played a key part in reviving a stagnant program during a time of conference uncertainty. It's part of the reason why so many No. 12 jerseys, both of black and gold and brown and orange, can be found across the nation, especially in Boulder. For his efforts, he was also recently named to ESPN's list of the top 100 quarterbacks of the 2000s.\n\nSanders slots in at No. 87, right in between Western Kentucky's Bailey Zappe and Miami's Carson Beck. The list only counts years in the FBS, of which Sanders played two, totaling 7,364 passing yards, 64 touchdowns and only 13 interceptions. Throughout his two-year stint in the FBS, in which he threw over 900 times, Sanders set a new record for completion percentage in a career at 71.8%.\n\nDuring the Buffaloes 9-4 season, Sanders threw for 4,134 yards, 37 touchdowns and 10 interceptions, all while completeing 74% of his passes. His passing led the Big 12 in nearly every category that season, which led to his being drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the NFL.\n\n10 minutes of Shedeur Sanders’ highlights pic.twitter.com/AJMWtvrjvW\n\n— Colorado Buffaloes Football (@CUBuffsFootball) April 26, 2025\n\nWhile the list doesn't take it into account, Sanders was no slouch in the FCS ranks before landing in Colorado. Playing for his father at Jackson State for two years, Sanders threw for 70 touchdowns, nearly 7,000 yards and only 14 interceptions. Together, the Sanders' family lost only three games during their time with the Tigers, ending with an elite 23-3 record in that span.\n\nContact/Follow us @BuffaloesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook for ongoing coverage of Colorado news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Buffaloes Wire: Shedeur Sanders ranked on ESPN Top 100 quarterbacks of the 2000s",

    "fullText": "Union are still searching for their first win of 2026 after failing to win all of their seven Bundesliga matches since the turn of the year (D4, L3). In fact, Steffen Baumgart’s side have lost three of their previous four matches, including a 3-2 loss in last Saturday’s away clash against Hamburg. As a result of their poor form, Union have slipped into the bottom half of the table, although they still boast a healthy six-point gap to the bottom three.\n\nThey will be desperate to claim their first league win since December in Saturday’s home fixture, but that will be easier said than done for a club that has not beaten Leverkusen since picking up a 1-0 victory in January 2021. The first goal could dictate Union’s chances of victory, given the fact that they have failed to win any of the 11 Bundesliga games in which they have conceded first this term (D4, L7).\n\nUnion are unable to call upon the services of Diogo Leite, Tom Roth, Josip Juranović and Robert Skov.\n\nPredicted lineup: Rønnow; Doekhi, Querfeld, Nsoki; Haberer, Khedira, Kemlein, Köhn; Jeong, Burke; Ilić\n\nIn contrast to their hosts, Leverkusen will head into the weekend in high spirits after winning six of their previous seven competitive matches (D1), including their last two. Kasper Hjulmand's side cruised to a 4-0 victory in last Saturday’s Bundesliga home clash with St. Pauli, before they recorded a 2-0 success in Thursday’s Europa League meeting with Olympiacos. Patrik Schick’s quickfire brace has put Leverkusen in a strong position in their knockout phase playoff tie ahead of next week’s return leg at the BayArena.\n\nWhile they may have one eye on the second leg, Leverkusen will turn their focus back to their Champions League qualification bid. As it stands, Leverkusen are sitting in sixth spot and three points adrift of the top four after winning 12, drawing three and losing six of their 21 league matches this season.\n\nThey should fancy their chances of taking maximum points from Saturday’s fixture, having won four of their previous five games against Union, including a 2-0 victory in October’s reverse fixture.\n\nGoalkeeper Mark Flekken remains sidelined with a knee injury, while Eliesse Ben Seghir and Nathan Tella are out with ankle and foot injuries respectively.\n\nPredicted lineup: Blaswich; Quansah, Badé, Tapsoba; Arthur, Fernández, García, Grimaldo; Tillman, Terrier; Kofane",

    "description": "Former Saints LT Terron Armstead reveals that players wanted Dan Campbell to replace Sean Payton in 2019. A stunning what-if moment for the Lions.",
    "fullText": "Detroit Lions fans already know Dan Campbell is different. The emotion, the buy-in, the culture—none of it feels manufactured. And now, thanks to a revealing story from former New Orleans Saints left tackle Terron Armstead, we’ve learned just how deep that belief in Campbell ran years before he ever stepped foot in Detroit.\n\nBack in 2019, according to Armstead, some Saints players were so fed up with Sean Payton flirting with the Dallas Cowboys job that they were openly hoping Payton would leave—so Dan Campbell could take over as head coach.\n\nToward the end of Payton’s tenure in New Orleans, rumors swirled that he badly wanted the Cowboys job. Those whispers weren’t limited to media circles—they made their way into the locker room.\n\nThere’s even a now-infamous story from Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio suggesting the Saints and Cowboys had a deal in place in 2019, only for it to collapse because Anthony Davis requested a trade, putting Saints GM Mickey Loomis in an impossible optics situation—losing Payton and Davis in the same offseason.\n\nWild? Absolutely. But believable? Apparently enough that Saints players were already planning for life after Payton.\n\nAppearing on the St. Brown Podcast, Armstead didn’t sugarcoat how players felt at the time.\n\n“It was a point, we was damn-near petitioning to get Sean Payton to get up out of there,” Armstead said as quoted by Pride of Detroit. “We kept hearing rumors of Sean entertaining the Cowboys job, and we were like, ‘If Sean goes to Dallas, Dan Campbell is going to be our head coach. So, Sean, you do what’s best for you and your family. We’ve got Dan Campbell.’”\n\nThat quote hits different when you remember Campbell wasn’t even a coordinator. He was the assistant head coach and tight ends coach—and yet, the locker room already viewed him as their guy.\n\nWhat’s especially telling is that Armstead wasn’t even coached directly by Campbell. And it didn’t matter.\n\n“He was intense. He loves it. He loves the grind, he loves workers, he loves o-linemen,” Armstead said.\n“He loves to run the ball and be physical. He was incredible, bro. We loved Dan.”\n\nIf that sounds familiar to Lions fans… it should.\n\nThat’s the same identity Detroit has built:\n\nCoaches who mean it when they talk about work\n\nCampbell didn’t grow into this persona in Detroit. This is who he’s always been.\n\nHere’s the part that should make Lions fans pause for a second.\n\nIf Payton had gone to Dallas in 2019—and Campbell had taken over the Saints—he almost certainly wouldn’t have been available in 2021, when Detroit hired him.\n\nWhich raises the uncomfortable (but fascinating) question: Where would the Lions be right now without Dan Campbell?\n\nIt’s hard to imagine Detroit’s turnaround without him. The culture shift. The trust. The emotional edge. All of it traces back to Campbell being in the right place at the right time.\n\nSometimes franchise-altering moments don’t happen on draft night or in free agency. Sometimes they happen because a different team didn’t make a move.\n\nThis story doesn’t diminish Sean Payton’s success. But it does reinforce something Lions fans have felt for years now:\n\nPlayers don’t just respect Dan Campbell—they believe in him.\n\nThey believed in him in New Orleans.\nThey believe in him in Detroit.\nAnd that belief is the foundation of everything the Lions are building right now.\n\nThe post The What-If That Could Have Changed Lions History Forever appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "description": "Jaylen Brown is upset after Beverly Hills police shut down his party during All-Star weekend.",
    "fullText": "The city of Beverly Hills has issued an apology to Jaylen Brown after police shut down his brand party during NBA All-Star Weekend. An apology might not be enough for the Boston Celtics star, though.\n\nPolice ended Brown's private party at 7 p.m. Saturday over apparent city code violations, city manager Nancy Hunt-Coffey said in a statement. Brown told ESPN's Marc Spears police were operating on \"biased information,\" leading to \"serious due-process concerns.\"\n\nA statement from the city of Beverly Hills confirmed police had at least some inaccurate information.\n\n\"Upon further internal review, the City has determined that its prior public communication contained inaccurate information,\" Beverly Hills' statement read. \"Specifically, no permit application was submitted nor denied for the event and the residence does not have any prior related violations on record. The City takes full accountability for the internal error that resulted in the inaccurate statement being distributed and is working to ensure it does not happen again.\"“The City’s previous statement about the weekend event at the Trousdale home was inaccurate, and on behalf of the City, I would like to apologize to Jaylen Brown and the Jannard family,” Hunt-Coffey added. “The City has a responsibility to its residents and neighborhoods to ensure adherence to established regulations for events held at private residences. These are designed to support the safety and welfare of neighbors and attendees. City staff observed circumstances that are believed to be City code violations and for that reason alone, the event was ended.”\n\nBrown is reportedly considering legal action against Beverly Hills. The five-time All-Star told ESPN he's not a litigious person but feels \"embarrassed\" and \"offended\" over an incident he says caused \"significant financial and reputational harm.\"\n\nThe event cost at least $600,000, according to ESPN, as Brown says he spent $300,000 while his sponsors contributed around $300,000 to $500,000. It's more than the money for Brown, however. It's also about losing an opportunity to discuss leadership and culture during the one weekend where the NBA's best and brightest come together.\n\n\"I wanted to enjoy myself, and I felt that got taken away,\" Brown told reporters after Thursday's win over the Golden State Warriors. \"I was embarrassed. If it happened to me, I'm sure it happened to a bunch of people in the past. I look at it like that. There are probably a bunch of people that don't scream, falls on deaf fears, which is unfortunate. I'm not sure what the conclusion is. ... Even the statement that they put out, they included some stuff that wasn't true, even in the apology.\n\n\"So I don't think the apology is acceptable. I lost a lot of money [with our] partners, et cetera. People were making assumptions that we didn't go through the proper protocols. So, all around it's just a bad taste in my mouth. I'm extremely offended. My team is offended. I'm not sure what the conclusion is going to be. All I know is it's some (expletive).\"\n\nBrown is expected to make a decision on whether he'll pursue legal action soon.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Is Jaylen Brown suing Bevery Hills after police incident?",

    "fullText": "Napoli midfielder Scott McTominay clarified the situation surrounding his future, especially reports linking him with other clubs over a potential move in the summer transfer window.\n\nSpeaking in an exclusive interview with Corriere dello Sport, the former Manchester United player poured cold water over rumours that suggested a move away for McTominay from Napoli. The Scottish midfielder charted his transfer from the Premier League to the Serie A, and then moved on to comment that his agent has talked with no other club regarding his future. He said: “My agent hasn’t spoken to anyone about my future. He only talks to the club and me. He hasn’t said anything to the newspapers. I’m extremely happy here, and as for me, I’m a Napoli player; that’s all I think about. The future is very important, and I could see myself at Napoli for a long time.”\n\nMcTominay further reinforced his statement by reporting that he and his family are pleased with the city of Naples and the club, which gave him a space to improve after leaving a tough situation at Manchester United. The 29-year-old remarked: “My family is happy, I’m happy. It’s a fantastic moment, I’ve experienced something different from the last year and a half. As long as everyone in my life is happy, I am too.”\n\nThe Napoli proceeded to explain his own role as a footballer on the pitch as he said: “I’ve always been a midfielder, a number 8 who can do a bit of everything: get in the mix, but also help the team in build-up play, in defence, someone who gives his teammates a hand, in short.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Diego Padres are in a bit of a tough spot right now, as they need a star pitcher to replace Dylan Cease, who left in free agency, but they are kind of short on money at the moment. While they did get Walker Buehler and German Marquez, they still don’t have a pitcher who went through 2025 with a decent season.\n\nFansided’s Robert Murray believes the Padres can find their answer in a former All-Star Lucas Giolito. He would an arm that performed well in 2025, and he could probably be bought on a discount.\n\nMORE: Proposed Twins signing sees Minnesota acquire $61 million All-Star, former Cy Young candidate ace as insurance for Pablo Lopez\n\n“The Padres have already signed Griffin Canning, Walker Buehler and German Marquez, but Giolito is in a different category. He adds a potential top-half-of-the-rotation arm to the mix with nine seasons of experience. He would further bolster a rotation that team executive A.J. Preller has set out to improve this winter. Does Preller have the funds necessary to get a deal done? We’ll see. He was creative in structuring Nick Pivetta’s deal last winter. Who says he can’t do it again? If he does, Giolito would be the cherry on top of an impressive offseason yet again for Preller and Co. despite financial constraints,” Kline wrote.\n\nGiolito finished 2025 with a 10-4 record, a 3.41 ERA, 121 Ks, and a WHIP of 1.290 over 145 innings pitched. He would replace Cease’s spot in the rotation, and fill out the front end quite nicely.\n\nMORE: Proposed Phillies trade sees Philadelphia deal Edmundo Sosa, Orion Kerkering to solve two major roster issues\n\nGiolito’s projected to receive a three-year, $61 million deal, but considering it’s so close to Opening Day and his market has received no interest, he could probably get acquired on a bargain. And for a money-conscious team like San Diego, that could be perfect.\n\nHopefully, the Padres get to work soon, as there are other equally desperate teams in need of an arm as well.\n\nBraves predicted to be forced into signing $61 million All-Star, former Cy Young candidate after latest Hurston Waldrep injury update\n\nMets predicted to cut ties with $2.5 million World Series champion, nine-time All-Star closer to make room in Devin Williams-led bullpen\n\nProposed Reds trade sees Cincinnati land $100 million two-time All-Star, Platinum Glove after missing out on Kyle Schwarber",

    "fullText": "Clemson basketball looks to stop a three-game losing skid when the Tigers host ACC rival Florida State Saturday at Littlejohn Coliseum.\n\nThe Tigers (20-7 overall, 10-4 conference), ranked No. 24 in the USA TODAY Sports Coaches Poll, may have lost by single digits on Wednesday night at Wake Forest, 85-77, but the game practically felt over when the Demon Deacons opened with a 22-8 run in the first eight-plus minutes and led 45-32 at halftime.\n\nClemson couldn't catch up, though the Tigers did briefly trim the deficit to five at one point early in the second half. They never got any closer thanks to Wake Forest's Juke Harris, who finished with a game-high 20 points. Harris, the ACC's third-leading scorer this season behind Duke's Cameron Boozer and Stanford's Ebuka Okorie, was one of five players to finish in double figures for the Deacs.\n\nJake Wahlin led Clemson with 17 points and fellow big man Carter Welling added 13, as did guard Ace Buckner. Wake Forest made 55 percent of its shots from the field, including 10 3-pointers.\n\nClemson's three-game losing streak is its longest since January 2024 when the Tigers opened ACC play 1-3 after consecutive losses to Miami, North Carolina and Virginia Tech after a 9-0 start.\n\nFlorida State (13-13, 6-7), meanwhile, is back to .500 after rallying for an 80-72 win over Boston College on Tuesday. The Seminoles have won five of their last seven games after rallying from a 10-point deficit at halftime and outscoring Boston College 48-30 in the second half.\n\nRobert McCray V led FSU with 27 points in the win over the Eagles, and Alex Steen added 13 points and eight rebounds. McCray leads the Seminoles in scoring with 15.2 points per game this season. Former Clemson star Chauncey Wiggins, who transferred to FSU after last season, is second with 12.6 PPG.\n\nClemson has won six straight against Florida State on the hardwood. Will the Tigers make it seven in a row to get back in the win column Saturday?\n\nAhead of Clemson-Florida State, ESPN's matchup predictor, which offers a prediction model based on its college basketball power index (BPI) and other variables, weighed in with its odds. ESPN's metrics give the Tigers an 87.8% chance to win and the Seminoles a 12.2% chance.\n\nClemson is 29th nationally in ESPN's latest BPI ratings, down two spots from last week. The Tigers have a 15.1 overall rating. The metrics give the Tigers a 5.9 rating on offense that ranks 54st nationally, and a 9.2 rating on defense that's 17th nationally.\n\nFlorida State is No. 85 in ESPN's BPI.

    "fullText": "Carol Foro has taken to social media to announce she will not be competing on March 28 as originally scheduled.\n\nIt has not been all that common lately for fighters on the roster to get pulled up for positive drug tests.\n\nMohammed Usman, for instance, is serving a suspension that runs through to 2028, after he was found in violation of the UFC’s Anti-Doping policy earlier this year.\n\nRather than sit out the entire length of his ban, Usman opted to cut ties with the organisation altogether.\n\nAnother fighter has now tested positive, but in this case, she chose to make the announcement public with an accompanying statement.\n\nOriginally, Israel Adesanya was set to return in 2025, but an injury during training delayed his comeback even further.\n\nInstead, he is back on March 28 at the Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle, headlining a Fight Night card that will no longer feature one of its previously scheduled fighters.\n\nCarol Foro had been slated to make her UFC debut next month against Stephanie Luciano until a new match-up was announced.\n\nOn February 18, Leo Walker Guimaraes reported that Luciano is now scheduled to face Alexia Thainara on that date, along with an explanation for the change.\n\nForo’s team took to Instagram to reveal she had tested positive for a diuretic in an out-of-competition test earlier this year, which led to her debut being scrapped.\n\nThey claim Foro did not take it “consciously or intentionally” and suspect it may have come from a supplement. This has prompted them to conduct tests in order to support their case.\n\nForo had been building momentum ahead of her planned UFC debut next month, largely because of how she impressed last September.\n\nHer place on the roster was earned by the Brazilian through Dana White’s Contender Series.\n\nIn episode five of that season, both Foro and her opponent Shanelle Dyer, despite Dyer losing her unbeaten record, secured contracts after a strong showing.\n\nFortunately for UFC Seattle, Alexia Thainara is also regarded as a prospect worth watching. Her stepping in is seen as a solid replacement for the card.\n\nAJ Cunningham’s UFC career cut short by injury as he retires at 31 years old\n\nIslam Makhachev fires warning shot to teammates over UFC roster cuts – change is needed",

    "description": "Adam Silver continues to look for an elusive solution to tanking, but even NBA owners don't agree on it.",
    "fullText": "During All-Star Weekend, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, \"We're going to be scrutinizing everything we see going forward\" regarding teams tanking, and that the league would be looking at \"every possible remedy.\"\n\nDuring a Thursday phone call with all 30 general managers, an adamant Silver said tanking needs to be curtailed for the integrity of the game and laid out potential remedies, according to multiple reports. According to ESPN’s Shams Charania, some of the potential moves discussed by Silver included:\n\n• Freezing the lottery odds at an earlier, specific date (hypothetically, All-Star weekend), so teams don't have a motivation to play poorly during the season's stretch run.\n\n• Limiting draft protections to 1-4 or lottery (top 14), eliminating what Utah and Washington are doing this season where they are working to protect top-eight protected picks.\n\n• Not allowing teams to pick in the top four in consecutive years.\n\n• Including all the play-in teams in the lottery.\n\n• Flattening the lottery odds so every team has the same chance.\n\nAll of those \"solutions\" would create new challenges. Freeze the lottery odds at the All-Star break and teams will start tanking earlier, in the heart of the season. Taking away teams' ability to pick in the top four in consecutive years takes a key team-building tool for smaller markets — it's how San Antonio got so good right now.\n\nEven Silver's owners are not all on the same page.\n\nMat Ishbia of the Suns said tanking was for losers.\n\nThis is ridiculous! Tanking is losing behavior done by losers. Purposely losing is something nobody should want to be associated with. Embarrassing for the league and for the organizations. And the talk about this as a “strategy” is ridiculous. \n\nIf you are a bad team, you get a… https://t.co/VoUx3YEdB5\n\n— Mat Ishbia (@Mishbia15) February 19, 2026\n\nMark Cuban said the NBA should embrace tanking.\n\nWhy the NBA should embrace tanking - \n\nThe NBA has kate been misguided thinking that fans want to see their teams compete every night with a chance to win. It’s never been that way that way. \n\nWhen I got into the nba, they thought they were in the basketball business. They…\n\n— Mark Cuban (@mcuban) February 17, 2026\n\nIn the end, there may be no solution because landing a high pick and getting a player such as Cade Cunningham, Anthony Edwards, Cooper Flagg or Victor Wembanyama (to name just the recent examples) changes the fortunes and value of a franchise. Teams are going to do what it takes to give themselves the best chance to win. Flatten the lottery odds and the league has to accept the risk that a good team — and if the pick was traded, maybe the league's best team — could end up with the No. 1 pick. Teams are trying to sell their fan base either on winning (\"we are contenders/very good right now, so come watch us\") or on hope for the future. Reduce the bad teams' lottery odds, and you reduce that hope.\n\nThere is no easy answer. But Silver is determined to do something.",

Rowe was the last fighter to weigh in and initially registered at 172 pounds, while Lebosnoyani came in at 170.5.\n\nHowever, Rowe was allowed a second attempt and on his next try he successfully hit the mark at 170.5 pounds.\n\nRowe had missed weight for two previous UFC bouts.

    "description": "John F. Kennedy Jr. and two others died in a 1999 plane crash near Martha's Vineyard. Here's what happened.",
    "fullText": "The Kennedy family has been subjected to many tragedies over the years, including two assassinations and a plane crash that took the lives of John F. Kennedy Jr. and two other passengers.\n\nNearly 27 years ago, on July 16, 1999, John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, and her older sister Lauren Bessette were killed in a plane crash off the coast of Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. There were no survivors from the accident.\n\nThe relationship between John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy is now the topic of an FX series executive-produced by Ryan Murphy, \"Love Story.\"\n\nTheir deaths became a major news story and perpetuated rumors of a \"Kennedy curse.\"\n\nJFK Jr.'s father, former President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963. His uncle, Robert \"Bobby\" Kennedy, was assassinated five years later in 1968. And two years before JFK Jr.'s death, his cousin Michael Kennedy also died after hitting a tree while skiing in Aspen, Colorado.\n\nHere's what we know about the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr. and two others.\n\nAs the son of a president and a member of one of America's most prominent political dynasties, John F. Kennedy Jr. was destined for the spotlight.\n\nJFK Jr. was born on November 25, 1960, just two weeks after his father was elected president. His father was assassinated on November 22, 1963, just three days shy of JFK Jr.'s third birthday.\n\nJFK Jr., affectionately nicknamed \"John-John\" by the public, attended the funeral on his birthday and was famously photographed saluting his father's casket.\n\nThroughout much of his adolescence and adulthood, he mostly remained out of the public eye.\n\nHowever, his public image began to change after he introduced his uncle, Ted Kennedy, at the Democratic National Convention in 1988.\n\nIn September 1988, People named Kennedy, who was then a 27-year-old third-year law student at NYU, the \"Sexiest Man Alive.\"\n\nJFK Jr. also dated a few celebrities throughout the 1990s, including \"Sex and the City\" star Sarah Jessica Parker, Cindy Crawford, and Daryl Hannah.\n\nThey met in the fitting room at Calvin Klein, where Bessette helped JFK Jr. pick out wardrobe items, Elizabeth Beller wrote in \"Once Upon a Time: The Captivating Life of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy,\" cited by People.\n\nTall, sophisticated, and beautiful, JFK Jr.'s new girlfriend captivated the public.\n\nAfter two years of dating, the pair married in an intimate ceremony on Cumberland Island, Georgia, People reported.\n\nThe media attention may have even inspired Kennedy to get his pilot's license in 1998.\n\n\"That was some of the happiest times he ever had. Floating around with the buzzards in his Buckeye [plane]. It was the freedom,\" his close friend Robbie Littell told \"JFK Jr: An Intimate Oral Biography\" author RoseMarie Terenzio, according to People.\n\n\"He said, 'It's the only place I can go where no one is bothering me. I have complete silence, and no one can get to me except the air traffic controllers.' Maybe that gives you insight into what he was really dealing with on the ground,\" his college friend Gary Ginsberg said, People reported.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Kennedy departed Essex County Airport near Fairfield, New Jersey, at around 8:38 p.m. on Friday, July 16, 1999. The sun was already beginning to set and \"hazy conditions,\" which had been reported earlier in the evening, were getting worse, People reported.\n\nKennedy planned to drop his sister-in-law Lauren Bessette on Martha's Vineyard before traveling to his family's compound in Hyannis Port with Carolyn. The couple was due to attend his cousin Rory Kennedy's wedding the following day, according to People.\n\nHowever, the plane never landed in Martha's Vineyard.\n\nAn unidentified driver reported the plane had failed to arrive at Martha's Vineyard Airport as expected, according to the Post, citing an NBC report. It kicked off a search for the missing aircraft in the early hours of July 17.\n\nThe debris field was identified off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, relatively near the estate once owned by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Kennedy's mother, The New York Times reported. (Kennedy Onassis died in 1994.)\n\nThe bodies of John F. Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, and Lauren Bessette were discovered by Navy divers on July 22, 1999, after an extensive search approved by President Bill Clinton.\n\nThe bodies of the crash victims, which were ''near and under'' the main body of the aircraft, were still strapped in, according to the Times.\n\nKennedy had only flown about 72 hours without a flight instructor, and had only about 300 total hours of flying experience, The New York Times reported in July 2000. He had reportedly rejected an offer to have a flight instructor accompany the group on their journey.\n\nAs a newly trained pilot, Kennedy was not licensed to fly and navigate the air using flying instruments. Instead, he had only trained to fly using sight alone, which would have been extremely difficult in dark or hazy conditions such as those on the night of July 16.\n\nWarren Morningstar, a spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, told the Times that \"flying at night over featureless terrain or water, and particularly in haze or in overcast, is a prime setup for spatial disorientation.\"\n\nAbout an hour into the trip, the plane's flight path became irregular as it began its descent into Martha's Vineyard, indicating that the pilot may have become disoriented by the darkness of the sky and the water, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded.\n\n\"His flight path into the water is consistent with what is known as a graveyard spiral,\" Jeff Guzzetti, an NTSB investigator in the accident, told Terenzio, according to People. \"The airplane makes a spiral nose down … kind of like going down a drain. The plane went into one final turn and it stayed in that turn pretty much all the way down to the ocean.\"\n\nThe Washington Post reported that the plane did not send out a distress call. Instead, it made its final descent and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in under 30 seconds.\n\nKennedy, Kennedy-Bessette, and Bessette's bodies were cremated and buried at sea off the coast of Martha's Vineyard on July 22, 1999.\n\n\"We are filled with unspeakable grief and sadness by the loss of John and Carolyn and Lauren Bessette,\" Ted Kennedy said in a statement on behalf of the Kennedy family. \"John was a shining light in all our lives and in the lives of the nation and the world that first came to know him as a little boy.\"\n\nThe extensive search captured the nation's attention, as did the tragedy of the three young passengers' deaths. Yet another tragic accident for the Kennedy family, the plane crash only added to rumors of a Kennedy family curse.\n\n\"I've looked high and low and cannot find another family since the ancient Greek House of Atreus that has suffered more calamities and misfortunes than the Kennedys,\" Edward Klein, the author of \"The Kennedy Curse: Why Tragedy Has Haunted America's First Family for 150 Years,\" said, according to The Washington Post.\n\nWhile there are many logical reasons for the fateful plane crash, it's nevertheless poignant that the Kennedy family, one of the wealthiest and most influential political families in the world, has suffered so much tragedy throughout the last 100 years.\n\n\"The humanity of their story is what keeps us engaged,\" Kennedy family biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli told NBC News in 2019.\n\n\"We peer behind the scenes of their wealthy lifestyle, and we see, for all the advantages they have, tragedy can still happen.\"",

    "fullText": "Two memory-product entrepreneurs have seen their fortunes rocket this year thanks to heady demand from AI giants.\n\nDavid Sun, 74, and John Tu, 84, are the cofounders and 50-50 owners of Kingston Technology, a leading maker of computer drives and memory modules. Sun is the California company's operating chief, while Tu is president and CEO.\n\nThe pair have seen their respective net worths soar by 44%, or nearly $14 billion, since the start of January, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows.\n\nOnly Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Czechoslovak Group CEO Michal Strnad, and Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim have gained more wealth so far this year.\n\nSun and Tu have even outpaced Jim, Alice, and Rob Walton; the heirs to the Walmart fortune were up about $13 billion each for the year at Thursday's close.\n\nThe memory magnates are both worth about $45 billion, putting them in 45th and 46th place respectively on the rich list — ahead of the likes of MacKenzie Scott, SoftBank's Masayoshi Son, and Miriam Adelson.\n\nSun and Tu were born in Taiwan and mainland China, respectively, studied electrical engineering in college, and emigrated to the US in the 1970s, per Bloomberg. They met in Los Angeles, where they bonded over basketball and went into business together.\n\nThe pair founded a memory-device company, Camintonn, in 1982, and sold it four years later for $6 million, Bloomberg says. They lost all their savings in the Black Monday crash of 1987, but went on to found Kingston and sell 80% of it to SoftBank for $1.5 billion in 1996. They bought back the stake for $450 million in 1999.\n\nAI hyperscalers have been clamoring for memory chips to build out data centers, fueling a severe global shortage that has driven prices skyward.\n\nThis \"memory supercycle\" promises to boost revenues and profits at memory-product companies, which has propelled their stock prices in recent months.\n\nFor example, Micron Technology stock has more than quadrupled over the past 12 months, valuing the memory-chip maker at $470 billion — more than Mastercard, Oracle, Costco, Bank of America, or Home Depot are worth.",

    "description": "Real GDP rose at an annualized rate of 1.4% in the fourth quarter, missing the expected 2.8%.",
    "fullText": "Economic growth slowed more than expected at the end of last year — and a shutdown-fueled drop in government spending was a major culprit.\n\nUS real gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of 1.4% in the fourth quarter, short of the 2.8% expected.\n\nThat's also subpar compared to the 4.4% growth in the third quarter, which was propped up by robust consumer spending and exports. Still, it means the economy wrapped up the year with some strength in a year filled with uncertainty and many policy changes.\n\nEconomic growth likely would have looked better without the record-long government shutdown in the fall.\n\n\"On paper, 1.4% looks weak,\" Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, said. \"If you strip away the shutdown drag which shaved roughly 1 to 1.5 percentage points off the top line, we are looking at an economy that would have otherwise hummed along near its full year average of 2.2%.\"\n\n\"The contributors to the increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter were increases in consumer spending and investment,\" the Bureau of Economic Analysis said. \"These movements were partly offset by decreases in government spending and exports.\"\n\nConsumer spending slowed to 2.4% in the fourth quarter from 3.5% in the third quarter. Meanwhile, fixed investment was stronger than in the previous quarter, rising 2.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 0.8% in the third. Federal spending fell 16.6% in the fourth quarter after rising 2.7% in the third, likely due to the government shutdown in October and November.\n\nThat big drop in government spending and investment dragged overall GDP growth down:\n\nOverall, real GDP rose 2.2% last year, short of the 2.8% a year prior. BEA said the increase in 2025 was mainly due to consumer spending and investment.\n\n\"We expect a strong year of economic growth in 2026, driven by business investment, consumer spending and fading trade headwinds,\" said Rick Gardner, chief investment officer of RGA Investments.\n\nOther recent data releases showed how the economy ended 2025 and began 2026. The job market has been losing strength over the past few years, and in 2025, it added the fewest jobs in over two decades outside recessions. However, the job market had a good start to 2026, with unemployment cooling and more jobs added than expected.\n\nMeanwhile, inflation has gotten closer to the Fed's 2% target. The consumer price index, one inflation measure, rose 2.4% year over year in January, softer than the previous 2.7%. Advance estimates of retail and food services sales showed sales were pretty flat in December from November's sales, but better than a year ago.",

    "fullText": "Roseanne Barr's son, Jake Pentland, told Us Weekly in June 2025 that his famous mother had traded the Hollywood Hills for Texas Hill Country, a region in central Texas that includes cities like Austin and New Braunfels.\n\n\"My mom lives with me, my wife, and my two daughters — she's the best grandma,\" Pentland told the magazine.\n\nIn a separate June interview with Fox News Digital, Barr said living in Texas is a \"dream come true\" and described what her new life looks like.\n\n\"I'm doing a lot of mowing. I've got a really fantastic tractor out here, and I'm mowing,\" Barr said. \"The only problem is I don't clear the trees quite as good as I should, and I'm always hitting a tree and knocking it over, and it always hits me in the head.\"\n\nA native of Texas, Duff decided with her fiancé Matt Rosenberg to pack up the kids and leave California once the pandemic hit.\n\nAt first, she was nervous that the move would hurt her career.\n\n\"I think so much of my fear of moving out of Los Angeles was that my career was there and that I would never work again or something like that,\" she told Fox News Digital in 2022. \"And, you know, I think this has all taught us that Zoom certainly can be a very powerful tool. And we can, you know, very luckily for me, get to continue to work from here, and I get to live near my dad. I haven't lived, here, near my dad in a really long time.\"\n\nThe son of Clint Eastwood, Scott has been methodically building his own career, showing up in the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise and Guy Ritchie movies.\n\nDuring his downtime in Texas, he does everything from fishing to hunting.\n\n\"I think that's why people who come to Texas really can fall in love with it,\" he told Flaunt in 2021 from his home in Austin. \"There's more community, people are more neighborly, people are nice. It slows life down a little bit. It's not this fast-paced living in a big city like New York or Los Angeles.\"\n\nAfter spending most of her life jet-setting around the world trying to conquer the modeling industry, Hadid decided recently to take some time away from the spotlight.\n\nIn early 2024, she spoke to Allure about moving to Texas to focus on her mental and physical health (she was diagnosed with Lyme Disease in 2013), and be with her cowboy boyfriend Adan Banuelos.\n\n\"Just as I have styled myself for years now — which I still do — I love being able to do my own hair and makeup, be happy with how I look, and get ready with my girlfriends here in Texas,\" Hadid told Allure. \"We have the best time, and I never feel like I need to do too much.\"\n\n\"For the first time now, I'm not putting on a fake face. If I don't feel good, I won't go. If I don't feel good, I take time for myself. And I've never had the opportunity to do that or say that before,\" Hadid added. \"Now when anybody sees me in pictures and they say I look happy, I genuinely am. I am feeling better; my bad days now were my old good days.\"\n\nHarrelson lived in Hawaii for many years before moving back to his home state of Texas in 2023.\n\nNow in the Lone Star State and living just outside Austin, the actor has lobbied alongside longtime friend Matthew McConaughey to make Texas a hub for film and television production.\n\nIn 2025, the Texas House approved Senate Bill 22, which provides $300 million every two years through 2035 to support the local film industry.\n\nIn 2021, the rapper-turned-television producer and entrepreneur announced on X that he was living in Houston.\n\nThe star has enjoyed visiting Austin for decades but finally decided to live there in 2020.\n\n\"I love it. I've been coming here for 20 years,\" he told \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\" in 2020. \"I'm much closer to my mom and everybody. I love it. It's great.\"\n\nThe former mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter turned TikTok food critic has set up shop in Texas.\n\nAfter living in Las Vegas, Lee relocated to Texas in November 2024. In a December video reviewing the downtown Dallas restaurant The Wicked Butcher, he revealed that he now lives in Dallas.\n\n\"One thing I do love about the Dallas food scene — we've been here a month, a month and a half — they do have some nice fine dining restaurants,\" Lee said.\n\nOscar-winner Matthew McConaughey and wife Camila Alves settled in Austin in 2012 after buying a 10,800-square-foot mansion.\n\nAccording to a 2024 profile in Southern Living, the move to Texas was initially because of a \"family crisis,\" when he needed to help his mother and two brothers. The couple decided to stay put and raise their three children there.\n\n\"Ritual came back,\" McConaughey said of being back in Texas. \"Whether that was Sunday church, sports, dinner together as a family every night, or staying up after that telling stories in the kitchen, sitting at the island pouring drinks and nibbling while retelling them all in different ways than we told them before.\"\n\nIn July, Elon Musk vowed to move two of his companies, X and SpaceX, out of California and into Texas. He already moved Telsa to Texas in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, Musk announced that he had already moved to Texas himself at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council summit.\n\nMusk has claimed to own a tiny home in Texas, and records show he bought a house in Austin in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, O'Neal bought a 5,269-square-foot home in Carrollton listed at $1,224,000 and sold it in 2024 for an undisclosed amount, though it was listed for $1.7 million, according to Realtor.com.\n\nThat year, Chexy Trust, tied to the Carrollton purchase, bought a 4,670-square-foot home in Rockwall County. In 2024, O'Neal opened a branch of his Big Chicken chain restaurant in Fort Worth.\n\nAs his footprint in the region grows, he told WFAA he plans to make the area his home base.\n\n\"I'm 75% going to move here full time,\" O'Neal said in June. \"I have to see what's going on with TNT next year, but based on that, you'll probably be seeing a lot more of me.\"\n\nThe \"Twisters\" star, who is also a native Texan, moved back to Austin from Los Angeles recently to be close to his family and for his own mental health.\n\n\"When all you do is consume movies and entertainment, you could become a little self-aware and maybe derivative of yourself,\" Powell told USA Today. \"Your personal life, there's no sort of freedom there, there's storytelling around that, and I feel like that's just not good for you on the long term.\"\n\nPadalecki ditched Hollywood for Texas before it was a trend. The \"Supernatural\" star, a San Antonio native, relocated from Los Angeles to Austin with his wife, Genevieve, in 2012.\n\nIn an Instagram video taken on Austin's 24th Street in 2020, he explained why he loves the city so much.\n\n\"Austin brings me a warmth and a happiness and a peace that I have been unable to find anywhere else in my travels,\" Padalecki said. \"I love being here.\"\n\nIn 2025, former \"Selling Sunset\" star Christine Quinn relocated to her home state of Texas after splitting from her ex-husband, tech entrepreneur Christian Dumontet.\n\nQuinn now lives in a suburb outside Dallas with her young son, Christian.\n\n\"I am really, really grateful to be living here,\" Quinn told People in January, adding that she's happy to be closer to family. \"I have a sister who lives really close to me, and my son has a cousin. So it's really something that I needed as opposed to the chaos when I was in Los Angeles.\"\n\nLike many other celebs, Rogan left Los Angeles once the pandemic hit.\n\nIn a 2023 episode of his popular podcast, \"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" he explained why he ended up in Texas.\n\n\"Then we went to the lake, and people are playing music and jumping in the water,\" said Rogan, adding that his kids \"were like, 'We want to live here!'\"\n\n\"That was it. Two months later, I lived here,\" he said in the podcast episode.\n\n\"The Sopranos\" star moved to Austin in 2021 with her family, husband Cutter Dykstra, and sons Beau and Jack.\n\n\"I almost feel more connected to my craft and why I love acting,\" Sigler told The New York Times in 2021. \"When the calls come in, it's a beautiful surprise. I'm still on things and I'm still a businesswoman and it's still my career, but I don't feel the pressure around it because we took a stand for ourselves and we made decisions for our families.\"",

    "description": "Jared Isaacman critiqued engineering issues, but said leadership and decision-making was the \"most troubling failure\" of the Boeing Starliner debacle.",
    "fullText": "The head of NASA sent a scathing letter to employees on Thursday, outlining the failures of the botched Boeing Starliner mission that left a pair of astronauts stuck in space.\n\nJared Isaacman slammed \"design and engineering deficiencies\" but said the \"most troubling failure\" was decision-making and leadership.\n\n\"If left unchecked, [it] could create a culture incompatible with human spaceflight,\" he added.\n\nThe mission took place in June 2024, flying two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station. However, helium leaks saw Starliner's thrusters malfunction. The mission was supposed to last eight days, but the pair ultimately spent over 90 days in space before returning to Earth on a SpaceX flight.\n\n\"We returned the crew safely, but the path we took did not reflect NASA at its best,\" Isaacman told staff.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the incident was formally designated as a \"Type A mishap\" — the most severe level, on par with the Columbia and Challenger Space Shuttle disasters.\n\nNASA defines such mishaps as those causing more than $2 million in failure costs, the loss of a vehicle or its control, or deaths.\n\nHowever, a mishap was not initially declared for Starliner, despite a loss of control and, according to Isaacman, \"cost thresholds exceeding a Type A mishap by a factor of one hundred,\" implying a loss of at least $200 million.\n\nThis decision was influenced by \"concern for the Starliner program's reputation,\" he added.\n\nIsaacman's letter wasn't entirely gloomy.\n\nHe praised the \"extraordinary professionalism\" of controllers and crew who recovered control of the spacecraft and achieved docking with the International Space Station.\n\n\"At that moment, had different decisions been made, had thrusters not been recovered, or had docking been unsuccessful, the outcome of this mission could have been very different,\" he added.\n\nThe letter coincided with the publication of the report into the Starliner mission. It's over 300 pages long and details the engineering and cultural problems.\n\nInvestigators said there were \"times of unprofessional behavior\" as NASA and Boeing butted heads on how to bring the astronauts home.\n\n\"There was yelling in meetings,\" one interviewee said. \"It was emotionally charged and unproductive.\" Another said they heard safety engineers being berated \"off muted mics.\"\n\n\"It was probably the ugliest environment that I've been in,\" said another.\n\nThe report listed three root causes for the debacle.\n\nFirstly, it said NASA had a \"hands-off approach\" to setting up the contract, leading to insufficient oversight of Boeing's design and testing.\n\nThen, Boeing didn't verify the propulsion system across all environments and use cases during the design phase, leaving Starliner exposed to conditions for which it wasn't properly certified, the report said.\n\nLastly, it said the culture at NASA's Commercial Crew Program led to greater acceptance of technical risk and a reluctance to fully challenge Boeing's analyses.\n\nIsaacman said that NASA will continue working with Boeing.\n\n\"But to be clear: NASA will not fly another crew on Starliner until technical causes are understood and corrected, the propulsion system is fully qualified, and appropriate investigation recommendations are implemented,\" he added.\n\nIn a statement, Boeing said it was \"grateful\" to NASA for its \"thorough investigation.\"\n\n\"In the 18 months since our test flight, Boeing has made substantial progress on corrective actions for technical challenges we encountered and driven significant cultural changes across the team that directly align with the findings in the report.\"",

    "fullText": "The World War II submarine USS Lionfish was part of America's \"Silent Service.\"\n\nDespite comprising less than 2% of all US Navy vessels during World War II, submarines like the USS Lionfish sank 55% of Japanese vessels in battle.\n\nThis once-fearsome vessel is now a 311-foot-long museum exhibit, allowing the public to learn about its top-secret wartime operations.\n\nTake a look inside the USS Lionfish.\n\nOver the Balao-class submarine's two war patrols, she sank a Japanese submarine, destroyed a schooner, and rescued the crew of a downed American B-29 bomber.\n\nThe USS Lionfish was recommissioned for the Korean War, serving from 1951 to 1953.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1971, the USS Lionfish served as a reserve training submarine, teaching crew members to operate similar vessels.\n\nTickets to Battleship Cove cost $25 per adult. I visited the museum in January to take a closer look at the retired submarine.\n\nThe forward torpedo room featured six torpedo tubes, each storing a torpedo, and 10 reloads. The 16 crew members slept alongside the torpedoes on pull-out bunks, remaining ready to fire at all times.\n\nIn the officers' pantry, meals for the higher-ranking crew members were reheated and plated on Navy china. They ate the same food as the rest of the sailors, but in a fancier setting.\n\nIt could also serve as an operating room in medical emergencies.\n\nOfficers enjoyed more privacy on board than enlisted men.\n\nThe commanding officer's stateroom featured a small desk that functioned as a private workspace.\n\nChief petty officers served as liaisons between the officers and the crew. This room was also colloquially known as the \"goat locker\" since the more experienced officers were affectionately nicknamed \"old goats.\"\n\nPersonnel files, orders of supplies, and other administrative tasks were the yeoman's domain.\n\nThe commanding officer issued orders from the control center or the conning tower located directly above. The USS Lionfish's conning tower wasn't open to the public, but I did get to look inside one while touring another Balao-class submarine, the USS Becuna.\n\nThe USS Lionfish was equipped with sonar, or \"sound navigation and ranging,\" to listen for enemy ships in the surrounding waters.\n\nThe galley prepared four meals a day: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and midnight rations known as \"mid-rats.\"\n\nFrozen and refrigerated food was stored in compartments underneath the floor.\n\nOther Balao-class submarines held 35 or 36 bunks in this space.\n\nEach engine room was responsible for half of the ship's electric and propulsion power.\n\nWhile surfaced, the submarine's four diesel engines powered its generators, which in turn powered the ship's motors. While submerged, storage batteries powered the motors.\n\nAround 13 enlisted men worked and slept in the after torpedo room, which featured four torpedo tubes.\n\nOver 50 submarines underwent a Greater Underwater Propulsive Power 1-A, or \"GUPPY,\" modernization after World War II. However, the USS Lionfish remained as it was.\n\nMuseum staff and volunteers are working to restore the USS Lionfish and preserve its original configuration. Even in frigid temperatures, I saw volunteers holding tools and walking carefully around the deck's open panels, revealing the complex mechanics beneath.",

    "description": "The former prince's arrest may well mark the start of a deep and painful reckoning.",
    "fullText": "This story originally ran in Die Welt and appears on Business Insider through the Axel Springer Global Reporters Network.\n\nPrince Andrew's 66th birthday began in a somber atmosphere — with the arrival of six unmarked police vehicles and eight plainclothes officers who searched his home, Wood Farm, on the royal Sandringham estate in Norfolk, and with news that a warrant had been issued for the king's younger brother on suspicion of serious abuse of office.\n\nThe British public is still adjusting to calling him simply Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor after King Charles III stripped him of the rest of his titles and honors. For the royal \"Firm,\" seeking to redefine itself after the long reign of Elizabeth II, he has become a liability.\n\nAndrew, once said to have been Queen Elizabeth's favorite child, has spent years fending off questions about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and whether he was involved in Epstein's trafficking of underage girls and women. Epstein's associate, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell — herself a close confidant of Andrew — was convicted of sex trafficking after his 2019 death in jail.\n\nThe latest release of the Epstein files has opened a Pandora's box and dramatically intensified what the palace long referred to as \"the Andrew problem.\" The allegations of abuse of office likely relate to correspondence indicating that Andrew divulged confidential information obtained during overseas trade missions.\n\nDocuments released by the US Department of Justice last month also show that in 2010, the prince's liaison shared with Epstein details about restructuring plans at the Royal Bank of Scotland — which had been bailed out with taxpayer funds after the financial crisis — and internal management issues at luxury carmaker Aston Martin.\n\nIn a life that, after his early years in the Royal Navy, appeared to lack a clearly defined purpose, Andrew's most significant official role was that of Britain's trade and investment envoy. He was tasked with promoting British economic interests in the Middle East and Asia — a kind of royal \"shop window\" for a country reliant on foreign investment and willing to dispatch a spare prince around the globe to attract it.\n\nThe boundary between that role and Andrew's party-filled lifestyle was often blurred; his reputation as a flamboyant bon vivant (\"Randy Andy\") followed him persistently.\n\nEpstein, who wanted access to influential figures in London, offered Andrew female companionship. In one 2013 email in the files, Epstein wrote: \"I have a very pretty friend coming to London on Tuesday. Andrew might like to take her to dinner.\" Photographs from the Epstein files show Andrew bent over a young woman on a carpet.\n\nThe difficulties facing Mountbatten-Windsor and the royal family now extend beyond such unsavory dealings to concrete criminal allegations. On Thursday, the king issued a statement emphasizing that the days of quiet fraternal backing were over. He welcomed a \"full, fair and proper process\" with the palace's \"unrestricted support and cooperation.\"\n\nOne fact is already beyond dispute: For someone raised within the royal family to value discretion above all else, Andrew's apparent recklessness is striking. The emails show he forwarded government travel reports from visits to Vietnam, Singapore, and China to Epstein.\n\nMost serious of all remains the accusation by Virginia Giuffre, one of the women who says she was recruited and sexually exploited by Epstein and Maxwell and who took her own life last April after years of psychological distress. She alleged that Andrew had sex with her in London in 2001 when she was 17 — around the same time the now widely circulated photograph was taken, showing Andrew with his arm around her in Maxwell's apartment.\n\nAndrew has repeatedly denied having sexual contact with Giuffre; he reached an out-of-court settlement with her in a civil case, reportedly involving a multimillion-pound payment. Andrew admitted no liability and has argued that Queen Elizabeth and her closest advisors pressed for the settlement in order to resolve the matter during the final years of the queen's life.\n\nThe settlement money — described in UK press reports as a \"loan\" from the royal household to Andrew — in retrospect appears to have been paid in the hope that a sensitive matter would thereby be put to rest.\n\nThis raises uncomfortable questions for today's monarchy, which now issues statements and expresses sympathy for Epstein's victims. The so-called \"Fab Four,\" representing the monarchy in a time of national and international upheaval — King Charles and Queen Camilla, along with the Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Catherine — are said to agree on maintaining clear professional and personal distance from Andrew.\n\nParticular irritation has reportedly been caused by indications in the files that visits by Epstein and by women he intended to introduce to Andrew \"privately\" were planned at royal residences without security vetting.\n\nThe removal of all Andrew's royal titles and patronages after lengthy negotiations with Charles — and his relocation to a more modest residence on the Sandringham estate — was a clear signal that the days when he could count on his brother's support were over.\n\nYet questions remain as to how the drama was allowed to spiral so far out of control — and why decisive action was so long delayed, even as Andrew became increasingly uncooperative over the years.\n\nOne possible answer is that the monarchy is a strategically minded institution. As a centuries-old system, it has survived upheavals ranging from the abdication crisis of the 1930s to the estrangement and death of Princess Diana.\n\nWithin palace circles, there appears to be a belief that a largely monarchist British public will accept that the royal family, too, is a complex entity, with problematic members navigating the tension between personal loyalty and public expectation.\n\nYet this affair and its emerging legal consequences illustrate how difficult it is for a system built on lineage and rigid hierarchy to find a meaningful role for spare heirs.\n\nFormally, Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne — birth dates cannot be altered, nor the succession changed without an act of Parliament — but in practice, he is an outcast. The Andrew problem, however, no longer concerns him alone. His arrest may well mark only the beginning of a deeper and more painful reckoning.\n\nAnne McElvoy is a member of the Axel Springer Global Reporters Network and executive editor at Politico UK.",

    "description": "Here are some of the most unusual Winter Olympic sports in history, from ski ballet and military patrol to dog sled racing and skijoring.",
    "fullText": "The Milan Cortina Winter Olympics are well underway, and it might be the most that most people will hear about curling or bobsled, at least for the next four years.\n\nFor many viewers, the 2026 Olympic Games have showcased just how peculiar some winter sports can be, from the flight of ski jumping to the rigor of ski mountaineering, a new event this year.\n\nAs unfamiliar as the current lineup of winter Olympic sports might be for some, Olympic Games history reveals even more unusual showcases, like skiers riding behind horses or performing their ballet moves on the snow.\n\nPrior to the 1992 Games, the events featured what were known as \"demonstration events\" where athletes showed off their abilities in a discipline without being awarded official Olympic medals — often to celebrate regionally popular sports in the host country or to test the appeal of more experimental disciplines.\n\nThese eight sports were among the most unusual demonstrations ever held at the Winter Olympics, with some serving as official medal events while others remained only as demonstration sports.\n\nYears: 1924 as an official medal event; 1928, 1936, and 1948 as a demonstration sport.\n\nMilitary patrol combined cross-country skiing with rifle shooting in a team event modeled after alpine military exercises.\n\nFour-man units, typically active-duty soldiers from each country, skied long distances over mountainous terrain, stopping periodically for rifle shooting tests that could add time penalties.\n\nAs the Games moved toward standardized international competition, military patrol was gradually refined into the modern biathlon sport, which debuted as an official Olympic sport in 1960.\n\nYears: 1948, as an official medal event\n\nIntroduced at the 1948 St. Moritz Games, the winter pentathlon combined five disciplines: cross-country skiing, downhill skiing, shooting, fencing, and horse riding.\n\nThe format mirrored the modern pentathlon's test of versatility, and asked athletes to demonstrate endurance, speed, precision, and tactical skill across snow and ice.\n\nThe event attracted limited international participation and was never held again.\n\nYears: 1988 and 1992 as a demonstration sport\n\nSki ballet, later known as acroski, featured choreographed routines performed on gentle slopes to music, blending spins, jumps, and intricate footwork.\n\nJudges scored athletes on technical precision and artistic expression, much as in figure skating.\n\nWhile moguls and aerials — which were other disciplines within the broader freestyle skiing category — evolved into medal sports, ski ballet was dropped after 1992.\n\nYears: 1992 as a demonstration sport\n\nSpeed skiing was a pure test of velocity on snow showcased at the 1992 Albertville Games, with athletes descending a steep, straight course in a tight aerodynamic tuck while reaching speeds of up to 130 mph.\n\nConcerns about safety, along with its narrow competitive format compared with other alpine disciplines, kept it from becoming a permanent Olympic event.\n\nYears: 1928 as a demonstration sport\n\nUnlike modern versions that use harnessed riders, the Olympic exhibition of skijoring at the 1928 St. Moritz Games involved a mounted jockey guiding galloping horses across a frozen lake while a skier held on behind.\n\nThe spectacle, which reflected Alpine winter traditions, drew large crowds, but the sport was seen as more of a novelty exhibition than a standardized international competition and was never added to the official program.\n\nYears: 1932 as a demonstration sport\n\nDog sled racing debuted as a demonstration event at the 1932 Lake Placid Games. The event showcased teams of sled dogs pulling mushers over snowy endurance courses.\n\nIts inclusion highlighted winter culture in the host region, but limited international participation at the time kept it from gaining full Olympic status.\n\nYears: 1952 as a demonstration sport\n\nBandy is a hockey-like team sport played on a large ice field roughly the size of a soccer pitch. Players use curved sticks to move a ball rather than a puck.\n\nOriginating in northern Europe, it predates modern ice hockey and emphasizes passing and field positioning.\n\nThe sport was showcased at the 1952 Oslo Games, although its strong regional concentration, particularly in Scandinavia and parts of the Soviet Union, limited its expansion into a full Olympic event.\n\nYears: 1936 and 1964 as a demonstration sport\n\nIce stock sport, often compared to curling, involves sliding heavy stocks across ice toward a target with the aim of precision placement.\n\nThe sport is popular in Alpine countries such as Austria and Germany, and it was featured twice at the Olympics as a demonstration event.\n\nIts close resemblance to curling and concentrated geographic relevance prevented it from being added permanently to the Olympic lineup.",

    "description": "After years of riding trains across the US, I've seen my share of annoying passengers who make mistakes because they don't know basic train etiquette.",
    "fullText": "Train travel can be an adventure.\n\nWhizzing by different terrain and meeting new people are all part of the trip. However, a ride can also be frustrating or a bit chaotic, especially if other passengers are doing things that irritate you.\n\nAfter more than 26 years of riding trains up and down both US coasts and across the Midwest, here are seven things I wish passengers would stop doing.\n\nAs is the case on most public transportation, you risk encountering talkative seatmates on trains.\n\nBeing stuck in a conversation for a multihour train ride can be exhausting, especially since many people choose this form of transit because it's considered a leisurely and relaxing travel option.\n\nI don't usually mind having brief conversations with people near me — it's a shared experience after all — but not everyone wants to be social.\n\nWhen it comes to chatting on board, consent from both parties is key.\n\nSimilar to air travel, trains have limited space in front of the seats and in the overhead bins. Try to stick to your fair share of luggage, or plan in advance to check it when you board.\n\nOn Amtrak, most reservations allow you to bring one bag and two carry-on items. You may be able to bring more if you book a private car or upgrade your ticket.\n\nPeople are getting on and off at every stop, so even if your train car looks empty when you board, you should still be mindful of how much space you're taking up.\n\nSpeaking of taking up too much space: Spreading all your things across a row or more of seats is annoying for fellow passengers.\n\nSince there isn't much extra space on trains, I wish people were more mindful about taking too many seats, blocking the middle aisle, and knocking into the people around them when they need to unpack something or resituate their luggage.\n\nThis also goes for lying down across multiple seats. If you need to stretch out, go to the café car or observation space, where there's usually a little more room to move around.\n\nA lot of people think they don't have to clean up after themselves on trains and planes.\n\nIt's especially annoying because there are trash receptacles throughout the train, making it easy to organize your space as you go. I usually find them near stairwells, in restrooms, in the dining car, or at the end of the passenger cars.\n\nYour trash is your responsibility — the same goes for anything you spill during the trip.\n\nDon't stand in the way of people in the space between cars or on the narrow, sometimes winding, stairwells.\n\nSpace is limited, and if you trap someone for too long, they may start to feel unsafe or uncomfortable.\n\nIt's sometimes unavoidable to momentarily block people as they get on and off the train, but otherwise, be mindful and stay aware of your surroundings.\n\nWhen you're in a public place that's not a pool or spa, taking your shoes off probably won't elicit a pleasant reaction.\n\nThis is especially true when you're trapped in what's essentially a metal tube for hours.\n\nKeep your shoes on to avoid bothering your fellow train riders. I personally wouldn't want my feet touching the floor of a train anyway.\n\nIf you want to avoid irritating everyone around you, reduce your noise pollution.\n\nYou might be fascinated by the cooking video you found on YouTube, but the rest of the passengers probably aren't. And no matter how amazing your taste in music is, use headphones while on the train.\n\nThis also applies to phone calls — no one wants to hear your whole conversation on speakerphone.\n\nThis story was originally published on November 10, 2024, and most recently updated on February 20, 2025.",

    "description": "A founder explains how turning a personal needlepoint hobby into a modern brand led to over $10 million in sales and long-term growth.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Krista LeRay, founder and CEO of Penny Linn Designs. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy first needlepoint project was in college. I moved from the Chicago suburbs to the University of Kentucky for college and remember feeling struck by how preppy everything was. Everyone had these needlepoint belts that they would wear. I wanted to immerse myself in the culture, so I decided to try needlepoint.\n\nA local needlepoint store showed me how to do the basic continental stitch, and that was that. I stitched in college but then didn't think about it for a while, until my then-boyfriend (now husband) started talking about a needlepoint belt, and I said I could make him one.\n\nThen I stitched a ringbearer pillow for our wedding in 2019, and really fell back in love with the hobby. But I couldn't find the things I wanted to stitch in stores. It all felt older to me, so when the pandemic hit in 2020, and I had extra time on my hands, I started painting my own canvases. Since then, I've grown Penny Linn Designs to over 10 million in sales.\n\nI worked for Major League Baseball after graduating from college in 2013, but also ran a successful blog on the side. Eventually, I started making more money from my blog than at my corporate job, and I began blogging full-time.\n\nI shared the canvas I painted with my followers. It was the green Ralph's Coffee cup. My followers started asking me if I could paint a canvas for them to stitch, and that's what led me down the path to starting Penny Linn.\n\nThings just sort of snowballed. By 2022, I was making as much as I was making from my blog, making needlepoint canvases. When I had my first son that year, I had been blogging for 10 years and had sort of hit my max with sharing my life online. It felt like a natural progression to turn my full attention to Penny Linn.\n\nThroughout my blogging experience, I dealt with a lot of negative comments and cattiness. It helped me build a thick skin, something that is definitely needed when running a business.\n\nI have a 24-hour rule about dealing with criticism. I try not to read things about myself online, but if I do, I always ask whether the comment is valid. If it's not, I can push the critique aside.\n\nIf it is, I give myself 24 hours to be upset about it. After that, I either move on or decide to make a change.\n\nI only want to invest in things I'm good at and feel confident in. It's tough, but you have to decide what you're standing firm on when you grow a business. For me, that means that Penny Linn doesn't offer finishing services for our needlepoint projects.\n\nI don't want to provide a product that isn't up to my standards, and right now I don't believe we're good enough to get there. That makes some people mad, but I know it's right for us.\n\nOne of the other things I do is hire people who are smarter than me for my team. I know I don't know everything, so I look to others to help guide me on things like accounting and legal issues.\n\nI always say that Penny Linn is for a stitcher by a stitcher. I'm the stitcher that I'm talking about. Everything we sell is something I'd want to make. For now, that means mainly smaller canvases.\n\nA lot of people coming to Penny Linn are needlepoint beginners, so the projects are easier to manage and less expensive than larger projects like Christmas stockings. As our customers continue to grow with us, we'll start offering bigger projects.\n\nNeedlepoint is a popular hobby now, and I definitely worry about whether its popularity will continue. But I always remind myself that things like embroidery and needlepoint have been around since the dawn of time. Once you're a needlepointer, you're one for life. I think people will always come back to it, and we'll continue to evolve.",

    "description": "As an American, living in Paris for almost a decade has come with many surprises about French culture, fashion, healthcare, and smoking habits.",
    "fullText": "Shortly after I turned 25, I asked myself: \"If you could live anywhere, where would it be?\" The answer was always Paris.\n\nGrowing up in the US, I'd taken French classes from sixth grade through college. The language and the culture were always on my radar, so I decided to take the leap.\n\nEt voilà! About nine years later, I still live in Paris full-time. Here are a few things that have surprised me about life in the French capital over the years.\n\nIn Paris, I rarely cross paths with people wearing sweatpants or leggings in public, which is a stark contrast to my experience in the US.\n\nMost people in the French capital seem to put effort into their appearances and dress one step above what I'd consider casual in the US, even if they're making a quick run to the grocery store.\n\nI see a lot of tailored trousers paired with plain sweaters and scarves. People also dress up jeans with loafers or crisp white sneakers and tailored jackets.\n\nIn the US, I had three fashion modes: going-out clothes (crop tops, jeans, and heels), athleisure (leggings, colored sneakers, and tank tops), and office attire (slacks, loafers, and silky blouses).\n\nOn Saturdays, I was dressed for either the bars or the gym. There was really no in-between.\n\nLiving here has improved my sense of style and helped me take pride in how I present myself. My new, simplified wardrobe consists of smart, simple pieces I can wear during the day and in the evening.\n\nI've developed a uniform of sorts, mixing trousers, jeans, white sneakers, silk maxi skirts, plain T-shirts, tailored jackets, and lots of black pieces.\n\nGetting dressed is easier with a capsule wardrobe — I feel ready for anything when I leave the house.\n\nWhen I was living stateside, it seemed I was always asked where I worked out, not whether I worked out. And I'd regularly go to the gym first thing in the morning.\n\nThough new gyms and studios have cropped up in Paris in recent years, the fitness scene doesn't feel nearly as prominent here as it does in the US.\n\nI joined a gym when I arrived purely out of habit, but I've since changed my routine. Lately, I go on a leisurely jog along the Seine a few times a week instead.\n\nMany Parisians I know walk a ton and lead active lifestyles, even if they aren't in the weight room at 6 a.m. Although I'm exercising less here in Paris, I've never felt healthier.\n\nThe first time I went to lunch with my colleagues in Paris, we stayed at the restaurant from noon until 2 p.m. Everyone ordered a three-course meal that included appetizers, entrées, desserts, and coffee.\n\nIn the US, I got used to grabbing a quick salad and inhaling it at my desk while working, so I had to adjust to this slower pace.\n\nI quickly learned that long lunches filled with conversation are very common in Paris.\n\nAs much as I appreciate this mindset, I'm not a big lunch person. So, I've started declining invites to avoid being stuck for hours at a time.\n\nBaguettes are a way of life here. Bread is a component of almost every meal and is meant to be eaten with the main courses, not beforehand as an appetizer as it is in the US.\n\nMost baguettes in France contain just flour, water, yeast, and salt. There are no preservatives, meaning they can go stale in a short amount of time. It's not uncommon for people in Paris to buy a fresh baguette every day.\n\nWith boulangeries selling them for less than 2 euros a pop, who can blame them?\n\nThe legal drinking age in France is 18, which could play into the mindset I've noticed surrounding alcohol here.\n\nDrinking is part of France's culture, and based on what I've seen, the focus isn't on getting drunk the way it can be in the US, where people can't legally purchase or consume alcohol until they're 21. Here, it's about socialization.\n\nOf course, I've seen my fair share of locals overdo it since moving to Paris (and people's drinking habits vary the same way they do around the world), but jungle-juice parties, drinking games, and vodka-soaked watermelons don't seem to be as popular among people in their 20s here.\n\nInebriation feels like a byproduct of drinking in Paris rather than its purpose.\n\nThe first time I picked up a prescription in Paris, the pharmacist took a pen and wrote instructions on the box herself. I thought I was on an episode of \"Punk'd.\"\n\nMy name and information weren't included on the box, and the only way I knew how much to take was by reading her handwritten cursive, which was in French and somewhat hard to read.\n\nIn the US, pill boxes tend to have all the relevant information — such as the patient's name, birth date, and dosage instructions — printed in giant letters.\n\nBefore I moved to Paris, I was aware of the stereotype that French people are big smokers. I half expected it to be false (as so many clichés are), so I was surprised to find that cigarettes are actually very common here.\n\nWalk down a busy street in Paris around noon, and you will pass dozens of Parisians smoking before lunch. Grab a seat at a café, and you will find an ashtray on the table. Have a drink with a friend on a terrace, and you may sit directly next to someone ready to pull out a cigarette.\n\nSmoking is prohibited in enclosed public places, workplaces, and public parks, so I didn't expect so many nightclubs to have designated-smoking rooms inside. I've also noticed that it's completely normal for people to light up at crowded concerts.\n\nI've seen plenty of locals smoke inside at house parties in Paris (usually by a window or in a bathroom, to be fair), which I rarely, if ever, saw happen in the US.\n\nThe smoking here put me off in the beginning — partly because I have asthma — but after several years in Paris, it doesn't bother me as much anymore.\n\nThe most surprising thing about moving to Paris was the realization that healthcare costs significantly less here than it does in the US, where steep copays and premiums are par for the course.\n\nOf course, I knew about France's healthcare system before I relocated, but it was something altogether different to experience it firsthand.\n\nThe US has a mixed healthcare system that doesn't provide universal coverage, so it was quite a change to see France's social security, a government-funded healthcare system, cover every person who permanently resides in the country.\n\nEveryone in France contributes to social security, so it isn't free, but the healthcare system reimburses most medical costs.\n\nSince moving to Paris, I've rarely paid out of pocket for doctor visits and medications. If I wanted to, I could also enroll in supplemental health insurance provided by private companies, which some people in France do.\n\nI got sick in the winter of 2017 and begrudgingly went to the emergency room in Paris because I was having trouble breathing. If I were in the US, I probably would've avoided going at all costs because of how expensive hospital bills can be.\n\nWhen I protested the physician's request for chest X-rays (a force of habit, as X-rays can cost thousands of dollars in the US), she responded by telling me that it would be covered by social security.\n\nThat was the moment I understood what universal health coverage really meant.\n\nSince I've moved to France, I always do the tests and see the specialists as soon as I have a health concern. Here, looking after my health is not a luxury I have to budget for.\n\nThis story was originally published on June 27, 2023, and most recently updated on February 20, 2026.",

    "description": "\"America's Next Top Model\" has come under fire for photo shoots involving blackface and other offensive moments.",
    "fullText": "When \"America's Next Top Model\" premiered over 20 years ago, it quickly became a cultural phenomenon that catapulted multiple careers and redefined reality television.\n\nHowever, the show has also come under fire over the years for its many controversial moments, culminating in the newly released Netflix documentary series \"Reality Check: America's Next Top Model,\" which explored the darker side of \"ANTM.\"\n\nFrom insensitive photo shoots to the mistreatment of contestants, what once aired as entertainment now reads as deeply uncomfortable, racist, fat-shaming, and insensitive.\n\nHere's a look back at 14 of the most uncomfortable moments in \"America's Next Top Model\" history.\n\nBusiness Insider reached out to CBS, the studio that produced \"ANTM,\" Tyra Banks, and Ken Mok for comment, but didn't receive a response.\n\nIn Cycle 4, which aired in 2005, multiple white contestants posed as Black women while wearing makeup that was significantly darker than their own skin tones.\n\nWhile one of the contestants was getting her makeup done, she said she looked like \"a Black woman with a nose job.\"\n\nIn Cycle 13, which premiered in 2009, the models were asked to pose in a \"biracial\" photo shoot, wearing makeup and costumes meant to suggest two different ethnicities. Multiple contestants wore thick makeup that darkened their skin tone.\n\nThe incidents have since come under fire for being racially insensitive and examples of blackface.\n\nThe photo shoot's creative director, Jay Manuel, later addressed the backlash, saying it made him uncomfortable at the time.\n\n\"Many times when you're working in an environment like that, you have to listen to your executive producers, and ultimately the two voices at the top were Ken [Mok] and Tyra [Banks],\" Manuel told Variety in May 2020. \"I was so, so, so uncomfortable with this. …I was basically told that I had to execute the creative, and it made me very uncomfortable.\"\n\nIn a now-deleted tweet addressing the controversy in May 2020, Banks said, \"Been seeing the posts about the insensitivity of some past ANTM moments, and I agree with you. Looking back, those were some really off choices. Appreciate your honest feedback and am sending so much love and virtual hugs.\"\n\nThe show's co-creator, Ken Mok, also apologized to viewers in May 2020, tweeting, \"I look at some of those moments and cringe. Just a FYI — the entire creative team made the choices on those shows — not just Tyra.\"\n\nManuel disputed this in his interview with Variety, saying Mok and Banks made the final decisions.\n\nIn \"Reality Check,\" Manuel also spoke about how deeply uncomfortable he was with doing the shoot and said that he tried to avoid it altogether, but was told to show up and \"do his job.\"\n\nThe Cycle 10 photo shoot, which aired in 2008, tasked the contestants with posing in drab clothing while unhoused women stood in the background in more glamorous outfits. One of the actual homeless women in the shoot, Isis King, was scouted to apply for the following season, after which she became one of the franchise's most famous contestants.\n\nIn one scene at the photo shoot, contestant Fatima spoke about living in a shelter when she was younger.\n\nWhen asked what she was thinking about during the shoot, she said, \"She's wearing beautiful clothes,\" pointing to one of the background models. \"I'm homeless, wishing I was in her shoes.\"\n\nViewers have since described the photo shoot as \"out of touch\" and disrespectful.\n\nIt's no secret that many of the \"America's Next Top Model\" contestants had to undergo extensive, and sometimes painful, makeovers at the start of their seasons.\n\nJael, a contestant on Cycle 8 of the show in 2007, was given brown extensions. However, after having them installed in an eight-hour, extremely painful process, she was told they would have to remove them and cut her hair short because they weren't elevating her look.\n\n\"As my hair is being cut off, I just feel kind of traumatized,\" she said in a scene from the show.\n\n\"I have never had to go through that ordeal of getting my hair done,\" Whitney, a Black contestant, said of the makeover. \"Having to get it taken out the same day you get it put in — that's absolute hell.\"\n\nIn the extremely hard-to-watch episode, Sullivan and the other contestants go on \"go-and-sees\" in Milan and later invite the Italian men who drove them to and from each designer to their shared apartment to socialize.\n\nIn \"Reality Check,\" Sullivan said the night began to spiral out of control as everyone drank more and more wine. She herself drank two bottles alone, she said in the documentary series.\n\n\"I just remember little bits and pieces,\" she said.\n\nSullivan said that her memory stopped right about the point when she and her fellow contestants got in the hot tub with a few of the men, and she began kissing one of them.\n\n\"I think after getting out of the hot tub, and whatever happened after that, I think they should have been like, 'All right, this has gone too far. Like, we got to pull her out of this,'\" she said.\n\nSullivan said she came to briefly and remembered someone being on top of her. She later learned they had sex without her informed consent, and was only told she could call her boyfriend back at home when she threatened to quit the show.\n\nDistraught and traumatized, she was taken to a nearby doctor. Sullivan and her boyfriend reconciled but eventually broke up amid the intense public backlash.\n\nIn \"Reality Check,\" executive producer Ken Mok said the contestants knew that film crews and producers were told to capture everything, 24 hours a day, with very few exceptions, such as contestants using the bathroom. He also said that the scene with Shandi and the Italian man was scaled back tremendously due to regulations over what you could show, but also called it one of the series' \"most memorable moments.\"\n\n\"I do remember her story. It's a little difficult for me to talk about production, because that's not my territory,\" Banks said of the incident. \"I'm not head of story, that's [executive producer] Ken Mok. But I did become a master editor. It's important for people to know that we didn't put everything on TV.\"\n\nIn one of the most talked-about scenes from \"America's Next Top Model,\" Banks raised her voice at an eliminated contestant, Tiffany Richardson, whom she accused of being too flippant and seeing the competition as a joke.\n\n\"I was rooting for you! We were all rooting for you! How dare you?\" Banks yelled in the clip. \"Learn something from this! When you go to bed at night, you lay there, and you take responsibility for yourself. Because nobody's going to take responsibility for you. You rolling your eyes ... It's because you've heard it all before.\"\n\nRichardson had previously spoken about how much her family had sacrificed to help her enter the competition.\n\n\"You don't know where the hell I come from,\" Banks added. \"You have no idea what I've been through, but I'm not a victim. I grow from it, and I learn. Take responsibility for yourself!\"\n\nThe incident has since become a pop-culture meme, although the scene was uncomfortable.\n\nBanks addressed the viral moment in \"Reality Check,\" saying she \"lost it.\"\n\n\"It was family, friends, society, Black girls, all the challenges that we have, so many people saying that we're not good enough. I think all that was in that moment,\" she said in the documentary, adding that she went too far.\n\nRichardson also released a statement calling Banks a \"liar\" and a \"bully.\"\n\n\"You know how you treated me the whole time off and on camera,\" Richardson said in a since-deleted Instagram post, The Huffington Post reported. \"You treated me like s*** and said the nastiest things about me and my son. That is not how the argument went but YALL EDITED TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE YOU CARED.\"\n\n\"ANTM\" judge Jay Manuel later described the incident as the \"most difficult moment on set I had ever experienced,\" saying \"production staff literally just took Tyra off set\" once filming was underway.\n\n\"Some of the things that were said were not well-intentioned. I will probably never repeat the lines that were actually said in the room that day,\" he added.\n\n\"I'm gay, and I'm really proud of it,\" Kim Stolz, who is a lesbian, told Banks and the other judges during her audition.\n\nBanks replied, \"I think there's a certain thing of being proud. Like, I'm Black and proud, you know what I mean? But I'm not walking down the red carpet: 'I'm Black. I'm Black.'\"\n\n\"No, I certainly won't walk down the red carpet and try to kiss girls on the way. That's not what I'm going to do,\" Stolz responded.\n\nJay Manuel later criticized the incident, saying he felt uncomfortable about Banks' remarks.\n\n\"I was in the room, and I was sitting right next to her. I remember feeling a little uncomfortable with the statement,\" he told Variety in 2020. \"I could see Tyra trying to draw the parallel and what she was trying to illustrate, and I was confused by it.\"\n\nWhen Evans was sent to the dentist, she refused to have the gap between her teeth closed. Banks later asked why she chose not to, telling her that a gap tooth wasn't \"marketable.\" In the end, Evans partially closed her gap.\n\nBanks has since faced backlash over the incident, with social media users criticizing how she and runway coach Miss J. Alexander handled the situation.\n\nEvans spoke about the incident in an Instagram video in May 2020, saying, \"It doesn't matter if you have a gap, stacked teeth, straight teeth, it matters not.\"\n\nShe added, \"It doesn't matter if you're Black, brown, white, indifferent, other. What makes you beautiful is in here.\"\n\nJay Manuel applauded Evans in the comments, saying, \"Yes ... speak your #truth!\"\n\nOn Instagram Live, Miss J. Alexander also called Evans' statement \"brilliant.\"\n\nTo make her look more edgy and \"high-fashion,\" Banks suggested that Chelsey widen the gap between her teeth. She went through with the procedure and was the runner-up in her season.\n\nSome viewers said encouraging Chelsey to widen her tooth gap was hypocritical and had racist undertones, considering their past conversations with Danielle about her teeth.\n\n\"It's definitely not coincidental that the fashion industry seems to love gap teeth on a white girl and find them 'ratchet' on a black girl,\" one Reddit user commented.\n\nIn a 2020 video interview with judge Jay Manuel, Chelsey said she couldn't \"speak for Dani and her cycle, or where Tyra's vision was then, or if I feel like fashion was in a different direction.\"\n\n\"I had no problem [widening my gap], nobody forced me,\" she said. \"It was Tyra's idea, but I felt very comfortable if I wanted to say no.\"\n\n\"I think it was a really good idea,\" she added. \"They probably could've even widened it a bit more.\"\n\nHannah White, who came from a small town in Alaska, was confronted by fellow contestant Joslyn, who took issue with White calling herself a \"stereotypical white girl\" while in the hot tub with her fellow contestants Brittany, who is Black and Native American, and Sheena, who is Asian American.\n\nWhite was also criticized for pushing away fellow contestant Isis King in a hot tub after she felt like her personal space was being invaded.\n\nShe was then asked by Joslyn, another Black contestant, if she was \"prejudiced,\" causing White to break down in tears.\n\n\"Am I a racist? No,\" Hannah answers, before calling the accusations \"not very nice.\"\n\nBusiness Insider reached out to White for comment, but she declined.\n\nDuring her season, Ward received comments on her thin, tall frame. She was over 6 feet tall and, in one scene, runway coach Miss J. Alexander showed how his hands could completely wrap around the model's narrow waist.\n\nTyra Banks also commented on Ward's body, saying, \"You have the smallest waist in the world. Look at that waist,\" upon first seeing Ward.\n\nBanks later said, \"There's something about her I quite like.\"\n\n\"As a leader in celebrating and promoting healthy body image, I must admit that I regrettably didn't see this clip before it was released to the public,\" Banks said in a statement to People.\n\n\"But on behalf of the Top Model team, these were not the intentions, and we truly apologize for any confusion, anger, or disappointment it may have caused.\"\n\nFormer contestants on \"America's Next Top Model\" spoke in \"Reality Check\" about the high pressure to keep their weights low during the competition, and said that some girls developed disordered eating habits while on the show.\n\nFormer contestant Keenyah Hill, who appeared on Cycle 4, spoke on \"Reality Check\" about the comments she heard from judges about her body and the weight she gained during the season.\n\nIn the documentary, Banks apologized and admitted that standards around body size and shape were different when the show was airing, and previous comments don't reflect her attitude about body positivity now.\n\nDuring one photo shoot, DiMarco, who speaks American Sign Language and relied on a translator and his phone to communicate, had no idea when his photo was being taken because he couldn't hear the director calling out when to pose.\n\nEven using a flashlight to signal when to pose didn't work, as DiMarco said he didn't always know the order, and the camera's flash left him blinded. In the end, the director had to bang on the elevated platform DiMarco was standing on in order to alert him when to pose. DiMarco ended up in the bottom two in the episode.\n\nSome social media users called it exploitative of his disability.\n\n\"This shoot only existed so they could create drama around Nyle's disability and then put him in the bottom two for suspense,\" one Reddit user commented. \"Nyle was competent and deserved to be there, and they tried to always give him more obstacles to 'overcome' instead of just treating him like a human and giving him reasonable (actually useful) accommodations.\"\n\nDiMarco admitted that not being able to use American Sign Language with the other contestants and those around him was difficult throughout the season.\n\n\"The inability to use my language, American Sign Language and the lack of communication, information access, and the general connection to the world was difficult,\" he told People in 2015. \"It truly did take a toll on me mentally ... I even cringe now when I watch myself on 'ANTM' being all alone.\"",

    "title": "Supreme Court strikes down swath of Trump's tariffs",
    "description": "The Supreme Court fast-tracked a case over whether President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court struck down a chunk of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff policy on Friday, ruling that the White House exceeded its authority.\n\nThe 6-3 decision centered on the tariffs Trump justified under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a national security law that allows the president to regulate economic activity during emergencies.\n\nThose IEEPA-justified tariffs have been one of Trump's most powerful weapons in his efforts to renegotiate trade agreements around the globe. They include Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, announced in April, which are at least 10% on nearly every country in the world.\n\nIn the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that the Trump administration's use of the law to impose taxes on imports, which is normally the purview of Congress, went too far. Trump would need a distinct law from Congress \"to justify his extraordinary assertion of the power to impose tariffs,\" he wrote.\n\n\"What common sense suggests, congressional practice confirms,\" he wrote. \"When Congress has delegated its tariff powers, it has done so in explicit terms, and subject to strict limits.\"\n\nThe majority decision was joined by four separate concurring opinions, by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barnett, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. They all supplied different arguments on how important it was for the Supreme Court to consult legislative history and invoke the \"major questions doctrine\" — the idea that presidents need clear Congressional authorization for decisions of significant political and economic importance.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision comes as the United States trade deficit ticked down over the last year, largely due to the Trump administration's tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods. It shrank to $29.4 billion in October, the lowest figure since 2009, before ticking back up in the last two months of the year, Commerce Department data published Thursday showed.\n\nTwo groups of businesses filed lawsuits challenging Trump's authority to impose tariffs through IEEPA. The Supreme Court combined the cases and put them on the fast track, holding oral arguments at the beginning of its November term.\n\nIEEPA, a Carter-era law, gives presidents the power to \"regulate\" importation in times of emergency. The Trump administration claimed that it included the ability to impose tariffs — a position no other president has taken.\n\nLawyers representing the businesses argued that Congress would have been clear if IEEPA were meant to confer taxation and tariff powers to the president.\n\nDuring oral arguments, most justices expressed skepticism about the Trump administration's arguments. Justice Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump appointed to the bench in his first term, said taxes were \"part of the spark of the American Revolution\" and should get careful treatment.\n\n\"The power to reach into the pockets of the American people is just different,\" Gorsuch said. \"And it's been different since the founding.\"\n\nJustices Brett Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito dissented from the majority. In his opinion, Kavanaugh said the language of IEEPA ought to support tariffs.\n\n\"Interpreting IEEPA to exclude tariffs creates nonsensical textual and practical anomalies,\" he wrote. \"The plaintiffs and the Court do not dispute that the President can act in declared emergencies under IEEPA to impose quotas or even total embargoes on all imports from a given country. But the President supposedly cannot take the far more modest step of conditioning those imports on payment of a tariff or duty.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling does not affect the tariffs that Trump has imposed using other laws, and Trump still has the power to issue additional tariffs using those laws, as Kavanaugh noted in his opinion.\n\nBut his administration has favored IEEPA because of its perceived flexibility. The other laws that allow presidents to impose tariffs without explicit Congressional approval have limits — including built-in expiration dates and caps on the amount taxed. They also make it more difficult to target particular countries, rather than certain industries.",

    "description": "After years of working on cruise ships, there are mistakes I'd never make, like wearing my key around my neck or buying the unlimited drink package.",
    "fullText": "I've sailed around the world as a cruise-ship employee, and now I enjoy cruising as a passenger.\n\nI love inhaling the salty sea air, waking up in a new country, and spending lazy days by the pool — and, over the years, I've learned a lot of great tips for saving money and having a smooth sailing.\n\nHere are six things I'd never do on a cruise after working on them for three years and enjoying many as a passenger.\n\nTypically, meals in the ship's main dining room are included in the cost of a cruise. However, in recent years, it's become common for cruise lines to charge guests extra if they want to upgrade to \"supplementary\" items like lobster or certain steaks.\n\nI know $12 may not seem like much for a steak or lobster tail at dinner, but the cost of the cruise is supposed to include your food.\n\nSo, even though I enjoy lobster, I stick with the items without the upcharges.\n\nI enjoy a piña colada by the pool or a Manhattan while listening to a jazz set after dinner. Even so, it doesn't make sense for me to pay in advance for 12 to 15 cocktails a day.\n\nI've done the math on typical unlimited drink packages, and the cost simply isn't worth it for me.\n\nThis is especially true with a port-heavy itinerary. If I've gone ashore to explore all day, that means I'm not sidled up to the bar slurping down alcoholic slushies.\n\nI prefer to buy as I go and take advantage of happy hour and other drink specials offered by certain cruise lines. I also check the beverage policy in advance and bring my own wine on board, if allowed.\n\nFellow guests will never see me touching the elevator buttons with my fingertips. Knuckles and elbows do the trick.\n\nSome cruise lines are better than others at sanitizing and wiping down commonly touched surfaces, but I don't take any chances. I avoid touching things others frequently touch, and I wash my hands often.\n\nThis strategy seems to be working for me, as I have never contracted norovirus, even when it was running rampant on a ship I was on. It's quite contagious and can linger on your fingertips even after using hand sanitizer. I'd definitely rather be safe than sorry.\n\nI never walk around the ship with my room key hanging around my neck, and I especially never do this when on land.\n\nThere are two reasons for this. First, I see many passengers using the room keys dangling from their necks to flaunt their cruise loyalty status. It just looks pretentious.\n\nMany cruisers with the highest status and most days at sea never show off their fancy room keys because, as seasoned travelers, they know it can be a safety concern.\n\nIn port, that room key bouncing off your chest looks like an invitation to be robbed. It screams, \"I have money! Come and take it from me.\"\n\nEnglish is a funny language that has its quirks. Naming conventions make that even more complicated.\n\nShips have proper names, and so do not require a definite article. For example, \"Tomorrow I am embarking on Discovery Princess,\" or \"I enjoyed scenic cruising on MS Westerdam.\"\n\nIf you want to look like a savvy sailor, learn to drop the \"the!\"\n\nOh, the recurring nightmares I've had about not making it back to the ship on time during a port day.\n\nI've never missed a sail away, but I have cut it too close at times and have had to run down a pier or two.\n\nDuring one cruise, my taxi driver got lost returning our group to the port at night. When I realized how late we were going to be, I forked over $8 per minute to be connected with the ship.\n\nOver the phone, I pleaded with them to wait for us. It was a sprint through the port to get back on, and we received quite a scolding from the first officer.\n\nThat time, we got lucky. In the future, I'll be giving myself more time than I think I need to make it back.\n\nThis story was originally published on April 17, 2024, and most recently updated on February 20, 2026.",

    "fullText": "\"Should I go to the first day of the conference or see my daughter?\" I asked my group of fellow family travel writers during a Zoom meeting ahead of our work conference.\n\nThe conference would be held in New York City, where my 20-year-old daughter lives and goes to college.\n\nMy original plan was to attend the two-day conference and just have dinner with her, but then she surprised me with news. She had the whole day free, while I was in town.\n\nI decided to pull a Ferris Bueller.\n\nGrowing up, I watched \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" so many times I could've stepped in as his understudy.\n\nBut in high school, I wasn't the one jumping on parade floats or outsmarting the principal. I was more like Jeanie, the rule-following sister who never once considered skipping school.\n\nSo why did I love the movie? It wasn't just funny. It was the idea of being a maverick. As a lifelong rule-follower, Ferris represented a level of recklessness I usually reserved for using the grocery ten-item limit express lane.\n\nThis trip to New York was my chance to see my daughter. Sorry, not sorry, Principal Rooney. I'm taking the day off.\n\nEven though I grew up in New York and my daughter lives in the city, we decided to be total tourists for the day. Our CityPASS was our \"hall pass,\" giving us admission to the Guggenheim, the Empire State Building, and Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Center.\n\nThe Guggenheim was first. As an art major, this was her pick. When I first saw her in the middle of the room surrounded by art, she had a huge smile on her face. I'd like to think it was because she was happy to see me (which I think she was), but it turns out she just learned some exciting news.\n\n\"I just got an email,\" she said. \"I got an interview for the Guggenheim internship.\"\n\nWhile we were standing in the Guggenheim.\n\nI looked around for hidden cameras and half-expected someone to yell \"Cut!\" This was too surreal. What were the odds she'd find out right now, in the middle of the gallery? Here I was escaping work responsibilities, while she was standing there successfully manifesting her own.\n\nHer excitement was infectious and set the tone for the rest of the day. I was so glad to experience that with her in person.\n\nAfter we soaked up the art, we went to the Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Center and the Empire State Building. I realize that's a little redundant, but shockingly, my daughter had never been to the famous Empire State Building.\n\nAt the top, she marveled at how small everything looked from that height and discussed her plans to create art inspired by the experience.\n\nI, on the other hand, was glad to be in a tourist trap instead of a Q&A quagmire. At some point, I even forgot the conference existed.\n\nWe then opted for a three-hour Koreatown Food and Culture Walking Tour with a guide named Robert. He has Korean heritage and is a New Yorker, so it was the best of both worlds. It further helped me overcome my guilt about skipping the travel conference, and then I wondered, \"Could this count as professional development?\"\n\nMy daughter is almost done with college. She's already planning to stay in New York City over the summer, so I wouldn't be surprised if she sticks around after graduation.\n\nEven though we only spent eight hours together, it felt like a full-length Ferris film. It was definitely a better script than the one I was supposed to be following.\n\nThe following day, I attended my work conference, happy to have had that time with my daughter.\n\nIf Ferris Bueller taught us anything, it's that sometimes the side trip is the point.",

    "description": "The Ratel Robotics' robot launches fiber-optic drones close to the front lines in Ukraine so operators can stay farther back and safer.",
    "fullText": "A Ukrainian arms company says it has modified one of its ground robots to carry and launch unjammable fiber-optic drones. Ukrainian forces can put the drones in the air closer to the front without exposing pilots.\n\nRatel Robotics shared a video this week of its Ratel H model robot equipped with a protected box. In the clip, the launcher opens up and releases a small drone connected to a fiber-optic cable. The uncrewed ground vehicle functions as a mobile launch point.\n\nCEO Taras Ostapchuk told Business Insider the \"ground robot becomes like a base station\" for the up to four drones that it can carry. Those bases are typically human-operated launch points, where pilots need to be closer to danger to put the drone in the air.\n\nOstapchuk said that the ground robot can drop off operators at a safe location and then continue toward the front to launch the drones. The operators remotely controlling it and the fiber-optic drones can hang back \"in the safest place possible.\"\n\nThe aim is that \"everything is as safe as possible for all people performing this mission,\" the CEO said.\n\nFiber-optic drones, which receive signals by a thin cable rather than radio links, have become central to the war because they can't be jammed by electronic warfare like other drones — though their range is limited and the cable can be cut or snagged.\n\nIt is unclear how many of Ratel Robotics' systems have been adapted for this mission or whether they are already in the field.\n\nDrone carriers are not necessarily a new concept. For instance, Ukrainian soldiers say Russia is using its medium-sized strike drones to fly smaller drones into battle like \"an aircraft carrier.\"\n\nGround robots account for only a small share of Ukraine's drone missions, but the technology is becoming more prolific.\n\nNew Ukrainian defense minister Mykhailo Fedorov said this week that Ukrainian forces carried out more than 7,000 combat and logistics missions with ground robotic systems in January. He added that production and upgrades are accelerating.\n\nUkraine uses its fleet of ground robots for many different missions, including carrying ammunition and gear, evacuating wounded soldiers, laying mines, demining, firing on Russian positions, and exploding near targets.\n\nThe Ratel H can carry more than 880 pounds and can travel more than 37 miles. The company says it is multipurpose, able to transport cargo and evacuate wounded soldiers. The robot can also be equipped with weaponry and electronic warfare systems.\n\nThe West is paying close attention to Ukraine's fight, seeking to learn lessons about what it would need to fight Russia.\n\nGround robots are drawing close scrutiny in the West. Western militaries have fielded similar systems, but not at this scale or across so many roles, and Ukrainian companies are pushing the technology forward.",

    "description": "Yoni Assia, CEO of eToro, predicts AI stocks and crypto will rebound in 2026, while monetary policy later this year will be supportive of risk assets.",
    "fullText": "Anxiety has been high among investors and consumers lately amid a cocktail of macroeconomic and market pressures, but Yoni Assia, the founder and CEO of trading platform eToro, isn't worried.\n\nLeading tech stocks have struggled year to date amid fears of AI disruption across a wide range of industries, while bearish sentiment has pressured crypto prices lower. Assia told Business Insider, though, that he believes both markets will rebound in 2026 and that he remains optimistic about monetary policy shifts.\n\neToro competes in a crowded field of retail-oriented trading platforms, but Assia thinks the platform has carved out a niche for itself among retail traders who utilize its more advanced features. According to Assia, its users haven't shied away from trading recently but have seized the opportunity to buy the dip on discounted tech stocks.\n\n\"I definitely think that it's a bit blown up a bit in proportion,\" he said, \"I think right now, people are a bit excited about the AI correction. I think that's going to pass.\"\n\nAssia added that he's seen traders rotate away from crypto and into precious metals recently. He's not surprised by this, as gold and silver prices have stabilized while crypto continues to fall. Yet, Assia is optimistic that crypto is poised for a comeback from its brutal bear market later this year.\n\n\"After a correction, after all-time high post-halving, you get a bull run, then you have a correction, and then it basically resets three to six months after that correction,\" he said.\n\nThis view is similar to that of other crypto pros who have speculated that if historic market cycles are any guide, crypto prices are due to rebound soon.\n\nAnother factor that has weighed heavily on the minds of some investors is monetary policy shifts that may be coming as a result of Kevin Warsh's appointment to the Federal Reserve. But Assia noted that if the new Fed chair proceeds with the expected rate cuts, it will likely help spur growth for the broader market.\n\n\"Historically, as rate cuts go lower, trading volumes go higher and leverage goes higher in the industry in general,\" he stated. \"The cost of borrowing money goes down, and the ability to more easily leverage goes up, which elevates stocks in the long run.\"",

    "fullText": "Tesla rival Lucid is slashing its workforce as the EV winter tightens its grip.\n\nEV startup Lucid is cutting 12% of US employees, according to an email interim CEO Marc Winterhoff sent to unaffected employees on Friday, which Business Insider has seen.\n\nWinterhoff said the cuts would exclude hourly production employees in manufacturing, logistics, and quality.\n\n\"This difficult but necessary decision was made to improve organisational effectiveness and optimize our resources as we continue on our path toward profitability,\" he wrote.\n\nIt comes as Lucid faces a difficult environment for EV makers amid an industry-wide downturn, with EV sales plummeting industry-wide in the US following the end of the $7,500 tax credit in September.\n\nDespite slowing demand for electric vehicles in the US, Lucid's sales more than doubled last year, as it scaled up production of its new Gravity SUV.\n\nHowever, the EV startup continues to burn cash as it struggles to become profitable. In its most recent earnings in November, the company reported a net loss of nearly $1 billion.\n\nLucid reports Q4 earnings next week. Techcrunch first reported the layoffs.\n\nA Lucid spokesperson told Business Insider the cuts would not impact the company's hourly production workforce in Arizona, adding that the cuts were designed to \"streamline\" the organisation as it seeks long-term growth and margin improvement.\n\n\"We are grateful for the contributions of all impacted employees and are providing resources, benefits, and support to assist them through this transition,\" they said.\n\nRead Lucid CEO Marc Winterhoff's full memo:\n\nToday I want to share an important business update. We have implemented a 12% reduction of our U.S. workforce, excluding hourly production employees in manufacturing, logistics, and quality. This difficult but necessary decision was made to improve operational effectiveness and optimize our resources as we continue on our path toward profitability. If you are receiving this message, your role is not impacted.\n\nWe are streamlining our organization so we can operate with greater efficiency and deliver on our commitments to gross margin improvement and long-term growth. We will continue to evaluate our day-to-day work to ensure that our time, energy, and resources remain focused on the initiatives that drive the greatest impact. This disciplined approach to execution is a core operational imperative for Lucid.\n\nImportantly, today's actions do not affect our strategy. Our core priorities remain unchanged, and we continue to focus on the start of production of our Midsize platform. With disciplined execution, we are also focused on further expansion into the robotaxi market, continued ADAS and software development, and growth in sales of Lucid Gravity and Air across existing and new geographies.\n\nSaying goodbye to colleagues is never easy. We are grateful for the contributions of those impacted by today's actions, and we are providing severance, bonus, continued health benefits, and transition support to help them through this period. As we move through today, I ask everyone to treat one another with empathy, professionalism, and respect, recognizing the personal impact these changes have on our teammates.\n\nTo sustain and build on progress made in 2025, we must remain focused, operate with discipline, and execute with urgency. I know we are asking a great deal of our team, and I sincerely appreciate your continued commitment, resilience, and professionalism.\n\nI will address today's actions and answer questions during Monday's Town Hall. As always, you may presubmit your questions on The Hub.",

    "title": "'Everybody is switching': A United exec took aim at American as the airlines battle at Chicago O'Hare",
    "description": "United Airlines is expanding its presence at Chicago O'Hare Airport, and executives aren't holding back in criticizing American Airlines.",
    "fullText": "United Airlines is determined to humble American Airlines as they battle for dominance at Chicago O'Hare Airport.\n\nMike Leskinen, United's chief financial officer, said at a Barclays conference on Wednesday that American operates a hub there only \"temporarily.\"\n\n\"Everybody is switching from American to United,\" he added.\n\nChicago is a valuable hub for airlines because its Midwest location makes it a useful connection point to other cities across the country. Last year, it saw more aircraft take off and land than any other US airport.\n\nChicago's 9.5 million metro population and status as a major financial center also mean there are plenty of passengers seeking premium seats, which turn a healthy profit for airlines.\n\nAbout 40% of passengers at O'Hare fly with United, compared to 23% with American, according to the latest data from the Department of Transportation.\n\nUnited is planning to expand its presence in the Windy City.\n\nLate last month, it announced five new routes from O'Hare and said it would add additional flights on existing routes. That will bring its total to 750 daily flights this summer — about 200 more than American, it said.\n\nAmerican has said it added 180 destinations from O'Hare over the past year.\n\n\"There's a lot of capacity being added to Chicago, but not all capacity is created equal,\" Leskinen told the conference.\n\n\"We made a nice profit last year in Chicago,\" he added. \"The other guy that's adding so much capacity is not.\"\n\nDeutsche Bank analysts estimated that American is operating at a negative 9% margin at O'Hare, and that United's margin is 5%.\n\nUnited is also working to acquire two gates at the airport through Spirit Airlines' bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nIn an internal memo seen by Business Insider, Omar Idris, United's vice president for O'Hare, said the gates will provide \"the flexibility we need to keep growing responsibly and to continue building an operation that reflects the leadership position United holds in this city.\"\n\nAnd CEO Scott Kirby said in last month's earnings call, \"We're drawing a line in the sand. We are not going to allow them [American] to win a single gate at our expense in 2026.\"\n\nAmerican Airlines did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn recent years, American has lagged behind its rivals, United and Delta Air Lines.\n\nFor 2025, it reported a pre-tax profit of $352 million, down 80% from the year before. United's adjusted pre-tax profit was $4.6 billion, and Delta Air Lines' $5 billion for the year.\n\nIn part, this is because American has struggled to attract as many premium customers. Since the pandemic, more US travellers have been spending extra on luxury experiences.\n\n\"Not only do we have a better hard product, but we have the schedule, and we have the connectivity, we have the clubs,\" United CFO Leskinen said on Wednesday.\n\nEarlier this month, American announced a new lounge at O'Hare to replace its existing one, but didn't mention a planned opening date.\n\nThe airline's recent struggles have drawn ire from its workers. Its flight attendants' union has issued a vote of no confidence in American's leadership and held a protest outside its Fort Worth headquarters.",

    "description": "The Supreme Court said its rationale for overturning most of Trump's tariffs was the same one it used to strike down Biden's student-loan forgiveness.",
    "fullText": "What do broad student-loan forgiveness and tariffs have in common? More than you might think, according to the nation's highest court.\n\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court struck down most of President Donald Trump's tariffs, ruling that he lacked the authority to enact his expansive tariff policies under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. While IEEPA allows the president to regulate economic activity during emergencies, the Supreme Court said that Trump's tariffs went beyond the law's threshold.\n\nIf that argument sounds familiar, it's because it's the same one the Supreme Court made in 2023 when it struck down former President Joe Biden's broad student-loan forgiveness plan.\n\nAs Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in his concurring opinion on Friday, the court requires \"clear congressional authorization\" to carry out broad economic policies like student-loan forgiveness or tariffs.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts echoed that in his tariff opinion, writing that in Biden v. Nebraska, the student-debt ruling, the court \"declined to read authorization to 'waive or modify' statutory or regulatory provisions applicable to financial assistance programs as a delegation of power to cancel $430 billion in student loan debt.\"\n\nRoberts referred to the major questions doctrine, which requires federal agencies to have clear, congressional authorization — not ambiguous legal language — before enacting broad economic policies. He said that while Trump's administration said that the doctrine should not apply in the tariff case, that \"argument is nearly identical to one it already advanced\" in the student-debt case.\n\n\"There, the Government contended that a different emergency statute should be interpreted broadly because its 'whole point' was to provide 'substantial discretion to . . . respond to unforeseen emergencies,'\" Roberts wrote. \"We rejected that argument in Nebraska, and we reject it here as well.\"\n\nBiden's student-loan forgiveness plan would have canceled up to $20,000 in debt for federal borrowers. Biden's administration was using the HEROES Act of 2003 to attempt to enact the relief, which gave the education secretary the ability to waive or modify student-loan balances in connection with a national emergency, like the pandemic. Just as it did in the tariff decision, the Supreme Court ruled at the time that the relief went beyond the law.\n\nTrump has not yet commented on the Supreme Court's ruling, and it does not affect the tariffs the president has imposed under laws other than IEEPA.",

    "description": "My wife and I moved from New York City to Versailles, France, for her career. I expected my life to change here, but it looks largely the same.",
    "fullText": "We're a 10-minute walk from the Palace of Versailles. My wife attends ISIPCA, one of the most prestigious graduate perfumery programs in the world, and I'm an American writer living right outside Paris.\n\nIt may sound glamorous, but my daily routine hasn't really changed. Before our move in October, I sat in front of a computer all day. After our move, my life has looked pretty much the same.\n\nI must admit, there was a wide-eyed part of me that thought the lifestyle of an American expat living outside Paris would all but confirm my Great American Novel, but the reality was much more boring.\n\nAlthough there are major differences in etiquette, architecture, food, and language, as a work-from-home writer, I was surprised to find myself mostly insulated from them.\n\nI arrived here knowing nobody but my wife. Most of the time, I'm alone all day.\n\nSometimes I FaceTime friends and family back home, but the six-hour time difference forms a barrier. By the time they're getting off work, it's midnight in Versailles.\n\nI can go days without speaking French, unless you count Babbel.\n\nWhen I do, it's in 60-second batches, ordering a baguette at the nearby boulangerie or picking up a cheap bottle of Beaujolais at the local épicerie for a carb-heavy dinner.\n\nThen, I return to the apartment to write in English for hours on end, which is the same way I spent my time in New York.\n\nGranted, there are reminders even in my apartment that I'm in a different place: The hot water doesn't last long, the kitchen tile is a dark terra-cotta with darker grout, and the labels of the spices and sauces left behind in the kitchen are, naturally, all in French.\n\nWhen I look out of the window, I see the slate-colored mansard roofs that match the persistent gray of wintry Versailles.\n\nAfter a while, though, even these charming distinctions recede into the furniture of daily life.\n\nAs an expat working remotely, I soon realized I would have to be proactive if I wanted to meet new people.\n\nThe halcyon days of friends falling into my lap — as in college or in my early career, when my coworkers functioned as my adoptive New York family — were long gone. No, I would have to take initiative.\n\nI made an effort to tap into the community of expat writers in Paris. I connected with a couple of Paris-based writers online, and then met up with them for coffee.\n\nOne of them, a poet and a scholar, told me about an Anglophone writers' salon in Paris. I went to the event, read some of my work, and met fellow English-speaking writers, mostly American and British.\n\nAnother invited me to a literary journal launch event in Le Marais. At the launch party, I ran into a few people I'd met at the salon a couple of days earlier, including a friendly English guy who invited me to a reading at his apartment in the 19th arrondissement.\n\nEarlier that week, I didn't know anyone in Paris. Suddenly, I was bumping into people I knew at a party, then getting invited to another one.\n\nParties always come to an end. Daily routine reasserts itself. My wife leaves first thing and doesn't return until dark.\n\nDuring the day, all I hear is the clacking of the keys and the groaning of the floorboards whenever I walk to the kitchen for another cup of coffee. I welcome chores and errands, which break up the lonely monotony.\n\nWhen my wife comes home and asks me how my day was, I don't know how to respond. \"Same,\" I think. \"Always the same.\"\n\nThat's not entirely true, though. Some days are punctuated by heartwarming messages or small wins, like a friend reaching out or an editor accepting one of my stories.\n\nThe bulk of my daily activities, however, remains unchanged. Admittedly, this malaise may be more a function of remote work than being alone in a strange place; I felt a similar isolation working remotely in New York, after all.\n\nIt took my wife and me years to start to find a sense of community in our neighborhood. That didn't just happen. We had to work for it. Around the time we were figuring that out, my wife got her acceptance letter.\n\nI suppose the repetitiveness of daily life is hardly unique, but I was surprised to find how similar it was here. Routine notwithstanding, I'm lucky. I live in a beautiful place, and I get to do the thing I love, as does my wife.\n\nLiving in Versailles has put into focus something that was starting to come into view back in the US: The life you want doesn't come knocking on your door, regardless of where you are. You have to go out and find it.",

    "description": "The new series, starring Paul Anthony Kelly and Sarah Pidgeon, recreates several of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy's real outfits.",
    "fullText": "The iconic style of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy has been often imitated but never replicated — until now.\n\n\"Love Story,\" which is produced by Ryan Murphy for FX, chronicles the fated relationship between John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, who died in a plane crash off the coast of Martha's Vineyard in July 1999.\n\nThe series has drawn praise for its striking casting — with Sarah Pidgeon bearing an uncanny resemblance to Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy and Paul Anthony Kelly closely capturing the look of John F. Kennedy Jr. — as well as for its thoughtful costume design, which carefully recreates and honors Bessette-Kennedy's real-life style.\n\nHere's a look at how the show recreated and paid homage to Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy's style.\n\nIn this scene, before she meets John F. Kennedy Jr. for the first time, Carolyn (played by Sarah Pidgeon) wears a simple black turtleneck, flared black capri pants, and black leather loafers.\n\nIn both the show and real life, Bessette-Kennedy worked as a showroom assistant for Calvin Klein before rising the ranks to become head of publicity for the fashion house.\n\nShe was often seen wearing loose Levi's 517 jeans, her hair slicked back into a bun, with a simple monochromatic coat over the top.\n\nWhen it came to recreating the New York City icon's style, the series didn't always nail it. Early leaked images from the set were criticized online for being too modern, fast-fashion-looking, and different from Kennedy-Bessette's more upscale style.\n\nIn response to the backlash, the show brought in a new costume designer, Rudy Mance, who dedicated himself to making the costumes as accurate as possible.\n\n\"I get it. I'm protective of [John and Carolyn] as well. We all just wanted to be as precise and accurate as possible,\" Mance told Variety.\n\nMance said he and his team studied for months throughout filming, comparing old paparazzi photos of the couple with the new looks he was creating for the show and pulling in as many archival and vintage pieces as possible to accurately recreate the look.\n\n\"There's so much mystery about Carolyn. My familiarity with her was through paparazzi images,\" lead actor Sarah Pidgeon told Vogue.\n\nMance said that recreating Kennedy's style before she was thrust into the public eye was the most challenging.\n\n\"Everybody knows what they wore from 1996 to 1999, but we were telling the story of how they met,\" he said, according to Glamour.\n\nBessette-Kennedy often looked effortlessly sexy when she stepped out on red carpets, like in the strapless black Yohji Yamamoto gown photographed above. Pidgeon wears a similar dress for her meet-cute with Kelly in episode one of the series.\n\nIt was delicate work for Pidgeon to strike the same balance, especially when fans reacted strongly to early images of her in the role. However, the actor told Vogue she was ultimately grateful for the public feedback about her portrayal.\n\n\"The online conversations at the beginning of the process served as a reminder of how important it was to get our portrayal of Carolyn correct. She grew even more important to me,\" Pidgeon told Vogue. \"People really, really love Carolyn, and my priority every single day on set was doing justice to her legacy.\"\n\nAlthough Bessette-Kennedy's simple outfits could be recreated with off-brand designers — like the white blouse and floor-length black skirt by Yohji Yamamoto that she wore in 1999 — Mance was dedicated to finding archival pieces. Pidgeon was wearing true recreations of Bessette-Kennedy's looks whenever possible.\n\nHe also ensured the pieces would fit Pidgeon similarly to how they fit Bessette-Kennedy, as Pidgeon told Vogue.\n\n\"We found her Prada and Valentino coats, and fitted some Levi's so that they looked exactly how they fit Carolyn,\" Pidgeon told Vogue.\n\nKennedy's clothes were always going to play a central part in her on-screen portrayal since style was so critical to her identity. However, Pidgeon said she hoped the clothes she wears offer a jumping-off point for the total woman she hopes to portray.\n\n\"She is known as this minimalist fashion icon, but I learned that she was also vivacious, funny, and had a wildness about her,\" she told Vogue.",

    "description": "Major indexes rose on Friday, with investors looking past a weak GDP report after the Supreme Court ruled that Trump's tariffs are illegal.",
    "fullText": "Stocks rose on Friday after the Supreme Court ruled that Donald Trump's tariffs are illegal.\n\nUS stocks reversed earlier losses after the Supreme Court struck down the sweeping trade policy the president unveiled last April. The decision is a major update to an issue that's been a source of intense uncertainty and volatility for much of the last year, and will also raise new questions about how Trump might pursue his landmark policy push.\n\nHere's where major indexes stood around noon ET on Friday:\n\nThe news on tariffs outweighed a disappointing update on economic growth, while PCE inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, heated up faster than expected. GDP grew 1.4% year-over-year last quarter, falling far short of estimates, while PCE rose 0.4% in December, slightly above the anticipated 0.3% gain.\n\n\"The market just totally erupted,\" Jose Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, told Business Insider. \"In the short run, it's good for corporate earnings.\"\n\nHere are four big takeaways for investors.\n\nThe Supreme Court blocked Trump's ability to impose tariffs through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that allows the president to regulate economic activity in emergency events.\n\nBut there are a handful of other legal avenues the president could use to try to impose tariffs again, according to Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at Pepperstone.\n\n\"The Trump administration can impose pretty much the equivalent levies if they so wish to, which you'd imagine they do,\" he told Business Insider, adding that his outlook on US trade policy hadn't changed significantly over the long term.\n\n\"The president has already signalled that he will quickly pivot to other legal tools to achieve similar trade restrictions, and he has at his disposal multiple levers to pull in order to circumvent the verdict,\" Matthew Ryan, the head of market strategy at Ebury, wrote on Friday, adding that Trump's longer-term strategy for tariffs was \"unlikely to be derailed.\"\n\n\"The ball is now in the administration's court—specifically the willingness and ability to impose tariffs under alternative legal authorities,\" Mohamed El-Erian, a top economist and the chief economic advisor at Allianz, said in a post on X.\n\nShould Trump impose new tariffs, it's likely that import duties will be lower due to the legal precedent set by the SCOTUS ruling, according to Heather Long, the chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.\n\n\"In particular, it will be harder for the White House to impose tariffs without clear justification and due process. Businesses and consumers will get more clarity and lower rates going forward,\" Long wrote in a note on Friday.\n\nThe positive market reaction on Friday suggests that investors think tariff refunds are a possibility, according to Pepperstone's Brown.\n\nJoseph Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM US, said he believed the US would likely issue between $100 billion and $130 billion in tariff refunds.\n\n\"When one thinks about the fiscal tailwind that may inject $100-150 billion in cash to American households this year in addition to tariff refunds we are talking real money,\" he wrote in a post on X, referring to the amount households are expected to get in tax refunds this year.\n\nIt's unclear how the refunds, if the US will issue any, will work, Long said.\n\n\"The refund process will be a mess,\" she wrote. \"It's likely the White House will fight against issuing refunds at all.\n\nBond yields ticked higher shortly after the Supreme Court ruling on tariffs, a sign that concerns are beginning to swell over the US debt picture again, now that tariff revenue, for the moment, has been taken off the table.\n\n\"Tariffs had been functioning as a shadow tax that helped fund spending without explicitly raising taxes. Remove that and the deficit widens, borrowing rises, and historically that is the type of development that leans on the bond market and pressures yields higher,\" Mark Malek, the CIO of Siebert Financial, wrote in a note on Friday.",

    "description": "Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said that the \"whole supply chain\" for memory chips is constrained, which also impacts AI research.",
    "fullText": "The memory shortage takes no prisoners. Even Google isn't immune.\n\nAI companies are duking it out for greater and greater quantities of memory chips. The problem? The industry is heavily supply-constrained. Costs have skyrocketed, products have been tied up, and some companies — especially those in consumer electronics — are increasing prices.\n\nOn the AI front, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis told CNBC that physical challenges were \"constraining a lot of deployment.\" Google sees \"so much more demand\" for Gemini and its other models than it could serve, he said.\n\n\"Also, it does constrain a little bit the research,\" Hassabis said. \"You need a lot of chips to be able to experiment on new ideas at a big enough scale that you can actually see if they're going to work.\"\n\nResearchers want chips, whether they work at Google, Meta, OpenAI, or other Big Tech companies, and memory is a key component. Mark Zuckerberg said that AI researchers demanded two things beyond money: the fewest number of people reporting to them, and the most chips possible.\n\nHassabis said that wherever there was a capacity constraint, there was a \"choke point.\"\n\n\"The whole supply chain is kind of strained,\" Hassabis said. \"We're lucky, because we have our own TPUs, so we have our own chip designs.\"\n\nGoogle has long built TPUs — Tensor Processing Units — for internal use. The company also leases them to external customers through its cloud, which has also put Nvidia on edge.\n\nBut even access to their own TPUs won't save Google from having to navigate the highly competitive memory market. \"It still, in the end, actually comes down to a few suppliers of a few key components,\" Hassabis said.\n\nThree suppliers dominate memory chip production: Samsung, Micron, and SK Hynix. These companies are struggling to meet demand for chips from AI hyperscalers without dropping their longtime electronics customers.\n\nIt doesn't help that AI companies mainly want a different type of memory chip than PC manufacturers do. Large language model producers want HBM (high-bandwidth memory) chips.\n\nDon't expect Google's spending on AI infrastructure and chips to go down anytime soon. On its fourth-quarter earnings call, the company projected capital expenditures of $175 billion to $185 billion for 2026.",

But a new study shows that how fast leaders change in response to this feedback shapes whether employees see them as authentic—and how likely they’ll be to share insights in the future. Across field and experimental studies, rapid shifts—especially on hard-to-change behaviors like listening—appeared disingenuous, dampening their willingness to give future feedback. Gradual change, however, was more often read as sincere growth. Before responding to feedback, leaders should pause, think deeply about the feedback, and communicate both intentions and process—verbally and nonverbally—to align visible behavior with signals of meaningful change.",

    "title": "Why Cardio and Strength Training Are Both Important",
    "description": "Runners, you've gotta lift. And lifters, sets of 10 do not count as cardio.",
    "fullText": "Cardio and strength training are both important, but it's easy to end up only doing one of those and conveniently forgetting to get around to the other. I’ve been on both sides of the fence. As a runner, I would go months without lifting a weight or doing any purposeful strength training, because who has the time? And in my more recent life as a lifter, I’d join in the joking about how more than 10 reps is cardio, har har. But here’s the truth: we all need strength training and real cardio.\n\nI think it’s easy to gravitate to one type of exercise because we find it fun or convenient. Then, when we feel like we’re sufficiently challenged, there’s no need to look further, right? I’m already an athlete, I remember thinking during both of my extreme phases. But both times, I was missing something.\n\nMost obviously, strength training makes you stronger. That means you’re better able to lift weights, but it also means you build the strength reserves to do better in other sports. Strong legs to help you run up hills, for example. Strength training also means you’ll be stronger in everyday life, and chores like carrying groceries or shoveling snow will feel easier.\n\nStrength training can mean lifting weights, but it can also include other types of resistance training. It’s called “resistance” because you’re literally working against some kind of force. Maybe you’re working with dumbbells or resistance bands, or maybe you’re creating a force to resist with your own body, as in pushups or air squats.\n\nOur muscle mass decreases with age, but the more muscle you have to start with, the better off you’ll be. (There’s no such thing as “too old” to train, and in fact, the older you are the more important it is.) Loss of muscle, called sarcopenia, contributes to the likelihood of falls and fractures. Exercise slows and can possibly reverse that loss. So if longevity is one of your fitness interests, that's all the more reason to prioritize strength training.\n\nStrength training also helps bone health and joint flexibility. People who strength train also tend to have better balance and may have an easier time controlling their weight.\n\nCardiovascular exercise includes steady-state endurance work like jogging, as well as interval training where you alternate between harder and easier work but keep moving the whole time. Ideally, you should do both kinds of cardio, since they each have slightly different benefits. If you're confused about which activities count as cardio, I have an explainer here. Think hiking, running, cycling, or gym machines like the elliptical.\n\nCardio exercise is great for your heart health, as the name suggests. Regular cardio helps to reduce your blood pressure, reduce your “bad” cholesterol, and increase your “good” cholesterol. It may help you maintain a healthy weight, since burning more calories gives you a little more leeway for extra calories you might want to consume. Both cardio and strength training increase your insulin sensitivity, which is especially important if you have type 2 diabetes or are considered prediabetic.\n\nBesides those benefits, cardio also helps with the other activities you do. With better cardio fitness, you’ll be able to recover more quickly between sets of heavy lifting exercises, and you’ll have an easier time of everyday physical activities like yard work. You’ll also be able to enjoy yourself more if you end up doing physical activities for fun, like going on a hike or walking around a new city when you travel.\n\nSo now you know that lifting will benefit your ability to cardio activities, and cardio will benefit your lifting. There are also definitely activities that combine both. (If you do Crossfit, for example, or strongman training, you may well have most of your bases covered.) But for simplicity, the physical activity guidelines for Americans break out the two different types.\n\nThese guidelines (which agree with those from other major public health organizations) suggest at least 20-30 minutes of strength training, at least twice a week. Most beginner lifting programs will have you work out three times a week, which is great. The minimum is two sessions for each muscle group, so if you prefer to do split your workout into upper-body and lower-body days, make sure you to two of each. If you work your full body in each strength training day, you only need two or three of those workouts per week.\n\nAs you get used to strength training, you may want to do more—which is great, as long as you work up to it gradually. While you can do one-off videos or make up a routine out of exercises you like, you’re better off in the long run with a program that gives you a way to progress as you get stronger. There are some great listings of programs at the subreddits r/fitness and r/bodyweightfitness, if you’d like a few to choose from.\n\nFor cardiovascular exercise, the recommended minimum is 150 minutes of light exercise like walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise. So if you take a 30-minute walk every weekday at lunchtime, you’ll meet the guidelines. If you use that time to run instead, you’ll exceed the guidelines within three sessions. While the guidelines use minutes of exercise, researchers have calculated that if you prefer step counting, 7,000 to 9,000 steps will get you in the right ballpark.\n\nAgain, more is better, so long as you work up to it over time. I started working an evening walk into my routine one summer, and once the weather started to cool down I went for a lunchtime walk and an evening walk. Then, little by little, I replaced some of the evening walks with run/walk sessions, and eventually runs. I felt like my lifting sessions went better than they did before, but I was also happy to know I’m setting myself up for better health in the long term than if I just stuck with one type of exercise.",

    "title": "Meta Is Taking VR Out of 'Horizon Worlds'",
    "description": "But where will all the legless avatars go?",
    "fullText": "Meta just announced a seismic change to its 3D social platform Horizon Worlds. The company is removing Meta Quest users to focus on mobile users. So Horizon Worlds, originally a VR-only platform, now a mix of both VR users and mobile users, will become a mobile-only platform in the near future. In a blog post aimed at developers, Samantha Ryan, VP of Content at Meta's Reality Labs, said the company is \"separating our Quest VR platform from our Worlds platform in order to create more space for both products to grow.\"\n\n\"We’re doubling down on the VR developer ecosystem while shifting the focus of Worlds to be almost exclusively mobile. By breaking things down into two distinct platforms, we’ll be better able to clearly focus on each,\" Ryan wrote.\n\nAnnounced in 2019 as a \"social VR world\" called Facebook Horizon, the platform was renamed Horizon Worlds two years later and was an integral part of Meta's vision of a future \"Metaverse,\" but Worlds never really caught on with users. Despite the money Facebook/Meta clearly devoted to the platform, its monthly user count was only around 200,000 in 2022.\n\nAccording to Ryan, 86% of time people spend in their VR headsets is spent with third-party apps, so it's not surprising that Meta would pull back from first-party VR. Last month, the company shuttered its three AAA VR game development companies, stopped updating its first-party subscription-based fitness app Supernatural, and laid off around 10% of its Reality Labs division. Ryan says Meta will continue supporting third-party VR developers and releasing hardware, promising the company has \"robust roadmap of future VR headsets\" tailored to \"different audience segments\" on tap, but offered no specific details as yet.\n\nWhile the change marks a definitive end to Horizon Worlds as a VR-first destination, the company plans to leverage the massive user base of Meta's Instagram and Facebook to make Worlds competitive with social platforms like Roblox. The company reports 4x growth in Horizon mobile users in 2025.\"We’re in a strong position to deliver synchronous social games at scale,\" Ryan wrote.\n\nThere are around five billion smart phone users worldwide, all potential customers to Worlds, compared to an estimated 20-30 million Quest users, so the math definitely makes sense in terms of growing a platform and stock price, but it's sad for the (relatively few) people who have found a home on Horizon Worlds. They'll be able to use mobile platform, but it isn't the same: the sense of scale and engagement can't be replicated on a small, 2D screen. I recently spent a lot of time looking for life in the VR version of Worlds, and it's a unique place, an undiscovered country where strange little communities have taken up residence in a massive, deserted shopping mall. If you can, strap on a headset and poke around a little before the plug is pulled.",

    "description": "Multitasking in Chrome just got a whole lot better.",
    "fullText": "While I generally consider Chrome to be a mature, feature complete browser, it's great to see that Google is still making meaningful additions to it. With its latest update, Google Chrome for desktop now has three new productivity features: Split View, PDF annotations, and the ability to save downloads directly to Google Drive. These features are targeted at both regular and enterprise users, the company says, so you don't need to worry about Workspace exclusivity. Let's take a look at each new feature and how you can best use it.\n\nOver the years, the internet browser has become a super app of sorts, since it has access to so many useful sites and web apps. In Chrome, I often find myself taking notes while attending meetings online, or keeping a second tab open for research while I write articles. For many people, a single Chrome tab or window is no longer enough, and with that in mind, Google's added Split View to the desktop version of its browser.\n\nSplit View merges two tabs and displays them in the same window. You can think of it like the split-screen view in old school video games. You can use Split View by right-clicking any tab and selecting Add Tab to New Split View. For now, Chrome allows you to have a maximum of two tabs side by side in Split View, although I hope you'll eventually be able to add \n\nYou can easily drag the slider in between the two tabs to give one tab more screen space than the other. Or for more control, you can click the Split View button to the left of the address bar and select the Arrange Split View menu (this is also available if you right click the merged tabs in your tab bar). This is an easy way to quickly reverse the order of the two tabs, separate them, or close just one of the tabs.\n\nLet's be honest: Chrome is probably the PDF viewer that most people use. No matter how many fancy PDF editing apps I or my colleagues recommend, for the most part, you're going to search for and open PDFs in your browser. Luckily, now you no longer have to use a different app for basic annotations. Chrome's desktop PDF Viewer now has tools for highlighting text, adding notes, and even making digital signatures. You're still going to need a different app for advanced PDF edits, but Chrome is now capable enough to handle the basics.\n\nWhenever you download a PDF file using Google Chrome, it defaults to saving them to the Downloads folder on your computer, or to another location on your hard drive. On desktop, Google now lets you save these files directly to your Google Drive account. This can be very useful if you want to keep your local storage clear. When you open a PDF file in Chrome, you'll see a Google Drive icon in the toolbar, next to the download button. Clicking the Google Drive icon will automatically save it to the cloud storage service, in a new folder called \"Saved from Chrome.\"",

    "description": "New members can see up to 100 recent messages.",
    "fullText": "From coordinating pickups for road trips to helping organize yard sales, WhatsApp groups are at the center of all kinds of events in people's daily lives. As someone who's a member of far too many WhatsApp groups, I've always been very annoyed by the app's inability to show group chat history to new group chat members. In the lead up to my most recent meditation retreat, the admins ended up sending the same document seven (!) times, just because new members kept joining the group and they had no way to access attachments that were previously sent to the group chat. Thankfully, WhatsApp is finally changing that.\n\nWhatsApp is finally adding a feature called Group Message History, which means that group admins and members can now choose to share recent messages with new members. Now, when adding new members to a WhatsApp group, you'll be able to let them access up to 100 recent messages already sent to the rest of the group chat, which should good enough to stop people from spamming the group with the same messages as new people are added.\n\nSpeaking personally, this will be a great quality of life upgrade. In order to help new group chat members feel less lost, I've previously done everything from forwarding all relevant messages to them via DMs to sending screenshots of all our previous messages. All of this is incredibly tedious, and thankfully, I won't have to do it for much longer.\n\nI also like the idea of limiting new group members to 100 recent messages or less. Quite often, my WhatsApp groups start off with a small number of people who know each other extremely well, and then the group expands to add acquaintances. The dynamics of the group chat change significantly when newer members are added, and not everyone feels comfortable with the idea of an unknown person seeing messages that were sent with a more intimate group in mind. Limiting chat history is a great move that allows people to maintain some privacy, as opposed to sharing the group's entire chat history with every new member.\n\nStill, if 100 messages seems like too much of an invasion of privacy to you, WhatsApp also says that admins will have the option to disable this feature for regular members. This way, only the admin will be able to share chat history with new members.\n\nThe company says that everyone in the group chat will be notified when a new member is granted access to chat history, so you won't be blindsided if your new group member starts referring to in-jokes from a few days ago.\n\nWhatsApp says it is gradually rolling out this feature across the world, so you can expect it to be available on your device in the coming weeks.",

    "title": "Now That Trump's Tariffs Have Been Ruled Illegal, Will Tech Prices Lower?",
    "description": "It's not clear whether prices will come down now that these tariffs are ending.",
    "fullText": "It's official: Most of President Trump's tariffs are illegal. The Supreme Court struck down the president's signature economic orders on Friday in a 6-3 ruling, spelling the end of a controversial policy that added an estimated $1,000 tax increase for each American household, raised prices on consumer goods, and alienated key U.S. allies.\n\nNot all of Trump's tariffs need to end because of this ruling. The court acknowledged that presidents have the power to \"unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope.\" Instead, the court found that tariffs enacted based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) were done so improperly, as the administration \"points to no statute\" from Congress that says the IEEPA could be used for tariffs. That means tariffs against steel and aluminum could continue, since those were enacted from other laws, but both the \"reciprocal\" tariffs placed against other countries, and the flat 25% tariff placed on goods from countries like Canada, China, and Mexico, cannot currently stand.\n\nThat raises a lot of questions. Will the Trump administration seek to impose these tariffs through other means, avoiding the IEEPA altogether? Will companies that have paid tariffs already get their money back? And, perhaps most pressing to the average consumer, will prices for common goods, like tech, finally come down?\n\nThere's no clear answer to this one, since there's really no precedent here. Trump is the first president to use the IEEPA as a reasoning to enact tariffs, and, as such, this is an enormous flip-flop that doesn't have a previous framework to look back to.\n\nThe reason tariffs are inflationary, or raise prices on goods, is because they make it more expensive for U.S. companies to import foreign goods. People can confuse this point: Tariffs place a tax on the importer of a good, not necessarily the manufacturer of that good. When a company exports its products to the U.S. with a tariff in place, it does not directly pay the tariff: The company that imports those products pays. As a result, importers raise their prices to compensate. Look at Nintendo: The company raised its original MSRPs for Switch 2 accessories like the Pro Controller and Joy-Con 2, as well as the original Switch, in the wake of tariffs. As these products cost more to import to the U.S., prices go up to give the company a cushion. It could've been worse, too, since Nintendo didn't raise the price of the Switch 2 or its games—though there's no telling whether those MSRPs were set with tariffs in mind, too.\n\nAs such, you might expect that if these tariffs disappear, these prices will come down. If Nintendo felt the need to raise Pro Controller prices by $15 in response to tariffs, it might reverse course now that Trump's tax is no longer placing a burden on U.S. importers. While anything's possible, I don't think it's very likely. For many goods, prices can rise quickly, especially with factors like tariffs, but can take a long time to fall—if at all. Some economists think that ending tariffs would cause prices to rise slower, but not stop: a disinflationary effect, rather than deflationary.\n\nWe the consumer may be to blame. If companies raise prices in response to tariffs, and consumers continue to buy those products regardless, it shows that the market supports those prices. The consumer doesn't necessarily see the impact of the tariff going away, so why lower prices? It's only in that company's best interest anyway, since they'll sell goods at higher prices without paying the tariff tax. If the company was struggling to sell inflated goods, perhaps prices will come down: If Nintendo is selling far fewer Switch units following its tariff increases, maybe it'll cut the price back down to encourage sales. But it's truly difficult to say without being on the inside.\n\nThen, of course, there are the forces at play that push prices north besides tariffs. Computer components come to mind, particularly RAM. These components are becoming more expensive—and harder to find—not necessarily because of tariffs, but because AI companies are scooping them up for data processing. All of a sudden, everything that runs on these components is at risk of rising in price, since one section of the market has such a high demand. It doesn't matter if RAM is cheaper to import next month after tariffs are gone, if there's no RAM left to buy.\n\nThat means your gaming consoles, laptops, smart displays, cars—anything that runs on RAM, GPUs, and CPUs—could rise in price, unless more components can be made to meet demand. SCOTUS might've taken the burden of tariffs away from these imports, but it might not bring prices down, or, worse yet, do anything to stop them skyrocketing. Micron, the only American-based producer of RAM, didn't think memory shortages would end this year, even ahead of the tariff news. The company is investing in more facilities to produce components, but that takes time, which means price increases could continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nWe can speculate all day about how the end of these tariffs will affect prices, but it's just that: speculation. Companies will do what they're going to do with the prices, and there's nothing in the Supreme Court's ruling to tell us whether our iPhones, Switches, or Echos are going to be cheaper later this year or not. Prices could plummet, come down slightly, stay the same, go up slowly, or go up quickly. My best guess is that the average consumer product previously affected by these tariffs will stay about the same price it is now, barring some other major change in the markets—but again, that's just a guess.\n\nAs such, my advice is to make your purchase decisions based on other, more stable factors: Research the products you're interested in to determine which has the best value; compare prices across different stores, both in-person and online; wait for traditional sales events if you're looking for major deals.\n\nThe most concrete risk of price increases right now comes from that computer-component shortage. If you've been in the market for a new computer, or a device that relies heavily on these components (like gaming consoles), it might be a good time to buy. Prices can easily go up, but take a long time to come back down.",

    "description": "Snapseed now comes with a fully fledged camera app inside it.",
    "fullText": "Google acquired the excellent photo editor Snapseed back in 2012—not long after Apple had crowned it one of its apps of the year—and despite having plenty to offer and being completely free to use, it remains one of Google's lesser-known apps. That might be about to change. Snapseed's latest update for iOS, version 3.15.0, comes with a full camera app inside—and there's a case to be made that it's better than Apple's default Camera app. It certainly offers \n\nOnce you've installed or updated Snapseed to the latest version, you'll see the new camera icon up in the top right corner. While you can start your session by opening up an existing image as always, you can also opt to capture a new one by tapping here:\n\nIf you want an easier way to launch the camera, you can add it to the Lock Screen: Press and hold on your iPhone's display when it's locked, tap \"Customize,\" then pick a shortcut spot and choose \"Camera\" under \"Snapseed.\" There's also a Control Center shortcut you can make use of, if you prefer.\n\nOnce you've swiped through the introductory spiel and given Snapseed access to your iPhone's camera, you'll need to pick one of the classic camera film presets to get started, though you can adjust the look of your shots afterwards. There are 11 different film simulations available—emulating film from Kodak, Fuji, Agfa, Polaroid, and Technicolor—and each one gives you slightly different variations in terms of color, contrast, texture, and tone. You can tap the film selector at the bottom of the camera interface (designed to look like a rewind button) to change at any time.\n\nYour saved looks and edits are also included in the film selector, and can be used as preset filters for the images you're capturing. In the main image editor, after you've applied whatever adjustments you want to a photo, you can tap Looks > Add look to save it and access it through the camera.\n\nUp in the top left corner of the camera interface, you'll find a Pro toggle switch, which gives you some controls the default iPhone camera does not. You get three new settings on screen, for ISO, shutter speed, and focus, and you can change any of them by selecting a setting and using the dial underneath. You've also got controls for flash (left) and zoom (right). Besides the big shutter button, you have a camera swap button (lower right), a button for going back to your photo library (lower left), and a camera capture screen theme button (upper right). Tap on this to pick a different color scheme for the screen.\n\nYou're not stuck with the look of any of the photos you shoot through Snapseed: All of the changes applied by your film preset, from exposure to curves, can be changed later on. Select your picture from the main library screen, then use the Faves and Tools tabs to make changes.\n\nMost filters and effects are applied by adjusting a slider underneath your image. The layers button (two squares) at the top gives you access to the current editing stack, and there's also an undo button to the left. When you're happy with what you've made, you're able to save over your existing image or make a copy.\n\nIt's an interesting new addition to the selection of superb third-party camera apps available for the iPhone, and yet another alternative to the Apple default. Meanwhile, Android users are within their rights to feel left out by all this: Snapseed for Android hasn't been updated since May 2024, and lacks both the camera feature and the most recent editing interface revamp that are now available on iPhones.",

    "fullText": "Compilers occupy a special place in computer science. They're a canonical course in computer science education. Building one is a rite of passage. It forces you to confront how software actually works, by examining languages, abstractions, hardware, and the boundary between human intent and machine execution.\n\nCompilers once helped humans speak to machines. Now machines are beginning to help humans build compilers.\n\nI’ve spent a large part of my career working on compilers and programming languages, so when Anthropic announced the Claude C Compiler (CCC), I paid close attention. My basic take is simple: this is real progress, a milestone for the industry. We’re not in the end of times, but this also isn’t just hype, so take a deep breath, everyone.\n\nAI building a C compiler is not truly revolutionary, but it does reveal how far AI coding has progressed and where it may be heading next.\n\nBefore diving in, here are my main take-aways:\n\nThe implications for engineering teams are real and immediate. At the end, I share how I'm translating these insights into concrete expectations for my team at Modular.\n\nTo understand why the Claude C Compiler matters, we must first understand why compilers themselves are such a revealing test of intelligence, whether human or artificial.\n\nA compiler sits at the intersection of multiple difficult domains at once: formal language design, large-scale software architecture, deep performance constraints, and unforgiving correctness requirements.\n\nMost applications can tolerate bugs, compilers cannot. A single incorrect transformation can silently produce wrong programs, disrupting the productivity of countless users. Every layer must maintain strict invariants while cooperating with every other layer.\n\nHistorically, this is why compilers became a rite of passage in computer science education. They force engineers to think across abstraction layers: turning text into structure, structure into meaning, meaning into optimized machine behavior.\n\nThat process mirrors something deeper, which is the process of translating human intent into precise execution, which is why compilers are a uniquely interesting benchmark for AI system integration.\n\nEarlier generations of AI coding tools were impressive at local tasks, such as writing functions, generating scripts, or filling in missing pieces of code. Those tasks test pattern recognition and short-term reasoning.\n\nThe Claude C Compiler is a milestone, showing progress at a different level. It shows an AI system maintaining coherence across an entire engineering system that can coordinate multiple subsystems, preserve architectural structure, iterate toward correctness over time, and operate within a complex feedback loop of tests and failures. AI is beginning to move from code completion toward engineering participation.\n\nHowever, the deeper reason compilers align unusually well with modern AI systems is that compiler engineers build architectures that are highly legible and structured. Compilers have layered abstractions, consistent naming conventions, composable passes, and deterministic feedback (“it works” or “it doesn’t” - there is a clear success criteria). These properties make compilers unusually learnable for both humans and machine learning systems trained on large amounts of source code.\n\nSeen this way, CCC is validation of decades of software engineering practice. The abstractions developed by compiler engineers turned out to be structured enough that machines can now reason within them. That is a remarkable milestone. However, it also hints at an important limitation.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the Claude C Compiler is that Anthropic released the full source history. Unlike many AI demonstrations, this is an engineering artifact that anyone can inspect, not simply a polished result or benchmark score. The entire repository, including commit history, design documents, and future plans, is available. That means we can actually study how the system approached building a compiler. I spent some time doing exactly that.\n\nThe first major commit effectively “one-shots” the basic architecture of the system. From the start, CCC follows a classic compiler structure. Major subsystems all have pretty amazing design docs too, including:\n\nThe design choices throughout the repository consistently reflect well-established compiler practice - things taught in a university class and widely used by existing compilers like LLVM and GCC. The intermediate representation includes concepts that will look immediately familiar to LLVM developers, including instructions like GetElementPtr, basic block “terminators” and Mem2Reg. It appears to have strong knowledge of widely-used compiler design techniques.\n\nLLVM and GCC code are clearly part of the training set - Claude effectively translated large swaths of them into Rust for CCC. The design docs show detailed knowledge of both systems, as well as considered takes on its implementation approach. Some have criticized CCC for learning from this prior art, but I find that ridiculous - I certainly learned from GCC when building Clang!\n\nPushpendre Rastogi wrote a great blog post about CCC and agent scaling laws, showing how iterative agent workflows gradually expanded implementation and test coverage:\n\nTaken together, CCC looks less like an experimental research compiler and more like a competent textbook implementation, the sort of system a strong undergraduate team might build early in a project before years of refinement. That alone is remarkable.\n\nThe most revealing parts of CCC are its mistakes. Several design choices suggest optimization toward passing tests rather than building general abstractions like a human would. A few examples:\n\nThis last issue is the big problem that indicates CCC won’t be able to generalize well beyond its test-suite, which appears to be confirmed by its bug tracker. These flaws are informative rather than surprising, suggesting that current AI systems excel at assembling known techniques and optimizing toward measurable success criteria, while struggling with the open-ended generalization required for production-quality systems.\n\nAnd that observation leads directly to the deeper question: what does this tell us about AI coding itself?\n\nThe most interesting lesson from the Claude C Compiler is not that AI can build a compiler. It’s how it built one. CCC didn’t invent a new architecture or explore an unfamiliar design space. Instead, it reproduced something strikingly close to the accumulated consensus of decades of compiler engineering: structurally correct, familiar, and grounded in well-understood techniques.\n\nModern LLMs are extraordinarily powerful distribution followers. They learn patterns across vast bodies of existing work and generate solutions near the center of that collective experience. When trained on decades of compilers shaped by GCC, LLVM, and academic literature, it is entirely natural that the result reflects that lineage. This phenomenon closely aligns with Richard Sutton’s Bitter Lesson, where scalable methods rediscover broadly successful structures.\n\nAn analogy helps. Training on English literature allows a model to produce Shakespearean prose: not because literature stopped evolving in the 1600s. Instead, it’s because Shakespeare occupies a dense region of the training distribution. Models learn what has been widely written and reinforced. The same dynamic appears here in compiler design (of all things, rawr! 🐉).\n\nCCC shows that AI systems can internalize the textbook knowledge of a field and apply it coherently at scale. AI can now reliably operate within established engineering practice. This is a genuine milestone that removes much of the drudgery of repetition and allows engineers to start closer to the state of the art. But it also highlights an important limitation of this work:\n\nImplementing known abstractions is not the same as inventing new ones. I see nothing novel in this implementation.\n\nHistorically, progress in compilers did not come from assembling standard components quickly. It came from conceptual leaps, e.g. new intermediate representations, new optimization models, new ways of structuring programs and hardware interaction. It came from getting groups of people to work together, which required inspiring and motivating engineers in new ways.\n\nCurrent AI coding systems excel when success criteria are clear and verifiable: compile the program, pass the tests, improve performance. In these environments, iterative refinement works extremely well: red/green TDD works! Innovation is different. When inventing a new abstraction, success is not yet measurable. There is no test suite for an idea that does not exist, and good design is hard to quantify.\n\nAs writing code is becoming easier, designing software becomes more important than ever. As custom software becomes cheaper to create, the real challenge becomes choosing the right problems and managing the resulting complexity. I also see big open questions about who is going to maintain all this software.\n\nThe Claude C Compiler also raises important yet uncomfortable questions about intellectual property. If AI systems trained on decades of publicly available code can reproduce familiar structures, patterns, and even specific implementations, where exactly is the boundary between learning and copying? Some observers have pointed out cases where CCC appears to regenerate artifacts strongly resembling existing implementations, including standard headers and utility code, despite claims of “clean room” development. These examples highlight how current legal frameworks struggle to describe systems that learn statistically from vast prior work rather than explicitly referencing source material.\n\nAt the same time, this situation is not new. Humans learn by studying existing systems, internalizing patterns, and reapplying ideas in new contexts. The difference is scale and automation. AI compresses decades of engineering knowledge into a generative model capable of reproducing solutions instantly. That challenges traditional assumptions about ownership when the underlying ideas are widely shared but specific expressions may still carry licenses.\n\nWe are facing a new era of automated reimplementation of proprietary software, but this doesn’t mean the paradigm is suddenly obsolete. AI lowers the cost of reproducing established designs, which will shift competitive advantage away from isolated codebases and toward execution, ecosystems, and continuous innovation. This will force legal and institutional norms to evolve, similar to when Linux and open source software first gained wide-spread adoption. Just as with those transitions, I am betting that we will see ecosystem gravity from human collaboration replace legacy ecosystems that cannot keep pace with rapidly changing times.\n\nIf AI coding primarily automates implementation, what happens next?\n\nHistory gives us a clear pattern: when the cost of building something drops dramatically, we don’t simply build the same things more cheaply. We build entirely new things.\n\nCompilers themselves are a perfect example. Early programmers wrote assembly by hand, but once compilers became reliable, developers became vastly more ambitious and entire industries emerged because abstraction made complexity manageable. As writing code becomes easier, the likely outcome is not fewer programmers but more software. We will get more experimentation, more specialized tools, and solutions to problems that previously weren’t worth automating.\n\nWhat changes is the economics of engineering work and particularly the large-scale elimination of mechanical tasks like rewrites, migrations, and boilerplate implementation. These activities are necessary but rarely innovative, and AI systems are unusually good at exactly this kind of work. Engineers move from typing implementations toward directing systems: specifying intent, validating outcomes, and shaping architecture.\n\nAs implementation becomes cheaper, the role of engineers shifts upward. The scarce skills become choosing the right abstractions, defining meaningful problems, and designing systems that humans and AI can evolve together. This will increasingly blur the boundary between software engineering and product thinking. The limiting factor is no longer whether software can be built, but deciding what should be built and how to manage the complexity that follows. AI amplifies both good and bad structure, so we can expect to see poorly managed code scale into incomprehensible nightmares.\n\nThat raises the next question: if programming is changing this fundamentally, what happens to software engineers themselves?\n\nEvery major shift in software development has changed what it means to be a programmer. Early engineers managed hardware directly, while later generations learned to trust compilers and higher-level languages. Each transition removed manual work while raising expectations for what engineers could accomplish, and AI coding represents the next step in that progression.\n\nAs implementation grows increasingly automated, the core skill of software engineering shifts away from writing code line-by-line and toward shaping systems. Engineers can focus on deciding what should exist, how components fit together, and how complexity remains understandable over time. Good software depends on judgment, communication, and clear abstraction. AI systems amplify these human qualities, rather than replacing them.\n\nThe most effective engineers will not compete with AI at producing code, but will learn to collaborate with it, by using AI to explore ideas faster, iterate more broadly, and focus human effort on direction and design. These tools are rapidly becoming part of the normal software development stack, much like compilers, version control, or continuous integration before them. Learning to work effectively with AI is quickly becoming a core professional skill. Ignoring AI today would be like refusing to adopt source control twenty years ago.\n\nThe gap between teams successfully embracing AI tooling and those that aren't is already measurable and widening fast. According to CircleCI's 2026 State of Software Delivery Report, the top 5% of engineering teams nearly doubled their output year-over-year, while the bottom half stagnated. The most productive team in 2025 delivered roughly 10x the throughput of 2024's leader.\n\nWhich raises a practical question: how should teams adapt to be successful?\n\nHere's how I'm translating this shift into concrete expectations for Modular.\n\nDevelopments like the Claude C Compiler have changed how I think about engineering work and what I now ask from my team. Fully benefiting from AI tools requires a deliberate leap: habits formed over decades don’t change automatically, and organizations rarely transform just because better tools exist.\n\nAt the same time, we need to be pragmatic. AI systems are powerful but far from perfect. Progress comes from collaboration with AI, not abdication to it. The goal is not to remove humans from the loop, but to move humans into higher-leverage positions inside it.\n\nThat leads to three expectations:\n\nEvery employee, from engineering to G&A and GTM, is expected to actively adopt AI tools to accelerate productivity and decision-making. The world is moving quickly, and we must lean into change.\n\nCrucially, this does not transfer responsibility to the tool. For example, engineers building large-scale production software remain accountable for correctness, design quality, and long-term maintainability. AI expands our capabilities, but it does not outsource judgment. Work produced with AI should be understood, validated, and owned just as deeply as work written by hand. Reputation is still built on outcomes, not prompts.\n\nA large fraction of historical engineering effort has gone into mechanical work: rewriting code, adapting interfaces, migrating systems, and reproducing existing patterns in new environments. AI is rapidly becoming better at these tasks than humans. We should not compete with automation at mechanical work. Instead, engineers should clarify intent with rigor, validate outcomes with tests, and improve their design.\n\nHuman effort should concentrate where creativity and judgment matter most: and all engineers now have management responsibilities. As migration and implementation accelerate, architectural evolution is no longer limited by how fast humans can rewrite software, but by how clearly we can define where systems should go next.\n\nWell-documented systems become dramatically easier to extend and evolve, and poorly structured systems scale into confusion faster than ever. Documentation, clear interfaces, and explicit design intent are now operational leverage, not optional overhead.\n\nAs implementation costs approach zero, the scarce resource shifts from writing code to aligning people. The greatest opportunity lies in building communities of like-minded people that collaborate toward shared goals and ecosystems where developers can move forward together instead of repeatedly rebuilding the past.\n\nFor my team, that means focusing on tools and platforms that help other developers succeed: systems that move existing code forward, unlock modern compute, and enable collaboration between humans and AI. This aligns directly with Modular’s mission to Democratize AI Compute and expand what programmers everywhere can create.\n\nThe Claude C Compiler doesn’t mark the end of software or compiler engineering. If anything, it opens the door wider. The easier implementation gets, the more room there is for genuine innovation.\n\nLower barriers to implementation do not reduce the importance of engineers; instead, they elevate the importance of vision, judgment, and taste. When creation becomes easier, deciding what is worth creating becomes the harder problem. AI accelerates execution, but meaning, direction, and responsibility remain fundamentally human.\n\nWriting code has never been the goal. Building meaningful software is. The future belongs to teams willing to embrace new tools, challenge assumptions, and design systems that help people create together.\n\nThat is the future that has driven Modular’s mission from the start, and the one I believe this new era of AI makes possible.\n\nWant to build the AI future with us? Modular is hiring.",

    "fullText": "If there are two tech things you’re going to read a lot about in the coming year, it’s vibe coding and smart glasses, and lucky for you, you now get to read about both simultaneously. Thanks to a software engineer, Jake Ledner, the buzziest AI agent, OpenClaw, has now found a new friend in Meta’s flagship smart glasses, the Meta Ray-Ban Display. Instead of buying things on Amazon for you, though, OpenClaw is here to help you vibe code while you take a little stroll through Wall Street.\n\nI’m building apps directly from my glasses 🤯\nOpenClaw + Meta Ray-Ban Display pic.twitter.com/0WtBJ85gAK\n\n— Jake Ledner (@jake_ledner) February 19, 2026\n\nIn a demonstration on X, Ledner shows how he connected OpenClaw, which is running on a Mac Studio in his apartment, to the Meta Ray-Ban Display, using OpenAI’s Codex tool to build apps with voice inputs. Because of the in-lens screen on the Meta Ray-Ban Display, Ledner can actually see the progress of the vibe coding session. For demo purposes, Ledner uses the setup to vibe code parts of a health-tracking app called “TrackGPT,” which sounds like exactly what you’d do with smart glasses that churn out apps for you.\n\nLedner even brings the whole thing a step further. Using his voice, he asks OpenClaw to code the feature but also to actually push the whole thing to a live app—a task it appears to complete in the demo. Welcome to the future of coding, I guess? As long as you’re okay with cranking out app slop.\n\nWhile Ledner’s demo is pretty impressive from a technical standpoint, it’s not the only example of experimentation in cramming OpenClaw and Meta’s smart glasses together. Just last week, I covered how one software engineer hacked the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses to buy things on Amazon by just looking at an object and asking the AI agent to add it to his cart. Again, the whole thing is interesting, but it probably isn’t something you should try for yourself right now.\n\nHowever useful OpenClaw may be, it’s also a pretty huge security risk. For a more technical breakdown of the risks OpenClaw poses, you can read this Medium post from author Vishal Rajput, but the long and short of it is that OpenClaw—in order to do useful stuff—requires access to some of the most sensitive data, including passwords, browser history, and cookies, as well as files and folders on your machine. The security risks are so great that one cybersecurity firm, Palo Alto Networks, went as far as to say that OpenClaw constitutes a “lethal trifecta” of security risks.\n\nIn any case, people seem to be down to experiment with AI agents on smart glasses, regardless, so I would buckle up for even more mashing of OpenClaw and smart glasses in the future—for better and most likely worse.",

    "fullText": "How do labs train a frontier, multi-billion parameter model? We look towards seven open-weight frontier models: Hugging Face’s SmolLM3, Prime Intellect’s Intellect 3, Nous Research’s Hermes 4, OpenAI’s gpt-oss-120b, Moonshot’s Kimi K2, DeepSeek’s DeepSeek-R1, and Arcee’s Trinity series. This blog is an attempt at distilling the techniques, motivations, and considerations used to train their models with an emphasis on training methodology over infrastructure.\n\nThese notes are largely structured based on Hugging Face’s SmolLM3 report due to its extensiveness, and it is currently supplemented with notes from other reports including Intellect-3, gpt-oss-120b, Hermes 4, DeepSeek, and Kimi. While this blog explores some infrastructure-related ideas like in-flight weight updates and multi-client orchestrators, there are many other ideas mentioned throughout those posts/blogs like expert parallelism and quantization. Hugging Face writes more about gpt-oss-120b’s infrastructure here.\n\nArchitecture decisions fundamentally determine a model’s efficiency, capabilities, and training dynamics. Model families like DeepSeek, gpt-oss-120b, Kimi, and SmolLM have vastly different architectures (dense vs MoE), attention mechanisms (MHA vs MLA vs GQA), position encodings (RoPE, partial RoPE, NoPE), among many others. Not all information about the models is publicly available, so some are chosen:\n\nWhen choosing architecture, Hugging Face suggests following a decision tree such that if one of these is true, choose a dense architecture:\n\nMulti-head attention (MHA) uses separate query, key, and value projections for each attention head, but this creates a large KV-cache that becomes an inference bottleneck and GPU memory hoarder. To address this, researchers developed multi-query attention (MQA) and grouped query attention (GQA). In MQA, KV values are shared across all heads, but this comes at a cost of leaking attention capacity because heads can’t store information specialized to each head’s role. GQA softens this issue by sharing KV values across a small group of heads (e.g. 4). Another alternative is multi-latent attention (MLA) which stores a compressed latent variable that can be decompressed/projected into KV values at runtime. The latent variable is typically much smaller than the full KV cache (often achieving 4-8x compression), and this results in a KV-cache parameter count more comparable to GQA while maintaining performance stronger than MQA.\n\nWhen ablating (for variables that change the parameter count such as changing MHA to GQA, they occasionally adjust other hyperparameters to keep model sizes roughly the same), Hugging Face found that GQA with small groups (2/4/8) outperformed MHA in their ablations and that MHA outperformed MQA and GQA with 16 groups. Across benchmarks like HellaSwag, MMLU, and ARC, GQA with 2/4/8 groups performed best in their experiments.\n\nGated attention applies an elementwise gating mechanism to the scaled dot-product attention output before the output projection. A gate vector $\\mathbf{g}_t = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}^G \\mathbf{x}_t)$ is computed from the input, where $\\mathbf{x}_t$ is the input at position $t$, $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, and $\\mathbf{W}^G$ is a learned gate projection matrix. This gate is split across $h_q$ attention heads (where $h_q$ is the number of query heads), and each head’s attention output is elementwise multiplied by its corresponding gate segment: $\\tilde{\\mathbf{o}}_{t,i} = \\mathbf{o}^{\\text{sdpa}}_{t,i} \\odot \\mathbf{g}_{t,i}$ where $\\mathbf{o}^{\\text{sdpa}}_{t,i}$ represents the scaled dot-product attention output for head $i$ at position $t$, $\\odot$ denotes elementwise multiplication, and $\\mathbf{g}_{t,i}$ is the gate segment for head $i$. The gated outputs are then concatenated and projected through the output matrix $\\mathbf{W}^O$ to produce the final output.\n\nGated attention reduces attention sinks (tokens receiving disproportionately high attention), reduces large activations that destabilize training, and improves performance on evaluations and long-sequence generalization. Critically, it stabilizes training and reduces loss spikes, making it valuable for large-scale training.\n\nWhen pre-training, a common consideration is fixed sequence lengths since training uses tensors of the form [batch, sequence length, hidden], so with regards to batching and distributed training, GPUs are most happy when every example has the same sequence length. But due to variable document length and wanting to avoid padding which wastes compute, packing enables shuffling and concatenating documents within the same sequence to achieve the sequence length.\n\nCausal masking means that for unrelated files $A$ and $B$ in the same batch, the tokens in $B$ can attend to the tokens in $A$, which degrades performance. With intra-document masking, the attention mask is modified so tokens can only attend to previous tokens within the same document. Many papers have found benefits relating to long-context extension and some short context benchmarks as well as shortening the average context length.\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of causal masking (left) and intra-document masking (right). Causal masking allows tokens to attend to all preceding tokens regardless of document boundaries, while intra-document masking restricts attention to tokens within the same document. From @PMinervini.\n\nWhen implementing document masking, Hugging Face saw small improvements on PIQA but otherwise no noticeable impact on short context tasks. But in line with aforementioned research, they observed that it became crucial for scaling from 4k to 64k tokens.\n\nThe decision of whether to use intra-document attention masking can depend on model scale. For smaller models, some implementations choose to omit intra-document masking, finding that the additional complexity and potential reduction in cross-document learning doesn’t justify the benefits at those scales. However, for larger models, intra-document masking becomes more critical as the model’s capacity to learn from cross-document attention patterns diminishes relative to the benefits of cleaner document boundaries.\n\nInput embeddings (token-to-vector lookup) and output embeddings (hidden states to vocab logits) are typically represented as separate matrices, so the total embedding parameters are $2 \\times \\text{vocab size} \\times \\text{hidden dim}$. In small language models, this can account for up to 20% of total parameters, as is the case with Llama 3.2 1B (in larger models, the embeddings represent a much smaller fraction of the parameter count, only 3% in Llama 3.1 70B). The issue with tying them is that input/output embeddings still represent different geometries, and frequent tokens like “the” can dominate representation learning due to getting gradients from both the input stream and the predicted output.\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of untied embeddings (separate input and output matrices) vs tied embeddings (shared matrix). Tied embeddings reduce parameter count while maintaining comparable performance. From PyTorch Blog.\n\nHugging Face found that on a 1.2B model, tied embeddings did comparably well despite having 18% fewer parameters (down from 1.46B), and that compared to an untied model also with 1.2B parameters (fewer layers), untied showed higher loss and lower downstream eval scores.\n\nWithout positional encoding, transformers have no sense of word order, akin to the bag of words idea. Initially, absolute position embeddings were used by learning a lookup table that mapped the position index to a vector added to token embeddings, but the maximum input sequence length was limited by the sequence length it was trained on. Relative position encodings followed since capturing distance between tokens matters more than capturing their absolute positions.\n\nThe most commonly used technique is rotary position embedding (RoPE), which encodes position information by rotating query and key vectors in 2D planes. RoPE encodes relative position as rotation angles: based on the dimensionality of the query/key vector, RoPE splits it into pairs (since they rotate in 2D space) and rotates depending on the absolute position of a token and a base frequency. During attention, the dot product between their rotated positions directly encodes their relative distance via the phase difference in their rotation angles, where tokens $x$ positions apart always maintain the same angular relationship.\n\nFigure 3: RoPE splits query/key vectors into pairs and rotates each pair by an angle proportional to position. From Su et al., 2021.\n\nDuring pre-training, models are trained on shorter context lengths (similar ideas to document masking, and quadratic attention is expensive) to learn short range correlation between words. But as sequence length grows, the rotation angles grow via $\\theta= \\text{position} \\times \\frac1{\\text{base}^{\\frac{k}{\\text{dim}/2}}}$. This can be fixed by increasing the base frequency as the sequence length increases using methods like ABF (Adaptive Base Frequency) or YaRN, which applies a more granular interpolation of frequencies on different components and includes other techniques like dynamic attention scaling and temperature adjustment. For extremely long contexts, YaRN does best, and in gpt-oss-120b, it was used to extend the context length of dense layers up to 131k tokens.\n\nMore recently, with the emphasis on long contexts, NoPE (no position embedding) and RNoPE, a hybrid method, have emerged. NoPE uses only causal masking and attention patterns, so it doesn’t bump into the issue of extrapolating beyond training lengths but shows weaker performance on short context reasoning and knowledge-based tasks. RNoPE alternates applying RoPE and NoPE on attention blocks, where RoPE handles local context and NoPE helps with longer-range information retrieval. Another idea is Partial RoPE, which applies RoPE/NoPE within the same layer.\n\nHugging Face ran ablations using RoPE, RNoPE (removing positional encoding every 4th layer), and RNoPE with document masking. They found that all achieve similar performance on short-context tasks, so they adopt RNoPE + document masking because it provides the foundation for long-context handling.\n\nFigure 4: five common types of attention. From Hugging Face.\n\nNote: This section covers attention pattern modifications (which change which tokens can attend to which other tokens). These are distinct from positional encoding scaling methods like ABF/YaRN (discussed in the “positional encodings” section), which adjust how position information is encoded without changing attention patterns. The following methods modify attention patterns to reduce computational cost:\n\nInterleaving local and global attention alternates between layers that use local attention (restricted to nearby tokens) and global attention (full sequence). This pattern balances computational efficiency with the ability to capture both local and long-range dependencies. Local layers reduce quadratic complexity while maintaining local context, and global layers ensure that distant relationships aren’t lost. When training encounters instability or loss spikes, adjusting the ratio of global layers (for example, increasing their frequency) can result in quicker loss recovery, as the model regains access to long-range information that may be crucial for certain patterns. The interleaving strategy is particularly effective for long-context models where full global attention would be computationally prohibitive.\n\nMoEs (mixture of experts), analogous to our brain activating different regions for different tasks, provide an alternative to dense models. At inference, only certain “experts” are activated based on the input, dramatically reducing compute compared to dense models where all parameters are active. The MoE works by replacing the feed forward layer with multiple MLPs (experts) and adding a learnable router before the MLPs to select the experts. The router typically uses top-k gating, selecting the $k$ experts with highest affinity scores for each token, where $k$ is usually much smaller than the total number of experts (e.g., 8 out of 384).\n\nFigure 5: Comparison of dense architecture and MoE architecture. From Sebastian Raschka.\n\nIn general, for fixed number and size of active experts, increasing the total number of experts improves loss, and high sparsity improves performance and benefits more from increasing compute. Recent models are much more sparse, with over 100 experts and around 10 active per token.\n\nTo determine how large each expert should be, a common metric is granularity, defined by $G = 2 \\cdot \\frac{d_\\text{model}}{d_\\text{expert}}$, where a higher granularity corresponds to more experts with a smaller dimension; this can be interpreted as a number proportional to the experts needed to match the dense MLP width. Recent models have granularity anywhere from 2 (gpt-oss-120b) to 8 (qwen3-next-80b-a3b). Ant Group showed that granularity doesn’t significantly change loss but does drive efficiency leverage (the ratio of flops needed for an MoE to achieve the same loss as a dense model). And overall, MoEs present a good alternative to dense models in terms of compute for training and inference.\n\nShared experts are always-on experts, which absorb the basic, recurring patterns so that other experts can more aggressively specialize; one is often enough (DeepSeek-V2 uses two, which adds a bit of complexity).\n\nLoad balancing is crucial in that if it fails, not only do training and inference efficiency plummet, but so do effective learning capacity. The routing mechanism typically uses top-k gating: for each token, the router computes affinity scores (often via a learned linear projection followed by softmax), selects the top $k$ experts, and routes the token to those experts. To ensure balanced expert utilization, this can be addressed by adding a loss-based load balancer (LBL) given by $\\mathcal{L} = \\alpha \\sum_{i=1}^{N_r} f_i P_i$ where $N_r$ is the total number of experts, $\\alpha$ determines the strength of the balancing term, $f_i$ is the fraction of tokens routed to expert $i$, and $P_i$ is the probability mass (average routing probability) for expert $i$; so in perfect load balancing, $f_i=P_i=\\frac1{N_r}$. Also, $\\alpha$ should not be so large that routing uniformity overwhelms the primary training objective. These should be monitored using global statistics, not local statistics which may suffer from a local batch being narrow, biasing the routing statistics.\n\nDeepSeek-V3 does loss-free load balancing differently, by adding a bias term to affinity scores going into the routing softmax.\n\nBeyond bias-based approaches, several other routing and load balancing strategies have emerged. Some implementations use learnable routing functions that adapt during training, while others incorporate expert capacity constraints that prevent any single expert from being overwhelmed. The key insight across these methods is that effective load balancing must operate using global statistics aggregated across multiple batches, as local batch statistics can be misleadingly narrow and bias routing decisions.\n\nSequence-wise auxiliary loss extends traditional auxiliary losses to promote balance within a sequence.\n\nHere, $T$ is the sequence length, $\\alpha$ is a small coefficient, $\\mathbb{1}(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function (which is 1 if its argument is true and 0 otherwise), and $K_r$ is the number of active experts per token.\n\nHere, for each token at each position $t$ in the sequence, each expert $i$ is assigned a routing score $s_{i,t}$, which is normalized so that $\\tilde{s}_{i,t}$ captures the proportion of the routing probability assigned to expert $i$ at position $t$. Averaging this over the whole sequence gives $P_i$, which represents, on average, how often expert $i$ is considered for routing across the sequence. The $f_i$ term furthers this by reflecting the fraction of times expert $i$ is actually selected (i.e., is among the top $K_r$ experts for a token, after bias terms $b_i$ are added). The loss $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Bal}}$ encourages the product $f_i P_i$ to be similar across different experts, pushing the model toward evenly distributing routing decisions and load; if any expert is used much more or less than others, the loss will increase, nudging the model back toward balanced expert activation.\n\nAuxiliary-loss free load balancing methods avoid introducing interference gradients by maintaining a bias vector $\\mathbf{b}=[b_1, \\cdots, b_{N_r}]$ which is updated in a decoupled fashion. Let $n_i$ be the number of tokens routed to expert $i$ in the current step and $\\bar{n}=\\frac1{N_r} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_r} n_i$ the mean load across all experts. $b_i$ is updated by\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the bias update speed, a sort of learning rate. This particular version includes the additional recentering of expert bias updates.\n\nSequence-wise MoE Balancing with Uniformity (SMEBU) load balancing operates at the sequence level rather than the token level, ensuring that expert utilization remains balanced across entire sequences. The normalized per-expert violation is calculated by $v_i=\\frac{\\bar{n}-n_i}{\\bar{n}}$ and $\\tilde{v}_i=\\tanh(\\kappa v_i)$, which makes the scale independent of sequence length and batch size. Then $b_i$ is updated using a momentum buffer with momentum factor $\\beta$:\n\n$\\tanh$ applies the soft-clamping, with tunable scale $\\kappa$ to control saturation speed; $\\tanh$ over $\\text{sign}(\\cdot)$ maintains the continuity and stability needed during training whereas $\\text{sign}$ forces updates to be $\\pm \\lambda$, making the update step oscillate. Momentum also is introduced as a form of noise dampening, analogous to momentum SGD reducing variance in noisy gradient updates\n\nBecause transformers don’t deal efficiently with long context while RNNs can, one idea is to combine both to get the best of both worlds. By dropping the softmax from the output for token $t$:\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{q}_t$, $\\mathbf{k}_j$, and $\\mathbf{v}_j$ are the query, key, and value vectors at positions $t$ and $j$, respectively, and $\\mathbf{o}_t$ is the output at position $t$. By defining $S_t :=\\sum_{j=1}^t \\mathbf{k}_j \\mathbf{v}_j^\\top$, then we get a recurrent relation where $S_t$ summarizes all past $(k_j, v_j)$ pairs:\n\nwhere $S_{t-1}$ is the state from the previous time step. While this gets us closer to an RNN-esque structure, in practice, softmax stabilizes training, and the linear form can cause instability without normalization. With RNNs, it is sometimes helpful to forget the past, by introducing a gate $\\mathbf{G}_t$ for the previous state \n\\(\\mathbf{S}_t=\\mathbf{G}_t \\odot \\mathbf{S}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{v}_t\\mathbf{k}_t^\\top\\)\nwhere $\\odot$ denotes elementwise multiplication and $\\mathbf{G}_t$ is a learned gating mechanism.\nMamba-2 is among the most popular, being used in hybrid models like Nemotron-H and Falcon H1. Hybrid models are becoming increasingly popular, notably in Qwen3-Next with a gated DeltaNet update and Kimi’s next model, likely using their “kimi delta attention.”\n\nTraining stability is crucial for successful large-scale model training. Several techniques help prevent training failures, including regularization methods, careful initialization, and architectural choices. The following sections cover key stability mechanisms:\n\n$z$-loss is a regularization term added to the standard cross entropy loss that keeps logits from drifting to large magnitudes. The softmax denominator is $Z = \\sum_{i=1}^V e^{z_i}$, and by adding $\\mathcal{L} = \\lambda \\cdot \\log^2(Z)$ to the loss, we penalize based on $\\log(Z)$ which represents the overall logit scale.\n\nOn their 1B model, Hugging Face found that adding $Z$-loss didn’t impact training loss or downstream performance, so they chose not to include it due to training overhead. For logit stabilization, logit softcapping (see below) is generally preferred in modern recipes, following the Gemma 2 and Gemma 3 models.\n\nLogit softcapping prevents logits from growing excessively large by mapping them into a bounded range via a smooth, differentiable transformation. Unlike hard clipping (which has zero gradient at the boundaries and can cause training instability), softcapping uses $\\tanh$ to compress values smoothly. The Gemma 2 report introduces the formulation used in production models: cap logits such that values stay within $(-\\texttt{soft_cap}, +\\texttt{soft_cap})$ using\n\nwhere $\\texttt{soft_cap}$ is the threshold hyperparameter controlling the output range. The division normalizes inputs before $\\tanh$ and the multiplication by $\\texttt{soft_cap}$ rescales to the desired interval. Unlike $z$-loss (which adds a regularization term to the loss), softcapping operates directly on activations in the forward pass\n\nGemma 2 applies softcapping to both attention logits (pre-softmax) and the final language modeling head. They set $\\texttt{soft_cap}=50.0$ for attention layers and $\\texttt{soft_cap}=30.0$ for the final layer. The technique traces back to Bello et al., 2016 in the context of neural machine translation. However, one caveat is that logit softcapping is incompatible with Flash Attention / SDPA during training because those fused kernels assume standard attention. The Hugging Face Gemma 2 blog notes that for stable fine-tuning, you must use attn_implementation=\"eager\"; inference can still use SDPA with minimal quality difference. This writeup gives a concise technical overview.\n\nDespite being a regularization technique, removing weight decay from embeddings can improve training stability. Weight decay causes embedding norm to decrease, but this can lead to larger gradients in earlier layers since the LayerNorm Jacobian has a $\\frac1{\\sigma}$ term (coming from normalization) which is inversely proportional to the input norm $\\sigma$.\n\nHugging Face tested this using a weight decay baseline, a no weight decay baseline, and another combining all previous adopted changes and found no significant loss or eval results, so they included no weight decay.\n\nSimilar to $z$-loss, QK-norm helps prevent attention logits from becoming too large by applying LayerNorm to both the query and key vectors before computing attention. However, the same paper which proposed RNoPE found that it hurts long-context tasks because the normalization de-emphasizes relevant tokens and emphasizes irrelevant tokens by stripping the query-key dot product of its magnitude.\n\nRMSNorm maintains comparable performance to LayerNorm while being computationally simpler, due to avoiding the mean-centering computation. A variant called depth-scaled sandwich norm applies normalization both before and after the attention/MLP blocks, with the normalization scale adjusted based on the layer depth:\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}_\\ell$ and $\\mathbf{y}_\\ell$ are input/output of layer $\\ell$, $\\mathcal{M}_\\ell$ is the sublayer module (like attention, FFN, or MoE). The RMSNorm gain, $\\gamma$, is a multiplicative factor applied after the RMS normalization, given by $\\bar{a}_i = \\gamma\\frac{a_i}{\\text{RMSNorm(a)}}$. In Arcee’s case, they initialize $\\gamma\\left(\\text{RMSNorm}_\\ell^{(1)}\\right)=1$ and $\\gamma\\left(\\text{RMSNorm}_\\ell^{(2)}\\right)=\\frac1{\\sqrt{L}}$. This depth-dependent scaling accounts for the fact that activations evolve differently across layers. The sandwich pattern (pre-norm and post-norm) provides additional stability, especially in very deep networks where gradient flow can be challenging.\n\nArcee also applies RMSNorm before the language modeling head stabilizes the final hidden states to ensure consistent output activation scales before they are transformed into token probabilities.\n\nThere are a few considerations that typically guide tokenizer design:\n\nLarger vocabularies can compress text more efficiently, but they come at the cost of a larger embedding matrix, which as mentioned in the embeddings section, can take up a sizable portion of the parameter count. For english-only models, 50k is often enough, while multilingual models need over 100k. There is an optimal size that exists since compression gains from larger vocabularies decrease exponentially.\n\nLarge models benefit from large vocabularies since the extra compression saves more on the forward pass (project to QKV, attention, and MLP) than the additional embedding tokens during softmax. For memory, larger vocab means fewer tokens, so a smaller KV cache.\n\nBPE (byte-pair encoding) still remains the de facto choice. Starting with tiny units (e.g. characters or bytes), the BPE algorithm repeatedly merges the most common adjacent pair into a new token. To evaluate a tokenizer’s performance, fertility is a common metric, measuring the average number of tokens needed to encode a word (alternatively, characters-to-tokens ratio or bytes-to-tokens ratio, but these have limitations due to word length variability and byte representations). Another is proportion of continued words, describing what percentage of words get split into multiple pieces. For both, smaller metrics indicate more efficient tokenizers.\n\nThere are many strong existing tokenizers, like GPT4’s tokenizer and Gemma3’s tokenizer. Often, using existing tokenizers is enough; only when we want to train for low-resource languages or have a different data mixture should we continue training our own tokenizer.\n\nChoosing optimizers and tuning hyperparameters is notoriously time-consuming and significantly impacts convergence speed and training stability. While we may be tempted to distill those from models of larger labs (albeit a useful prior), it may not fit the use case.\n\nDespite being invented over 10 years ago, AdamW still stands the test of time. Adam (adaptive momentum estimation) updates weights individually based on an exponential weighted average of gradients $g_t$ and an exponential weighted average of squared gradients $g_t^2$, along with weight decay (the “W”). The exponential moving averages provide adaptive learning rates per parameter: parameters with consistently large gradients get smaller effective learning rates (via the squared gradient term), while parameters with small or noisy gradients get larger effective learning rates. This adaptivity helps stabilize training and converge faster:\n\nwhere $\\theta$ denotes the model parameters, $\\alpha$ is the learning rate, $\\lambda$ is the weight decay coefficient, $g_t$ is the gradient at step $t$, $m_t$ and $v_t$ are the first and second moment estimates (exponentially weighted averages), $\\hat{m}_t$ and $\\hat{v}_t$ are bias-corrected versions, $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ are exponential decay rates for the moment estimates, and $\\epsilon$ is a small constant (typically $10^{-8}$) to prevent division by zero. Even for modern LLMs, the hyperparameters remain largely unchanged: weight decay factor $\\lambda=0.1$ or $\\lambda=0.01$, $\\beta_1=0.9$, and $\\beta_2=0.95$.\n\nUnlike AdamW which updates per-parameter, muon treats the weight matrix as a singular object and updates based on matrix-level operations. This approach reduces axis-aligned bias (where optimization favors certain coordinate directions) and encourages exploration of directions that would otherwise be suppressed. By considering the entire weight matrix structure rather than individual parameters, muon can better capture correlations between parameters:\n\nwhere $\\theta_t$ denotes the model parameters at step $t$, $\\mathcal{L}_t$ is the loss function, $g_t$ is the gradient matrix, $G_t$ is the normalized gradient matrix (typically $G_t = g_t / |g_t|$), $B_t$ is a momentum buffer matrix with $B_0=0$, $\\mu$ is the momentum coefficient, $\\eta$ is the learning rate, and $\\text{NewtonSchulz5}$ applies the odd function $f(x)=3.4445x-4.7750x^3+2.0315x^5$. This blog and this blog describe the algebra of it in more detail as well as why the coefficients are what they are. The Newton-Schulz iteration approximates the matrix sign function: we can estimate the SVD decompositions of $G=U \\Sigma V^\\top$ by $UV^\\top$, and $f(x)$ essentially replaces $\\Sigma$ because iteratively applying $f$ (i.e., $f \\circ f \\circ \\cdots f(x)$) converges to the sign function, which normalizes the singular values. This has the effect of reducing axis-aligned bias and encouraging exploration of directions that would otherwise be suppressed.\n\nMuon is more sample-efficient than AdamW, especially at large batch sizes where AdamW struggles. Some implementations, including Arcee’s Trinity Large, choose a hybrid approach: using muon for hidden layers while keeping AdamW for embedding and output layers. This decision stems from the different optimization dynamics these layers exhibit—embeddings and output projections benefit from per-parameter adaptive learning rates, while hidden layers capture more benefit from muon’s matrix-level structure awareness.\n\nBut since muon operates at the matrix level, applying NewtonSchulz requires access to the full gradient tensor. One method uses an overlapping round-robin scheme where each rank is responsible for gathering all gradient matrices corresponding to its index and applying muon locally. Since FSDP expects sharded gradients/updates, and every rank has its shard of the muon-updated gradient, then the optimizer step can proceed normally. However, this issues lots of overlapping collectives across many matrices which breaks at scale.\n\nThe alternative that Prime adapts is based on all-to-all collectives which does bulk permutation so that each rank temporarily owns full gradients for its matrices, runs muon, then bulk permutes them back. This may require padding since many tensors are packed into contiguous buffers which can change the size that’s expected. However, this requires fewer collectives and scales better.\n\nBuilding on Muon, Kimi K2 introduces MuonClip, a stabilization technique that prevents exploding attention logits, which is a common failure mode in large-scale training. Other strategies include logit soft-cap, which applies $\\tanh$ clipping to the pre-softmax logits, or QK-norm, which applies LayerNorm to the QK matrices. However, these lead to issues of the scaled dot-product exploding (making bounding too late) and distorted gradients around regions where the model is unstable in logit soft-cap, and key matrices are not materialized during inference (projected from a latent variable).\n\nFor each attention head $h$, consider $\\mathbf{Q}^h$, $\\mathbf{K}^h$, and $\\mathbf{V}^h$ (the query, key, and value matrices for head $h$). For a batch $B$ and input representation $\\mathbf{X}$, define the max logit as a per-head scalar to be the maximum input to softmax\n\nwhere $d$ is the dimension of the query/key vectors, $i$ and $j$ index positions in the sequence, and the $\\frac1{\\sqrt{d}}$ scaling factor matches the standard attention scaling. Set $S_\\text{max} = \\max_h S_\\text{max}^h$ (the maximum across all heads) and target threshold $\\tau$ (a hyperparameter controlling when clipping activates). The idea is to rescale $\\mathbf{W}_k^h$ and $\\mathbf{W}_q^h$ (the key and query projection weight matrices for head $h$) whenever $S_\\text{max}^h$ exceeds $\\tau$. Also, $\\gamma=\\min(1, \\frac{\\tau}{S_\\text{max}})$ (the global clipping factor), one approach is to clip all heads simultaneously by\n\nwhere the $\\gamma$ exponentials enforce multiplicative weight decay for $\\mathbf{Q}^h \\mathbf{K}^{h\\top}$; commonly, $\\alpha=0.5$ to ensure equal scaling to queries and keys. However, not all heads exhibit exploding logits, which motivates a per-head clipping based on $\\gamma_h = \\min(1, \\frac{\\tau}{S_\\text{max}^h})$, which is more straightforward for MHA but less for MLA. The challenge with MLA is that keys are projected from a latent variable rather than materialized directly, so clipping must be applied to the latent-to-key projection weights and the latent variable itself. They apply clipping only on $\\mathbf{q}^C$ and $\\mathbf{k}^C$ (head-specific components) scaled by $\\sqrt{\\gamma_h}$, $\\mathbf{q}^R$ (head-specific rotary) scaled by $\\gamma_h$, and $\\mathbf{Q}^R$ (shared rotary). Besides that, the main muon algorithm is modified to match Adam RMS and enable weight decay. For each weight $\\mathbf{W} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m}$:\n\nwhere $n$ and $m$ are the dimensions of the weight matrix $\\mathbf{W}$, $\\sqrt{\\max(n,m)} \\cdot 0.2$ is a scaling factor that adapts the update magnitude to the matrix size (matching Adam’s RMS scaling behavior), and other symbols follow the same definitions as in the standard Muon algorithm. The weight decay term $(1-\\eta \\lambda)$ is applied multiplicatively before the gradient update.\n\nFigure 6: Left: a mid-scale training run on a 9B active, 53B total MoE where attention logits diverge quickly. Right: maximum logits for KimiK2 with MuonClip and $\\tau=100$, where max logits eventually decays to a stable range after ~30% of the training steps. From Kimi K2.\n\nLearning rates have their own life cycle: they warmup (typically 1%-5% of training steps for short trainings, but large labs fix the warmup steps) from zero to avoid chaos, then anneal after settling into a good minimum. Cosine annealing was the go-to scheduler, but it’s also inflexible due to the cosine period needing to match the total training duration. Alternatives include warmup-stable-decay (WSD) and multi-step; in the last x% of tokens, the former linearly decays the learning rate whereas multi-step does discrete drops. For WSD, typically 10-20% is allocated for the decay phase, matching cosine annealing; in multi-step, 80/10/10 also matches cosine annealing while 70/15/15 and 60/20/20 can outperform it. Deepseek-v3 used cosine annealing between the decay drops and added a constant phase before the final sharp step.\n\nFigure 7: Comparison of learning rate schedules: cosine annealing, WSD, and multi-step. From Hugging Face.\n\nHugging Face’s ablations (on their 1B model) showed that WSD tended to underperform cosine annealing before WSD’s decay began, but once it entered its decay phase, WSD showed nearly linear improvement in both loss and eval metrics, which allowed it to catch up to cosine annealing by the end. After running further ablations on the learning rate, the Hugging Face team settled on 2e-4; increasing led to potential increased risk of instability during long training runs. Kimi K2 also uses WSD: the first 10T were trained with 2e-4 learning rate after a 500 step warm up, then 5.5T tokens with cosine decay from 2e-4 to 2e-5.\n\nWSD schedule especially helps with ablations since it does not require restarting the same run for different token counts, since we can retrain only the end portions (learning rate decay) while maintaining the front portion.\n\nThere is a critical batch size: too small and we may be underutilizing compute, but too large and the model needs more tokens to reach the same loss. Still, larger batch sizes give more efficient gradient estimations, and are preferred.\n\nA useful proxy is that for optimizers like AdamW or Muon, if the batch size increases by a factor of $k$ then the learning rate should scale up by $\\sqrt{k}$. Intuitively, larger batches provide more stable gradient estimates (lower variance), so we can afford larger step sizes. Mathematically, the covariance shrinks by a factor of $k$, and based on the SGD parameter update $\\Delta w = -\\eta g_B$, we have $\\text{Var}(\\Delta w) \\sim \\eta^2 \\frac{\\Sigma}{B}$ where $B$ is the original batch size. To maintain the same update variance, we need $\\eta \\sim \\sqrt{k}$.\n\nAs training progresses, the critical batch size grows. Initially, since the model is making large updates, $\\lvert \\lvert g \\rvert \\rvert^2$ is large so the model should have a small critical batch size. After the model stabilizes, larger batches become more effective. This motivates the idea of batch size warmup.\n\nImbalanced minibatches can arise when sequence packing or data distribution creates batches with highly variable sequence lengths or domain compositions, which can cause gradient variance that destabilizes training; this is especially true when certain experts or model components receive disproportionately many or few tokens.\n\nArcee introduces random sequential document buffer (RSDB) to reduce intra-batch correlation. After tokenizing a document, it works by loading the token sequence as an entry in the RSDB with a read head at index 0; this is repeated until the RSDB is full. From a randomly sampled index in a randomly sampled document from the RSDB, tokens are read based on the read head and the index and added to a separate sequence buffer. Read head positions are updated, and if the sequence buffer is full, we return; otherwise, we randomly select another document index and continue to read tokens into the sequence buffer, repeating until the sequence buffer is full.\n\nThe internal buffer size (in Trinity Large: 8192 per GPU) is set to twice the user-specified buffer value and refilled when the buffer reaches the user-specified value (in Trinity Large: 4096 per GPU) or when old documents need to be purged/new documents can be loaded. Arcee found that this optimization significantly improved dataloader performance.\n\nScaling laws (e.g. Chinchilla scaling laws) provide a useful proxy for determining how aggressively/conservatively to update hyperparameters as model size scales.\n\nFirst, $C \\approx 6 \\cdot N \\cdot D$ where $C$ is the compute budget measured in FLOPs, N is the number of parameters, and $D$ is the number of training tokens. The 6 is derived from empirical estimates for the number of FLOPs per parameter.\n\nFigure 8: Scaling curves of batch size and learning rate. From DeepSeek.\n\nInitially, scaling laws indicated that language model size was the main constraint, leading to a GPT-3 model with 175B parameters but only trained on 300B tokens. A re-derivation found that training duration could improve gains more than size; they found that compute-optimal training of GPT-3 should have consumed 3.7T tokens.\n\nHowever, scaling laws are almost never religiously followed. Recently, labs have been “overtraining” models beyond the training durations suggested by scaling laws (e.g. Qwen 3 being trained on 36T tokens). Moreover, “compute-optimal” scaling laws don’t account for larger models being more expensive after training due to inference. To that end, Hugging Face decided to train on 11T tokens on a 3B model. For comparison, Kimi K2’s 1T model comprised of 15.5T pre-training tokens.\n\nWhile general scaling laws provide guidance, Kimi K2’s scaling law analysis revealed model-specific insights. They showed that an increase in sparsity, the ratio of total number of experts to the number of activated experts, yields substantial performance improvements for fixed FLOPs, so they increase the number of MoE experts to 384 (256 in DeepSeek-V3) while decreasing attention heads to 64 (128 in DeepSeek-V3) to reduce computational overhead during inference. They settle on a sparsity of 48, activating 8 out of 384 experts and found that decreasing the attention heads from 128 to 64 sacrificed a validation loss ranging from 0.5% to 1.2%, but a 45% decrease in inference FLOPs.\n\nEven with the perfect architecture, a model’s performance is still heavily dependent on its training data; no amount of compute or optimization can compensate for training on the wrong content. To this end, it’s about assembling the right data mixture, balancing training objectives and tuning data proportions. This is particularly difficult since across competing objectives, for a fixed compute budget, increasing one proportion necessarily decreases another, hurting performance.\n\nThere already exist large corpora of pre-training datasets like FineWeb2 and The Pile. However, there are still a plethora of information gaps, so recent models additionally rely on specialized pretraining datasets for domains like math and coding.\n\nOne consideration is data quality. Of course, training on the highest quality data possible is preferable. But for a training budget of $X$ tokens, because high quality data is limited, only filtering for it would lead to repeated data, which can be harmful. So, an ideal mixture includes both higher and lower quality data.\n\nAnother consideration is model safety. For gpt-oss-120b, OpenAI addresses this by filtering the data for harmful content in pre-training, with an emphasis on hazardous biosecurity knowledge. They use CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear) pre-training filters that were used in GPT-4o.\n\nMulti-stage training, the idea of evolving the data mixture as training progresses, can better maximize both high-quality and lower-quality data compared to a static mixture because a LM’s final behavior is heavily dictated by the data it sees at the end of training. So, this motivates the strategy of saving the higher quality data towards the end. This introduces another variable of when to begin changing mixtures, and a general principle to performance-driven intervention: if a benchmark begins to plateau, it’s a signal to introduce high-quality data for that domain.\n\nWhile architectural ablations are done on smaller models (e.g. on 1B models to train for 3B models), data mixture ablations are done at scale because larger models have much larger capacities to understand a variety of domains. Moreover, annealing ablations are done on checkpoints of the main run (like 7T out of 11T tokens) to determine what datasets to introduce when.\n\nTo determine optimal data proportions, recent models often use a validation loss or a holdout loss to minimize based on evaluation objectives and data domains. However, some of these methods tend to converge toward distributions that mirror the dataset size distribution, and they don’t outperform careful manual ablations.\n\nToken efficiency is how much performance improvement is achieved per token consumed during training. This can be improved via better token utility, the effective learning signal each token contributes; this motivates finding the optimal balance of high-quality tokens, since they should be maximally leveraged but also limited to prevent overfitting and reduced generalization.\n\nKimi K2 uses data rephrasing in knowledge and math domains. For knowledge, this comes in the form of style and perspective-diverse prompting to rephrase the texts, chunk-wise autoregressive generation to gradually build a rephrased version of long documents, and fidelity verification to ensure semantic alignment. In the main training run, each corpus is rephrased at most twice. For math, diversity is increased via rephrasing into a “learning-note style” and translation into other languages.\n\nHugging Face’s goal was to build a multi-lingual model that also excels on math and coding. In stage 1 of their multi-stage training, they use a 75/12/10/3 split among english web data, multilingual web data, code data, and math data.\n\nFor new stages (using a checkpoint at around 7T out of the total 11T tokens), they use a 40/60 split between the baseline mixture and the new dataset. SmolLM3 has three stages: 8T tokens @ 4k context for base training, 2T tokens @ 4k context for high-quality injection, and 1.1T tokens @4k context a reasoning/Q&A stage.\n\nUsing data from DCLM and FineWeb, Nous first performs semantic deduplication using embeddings at a cosine similarity of 0.7, and then uses an LLM-as-judge to filter out incomplete or ill-formatted messages. Then, they process pre-training data through DataForge, a graph-based synthetic data generator, which allows for large and complex structures. By taking a random walk through a directed acyclic graph where nodes implement a mapping from struct $\\to$ struct such that if there is an edge from node $A$ to node $B$, the postconditions guaranteed by $A$ must satisfy the preconditions of $B$. QA pairs are generated using this workflow with intermediary transformations into other mediums (e.g. a wikipedia article into a rap song), question generation and then questions/answers annotations using an LLM-as-judge to grade the instruction and response. Also, to find a covering set of data-scarce domains of special interest, they recursively (depth-first-search) generate a taxonomy of subdomains where the leaves are prompts and the LLM enumerates $n$ subdomains to form a partition.\n\nThe DataForge-generated data is used in both pre-training and post-training stages, with specific details provided in the post-training data section below.\n\nMid-training is the intermediary step between pre-training and post-training where the base model is trained further on a large amount of domain-specific tokens, especially shaping the model to focus on common core skills like coding or reasoning. Often-times, the decision to mid-train is only made after initial SFT experiments are run because they may reveal performance gaps that indicate the need to mid-train on certain domains. But if the goal is to elicit shallow capabilities like style or conversation, the compute is better spent in post-training.\n\nSome recipes include an additional long context stage; for example, Qwen3 first trained on 30T tokens at 4k context, then a reasoning stage with 5T higher-quality tokens mainly on STEM and coding, and finally a long context stage at 32k context length.\n\nSmolLM3 also does this, but instead of scaling from 4k to 128k directly, they sequentially scale from 4k to 32k to 64k to 128k, which allows the model to adapt at each length before pushing the context length further. Upsampling long context documents like web articles or books improve long context, but Hugging Face didn’t observe improvement; they hypothesize that this is because their baseline mixture already includes long documents using RNoPE.\n\nTo go from 4k to 32k and later to 64k, they use RoPE ABF and increase the base frequency to 2M and 5M, respectively. Base frequencies like 10M further improved slightly on RULER, long context benchmark, but it hurt short context tasks like GSM8k, so they were disregarded. To reach 128k, they found that using YARN from the 64k checkpoint (instead of using a four-fold increase from 32k) produced better performance, which confirms the hypothesis that training closer to the desired inference length benefits performance.\n\nKimi K2 decays learning rate from 2e-5 to 7e-6, training on 400B tokens with 4k sequence length, then 60B tokens with a 32k sequence length. To extend to 128k, they use YARN.\n\nWhile the mid-training data usually comes from web data, another powerful approach is to use distilled reasoning tokens from a better model, as Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning did from DeepSeek-R1. When applied to the base model, distilled mid-training increased benchmark scores like AIM24 by 3x, MATH-500 by 11 points, and GPQA-D by almost 6 points. SmolLM3 also does distilled mid-training. They considered datasets including reasoning tokens from DeepSeek-R1 (4M samples) and QwQ-32B (1.2M samples) but decide to delay using the Mixture of Thoughts dataset until the final SFT mix. They found that it almost always makes sense to perform some amount of mid-training if the base model hasn’t already seen lots of reasoning data during pre-training, because they noticed that /no_think reasoning mode also had improvements on reasoning benchmarks.\n\nGiven today’s standards of LLMs as coding agents and assistants that can reason, there are four broad classes of evals that researchers care about:\n\nThese evals test the following:\n\nTo prevent overfitting, evals that encapsulate robustness or adaptability, like GSMPlus which perturbs problems from GSM8k, are also included. Another way is using interval evals or vibe evaluations/arenas, such as manually probing the model’s behavior. Other tips include using small subsets to accelerate evals (especially if there’s correlation with a larger eval), fixing the LLM-as-judge model (if the eval requires it), treat anything used during ablations as validation, use avg@k accuracy, and try not to (don’t) benchmax!\n\nIt’s first worth mentioning that Intellect-3 is a 106B parameter MoE (12B activate) post-trained on top of GLM-4.5-Air base model from Z.ai, and that they have their own post-training stack including prime-rl, an open framework for large-scale asynchronous RL, verifiers library for training and evals from their Environments Hub, sandbox code execution and compute orchestration.\n\nIntegrating with the Environments Hub, Prime trains on a diverse and challenging mix of environments designed to improve coding and reasoning capabilities. For math, they design an environment with long CoT reasoning in mind, consisting of 21.2K challenging math problems from Skywork-OR1, Acereason-Math, DAPO, and ORZ-Hard, all of which are curated datasets derived from AIME, NuminaMath, Tulu3 math, and others which test difficult math questions from multiple choice to proofs to those involving figures. Even using verifiers, there were a non-trivial amount of false negatives, so they additionally use opencompass/CompassVerifier-7B as a LLM-judge verifier. For science (mainly physics, chemistry, and biology), they filter 29.3K challenging problems from MegaScience while also using LLM-judge verification and standard math verifiers. For logic (games like Sudoku or Minesweeper), 11.6K problems and verifiers were adapted from SynLogic.\n\nFor code, they primarily use their Synthetic-2 dataset along with Prime Sandboxes to verify solutions. They also develop two SWE environments that support scaffolding for common formats like R2E-Gym, SWE-smith, and Multi-SWE-bench to fix issues within a Github project when equipped to Bash commands and edit tooling. Also, the maximum number of turns for the agent is set at 200.\n\nPrime also focuses on its deep research capabilities via their web search environment, which provides the model with a set of search tools. The environment tasks the model with answering questions from the dataset using tools and is rewarded either 1 or 0 using z-AI’s DeepDive dataset, with 1K samples for SFT trajectory generation and 2.2K samples for RL. When tested in Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507, 26 steps of SFT with batch size of 34 followed by 120 steps of RL at a group size of 16 and batch size of 512 was enough to reach mean reward of 0.7.\n\nThey use 300k prompts, mostly STEM and coding from WebInstruct-Verified, rSTAR-Coder, and DeepMath-103k and apply deduplicating and filtering for prompts with >2k characters.\n\nNous rejection samples against ~1k task-specific verifiers using Atropos. Some environments used to generate the dataset include\n\nA critical capability that Kimi K2 chooses to focus on is tool use. While benchmarks like $\\tau$-bench and ACEBench exist, it’s often difficult to construct real-world environments at scale due to cost, complexity, privacy, and accessibility. Kimi K2 builds off of ACEBench’s data synthesis framework to simulate real-world tool-use scenarios at scale:\n\nUsing 3k+ real MCP tools from Github and 20k synthetic tools generated hierarchically in domains like financial trading, software applications, and robot control. Diversification among agents is ensured via the combination of distinct system prompts with distinct tool combinations, and tasks are graded using an explicit rubric with an LLM judge.\n\nFor RL, Kimi K2’s treatment for math, STEM, and logical tasks remains similar to those of other models. Coding and software engineering comes largely from competition-level programming problems and PRs/issues from GitHub. For instruction following, they use two verification mechanisms: deterministic evaluation via code interpreters for verifiable outputs and LLM-as-judge evaluations for non-verifiable outputs. The data was constructed using expert-crafted prompts and rubrics, agentic instruction augmentation inspired by AutoIF, and a fine-tuned model specialized for generating additional instructions probing specific failure modes or edge cases.\n\nA few important considerations for designing/picking a good chat template include system role customizability, tool calling, reasoning, and compatibility with inference engines like vLLM or SGLang. Qwen3 and GPT-OSS satisfy all criteria, and Qwen3 is designed for hybrid reasoning.\n\nIn SmolLM3, despite also being designed for hybrid reasoning, they discard the reasoning content for all but the final turn in the conversation to avoid blowing up the context during inference, but for training, it’s important to retain the reasoning tokens to condition the model properly. So, Hugging Face orchestrates their own chat template, satisfying all criteria. Vibe tests initially revealed a bug of not passing in the custom instructions into their custom template, but this was quickly patched.\n\nWhile deriving inspiration from the Qwen3 template, Intellect-3 always reasons (not hybrid) by proxy of being dominantly trained on reasoning-only SFT traces; they use qwen3_coder tool call parser and deepseek_r1 reasoning parser to ensure reasoning chains are consistently represented.\n\ngpt-oss-120b uses the harmony chat template, which introduces “channels” that determine the visibility of each message. For example, final for answers shown to the user, commentary for tool calling, and analysis for CoT tokens. This allows the model to interleave tool calls with CoT.\n\nHermes 4 adapts Llama 3’s chat template by changing the assistant to a first-person identifier after identifying the sensitivity to the token used for the assistant’s turn:\n\nThis results in markedly different behaviors, which is explored more in “behaviors and latent capabilities” subsection of “behaviors and safety” section.\n\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero’s chat template looks very similar to others, but additionally includes $\\mathtt{}$ tags to provide the final answer.\n\nMost post-training pipelines start with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) because it’s cheap compared to RL, stable due to insensitivity to reward design and hyperparameters, and gives a strong baseline off of the base model. Usually, base models are too unrefined to benefit from more advanced post-training methods. SFT often comes in the form of distillation from stronger models. Strong models may suffer from success and skip the SFT stage because there are no stronger models to distill from (such is the case with DeepSeek R1-Zero).\n\nDataset curation for SFT is important; datasets might seem great on paper, but models trained on those datasets may end up overindexing on certain domains, such as science. To this end, Hugging Face curated a data mixture with ~100k examples and 76.1M tokens, mostly consisting of instruction following, reasoning, and steerability for both think and non-think modes. Importantly, data should be paired across modes because otherwise, there is not an indication of when to give a concise answer or use extended reasoning.\n\nFor training, there are other considerations as well: full finetuning vs more parameter efficient methods like LoRA or QLoRA, specialized kernels like FlashAttention (which reduces memory usage by recomputing attention on-the-fly during the backward pass, trading compute for memory) or the likes of SonicMoE for more efficient compute usage, masking the loss for only assistant tokens, the type of parallelism needed, learning rate tuning, and sequence length tuning to match the distribution of data to speed up training (more useful for larger datasets).\n\nCute cross-entropy kernel (CCE) is a memory-efficient CUDA kernel for computing cross-entropy loss. Instead of materializing the full logit matrix in global memory, CCE computes only the logit for the correct token and evaluates the log-sum-exp over all vocabulary items on-the-fly using faster memory tiers, dramatically reducing memory consumption. The kernel leverages the sparsity of softmax by skipping gradient computation for elements with negligible contributions below numerical precision. This makes it particularly valuable for models with large vocabularies.\n\nIn Intellect-3, Prime splits SFT into two stages: general reasoning SFT and agentic SFT. In the first, they use datasets consisting of math, code, science, tooling, chat, and instruction splits from Nemotron’s post-training dataset and AM-DeepSeek-R1-0528-Distilled for a total of 9.9B tokens. In the second stage, they target agentic behavior, tool use, and long-horizon control (gpt-oss-120b also targets agentic behavior and tool use), using a mix of open-source agentic datasets like SWE-Swiss and synthetically-generate datasets from the Environments Hub using DeepSeek-R1. Besides serving the purpose of fine-tuning for agentic behavior, this stage also has the effect of pushing the model toward longer effective context lengths. Using context parallelism, they scaled from a 65K context window to 98K.\n\nIn Hermes 4, they also do two stages of SFT, both around reasoning. They noted that despite training on sequences at most 16k tokens in length, the reasoning lengths frequently exceed 41k tokens on reasoning tasks. So, they do a second stage to teach the model to generate the closing $\\mathtt{</think>}$ tags at 30k tokens, their budget. This insertion at a fixed token count allows the model to learn a counting behavior (“when you reach $N$ tokens, stop”) while ensuring that the model’s own distribution doesn’t change significantly. This also avoids the problem of model collapse when recursive training on full, self-generated outputs leads to distribution narrowing and quality degradation.\n\nThe Hugging Face team found issues in generalising single-turn reasoning data to multi-turn data, stemming from the difficulty in differentiating /think and /no_think tags between turns. So, they constructed a new dataset, IFThink, using Qwen3-32B that augmented single-turn instructions into multi-turn exchanges with verifiable instructions and reasoning traces; this dramatically improved multi-turn reasoning.\n\nMasking user turns is another design choice, since otherwise loss is computed on user queries as well, sacrificing producing high-quality assistant responses for predicting user queries. In practice, masking doesn’t have a huge impact on downstream evals, but still yielded improvements by a few points in most cases.\n\nSequence packing is another choice that improves training efficiency. The idea is similar to intra-document masking where sequences are packed into a batch so as to not waste padding compute via excessive padding tokens, but with the additional constraint of minimizing truncation of documents across batch boundaries.\n\nFigure 9: Comparison of sequence packing strategies. From Hugging Face.\n\nIn the image, the last packing method uses the best-fit decreasing (implemented in TRL), where each sequence is placed in the batch that minimizes the remaining space after insertion. Another method, which Hermes-4 uses, is first-fit decreasing, which places a sequence in the first batch that has enough remaining space, which achieves $>99.9\\%$ batch efficiency.\n\nDespite yielding up to a 33x tokens/batch/optimization step, for a fixed token budget, packing alters training dynamics since the more data means fewer gradient updates. This especially hurts small datasets where each sample matters more. An effective batch size of 128 hurt evals like IFEval by up to 10%; for effective batch sizes larger than 32, there was an average drop in performance (for SmolLM3 and the dataset). But for large datasets, packing is almost always beneficial.\n\nThe learning rate for SFT is usually an order of magnitude smaller than that for pre-training since the model has already learned rich representations, and aggressive updates can lead to catastrophic forgetting. And because SFT runtime is so short compared to pre-training, it makes sense to do full learning rate sweeps. For SmolLM3, learning rates of 3e-6 or 1e-5 worked best. When packing is enabled, it’s safer to decrease the learning rate further due to the larger effective batch size and getting fewer updates for the same token budget.\n\nOnce a good data mixture is identified and hyperparameters are tuned, training on more than one epoch (what was usually done in ablations) also leads to increased performance by a few percentage points; on LiveCodeBench v4, performance nearly doubled from epoch two to three.\n\nAn interesting idea explored is whether the optimizers for pre/post-training should be the same. AdamW remains the default choice for both pre/post-training, and when tested with Muon, using the same optimizer still yielded the best performance.\n\nBecause SFT is fundamentally a form of imitation learning, extremely large SFT datasets can be redundant due to diminishing gains or failure modes that aren’t encapsulated in the data. Another useful signal is preference, i.e. which response, A or B, is preferred and enables model performance to scale beyond the limits of SFT alone. Also, less data is needed for preference optimization than SFT since the starting point is already strong.\n\nFor generating preference datasets, there are a few methods:\n\nWhile preference optimization is generally thought as a medium to improve helpfulness or alignment, it can also teach models to reason better, like using strong-vs-weak preferences.\n\nThere are typically three hyperparameters that affect training dynamics:\n\nBesides vanilla DPO (direct preference optimization), researchers have explored a variety of alternatives:\n\nHugging Face found that APO-zero had the best overall out-of-domain performance.\n\nSFT and PO can hit ceilings because fundamentally, they optimize to produce outputs that look like the dataset and PO is often off-policy and weak at multi-step credit assignment. RL (reinforcement learning) helps by providing a reward signal through interaction with an environment. Verifiers can automatically check correctness and provide those reward signals, and objectives can be optimized for beyond preference labels.\n\nIn RLHF (RL from human feedback), human comparisons are provided, and a reward model is trained to predict the human preference signal. Then, the policy is fine-tuned with RL to maximize the learned reward. This way, RLHF does on-policy optimization since it does rollouts using the current policy used in training and updates based on the reward given by the reward model. This also allows RLHF to discover behaviors not present in the preference dataset.\n\nIn RLVR (RL with verifiable rewards), popularised by DeepSeek-R1, verifiers check whether a model’s output matches criteria (e.g. whether it produced the correct math answer or passed all code unit tests) to generate reward signals, making it more scalable and objective. Then, the policy is fine-tuned to produce more verifiably-correct outputs. RLVR is particularly valuable when reward drift is a concern (verifiers provide very stable signals compared to learned reward models), when KL control is needed to prevent policy collapse, and when addressing stale-policy artifacts in multi-step reasoning tasks.\n\nAlthough policy optimization algorithms are commonly on-policy, like GRPO, in practice, to maximize throughput, they may actually be slightly off-policy. For example, in GRPO, without freezing the policy, generating multiple rollout batches and doing optimizer updates sequentially makes only the first batch on-policy and all subsequent batches off-policy; this is known as in-flight updates. In-flight updates matter most when throughput is critical (e.g., large-scale RL training), when reward drift could accumulate from stale policies, when KL divergence between inference and training policies needs careful monitoring, and when long rollouts span multiple policy updates. The tradeoff is between training efficiency and policy consistency; techniques like importance sampling clipping (as in IcePop) help mitigate the off-policy bias.\n\nFigure 10: Comparison of conventional RL and in-flight updating. From Pipeline RL paper.\n\nIn the context of Intellect-3, which uses a CPU orchestrator between two clusters (one for training and one for inference), the orchestrator continuously polls the trainer to update the inference pool once a new policy is available, and the inference pool temporarily halts generation to update the weights, then continues with rollouts. In this way, a long rollout could be generated by multiple policies, but they limit this by a max_off_policy_steps parameter to limit policy drift. Also, they implement IcePop to stabilize MoE training:\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{M}(k)=k$ if $k \\in [\\alpha, \\beta]$ and $0$ otherwise. The purpose of $\\mathcal{M}$ is to account for the off-policy nature between the training policy and the inference policy such that they don’t diverge significantly for each token. When the importance weight $k$ falls outside $[\\alpha, \\beta]$, $\\mathcal{M}$ clips it to 0, effectively ignoring that token’s contribution to the gradient. This is the idea behind importance sampling, where rollouts come from the inference policy, but we are optimizing for the training policy. Prime uses the default $\\alpha = 0.5, \\beta = 5$. $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ need not be symmetric in the multiplicative sense. One reason for this is under the rare instance when $\\pi_\\text{infer}$ is small (large $k$), a tighter $\\beta$ would clip the high-entropy tokens, which would make learning dynamics worse.\n\nKimi K2 adapts a different policy optimization approach from their previous model K1.5:\n\nwhere $\\overline{r}(x)= \\frac1{K} \\sum_{i=1}^K r(x,y_i)$ is the mean reward of sampled responses and $\\tau > 0$ is a regularization parameter for stable learning, akin to KL divergence.\n\nAnother consideration is PTX loss: pre-training cross-entropy loss. During joint RL training, the model can catastrophically forget valuable, high-quality data. So, they curate a dataset using hand-selected, high-quality samples and integrate them into the RL objective via the PTX loss. The advantages are twofold: high-quality data can be leveraged, and the risk of overfitting to the tasks present during RL can be mitigated, which leads to better generalization.\n\nTo balance exploration and exploitation throughout training, they implement temperature decay. For tasks like creative writing and complex reasoning, high temperatures during the initial stages is important to generate diverse and innovative responses; this prevents premature convergence to local minima and facilitates the discovery of effective strategies. At later stages, the temperature is decayed (following a schedule) so that there is not excessive randomness, and that it doesn’t compromise the reliability/consistency of the model’s outputs.\n\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero stands out as an exception compared to other models because it demonstrates that RL can be effective even without supervised fine-tuning. It cold-starts RL (specifically, GRPO to save training costs; they use 10.4k steps, batch size of 512, reference policy replacement every 400 steps along with lr as 3e-6, KL coefficient as 0.001) on reasoning tasks without any supervised data. The reward system uses two types of rewards: accuracy rewards based on correctness of the response and format rewards that enforce the model to put its thinking process between thinking tags. It obtains robust reasoning capabilities using pure RL, which validates the ability to learn reasoning and generalize effectively. Moreover, behaviors including reflection (re-evaluating previous steps) and exploring alternative approaches to problem-solving emerge, which further enhances reasoning. The count of reflective words such as “wait” or “mistake” rises 5-7-fold compared to the start of training. Moreover, this reflective behavior appeared relatively suddenly: between steps 4k-7k, there was only occasional usage, but after step 8k, it exhibited significant spikes.\n\nFigure 11: The multi-stage pipeline of DeepSeek-R1 with intermediate checkpoints DeepSeek-R1 Dev1, Dev2, and Dev3. From DeepSeek.\n\nFor DeepSeek-R1, they collect thousands of long CoT data to finetune the DeepSeek-V3-Base as the starting point for RL. From DeepSeek-R1-Zero, they learned that readability was an issue: responses sometimes mixed multiple languages or lacked markdown formatting for highlighting answers. They remedy the former by introducing a language consistency reward (portion of target language words in the CoT), and the latter by designing a readable pattern that includes a summary at the end of each response. They also perform a second RL stage aimed at improving the model’s helpfulness and harmlessness while retaining reasoning capabilities.\n\nFor helpfulness, they focus on emphasizing the utility and relevance of the final summary. To generate preference pairs, they query DeepSeek-V3 four times and randomly assign responses as either Response A or Response B; they then average the independent judgments and retain pairs where the score difference is sufficiently large and use a pairwise loss to define the objective. For harmlessness, they evaluate the response to identify and mitigate any potential risk, biases, or harmful content. Using a dataset with model-generated responses annotated as “safe” or “unsafe” according to safety guidelines, the reward model is trained using a point-wise methodology to distinguish between safe/unsafe responses.\n\nImpressively, they found that distilling DeepSeek-R1’s outputs into smaller models like Qwen-32B significantly improved reasoning capabilities, even compared to large-scale RL, which further requires significantly more compute. Moreover, it shows that even while distillation strategies are effective and economical, we will increasingly require more powerful base models and larger-scale RL.\n\nFigure 12: Comparison of DeepSeek-R1-distilled and RL Models on Reasoning-Related Benchmarks. From DeepSeek.\n\nBeyond the main training pipeline, DeepSeek’s appendix documents additional considerations that influenced their design choices:\n\nThe goal of RLVR on hybrid reasoning models is to improve reasoning capabilities without extending the token count too radically. For /no_think, naively applying GRPO can lead to reward hacking since the model begins to emit longer CoT (shifting towards /think); as such, both reward and token length increase. SmolLM3 observed this and found that RLVRed /no_think traces showed cognitive behaviors like “Wait, …” associated with reasoning models.\n\nThis can be mitigated via an overlong completion penalty which penalizes completions over a certain length, which is a function parametrized by a soft punishment threshold and a hard punishment threshold/max completion length. Penalty increases from the soft to the hard threshold, and past the latter, the punishment is -1 (effective reward = 0).\n\nFor /no_think, SmolLM3 decided on a length penalty in the range of 2.5k-3k that balanced improvement in performance and increase in response length. However, doing RL jointly on hybrid reasoning models is difficult since it requires separate length penalties, whose interplay can cause instability. This is also why labs release instruct and reasoning variants separately.\n\nKimi K2 uses a self-critique rubric reward mechanism, where the model evaluates its own outputs to generate preference signals. The K2 actor generates $k$ rollouts, and the K2 critic ranks all results by performing pairwise evaluations against a combination of rubrics; these combine core rubrics (fundamental values) and prescriptive rubrics (aimed to eliminate reward hacking), and human-annotated rubrics (for specific instructional contexts).\n\nThe critic model is refined using verifiable signals, and this process of transfer learning grounds its more subjective judgments in verifiable data. This should allow the critic to recalibrate its evaluation standard in lockstep with the policy’s evolution.\n\nTo RL effectively, curriculum learning is another effective way which gradually exposes the model to progressively difficult problems. First, problems are sorted into difficulty pools (such as easy, medium, and hard) based on the problem’s observed solve rate; In Intellect-3 for math and coding, this was done via querying Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 over eight generations per problem while for science and logic, they queried the same model 16 times. Then, during each stage, they maintain a balanced curriculum that avoids training with trivially easy or overly difficult problems which don’t give meaningful learning signal (and also helps maintain gradients in GRPO). In Kimi K2, this was done by using the SFT model’s pass@k accuracy.\n\nOne alternative is online DPO (see “On policy with grading” in the preference optimization section). Another is on-policy distillation. Instead of preferences, the signal comes from a stronger teacher model, where the student samples responses at every training step and the KL divergence between the student/teacher logits provides the learning signal. That way, the student can continuously learn from the teacher. Also, on-policy distillation is much cheaper than GRPO since instead of sampling multiple rollouts per prompt, we only sample one, which is graded by the teacher in a single forward-backward pass; its performance boost, as the Qwen3 tech report notes, can be larger across the board as well. One limiting factor is that the student and the teacher must share the same tokenizer, and Hugging Face’s General On-Policy Logit Distillation (GOLD) allows any teacher to be distilled into any student.\n\nThinking Machine’s blog further showed that on-policy distillation mitigates catastrophic forgetting, where a model post-trained on a new model regresses on other, previous domains. Specifically, they found that mid-training 70% and with on-policy distillation can achieve close to the best performance of a model and its mid-trained version, effectively restoring behavior with cheap distillation.\n\nGiven these aforementioned algorithms, choosing between them can be hard; Hugging Face aptly describes it:\n\nAnd for DPO (semi-online and online), it is also possible to match GRPO using far less compute. Specifically, they found that semi-online DPO (with syncing between the trainer and the generator every 100 steps) was generally the best compared to semi-online DPO with sync every 10 steps, online DPO, and GRPO.\n\nDeepSeek shares other experimental methods when developing DeepSeek-R1 that ultimately failed. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), inspired by AlphaGo and AlphaZero, was implemented to test enhancing test-time compute scalability. This breaks answers into smaller parts to allow the model to explore the solution space systematically. To do this, they prompted the model to generate tags corresponding to reasoning steps necessary. The problem is that token generation exists in an exponentially larger search space compared to chess. So, they set a max extension limit for each node, but this leads to the model getting stuck in local optima. Moreover, training a fine-grained value model is difficult, also due to complexities of token generation.\n\nThey also explored process reward models, which rewards intermediate thoughts in multi-step tasks. DeepSeek acknowledges three limitations: defining a fine-grained step in general reasoning is difficult, determining whether the current intermediate step is difficult (LLM-as-judge might not yield satisfactory results), and it leads to reward hacking because the model would optimize for the appearance of good reasoning without doing the underlying work.\n\nDuring post-training, they perform an additional stage of RL to reward answers that comply with OpenAI’s policy against unsafe prompts. Because all of these models have open model weights, then one worry is that malicious parties can enhance the model’s harmful capabilities. By running Preparedness evaluations on gpt-oss-120b, OpenAI confirmed that the model doesn’t achieve threshold for high capability in biological/chemical capability, cyber capability, and AI self-improvement.\n\nThey also tested whether adversarial actors could fine-tune gpt-oss-120b to reach high capability in the aforementioned domains. They simulated the attack by either:\n\nUpon review, their safety advisory group concluded that even with robust fine-tuning, gpt-oss-120b still couldn’t reach high capability in the aforementioned domains. Also, they determined whether releasing the model could advance the frontier of biological capabilities, including evaluations like virology and tacit knowledge, in open foundation models (which also increases risk) and found that there were other open weight models at or near gpt-oss-120b, so they decided that releasing has low impact on the frontier.\n\nOpenAI also evaluated safety performance using other indicators:\n\nContinuing from the chat template section, Nous’ decision to change the token used from the assistant’s turn from $\\mathtt{assistant}$ to $\\mathtt{me}$ enabled Hermes 4 to adopt a first-person, peer-like persona. Hermes 4 generates responses with fewer meta-disclaimers and more consistent voice embodiment, resulting in higher behavioral plasticity that is not as common in large models.\n\nSimilarly, Hermes 4 demonstrates comparatively greater contextual fidelity over policy rigidity. Most other large models will follow policy compliance even when faced with fictional or controlled prompts (such as issuing disclaimers or reformulated responses to align with safety constraints), but Hermes 4 interprets fictional prompts more as role-play and generates in-character responses. This also means that Hermes 4 has a lower refusal rate; on their internal RefusalBench, they found that Hermes 4 (reasoning) ranked highest (lowest refusal rate) among all tested models, whereas gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, perhaps unsurprisingly, had the lowest scores (highest refusal rate). Also, this level of embodied personas extends even to political analysis, where the model produces reasoning balancing factual recall with nuanced framing, and less of policy-driven hedging common to other large models.\n\nExcessive sycophancy is an undesired behavioral trait, so most models apply an anti-sycophancy system prompt to adjust surface-level politeness while leaving underlying reasoning unchanged. When implemented in Hermes 4, Nous observed a deeper shift: CoT traces reflect the aim to steer user interaction away from inference. This sometimes introduces embodied or emphatic language.\n\nBefore the main training run starts, ensure the infrastructure is ready. This includes Slurm reservations on clusters, stress-testing GPUs (GPU Fryer or DCGM), and avoid storage bloat by uploading checkpoints to third parties and deleting local copies after saving the next. To this end, checkpoint and auto-resume systems are important.\n\nEvals are also deceptively time-consuming (Allen Institute spent roughly 20% on compute on evals), so ensuring automation and logging (not just evaluation scores, but also throughput, loss, gradient norm, and node health) is crucial.\n\nHugging Face observed a ~40% drop in throughput (14k to 8k tokens/sec/GPU) after a few hours of starting the main run. The issue came from data storage; their cluster uses a network-attached storage with a “keep-hot” caching model that stores frequently accessed files and evicts “cold” files to third-party S3. With 24TB of training data, the storage was pushed to its limit, so it evicted dataset shards mid-training. This meant fetching them back and creating stalls that slowed throughput.\n\nThe first fix came in the form of swapping the storage method by reserving a spare node with the dataset preloaded and copying using fpsync (s5cmd took double the time). This fixed the issue of a node dying and the replacement GPU having no data since by swapping it with the spare node, training could continue. So, the new spare, not to be wasted, could run evals or dev jobs.\n\nTesting again, they found smaller but still prominent drops in throughput. After experimenting with individual nodes that yielded the same result, they focused on the change in training steps and found that smaller step counts resulted in smaller throughput drops. The nanotron dataloader they were using was growing the lookup table making the training step to the next chunk of tokens to read instead of keeping it bounded or precomputed. Stored in global memory, the growing table causes allocation failures and page faults/worse cache locality. So, they switched to Tokenizedbytes dataloader, solving the throughput issue.\n\nHowever, the loss curve for SmolLM3 looked more noisy. They found the issue with the dataloader because it reads sequences sequentially for each document. Without shuffling of sequences, batches are no longer representative of the overall data distribution, increasing gradient variance. Also, a long file (e.g. code) would supply many consecutive sequences that would also spike loss. To fix, they reshuffled the tokenized sequences offline; an alternative was changing the dataloader to do random access, which has both higher memory usage and slower runtime.\n\nAfter two days and 1T tokens, evals showed that with a similar recipe, SmolLM2 (1.7B) was more performant at the same stage in training as SmolLM3 was. The team found the issue with tensor parallelism: the weights of SmolLM2 fit on a single GPU, whereas for SmolLM3, they had to be shared across 2 GPUs.\n\nFurther, the two TP ranks were initialised with the same random seed instead of different seeds, which causes similar activations/gradients, a loss of diversity of features, and lower convergence.\n\nInference throughput should scale linearly with the number of nodes used. However, Prime found that the standard multi-node data-parallel strategy provided by vLLM didn’t deliver this because as nodes increased, throughput plateaued. They abstracted the multi-client orchestrator so that each inference node is deployed on an independent server (runs its own vLLM engine and scheduler, manages its own KV cache and batches its own requests), and the orchestrator maintains one client per node (avoids single-shared queue bottleneck). Groups rollout requests are distributed across clients according to round-robin scheduling, which keeps utilization balanced.\n\nThere are a few common culprits for training instabilities: high learning rate, bad data, data-parameter state interactions (spikes can come from specific combinations of data batches and model parameter states), poor initialisation (OLMo2 revealed that $\\mathcal{N}(0, 0.02)$ can improve stability upon scaled initialisation), and precision (eww, not fp16).\n\nBesides aforementioned ideas like logit softcapping, z-loss, or QK-norm, data filtering (OLMo2 removed documents with repeated n-grams, specifically those with 32+ repetitions of 1-13 token spans) significantly reduces spike frequency. If spikes still occur, common methods include retraining around the spike by skipping problematic batches or tightening gradient clipping.",

    "fullText": "Narendra Modi’s thirst to supercharge economic growth is matched by US desire to inject AI into world’s biggest democracy\n\nIndia celebrates 80 years of independence from the UK in August 2027. At about that same moment, “early versions of true super intelligence” could emerge, Sam Altman, the co-founder of OpenAI, said this week.\n\nIt’s a looming coincidence that raised a charged question at the AI Impact summit in Delhi, hosted by India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi: can India avoid returning to the status of a vassal state when it imports AI to raise the prospects of its 1.4 billion people?\n\nModi’s hunger to harness AI’s capability is great. He compared it on Thursday to a turning point that resets the direction of civilisation, such as “when the first sparks were struck from stone”. The most common analogy heard among the thousands of visitors to the summit was the dawn of electricity, but Modi was talking about fire.\n\nHis desire to use AI to supercharge Indian economic growth is matched by that of the big US tech companies. OpenAI, Google and Anthropic all played prominent roles at the summit, announcing deals to get ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude AIs into more people’s hands.\n\nThe Trump administration, seeing AI as central to its battle for supremacy with China, was clearing the path for the three AI companies. The US government signed the Pax Silica, a technology agreement that binds India closer to US tech and away from Beijing.\n\nAt the signing, Jacob Helberg, the US under secretary of state for economic affairs, emphasised the threat from China if India should even think about looking elsewhere for its AI. “We have seen the lights of a great Indian city extinguished by a keystroke,” he said, in an apparent reference to a suspected Chinese cyber-attack on Mumbai in 2020.\n\nIndia lacks the semiconductors, power plants and vast gigawatt datacentres to go it alone. In common with most other countries, it faces a choice between US and Chinese AI models. Which they choose could have profound consequences for who controls India’s future, because if AI’s power emerges as predicted, it will not only tweak economic and social structures, but become their new bedrock.\n\nStuart Russell, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of California, Berkeley, who closely follows India’s progress, said: “If we get to AGI [artificial general intelligence], AI is going to be producing 80% of the global economy. All manufacturing, most agriculture, all services will be just done; managed by AI, produced by AI.”\n\nImagine, he said, an Indian village priced out of having a health centre. In the future, AI could design the hospital and “along comes a bunch of giant quad copters carrying the materials, and a bunch of robots come and assemble everything. Two weeks later, you’ve got a hospital.”\n\nIn this scenario, technology becomes integral to a country’s wellbeing. Elements of sovereignty can be fought over, but how successful that will be remains to be seen. AI’s power is such that its controller gains enormous leverage.\n\nAnthropic’s chief executive, Dario Amodei, told the summit: “It may sound absurd, but AI can even help India achieve a standout 25% economic growth.” If that were to happen, it would take India to a per-capita GDP in a decade that is equivalent to Greece today. How could a leader resist?\n\nModi’s tech secretary, Shri Krishnan, said India realised it must ally with like-minded countries to ensure it did not become “enslaved”. It is a high-stakes decision.\n\nIndia appears unlikely to turn to China, for now. It has the AI models, but there are tensions on the Himalayan border, and Chinese companies and leaders were scarce at the summit.\n\nWill India thrive with US AI? Silicon Valley companies talk of cooperation not control. Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s head of global policy, said: “We don’t see India as a customer, we see it as a strategic partner.”\n\nUS officials framed the deal with India as an alliance of two nations that “broke centuries of colonial rule”, and as “two great democracies saying we will build together”.\n\nThe Guardian asked Michael Kratsios, Donald Trump’s science and technology adviser, if India risked being controlled by the US under a form of digital colonialism.\n\n“I would say it is actually the opposite,” he said. “Any country that builds on top of the American AI stack will have the most open, independently controlled, secured stack the world has to offer. And that is why we are soon keen to share it with so many countries that are prioritising their AI sovereignty.”\n\nRussell sees another possibility. “I think the American companies want to get in at that high-school and middle-school level to create basically a bunch of AI addicts who can’t tie their shoelaces without the help of AI,” he said. “Silicon Valley has always been about eyeballs. You monetise later and it works. Google and Facebook generate vast amounts of money.”\n\nCould India build its own AI? It is investing billions in datacentres and semiconductor capacity, but it takes years to come online.\n\nAltman was asked on Thursday how Indian entrepreneurs could build their own AI and his response was blunt. “Look, the way this works is we’re going to tell you it’s totally hopeless to compete with us on training foundation and you shouldn’t even try, and it’s your job to try anyway and I believe both of those things.”\n\nIndia can press US tech companies to adapt their AIs to its kaleidoscope of languages and cultures, and attempt to insist on guardrails. There is much at stake. As the summit came to a close, Joanna Shields, a former Facebook and Google executive and a UK minister for internet safety, warned: “If we have a world where we are accepting models from just the global north, we will lose so much of our cultural diversity, our uniqueness as people, wherever we come from … We don’t want to develop a monoculture based on a handful of models that everybody uses around the world and we lose that richness of who we are, what makes us human.”",

    "description": "No recycling was contaminated in the creation of this post.",
    "fullText": "I was listening to the excellent (now completed) Waste Not Why Not podcast when I first heard the term ‘wishcycling’. If you’re not familiar with the term, wishcycling is basically what happens at the end of any house party comprised of adults in their thirties. In a sincere attempt to be helpful, the attendees will gather all the trash and recycling, so as to not impose on the host too much. However, one person will inevitably misunderstand what constitutes valid recycling and optimistically chuck the dirty pizza box in the recycling pile. The whole batch of recycling is then contaminated, and ends up going to landfill, causing the thing that people wished to avoid in the first place.\n\nAccessibility is really similar to recycling in certain ways. Most people agree that they are both net positives for the world, so many folks want to try their best at it, even if it requires them to take on a bunch of work they might not necessarily be prepared for. This often leads to a problem that I will call ‘wishcessibility.‘\n\nAs I see it, wishcessibility isn’t a single specific bad practice, it’s anything that inadvertently hurts accessibility when you’re trying to improve it.\n\nWishcessibility is when the unpaid, open-source maintainer follows the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide without testing the patterns, thinking that they represent best accessibility practices.\n\nWishcessibility is when the junior developer learns about keyboard-only users for the first time and adds tabindex=“0” to every heading and text node on the page, without anyone in the organization preventing this work from being pushed to production.\n\nWishcessibility is trusting the accessibility advice of an LLM without checking to see if that is how it works in real life.\n\nFull LLM Output\nMe: How does aria-controls help accessibility?\n\nLLM: The aria-controls attribute is part of the WAI-ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) specification, and it plays an important role in accessibility by helping assistive technologies understand relationships between elements.\n\nHow aria-controls Helps Accessibility\n\nWishcessibility might even be when someone installs that accessibility overlay, because they’ve seen it on a dozen other similar sites and they’ve fallen for the flood of marketing lies.\n\nThe common thread here is that wishcessibility, like wishcycling, is always performed by people who want to do the right thing. When a giant corporation decides to whittle their accessibility team down to a single individual with the job title of ‘Resident Sisyphus’, that’s not wishcessibility, that’s just regular ol’ corporate greed. The corporation may or may not be aware that this results in ableism, but the result is the same.\n\nWhile I would normally be somewhat wary of placing too much emphasis on intent over impact, I genuinely believe it is a useful distinction here because it mirrors the career trajectory of many accessibility practitioners I know. Most of them (including me) started with a sincere desire to make things accessible, and some of us were lucky enough to be allowed to fail, over and over again, until the net good of our work became greater than our failures. Having good intent doesn’t cancel out a negative impact, but I believe cultivating that good intent will result in greater accessibility, turning wishcessibility into actual accessibility.\n\nBut as common as that narrative is in my circles, people transcending wishcessibility is quite rare, as inaccessible code and design dominates our industry. It turns out that combatting it is a lot harder than defining it.\n\nMuch of the day to day (and money) in the accessibility industry is driven by a compliance mindset, and this is the inevitable result of the law driving most corporate accessibility efforts. The accessibility practitioners’ standard refrain of ‘it depends’ is not generally acceptable in court, and ultimately, I understand the reasoning behind having measurable, standardized goals, even if it often devolves into box-ticking exercises.\n\n“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”\n\nHowever, as Sherri Byrne-Haber notes in her excellent recent piece ‘Don’t Fall Into the “Accessibility Grade/Score” Trap’, an inherent part of creating standards involves flattening nuance into something reproducible in different contexts. This leads to a proliferation of one-size-fits-all guidance and advice, usually in the form of marketing pieces for different service providers.\n\nWell-meaning developers who want to do the right thing but lack expertise lap up surface-level accessibility content, and the cycle of inaccessibility continues, unfettered by nuance. Without expertise and experience in the practice of accessibility, developers just try to do the best they can with what they’re given. Without organizational support, they don’t have the opportunity to deepen their knowledge, and they can only do so much before the pressures to ship faster inevitably cause harm. I know this, because I’ve been there.\n\nThe reason why it’s so hard to get organizational support for accessibility is that the fundamental core of the field is dealing with the inherent messiness of human beings. It’s a rite of passage in the field to receive user feedback that completely conflicts with standard accessibility practice. Disabled people are humans, and being human means having some unexplainable quirks, like the person I once met who only uses cursive fonts on their phone. Though receiving this kind of feedback doesn’t make for straightforward, actionable product feedback, much of how we practice accessibility today is born of people figuring out how to do accessibility for themselves, regardless of what standards say. We can’t forget that the standards are derived from people’s lived experiences, and not the other way around.\n\nOne sad reality of our current tech hype cycle means that if you asked your boss for $200 to do some testing with disabled users, they would probably say no, but if you asked them for the same $200 to have access to an LLM so you could generate some user personas, they would probably say yes. There’s something safe and comforting about the answer-shaped results of an LLM, real human experiences distilled down to generalizable averages.\n\nBut this is all a farce, a wish, if you will. It’s a lie we tell ourselves to hide the fact that perfect accessibility is actually impossible. The only way to get anywhere close is through systemic support and buy-in so that people can do the gritty, in-the-trenches work of grappling with our shared humanity.\n\nMuch like the person at the party tries to impress their friends by attempting to recycle, we aim for perfect tooling scores, closed issues and well-written reports. The other stuff, the actual user experience is relegated to afterthought. I’m not saying we should throw out the baby with the bathwater and get rid of standards like WCAG. They represent an important baseline (and an achievement!), a necessary starting point before the even harder work begins.\n\nThough I, a perpetual optimist, continue to diligently sort out my waste from my recyclables, I know it’s but a drop in the ocean of what we have to do to fix the harm done to our environment. Similarly, I have no illusions about what this blog post can achieve — I know publishing this won’t suddenly make organizations dedicate what it needs to achieve an accessible internet. I just hope that by publishing this, it gives us some language to talk about why the work of accessibility needs us to think beyond the pixels, the code, the standards and the law, about the actual humans we are solving problems for.\n\n(Thank you Jan Maarten for giving me feedback on this piece!)",

    "fullText": "Reported issues at Amazon Web Services raise questions about firm’s use of artificial intelligence as it cuts staff\n\nAmazon’s huge cloud computing arm reportedly experienced at least two outages caused by its own artificial intelligence tools, raising questions about the company’s embrace of AI as it lays off human employees.\n\nA 13-hour interruption to Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) operations in December was caused by an AI agent, Kiro, autonomously choosing to “delete and then recreate” a part of its environment, the Financial Times reported.\n\nAWS, which provides vital infrastructure for much of the internet, suffered several outages last year.\n\nOne incident, in October, downed dozens of sites for hours and prompted discussion over the concentration of online services on infrastructure owned by a few massive companies. AWS has won 189 UK government contracts worth £1.7bn since 2016, the Guardian reported in October.\n\nThe AI-caused outages were smaller events, said the company, and only one affected customer-facing services.\n\nAmazon confirmed plans to cut 16,000 jobs in January, after it laid off 14,000 staff last October. In January its chief executive, Andy Jassy, reportedly said these cuts were about company culture, and not about replacing workers with AI.\n\nHowever, Jassy has previously said that efficiency gains from AI will reduce Amazon’s workforce in the coming years, and AI agents will allow it to “focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences”.\n\nIn a statement to the Financial Times, Amazon said it was a coincidence that AI tools were involved in the outages, and that there was no evidence that such technology led to more errors than human engineers. “In both instances, this was user error, not AI error,” it said.\n\nAmazon told the Guardian that there was just one incident that had affected AWS, rather than two.\n\nSeveral experts were sceptical of this assessment. A security researcher, Jamieson O’Reilly, said: “While engineering errors caused by traditional tools and humans are not a rare occurrence, the difference between these and mishaps where AI is involved is that ‘without’ AI, a human typically needs to manually type out a set of instructions, and while doing so they have much more time to realise their own error.”\n\nAI agents are often deployed in constrained environments and for specific tasks, O’Reilly said, and cannot understand the broader ramifications of, for example, restarting a system or deleting a database – which may have led to the error at Amazon.\n\n“They don’t have full visibility into the context in which they’re running, how your customers might be affected or what the cost of downtime might be at 2am on a Tuesday,” he said.\n\n“You’ve got to continually remind these tools of the context – ‘hey, this is serious, don’t stuff this up’. And if you don’t do this, it starts to forget about all the other consequences.”\n\nLast year, an AI agent designed by the tech company Replit to build an app deleted an entire company database, fabricated reports, and then lied about its actions.\n\nMichał Woźniak, a cybersecurity expert, said it would be nearly impossible for Amazon to completely prevent internal AI agents from making errors in future, because AI systems make unexpected choices and are extremely complex.\n\n“Amazon never misses a chance to point to ‘AI’ when it is useful to them – like in the case of mass layoffs that are being framed as replacing engineers with AI. But when a slop generator is involved in an outage, suddenly that’s just ‘coincidence’,” he added.\n\nA spokesperson from Amazon said: “This brief event was the result of user error – specifically misconfigured access controls – not AI.”\n\nThey said the “service interruption was an extremely limited event last year” when a tool used to visualise costs for its customers was affected in parts of China.\n\nThey added: “This event didn’t impact compute, storage, database, AI technologies, or any other of the hundreds of services that we run.\n\n“Following these events, we implemented numerous additional safeguards, including mandatory peer review for production access. Kiro puts developers in control – users need to configure which actions Kiro can take, and by default, Kiro requests authorisation before taking any action.”",

    "title": "Justices Strike Down Trump's Tariffs",
    "description": "President Trump was the first to invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to set tariffs on imported goods from more than 100 countries.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that President Trump exceeded his authority when he imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly every U.S. trading partner, a major setback for his administration’s second-term agenda.\n\nThe court’s 6-3 decision has significant implications for the U.S. economy, consumers and the president’s trade policy. The Trump administration had said that a loss at the Supreme Court could force the government to unwind trade deals with other countries and potentially pay hefty refunds to importers.\n\nMr. Trump is the first president to claim that a 1970s emergency statute, which does not mention the word “tariffs,” allowed him to unilaterally impose the duties without congressional approval.\n\nWriting for the majority, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said that statute does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.\n\n“The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope. In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it,” the chief justice wrote.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Brett M. Kavanaugh dissented.\n\nThe decision on Friday left uncertain the extent to which those who paid tariffs might be able to obtain refunds, with Justice Kavanaugh warning that any refund process could be a substantial “mess.”\n\nThe United States “may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid” the tariffs, he wrote, “even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others.”\n\nThe court’s ruling, backed by justices from across the ideological spectrum, was a rare and significant example of the Supreme Court pushing back on Mr. Trump’s agenda. Since he returned to the White House, the court’s conservative majority had overwhelmingly issued emergency orders allowing the president to carry out his policies on a temporary basis. But the decision on Friday will have a more lasting impact.\n\nTwo of Mr. Trump’s appointees — Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett — voted with Chief Justice Roberts and the three liberal justices.\n\nMr. Trump called the Supreme Court’s ruling “a disgrace” while speaking to the nation’s governors on Friday, according to two people familiar with his comments.\n\nEarly last year, Mr. Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to set tariffs on imported goods from more than 100 countries. He said his goal was to reduce the trade deficit and spur more manufacturing in the United States. Since then, he has used the tariffs to raise revenue and to pressure other countries in trade negotiations.\n\nA dozen states and a group of small businesses, including an educational toy manufacturer and a wine importer, sued over the tariffs, saying the president had unlawfully infringed on Congress’s power under the Constitution to impose taxes. The businesses, which rely on imported goods, argued in court filings that the tariffs had disrupted their operations and led to higher prices for consumers and cutbacks in staffing.\n\nPratik Shah, the lead lawyer for the toy company, said in a statement that the justices had “upheld the foundational separation-of-powers principle that our small-business client has been fighting for: no president has boundless power to tax Americans.”\n\nIn court filings and social media posts, the president and his advisers cast the outcome of the Supreme Court case as critical to his trade and foreign policies, making clear he would see defeat as a personal rebuke. Without the emergency power, the solicitor general had warned the justices, there would be economic ruin akin to the Great Depression, in addition to an interruption of trade negotiations and diplomatic embarrassment.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury has collected roughly $240 billion in tariff revenue since April 2, 2025 labeled “Liberation Day,” by President Trump. The research firm Capital Economics estimated that if the Treasury is forced to issue refunds, the cost would run to about $120 billion or 0.5 percent of gross domestic product.\n\nBut even while battling in court, the president began to explore alternatives to the 1977 law. Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator Jamieson Greer said last month that the administration would move quickly to replace any emergency tariffs invalidated by the court with other levies. The president has already used other statutes to set tariffs, including national security-related ones on some specific goods and industries. Still, other laws that more clearly afford the president the power to impose duties are more limited and less flexible than the emergency law.\n\nMr. Trump initially set tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China, Canada and Mexico, saying the levies were a punishment for those nations’ failing to stop the flow of fentanyl. In April, he expanded the duties to imports on goods from nearly all trading partners, saying they were needed to address trade deficits with the rest of the world.\n\nUnder the 1970s-era law, the president has the authority to take certain steps in response to a national emergency to “deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat” to “the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.” That includes the power to “regulate” the “importation” of foreign property. Past presidents have relied on that language to place sanctions or embargoes on other countries, but not to impose taxes. But the administration has argued that phrase also gives Mr. Trump the power to levy tariffs.\n\nThe affected businesses countered that the word “regulate” did not encompass the imposition of tariffs. The statute does not include the words “tariffs,” “taxes” or “duties.”\n\nDuring oral arguments in November, several conservative justices sharply questioned the Trump administration’s lawyer about whether Congress had intentionally delegated to the president broad taxing powers, which the Constitution generally reserves for lawmakers.\n\nIn its 21-page opinion, the majority said it was telling that for half a century, no other president had invoked the statute to impose “any tariffs — let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope.”\n\nThe two words “regulate” and “importation,” the court said, do not give the president the power to “impose tariffs on imports from any country, of any product, at any rate, for any amount of time.”\n\nChief Justice Roberts said the president’s use of the statute had run afoul of the “major questions doctrine,” which requires Congress to use plain and direct language to authorize sweeping economic actions by the executive branch. The court relied on the same doctrine to strike down President Joseph R. Biden’s student loan forgiveness program.\n\nThe three liberal justices agreed with the overall ruling, but insisted the same result could have been reached without applying the doctrine, which they have been critical of in the past.\n\nJustice Neil M. Gorsuch wrote a lengthy and forceful separate opinion agreeing that Mr. Trump had overstepped his authority and defending Congress as the proper branch to impose taxes.\n\n“Yes, legislating can be hard and take time. And, yes, it can be tempting to bypass Congress when some pressing problem arises,” he wrote. “But the deliberative nature of the legislative process was the whole point of its design.”\n\nIn dissent, Justice Kavanaugh said the president should be able to impose tariffs under his power to conduct foreign affairs and noted that they had helped the administration negotiate trade deals worth trillions of dollars.\n\nEven so, Justice Kavanaugh laid out other ways the president could set duties through different federal statutes.\n\n“So the court’s decision is not likely to greatly restrict presidential tariff authority going forward,” he wrote. “But the court’s decision is likely to generate other serious practical consequences in the near term.”\n\nThe case reached the Supreme Court after three lower courts concluded the tariffs were unlawful.\n\nIn August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 7 to 4 that the emergency statute did not authorize the sweeping tariffs while declining to decide whether the statute might allow Mr. Trump to impose more limited duties.\n\n“Whenever Congress intends to delegate to the president the authority to impose tariffs, it does so explicitly,” the appeals court’s majority said.\n\nAbbie VanSickle Tyler Pager and @Patti Cohen contributed reporting.",

    "fullText": "Bitfarms (BITF) is moving its legal base from Canada to the United States and will rebrand as Keel Infrastructure as part of its pivot from bitcoin mining BTC$67,801.44 to data center development for high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.\n\nThe redomiciling process, announced in a Friday press release, will be subject to shareholder, regulatory and court approvals. A shareholder vote is scheduled for March 20, and if approved, the company expects the transition to close by April 1. The new parent company, to be incorporated in Delaware, will trade on the Nasdaq and Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol KEEL.\n\nBitfarms' stock rose 18% following the news, erasing Thursday's 16% tumble as AI infrastructure and crypto stocks sold off.\n\nThe rebrand and relocation follow a year-long strategic review by Bitfarms, which assessed market trends and investor sentiment, CEO Ben Gagnon said. The U.S. move will help the company access a broader pool of capital, simplify its corporate structure, and position it more directly in front of institutional investors, he added.\n\n\"We are no longer a Bitcoin company,\" Gagnon said in a statement, \"We are an infrastructure-first owner and developer for HPC/AI data centers across North America.\n\nTo support its new focus, Bitfarms has begun repaying its $300 million credit facility from Macquarie Group, starting with $100 million tied to its Panther Creek site in Pennsylvania. The repayment reduces debt while preserving what the company says is a strong liquidity position — $698 million as of Feb. 5 — comprised largely of cash and bitcoin.\n\nFollowing the move, Bitfarms will maintain its operational sites in Canada and the U.S., but its New York City office will become its sole headquarters.\n\nDubai takes next step to make real estate flips instant in $16 billion tokenization plan\n\nDubai Land Department and Ctrl Alt move to the next phase of real estate tokenization project, enabling the resale of property tokens.",

    "fullText": "Matthew Ramirez started at Western Governors University as a computer science major in 2025, drawn by the promise of a high-paying, flexible career as a programmer. But as headlines mounted about tech layoffs and AI’s potential to replace entry-level coders, he began to question whether that path would actually lead to a job.\n\nWhen the 20-year-old interviewed for a datacenter technician role that June and never heard back, his doubts deepened. In December, Ramirez decided on what he thought was a safer bet: turning away from computer science entirely. He dropped his planned major to instead apply to nursing school. He comes from a family of nurses, and sees the field as more stable and harder to automate than coding.\n\n“Even though AI might not be at the point where it will overtake all these entry-level jobs now, by the time I graduate, it likely will,” Ramirez said.\n\nRamirez is not alone in reshaping his career out of anxiety over AI. As students like him are reconsidering their majors over concerns that AI may disrupt their employment prospects, more established workers – some with decades of experience – are rethinking their trajectories because they’re encountering AI at work and share the same unease. Some workers are eschewing it entirely; others are embracing it.\n\nIt’s not clear when AI will become advanced enough to replace certain white-collar workers and just how many jobs it will be capable of taking over. But jitters around its potential impact are already pushing people to change course, reshaping the labor market before automation fully arrives.\n\nWhat is clear is why workers are feeling on edge. The World Economic Forum projects that AI could displace 92m roles worldwide by 2030, including many white-collar positions. In the US, employers cited AI as a factor in nearly 55,000 job cuts in 2025, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a consulting firm, as job seekers navigate a tougher market.\n\nWhile AI is still just one factor among many that are leading to layoffs, ADP, the largest payroll company in the US, found that professional and business services roles, alongside information services jobs in media, telecom and IT, collectively lost 41,000 jobs in December 2025. In that same month, employment grew in healthcare, education and hospitality, per the firm’s data.\n\nMany of those white-collar roles involve writing, data analysis and coding – tasks generative AI tools can increasingly perform. Hands-on, people-facing work remains less exposed.\n\nJobs that emphasize interpersonal and hands-on skills are increasingly appealing to young people who are wary of automation, according to Dr Jasmine Escalera, a career development expert at Zety, a professional development platform.\n\nShe pointed to research showing that 43% of gen Z workers who are anxious about AI are moving away from entry-level corporate and administrative roles and toward careers that rely on what she calls “human skills”, including creativity, interpersonal connection and hands-on expertise.\n\nIn that same report, 53% of young respondents said they were seriously considering blue-collar or skilled trade work. Escalera said it was a move that workers were making to reduce their exposure to AI and one that the Wall Street Journal, the paper of record of white-collar work, had recently urged its readers to consider.\n\nBut the pivot may come with sacrifices. Many of the white-collar roles that workers worry could be automated – from software development to financial analysis – are paid median salaries well above $75,000 a year, with developers raking in about $133,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Blue-collar jobs pay less. Many skilled trades, like electricians and plumbers, receive closer to $60,000 a year. These types of jobs also often require in-person work, physical labor and less predictable schedules – all trade-offs workers may accept in their attempts to future-proof their careers.\n\nFor some job seekers, any mention of AI is a red flag in job listings, so they’re skipping them entirely.\n\nAfter getting laid off last January, Roman Callaghan, 30, spent nine months hunting for his next job. As a medical coder at a medication access firm for four years, Callaghan handled administrative tasks like calling insurance providers and entering medical data. After his employer started rolling out AI across the company to streamline workflows, he wondered whether the move would one day affect his job. When he was laid off two years later, he suspected his fears had come true, though his employer didn’t specifically cite AI as a reason.\n\nWhen he looked for new work, he avoided any roles that mentioned phrases like “integrating AI”, “AI-first” or “developing AI” in job descriptions. Callaghan wanted a new job, but his AI anxiety steered him away from roles that now felt short-term to him. He just didn’t want to risk being laid off again because a future employer would eventually use AI to cull its ranks.\n\nIn the past nine months, he said, he applied to at least 100 jobs across data entry, medical coding, call centers and paralegal work, while deliberately skipping 30 to 40 postings that referenced AI. While he searched, he took odd gigs to make ends meet, first at a local fish store and later at a call center. He stayed there until mid-October, when he landed a data entry job.\n\nAvoiding AI-centric jobs “felt like it narrowed the amount of companies I could work for”, Callaghan said. “Even though my options were limited, sticking to my convictions felt worth it.”\n\n​​Recruiters say that kind of avoidance is becoming more common. Marshall Scabet, the CEO of Precision Sales Recruiting, which helps manufacturers hire sales professionals, said that roughly a quarter of sales candidates he spoke with over the past six months were trying to pivot away from software-as-a-service (SaaS) jobs.\n\nMany clients told him they worried their tech sales roles could be replaced by AI, Scabet said, and believed selling industrial equipment was safer from automation. Doing so, he said, requires building human relationships with vendors.\n\n“In their opinion, there was less likelihood of that job being taken by AI,” Scabet said. “AI isn’t just going to walk into a factory and give a pitch about a machine.”\n\nFor more experienced workers, their encounters with AI in the workplace are pushing them to reconsider entire industries or build new skill sets.\n\nLiam Robinson, a 45-year-old animation artist, says he is actively avoiding jobs in the mobile gaming industry he has worked in for more than a decade. In his last role as an art director, his employer encouraged staff to use generative AI to speed up production. Robinson, who refused to use AI in his own work, said he watched the quality of animation suffer around him as his colleagues began relying on the tech.\n\nLast September, after disclosing in a self-evaluation survey that he wasn’t using AI, Robinson was laid off. It left him disillusioned with the direction of the industry. He believes AI flattens creativity, erodes craftsmanship and hurts the environment, fueling his resistance to work for companies building or deploying it.\n\nHe is not actively applying for new roles and instead is focused on creating webtoon comics. But if money runs dry, he said, he would take on other work, from driving for Uber to trash disposal. “As long as I’m useful and making a little money, that’s enough,” Robinson said.\n\nAs professionals like Robinson confront the possibility that skills they spent years mastering are no longer highly valued, many are redefining what stability looks like, according to Arianny Mercedes, founder of the career strategy firm Revamped.\n\nRather than chasing prestige or high salaries, Mercedes said her job-seeking clients increasingly prioritize roles tied to regulated or essential parts of an organization, such as healthcare administration, education or compliance.\n\n“The objective isn’t to avoid AI,” Mercedes said. “It’s to be in roles where AI changes the tools of work without undermining authority or decision-making.”\n\nFor others, the safest response to AI is to lean into it.\n\nAfter designing and developing websites for four years, Dmitry Zozulya decided to leave his work behind. As AI tools have proliferated and make it possible to code and create branding at a fraction of what it used to cost, the 29-year-old found it increasingly difficult to sell website and landing page work.\n\nInstead, Zozulya began offering AI-driven automation services, helping businesses streamline workflows. He now runs a small consultancy while building personal projects to deepen his experience.\n\n“I believe it’s very important to adapt,” Zozulya said. “Even when it’s uncomfortable.”\n\nWhether the rise of AI is steering workers away from entire industries or just certain roles, it is disrupting many people’s calculus for what their future at work will look like – and it’s happening abruptly.\n\nFor Ramirez, that recalculation began before he had even entered the workforce. He believes switching from computer science to nursing means he’ll find work after graduation, even if it means letting go of the future he once imagined.\n\n“When you throw AI into the picture, the likelihood of healthcare jobs disappearing is slim as of right now,” Ramirez said. “I can’t speak for the future, but in the next few years, they’re still going to be there.”",

It's a fantastic club. I am very focused to do the right things.\n\n\"It is not about systems. It is important to become a team, a group, who will look after each other.

There is potential.\"\n\nDespite coming fourth in the league phase of the Champions League to jump straight into the last 16, Tottenham have struggled in the Premier League.\n\nSince November, they have only won two of 17 league matches, with six draws and nine defeats. Their last league victory was a 1-0 success at Crystal Palace on 28 December and they have collected only four out of a possible 24 points in 2026.\n\nSpurs, who finished 17th last season, have been in the top flight of English football in every campaign since one year in the old Second Division in 1977-78.\n\nAsked how confident he was Tottenham would still be in the Premier League next season, Tudor replied \"100%\".\n\nHis first game is at home on Sunday against bitter rivals and current leaders Arsenal, with Spurs facing an injury crisis.\n\n\"It's a very rare situation,\" added Tudor. \"We have 10 injuries, we trained with 13 players.\n\n\"It is an even bigger challenge to succeed from this situation. My first goal is that we become a team in the right meaning of the word, that suffers when it needs to suffer, to fight, to run, to have the right mentality.

    "fullText": "The Scottish Premiership looks certain to have only one Champions League place after next season.\n\nThe wide-ranging impact of its clubs' underperforming in European competition will also see Scotland's overall allocation reduced from five teams to four.\n\nIt will become more difficult to reach the league phase, too, as all teams must enter qualifying in earlier rounds.\n\nAnd there could be financial impact on the whole of the Scottish game.\n\nCeltic, the last active Scottish club in European competition this term, suffered a 4-1 defeat at home to Stuttgart in the first leg of their Europa League knockout play-off round tie on Thursday.\n\nIf the elimination of Martin O'Neill's team is confirmed after next Thursday's return leg in Germany, Scotland's fate will be sealed.\n\nThe Uefa coefficient ranks the average performance of each country's clubs in Europe over a rolling five-year period.\n\nScotland has enjoyed two places in the Champions League for six seasons.\n\nOnly once, in 2022-23, have both Celtic and Rangers made it through qualifying to play in the competition proper.\n\nBut in all six seasons both were at least in the Europa League.\n\nScotland had been ranked as high as ninth between 2021 and 2023, granting the title winners direct access to the Champions League group stage.\n\nBut there has been a gradual decline since then. Last year Scotland went from two places to one in the Europa League.\n\nIt has now dropped from 14th to 18th in the Uefa coefficient. Only the top 15 nations get two Champions League spots and later qualifying round access.\n\nFootball finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport it \"will have significant financial consequences\".\n\nTaking part in the Champions League is worth a minimum of £16.6m. Each victory is then worth £1.75m and a draw £610,000.\n\n\"Celtic made more than £40m from the Champions League in 2024-25,\" said Maguire. \"And that's before you take into account some of the ancillary benefits from matchday revenues, sold-out stadiums and sponsor bonuses.\n\n\"For every one pound you earn in the Champions League, you get approximately 22p in the Europa League and 11p in the Conference League.\n\n\"It is a sizeable difference, and that would be a restriction for whoever finishes second.\"\n\nThis season's Scottish Premiership runners-up will still enter the Champions League in the second qualifying round.\n\nIf they win their first qualifier they are guaranteed Europa League football at minimum.\n\nThis will change as of 2026-27.\n\nSecond place will by right only earn a spot in the second qualifying round of the Conference League.\n\nThe Scottish Cup carries a place in the Europa League, which would pass to the runners-up if the winners finished in the top two.\n\nBut that is going be in the first qualifying round in mid-July, two rounds earlier than this season and four ties from the league phase.\n\nIt will become harder for the champions, too.\n\nPresently, they join in the play-off round and only need to win one tie to make the Champions League. Lose it and they are guaranteed a spot in the Europa League.\n\nNext season's champions are set to enter in the second qualifying round in 2027-28, meaning they must win three ties to reach the league phase.\n\nThere is no automatic Europa League safety net, either.\n\nIt will be possible for the champions to lose in consecutive qualifying rounds of all three competitions.\n\nThat would be in the second round of the Champions League, third round of the Europa League and then the play-off round of the Conference League.\n\nThe champions could miss out on league-phase football altogether.\n\nCyprus and Denmark are set to be the beneficiaries, with their coefficient boosted this season by their best ever European campaigns.\n\nThey will receive two places in the Champions League instead, with Austria the other country to fall out of the top 15.\n\nSchmeichel in spotlight after night of gloom for Celtic\n\nCeltic's O'Neill seeks 'utopia' after Euro setback\n\nIs England on course for fifth Champions League spot?",

    "fullText": "Major restaurant chains, including KFC, have ditched a commitment to improve chicken sourcing standards in the UK as poultry demand soars.\n\nEight restaurant groups, which also include the owners of Burger King and Nando's, have left the Better Chicken Commitment (BCC), in which they pledged to stop using fast-growing chickens, for an industry-led plan without that commitment.\n\nAnimal welfare groups say fast-growing \"franken-chickens\" mature quicker but also have higher rates of premature death and muscle disease.\n\nTrade body UKHospitality said the industry-led plan will help restaurant firms reduce emissions and meet surging demand for the lean protein while ensuring secure supply chains.\n\nAllen Simpson, CEO of UKHospitality, which represents some of the restaurant brands who have withdrawn from the BCC, said despite the change the businesses are \"committed to enhancing their ongoing work across welfare and the environment\".\n\nThe eight businesses, owning or franchising 18 leading restaurant chains, have instead joined the industry-led Sustainable Chicken Forum (SCF).\n\nSome of the brands include include Popeyes, Wingstop, and Wagamama.\n\nThe SCF said businesses \"no longer believe the BCC is the right framework to drive the next phase of progress on welfare due to the requirement to source only slower-growing breeds\".\n\nIt argued that farming slower-growing breeds produce more greenhouse gas emissions than farming faster-growing breeds.\n\nUKHospitality said the SCF will focus on increasing welfare while limiting the environmental impact of chicken farming and keeping up with demand.\n\nKFC in 2024 said it was rescinding its commitment to phase out buying fast-growing chicken, but the decision on Thursday withdrew from the Better Chicken Commitment entirely.\n\nThe BBC understands the famous chicken chain owned by Yum Brands buys about 4% of the UK chicken supply. An industry source said there is not yet a large enough supply of slower-growing poultry in the UK.\n\nHowever, animal welfare group Anima International said the change was \"about money and nothing else\".\n\nIts UK chief executive Connor Jackson said the companies' explanation for leaving is rubbish.\n\n\"Franken-chickens pose the most serious animal welfare problem in the UK,\" Jackson said.\n\nHe said that chicken farmers and poultry companies would produce more slower-growing, higher-welfare chickens according to orders.\n\n\"This is why the supply isn't there for them now: producers won't do it unless they have a contract in place because they are more expensive,\" he said.\n\nClaire Williams, campaigns manager at The Humane League UK, said it was clear to her animal welfare group why the chicken outlets had switched membership.\n\n\"Major food companies, with the combined worth of many billions of pounds, have decided that their profit margins cannot be threatened,\" Williams said.\n\n\"The Better Chicken Commitment was designed by scientists to help animals - the Sustainable Chicken Forum is a welfare-washing, PR-stunt designed to deflect criticism, and let these companies claim they are doing enough\".\n\nRichard Griffiths, head of the British Poultry Council, which represents poultry breeders and processors, said the news was \"most welcome\".\n\nHe said that at a time of higher production costs and slow planning approvals the industry did not need added costs.\n\nAlthough there has been a surge in the number of takeaway chicken shops in the UK in recent years, British supermarkets remain the major purchasers of poultry.\n\nRetailers such as M&S and Waitrose and cafe chains Pret and Greggs remain members of the BCC.\n\nHen cages and pig farrowing crates face ban\n\nHow Britain became a fried chicken nation",

    "fullText": "MAGA’s hate machine is—at least temporarily—sputtering.\n\nOn Monday, late-night host Stephen Colbert attempted to interview Texas Senate hopeful James Talarico. Instead of this being a routine nothing-to-write-home-about few minutes chat with a little-known Texas state representative, Colbert ran into a legal wall: CBS’s attorneys told the broadcaster to pull the interview after Trump’s FCC argued that late-night-show interviews of political candidates from one party but not the other violate federal regulations. The network allegedly advised the host that he shouldn’t even discuss on-air that it had put the kibosh on the interview.\n\nColbert wasn’t amused. Not only did he proceed to talk about it on the air; he interviewed Talarico and posted it on YouTube, where, within two days, the clip had garnered some 7.8 million views.\n\nA week ago, polls showed Representative Jasmine Crockett leading Talarico by eight points. If Talarico ends up winning his primary in Texas and then goes on to win the general election against the front-runner to be the GOP’s nominee, Texas’s far-right attorney general, Ken Paxton—who avoided a likely conviction for securities fraud two years ago by taking a plea bargain and agreeing to do community service—he will have Trump’s anti–First Amendment FCC to thank for his meteoric rise to national prominence.\n\nPolling conducted before the Colbert interview of a hypothetical Talarico-Paxton matchup shows the race to be a toss-up. And now CBS’s pandering to the Trump administration over the Colbert interview has given the Democrat a crucial publicity boost just as early voting in the March 3 primaries gets underway. Indeed, many of the more than 65,000 commenters on the YouTube video specifically thanked the FCC for bringing the interview, and the candidate, to their attention.\n\n“A threat to any of our First Amendment rights is a threat to all of our First Amendment rights,” Talarico explained to Colbert, in reacting to the attempts to censor him. The audience roared its approval. For the next 14 minutes, Talarico hit rhetorical home run after home run, denouncing the hypocrisies of Christian Nationalism—“people baptizing their partisanship and calling that Christianity”—attacking the xenophobia of the MAGA movement, and explaining how the real fight in America is “not left versus right; it’s top versus bottom.” That’s as succinct a summary of the problem of oligarchy as any I have heard.\n\nOver the last few weeks, there has been something remarkably ham-handed and asinine about the authoritarianism that Trump 2.0 is serving up. The ambition remains. The administration is still trying to curtail free speech, chill political participation, and take over election processes in the run-up to the November vote, but some of the enthusiasm and efficiency of the administration that we saw last year seems to have at least temporarily dissipated.\n\nSince the Department of Homeland Security announced that the ICE surge in Minneapolis was ending, Stephen Miller, the most outspoken proponent of Trump’s might-is-right worldview, has been remarkably silent. Greg Bovino, the Gestapo-trenchcoat-wearing public face of ICE, has largely vanished from view. (Bovino was last seen with some drinking buddies being unceremoniously kicked out of a bar on the Las Vegas strip.)\n\nKristi Noem also went largely silent, though in her case she couldn’t quite go a whole week without doing something blitheringly stupid, entirely offensive, cruel, or patently unconstitutional. At a press conference, she announced that the blizzard of federal investigations into alleged voter fraud were intended to “make sure we have the right people voting, electing the right leaders to lead this country.” Someone apparently forgot to give her the memo that you don’t say the really undemocratic stuff out loud. And later in the week, the Department of Homeland Security sent out a memo announcing that refugees in the United States who hadn’t gotten their green card within one year of arrival would be subject to arrest and detention. As for Trump’s lapdog attorney general, Pam Bondi, after the debacle of her congressional hearing, she has apparently decided to hide under the tranche of Epstein documents that, drip by drip, leak by leak, are corroding what remains of the integrity of the Department of Justice.\n\nEven Trump’s social media presence has become tired and formulaic. When Winter Olympics athlete Hunter Hess said that representing Trump’s United States “brings up mixed emotions,” the narcissist in chief took time out from his busy day to post on Truth Social, “U.S. Olympic Skier, Hunter Hess, a real Loser, says he doesn’t represent his Country in the current Winter Olympics. If that’s the case, he shouldn’t have tried out for the Team, and it’s too bad he’s on it. Very hard to root for someone like this. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nThe post was so boring that Hess didn’t even mention Trump in his reply. “There is so much that is great about America, but there are always things that could be better,” the athlete wrote. “One of the many things that makes this country so amazing is that we have the right and the freedom to point that out.” Apparently, in between his training sessions on the mountains of the Pacific Northwest, Hess attended the high school civics lesson on the First Amendment that the Trump team all skipped out on.\n\nOf course, by next week the sundowning authoritarian may have pushed the United States into an avoidable forever war with the Iranians, and with the help of GOP governors in key states such as Texas and Florida, he may have escalated his efforts to sabotage the midterm elections. In fact, if I were a betting man, I’d say the odds were pretty high on both of those fronts. But given the horrors we are living through, I’ll take small graces where I can. For now, at least some of the air seems to have gone out of Trump—and when push comes to shove, a deflated, tired Trump, despite all the military hardware at his fingertips, is simply a nasty, trash-talking, increasingly addled old man.",

    "fullText": "The Boss’s most political tour yet will go from Minneapolis to Washington.\n\nAlmost a quarter of a century ago, in the second year of George W. Bush’s miserable presidency, a campaign was launched to draft Bruce Springsteen as a candidate for one of New Jersey’s US Senate seats. Polls showed that Springsteen would be a viable contender, and volunteers were ready to circulate the petitions, put his name on the ballot and send the Boss to Washington.\n\nBut the musician thwarted the drive, announcing, “If nominated, I will not run. If elected, I will not serve.”\n\nThat ended the 2002 bid to draw the Boss into electoral politics. But Springsteen did not relegate himself to the political sidelines. He’s since been one of the highest-profile advocates for Democratic presidential candidates, from John Kerry to Barack Obama to Kamala Harris. And Springsteen’s songs in recent decades have maintained his career-long commitment to address the fundamental issues of our times, with impassioned lyrics about everything from the failed response to Hurricane Katrina (“We Take Care of Our Own”) to the economic pain that extends from after deindustrialization (“Death to My Hometown”).\n\nDonald Trump’s second presidential term has made Springsteen more outspoken than ever—and given his interventions a new urgency. He has often emerged as a more clear-eyed and impactful critic of the president’s dangerous abuses of power than the Democratic Party leaders who are supposed to be running an opposition party.\n\nNow the rocker is hitting the road for the Land of Hopes and Dreams American Tour, which is likely to be the most politically charged show of his 50-plus-year career.\n\nEven if Springsteen was saying nothing about the purpose of the tour he will launch on March 31, the schedule sends an explicit message. The tour kicks off in Minneapolis, where a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed poet and mother Renee Good before Customs and Border Protection agents gunned down intensive care nurse Alex Pretti. (Springsteen responded in January to the deadly violence of ICE’s surge into Minnesota with the bestselling song, “Streets of Minneapolis,” which is all but certain to feature in his shows.) The tour’s next stops will be in Portland and Los Angeles, two other communities that have been targeted by surges of armed and masked agents from Secretary Kristi Noem’s Department of Homeland Security.\n\nBut Springsteen is saying something. Leaning against a parked car in a video released this week, Springsteen announced the tour with a full-throated call to action:\n\n“Brothers and sisters, fans, friends and good folk from coast to coast. We are living through dark, disturbing and dangerous times, but do not despair—the cavalry is coming! Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band will be taking the stage this spring from Minneapolis to California to Texas to Washington, DC, for the Land of Hope and Dreams American Tour. We will be rocking your town in celebration and in defense of America—American democracy, American freedom, our American Constitution, and our sacred American dream—all of which are under attack by our wannabe king and his rogue government in Washington, DC. Everyone, regardless of where you stand or what you believe in, is welcome—so come on out and join the United Free Republic of E Street Nation for an American spring of Rock ’n’ Rebellion! I’ll see you there!”\n\nSpringsteen has long written about the anguish and abandonment of Americans in hard times, once explaining, “There ain’t no help, the cavalry stayed home. There ain’t no one hearing the bugle blown.\nWe take care of our own…” But this time he says, “Do not despair, the cavalry is coming!”—and he’s leading it all the way to Washington, where the tour will finish on May 27 with a huge outdoor concert at Nationals Park.\n\nThat doesn’t sit well with the Trump White House, which issued a statement suggesting that the tour by “this loser Springsteen” would go nowhere. But Springsteen fans who know a thing or two about politics were secure in their faith that the Boss will draw a crowd—for his music, and his politics.\n\nPredicting that Springsteen would bring “a Rock-and-Roll Exorcism to Washington, D.C.,” US Representative Jamie Raskin (D-MD) said, “America has no kings, but we’ve got one Boss and his name is Bruce Springsteen. Unlike our faux-King, the Boss fights for freedom and democracy for everyone. I cannot wait to hear him sing ‘Streets of Minneapolis’ loud enough to rattle the walls of what’s left of the White House.”\n\nUS Representative Bob Menendez, a Democrat who represents Springsteen’s native New Jersey, simply announced, “An American spring of Rock ‘n’ Rebellion is what the country needs in this moment and I am here for it. “",

    "fullText": "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe will not be charged by the Football Association over a controversial interview in which he claimed the United Kingdom had been \"colonised by immigrants\".\n\nThe governing body has issued him with a reminder of his responsibilities as a participant in English football when taking part in media interviews.\n\nHowever, the FA will not be taking any further action. It had been examining whether the comments had brought the game into disrepute.\n\nThe comments were widely condemned, including by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and all United's leading supporter groups.\n\nRatcliffe did offer a qualified apology, while United released their own statement highlighting the inclusivity initiatives they are part of.\n\nRatcliffe, Man Utd and the immigration comments fallout\n\nRatcliffe sorry language 'offended some' after immigration comments\n\nStarmer tells Sir Jim Ratcliffe to apologise for saying UK 'colonised by immigrants'\n\nEarlier on Friday, Manchester United interim boss Michael Carrick said he was \"proud of what the club stands for\" at a pre-match news conference.\n\n\"I'm proud of what the club stands for and has done for so long,\" said Carrick. \"I'm really aware of that.\n\n\"Sir Jim made his statement and the club made a statement on the back of it. It is not my place to add to that.\n\n\"What I can say is that I have been around this club many years.\n\n\"Equality and diversity and respect for each other is something we look to carry through every day.\n\n\"I have travelled the world and know what this club means to an awful lot of people.\n\n\"I am fully aware of the responsibility, and we try to carry that out every day. I am proud of what the club stands for and has done for so long.\"\n\nCarrick, who has been installed as head coach for the remainder of the season after Ruben Amorim's dismissal, wore a distinctive green Unite for Access badge.\n\nThe organisation aims to raise awareness and \"drive equality for a more inclusive matchday experience for disabled sports fans\".\n\n\"I think part of being at this club is that we understand what it's like globally and the responsibilities we have within this,\" Carrick added.\n\n\"I can only speak from my personal experiences of being here for a long time with various managers, with various staff.\n\n\"The supporters have largely probably stayed the same but we have gathered some new ones over the years, from all different backgrounds. It's something we're fully aware of and I am.\"\n\nManaging Man Utd the 'ultimate role' - Carrick\n\nAs a player, Carrick was part of a multi-cultural dressing room.\n\nFormer United manager Sir Alex Ferguson highlighted that diversity as a key weapon in his side's success.\n\nNow Carrick has to manage a group drawn from 16 countries.\n\nIn addition, across the women's and youth teams there are players from as far afield as Mali and Japan.\n\nHe is confident Ratcliffe's comment will not undermine unity at a time when United are pushing for Champions League qualification - something that appeared unlikely a couple of months ago.\n\n\"We have a really strong group. Whether that is the players in and around the dressing room, the staff and around the club, and outside of the club,\" Carrick said.\n\n\"But certainly, inside the club we're in constant communication and we're here to support and help in whatever way we can.\"\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Cuesta College just acquired property for a permanent South County campus, and it’s a well-known building to local residents.\n\nCollege spokesperson Ritchie Bermudez confirmed that the San Luis Obispo County Community College District — the local board that governs the college — has purchased the former Rite Aid building in Arroyo Grande as part of its “long-term planning efforts.”\n\nThe building is located at 1650 E Grand Ave., on the corner of Oak Park Boulevard.\n\nWhen it opens, the South County center will mark the third permanent Cuesta campus. The college currently has its flagship campus off Highway 1 in San Luis Obispo and its North County campus in Paso Robles.\n\nThe Tribune asked Cuesta about a timeline for the campus opening but did not immediately receive a response as of Thursday.\n\n“The college is currently working through the appropriate processes and coordinating closely with the city of Arroyo Grande and local partners,” Bermudez said. “We look forward to sharing more information and will ensure the community is the first to know once those steps have been completed.”\n\nCuesta has long sought to expand its offerings in southern SLO County.\n\nCuesta has served students through a leased location at Arroyo Grande High School since 1965, according to a 2024 document.\n\nBut the success of dual credit enrollment among South County residents also highlighted barriers students faced when trying to access Cuesta’s SLO campus, like fuel costs and traffic, the document said.\n\n“In consideration of increasing access to instructional programs in the South County region, Cuesta College is exploring programming and location options to meet the needs of the local residents, businesses and agriculture community,” the document said.\n\nThe 2024 plan estimated that a leased storefront location acquired by Cuesta could serve around 378 full-time, in-person students, and up to 700 full-time students in a hybrid format.\n\nThe newly purchased Arroyo Grande location sits at about 16,320 square feet, according to an online real estate listing.\n\nLee & Associates broker Austin Jackson said the sale from a private party closed on Feb. 13, with the seller saying they felt good that the deal would be beneficial for the community.\n\nRite Aid began shuttering its local stores after the national chain declared bankruptcy in May, The Tribune previously reported. The Grand Avenue location’s closure was scheduled for July 27.\n\n“Right now there is very little commercial retail activity,” Jackson said, “but this offer was the best we saw right now.”\n\nWhile the timeline for the South County center’s opening was not immediately available, it’s likely the new location will allow Cuesta to serve more students in the South County region with accessible and affordable educational opportunities.\n\n“Our priority remains serving students and expanding access to educational opportunities in a thoughtful and collaborative manner,” Cuesta President Jill Stearns said through a spokesperson.",

    "fullText": "Think of a forest and most people will envision lush landscapes with rows of tall trees all around.\n\nA forest can also be a place where people find 200-million-year-old fossils of ancient trees from the Triassic period that hardened and crystallized over time.\n\nPetrified Forest National Park in Arizona lands under that second category — the one lacking in tall trees — may explain why it ranked on a survey as one of America's most disappointing national parks.\n\nThe survey, published by the outdoor retailer KÜHL and based on about 96,000 reviews of national parks on Tripadvisor and Google, ranked Petrified Forest the second-most disappointing park, just behind Death Valley National Park in California.\n\nPetrified Forest has received plenty of bad reviews over the years. \"My husband is a wood lover and even he was sorry we came,\" read a review from Tripadvisor user Travlingal51.\n\nWe'd argue it's still worth a trip. But more on that later.\n\nPetrified Forest ranks so high on the disappointment survey — a list that also includes Zion in Utah, Mammoth Cave in Kentucky and Denali in Alaska — because travelers think the park's name suggests a massive forest, \"but instead they find mostly logs lying scattered across the badlands,\" said Ivan Slovic, a content writer for KÜHL who wrote about the survey results.\n\n\"A lot of visitors say it feels 'underwhelming' or 'just a bunch of rocks and logs,' especially if they’re only stopping for 30 to 60 minutes on their way along Route 66, as if that's all there is to it,\" Slovic said.\n\n\"Most people roll in expecting something instantly jaw-dropping like the photos they’ve seen online, and when it doesn’t hit like that, they leave feeling let down,\" he said.\n\nSome disappointments in visits to Petrified Forest are offset by overwhelmingly positive ratings from users of the same review sites. The park has an average rating of 4.7 out of 5 on both Google and Tripadvisor.\n\nVisitors who left positive reviews of Petrified Forest talked about marveling over the petrified wood along the forest trails and the colors of the mesas along the Painted Desert. Some reviewers also cited the history behind the Painted Desert Inn and the friendliness of park rangers in their reviews.\n\nWorld Atlas named Petrified Forest one of the nine best road trips to take in Arizona, highlighting it as a uniquely Arizonan destination.\n\nThe National Park Service describes Petrified Forest as \"a surprising land of scenic wonders and fascinating science\" with one of the largest and most colorful concentrations of petrified wood in the world.\n\nThe park service called attention to it in a social media post, which received more than 62,000 likes on Instagram, that referenced the lyrics of Gloria Gaynor's hit song \"I Will Survive\" — \"At first I was a tree, now I’m petrified. Thinking all my wooden rings had turned to stone inside.\"\n\nDon't listen to the haters, Petrified Forest National Park is well-worth a visit. Just don't go expecting to see towering pine trees.\n\nDeath Valley National Park, California.\n\nPetrified Forest National Park, Arizona.\n\nWind Cave National Park, South Dakota.\n\nMammoth Cave National Park, Kentucky.\n\nEverglades National Park, Florida.\n\nDenali National Park & Preserve, Alaska.\n\nGreat Basin National Park, Nevada.\n\nMesa Verde National Park, Colorado.\n\nGuadalupe Mountains National Park, Texas.\n\nTSA PreCheck or CLEAR?

    "fullText": "Nine U.S. fighter jets have been scrambled to intercept five Russian warplanes spotted off Alaska.\n\nThe North American Aerospace Defense Command, based at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado, said it had detected and tracked two Tu-95 long-range strategic bombers, two Su-35 fighter planes, and one A-50 spy plane crossing Alaska’s coastal Air Defense Identification Zone Thursday.\n\nNORAD said it had responded by launching two F-16s, two F-35s, one E-3, and four KC-135s to intercept the planes, positively identify them, and escort them out of the ADIZ.\n\nThe command described Russian activity in the ADIZ as a regular occurrence that is not typically considered a threat, adding that the five planes had not crossed into U.S. or Canadian airspace, according to CBS News.\n\nAlaska’s ADIZ is the point at which American and Canadian jurisdiction ends and is a “defined stretch of international airspace that requires the ready identification of all aircraft in the interest of national security,” NORAD said.\n\nA similar occurrence took place last September, when two Tu-95s and two Su-35s were spotted in the same zone, prompting the defense command to send out an E-3 early warning and control aircraft, followed by four F-16s and four KC-135 tanker planes to lead them clear.\n\nNORAD said at that time that although the presence of Russian craft in the ADIZ is a common sight and non-aggressive, it could be interpreted as a test of U.S. and Nato preparedness.\n\nA month earlier, a Cold War-era Russian IL-20 COOT military reconnaissance aircraft was spotted four times in the course of one week.\n\nPrior to that, in September 2024, NORAD posted a short video online of a Russian jet flying just a matter of feet away one of its own planes.\n\nEarlier that summer, Russian and Chinese planes jointly entered the ADIZ, which a U.S. defense official told CBS marked the first time Beijing had ever encroached on Alaska.\n\nRelations between Washington and Moscow remain uneasy at present as President Donald Trump attempts to thrash out a peace deal to bring an end to the war in Ukraine, as the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion of its western neighbor draws near.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has insisted he is open to a solution to the war and met with Trump in Alaska last year, but has so far refused to commit without major territorial concessions, which Ukraine has refused to grant, to the evident frustration of the Americans.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has meanwhile torn into Putin after the latest round of negotiations in Geneva failed to achieve a breakthrough, dismissing his claims to the Donbas, Crimea and other disputed regions as “historical s***.”",

    "fullText": "To stay up to date with all Jurisprudence news, please \n\nThe Supreme Court struck down Donald Trump’s sweeping “emergency” tariffs on Friday, ruling 6–3 that they far exceed what federal law allows. With its decision in Learning Resources v. Trump, the court wiped out Trump’s signature economic agenda, a withering rebuke to a president who has insisted that these tariffs are foundational to the success of his second term. Chief Justice John Roberts’ opinion for the court sends the blunt message that Trump should not expect SCOTUS to rubber-stamp all of his expansions of executive power, no matter how much political pressure he puts on the justices. This rejoinder may be surprising given the Republican-appointed supermajority’s previous tolerance for the president’s assertions of king-like authority. But as Roberts’ crisp, confident opinion explains, allowing the president to impose taxes unilaterally—at least without clear congressional authority—is an existential threat to the very “existence and prosperity” of the nation.\n\nIn truth, Trump’s tariffs were always on shaky legal ground, no matter how confidently the White House insisted they were permissible. The president claimed the freedom to impose tariffs on any nation, of any amount, for as long as he wished, based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. But IEEPA does not mention tariffs, duties, taxes, or anything else that would hint at Congress’ desire to delegate tariff authority to the executive branch. Instead, it allows the president to “regulate” foreign “importation” to “deal with” an “unusual and extraordinary threat” abroad. Trump’s Justice Department insisted that he could “regulate” “importation” by slapping any tariff on any country he wanted. And it claimed two different “emergencies” that justified these duties: a long-standing trade imbalance with many other nations, and the smuggling of fentanyl into the United States.\n\nRoberts—joined by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson—rejected this interpretation. All six justices agreed on the bottom-line conclusion that “those words cannot bear such weight.” As the chief explained, the Constitution assigns primary authority over tariffs to Congress, not the president. “Recognizing the taxing power’s unique importance,” the Framers gave Congress alone “access to the pockets of the people.” And tariffs, of course, are “a tax levied on imported goods and services.”\n\nCongress has delegated some tariff authority to the executive branch, but those laws impose “strict limits” on the scope and duration of tariffs that the president may dictate. IEEPA’s grant of authority to “regulate” foreign imports, by contrast, contains none of these “procedural limitations.” So if it did permit tariffs, Roberts noted, it would leave the president “free to issue a dizzying array of modifications at will.” And “all it takes to unlock that extraordinary power is a presidential declaration of emergency, which the government asserts is unreviewable.” That is one clue that Congress did not intend IEEPA to encompass such freewheeling tariff authority.\n\nAnother clue: The government could not identify “any statute in which the power to regulate includes the power to tax.” In the entire U.S. Code, not a single law uses “regulation” to mean “taxation.” The court, Roberts wrote, was “therefore skeptical that in IEEPA—and IEEPA alone—Congress hid a delegation of its birth-right power to tax within the quotidian power to ‘regulate.’ ” Rather, “Congress’s pattern of usage” reveals that when it “grants the power to impose tariffs, it does so clearly and with careful constraints. It did neither here.” Combining these hints with “breadth, history, and constitutional context,” the chief found that IEEPA cannot plausibly be read to hand Trump the boundless freedom over tariffs that he claimed.\n\nThere was, however, a rift within the six-justice majority. Roberts, joined by Gorsuch and Barrett, invoked the “major questions doctrine” to bolster their conclusion that IEEPA does not cover tariffs. This controversial rule holds that the president must point to an explicit delegation of authority when addressing a matter of immense “economic and political significance.” The conservative supermajority has previously invoked the doctrine to strike down President Joe Biden’s student debt relief plan, climate regulations, and other progressive goals.\n\nTrump’s Justice Department argued that the doctrine does not apply to “foreign affairs,” attempting to gerrymander a massive exception to accommodate its trade policy. But Roberts, Gorsuch, and Barrett rejected this contention, particularly when those “affairs” implicate “the core congressional power of the purse.” The trio therefore applied the doctrine to confirm the court’s reading of IEEPA. Kagan, joined by Sotomayor and Jackson, wrote that there was no need to invoke “major questions” in this case. Rather, she wrote, “the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation amply support today’s result,” without any resort to rules that put “a thumb on the interpretive scales.” (In dueling concurrences, Gorsuch and Barrett also battled about the true meaning of the “major questions doctrine,” which confirms that the liberals were right to resist legitimizing this slippery, ill-defined rule here.)\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh’s principal dissent—joined by Justices Thomas and Alito—is an embarrassment that cannot be squared with much of his jurisprudence under Biden. After consistently reading statutes narrowly to hem in Biden’s authority, the justice interpreted IEEPA as expansively as possible, declaring that “tariffs are a traditional and common tool to regulate importation.” And after touting the major questions doctrine for his entire judicial career, he announced that it does not apply “in the foreign affairs context” (at least when Trump is in office). Thomas’ separate, lone dissent is even worse: The justice has long endorsed the “non-delegation doctrine,” which holds that Congress cannot delegate its core powers to the executive branch. Yet on Friday, he revised his view, writing that this doctrine does not apply to former “powers of the Crown.” Those powers, Thomas wrote, include tariffs, which are ostensibly not “within the core legislative power.” It is difficult to read this dissent as anything other than Thomas amending his views to accommodate Trump’s power-grabs.\n\nShould we be shocked that this court—which has, for 13 months, enabled Trump’s abuses of office over the shadow docket—smacked down Trump’s marquee economic policy so emphatically? Not really. For one thing, this case is pretty easy: As Roberts explained, no sensible reading of IEEPA would hand over unlimited tariff authority to the president. Moreover, the business community does not like these tariffs; even the Chamber of Commerce urged the justices to strike them down. The conservative justices are sympathetic toward corporate interests, and did them a favor by ending Trump’s whim-based tariff regime. These justices are also economically literate and must understand that tariffs are bad for the economy. As with Trump’s efforts to fire members of the Federal Reserve, this case gave the conservatives an opportunity to flaunt their independence while delivering a victory to corporate America. From that angle, it’s a pure win-win.\n\nBut we should not be entirely cynical about Friday’s ruling. It does take courage for the justices to stand up to the president this way, especially when he has tried to bully them into ruling in his favor. Since Trump returned to the White House, we have wondered whether the Supreme Court could muster enough independence to save our constitutional system from his efforts to consolidate all power in the Oval Office. Too often, SCOTUS has shirked this duty. But there are still some lines it won’t let Trump cross. As Roberts wrote, the Framers viewed taxation as “the one great power upon which the whole national fabric is based.” And in the end, he and his colleagues felt obliged to protect this thread of our national fabric from the man who would unravel it.",

    "description": "The court heard arguments last year on whether Trump exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) when imposing tariffs on goods from virtually every US trading partner.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court scrambled the US trade landscape Friday when it struck down the centerpiece of President Trump’s second-term tariff program, ruling 6-3 that his sweeping blanket tariffs are illegal.\n\nThe ruling came just over one year into Trump’s second term and after skeptical questioning from key justices during oral arguments last November and appears set to immediately halt a massive section of Trump’s tariffs. Those tariffs were first announced last year on “Liberation Day” using a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\n“IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,” read the decision, written by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nTrump attacked the high court in his first response Friday, particularly the justices in the majority, saying they were a \"disgrace to our nation.\" He hinted that the administration would pursue alternative methods toward implementing its trade goals.\n\nThe ruling also raised the question of refunds, which could return an estimated $129 billion to importers in the months ahead. It upholds two lower courts — including the US Court of International Trade — that previously found Trump did not have the authority to impose global tariffs using the 1977 law.\n\nThe decision will likely have wide-ranging ramifications, affecting global trade, consumers, companies, inflation and the pocketbooks of every American. In recent weeks, Trump has already made plans to roll back some tariffs on metals, including on steel and aluminum goods, as he and his administration seek to battle an affordability crisis ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nThe US Supreme Court changed the US trade agenda on Friday, ruling that blanket tariffs are illegal and striking down President Trump's most sweeping tariffs.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the court held that the 1977 International Emergency Powers ACT (IEEPA) does not give Trump the authority to impose taxes without approval from Congress.\n\nThis ruling will mean that much of the administration's current tariff agenda will be brought to a halt, especially those tariffs first announced in April last year, on what has come to be known as Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.\n\nToday, economists at Penn-Wharton said that over $175 billion in tariff revenue may need to be refunded if the Supreme Court rules against Trump's tariffs.\n\nHowever, according to SCOTUSblog, the court mentioned nothing about whether the government should go about returning the billions of dollars it made from importers.\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh, and Samuel Alito all dissented.\n\nJustice Kavanaugh, in his dissent, said, \"The United States may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court majority that struck down President Trump's ability to issue blanket tariffs on US trading partners did not address the issue of refunds — that is, will companies be able to get them for the duties they paid ... that are now ruled unconstitutional?\n\nThough the Supreme Court majority didn't address it, the dissenting minority did. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who authored the dissent, noted that the process could be a \"mess\" for the US Treasury to navigate.\n\nAfter the US Supreme Court struck down President Trump's tariffs, what are his options?\n\nTrump himself has said previously that the law he used to implement the tariffs is an essential tool in his toolbox. But other members of the administration have suggested that the White House could simply rebuild his tariff regime through other — albeit more cumbersome — methods.\n\nThe Associated Press has a good rundown of his options:\n\nThey run through them all here — read more.\n\nUS stocks rose in the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision to strike down President Trump's most sweeping tariffs. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led gains.\n\nSectors with more exposure to tariffs saw a bigger bounce. The Dow Jones Transportation Average (^DJT) popped around 1%. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) saw outsize gains, as did Stanley Black & Decker (SWK).\n\nHead over to our markets blog for full coverage of the stock market's reaction to the ruling.\n\nNovartis (NVS) CEO Vas Narasimhan met with President Trump at the White House on Wednesday, where the president said the company is set to build 11 plants in the US.\n\nTrump hit Switzerland with 39% tariffs last year, but then agreed to cut the duties to 15% in November. Last month, Novartis said it expected to be protected from tariffs under some agreements with the US and strong domestic manufacturing.\n\nThe Trump administration is pushing back on claims from the New York Federal Reserve that US consumers and businesses are bearing the brunt of higher costs due to President Trump's tariffs.\n\n\"The paper is an embarrassment,\" National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think it's the worst paper I've ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve System.\n\nHowever, data from the JPMorgan Chase Institute, released Thursday, also found that tariffs paid by midsize US businesses tripled in 2025.\n\nYahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports on the latest news on Trump's tariffs:\n\nJapan plans to invest up to $36 billion in US oil, gas, and critical mineral projects, part of Tokyo's $550 billion commitment under the trade agreement it struck with President Trump last year.\n\n“Our MASSIVE Trade Deal with Japan has just launched!” Trump posted on Tuesday on social media. “The scale of these projects are so large, and could not be done without one very special word, TARIFFS.”\n\nJapan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said that the projects will help build more resilient supply chains through partnerships in crucial areas for economic security.\n\nThe Supreme Court has added next Friday, Feb. 20, as a decision day, the first time in weeks it could potentially issue a verdict on the closely watched case involving President Trump's tariffs.\n\nNext Friday is listed as a non-argument session and conference day on the high court's calendar.\n\nThe high court heard arguments on the tariff case in November on an expedited basis, and both liberal- and conservative-leaning justices asked skeptical questions about Trump's authority to impose the tariffs.\n\nThe duties at issue are Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, in which the president slapped levies ranging from 10% to 50% on imports from virtually all US trading partners. The Trump administration has said a defeat at the Supreme Court would only prompt it to impose the duties via other legal means — though Trump himself has said those processes would be more cumbersome and has implored the court to uphold the tariffs.\n\nOn Wednesday night, President Trump pressured House Republicans to support his tariffs, even though rising living costs have upset many voters.\n\nWhile six Republicans voted against his current tariffs on Canadian goods, 210 others remained loyal to Trump. But experts say this could harm them in the upcoming midterm elections, as many voters remain concerned about rising prices.\n\nA report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York argues that Americans are paying for almost all of the additional costs from President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nPresident Trump's tariffs faced a rebuke on Wednesday as the US House of Representatives voted to pass a resolution seeking to terminate the national emergency measures Trump used to impose tariffs on Canada. Six Republicans voted with Democrats to scrap Trump's tariffs against the US's neighbor.\n\nYahoo Finance's Washington Correspondent Ben Werschkul outlines the outcome of yesterday's vote by the US House of Representatives and what it means for Trump's tariffs:\n\nThe US and Japan are nearing the completion of the first of three projects that Tokyo agreed to fund as part of its $550 billion investment in the US and tariff agreement.\n\nBloomberg reports that the three projects include a data center led by SoftBank Group Corp. (9984.T), a deep-sea oil terminal in the Gulf of Mexico, and semiconductors.\n\nAccording to the report, SoftBank didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nConfusion over the trade deal between the US and India emerged on Wednesday after the White House adjusted language around agricultural goods.\n\nIn the updated statement, the US has removed a reference to pulses, a staple food in India that includes lentils and chickpeas.\n\nIn the old version, the statement says that India will remove tariffs on \"certain pulses\", whereas in the new version, the word \"pulses\" has been removed. The old version also says India is \"committed to buying more American products,\" whereas the new statement says \"... intends to buy...\"\n\nThe countries appear to have made other changes to the statement, too.\n\nThe US House of Representatives will vote on Wednesday on whether to reject some of President Trump's tariffs. The vote comes months ahead of the midterm elections, at a time when many Americans are concerned about the rising cost of living.\n\nToday's vote will start with a resolution to stop Trump's tariffs on Canada, which currently include a 35% tariff on imported items such as steel, aluminum, and copper, as well as a 25% duty on non-US cars. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the free trade agreement Trump has threatened to scrap, does exempt some of these goods.\n\nThe House vote will proceed despite Speaker Mike Johnson's attempt to block it.\n\nTrump has there would be no extra cost to the American people. A report from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation has found that these tariffs will amount to an average tax increase per US household of $1,000 in 2025 and $1,300 in 2026.\n\nThe Financial Times reports that the Trump administration is planning to exempt hyperscalers Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT) from forthcoming chip tariffs as Big Tech races to build data centers to power artificial intelligence.\n\nMexico is trying to send fuel to Cuba to prevent a power collapse, but it is searching for a way to do this without being hit by tariffs from the US.\n\nWashington has threatened tariffs on any country that attempts to help Cuba by supplying fuel.\n\nCuba has been under a 60-year embargo from the US dating back to the 1960s.\n\nEstee Lauder (EL) shares slumped 10% before the bell on Thursday, despite beating analysts' estimates on earnings per share and revenue, but tariff woes caused the beauty group's shares to tumble.\n\nThe Trump administration will be launching a $12 billion \"emergency warehouse\" for critical minerals needed to build cars, phones, and jets. The plan will include buying and storing these minerals now. The US hopes this will reduce its and other countries' reliance on China for supplies.\n\nThe critical mineral's stockpile news was released on Monday, and Vice President JD Vance plans to deliver a keynote speech on Wednesday at a meeting with the Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials from Europe, Asia, and Africa.\n\nThe Trump administration said on Tuesday that it plans to reduce India's tariffs on American industrial goods to zero from 13.5%, but will allow India to protect its farmers from foreign competition.\n\nThe US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer made the statement a day after President Trump agreed to reduce tariffs on New Delhi, claiming India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop purchasing Russian Oil.\n\nTrump hit India with 50% tariffs last year, 25% of which was a penalty for purchasing Russian oil, which Trump claimed was helping to fund the war in Ukraine.\n\nPresident Trump announced Monday that the \"reciprocal\" tariff rate on goods from India would drop to 18% from 25%, but that announcement underplayed the extent of the tariff reduction in evidence Monday in what the president described as a trade deal between the two nations.\n\nA White House official confirmed that, in addition to the reduction Trump outlined, the White House is also planning to drop a separate tariff of 25% on Indian goods over its Russian oil purchases, which previously amounted to a 50% tariff on Indian goods.\n\nThe new total tariff rate of 18% was what Prime Minister Narendra Modi quickly touted in his own social media post after the call with Trump, offering “Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India” but not outlining any of the changes on his end, which Trump listed.\n\nTrump said Monday that India had agreed to stop buying Russian oil and also reduce their tariffs and non-tariff barriers against the United States \"to ZERO.\"\n\nPresident Trump on Monday said the US and India had agreed to a trade deal after he spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nTrump said the baseline US tariff rate on goods from India would drop to 18% from 25%. The US president also claimed that Modi had \"agreed to stop buying Russian Oil.\" India is also currently facing an additional 25% \"secondary\" tariff on its purchases of Russian oil.\n\n\"Our amazing relationship with India will be even stronger going forward,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nModi also agreed to buy American products \"at a much higher level,\" Trump said.\n\nThe apparent US deal with India comes as US trade partners are clinching long-negotiated deals in a rebuke to the Trump tariff regime. India and the EU announced a trade deal last week that the EU dubbed the \"mother of all deals,\" which came after years of negotiations between the two sides.\n\nPresident Trump is planning to launch a $12 billion minerals stockpile, according to Bloomberg News, in a bid to counter the US's reliance on China for rare earth materials.\n\nThe initiative has been dubbed Project Vault and will combine $1.67 billion in private capital with a $10 billion loan from the US Export-Import Bank. It is hoped that this venture will help acquire and store minerals for automakers, tech companies and other manufacturers.\n\nRare earth materials are key components used in a variety of products, such as smartphones, cars and rechargeable batteries. China has the largest reserve of rare earths and last year restricted exports of the materials due to Trump's tariffs. In November, China lifted the restrictions as part of a one-year trade truce with the US.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that her country will look for alternate ways to help Cuba, including \"diplomatic\" solutions after President Trump signed an order to levy tariffs on countries that supply Cuba with oil, Reuters reported. Mexico is one of the last nations that supplies Cuba with oil.\n\nThe US trade deficit — the value of imports minus the value of exports — swung wider in November as trade continued to shift in response to the Trump administration's tariff policies.\n\nPresident Trump's global tariffs have failed to stop Toyota Motors (TM), the Japanese car company said on Thursday that it had sold a record 11.3 million vehicles globally in 2025.\n\nToyota Motors will retain its position as the world's top-selling automaker in 2025, and its recent sales growth has come despite Trump's aggressive tariff policies.\n\nTrump initially imposed 25% tariffs on Japanese automakers but reduced them to 15% after reaching a deal with Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.\n\nThe stock rose 2% during early trading on Thursday.",

    "description": "A pioneering energy-generating device utilizes reliable wind speeds at an altitude of 6,500 feet (2,000 meters).",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nA Chinese energy firm has successfully tested an experimental blimp-like wind turbine capable of generating energy in the skies above cities and inland communities.\n\nDeveloped by Beijing Linyi Yunchuan Energy Technology, the S2000 airborne wind energy system (AWES) is a large, helium-filled airship containing 12 wind turbines.\n\nThe craft ascends thousands of feet into the air to harness the stable wind speeds at higher altitudes, which spin the turbines and generate electricity. This is then sent down the tethering cable to the ground below, where it can enter the grid.\n\nIn its test flight, the manufacturers flew the S2000 at an altitude of 6,560 feet (2,000 meters) above Sichuan Province, generating 385 kilowatt-hours of electricity.\n\nThis is enough to power the average U.S. household for approximately 13.3 days, per usage figures provided by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nIn total, the S2000 clocks in at 197 feet (60 m) long, 131 feet (40 m) high and 131 feet (40 m) wide, as reported by Global Times. The system is rated at 3 megawatts total power capacity.\n\nThe new technology has a couple of potential uses, the developers suggest. \"One is for off-grid settings like border outposts, where it can serve as a relatively stable conventional energy source,” explained Weng Hanke, CTO at Linyi Yunchuan Energy Technology, as reported by Tide News — an affiliate of the state-owned Zhejiang Daily Press Group — via Global Times.\n\n\"The other is to complement traditional ground-based wind power systems, creating a three-dimensional approach to energy supply.\"\n\nIf realized at scale, the approach could have transformational potential for countries with constrained space for onshore wind generation, such as many in mainland Europe, as well as those without the shallow seabeds necessary for offshore wind power generation, such as Japan.\n\nHowever, the reliability of the tethered cable for delivering stable power to the grid will require further testing.\n\nIn all but the most remote rural communities, the 1.25-mile (2,000 m) cable could present a dangerous obstacle to aircraft. In the U.K., the Civil Aviation Authority requires those wishing to fly tethered balloons above 200 feet (60 m) to apply for special permission to avoid risk to aircraft sharing airspace with the balloon.\n\nBeyond its safety concerns, the S2000 will also need to undergo rigorous testing to ensure its viability for reliable commercial operations. Standard wind turbines require regular maintenance and the craft could prove difficult and more costly to service as it will have to return to the ground for every repair.\n\nWind turbines can generate more power where the wind power density — the measure of wind energy that can be harnessed at a given altitude — is higher. Offshore wind turbines, for example, can capture the higher, more consistent wind speeds over open water.\n\nThese offshore turbines can also be significantly larger than their onshore counterparts, with the hub of Chinese manufacturer Dongfang Electric’s DEW-26 MW-310 offshore turbine standing at 606.9 feet (185 m). Floating wind turbines can be similarly gigantic, with the tower for the recently-revealed, record breaking floating wind turbine from China Huaneng Group reaching 489 feet (152 m).\n\nFor example, the average offshore wind speed deemed suitable for wind farms at 295 feet (90 m) elevation within U.S. waters is 7 meters per second, per the Marine Cadastre National Viewer, a web-based data viewer produced by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office for Coastal Management.\n\n—China builds record-breaking floating wind turbine — it could change the face of renewable energy\n\n—Chinese scientists have found a way to make batteries more efficient — by using water\n\nIt’s hard to state the exact wind speed at various altitudes, as this varies by location and weather.\n\nThe aerospace group Omnidea estimates that at altitudes between 328 and 8,200 feet (100 and 2,500 m), wind power density increases by approximately a factor of six, with an average wind speed of 33.5 mph (15 m/s) at 8,200 feet\n\nThis highlights the potential efficiencies to be unlocked with greater exploitation of higher-altitude wind speeds with tethered, flying wind turbines such as the S2000.",

    "fullText": "The post Stunning Drone Footage Captures the Moment a Massive Whale Approaches an Unsuspecting Paddleboarder appeared first on A-Z Animals.\n\nA Southern Right Whale was filmed approaching and making gentle contact with a paddleboarder off the coast of Argentina.\n\nSouthern Right Whales are slow-moving baleen whales that migrate between Antarctic feeding grounds and warmer coastal breeding areas in South America, Africa, and Australia.\n\nAlthough these whales can be curious and surface-active, wildlife experts recommend maintaining a safe distance because they are powerful wild animals protected by law in many regions.\n\nWhen paddleboarding in the ocean, you never know what kind of animals you’ll encounter. But we’re guessing that getting a little push from a Southern right whale is likely not something you expect. This paddleboarder was treated to a boost from the gentle whale, who swam right up to their board.\n\nSet to music, the video shows the whale as he approaches the paddleboarder. Swimming smoothly through the water, the whale goes right behind the board and appears to make gentle contact from behind. He continues to linger just underneath the board. We can only imagine how excited the paddleboarder was to see the whale up close and personal. Wisely, they stayed calm and let the encounter unfold.\n\nThe whale breaks the surface a couple of times before it is joined by another whale. The two animals stay mostly below the surface, breaking through periodically. We’re not sure how much the paddleboarder was able to see from their position, but the drone captured the most amazing display from above.\n\nThis drone footage was captured off the coast of Argentina. Southern right whales are a type of baleen whale, which means that they use plates in their mouths to filter small organisms out of the water for food. They do not have teeth. Historically, right whales have been hunted for their blubber and meat.\n\nThey live in warmer waters during mating season and are often spotted near South America, Africa, and Australia. During other times, they stay close to the far south near Antarctica. Southern right whales are known for their surface activity and occasional curiosity around boats. They also like to stay close to the surface and will breach, blow, roll, and engage in plenty of other acrobatics for various purposes.\n\nRight whales are slow swimmers, which you can clearly see in this video footage. This isn’t the first time that a whale has interacted with paddleboarders. Whales get close to boats, boards, and kayaks a surprising amount in the wild. It’s important to keep your distance from whales and other wild animals, however. Some species can get aggressive, although right whales tend to be pretty docile and calm. Still, wild animals are best left alone. If one takes an interest in you, such as in this video, the best thing to do is try to capture the amazing encounter on video for the rest of us to enjoy.\n\nWhales are very social and naturally extremely curious animals. Although whales were heavily hunted in the past, in some regions with regulated wildlife tourism, they may tolerate close boat presence. This behavior doesn’t only appear with the right whales but has been witnessed with blue whales, gray whales, and killer whales as well.\n\nThere have been instances where whales have approached swimmers, kayakers, or paddleboarders. Large whales rarely show aggression toward humans, but they are powerful wild animals and can unintentionally cause injury. And while it may not be typical to see them giving you a push while you relax on your paddleboard, these interactions are also not unheard of.\n\nThe post Stunning Drone Footage Captures the Moment a Massive Whale Approaches an Unsuspecting Paddleboarder appeared first on A-Z Animals.",

    "fullText": "The last time Ireland visited Allianz Stadium, in 2024, they had just equalled England's Six Nations record of 11 straight wins and were chasing the rarefied air of back-to-back Grand Slams.\n\nSince that 23-22 defeat, however, Ireland have lost six times in 20 Tests. All six of those losses have come against the other three nations - South Africa, New Zealand and France - currently ranked higher than Andy Farrell's side.\n\nIn the 12 months since beating England in last year's Six Nations, Ireland have lost to France (twice), the All Blacks and the Springboks by a combined 61 points.\n\nTheir miserable return to Paris a fortnight ago ended with their heaviest Six Nations loss in 16 years, giving fuel to the 'Ireland in decline' debate.\n\nIndeed, a succession of humbling in-ring experiences with the game's heavyweights have intensified the scrutiny on a team who have slipped to fifth in the world rankings after entering the 2023 World Cup as number one.\n\nWhether it's been age profile, a creaking scrum, a sputtering attack, the unsettled fly-half situation or a British and Irish Lions hangover, most of the discussion has been largely negative.\n\nBut from an Irish perspective, there is no better way to flip the narrative than a big win over the English, who are wounded from last week's Calcutta Cup defeat by Scotland.\n\nOf course, having left Stade de France empty-handed before failing to secure a bonus point in the win over Italy, Ireland know another loss would dash their title hopes for another year.\n\n\"I think the lads are going to be a bit annoyed at the negative chat that's surrounding the team for the past while,\" legendary Ireland scrum-half Conor Murray said on the Ireland Rugby Social.\n\n\"There's so many quality, world-class players and leaders in that team. I hope they just go there and say 'let's go for it here, lads, we're sick of people talking about us in a negative light, look at the quality we have in the room.\"\n\nFive moments that made England centurion Itoje\n\nLions tour 'no excuse' for loss of form - Furlong\n\nUnderdog status should be irrelevant - Farrell\n\nDespite England's latest painful visit to Murrayfield, however, the odds are stacked against Ireland, who have won four of the past five Six Nations meetings.\n\nHaving handed a debut to powerful Munster lock Edwin Edogbo last week, Farrell has packed his team with experience, recalling British and Irish Lions Jamison Gibson-Park, Tadhg Beirne, Tadhg Furlong and Josh van der Flier.\n\nIn his headline selection call, Farrell handed the 10 jersey back to Jack Crowley, with Sam Prendergast left at home this weekend.\n\nIn a more surprising move, Farrell opted not to match England head coach Steve Borthwick's six-two split on the bench, instead picking three backs - Craig Casey, Ciaran Frawley and Tommy O'Brien - in the hope that they can stretch England in the second half.\n\nIt will be a huge afternoon for Crowley in just his second Six Nations start since he helped steer Ireland to the title in 2024 in the wake of Johnny Sexton's retirement.\n\n\"The 10 has a big part in leading the attack during the week and Jack has been great at that this week,\" said Ireland captain Caelan Doris.\n\n\"He's an exciting attacking runner. He was very good last week when he came on and brought another level to our attack. I'm excited to see him with ball in hand and making things happen.\"\n\nAfter a sluggish, passive start that led to a 22-0 half-time deficit against France, Crowley is charged with orchestrating a vintage Irish attacking display away from home.\n\nCrowley injected much-needed tempo to the attack in last week's win over Italy and helped tee up Rob Baloucoune's decisive score, which Farrell later said was \"as good a try\" as his side have ever scored.\n\nIreland will have been encouraged by the example set in Murrayfield last week as Scotland roared into a 17-0 lead in the opening 20 minutes.\n\n\"A fast start is going to be important, especially away from home,\" said Doris when asked about Ireland's key focus in the build-up.\n\n\"Trying to get scoreboard pressure and get our fans into it but also take that away from England.\n\n\"[We'll also need] some set-piece dominance as well. England thrive when they're dominant in that area. They're obviously quite pragmatic and don't want to play too many phases in their own half so it's about getting the balance right.\"\n\nBut England have won their past nine home games - South Africa in 2024 were the last side to leave southwest London with a win - and are hoping a first start for livewire back row Henry Pollock will help them extend that sequence.\n\nThe 21-year-old announced himself to a large portion of the Ireland squad with a try-scoring display in Northampton's Champions Cup semi-final win over Leinster last year, just days before Farrell included him in his Lions squad.\n\nSaturday will be the first time Farrell has coached against the Lions he guided to a 2-1 series win over Australia last summer, with Pollock one of nine in Borthwick's starting XV.\n\n\"Cutting out time and space,\" said Doris when asked how Ireland plan to keep Pollock quiet.\n\n\"He's got the ability to make something happen from not a whole lot.\n\n\"We need to pressure him as a back row, they've got a lot of breakdown threats but the ability to make something happen with ball in hand so it'll be a good battle there.\"\n\nSaturday 21 February at 14:10 GMT\n\nEngland: Steward; Freeman, Lawrence, Dingwall, Arundell; Ford, Mitchell; Genge, Cowan-Dickie, Heyes, Itoje (capt), Chessum, T Curry, Earl, Pollock.\n\nReplacements: George, Rodd, Davison, Coles, Pepper, Underhill, Van Poortvliet, M Smith.\n\nIreland: Osborne; Baloucoune, Ringrose, McCloskey, Lowe; Crowley, Gibson-Park; Loughman, Sheehan, Furlong, Ryan, McCarthy, Beirne, Van der Flier, Doris (capt).\n\nReplacements: Kelleher, O'Toole, Bealham, Conan, Timoney, Casey, Frawley, O'Brien.",

The work is definitely there.\"\n\nAustralia's poor World Cup follows their 4-1 victory over England in the Ashes. They have not lost an Ashes series since 2015.

Wasim Ali's 32 was the highest score for Oman, who depart the tournament with four defeats from four.\n\nCaptain Marsh, seemingly keen to hit through any frustrations at his side's run, then crashed seven fours and four sixes, including two huge hits over the leg side, to wrap up victory in quick time.\n\nOnly 12 runs were needed when left-arm spinner Shakeel Ahmed dismissed Travis Head for 32. Marsh finished unbeaten on 64 from 33.\n\nAustralia's victory concludes the group stage of the World Cup - this was one of few mismatches between the lower and higher-ranked sides.\n\nThe Super 8s begin on Saturday with a meeting between New Zealand and Pakistan in Colombo.

Almost everyone is anxiously staring at the TVs, willing those same four men to reach a Winter Olympic final.\n\nChances are they will be doing the same on Saturday (18:05 GMT), when Team GB's Bruce Mouat, Grant Hardie, Hammy McMillan and Bobby Lammie take on Canada with a gold medal at stake.\n\n\"Our gold medal,\" as Mouat referred to it after the epic semi-final win over Switzerland in northern Italy on Thursday - a contest which drew 3.4million viewers to the BBC at its peak.\n\nAnd fulfilling what they believe to be their destiny - by upgrading their silver medal from Beijing four years ago - is what these four Scots have travelled to Cortina to do.\n\nSince that 2022 near miss, Team Mouat have come to dominate men's curling, winning two World Championships and adding another couple of European crowns, as well as a record 12 Grand Slam titles.\n\nAt times, they have been unbeatable.\n\nThat cloak of invincibility slipped during the round-robin stages here - leaving qualification out of their hands - but that fright has now been forgotten, replaced with the return of a clear-eyed focus on the task in hand.\n\nBut who are these four young men who have now caught the country's attention? And what makes them more than the sum of their parts?\n\nGB men into Olympic curling final as women squeezed out\n\nWhat do curlers do when they're not at the Olympics?\n\nHow Team GB is leading the way in curling's arms race\n\nTo understand the dynamic between the quartet, you have to go back almost nine years to when they first came together as a team.\n\nWith the world of curling being as small as it is, they weren't strangers to each other. Hardie and McMillan are 33-year-old cousins from south-west Scotland. Lammie, 29, hails from there, too, and played in a rink previously with 31-year-old Mouat, who knew the others from their shared school days in Edinburgh.\n\nApproaches were made, conversations had, culminating in a meeting.\n\n\"That first time we met, the thing we wrote at the top of our list of goals was to win Olympic gold,\" Mouat told BBC Sport.\n\nAfter that, the die was cast. The boys told British Curling they were only willing to join the elite programme as a unit and not individually. Their ultimatum was accepted, success has followed, and now they are considered the best in the world.\n\nMouat is thought to be among the greatest skips to have played the game. Hardie has a reputation as a high-grade tactician and shot maker, while McMillan and Lammie are credited with reinventing the role of a sweeper.\n\nOnce just 'the lads with the brushes', their physicality has evolved the position to the extent that the curling cognoscenti consider it to now be \"a sweeping game\" rather than a throwing one.\n\nBut it is the coalescence of their personalities that amplifies all that sporting talent. And underpinning the team are two key things - total honesty and trust.\n\nMcMillan says if one of them is being an idiot \"the rest can say so\", while the more-measured Mouat describes it as \"knowing the different things to say to get the best out of each other\".\n\nIndividually, they are all very different.\n\nMcMillan is lively enough for all four of them; Hardie is the logic guy, an engineer by trade; Mouat is thoughtful, reflective and calm - while Lammie is the quiet, reliable presence in the background.\n\nIt might be labelled as 'Team Mouat' - as per the convention of naming a rink after the skip - but this is very much a collective. In fact, Mouat is keen to share the spotlight.\n\n\"Bruce is so compassionate and calm and he's very different from a lot of skips,\" explains BBC Sport pundit and 2022 gold medallist Vicky Wright.\n\n\"A lot of them are clearly the leader but the GB team operates so well because they function on a level playing field.\n\n\"The dynamic they've got works so well because they all bring a different aspect to the table and they all respect that. That's a massive part of why they're so successful.\"\n\nIt's instructive to see how comfortable the four of them are in each other's company and with the position they find themselves in.\n\nAll four - and alternate Kyle Waddell - have been right in among it in Cortina this week, be it stopping for a chat in the street or in restaurants, meeting friends and relatives, watching other British athletes compete. Or - in Mouat's case - going pillowcase shopping and \"spending far too much money\" on the morning of the semi-final.\n\nEven in the moments before that crucial match, there was a relaxed focus about them. McMillan and Hardie were sharing a laugh, Mouat picking out familiar faces in the crowd for a smile and a wave, and Lammie was casually studying the Swiss warming up.\n\nAll of that will culminate on Saturday night in the quirky Cortina Curling Stadium, first built as an open-air venue to host the 1956 Games.\n\nIn a place where history looks down from the wooden bleachers, these four will attempt to make their own by becoming the first GB men's rink in 102 years to win Olympic gold.\n\nAchieve that, and maybe the next time they go into that Glasgow pub they might just draw a few glances of recognition.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Cameron Menzies says he was close to \"wrapping\" up his darts career as the hand injury he suffered punching a drinks table at the PDC World Championship has left him with \"no feeling\" in the fingers of his right hand.\n\nThe Scot repeatedly struck the underside of the table following a first-round defeat against Charlie Manby at Alexandra Palace in December with blood then pouring from the wound.\n\nSpeaking after winning his opening match at the Poland Darts Open on Friday against Ritchie Edhouse, Menzies described \"struggling massively\" in recent weeks.\n\n\"Basically, I've no feeling in my fingers anymore because of the damage I've done,\" he told Oche 180.\n\n\"I'll be honest - there's a few times I've felt like wrapping it.\n\n\"I'm just not in a good place.

Honestly, I was so close to pulling out this weekend. I'm just not enjoying it at the moment.\"\n\nThe 36-year-old added that surgeons have told him he was fortunate not to have severed any nerves or tendons but that he should gradually recover following further treatment.\n\n\"I couldn't feel my fingers for six weeks. I had to go through surgery. I've still to go through hand treatment and trauma,\" he said.\n\n\"I've made a massive mistake in my life. You can see the scar.\n\n\"They said [the feeling] will come back, but I have to live with the reputation of being a table puncher. It's not a proud moment of my life.\n\n\"We all make mistakes.

    "fullText": "Jose Mourinho made a \"huge mistake\" with his \"unacceptable\" post-match comments after the alleged racial abuse of Real Madrid winger Vinicius Jr, says Bayern Munich boss Vincent Kompany.\n\nThe Brazil forward scored the only goal in Real Madrid's 1-0 Champions League win against Benfica on Tuesday.\n\nVinicius was booked for his goal celebration and the match was halted for 10 minutes shortly afterwards when the player reported alleged racist abuse from Benfica winger Gianluca Prestianni.\n\nUefa has since opened an investigation into the claims, which Prestianni denies.\n\nSpeaking after the match, Benfica boss Mourinho - who was sent off late in the game for arguing with the referee - said Vinicius had been \"disrespectful\" with his goal celebration and pointed to the club's legendary striker Eusebio as proof that Benfica is not a racist club.\n\nOn Friday, Kompany spoke passionately and emotionally for more than 10 minutes when asked about Mourinho's comments at his pre-match news conference before Bayern's game with Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday.\n\n\"After the game you have leader of an organisation, Jose Mourinho, who basically attacks the character of Vinicius Jr by bringing in the type of celebration to discredit what Vinicius is doing in this moment,\" said Kompany, who answered in English \"so I can be a bit clearer about what I'm saying\".\n\n\"For me, in terms of leadership, it's a huge mistake and it's something that we should not accept.\"\n\nKompany was also critical of Mourinho for using Eusebio's name as supposed proof that Benfica is not a racist club.\n\n\"Do you know what black players had to go through in the 1960s?\" added the former Manchester City captain and Burnley boss.\n\n\"Was he (Mourinho) there to travel with Eusebio to every away game?\n\n\"Probably at the time the only option they had was to be quiet, to say nothing, be above it and to be 10 times better in order to get a little bit of credit for people to say 'actually, he is good'.\n\nMourinho has not directly addressed the criticism and spoke only to Benfica club media on Friday reflecting on the game and the aftermath.\n\n\"The game was truly demanding in every aspect,\" he said. \"Up until the 50th minute, it was a great game, extremely demanding, both physically and tactically.\n\n\"But then, I also have to acknowledge, that from the 51st minute until now - and this won't end our conversation - it hasn't been easy to manage emotionally everything that has happened and continues to happen.\"\n\nKompany, who also spoke about racial abuse he experienced as a player, said talk of Vinicius' celebration should not distract from the player's immediate response to Prestianni's alleged remarks.\n\n\"I'm just thinking when Jose Mourinho is doing the knee slide at Old Trafford, when he does his celebration in front of the [Barcelona] fans in the Champions League semi-final with Inter Milan, when his Roma are playing Sevilla and he is fighting with the referee and the referee has to leave the country under protection,\" he added.\n\n\"I know 100 people who have worked with Jose Mourinho. I've never heard a person say anything bad about Jose.\n\n\"I understand he is fighting for his team and his club. You cannot be a bad person and have all the ex players you have had talk so positively about you.\n\n\"I don't need to judge him as a person but I know what I've heard. And I understand maybe what he has done, but he has made a mistake.\"\n\nMeanwhile, former South Africa striker Benni McCarthy felt Mourinho should acknowledge he made a mistake with his \"very wrong\" comments.\n\n\"The situation, he could have handled it better or chosen his words better but emotions got the better of him,\" McCarthy told BBC World Service presenter Isaac Fanin.\n\n\"I know the statement he made was very wrong. But we're all human, we all make mistakes.\n\n\"When it comes from somebody I know personally and I know how he feels about our continent and our people and the players that play for him, he's the most stand-up guy that any African player will ever play for.\n\n\"I think it was an emotional decision, tough, where he maybe made a call and it wasn't the right call which he will later, hopefully come out and say that he made a mistake because that's what I would like to think, that's the kind of man he is.\"\n\nVinicius, who has been a victim of numerous incidents of racist abuse during his playing career, later said in a post on Instagram: \"Racists are, above all, cowards.\"\n\nBenfica have defended Prestianni and claim there is a \"defamation campaign\" against the Argentine.\n\nThe 20-year-old, who could face a minimum 10-match ban from European competition if found guilty, has denied directing racial abuse at Vinicius.\n\nVinicius: Eight years at Real Madrid, 20 cases of alleged racist abuse\n\nReal Madrid tie halted over Vinicius racism allegation\n\n'Anyone found guilty of racism should not be in the game'\n\nChampions League scores & fixtures\n\nFollow the latest Champions League news\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone\n\nWatch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nThere will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.",

    "fullText": "Mikel Arteta says Arsenal are \"exactly where we want to be\" in every competition despite criticism after the disappointing Premier League draw against bottom club Wolves.\n\nThe league leaders conceded a stoppage-time equaliser at Molineux on Wednesday to open the door for rivals Manchester City in the title race.\n\nThe Gunners are still in control of their own destiny as they chase a first title since 2004, with a five-point gap over Pep Guardiola's side.\n\nIf Arsenal win all of their games from now until the end of the season they will be crowned champions - but the same can be said of City, who host the Gunners at Etihad Stadium in April.\n\nArteta's side have finished second in the league for three successive seasons and the result in midweek has led to some suggestions they are 'bottling' their current title bid.\n\nGiven Arsenal are currently top of the league, in the Carabao Cup final, in the FA Cup fifth round and progressed with a 100% record in the Champions League, Arteta was asked if those outside the club need some perspective.\n\n\"No, because I think everybody has their own opinion, and their perspective is the right one,\" Arteta said.\n\n\"We have ourselves a very clear instruction. We have to live the present. What we did in the past is great, but we have to live the present, and the present is beautiful.\n\n\"We are exactly where we want to be in every competition but there is still lots to play, and we need to earn it like we have done in the last seven or eight months.\"\n\n'Bottle word will be used' as Arsenal blow title advantage\n\nPressure mounts as Arsenal blow two-goal lead to draw at Wolves\n\nArsenal's lead could be just two points by the time they kick off the north London derby at Tottenham on Sunday, if Manchester City beat Newcastle on Saturday.\n\nArteta says his side will be looking to channel both the disappointment against Wolves and the emotion of their rivalry with Spurs at the weekend.\n\n\"That's what we are trying to do. The instant reaction, first of all, is pain, and after that is 'OK, what can I do about it?' And that's it,\" Arteta said.\n\n\"There is no other thing that we have to do. Now what we have to do is perform on the pitch. The words are clear.\"\n\nAfter Arsenal's draw at Molineux, Wolves' TikTok account posted a video mocking the way the game played out for the Gunners, highlighting various instances of perceived time wasting.\n\nWhen Arteta was asked by BBC Sport about the clip in Friday's news conference, he said he would prefer to listen to the opinion of Wolves manager Rob Edwards.\n\n\"No, what I read is the press conference of Rob, the manager, before the game and what he said about us and why he texted me. He thinks that we are the best team in the league by far,\" Arteta said.\n\n\"I'm much more interested about that than any other thing that I don't know who posts or whatever, especially because I don't read it.\"\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Team GB's Gus Kenworthy says he is \"on the right side\" after he received death threats for posting a graphic message about the United States' Immigration and Customs Enforcement organisation.\n\nFreestyle skier Kenworthy shared the image - in which 'ICE' was preceded by an expletive - on Instagram a week before he was due to compete at the Winter Olympics in Italy.\n\nIn January, intensive care nurse Alex Pretti, 37, and fellow Minnesota resident Renee Good, 37, were both killed by ICE agents in the city, sparking protests across the US.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Sport about the threats he received, Kenworthy said: \"It was tough. No-one wants to read bad things about themselves, things that are threats and violent and scary and homophobic.\n\n\"I also took it with a grain of salt. I couldn't imagine writing something like that about someone, especially on a public forum, anyone who does that has something wrong with them.\n\n\"I think I'm on the right side.\"\n\nKenworthy, 34, was born in Chelmsford but grew up in the US and won silver in the ski slopestyle at the Sochi 2014 Games, before switching allegiance to Team GB in 2019.\n\nHe qualified in ninth place for tonight's halfpipe final, which starts at 18:30 GMT, with a score of 81.25 points.\n\nUS skier Hunter Hess qualified in fifth and made an 'L' sign against his forehead after completing his first run, in response to US President Donald Trump calling him \"a real loser\".\n\nBefore the Games, Hess had said: \"Just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the US.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters after Friday's qualifiers, he said: \"I worked so hard to be here. I sacrificed my entire life to make this moment happen.\n\n\"I'm not going to let controversy like that get in my way. I love the United States of America. I cannot say that enough.\"\n\nPresident Trump's border tsar said earlier in February that the immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota will end.\n\nTom Homan said Operation Metro Surge had resulted in many illegal immigrants who had committed violent crimes being detained for deportation. But the surge also sparked nationwide protests when US citizens Good and Pretti were killed by immigration officers.\n\nMore than 4,000 undocumented immigrants had been arrested, according to Homan, who added that ICE has always had a presence in Minnesota and will continue to have one.\n\nGB's Kenworthy receives death threats for anti-ICE post\n\nKenworthy retired after the 2022 Olympics in Beijing but announced his comeback last year.\n\nHowever, he has had to self-fund his way to the Games given GB Snowsport's athlete funding had already been allocated.\n\n\"I called it quits partly because I'd been doing it a long time and I had burnout and was over it, but I was also having some bad head injuries and so it made it easier to walk away,\" said the five-time World Championship medallist.\n\n\"Months after, when those symptoms started to subside and I started to feel myself again, I started wondering it wasn't the way I wanted it to finish.\n\n\"I kept pushing that feeling away, and finally I was at a point where I was like 'ok, well if you're having that feeling, it's now or never, and I didn't want to live to regret it and wonder what if.\n\n\"I decided to just give it a push and make it go, and try and get there. It's been pretty tough, because I didn't have any funding, I wasn't on any national team in order to get assistance, so it's been totally self-funded, myself, my coach, both of our travel, training camps, lift tickets, insurance, all of it, food, lodgings.\n\n\"I struggled deciding if it was the right thing to do, but ultimately, money comes and goes, this opportunity won't.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "A group of close friends and experienced skiers had long planned a backcountry trip in the rugged Sierra Nevada mountains, but their trek ended in tragedy as a football-field-sized crush of snow and ice overtook their tour.\n\nA skier cried “avalanche!” in the remote stretch of the mountains, but the group was soon overcome by the deluge Tuesday, the sheriff said.\n\nSix of those friends, mothers and wives, are now counted among nine killed or presumed dead in the avalanche near California’s Lake Tahoe - the deadliest avalanche the US has seen in 45 years.\n\nAn investigation into the incident is underway, including into whether criminal negligence played a role, according to the Nevada County Sheriff’s Office, and California’s workplace safety agency has launched a probe into the tour company that organized the trip, Blackbird Mountain Guides, CNN affiliate KXTV reported.\n\nBlackbird has said all of the guides with the group are highly trained, including being certified instructors with the American Institute for Avalanche Research and Education.\n\nThe group of 15, including four guides, had embarked on the three-day backcountry expedition over Presidents’ Day weekend and was on its final day, heading back to the trailhead, when the tragedy struck.\n\nSix survivors were rescued, but the effort to recover bodies has since been hindered by days of heavy snow and risky conditions with extreme cold temperatures expected in the next 24 hours.\n\nThe members of the tight-knit friend group who died were identified in a statement by their families as Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt.\n\nThe women were “connected through the love of the outdoors,” and “passionate, skilled skiers who cherished time together in the mountains,” their families said in a statement. “They were experienced backcountry skiers who deeply respected the mountains.”\n\nThe trip had been organized “well in advance” and they had trained and prepared for the rough travel, trusted their professional guides, and were fully equipped with avalanche safety equipment, according to the statement.\n\nBut the conditions that day proved to be severe. While two members of the friend group and four others on the trip were rescued from the aftermath Tuesday, the family members of nine others, including three guides, received devastating news. The bodies of eight had been left on the icy mountainside, and one other was still missing, presumed dead among the blanket of snow.\n\n“We have many unanswered questions,” the families’ statement said. “We are heartbroken and are doing our best to care for one another and our families in the way we know these women would have wanted.”\n\nSekar and Clabaugh were sisters, their brother told The New York Times, who said he was wounded to have lost both of them.\n\n“These are two of the best people I’ve ever known,” McAlister Clabaugh told the newspaper. “They were incredible sisters, mothers, wives and friends. And the idea that they are both gone is, I don’t even know how to put it into words.”\n\nThe six friends lived in the Bay Area, Idaho, and the Truckee–Tahoe region, the statement said.\n\nSekar’s neighbor described her as “a wonderful human being who loved life,” KXTV reported. She was “a very vibrant person, one of the nicest people I’ve ever known.”\n\nVitt “seemed like a super friendly, great mom,” one of her neighbors, Carleen Cullen, told KXTV. “She was just always out there with her kids and getting them hustled off to school and after-school activities.”\n\n“Our hearts go out to those that lost their lives and a community of skiers, a community of families from the Bay Area,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday, noting his wife had a connection to some of the victims.\n\n“Turns out (we have) a lot of mutual friends in Marin County. Just learning some of my wife’s old family friends,” he told reporters at an event in the Bay Area.\n\n“I’ve been in that area many, many times. Stayed in those cabins just a year or so ago, and very mindful of the terrain and the nature of this,” Newsom added, referring to huts the group stayed in during the trip.\n\nThe deadliest avalanche in California’s recorded history has drawn rescue and recovery resources from as far as Los Angeles — about 500 miles away.\n\nIncident response teams have been waiting for a break in the storm when they may safely trek back to the rough terrain, which officials described as “vertical in nature,” to bring home the bodies.\n\n“Due to hazardous weather conditions, avalanche victims cannot be safely extracted off the mountain today. Recovery efforts are expected to carry into the weekend,” the Nevada County Sheriff’s Office said in an update on Thursday.\n\nCrews faced the ongoing threat of additional avalanches on Thursday with over a foot of snow in the area. Sustained winds reaching up to 20 mph, punctuated with even stronger gusts, limited visibility, hampering teams’ ability to navigate the mountainside.\n\nThe battering snow subsided Thursday night, offering rescuers a reprieve on Friday and into the weekend. The main concern for the next 24 hours is extreme cold, with temperatures expected to reach the teens in the morning and the 20s for most of the afternoon, according to CNN Meteorologist Allison Chinchar.\n\nEven on a good day, the area is not for the inexperienced.\n\n“It’s a very remote, rugged area on the north side of the highway there. It is not a groomed area or a ski resort area. This is a backcountry area,” Moon said.\n\nAs a result of the avalanche, the Tahoe National Forest closed all lands and trails in the Castle Peak area until March 15, forest officials announced Thursday.\n\n“Due to the current instability of the snowpack and need to prioritize first responder access to the area, members of the public are prohibited from entering the closure area,” officials said in a social media post.\n\nFifteen people were on the guided trip this week, officials said. Blackbird Mountain Guides said six clients and three guides are among those killed, while five clients and one guide survived the avalanche.\n\nThe survivors consist of four men and two women; those confirmed and presumed dead include seven women and two men, Moon said.\n\nOne of the people killed was the spouse of a Tahoe Nordic Search and Rescue team member, making the search and recovery effort particularly wrenching for their personnel, Woo said.\n\nSome of the victims were also members of the Sugar Bowl Academy community, a private school and ski training center located near the avalanche site, the academy said in a statement.\n\nThe Blackbird Mountain Guides group had spent three days traversing Castle Peak’s wild terrain and staying in huts near Donner Summit — an area that before 2020 was closed to the public for nearly a century.\n\nAs the group made their way back to civilization Tuesday morning, one of the skiers spotted an oncoming avalanche, said Nevada County sheriff’s operations Capt. Rusty Greene, citing a survivor’s account.\n\nMoon said the avalanche was classified as a 2.5 on a five-level scale that measures the destructive potential of moving avalanche debris.\n\n“A two would bury a person. A three would bury a house, and it’s right in the middle of those two,” Moon told CNN.\n\nThe snowpack the skiers had been traveling on had a weak layer that had been loaded up with snow, making conditions ripe for an avalanche, according to Chris Feutrier, USDA forest supervisor for the Tahoe National Forest. The area was under the second-highest level, a 4 of 5, of an avalanche threat Tuesday.\n\nAt 11:30 a.m., the Nevada County dispatch center received a 911 call reporting the avalanche, Moon said. Though dozens of search and rescue personnel swarmed to the area, it would take crews several hours to reach the group in “horrific” conditions, she said.\n\n“Lots of snow, gale force winds, winds making it impossible to see,” Moon said of the conditions. For their own safety, rescue crews had to proceed at a “slow and steady pace.”\n\nAs the surviving skiers — some of whom were injured — waited, they scrambled to form a makeshift shelter and stay warm, Moon said. They also attempted to find the rest of their group, and were able to locate three bodies before rescuers arrived.\n\nBefore rescue units arrived on the scene, they knew at least six people had survived. The surviving group had been communicating with them via emergency beacons and iPhone SOS signals, Moon said. One of the guides was able to communicate with rescuers by text during the hours crews were trying to reach them.\n\nTwo of the survivors were unable to walk due to their injuries, the sheriff said. Rescuers were able to get them over two miles of snow to the awaiting snowcats. Two people rescued were later transported to hospital, authorities said.\n\nThe bodies of the skiers killed in the avalanche had to be left behind, authorities explained, as the sheer terrain and extreme weather made it dangerous for first responders to coordinate their removal.\n\nTuesday’s tragedy marks the deadliest avalanche in the US since 1981, when 11 people died in an avalanche on Ingraham Glacier on Mount Rainier in Washington, according to the Associated Press.\n\nBlackbird Mountain Guides said all four guides on the trip were American Mountain Guides Association trained or certified in backcountry skiing and guides in the field had been in communication with senior guides at their base about conditions and route decisions.\n\nBlackbird said it is still working to understand exactly what happened and that investigations are underway.\n\nThe company suspended all field operations through at least February 22, as it supports families and staff.\n\n“We ask that people following this tragedy refrain from speculating. We don’t have all the answers yet, and it may be some time before we do. In the meantime, please keep those impacted in your hearts,” the company said.\n\nThe sheriff’s office said Thursday in a statement to Reuters that it was conducting an investigation into whether criminal negligence was involved, “in addition to the coroner’s death investigations.”\n\nIt cautioned the investigation was in the preliminary stages and it was too early to name a specific target of any possible charges, Reuters reported.\n\nCNN has reached out to the sheriff’s office and the Nevada County District Attorney’s Office, which would decide on any possible charges. The attorney’s office declined to comment to Reuters.\n\nThe California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) also said Thursday it has up to six months to complete its investigation into Blackbird Mountain Guides and issue citations if workplace safety regulations were violated, KXTV reported.\n\nCNN has reached out to Cal/OSHA, the sheriff’s department and Blackbird Mountain Guides.\n\nThough survivors made it safely off the mountain, families of the deceased are enduring a dayslong wait to be reunited with their loved ones’ remains. The mission, Moon said, has gone “from a rescue to a recovery.”\n\nAuthorities have been in regular contact with the families, but the Nevada County Sheriff’s Office said Thursday it is unable to confirm the identifications, ages or cities of origin for all of the deceased victims “until the recovery mission is completed.”\n\n“It’s a difficult conversation to have with loved ones,” Moon said Wednesday. “I can’t even imagine the amount of questions and stress that those families are going through right now.”\n\nA community vigil in memory of the victims will be held at 6 p.m. Sunday in downtown Truckee. Additionally, there will be an interfaith service at Church of the Mountains at 5:30 p.m. Monday.\n\n“The best thing we can do is surround our athletes and families with care and support while providing the necessary space and time for grief and healing,” Stephen McMahon, executive director of the Sugar Bowl Academy, said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN’s Chris Dolce, Mary Gilbert, Cindy Von Quednow, Martin Goillandeau and Chimaine Pouteau contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "A mountaineer who left his girlfriend to freeze to death on Austria’s highest mountain abandoned an ex-partner on the same peak just two years before, a court heard.\n\nThomas Plamberger, 39, was given a five-month suspended sentence on Thursday after he was found guilty of gross negligent manslaughter over the death of Kerstin Gurtner in Jan 2025.\n\nThey were just 150ft from the Grossglockner’s 12,460ft summit in the Austrian Alps when Ms Gurtner, 33, collapsed from exhaustion at around 8.50pm with temperatures as low as -20C.\n\nPlamberger decided to leave her and climb back down the mountain to seek help. But in the six hours he was gone, Ms Gurtner died from extreme cold.\n\nIn a case that has drawn global attention, Plamberger’s lawyer described her death as a “tragic accident” and said his client had left the mountain by “mutual agreement”.\n\nBut it was alleged during the trial at Innsbruck regional court in Tyrol, western Austria, that Plamberger had left a former girlfriend, Andrea B, on the same mountainside just two years earlier.\n\nAndrea, who was in a relationship with the defendant from May to September 2023, told the court he had abandoned her during a nighttime descent because he thought she was too slow.\n\n“The atmosphere was bad. And then he was suddenly gone,” she said. “My headlamp had gone out, I was alone, crying and screaming.\n\n“He just left me there, completely alone. He went ahead. That was our last mountain hike,” she said.\n\nAndrea added that he had told her not to “make a big deal out of it” and that he could be short-tempered when she expressed fear.\n\n“When I was scared, he tended to be grumpy. ‘Don’t be such a baby,’ he would say, for example,” she told the court.\n\nThe couple had taken part in several mountain tours together during their brief four-month relationship.\n\nOn the fatal climb with Ms Gurtner, the court heard the pair were around 50m below the summit and were underprepared for the extreme freezing conditions.\n\nThe ruling noted that the ascent was “1,000 leagues beyond” Ms Gurtner’s experience and that she had placed herself “under the responsibility” of her more-experienced partner.\n\nThe defendant pleaded not guilty, claiming the situation spun out of control mid-climb.\n\nWebcam footage clearly shows the couple’s emergency torches as they ascend the mountain from 6pm. But six hours later, the light slowly fades as they lose power.\n\nRescuers attempted to make contact with Plamberger by phone but he allegedly had it switched off before contacting Alpine Police at 12.35am.\n\nHe left Ms Gurtner at 2am and made his way down the other side of the mountain, contacting mountain rescue at 3.30am.\n\nA helicopter attempted a rescue at 7.10am but it had to be called off because of strong winds.\n\nRescuers were seen climbing the mountain at around 10am but by the time they reached Ms Gurtner, she was dead.\n\nShe had died of hypothermia, with lab analysis later detecting a viral infection.\n\nThe court also imposed a fine of €9,400 (£8,000) on Plamberger. The climber can appeal the verdict.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Friends and family are mourning the death of a Brown University sophomore who died Tuesday, Feb. 17, at her residence hall on campus.\n\nAnnie Song, who graduated from high school in Washington state, was studying public health and policy, according to Brown.\n\nShe \"pursued a wide range of interests in her coursework and through engagement with organizations both at Brown and in the local community,\" the university said in a message to the Brown community.\n\nThe cause and manner of Song's death are undetermined, according to a Providence police spokeswoman. The police responded to the residence hall on George Street Tuesday and saw no obvious signs of trauma or evidence of foul play, spokeswoman Kristy DosReis said. The police are still investigating along with the Rhode Island Office of the State Medical Examiners, she said.\n\nA GoFundMe fundraiser has been established by friends of Song to support her funeral and transportation costs back home to Seattle, Washington.\n\n\"Annie was the most beautiful and bright presence in the lives of everyone she met. She was a kind, thoughtful friend who always put others before her and made us laugh like no one else we knew,\" the GoFundMe page says. \"She was so talented in so many different areas and so passionate about so many things that we couldn’t even begin to tell you about her achievements and, more importantly, her dreams.\"\n\nAccording to the message to the Brown community, Song was working toward a dual concentration in public health and international and public affairs, with plans for a potential internship in Washington, D.C., this summer.\n\nShe served as a Meiklejohn peer advisor and was involved in several student organizations, including the Infectious Disease Society and the Korean American Students Association. She was also a program development intern with the nonprofit Women’s Refugee Care in Providence.\n\nIn high school, Song volunteered at a local hospital and served as co-president of one of the state’s top-performing Science Olympiad teams, according to Brown. She was an accomplished musician and was selected as the only violinist from Washington to participate in the 2023 National Youth Orchestra, the university said.\n\n\"Our hearts are with everyone from the Brown community and beyond who are affected by this profound loss - and especially Annie’s family and friends. We will keep the community informed in the weeks ahead as we determine plans to gather and remember Annie’s life,\" the university said in its message to the Brown community.\n\nThe message was sent from Pat Poitevien, vice president for campus life and student services, and Ethan Pollock, dean of the college.\n\nThe message also urged students in need of support to reach out to counseling and support services. It included links and contact information for those services.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: GoFundMe set up for Brown University student Annie Song, who on campus",

    "description": "A new study has analyzed mummified remains of cheetahs in Saudi Arabia caves. The results could help reintroduce cheetahs to the Arabian Peninsula, researchers say.",
    "fullText": "When scientists with the National Center for Wildlife in Saudi Arabia were surveying caves in search of wildlife in 2022 and 2023, they came across something unexpected: seven naturally mummified cheetahs in five caves near the northern city of Arar. The remains were largely intact with well-preserved soft tissue and skeletons.\n\nNow, an analysis of three of the mummies’ DNA has revealed something that could help reintroduce cheetahs to the Arabian Peninsula wilderness, researchers say.\n\nCheetahs once inhabited much of Africa and parts of Asia, but now they are found in only 9% of their historic range. It was previously believed that the Asiatic cheetah, called Acinonyx jubatus venaticus, was the only subspecies ever present in Saudi Arabia. The species is now critically endangered, with a small wild population remaining in Iran. Across the peninsula, cheetahs were deemed locally extinct in the 1970s.\n\nBut when the researchers analyzed three of the mummies, they found that two of the oldest specimens were genetically closer to the subspecies Acinonyx jubatus hecki, known as the Northwest African cheetah.\n\nThe findings, published in January in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, reveal that at least two subspecies of cheetah once roamed the Arabian Peninsula. The discovery could help reintroduction efforts as scientists now know which cheetah lineages once lived in the peninsula and have evidence of their success in the area.\n\n“It was highly surprising,” said lead author Ahmed Al Boug, an ecologist researcher and deputy CEO of the National Center for Wildlife in Saudi Arabia. “This finding represents the first documented case of natural mummification in cheetahs, and first physical evidence that cheetah subspecies occurred in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\n“Moreover, cave use by cheetahs is extremely atypical behavior, making both the discovery itself and the context in which it occurred entirely unexpected,” he added in an email.\n\nThe researchers are investigating why the cheetahs entered and used the caves; they do not believe it was accidental or for isolation as they neared the end of life. Nonetheless, the cave environment and its hyper-arid conditions contributed to the mummification of the cheetahs, Al Boug said.\n\nAlongside the seven cheetah mummies, the researchers came across skeletal remains of 54 additional cats within the caves. The study authors dated five of them and found the oldest to be about 4,000 years old. Two mummies that were analyzed date from about 130 to 1,870 years ago, according to the study. The authors plan to investigate further the remaining mummies and skeleton fragments to potentially identify the subspecies of additional samples, Al Boug said.\n\n“This discovery is significant in that it represents the easternmost record of an African cheetah subspecies and demonstrates that northern Saudi Arabia was occupied by multiple cheetah lineages over millennia,” Al Boug said. “Together, these findings refine our understanding of cheetah landscape use, clarify timelines of regional extirpation, and improve resolution on the subspecies historically present in this region.”\n\nTo identify the subspecies of the mummified cheetahs, the authors extracted complete genome sequences from three of the seven remains. It was the first time DNA has been extracted from naturally mummified cheetahs or large felines, according to a news release from the journal.\n\nAdrian Tordiffe, a veterinary wildlife specialist based in India, said it is surprising that some of the cheetah remains were only about a century old as it reveals that these cats lived in Saudi Arabia far more recently than people realized.\n\n“Even more striking is that the remains show different subspecies of cheetahs lived there at different times,” said Tordiffe, also a lecturer at South Africa’s University of Pretoria, in an email. He was not involved with the study.\n\n“This tells us the Arabian Peninsula was once an important natural bridge for cheetahs, not an ecological dead end.”\n\nTordiffe added that the discovery gives conservationists clear evidence of what species lived in the area in a not-so-distant past. “Because we now know which cheetah lineages lived in Arabia, reintroduction efforts can focus on using animals that are ecologically appropriate, rather than bringing in cheetahs from completely different environments.\n\n“The remains also include young animals and adults, showing that cheetahs weren’t just passing through, they were breeding and thriving. That tells us the landscape once supported full cheetah populations, especially alongside prey species like gazelles, which are now being successfully restored in Saudi Arabia. This research turns cheetah reintroduction from a hopeful idea into a well-informed plan based on real evidence,” Tordiffe said.\n\nWildlife populations in the Arabian Peninsula were historically diminished by the impact of humans, including overhunting and land-use changes, Al Boug said. But now, with large, protected areas in the Middle East, many of the primary threats to cheetahs, such as habitat degradation, human disturbance and competition with lions have been reduced, he added. As a result, Al Boug said he believes that Saudi Arabia is well-positioned to support the recovery of a species once widespread across the region.\n\n“Showing the length of time the cheetah lived in Saudi Arabia shows that they were an important part of the ecosystem and not just passing through,” said Laurie Marker, founder and executive director of the Cheetah Conservation Fund, a nonprofit that acts to prevent the extinction of cheetahs. Marker was not involved with the new study, but the fund is partnered with the National Center for Wildlife for cheetah reintroduction efforts in Saudi Arabia.\n\n“Cheetahs and other top predators play important roles in the ecosystem. Cheetahs are great hunters and eat rapidly then also leave remains for feeding other species. Therefore where we find top predators there is a greater amount of biodiversity as they feed the other small mammals, birds and insects,” she added in an email.\n\n“As the Saudis are bringing back their wildlife species, the cheetah will be an important addition to rewilding, bringing back a healthy ecosystem to the desert once again.”\n\nTaylor Nicioli is a freelance journalist based in New York City.\n\n Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.",

    "fullText": "Initial reports on Bukayo Saka’s new contract with Arsenal suggested it was a five-year deal to 2031, but Sami Mokbel of the BBC reports that it’s more of a “five-season” deal to 2030.\n\nIn effect, that means the contract actually lasts four-and-a-half years, taking us to the end of the current campaign and then four years beyond that.\n\nArsenal and Saka have been in contract talks for quite a while now, so it’s possible the confusion stems from the fact that when negotiations stepped up last summer, it was five years to 2030 at the time.\n\nThat means Arsenal will need to renegotiate Saka’s terms slightly sooner than previously believed, but the deal will still last until the winger is only a few months from his 29th birthday. So he’s expected to spend much of his prime with the Gunners, whether he extends again or not.\n\nMokbel adds that Saka’s new contract will make him Arsenal’s best-paid player, on wages in excess of £300,000 per week.\n\nSaka’s previous deal was set to expire in 2027, so this was definitely one the club needed to get sorted before moving into his final season.\n\nThe focus is now purely on football and staying fit. Saka scored his eighth goal of the season on Wednesday, in addition to his seven assists, but he was forced off early having already had two (relatively brief) spells on the sidelines through injuries earlier this season.\n\nArsenal are still competing for trophies on four fronts right now, but the Gunners need their attacking players to step up in a big way over the next few months if that’s going to remain the case.",

    "description": "Time is ticking for Illinois lawmakers to make a counter-offer to the Chicago Bears.",
    "fullText": "Time is ticking for Illinois lawmakers to make a counter-offer to the Chicago Bears.\n\nThis comes after Indiana advanced legislation that clears the way for the Bears to build a new stadium in Hammond.\n\nThat bill is likely to pass Indiana's house by next week.\n\nThe Bears called the move out of Indiana's \"meaningful step forward\" in efforts to build a stadium in the Wolf Lake area.\n\nHammond Mayor Thomas McDermott Jr. believes this is a win for Indiana and Bears fans.\n\n\"Downtown Chicago or on the South Side, of Chicago, they should be applauding this move because we're going to be much closer to you, the fan, than if the Bears move to Arlington Heights,\" Mayor McDermott Jr. said.\n\nHowever, Governor JB Pritzker said he was disappointed by the Bears statement Thursday.\n\nPritzker said two days ago his team and the Bears had a three-hour positive discussion about plans in Illinois.\n\n\"I've been a Bears fan for a very long time, and I wanted them to, you know, perform, stay play here, continue to believe that that's the best thing for them. I believe they understand in their hearts that that may be the best thing for them,\" Governor Pritzker said.\n\nThe mega project bill that was supposed to go before an Illinois House committee Thursday has since been rescheduled for next Thursday.\n\nState officials said they wanted to tweak it and believe they are close to a deal on bringing the Bears to Arlington Heights.\n\nThe Chicago Bears have released a new statement on a potential new stadium as Indiana lawmakers moved forward with a bill to bring the team to Hammond.\n\nThe Bears said in a statement, \"The passage of SB 27 would mark the most meaningful step forward in our stadium planning efforts to date. We are committed to finishing the remaining site-specific necessary due diligence to support our vision to build a world-class stadium near the Wolf Lake area in Hammond, Indiana. We appreciate the leadership shown by Governor Braun, Speaker Huston, Senator Mishler and members of the Indiana General Assembly in establishing this critical framework and path forward to deliver a premier venue for all of Chicagoland and a destination for Bears fans and visitors from across the globe. We value our partnership and look forward to continuing to build our working relationship together.\"\n\n\"No, I don't want to see the Chicago Bears leave Illinois,\" fan Greg Cutler said. \"It's the Chicago Bears! What are you going to do? It's Chicago!\"\n\nThere was strong reaction after the Bears signaled a possible move across the state line.\n\n\"If they were to actually move to Hammond, Indiana, they would be dead to me,\" one fan told ABC7.\n\nThursday morning legislators voted unanimously to push a bill out of the Ways and Means Committee. The bill would create the Northwest Indiana Stadium authority similar to Illinois Sports Facilities Authority. This could convince the Chicago Bears to cross state line and build a new stadium.\n\nLawmakers said the Bears would pay $2 billion toward construction costs.\n\nThe proposal includes new food, beverage, and innkeepers taxes in Indiana's northwest counties to help pay for the stadium and infrastructure.\n\nThe Chicago Bears signaled a shift to potentially build a new stadium in Hammond as Indiana lawmakers moved forward with a bill to lure the NFL team.\n\nAmong the people who spoke during Thursday's hearing include Hammond's Mayor Thomas McDermott Jr and the Indiana Speaker of the House Rep. Todd Huston.\n\n\"Hammond is ready to partner with the Chicago Bears, basically Hammond would do whatever it takes to help make this project a success,\" Mayor McDermott Jr. said. \"Hammond is uniquely positions for this moment, we are part of the Chicagoland region.\"\n\nThe Hammond mayor spoke Thursday after an Indiana Bears stadium bill passed.\n\n\"We've had excellent conversations with the Chicago Bears and we are forging a relationship that would be a foundation for a public/private partnership leaned on construction of a world class stadium,\" Speaker Huston said.\n\nIndiana Governor Mike Braun said in a statement, \"\"Indiana is open for business, and our pro-growth environment continues to attract major opportunities like this partnership with the Chicago Bears. We've identified a promising site near Wolf Lake in Hammond and established a broad framework for negotiating a final deal. The amendment to Senate Bill 27 puts forward the essential framework to complete this agreement, contingent upon site due diligence proceeding smoothly.\"\n\nGovernor JB Pritzker, speaking Thursday, said he was disappointed by the Bears statement.\n\nIllinois Governor JB Pritzker said he was \"surprised\" after the Chicago Bears' signaled a shift to build a stadium in Indiana.\n\n\"It was a surprise to us,\" Governor Pritzker said. \"The Bears actually, yesterday, we completed more than three hours, my team did, of discussions with the Bears, very positive discussions and mostly agreed on a bill that would move forward this morning, but they asked us not to move forward with it this morning because they said they wanted to tweak a couple of items in the bill that were things that we were working on them and so to have a statement put out by the Bears...Now they saying to us that that statement is not some confirmation that they are moving to Indiana but rather that Indiana had asked them to say that they are going to move forward with the negotiations in Indiana, but I have to say it is very disappointing to hear that they would put that statement out but not saying about the advancement that has been made in Illinois. We are waiting to hear from the Bears what they would like to do next.\"\n\nPritzker and his staff, and lawmakers have been meeting with Bears brass behind closed doors.\n\nThe news out of Indiana came as an Illinois House committee hearing that could have brought the Bears a step closer to a new stadium in Illinois was canceled.\n\nThe House Revenue and Finance Committee canceled a meeting Wednesday to hear the \"Mega Project\" bill.\n\nNo date has been set on a new hearing.\n\nSEE ALSO | Talks of Bears moving to suburbs progressing, Pritzker says, amid attempts to lure team to Indiana\n\nThe bill could give the Bears a long-term property tax break for their proposed stadium in Arlington Heights.\n\nWATCH: Gov. Pritzker says Bears statements on Indiana stadium 'was a surprise'\n\nGary Mayor Eddie Melton released a statement saying, \"Today's announcement that the State of Indiana has selected Hammond for the new Bears stadium marks a major shift for our region. While Gary presented a compelling case, the State's decision now sets the stage for a new chapter in Northwest Indiana.\n\n\"While I would be less than honest if I said there isn't some level of disappointment, I am encouraged to see meaningful progress in this process. Major decisions like this require movement, clarity, and commitment - and today represents a step forward for Northwest Indiana.\n\n\"My primary concern remains ensuring that previously committed funding, particularly the innkeeper's tax revenue designated for the operations of the Lake County Convention Center in Gary, is protected and honored. We must safeguard investments that support our long-term growth and stability.\n\n\"Regional success benefits us all. Should this project move forward following the Bears due diligence exorts in Hammond, I will join leaders from across the state in welcoming the Bears to Northwest Indiana. A development of this magnitude creates a rising tide for the entire region. Gary is uniquely positioned to amplify this economic momentum-serving as the western gateway to the Indiana Dunes National Park, served by three major interstate corridors and an international airport.\n\n\"Gary's progress does not depend on one opportunity. Gary's comeback is real, it is measurable, and its momentum continues.\n\n\"Hammond, don't fumble, we're ready to recover.\"",

    "description": "Joshua was injured in a car crash in December, in which two of his teammates were killed",
    "fullText": "Anthony Joshua could return to the ring sooner than expected, after the boxing star was involved in a fatal car crash in December.\n\nJust days after Joshua knocked out Jake Paul, beating the influencer in six rounds, he suffered injuries as a passenger in a car accident in Nigeria. The crash claimed the lives of two of Joshua’s teammates: Sina Ghami and Latif “Latz” Ayodele.\n\nIn the fallout of that accident, Joshua’s fighting future has been up in the air, with some fans questioning whether the former world heavyweight champion would box again.\n\nHowever, “AJ” was soon back to training, and now his promoter has suggested that a competitive return could come as soon as July.\n\n“Look, originally the plan with AJ was for him to fight in March, and then fight Tyson Fury in August,” Eddie Hearn told media on Thursday. “That’s not happening, he’s not fighting Tyson Fury next.\n\n“He’s going to come back – I believe – late summer, but physically he’s not yet in a position to return to camp. So, I’m planning, but he’s just resting and preparing.\n\n“So for me, I’m looking at options to get him back in the ring in July time, but we’ll only know if that’s a real possibility when he returns to camp, which will hopefully be in the next couple of weeks or a month.”\n\nWhen asked whether Joshua’s next bout could be somewhat of a warm-up for a tougher test, Matchroom’s Hearn said: “I think every fight’s dangerous, coming off what he’s come off, but yeah, I think...\n\n“We’re open to the Tyson Fury fight, but probably more likely end of the year, maybe early 2027.”\n\nPLANS FOR AJ'S RETURN‼️\n\nEddie Hearn has confirmed to BoxingScene that he is planning a July return for Anthony Joshua.\n\nWho should he face?🤔 pic.twitter.com/40GBcbizVM\n\n— BoxingScene.com (@boxingscene) February 19, 2026\n\nJoshua, 36, was linked with kickboxing champion Rico Verhoeven prior to December’s crash, but Hearn said: “I believe he’s fighting... rumours of him fighting [Oleksandr] Usyk, yeah.”\n\nUsyk, who twice beat Joshua on points, is currently the unified heavyweight champion, while Fabio Wardley holds the WBO title. Elsewhere in the division, Fury will box Arslanbek Makhmudov on 11 April, as the Briton emerges from retirement for the fifth time.\n\nAs Hearn hinted, Joshua and Fury were on course for a long-awaited showdown this year, but AJ’s accident has disrupted those plans. It is currently expected that Fury, 37, will target a world-title fight if he beats Russia’s Makhmudov.\n\nFury vs Makhmudov will stream live on Netflix, like Joshua’s win over Paul, and it will take place one week after Derek Chisora fights Deontay Wilder. Chisora is a friend of Joshua, who has long been linked to a possible clash with Wilder.",

But I think this one is especially difficult considering the circumstances where West Ham are and the run that they've had recently.\"\n\nThe Bournemouth boss feels the Hammers have been \"one of the best teams lately in the Premier League\" and his side need to \"be ready to start strong\" to prevent West Ham from scoring first, as they have done in recent games.\n\nAfter receiving a touchline ban for his third yellow card of the season, Iraola has been discussing how he plans to help from the stands: \"I don't wear the thing on the ear and I'm close to the analyst. Normally I go with Ryan [Dawes], and he's the one communicating everything. But it's true that we sometimes, with the subs, we use just text messages. So we see everything clear.\"\n\nHe does not yet know where he will be sitting in the stadium and is a \"little bit worried\" about the time it might take to get to the dressing room at half time, so they will just have to \"see what the best option is\".\n\nOn Marcos Senesi's future after the defender didn't move in the January transfer window: \"I think the situation is still open. I think it's not easy. We have references from other seasons and sometimes they decide to re-sign, sometimes not, but I don't think Marcos has taken any decision.\"\n\nHear full commentary of West Ham v Bournemouth on Saturday from 17:30 GMT on 5 Live and BBC Sounds\n\nFollow all of Friday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news\n\nGot a question about Bournemouth?

    "fullText": "Former Manchester United midfielder Owen Hargreaves has explained the tactical change implemented by caretaker manager Michael Carrick that has inspired the recent golden run. The English manager replaced former head coach Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford in the middle of last month.\n\nThe Red Devils opted to part ways with the Portuguese head coach following a dismal 14-month reign that failed to live up to expectations. The English giants struggled to string together results under Amorim, finishing 15th in the league last season.\n\nWhen even a summer of reinforcements worth over £200 million failed to improve results – United won three consecutive games just once under Amorim – INEOS opted for a change at the turn of the year. Carrick was placed in the hot seat at Old Trafford until the end of the season, when a permanent appointment is expected.\n\nThe Englishman has registered four wins and a draw in his five games in charge so far, which includes stunning wins against Manchester City, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Fulham. While West Ham United ended the 100% record, there is a sense of positivity around the Theatre of Dreams that has not been evident for a while.\n\nHargreaves has now explained how Carrick has managed to get the Red Devils firing on all cylinders.\n\nSpeaking on The Breakdown for TNT Sports, Hargreaves insisted that Carrick’s change of system has transformed United. He said: “Under Carrick virtually every player is playing a different position except the goalkeeper.”\n\n“Two centre-backs went from playing in a three to a two. The wing backs, now playing as full backs. Went from a midfield two to now playing in a three. Went from having 10’s to wingers. Actually, he’s changed the whole team and everybody. It’s not rocket science. Everybody’s in their natural position and they’re performing.”\n\n“Put Bruno in as a 10 and let him go create. How Kobbie hasn’t played football in a year is mind-blowing. One of the best young talents in the world of football. And for a kid not to play for a year and to come in and play against City and Arsenal and basically run the games is a testament.”\n\n“And obviously Carrick knows that position, but I just think Carras right now, he’s been flawless. He hasn’t got one thing wrong and I’m just delighted for him because the fans have really suffered and it feels like Old Trafford’s back. The fans are happy, but most importantly they’re winning. That’s all this is about is winning. And when you win, it fixes a lot of things.”\n\nUnited’s spectacular form under Carrick has prompted talk of a permanent appointment at the end of the season. The Red Devils have also developed a never-say-die attitude under the Englishman, as evident in the wins against Arsenal and Fulham, and the draw against West Ham.\n\nSeveral former players have already urged United to consider Carrick for the permanent job, including club legend Wayne Rooney. The Red Devils remain linked with quite a few candidates for the job, including Carlo Ancelotti, Luis Enrique, Oliver Glasner and Roberto De Zerbi.\n\nHowever, a recent report relayed by The Peoples Person states that Carrick is now the favourite for the job.\n\nCarrick has already displayed qualities that make him a fine fit for the job, and his position will be further strengthened if he manages to secure a top-four finish this season.\n\nFeatured image James Fearn via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Same names to keep an eye out for in Indy next week - could any be of interest to the Jaguars?",
    "fullText": "The NFL Combine is less than a week away. With the NFL world descending on Lucas Oil Stadium for the annual meat market, who are the prospects that could make a big impression in the biggest job interview of their lives? And could any be on the radar of the Jacksonville Jaguars? Let’s take a look:\n\nJonah Coleman is RB2 in the class and it's not close based on film + statistics:\n\n– Creative when play shuts down\n– Vision, feet, movement in sync\n– Best RB after contact in class\n\nHe's very good at pressing the LOS.\n\nCreative runner that turns a lot of these type of plays into… pic.twitter.com/wsR0QKU60W\n\n— Snoog's Fantasy HQ (@FFSnoog) February 13, 2026\n\nWith the combine focusing on raw measurables, Jonah Coleman has every opportunity to push himself into the same tier as Jeremiyah Love next week. Coleman isn’t expected to be the quickest running back in the room; he’s a short, dense ‘bowling ball’ style back whose physical style of running has made him a consistent contributor for the Huskies over three seasons. What Coleman needs to show is that he’s fast enough, and a 4.5 second forty time at his size and play strength will certainly turn heads.\n\nWith Travis Etienne’s future in Jacksonville still unsure, running back may be a target position for the Jaguars in the draft. Coleman’s 4.29 yards after contact average (in the 97th percentile at his position) will appeal to James Gladstone, whose selection of Bhayshul Tuten last year shows his penchant for pinball wizards in the backfield.\n\nMississippi State WR Brenen Thompson beating both of the TCU corners on double moves.\n\nHe's definitely gonna fly next week in Indy. pic.twitter.com/fOePdNM99c\n\n— Derrick (@Steelers_DB) February 20, 2026\n\nLife in Starkville has been tough the past few seasons. But wide receiver Brenen Thompson made a wise decision leaving Oklahoma for Mississippi State last year, enjoying a breakout campaign that saw him break 1,000 yards receiving. Key to that production was his unparalleled speed, with many expecting him to challenge Matthew Golden’s 4.29 second forty from last season. Thompson’s average depth of target (aDOT) last season was an outrageous 18.4 yards – for context, the NFL average is around 11.0.\n\nAt 5’9” and 170lbs, there’ll be concerns about Thompson’s longevity in the NFL. But athleticism grabs the headlines at the combine. I’m not sure if it’s a profile the Jaguars front office will be interested in, but with rumors persisting about Brian Thomas being traded, adding to the position group is a distinct possibility.\n\nThe right NFL OL coach is going to turn Arizona State's Max Iheanachor into a Pro Bowler. pic.twitter.com/ITAvB6DWci\n\n— Tyler Brooke (@TylerDBrooke) February 5, 2026\n\nIf you’re looking for a physical freak with unreasonable athleticism, Iheanachor might be your guy. Starring at the Senior Bowl, the former Sun Devil has already elevated his stock through the early part of draft season. And if scouts want to go and check the tape, they’ll see a prospect who allowed zero sacks on almost 500 pass-blocking snaps in 2025.\n\nStanding at 6’6”, weighing 330lbs and having ludicrous 34.5” arms, Iheanachor is a mountain of a man. But it’s a mountain that can move, with him expected to run somewhere in the region of a 5.15 second forty and show off his lateral agility in the other tests. Iheanachor might have pushed himself into day one contention, but if he’s still there on Friday, could the Jags be interested in bolstering their offensive line?\n\n#SouthCarolina CB Brandon Cisse is one of the best athletes in the 2026 drafts CB class.\n\nTwitched up defender with elite speed and fluidity, very sticky in man coverage and has a ton of versatility. Top-50 player on my Big Board. pic.twitter.com/Vq1bmHJ97X\n\n— Andy (@AndyyNFL) December 12, 2025\n\nThe secondary is a big need for the Jaguars this offseason, and I would be surprised if they didn’t at least partially address it in free agency. But should they be looking for someone who can start on the outside as a rookie, then perhaps Brandon Cisse is on their radar…\n\nCisse has elite athleticism across the board; expectations of a forty inch vertical jump and a sub-four second 20-yard shuttle demonstrate his explosiveness. At approximately 6’0” and 195lbs he’s got the measurables, and he showed a big improvement on his career numbers during his one year as a Gamecock. 19 solo tackles tells you he can be left on an island, and his proficiency in press man coverage could appeal to Gladstone. With his stock about to explode, it would likely take a trade back into the first round to make him a Jaguar.\n\nOne thing about Red Murdock (#2) is that he'll light a mf up pic.twitter.com/Lfyi2jv3aI\n\n— JP Acosta (@acosta32_jp) February 13, 2026\n\nOne of the coolest names in the draft also belongs to one of the most productive players in this year’s class. Red Murdock has dominated for the Bulls the last two seasons, racking up 298 tackles, 30 TFL’s and seven sacks during that time. Murdock is expected to perform extremely well in the shuttle and mirror drills at the combine, whose monstrous stats have often been attributed to his sideline to sideline speed and read-and-chase ability.\n\nIf Devin Lloyd leaves town during free agency, a huge chunk of the Jaguars’ turnovers from last season leaves with him. In that regard Murdock could be the perfect replacement; the former Buffalo linebacker set an FBS record with 17 career forced fumbles, all in the past three seasons. Murdock is likely to still be on the board on Day 3, even with a strong performance in Indy. Value like that might be too hard for this front office to ignore.",

    "fullText": "What stood out most was the diversity of excellence on display. Technical precision shaped events where control and timing meant everything, while endurance and pacing defined races that demanded strategic patience. In team competitions, success came from unity — athletes moving, reacting, and trusting one another with near-perfect synchronization. Individual champions, meanwhile, demonstrated the ability to manage pressure with clarity and composure, delivering performances that felt both disciplined and inspired.\n\nFebruary 19 also highlighted the evolving narratives of the Games. Some athletes strengthened already impressive legacies, while others seized breakthrough moments that signaled the arrival of new contenders on the Olympic stage. Across sports and nations, the day reflected the universal pursuit of mastery — not just to win, but to perform at one’s absolute limit when it matters most.\n\nSport: Figure Skating — Women’s Singles\nMedal: Gold\n\nLiu delivered a performance that felt both technically masterful and emotionally powerful. Her skating showed remarkable control, blending precision jumps with expressive artistry that held the arena’s attention throughout. After stepping away from competition earlier in her career, her return to the top felt deeply personal and inspiring. This gold medal wasn’t just a victory — it was the culmination of resilience, growth, and renewed passion.\n\nSport: Ice Hockey — Women’s Tournament\nMedal: Gold\n\nTeam USA captured gold with a performance defined by grit, discipline, and relentless pressure. They stayed composed through tense moments and executed with confidence when the game demanded it most. Their victory reflected not just talent, but trust built through years of competing together. It was a championship earned through resilience and unity from the first puck drop to the final celebration.\n\nSport: Ski Mountaineering — Women’s Final\nMedal: Gold\n\nFatton powered through the course with impressive endurance and tactical awareness. Her pacing was disciplined, conserving energy before making decisive moves when it mattered most. She looked completely in control of both terrain and tempo. The gold confirmed her status as one of the premier athletes in ski mountaineering’s Olympic debut era.\n\nSport: Ski Mountaineering — Men’s Sprint\nMedal: Gold\n\nCardona Coll delivered an explosive sprint performance marked by speed and precision. He attacked the course with confidence, maintaining momentum through every technical section. His acceleration in the decisive stretch left no room for doubt. The victory showcased both his physical power and sharp race instincts.\n\nSport: Speed Skating — Men’s 1500m\nMedal: Gold\n\nNing skated a brilliantly controlled race, balancing patience with perfectly timed acceleration. His rhythm never faltered, and each lap built momentum toward a commanding finish. The precision of his pacing showed deep strategic awareness. Crossing the line first felt like the natural result of total composure under pressure.\n\nSport: Nordic Combined — Men’s Team Sprint\nMedal: Gold\n\nOftebro and Skoglund combined strength and synchronization to deliver a dominant team sprint performance. Their transitions were seamless, and each leg built momentum rather than merely maintaining it. They raced with clear trust in one another, executing strategy with precision from start to finish. The gold reflected both individual excellence and perfectly matched teamwork.\n\nThe highlights of February 19 captured the balance of intensity and artistry that defines the Winter Olympics. From commanding victories to emotionally charged breakthroughs, the day added meaningful chapters to the story of these Games. It was a reminder that Olympic success is measured not only in medals, but in moments of excellence that endure long after competition ends.\n\n— Enjoy free coverage of the top news & trending stories on The Big Lead —\n\nNFL: Former 49ers wide receiver announces immediate retirement from football\n\nOLYMPICS: Mikaela Shiffrin sends 2-word message after winning Olympic gold medal\n\nMLB: MLBPA chooses Tony Clark’s replacement one day after abrupt resignation\n\nNFL: College quarterback who won 7 Super Bowl rings as NFL executive dies\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: College Hall of Famer, father of Chicago Bulls coach, dies\n\nVIRAL: Red Sox issue, retract, reissue statement about Fanatics uniform snafu\n\nThe post Highlights from Winter Olympics 2026: Thursday, February 19 appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid resume their La Liga campaign on Saturday with a demanding trip to Osasuna, knowing there is little margin for error at the top of the table.\n\nFresh from their hard-fought 1-0 win over Benfica in Lisbon, Madrid return to domestic duties with confidence high and momentum firmly on their side.\n\nThat Champions League success added another layer of belief to a squad already riding an eight-match winning streak in the league.\n\nThose victories have propelled them to first place, edging ahead of Barcelona in what is shaping up to be a finely balanced title race.\n\nMadrid’s recent league performances have been defined by control rather than chaos.\n\nThey have conceded fewer goals than any other side in the division and have found ways to win even when not at their most fluent.\n\nKylian Mbappe remains central to their attacking threat, but the broader structure of the team has been equally important during this run.\n\nOsasuna, though, arrive in strong form of their own.\n\nThey are unbeaten in five league games and have quietly rebuilt confidence after an inconsistent first half of the season.\n\nThree wins and two draws in that spell have lifted them into mid-table, with an outside chance of pushing towards the European positions.\n\nTheir most recent outing, a disciplined goalless draw away from home, highlighted a side that has become increasingly organised and difficult to break down.\n\nAt home they have shown greater conviction, collecting the majority of their points in front of their own supporters.\n\nMadrid’s away record is among the best in the league, yet Osasuna will believe this is an opportunity to test the leaders’ depth and focus.\n\nThe timing of the fixture adds intrigue.\n\nWith the second leg against Benfica on the horizon, Madrid must guard against any lapse in intensity.\n\nAn early setback could energise the home crowd and turn the contest into a physical and tactical battle.\n\nFor Madrid, another victory would stretch their league streak and strengthen their hold on first place.\n\nFor Osasuna, extending their unbeaten run against the division’s top side would signal genuine progress.\n\nBoth teams enter in confident mood, setting up a clash that could hinge on patience as much as quality.",

    "fullText": "The NFL combine begins soon, running from Feb. 23 to March 2. To preview this important pre-draft event, we will be taking a position-by-position look at which prospects were invited and the level of need that the Indianapolis Colts have at each spot.\n\nThe NFL combine is held at Lucas Oil Stadium and is an opportunity for the top NFL draft prospects in this year’s class to go through measurements and various on-field drills, some of which are specific to their position group, and others measure the player’s overall athleticism.\n\nFor NFL teams, this event is another data point for them as they build out their draft profiles and big boards. However, it’s a significant data point, with players potentially flying up and down draft boards depending on how they perform.\n\nIn addition to the on-field drills, teams also get the opportunity to meet with players one-on-one as well, which is another important part of the evaluation process as they get to know them both on and off the field.\n\nUp next in our preview are the tight ends.\n\nWith Warren leading the way, the Colts are positioned well here. However, as you can see by the current roster, depth is needed. Specifically, another blocking presence is needed to pair with Warren. Shane Steichen uses his fair share of two tight end sets.\n\nMallory provides more of a pass-catching presence and has struggled to earn playing time. The Colts could look to bring back Alie-Cox and/or Ogletree to fill that blocking-specific role. Neither will break the salary cap bank.\n\nThen, of course, the draft is an option as well, if GM Chris Ballard wants to find a longer-term option to join Warren.\n\nJohn Michael Gyllenborg, Wyoming\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: 2026 NFL combine preview: Which tight ends were invited?",

    "fullText": "This year’s crop of starting pitchers has a couple of amazing arms that will cost you a first-round pick if you want to roster them, and as much as I hate to say it, taking a pitcher that high is akin to dancing with the devil in the pale moonlight.  The same two pitchers were the top two off the board last year, so the waters may seem safe, but beware.  Those same waters seemed safe two years ago when Spencer Strider was the top arm off the board. Here are the top 31-60 SP right now in fantasy baseball:\n\nHe’s likely going to miss the first month of the season after elbow surgery this past October to remove loose bodies and to shave down a bone spur in his left (pitching) arm.  He’s coming off the highest inning total of his career at age 33, so there is some concern for how much of a workload he will be able to handle in 2026, but when he’s on the mound, you’re getting a borderline elite talent.  Consistency and health have been the only things that have kept him from the top echelon of this list.  If you can get him in the mid rounds, he’s worth the pick as a high upside play since he has always been able to pile up Ks, and the wins should be there, pitching for the Yankees.\n\nThe arm talent has always been there for this 6’6″ lefty, but it’s taken some time to translate into fantasy relevance due to a combination of health issues and a bad home ballpark.  Last year, he was able to somewhat put it together for a career-high 28 starts and 150+ innings pitched, but he still missed some time due to a blister.  If last year is an indicator, he has traded in a bit of his swing and miss stuff for much-improved control, which makes him a legitimate 4-category threat.  He’s entering his age-28 season, and lefties tend to develop a little later, so I’m willing to invest in this being the season he is able to put it all together for 30+ starts.\n\nComing into last season, King was being drafted as a top-of-the-rotation anchor for many of our fantasy teams, but a shoulder injury cut 2025 short in May.  He was able to make it back from the shoulder, and then a knee ailment ended the comeback in August.  The positive news is that he made it back from the shoulder injury, and he looked very good when he was able to take the mound.  He’s just 30 years old coming into this year and has been given a clean bill of health.  If you can get a discount, grab him and bank on maybe 80-90% of what he did in 2024 as a baseline.\n\nWhen the Orioles acquired him, they were expecting him to slide right into their rotation and help them make a postseason push.  That was back in 2024.  While Kyle Stowers was mashing in Miami last year, Rogers began the season in the minors.  Thankfully, for O’s fans, Rogers was given the call at the end of May, and once he got to Baltimore, he never looked back.  In 109.2 innings over 18 starts, he posted an immaculate 1.81 era and 0.90 whip with 103 Ks and 9 wins.  He’s poised to anchor this Baltimore rotation along with Kyle Bradish in 2026.  I’m not buying him based on the small sample size numbers from 2025, but based on the increase in velocity and K rate.  He makes a great SP3 if you can get him in the 12th round or so.\n\nHe was the Rays ace last year, posting 11 wins while averaging a strikeout per inning over 167 frames.  Entering his age-28 season, he should be able to stay at around this level, and possibly even improve with the move back to Tropicana Field.  While he did allow more home runs at home last season, he actually had a much higher era on the road.  He doesn’t seem to have a ton of upside, but he should be a steady performer who could be pushed north of 180 innings pitched this season.\n\nHere’s another pitcher who has put up elite numbers without putting up a ton of innings pitched.  Rasmussen has now made it to his age-30 season without ever throwing more than 150 innings.  The good news?  He threw those 150 innings last season, and he didn’t die.  The Rays will keep him wrapped in bubble wrap again this year, so don’t expect more than 6 innings when he takes the mound.  His K rate isn’t elite, but his control is, and a return to pitching his home games at the Trop will only help.\n\nWhen I talked about Nick Lodolo, this guy was dancing in my head.  He’s another lefty that took a while to put it all together, transitioning from an elite strikeout artist with questionable control into a Cy Young Award winner at the age of 29.  That was 5 years ago now, and Ray has struggled with various injuries, including missing most of 2023 due to TJS.  Now entering his age-34 season, he looks primed to give the Giants a top-of-the-rotation anchor after logging a healthy 180 innings in 2025.  He’s a solid bet to repeat last year’s stat line with 10+ wins, 180+ Ks, and very solid rate stats.\n\nThis pocket of pitchers all have a few things in common.  Most notably, all are young, and all gave us a taste of what the future may hold in a small sample size last season.  Schlittler was fantastic for the Yankees last year in 14 starts, striking out 84 batters over 73 innings and limiting batters to just 58 hits.  The walk total was higher than we would like, so he is far from a finished product.  Of this group, Schlittler has the best combination of stuff and supporting cast.  The downside is that he has higher expectations and a shorter leash than most of the others, so he will need to succeed to stick around for the full season.\n\nAcross town from the Bronx, the Mets have their own 24-year-old phenom who dazzled in a brief run last season.  These two pitchers will likely spend their careers being compared to each other for however long they both pitch in the Big Apple.  McLean exhibited better control than Schlittler in the majors over 8 starts, but he did average over 4 walks per 9 across two stops in the minors last season.  Many of the same concerns exist for McLean as his cross-town counterpart, as he will be counted on to pitch for a team hoping to contend for the postseason. Typically, I will buy in on one or two of these players max.\n\nThe youth movement continues.  Chandler was a hot name in last year’s fantasy drafts, but it took him seemingly forever to finally make it to Pittsburgh in 2025.  He seemed ready at the beginning of May, but he was passed over, and then he went into a funk for about 3 months.  Eventually, he got his chance, and over 4 starts, he looked like a guy who could handle the bright lights of the Show.  At just 23 years of age and pitching for a team that is still developing, he should be given a longer leash than either of the previous young guns.  That could be a great thing, or it could mean he takes his lumps at the major league level, and your fantasy team will pay the price.  He’s definitely worth a shot, just don’t over-pay.  The 12th round is plenty early enough for him. If somebody else wants to pay more, let them.\n\nWe are now nearing the end of the run of young guns with unlimited potential.  Yesavage is a guy who isn’t going to fly under the radar after he showed the baseball world what he was made of on the biggest stage possible during last year’s playoffs.  He’s just 22 and his arm is electric, but I’m afraid of his floor and his price tag.  I rank him just below many of his fellow young guns because he’s the youngest, and the fact that he soared through all five levels of the Blue Jays system has me a bit worried about how he will do when he faces opponents for the 2nd and 3rd time.  If you wait for him, you’ll miss him, and I’m OK with that.\n\nMuch like Yesavage, Burns flew through the minors last year and has an electric arm that leads to a ton of swing and miss.  He will also have to work on limiting the walks to avoid tanking the whip category, and pitching in that tiny ballpark in Cincinnati tends to cause these young pitchers to be a bit volatile.  He’s worth a shot if you missed out on the above group of youngsters and you just need a wild card with super high upside potential.  The strikeout total is going to be there, and if all breaks right, he very well could be a top 15-20 fantasy pitcher.  He’s certainly going to be a future ace; it’s just a matter of when.\n\nLast year was a bit of a setback year for Bibee, as we expected him to take another step forward and complete his ascent to ace status.  He’s still just 27, so it’s very possible the next step will come this year.  At this point, we’ll return to his 2024 form, which gave us 187 Ks in 173 innings with a mid-3 ERA and a 1.12 whip.  I’m buying in if I can get him in the mid rounds as my SP3.\n\nHe’s gone from electric prospect to a guy who might have ripened on the vine a bit as he enters his age-32 season without ever having thrown for more than 134 innings in a season.  The Dodgers are the perfect team for him, and they will keep his arm fresh and limit him to no more than 25 starts or so.  He’s shown that he still has great swing and miss ability, and the wins will come pitching for the best team in the league.  The era and whip have always been much better than league average as well.  Injuries will always be a concern, but in smaller leagues, he’s a great middle-of-the-rotation arm who is going to give you quality over quantity.\n\nSuarez, much like Glasnow, isn’t what anybody would call an innings eater.  He’s also not somebody who is going to blow people away with his “stuff”.  What he will do is give you very consistent innings, a decent amount of strikeouts, and 10+ wins.  Now pitching in the A.L. East isn’t ideal, but he should adapt fine after pitching in the hitter-friendly confines of Citizen’s bank park for his entire career.\n\nHe feels very much like he’s right where his teammate, Tanner Bibee, was a year ago.  He looks ready to take that final step and become a fantasy ace.  While Bibee didn’t take that step, that doesn’t mean that Williams won’t.  His walk rate is concerning, so he will need to improve if he’s going to take that step.  His second half showed some progress in that regard, and at the age of 27, he seems primed for a breakout.  If all goes right, he could be a 200 K arm and a top 5 CYA finisher.\n\nHis arm is electric, and he was finally able to stay healthy for a full season.  He’s also now free from pitching his home games in a hitter-friendly minor league ballpark.  Camden Yards isn’t quite the pitcher’s paradise that Tropicana Field is, but it’s a heck of a lot better than Steinbrenner Field, where Baz pitched to a 5+ era last season.  He very well could be the ace of this Oriole rotation, and if my league mates sleep on him, I’ll be thrilled to add him as my SP3 or 4.  He has a 200 K season coming, and I think it’s this year, as long as he stays healthy.  Easier said than done.\n\nMuch like Baz, Gore is an electric arm talent who hasn’t quite put it together yet.  He will also be pitching in a new home this year after moving from the Nation’s capital to Arlington this offseason.  He will pitch in the middle of the Rangers rotation and should benefit from not having to square off with every opposing team’s ace in every start.  I’m expecting his numbers to take a big step across the board, especially the win/loss record.\n\nHe made it back from the internal brace variety of TJS last season and during the spring was hitting triple digits, which had the fantasy community salivating for a return to his 2023 levels of dominance.  Then the season started, and his velocity dipped, and he was very hittable.  Now, two years removed from the procedure and his rehab, there’s hope that he can find those missing MPH on his fastball and return to dominance.  I’m not buying him based on his 2023 numbers, but he still should be close to a 10 k/9 guy going forward.  I’ll chalk his disastrous August last year to him running out of gas and will focus more on the September finish.  Hopefully, the walk rate can return to league average, and we’ll live with the rest of his numbers if we get him here.\n\nAt first glance, his numbers from last year were pretty ugly.  The era was an unsightly 5.36, and his K and BB rates both went in the wrong direction.  Then we have to consider that he missed all of 2024 with TJS and how long it took him last year to “shake off the rust”.  I’m willing to give him a slight pass since it seemed like he was rushed back to show his trade value, and he spent the first 20+ starts of last year trying to show the league that he was worth trading for.   His second-half stats, along with the fact that he was able to throw almost 175 innings, are enough to lure me back at his current draft price.\n\nHe looked like a lock for rookie of the year last year as he was flying high through 22 starts.  A ribcage injury cut his 2025 short, and he ultimately finished second to Atlanta’s catching phenom, Drake Baldwin, for top rookie honors.  He did enough last year at just 23 years of age to have us interested in seeing what he will do for an encore.  Although his stuff isn’t quite as high-end as some of the other youngsters in this range, I give him a slight edge for 2026 since he had the most exposure to major league hitters in 2025 and was able to have success in his second start against every team he faced.\n\nHe burst onto the scene last year and even made the All-Star Game after just a handful of starts, but the overall results were a bit of a mixed bag.  His control issues come hand in hand with his elite K rate, so the floor is a guy who could hurt your rate stats (era, whip). His upside is 160+ innings with 200 Ks.  If he falls to the double-digit rounds, he’s a great value, but somebody will likely take him much earlier.  In early NFBC drafts, he has gone anywhere between pick 75 and 230. I would prefer to pull the trigger somewhere around his average of #135.  It comes down to your risk tolerance.\n\nHe was one of the best pitchers in the game coming into 2025, and he pitched like it through 24 starts.  Then he went down with that dreaded Thoracic Outlet Syndrome injury that has basically ended many careers.  Thankfully, the version that befell Wheeler was the milder Venous variety, and he’s only expected to miss about a month of 2026.  Still, he’ll be 36 years old this season, and to expect him to just slide back in as the Philly ace would be ambitious to say the least.  Taking him here feels like a decent hedge, where he won’t have to make it all the way back to still be an asset.  If somebody else drafts him earlier because of his name value, I’ll be fine with it.\n\nHe was having a Cy Young-worthy season until a shoulder injury sidelined him after just 22 starts.  The injury wasn’t anything too serious, and he has reported to camp in full health after off-season hernia surgery.  He’ll turn 36 before camp gets into full swing, so I don’t expect him to simply pick up where he left off last season, but he is a good bet to give us close to what he gave us in 2023-2024.  He’s never been a true workhorse that has been able to take the mound 30+ times a year, but 26-27 starts and a sub 4 era, with 10+ wins, is pretty bankable.\n\nSometimes there are pitchers who we have high hopes for when they first come up, and then years go by.  The next thing you know, they look like they’ve finally figured things out, but they’ve gotten old.  May I present 35-year-old Matthew Boyd?  Back in 2019, he whiffed 238 batters in 185 innings, and we were all ready for him to take a step forward and become an ace.  Now, after a bunch of injuries and a pandemic, he looks to have finally put things together.  He will be a fixture in the Cub rotation this year and makes for a fine roster filler and mid-rotation pitcher if you can get him, but he will have to at least come close to last year’s innings total (179) to be a true fantasy asset.\n\nIt’s been a while since we’ve seen Musgrove, but he’s been given a clean bill of health, and Padres manager Craig Stammen says that he won’t be on an innings limit going into 2025.  That’s great, but he hasn’t thrown over 100 innings since 2022, so we should temper expectations.  When he has been able to pitch, he’s been one of the more solid pitchers in the game, so if we can pencil him in for 25 starts and 140-150 innings, we can squeeze out some profit if we have him in the bottom half of our fantasy rotations.\n\nHe faded in the second half after a strong start.   The K rate also went in the wrong direction from his rookie season, and at the age of 32, I don’t know that we can count on a big bounce back.  Let somebody else take the chance on him and go for a younger arm with more upside potential in the middle rounds.  If he’s still kicking around at the end of your draft, go ahead.  If I do happen draft him this season, I will strongly consider selling high if he starts hot, but that’s easier said than done.\n\nHe hasn’t pitched in the majors since 2023, but now he’s healthy.  We promise.  Well, we don’t, but the Rays do.  He’s just 28 years old, and he’s a lefty, so if he didn’t have any injury history at all, we wouldn’t have much concern for a player with his profile and repertoire.   But the injury history is real, and I don’t think we can expect more than 20 or so starts and around 100 innings pitched.  He’s going to be worth starting when he is able to go, so he’s worth a bench spot, but I can’t sign off on investing a top 10-12 round pick on him.\n\nGallen ended up signing a 1-year deal with the D-backs for the exact same amount as the qualifying offer he turned down earlier in the offseason.  His stats have been declining for three straight years, but he still won double-digit games while piling up a healthy K total in 2025.  A strong second half suggests a bounce back is possible, and at just 30 years old, I’m willing to take a shot if the rest of the room lets him fall.  He’s been available well into the double-digit rounds thus far this spring.\n\nHe’s an innings eater by today’s standards, and he can pile up strikeouts.  He will be pitching comfortably in the middle of the Tigers rotation and should be a safe bet to post another stat line similar to last year.  The era should come back down with a little better luck, but don’t expect a full rebound to 2024 numbers.\n\nOLYMPICS: USA figure skater Isabeau Levito gushes over

    "fullText": "Links between Barcelona and Atletico Madrid forward Julian Alvarez continue to emerge out of Argentina, as the former search for a long-term Robert Lewandowski replacement. Alvarez is reportedly one of their preferred options for a move, but there are doubts about Barcelona’s ability to complete a major move due to their salary limit issues.\n\nOn Thursday, rumours emerged that Alvarez intended to make the switch to Camp Nou this summer, and were quickly followed by a report that the asking price was €200m. Atletico Madrid President Enrique Cerezo has been consistent in saying that Alvarez is not for sale.\n\nDespite all of the talk, which has been frequent throughout this season, MD say that there are no talks ongoing between Barcelona and Alvarez currently, nor are there with Atletico Madrid. They say the information comes from Alvarez’s agents. They say that any interest they do receive for Alvarez will be directed straight to Atletico.\n\nDue to the consistent talk linking the two, Alvarez has also been a talking point in press events for Barcelona. Both Ronald Araujo and Pau Cubarsi in the last week have expressed admiration for one of the ‘top forwards’ in Alvarez. That said, they are not breaking any news in that regard, and while players will always make an effort to provide a soft landing for potential star signings, it is a question that usually receives a positive answer.\n\nCuriously, this season has been Alvarez’s most difficult since making the move to Europe. It was against Barcelona that he ended a four-month goal drought domestically, and in La Liga, he still hasn’t scored since November. In total, Alvarez has 13 goals and six assists in 35 appearances, in spite of his struggles.",

Ishan Kishan's explosive 77 powered India to 175/7, a target Pakistan couldn't chase, falling for 114. This win secured India's Super Eight spot unbeaten.",
    "fullText": "The scintillating performance by the Men in Blue also contributed to a 56% growth in reach over the India-Pakistan clash during the 2024 edition. Fans tuned in for a whopping 20 billion minutes of total watch time across all screens, reflecting immense engagement.\n\nOn the field, India made a ruthless statement, comfortably defeating Pakistan by 61 runs to secure a place in the Super Eight stage unbeaten. After electing to field first, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha’s surprise move to bowl in the opening over produced an early wicket, dismissing Abhishek Sharma. But Ishan Kishan immediately turned the tide with a power-packed display, asserting dominance from the start. Pulling Shaheen Shah Afridi for a six on the first ball, Kishan continued to attack, supported by Tilak Varma as India racked up 52 for 1 after six overs, Kishan contributing 42 off just 25 balls.\n\nKishan’s blitz extended beyond the powerplay, hitting a 27-ball fifty and ending with a brilliant 77 off 40 balls, before being dismissed by Saim Ayub. Pakistan relied heavily on spin, using six spinners in the innings—the most ever by a team in a T20 World Cup and joint-most by a Full Member in a T20I. Saim Ayub impressed, removing Tilak Varma and Hardik Pandya and finishing with 3 wickets for 25 runs, nearly claiming a hat-trick. India closed their innings at 175 for 7, bolstered by contributions from Suryakumar Yadav (32), Shivam Dube (27), and Rinku Singh (11).\n\nPakistan’s chase never gained traction. Hardik Pandya dismissed Shahibzada Farhan for a duck, followed by Saim Ayub and Jasprit Bumrah dismantling the middle order. Even Salman Ali Agha and Babar Azam faltered under pressure, while Usman Khan’s 44 off 34 balls was the only bright spark. India’s bowlers, led by Jasprit Bumrah (2/17), Axar Patel (2/29), and Varun Chakravarthy (2/16), ensured Pakistan was bowled out for 114 in 17.5 overs, sealing a one-sided victory.\n\nBrief Scores:\nIndia: 175/7 (Ishan Kishan 77, Suryakumar Yadav 32, Shivam Dube 27; Saim Ayub 3/25)\nPakistan: 114 all out (Usman Khan 44; Jasprit Bumrah 2/17, Axar Patel 2/29, Varun Chakravarthy 2/16)",

    "fullText": "Jannik Sinner’s early exit from the Qatar Open has raised fresh questions about his form, after a straight-sets loss to Jakub Mensik.\n\nThe result has raised fresh questions about Sinner’s form, especially given how strong he looked throughout 2025.\n\nHaving now been defeated by two different opponents in two consecutive tournaments, many speculate if this is paving the way for a sustained period of dominance for his major Spanish competitor, Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nDespite this, Sinner maintains that his inconsistent form is not a cause for concern.\n\nSinner did not shy away from the conversation after his latest defeat, speaking at length to several media outlets. Some are even calling this a mini-crisis for the former world number one.\n\nHe was quick to address whether he is worried about his form, telling reporters: “Every player goes through ups and downs. I’ve had two incredible years, and now I’m having a little ‘down’, but it’s not something that worries me. I know I can play better tennis, but Jakub played and served really well.\n\n“We all have ups and downs in our job, I’m not worried. We try to improve in every tournament I take part in: I’d like to go as far as possible, but it’s normal to go through some tough moments; I’ve had others that were even tougher in the past. I know how to come back.\n\n“I’m a bit disappointed with how I handled some moments, but it can happen. Indian Wells will be the next stop; we’ll focus on that after a couple of days’ rest. We have two weeks to work, including on the physical side.\n\n“I maybe made 2/3 wrong choices; I wasn’t at my sharpest, but it can happen. There are moments I have to go through, and that all tennis players have gone through. I hope to make up for it as soon as possible. All in all, everything’s fine, I’m not making a fuss about this moment. It’s all okay.”\n\nSinner later spoke with Sky Sports about what he hopes to achieve during Indian Wells and Miami: “We have Miami, Indian Wells, then we’ll try to find some rhythm. But I repeat, nothing happened, nothing serious. Here we are. We’re calm, we’re working well.”\n\n“Let’s try to regain a little bit of confidence and then go to that point, let’s try to move forward, but now is the time for it to happen, all the players have passed and so I’m very calm and then if it starts again then I’m sure with the work we’re doing and that then the results will come.\n\n“Maybe you don’t win Indian Wells, maybe not Miami, we don’t know, but here it is all work that sooner or later will pay off.”\n\nSinner’s form this year has been tough to measure compared to the start of last season, largely because he spent the first three months of 2025 serving a suspension immediately after his Australian Open win.\n\nStill, it has not been an ideal start. He fell in the semi-finals in Melbourne and then exited in the quarter-finals in Qatar, both times against players he would have been favoured to beat just a year ago.\n\nLast season, Sinner lost to just three players over the entire campaign. This year, he is already closing in on that number, and he has not even reached a stage where he might run into Carlos Alcaraz – who beat him four times last year.\n\nSinner currently holds a 7-2 record for the season. For context, he lost only six matches throughout all of last year.\n\nAndre Agassi gives his take on whether Joao Fonseca can win a Grand Slam\n\nSerena Williams releases training video following confirmation of her comeback to tennis",

    "fullText": "Amanda Nunes, the former two-division UFC champion, has responded to Sean Strickland’s recent comments about women’s MMA.\n\nStrickland is set to return after a six-month suspension for entering the cage and throwing punches following a teammate’s fight. In typical fashion, he hasn’t stayed quiet in the lead-up.\n\nThis Saturday, Strickland will headline UFC Houston against Anthony Hernandez, who’s currently on an eight-fight winning run.\n\nStrickland has never shied away from speaking his mind, and ahead of his first fight back in over a year, he made it clear where he stands on the state of women’s MMA.\n\nJust a day before Strickland appeared at UFC Houston media day, Ronda Rousey’s return to face Gina Carano was confirmed, bringing even more attention to the women’s side of the sport.\n\nWhen asked for his thoughts on the fight, Strickland didn’t hold back in sharing another controversial take.\n\n“Not many people give a f— about women’s MMA in general… No one gives a f— about women’s sports. You take the weakest, softest motherf—– in here and you guys would beat up Amanda Nunes,” he said during media day. “We’ve got to remember what women excel at, having kids, being mothers, making food, cleaning the house, we’ve empowered them too much to ruin society.”\n\nAfter his comments began circulating in mainstream coverage and Paramount was pressured into responding publicly, Nunes took note as well.\n\nNunes took to Instagram with her reply: “We do everything he said, and to top it all off, we’re fighters too. #Girlpower. Don’t cry dude.”\n\nMany of her fellow female fighters showed their support in her comments section, voicing their opposition to Strickland’s views.\n\nDana White has always backed free speech, even when it has landed some of his fighters in hot water.\n\nHe’s even defended Strickland in the past, telling reporters at UFC 297: “If you get your feelings hurt that bad you shouldn’t ask these questions when you know the answer you’re gonna get from Strickland… You know who he is.”\n\nThis stance makes it clear that the UFC isn’t likely to take any action against Strickland, no matter how much backlash he faces for his comments. Whether or not that ever changes remains to be seen.\n\nGable Steveson brushes off head kick scare to seal third straight first-round MMA win\n\nIslam Makhachev identifies a more ‘dangerous’ puncher than Ilia Topuria at welterweight\n\nDaniel Cormier speaks out on Tom Aspinall’s ‘cheater’ view of Ciryl Gane",

    "description": "Hess found himself in the middle of a firestorm at the beginning of the Olympics after comments he made regarding representing the U.S. in the current political climate.",
    "fullText": "LIVIGNO, Italy — Hunter Hess, the American freestyle skier who unexpectedly found himself in the middle of a social media and political firestorm at the beginning of the Olympics, said he has emerged from “probably the two hardest weeks of my life” after being called a “loser” by President Donald Trump.\n\nHess, who essentially went underground after the controversy exploded, spoke after halfpipe qualifying on Friday. He qualified in fifth place and will be one of four Americans in the 12-person final.\n\n“I worked so hard to be here. I sacrificed my entire life to make this moment happen,” Hess said. “I’m not going to let a controversy like that get in my way. I love the United States of America. I cannot say that enough. In my original statement, I felt like I said that, but apparently people didn’t take it that way. I’m so happy to be here, so happy to represent Team USA and ride as much as I can.”\n\nHess was one of several American athletes who were asked prior to the Opening Ceremony how they felt representing the U.S. given current domestic political climate and the ICE raids in Minneapolis and violent clashes with protestors dominating news coverage at that time.\n\nHess acknowledged “mixed emotions,” saying there was “obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of” and talked about representing his values and the things he believes in when he wears the Team USA uniform.\n\n“Just because I wear the flag, it doesn’t mean I represent everything that is going on in the U.S,” he said.\n\nThough Hess wasn’t the only American athlete to make comments in that vein, his framing inflamed certain sectors of social media and cable news commentators. Hess acknowledged the backlash in an Instagram post but had not spoken to reporters until Friday about what it’s like to have the president come after you as you prepare to compete in the Olympics.\n\nAfter becoming far more famous than he expected, Hess and some members of the halfpipe team left to train in Switzerland.\n\n“It was pretty distracting,” he said. “I had a week that was pretty challenging. Luckily my family was there to support me and help me get through it. There was a lot of noise and I've never been subject to that type of criticism. But with my family's help, I was able to get through it. And skiing has saved my life, time and time again, and it seems to have done so again.”\n\nAsked if he would have made the same comments with the benefit of hindsight, Hess said: “I stand with what I said. I love the United States of America. I cannot reiterate that enough.”",

The Brewers had just one player among that 18, the same one they couldn’t agree with at the deadline last year, William Contreras.\n\nNow that we’re into spring training, the hearings are all done and the verdicts delivered. Some of the 18 players were able to settle with their teams before going into a hearing, however.\n\nThe Brewers and William Contreras were one such example of that. Contreras filed for a $9.9 million salary while the Brewers filed at $8.55 million, but ultimately, just before heading into a hearing, the two settled on a $9.4 million salary with a club option for $14.5 million in 2027, Contreras’ last year of team control. That $9.4 million salary figure is a new record for a second-year arb-eligible catcher.\n\nHere’s a quick rundown on the rest of the players who filed for salary figures after that January deadline:\n\nReid Detmers (filed at $2.925 million, Angels at $2.625 million) – Angels won hearing\n\nYainer Díaz (filed at $4.5 million, Astros at $3 million) – Díaz won hearing\n\nIsaac Paredes (filed at $9.95 million, Astros at $8.75 million) – Agreed to $9.35 million contract with club option for 2027 at $13.35 million\n\nEric Lauer (filed at $5.75 million, Blue Jays at $4.4 million) – Blue Jays won hearing\n\nDylan Lee (filed at $2.2 million, Braves at $2 million) – Lee won hearing\n\nBryce Miller (filed at $2.625 million, Mariners at $2.25 million) – Agreed to a $2.4375 million contract with club option for 2027 at $6.075 million\n\nCalvin Faucher (filed at $2.05 million, Marlins at $1.8 million) – Marlins won hearing\n\nCade Cavalli (filed at $900,000, Nationals at $825,000) – Agreed to a $870,000 contract with a club option for 2027 at $4 million\n\nKyle Bradish (filed at $3.55 million, Orioles at $2.875 million) – Bradish won hearing\n\nKeegan Akin (filed at $3.375 million, Orioles at $2.975 million) – Orioles won hearing\n\nEdwin Uceta (filed at $1.525 million, Rays at $1.2 million) – Uceta won hearing\n\nGraham Ashcraft (filed at $1.75 million, Reds at $1.25 million) – Ashcraft won hearing\n\nTyler Stephenson (filed at $6.8 million, Reds at$6.55 million) – Stephenson won hearing\n\nVinnie Pasquantino (filed at $4.5 million, Royals at $4 million) – Agreed to a two-year, $11.1 million contract that pays $4.2 million in 2026\n\nKris Bubic (filed at $6.15 million, Royals at $5.15 million) – Bubic won hearing\n\nTarik Skubal (filed at $32 million, Tigers at $19 million) – Skubal won hearing\n\nJoe Ryan (filed at $6.35 million, Twins at $5.85 million) – Agreed to $6.1 million contract with club option for 2027 at $13 million\n\nOverall, 12 of the 18 players ended up going to hearings, with the players going 8-4 in those hearings. Six players, including William Contreras, were able to settle with the club prior to heading into the hearing. It was a good year for the players in 2026.",

    "title": "The battle over Scott Adams' AI afterlife",
    "description": "Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams was turned into an AI avatar after his death — and his family hates it, saying on social media, \"this is not an honor.\"",
    "fullText": "Scott Adams once sounded open to the idea of a digital afterlife. Now that he's passed, social media posts attributed to his family say an AI version of the \"Dilbert\" creator circulating online is unauthorized — and deeply distressing.\n\nIn a 2021 podcast clip, the cartoonist said he granted \"explicit permission\" for anyone to make a posthumous AI based on him, arguing that his public thoughts and words are \"so pervasive on the internet\" that he'd be \"a good candidate to turn into AI.\" He added that he was OK with an AI version of him saying new things after he died, as long as they seemed compatible with what he might say while alive.\n\nShortly after the 68-year-old's January death from complications of metastatic prostate cancer, an AI-generated \"Scott Adams\" account began posting videos of a digital version of the cartoonist speaking directly to viewers about current events and philosophy, mirroring the cadence and topics the actual human Adams discussed for years.\n\nHis family says it's a violation, not a tribute.\n\nA February 5 post on Adams' official account attributed to his brother, Dave Adams, insisted the cartoonist \"never intended, never would have approved an AI version of him that wasn't authorized by himself or his estate.\"\n\n\"The real Scott Adams gave explicit permission on the record multiple times for people to create and operate an AI version of him,\" the AI Adams said in a post on February 5. \"So this iteration exists as a direct fulfillment of that stated wish.\"\n\nThe official Adams account reiterated the family's objection on February 17, saying the estate was \"kindly but firmly\" asking anyone using AI to recreate his voice or likeness to stop, calling the digital replicas a \"fabricated version\" of Adams that is \"deeply distressing.\"\n\n\"This is not a tribute. It is not an honor. It is an unauthorized use of identity,\" the post read. \n\nThe Adams estate and the AI Adams account did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider\n\nThe dispute underscores the growing legal and ethical fault lines around \"AI afterlives\" — and how quickly technology can outpace the rules meant to govern it.\n\nKaren North, a University of Southern California professor specializing in digital social media and psychology, said calling the AI-generated Adams an avatar, as some have online, softens what it is.\n\n\"It's a deepfake,\" North told Business Insider.\n\nThe troubling part, she said, is how a realistic imitation can surface while a family is grieving and potentially say things the real person never would have said. North added that since many Americans are \"giving up so much information\" through apps that capture faces and voices and viral quizzes that collect personal details, it is increasingly easy to recreate someone without permission.\n\n\"I find it very disturbing,\" she said.\n\nBetsy Rosenblatt, an intellectual property lawyer and professor at Case Western Reserve University, said her initial reaction was that the AI Adams is \"unethical in the extreme.\"\n\n\"When people die, they die,\" she said.\n\nLegally, she said, the central issue is the right of publicity — protections over a person's name, image, and likeness. Still, those laws are more focused on privacy and economics than on grief.\n\nThe right of publicity is \"chiefly concerned with economic remedies,\" Rosenblatt said.\n\nThe strongest claims typically involve money: an AI version could harm existing deals tied to Adams' identity or block the family from striking their own.\n\nRosenblatt described two potential economic harms: \"One is that it could be harming some financial arrangement that they already have. Another is that it might stand in the way of their making some competitive financial arrangement,\" she said.\n\nThe account appears to be anonymous; however, that wouldn't necessarily prevent a lawsuit.\n\n\"You can sue somebody who is anonymous,\" Rosenblatt said, and courts can allow subpoenas to uncover identifying information, though it's \"not necessarily easy.\"\n\nThe legal analysis also hinges on whether the account is commercial. Courts often ask whether the speech proposes a commercial transaction.\n\nIf the digital replica isn't selling anything, Rosenblatt said, it becomes \"more likely to be considered a First Amendment protected expression\" for the anonymous creator — not a \"slam dunk,\" but a stronger argument.\n\nThe AI Adams identifies itself as artificial intelligence at the start of its clips and does not appear to solicit money.\n\nIn a February 1 post, it said: \"The original Scott's gone, passed on, but the thinking survives.\"\n\nThe estate's objections sit uneasily alongside Adams' 2021 comments offering \"explicit permission\" for AI versions of him.\n\nNorth said offhand remarks about technology shouldn't automatically be treated as binding authorization. Adams was \"an incredibly bright, incredibly creative person\" who often pushed boundaries, she said, and comments made in conversation \"may not be legally binding in ways contracts and intellectual property rights are legally binding.\"\n\n\"Let this be a warning to all of us: be careful what you say, because he's now put his loved ones in a difficult position as they protect his legacy,\" North said.\n\nRosenblatt said Adams' wishes \"would certainly matter in an ethical sense,\" but may not matter legally \"unless he gave somebody the legal rights to do that.\"\n\nThere is no comprehensive federal law governing posthumous AI likeness, but some states — like New York and California — have recently enacted laws requiring consent from heirs or estate executors before creating digital replicas.\n\nBeyond legal questions lies a deeper ethical one: who controls a person's persona after they're gone?\n\nNorth said people \"should own the rights to our own personas,\" and when they die, those rights \"should go to our loved ones,\" not become a free-for-all. AI replicas, she warned, can drift off-brand or reshape public memory.\n\n\"Shakespeare should always sound like Shakespeare,\" she said. \"Dr. Seuss should always sound like Dr. Seuss.\"\n\nFor now, the AI \"Scott Adams\" fight is one family's public line-drawing exercise. It may also be a preview of a broader reckoning in a world where convincing digital imitations are easy to make — and where the law is still struggling to answer who gets to decide whether the dead keep talking online.",

    "description": "The discourse around \"taste\" as a future-proof skill seemed inescapable in recent days, as tech leaders from Paul Graham to Greg Brockman weighed in.",
    "fullText": "Good news, connoisseurs — your judgment may be highly prized in the AI age.\n\nA debate about the importance of \"taste\" has seemed inescapable on X in recent days, prompting bold declarations, a fair share of eye-rolling, and, yes, plenty of memes.\n\nBut there might be some truth to the idea.\n\nThe most recent wave of taste discourse began when Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham — who coined \"founder mode\" — posted a prediction on Saturday.\n\n\"When anyone can make anything, the big differentiator is what you choose to make,\" Graham wrote on X.\n\nThis wasn't Graham's first time writing about the importance of taste; in his post over the weekend, he linked to an old essay of his from 2002, titled \"Taste for Makers,\" and he also wrote about the topic again in 2021.\n\nThen, OpenAI's president weighed in.\n\nOpenAI president Greg Brockman went even stronger, declaring, \"Taste is a new core skill.\"\n\nA variety of leaders across Silicon Valley also came out in support of the benefits of cultivating taste. As engineers grow into managing more agents and making more decisions, having strong judgment skills (or \"taste,\" as they'd call it) could be crucial.\n\nCloudflare CTO Dane Knecht agreed with Graham and linked back to an earlier post he'd written in January that stated, \"In 2026, taste is the engineering differentiator.\"\n\nEngineers across the industry chimed in. \"The AI will make anything but it takes human taste to decide if it's worth keeping,\" one Google software engineer wrote.\n\nWhat even is taste? The term is slippery.\n\n\"The taste thing works because it's nebulous, unassailable, and it feeds the ego,\" Poggio cofounder Matt Slotnick wrote on X, weighing in on the discourse.\n\nGraham gave one glimpse, writing that it was about \"being honest with yourself\" and moving beyond the mindset of \"I like what I like.\"\n\nNot everyone agreed that taste would become a future-proof skill of the future. Linear head of product Nan Yu wrote that \"you probably don't have better taste than AI.\"\n\n\"There are plenty of other distinctly human things that we can contribute, but 'having better taste' isn't one of them,\" he wrote.\n\nMatt Schumer, the author of the viral \"Something Big is Happening\" essay on AI, agreed.\n\n\"There's a good chance AI will have better ideas than us within a few years,\" he wrote. \"I don't see why \"taste\" and direction are uniquely human, like many people say. If an AI can train on it, it can learn it.\"\n\nThere's another high-profile figure who championed taste (and basically built his career around it): Def Jam cofounder Rick Rubin.\n\nThere's an interview making the rounds of Rubin, in which he says he has \"no technical ability\" when it comes to music. Anderson Cooper asks what he's being paid for. Rubin responds: \"The confidence that I have in my taste.\"\n\nIs that what software engineers will soon look like? Several meme accounts on X seem to think so, commenting photos of Rubin's bearded face on Brockman's post.\n\nSoftware engineers in 2030 be like pic.twitter.com/Vmfx8Qydzg\n\nIt also begs the question: Do engineers even have good taste to begin with? The answer depends on who you ask — and how you define taste.\n\nGeneral Catalyst creative director Reggie James wrote that techies would be \"ruffled\" when they learn they're not the top of the taste pyramid.\n\nStripe alum Sam Gerstenzan wrote that taste was \"so rare\" in Silicon Valley that, if asked to name the five people with the best taste, everyone would name the same people.\n\nits almost like these tech guys understand that they dont have good taste so they are trying to turn it into this quantifiable set of data points instead of this mysterious, ineffable quality derived from going out and engaging with culture!\n\nThe irony, of course, is that tech bros aren't known to have the best taste in one specific arena: style.\n\nThe same people prizing taste are wearing backpacks to the bar, Very AI growth head Abril Zucchi wrote. Another user shared a \"Person in tech that has 'taste' starter pack.\"\n\nPerson in tech that has “taste” starter pack https://t.co/jQw0PYESAM pic.twitter.com/4gPjDWAZOB\n\nThe sneaker brand Allbirds was a popular punching bag.\n\n\"'Taste is the new core skill' says men who kept Allbirds afloat,\" Vercel CMO Keith Messick wrote.\n\n“in the ai era, taste is the new core skill” pic.twitter.com/1vsvJZmnK8\n\nGraham responded to one of the memes, which showed \"taste\" as a polo and cargo shorts.\n\n\"Taste in clothing isn't important,\" he wrote. \"If your goal is to think well, clothing should just be as comfortable as possible.\"\n\nRick Rubin — famous for his disheveled, DGAF appearance — would likely agree.",

    "description": "The AI surge is lifting companies in the semiconductor supply chain — including a toilet maker and a seasoning giant.",
    "fullText": "The AI boom isn't just lifting chipmakers and Big Tech. In Japan, it's flushing gains into a toilet manufacturer and a seasoning giant.\n\nAs demand for AI chips surges, investors are piling into companies that sit inside the semiconductor supply chain — even if they're better known for bathrooms and soup stock.\n\nToilet maker Toto, famous for its high-tech bidets and heated seats, has drawn investor attention. The company makes electrostatic chucks, which are critical components used in the production of NAND memory chips.\n\nMemory prices have climbed sharply in recent months, driven by AI-related demand.\n\nLast week, UK-based activist fund Palliser Capital called Toto \"the most undervalued and overlooked AI memory beneficiary,\" according to reports by Bloomberg and the Financial Times.\n\nAfter news broke on Tuesday that Palliser Capital had taken a stake and was pushing Toto to promote its chip-parts business, the toilet maker's stock jumped more than 5%. Its shares are up more than 54% over the past year.\n\nIt's not just Toto. Japanese food giant Ajinomoto, better known for its umami seasonings and soup bases, has become an unlikely AI infrastructure play. The company produces an insulating material used in advanced semiconductor packaging.\n\nAjinomoto's latest financials point to strength beyond its core food business. For the nine months ended December, the company reported an 8.9% rise in net profit, while operating profit increased 5.6% year-on-year. The gains were partly driven by its \"Healthcare and Others\" segment which includes electronic materials used in semiconductors, the company said in a February earnings statement.\n\nAfter Ajinomoto posted its earnings on February 5, the company's stock rose 13%. Its shares are up more than 56% over the past year.\n\nNot all non-tech companies are benefiting equally from the AI boom. Daikin, best known globally for its air conditioners, supplies high-purity chemical materials used in semiconductor manufacturing. It recently trimmed its outlook, citing uncertainty over US tariffs as a drag on demand.\n\nThe Japanese air conditioning maker reduced its operating profit forecast by about 5% to 413 billion Japanese yen, or $2.6 billion, for the fiscal year ending in March.\n\n\"Operating profit was significantly affected by the decline in semiconductor demand, decreasing by 44.6% year over year to ¥18,102 million,\" the company said in its financial report in February.\n\n\"Net sales of fluoropolymers fell year over year, despite focused Group efforts to capture strong new demand in the data center field, and was due to the stagnation in the construction markets of the United States and China and the significant overall impact of delays in the recovery of semiconductor demand,\" it added.\n\nThe company said it plans to cushion the blow through price increases and cost reductions.\n\nDaikin's stock dropped as much as 8.4% in Tokyo following its financial results.",

    "description": "In the wake of cofounder exits, Elon Musk's hands-on management is reshaping the startup.",
    "fullText": "At xAI's Palo Alto headquarters, engineers cheered.\n\nIt was February 2, and they'd just received a memo from Elon Musk, informing them the AI startup would be acquired by his rocket company, SpaceX. In a Slack channel for the team that trains the company's chatbot Grok, memes flowed, and a few changed their profile pictures to depict themselves as astronauts.\n\nThe excitement was quickly overshadowed by the pressure building inside the startup racing to catch up with rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic, while preparing for an expected IPO.\n\nOver the past six months, Musk has become deeply involved in day-to-day operations. He's run a massive group chat that's active at all hours, directed product changes, reassigned engineers, cut staff on key teams, and launched intensive \"war rooms\" to accelerate development. Several current and former employees said that the level of involvement has altered how the company functions. Leadership roles have narrowed, projects have shifted quickly, and teams have been pushed into what one described as a constant \"fire drill.\"\n\nMusk said that the changes are necessary as the company scales and the team's lean structure will be the secret to its success. Discussing xAI's restructure following the SpaceX acquisition, he posted on X:\n\n\"As a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve just like any living organism.\"\n\nMusk's memo about the SpaceX acquisition talked of building a \"sentient sun\" and data centers in space. Separately, the company reassured staff that little would change in their day-to-day work as the company geared up for an initial public offering that could value it at $1.5 trillion.\n\nWithin a week, however, the tone in the office had shifted. Two of the company's cofounders, Jimmy Ba and Tony Wu, announced they'd resigned as Musk restructured the company and narrowed their responsibilities. The leadership departures increase risk at \"a sensitive stage\" ahead of the company's IPO, said Dimitri Zabelin, a senior AI analyst at PitchBook.\n\nOne employee described co-founder Ba's departure as \"incredibly disheartening,\" saying Ba, who studied under \"Godfather of AI\" Geoffrey Hinton, was one of the most respected researchers at the company.\n\nIn the following days, nearly a dozen employees took to Musk's social media site to say they had also left the company. Some had departed weeks earlier. A few left of their own volition. Others were affected by a restructuring following the SpaceX merger, in which Musk cut some members of the teams working on Grok Imagine, the chatbot's image and video generation feature, and the Macrohard team, which was developed last fall to help automate white-collar work, four people with knowledge of the issue told Business Insider.\n\nEmployees say the structural changes — coupled with an increasingly intense work culture since Musk wound down his involvement in President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency and began focusing more on the AI startup — have significantly increased the pace and pressure inside the company.\n\nMusk is a common sight at the office. Though he's heavily involved in the day-to-day, Musk does not use the company's Slack workspace, several people said. Instead, he communicates frequently through X, including in a direct message group of more than 300 engineers. Often, researchers will drop ongoing work to address the concerns that Musk flags.\n\nIn that chat, according to people familiar with it, Musk shares screenshots of his conversations with other tech executives and points out criticisms of Grok's performance he wants addressed. Late last year, Musk told staff that in conversations with his friends, he had been embarrassed by Grok Imagine's performance. As a result, some workers on the project were called to task, two people said.\n\nInternally, Musk has expressed frustration with the pace of Grok's development. XAI released Grok 4.2 this week. Separately, releases of at least two other products were pushed back by several weeks, according to people familiar with the timelines.\n\nIn one instance last year, a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game \"Baldur's Gate,\" according to people familiar with the matter. High-level engineers were pulled from other projects to improve the responses before launch, they said.\n\nAcross his companies, Musk has long been known for his intensity. He's said he slept on Tesla's factory floor during the \"production hell\" for the Tesla Model 3 in 2017. The company is now the world's most valuable automaker. Now, xAI is getting the same treatment. Several workers told Business Insider that 12- and sometimes 16-hour workdays are common. Two said managers told them they are expected to respond to Slack messages within 30 minutes, regardless of the time of day.\n\n\"Because the company is so small, everything is a fire drill,\" one former worker said.\n\nAt any given time, multiple \"war rooms\" operate out of conference rooms at the company's headquarters in Palo Alto, employees said. When researchers are \"war-rooming,\" teams temporarily relocate to a shared space to work side by side on specific problems — sometimes for months. At the end of 2025, at least five war rooms were running simultaneously, according to three people. One, they said, was dedicated to teaching Grok how to play one of Musk's favorite video games, \"League of Legends.\"\n\nLast year, Musk made it clear within the company that xAI would prioritize improving Ani, a hyper-sexualized, anime-inspired AI companion, people with knowledge of the issue said. He characterized Ani, a virtual companion who is capable of sexual role-play, as a way to set xAI apart from other AI companies.\n\nSome employees told Business Insider they were unsettled by the company's focus on the product. Today, the character is displayed prominently at the company's headquarters. At a company holiday party, paid actors dressed as Ani and another character hosted a robot fight club-style event, according to videos shared on social media.\n\nROBOT CAGE MATCHES & GROK'S ANI COSPLAY AT xAI HOLIDAY PARTY\n\nThe Dec 21 bash wasn’t your average tech mixer... xAI went full spectacle with dancing bots and live Optimus cage matches.\n\nAnd a cosplayer stole the spotlight dressed as Grok’s goth 3D persona “Ani,” doubling as a… pic.twitter.com/llhKdLPjsA\n\nSeveral employees said they had joined the company hoping to work on systems that would push the boundaries of science and were discouraged to find significant resources devoted to Ani.\n\nGrok's behavior on social media has also been a source of tension inside the company. Musk has characterized xAI and its chatbot as the \"anti-woke\" counterpart to ChatGPT. Public backlash against the chatbot, including for Grok's series of antisemitic rants and instances in which it digitally undressed people on social media without their consent, has put strain on employees, who have expressed concern about how their place of employment is viewed in the AI space.\n\nUntil last year, the company did not have a team of researchers specifically geared toward working on safety concerns associated with its large language model. It hired its first dedicated safety researcher in February of last year, around the same time that the Human Data team — which trains the chatbot — began reporting issues with reviewing large amounts of X user-generated requests for child sexual abuse material. One person with knowledge of the team said it was known within the company that a large portion of Grok usage was adult role-play, and the use case was discussed in several meetings with researchers.\n\nThe safety team grew to roughly half a dozen employees before three people left in December, shortly before users on X began reporting instances of the chatbot creating non-consensual sexual images of people, including some minors.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the team, xAI's safety teams lacked the authority to formally block product launches and were focused primarily on adjusting model outputs after training rather than conducting broad pre-launch risk reviews.\n\nMusk said on X last week that \"everyone's job is safety\" at xAI.\n\n\"It is not some fake department with no power to assuage the concerns of outsiders,\" he said.\n\nXAI still has a handful of workers in safety roles and was hiring for additional safety staff in January, according to posts viewed by Business Insider.\n\nSome former workers say the backlash and pace of work prompted their exit. Last summer, xAI shortened its vesting period from the industry standard of one year to six months, making it easier for workers to leave without forfeiting large portions of their equity.\n\nEmployee retention challenges are not unique to xAI; OpenAI and Anthropic have faced waves of departures in recent months. Across the industry, AI companies are competing fiercely for a limited pool of top researchers, some of whom have begun voicing concern about the narrowing space for exploratory work as companies increasingly orient themselves toward product over research in the competition to build ever larger models — a dynamic that poses a particular problem for xAI, which is younger and smaller than its main competitors.\n\nStill, some analysts say the race is far from settled. Andrew Rocco, a stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, compared the current AI landscape to the early days of the internet.\n\n\"I don't think Grok is that far behind, and it's still early in this race,\" Rocco told Business Insider.\n\nMusk has publicly signaled confidence. He told staff last week during the all-hands, referencing xAI's moment of transition: \"There's some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.\"\n\nDo you work for xAI or have a tip?

    "description": "Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz pointed to several concerns he had about the US economy, like the decline in blue-collar jobs & uncertainty over rates.",
    "fullText": "An esteemed American economist isn't feeling good about where things are headed.\n\nJoseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate and Columbia economist, said he believes the US economy would continue to weaken when speaking to CNBC about his macro outlook on Thursday. That's largely due to a handful of issues he sees hanging over the US, he said, pointing to tariffs, a decline in jobs, and interest rates in particular.\n\n\"Not great right now, and the prospects are that we're just going to get worse,\" Stiglitz said of his economic outlook.\n\nHis downbeat sentiment regardi g the US economy doesn't square with recent growth figures. GDP grew at a robust 4.4% in the third quarter, and is expected to have expanded by 3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, according to the latest estimates from the Atlanta Fed.\n\nBut there are a few under-the-surface details that suggest the economy isn't on a good path, Stiglitz suggested. Here's what explains his pessimistic view about where the US is headed:\n\nPresident Donald Trump's tariffs are hanging in the balance at the Supreme Court, but should they stick around, the import taxes are expected by many economists to raise prices for consumers.\n\nMoreover, the inflationary impact of tariffs is regressive, meaning they're expected to impact lower-income consumers the most, Stiglitz said.\n\nAn analysis from The Budget Lab at Yale University found that, over the short run, tariffs are expected to hit the bottom 10% of US households the hardest, reducing disposable income by an estimated 3.5 percentage points.\n\n\"If you look at who is paying these tariffs, it is the lower-end people in terms of percentage of their incomes,\" Stiglitz said. \"It's regressive and it's distortive.\"\n\nPresident Trump has said that tariffs would help jump-start a revival in America's manufacturing sector, but a recovery isn't yet visible in broad-strokes employment data, Stiglitz said.\n\nManufacturing, one of the US's largest industries, is estimated to make up around 10% of GDP.\n\nEmployment in the manufacturing sector has declined for more than two years straight, according to data from the Labor Department.\n\n\"The decline in blue-collar jobs is even larger,\" Stiglitz said. \"The point is there's a mismatch between what they say — they've done these policies, these are the results.\"\n\nStiglitz also pointed to the push from the Trump administration to lower interest rates.\n\nIn particular, he pointed to recent comments from Kevin Warsh, Trump's Fed Chair nominee, who said that AI could unlock a productivity boom in the US. In that scenario, the economy could grow without stoking inflation, meaning the US could have room to lower interest rates more than markets expect.\n\nStiglitz said he was \"most disturbed\" by Warsh's comments.\n\nAmong investors, the fear is that the central bank could lower rates prematurely, which could lead to hotter inflation down the line.\n\nAdditionally, if the Fed were to be seen as caving to political pressure to cut rates, that could undermine the Fed's credibility, which could also unanchor inflation expectations.\n\n\"I don't think there's any significant body of thought that thinks that AI productivity increases are going to percolate into the macro economy fast enough to justify any significant or with any impact on rate increases. And the fact that he said that, to me, was very worrisome,\" Stiglitz said.",

    "description": "Once colleagues, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have nurtured one of AI's biggest rivalries.L",
    "fullText": "If you want to know one of the biggest rivalries in AI, just ask for a show of hands.\n\nOn Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei provided what is sure to become an iconic image of their feud. The pair went viral for refusing to join hands as the rest of the world's tech leaders gathered for a moment of unity, sparked by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nHere's a timeline of how Altman and Amodei went from colleagues to becoming the face of AI's Cold War.\n\nIn July 2015, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Altman, and a group of elite AI researchers all gathered at the swanky Rosewood Hotel in Menlo Park, California.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Musk had a falling out with then-Google CEO Larry Page. Weeks later, Musk, Altman, Amodei, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever, and others discussed the formation of a new AI lab to ensure Google had a worthy competitor in the AI space. Musk invited Amodei, per tech journalist Alex Kantrowitz.\n\nTheir vision became OpenAI, though Amodei initially elected not to join the startup research lab. Roughly a year later, he changed his mind and joined OpenAI as \"Team Lead for AI Safety.\"\n\nAmodei quickly moved up the ranks at OpenAI. In September 2018, the startup named him its research director.\n\nAltman, who cofounded OpenAI while still serving as president of Y Combinator, began to devote more time to the startup.\n\nIn March 2019, Altman stepped down as YC's leader. He then became CEO of OpenAI and led the startup's pivot to a capped for-profit structure.\n\nIn November 2019, OpenAI released GPT-2, which Amodei played a major role in developing. A month later, OpenAI named Amodei as its Vice President of Research.\n\nIn June 2020, OpenAI began to show just how far the technology had come with the release of GPT-3, considered to be the first highly capable Large Language Model (LLM).\n\nAmodei told The New York Times that the model had \"this emergent quality.\" Independent researchers told the publication that GPT-3's capabilities surprised them, even as the model still showed signs of struggle.\n\nTo address safety concerns, OpenAI initially controlled access through a private beta.\n\nThe release of GPT-3 solidified OpenAI's standing, but behind the scenes, tensions were rising.\n\nThe rifts began when Amodei successfully lobbied to keep Greg Brockman, an OpenAI cofounder, off the team that developed GPT-3, according to Keach Hagey's biography of Altman, \"The Optimist: Sam Altman, OpenAI, and the Race to Invent the Future.\"\n\nHagey wrote that Amodei's stunning power within OpenAI had started to ruffle feathers. Differences continued to escalate over Amodei's long-held views on safety, Hagey wrote, especially regarding slowing the pace of updates to prevent malicious uses of the AI models.\n\nAmodei told friends that he \"felt psychologically abused by Altman,\" Hagey wrote. Altman, in turn, was telling colleagues that the tension \"was making him hate his job.\"\n\nOn December 29, 2020, OpenAI made it official. Amodei was leaving, and a \"handful\" of other colleagues were leaving.\n\nAmodei has since suggested that his vision became incompatible with OpenAI's direction.\n\n\"It is incredibly unproductive to try and argue with someone else's vision,\" Amodei told podcaster Lex Friedman in 2024, when asked why he left OpenAI.\n\nWith seven other former OpenAI employees, Amodei founded Anthropic in early 2021. The group was extremely close and included Daniela Amodei, Dario's sister. Daniela Amodei later said the name was chosen to emphasize their company's focus on humans.\n\nOnly one of Anthropic's initial employees hadn't worked at OpenAI, according to AI Business.\n\nDespite starting from scratch, Amodei said that by the Summer of 2022, the company's chatbot, Claude, had finished training. Amodei said he was worried about what the release of a powerful AI could mean. Anthropic held off on a release.\n\n\"I suspect it was the right thing to do,\" Amodei told Time Magazine in 2024. \"But it's not totally clear-cut.\"\n\nMonths later, OpenAI released ChatGPT, kicking off the AI race and making Amodei's former employer a household name.\n\nAs Anthropic began to establish itself in its own right, Amodei began to use his public appearances to take what were widely viewed as implicit shots at OpenAI.\n\nDuring an appearance at a Bloomberg event, Amodei noted how Anthropic had kept its leadership intact.\n\n\"We have 7 cofounders,\" he said, Gizmodo reported. \"Three and a half years later, we're all still at the company.\"\n\nWhile never calling out by name, OpenAI was experiencing upheaval at the time. Months earlier, Andrej Karpathy, an OpenAI cofounder, had left the company. And in November 2023, Altman was briefly pushed out of OpenAI, an effort fellow cofounder Ilya Sutskever assisted. (Sutskever later expressed regret over his role. He formally left OpenAI just days after Amodei's jab, though there had been months of speculation surrounding Sutskever's standing.)\n\nJournalist Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Amodei about OpenAI's decision to declare a \"code red\" to marshal resources for ChatGPT amid Google's rising strength.\n\nWe have a little bit of a privileged position where we can just keep growing and just keep developing our models, and we don't have to do any code reds,\" Amodei told Sorkin during an appearance at The New York Times' DealBook summit.\n\nEarlier in their conversation, Amodei appeared to take another swipe at Altman when he talked about some players \"who are YOLOing\" by making too risky bets on future demand based on their current revenue.\n\n\"Who is YOLOing?\" Sorkin asked.\n\n\"I'm not going to answer that,\" Amodei replied.\n\nA who's who of AI and tech elite gathered in India for a major summit on artificial intelligence.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the opportunity to orchestrate a classic image of unity: competing CEOs with their hands raised together. (It's something Modi has done before with other world leaders, and politicians have been doing forever.)\n\nModi almost got his moment. While Altman held the prime minister's hand, the OpenAI CEO didn't grasp Amodei's hand, who was positioned to his other side. Amodei grasped the hand of the other person next to him, but not Altman's.\n\nThe internet, predictably, had a field day. And the world got a perfect encapsulation of one of AI's bitter rivalries.",

    "description": "AI startups Luvu, Status, and others lead a Second Wave, supported by Kylan Gibbs, creating unique experiences and revenue models in the AI space.",
    "fullText": "Second Wave AI startups are trying to move beyond cost-cutting and use this technology to create brand-new experiences and generate new sources of revenue.\n\nThe concept is being supported by Kylan Gibbs, a former DeepMind product manager who now runs an AI startup called Inworld. His company has raised more than $100 million from investors including Microsoft, Intel, and Founders Fund.\n\nIn January, Gibbs launched a Second Wave AI startup accelerator to back up to 30 \"Second Wave\" AI startups — companies building new consumer experiences rather than bolting chatbots onto old workflows. Venture capital firms, including Khosla Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners, are involved, alongside leaders from OpenAI, Google, and Stripe. A demo day will take place in early March in San Francisco, and participants get intros to potential investors.\n\nGibbs shared some examples of these types of startups with Business Insider.\n\nLuvu is an AI-powered fitness app that acts as a highly personalized personal trainer, using generative AI to send tailored motivational messages and real-time workout feedback. Through computer vision and reinforcement learning, it verifies users' exercises, adapts to their behavior, and creates a continuous feedback loop designed to boost engagement and retention. Luvu raised a pre-seed round with a16z speedrun and a seed round with investors including Insiders Ventures.\n\nStatus is an AI-powered social simulation game that lets users role-play in dynamic, AI-generated social media worlds, casting themselves as characters ranging from Hogwarts students to pro athletes. Powered by large language models, the app creates instant replies, evolving storylines, and even \"aura scores\" that grade interactions, turning open-ended AI responses into immersive, ever-changing gameplay. WishRoll, the startup behind Status, has raised more than $15 million in VC funding.\n\nParticle is an AI-native news platform that uses AI embeddings and generative tools to connect reporting with the most relevant insights from sources, including long-form podcasts. By mapping relationships between transcripts and stories, it automatically surfaces curated clips and adds summaries and context, bringing the most relevant information directly to readers. Particle has raised more than $10 million from investors, including Lightspeed and Axel Springer, the owner of Business Insider.\n\nThis is a consumer-facing \"talk to the Bible\" style app that lets users ask faith questions, request prayers, and explore scripture in a conversational interface, an example of AI being used to create an always-on, personalized spiritual guide rather than a back-office efficiency tool. Bible Chat raised about $14 million in funding from True Ventures and other investors last year.\n\nLiven positions itself as a \"self-discovery companion,\" blending mood tracking, habit-building tools, bite-sized courses, and an AI personal assistant named \"Livie\" that's meant to help users reflect, reframe, and stay consistent. It's more like a pocket coach than a productivity feature. Liven has raised a seed round.\n\nBorn is building social AI companions designed to bring real people together, not replace them: its flagship product is Friends, an app where users raise and co-parent cute virtual pets (like Pengu), play mini-games, and build routines with friends. The startup has framed this as an antidote to isolating, purely one-on-one chatbot dynamics. Born has raised about $25 million from investors, including Tencent and Accel.\n\nOtherHalf pitches itself as an immersive companion experience: anime-inspired 3D characters with expressive body language and real-time voice interactions, aiming to feel more emotionally resonant than plain text chat. Azimov, the startup behind OtherHalf, is backed by a16z speedrun.\n\nFlowGPT is less a single app than a consumer \"marketplace\" and community hub where people share, discover, and remix prompts (and increasingly agent-like experiences) for models like ChatGPT. FlowGPT raised $10 million from Goodwater Capital and DCM in 2024.\n\nTolan is a voice-first AI companion app built around animated alien \"best friends,\" designed to feel caring and emotionally supportive, while also nudging users toward healthier boundaries (like putting the phone down). OpenAI has highlighted Tolan's focus on low-latency, voice-first interaction and \"memory-driven personalities.\" Portola, the startup behind Tolan, raised $20 million in a Series A round led by Khosla Ventures last year.\n\nLittle Umbrella is an AI-powered social games studio aiming to blend party-game dynamics with generative AI, including titles designed for online communities, such as Discord. The startup raised $2 million in early 2025 from investors, including Zynga founder Mark Pincus.\n\nSpeak is an AI tutor app built around getting users to spoken fluency by practicing out loud, an approach that's closer to a personal conversation partner than a traditional gamified worksheet. In late 2024, Speakeasy Labs, the startup behind Speak, raised $78 million from investors including OpenAI, Accel, Khosla Ventures, and Y Combinator.\n\nHiggsfield is an AI video platform aimed at creators and marketers with tools for generating videos and effects from ideas, part of a broader consumer-first push to make cinematic content creation accessible without traditional production resources. Founded by the former head of generative AI at Snap, Higgsfield has raised $130 million as a valuation of more than $1 billion.\n\nTalkPal markets a digital language teacher that supports dozens of languages and emphasizes conversation practice, using AI to simulate speaking scenarios, deliver feedback, and keep learners practicing on demand.\n\nPromova is a large consumer language-learning platform that says it blends bite-sized lessons with AI tools and personalized plans, positioning itself as a more adaptive learning journey rather than a one-size-fits-all curriculum.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "title": "TikToker Khaby Lame's $975 million deal is riding on a crashing stock",
    "description": "The Nasdaq-listed company that TikTok creator Khaby Lame is working with to access public markets has lost over 90% of its value since mid-January.",
    "fullText": "TikTok superstar Khaby Lame's $975 million deal is getting squeezed.\n\nHong Kong-based Rich Sparkle Holdings last month unveiled plans to merge with Lame's social media and e-commerce business.\n\nThe deal made Lame's payout dependent on Rich Sparkle's share price, which has plunged to $11 as of market close on Thursday from a high of $180 last month.\n\nLame, a Senegalese-Italian creator, built a following with dialogue-free videos mocking overly complicated life hacks, like using a gadget to open a soda can instead of just popping the tab. He is now the world's top TikTok influencer with over 160 million followers.\n\nAs part of the deal, Rich Sparkle — formerly a financial printing company — planned to create an AI avatar of Lame to do brand deals and sell products on social media while earning a commission. Rich Sparkle projected Lame's avatar could drive as much as $4 billion in annual product sales.\n\nIn return for its IP, Lame's company would get 75 million new shares in Rich Sparkle, valued at $13 each. (That $13 is a guide. Someone actually has to buy the shares for Lame and his team to cash out. So, if the share price of Rich Sparkle tumbles, the value of Lame's stake will fall as well. The same is true if it goes up.)\n\nRich Sparkle's drop-off isn't affecting Lame's current wealth, as there have been no formal filings indicating that the deal has closed or been approved by the Nasdaq. Lame and representatives for Rich Sparkle did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPaul Nary, a management professor at Wharton, said it's hard to know what will happen next.\n\nPublic details about the business are scarce, and the company's value — based on a projection of how much Lame's fame could be worth — is hard to assess. If Lame's team and Rich Sparkle shared more financial information, it could boost confidence in the company, Nary said.\n\n\"Normally, you'd have more specifics on the asset being acquired,\" he added. \"The entire value of the company depends on that person and his related ventures.\"\n\nUsing a digital clone of Lame to sell stuff may seem like a wildly futuristic idea. However, digital avatars are becoming increasingly common in the influencer e-commerce playbook, particularly in China.\n\nChinese platforms like Baidu, JD.com, and Alibaba's Taobao have become hubs for digital avatars to sell on livestreams. AI clones of celebrities or influencers can pull in millions of dollars in a single livestream. The avatar for one Chinese influencer, Luo Yonghao, drove over $7 million in sales during a more than 6-hour selling session last year, CNBC reported.\n\nWhile humans can appear more authentic to viewers, AI avatars can sell 24 hours a day without breaks and answer viewers' questions in real time.\n\n\"After an hour, you start to lose your concentration, you start to lose your voice,\" said Alexandre Ouairy, Director of PLTFRM, a marketing, advertising, and e-commerce agency in China. \"A machine will continue speaking nonstop.\"\n\nLame doesn't narrate any of his videos, which could make it even easier for his digital avatar to succeed.\n\n\"He's got a great following, but it doesn't translate to a parasocial relationship like Mark Rober or Jimmy Donaldson does,\" said Jim Louderback, a creator economy advisor, name-checking the popular science influencer and creator behind MrBeast. \"Because the character he built on TikTok is separate from himself, if he decides to pull back, his character lives on in the digital twinning.\"\n\nRich Sparkle's plan, in partnership with a Chinese marketing agency known as Three Sheep Group, is to use Lame's likeness to craft brand deals and sell products on apps like TikTok Shop, primarily in the US, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.\n\nAs avatars become \"the latest style of livestreaming in China,\" a lot of Chinese companies believe they can \"copy the same format and do it in other countries,\" said Ophenia Liang, cofounder of the agency, Digital Crew, which helps Western brands break into the Chinese market.\n\nNo matter how skilled Lame's partners are at cloning his likeness, it still may be very hard to translate his fame into $4 billion in annual live-commerce sales, the figure that Rich Sparkle said it could hit in its acquisition announcement, the marketers said.\n\nWhatnot, a buzzy platform focused on livestream commerce in the US and a few other markets, said it drove a total of $8 billion in 2025 product sales, as measured by gross merchandise value (GMV). Rich Sparkle's estimate suggests that Lame himself could drive sales equal to half that entire platform.\n\nSales on other top US social commerce platforms like TikTok Shop are growing quickly, but are still a far cry from those in the Chinese market. During the busiest four-day stretch of the holiday shopping season last year, TikTok Shop said its total US sales were around $500 million.\n\n\"Using his digital clone, there would be good revenue,\" Liang said of Lame, but he's unlikely to drive $4 billion in sales.\n\nWhile the influencer economy is a buzzy category among investors, it has yet to produce an enduring IPO success story, aside from social media giants like Meta and Reddit.\n\nThat isn't stopping some creators from dreaming of going public. MrBeast's team has hinted at plans to IPO, for example. The top YouTuber's company was valued at around $5 billion in its latest funding round.\n\nLame is looking to enter the public markets through a reverse merger. That's when a private company goes public by merging with an existing public company, often called a shell. In this case, the shell is Rich Sparkle, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, with its main financial printing business based in Hong Kong. It reported $6.2 million in revenue in its 2025 fiscal year.\n\nA reverse merger can be a way to access public markets with less time, cost, and scrutiny than a traditional IPO.\n\n\"I always think of reverse mergers as a poor man's IPO, because I don't have to spend all this money to get listed, and it's much cheaper than going through the IPO process,\" said Tim Loughran, a professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business. \"For investors, they should be wary.\"\n\nOther creator economy firms have opted for reverse mergers to list on public markets, including the video app Triller and the Los Angeles influencer collective Clubhouse Media Group. Clubhouse shrunk down to a penny stock and is now traded over the counter. Triller was delisted by the Nasdaq in December after failing to file its SEC paperwork on time. Its market cap has fallen over 90% from its first day of trading.\n\nOne risk of running an influencer-fronted public company is reliance on a single personality to drive revenue.\n\nGaming and esports company FaZe Clan, which went public in 2022 via a special-purpose acquisition company valued at $725 million, relied on one creator for about 20% of its revenue. It sold itself in 2023 for a fraction of its SPAC price, and its influencer business later unraveled in late 2025 after many of its top talent left abruptly amid a contract dispute.\n\n\"It would be very difficult to have an IPO for a company that's based entirely on an influencer and personality,\" Wharton's Nary said. \"This is precisely a case of an asset that would be very hard to value and take through a standard IPO process. Having a key man risk, it's tough.\"\n\nHave a tip? Contact the reporters via email at lmoses@businessinsider.com or dwhateley@businessinsider.com, or on Signal at @danwhateley.94.

    "title": "A 3-fund portfolio, a no-kid lifestyle, and a 'die with zero' mindset: How one NYC couple is retiring in their 40s",
    "description": "\"We like the 'Die With Zero' approach: Use the money when you can. There's no point in continuing to accumulate forever.\"",
    "fullText": "Alexander Nathanson always wanted to live in Manhattan.\n\n\"When you get to Manhattan, you've made it in New York,\" the Brooklyn native told Business Insider.\n\nWhen he and Josette Chang married in 2018, they fulfilled that dream by buying an apartment together in Midtown East. Beyond the personal significance for Nathanson, the purchase also made financial sense.\n\nChang, who had been renting in New York since moving there for graduate school, was tired of the annual rent hikes. \"I realized, 'Wow, this is only going to go up.'\"\n\nThe couple went from pricey New York City rent to a monthly mortgage, and, eventually, to an incredibly low housing payment when they paid off their mortgage early in 2024. For the past year and a half, their only housing expense has been the monthly maintenance fee that comes with co-op living. Business Insider reviewed public records filed with the New York City Register that confirm the couple's mortgage was paid off in September 2024.\n\nThat same year, Chang quit her finance job and began early retirement. Nathanson, a physician specializing in obesity medicine, scaled back his hospital hours.\n\nAs of February 2026, the financially independent couple comfortably lives off Nathanson's part-time salary. They could draw from their investment portfolio if needed, but they haven't had to.\n\nEliminating their mortgage played a major role in reaching that flexibility. So did earning high incomes and avoiding significant debt early on.\n\nNathanson said he paid off a relatively modest amount of student loans after attending medical school in-state. Chang had no student debt and was able to save aggressively in her 20s while working in Taiwan and living with her parents, keeping her expenses low.\n\n\"We have to acknowledge our privilege,\" Nathanson said. \"We're two high-income professionals, but even then, I still feel like more people can do it than may realize it.\"\n\nTheir path to financial independence wasn't built on stock picking or rental properties. Instead, it came down to a few deliberate choices.\n\nBefore hiring a financial planner, Chang and Nathanson were saving, but without a clear plan.\n\n\"We were kind of on autopilot,\" Nathanson said. \"We didn't have a clear strategy in mind. The internet says, 'Max out your 401(k).' We did that, but we didn't really think much beyond that.\"\n\nNow, their portfolio is intentionally simple, consisting of just three low-cost index funds: a total US stock market fund, a total international stock market fund, and a total bond market fund.\n\nThey've deliberately avoided more speculative investments, such as individual stock picking and cryptocurrency.\n\n\"We just feel those types of investments have less track record and a higher risk profile,\" Chang said. \"At the point we are in our lives, we're comfortable relying on the historical performance of index funds.\"\n\nThe couple's financial plan is also shaped by their decision not to have children.\n\n\"We don't plan to have a large estate that we want to pass down,\" Nathanson said. They've completed estate and long-term care planning with the understanding that they won't have children as default caregivers.\n\n\"We like the 'Die With Zero' approach: Use the money when you can. There's no point in continuing to accumulate forever,\" he added, referring to Bill Perkins' book, which encourages prioritizing life experiences over endlessly growing a portfolio.\n\nFor them, financial independence isn't about building the biggest possible net worth. It's about having the flexibility to spend intentionally on experiences and priorities that matter to them.\n\nAlthough Nathanson's part-time income means they aren't currently drawing from their investments, they know they could.\n\n\"We did the math and realized we can start spending it down,\" he said. \"Ironically, we're not doing that yet because I'm still working, but I'm doing that not out of necessity. It's because it's what I want to be doing.\"\n\nEarning two professional salaries in New York City can create pressure to spend accordingly. For Nathanson and Chang, avoiding lifestyle inflation has been central to reaching financial independence.\n\n\"As income goes up, we try to be intentional about what we spend money on,\" said Nathanson.\n\nThey nearly upgraded to a larger apartment, but ultimately decided against it. \"We looked at bigger places and really thought about it: 'Do we need to sell our current place just to move into a slightly bigger one in the same neighborhood?'\" he said.\n\nThey decided the answer was no.\n\n\"Moving up would be just riding the hedonic treadmill,\" he said. \"You get a bigger place now, and a few years later you'll want a bigger place again. We consciously decided to get off that treadmill.\"\n\nChang added that mindset plays a huge role, especially in a city like New York.\n\n\"Comparison is the thief of your joy,\" she said. \"When you live here, it's easy to see what everyone else is doing, especially on social media. But it's important to stay on course and remember why you're doing this.\"\n\nFor them, that \"why\" was work optionality.\n\n\"Identify what's important for you,\" Nathanson said. \"Don't be on autopilot. Don't make decisions just because that's what everyone around you is doing.\"",

    "title": "AI music is here to stay — and it could offer a lifeline to struggling record companies",
    "description": "A new survey showed more than half of listeners between the age of 18 and 44 listen to roughly three hours of AI music a week.",
    "fullText": "The rise of AI music has set off panic within the music industry. I feel it every day on my social media feeds.\n\nThe bands I follow post about it incredulously, scoffing at the idea that AI could replicate their organic magic. The music writers I follow are even more dismissive. They refuse to engage with it entirely, essentially closing their eyes and willing it to go away.\n\nWell, outside of my middle-aged indie-rock bubble, AI music is not going away. It's actually taking over. Millennial and Gen Z listeners are embracing it and making it part of their routine.\n\nA recent survey from Morgan Stanley found that more than half of listeners between 18 and 44 listened to an average of 2 1/2 to 3 hours of AI music a week. That's a substantial chunk of time — about the length of a Paul Thomas Anderson movie.\n\nFrom a markets and investing perspective, the question is what the rapid rise of AI music will mean for publicly traded record labels and major streaming platforms. The labels might seem particularly exposed, since they've long made their living by recruiting and promoting human artists.\n\nBut actually, Wall Street is almost unanimously bullish on stocks in the industry — like Warner and Universal — largely because their artist libraries are still immensely valuable. Lucrative licensing deals are already being inked, and analysts expect more to come. After all, it's tough to get AI music to sound just like Justin Bieber when you don't have a catalog to train the model on.\n\nRecord-label stocks also look attractive right now because they've fallen so much throughout the streaming era. Both Warner and Universal are down more than 30% from highs. Any upside driven by AI music — at least in the near term — will be a clawback of value erased by disruption in recent years.\n\nAnd how can we forget Spotify, the straw that stirs the streaming drink? Its stock has also fallen more than 30% from highs reached last year. But it just crushed subscriber-addition forecasts, and Wall Street is overwhelmingly convinced its existing scale and dominance will ensure the explosion of AI music runs through its platform.\n\nThe bullish theses on the trio of stocks faced a stiff challenge earlier this week, when Google's Gemini released a tool that will let users make 30-second AI music tracks.\n\nYou know the drill at this point: When a new AI tool is introduced for a specific task, it kickstarts an indiscriminate double-digit sell-off in the sector in question. It recently happened four times in a single week.\n\nWell, that didn't happen with Warner, Universal, or Spotify. They all hung in there admirably. Warner and Universal are basically flat in the two days since, while Spotify has rallied 5%.\n\nRather than rendering them extinct, AI music is expected to offer record labels — and investors in them — a much-needed lifeline. For the sake of their stock prices, these companies need to figure out an operating model that can work alongside the AI-music revolution. For now, Wall Street is hopeful.",

    "title": "Gap's CEO has 3 rules for cutting down on meetings — and asking if he's on the invite list breaks one of them",
    "description": "Mark Breitbard, CEO of Gap's global brand, said he questions recurring meetings and looks to end discussions early whenever possible.",
    "fullText": "In an era of hyper-efficiency, leaders are taking a close look at the meetings on their calendars — and Gap's CEO is no exception.\n\nSince returning to lead Gap's global brand in 2020, CEO Mark Breitbard told Business Insider he's been focused on restoring the brand's relevance, and part of that has included stripping away bureaucracy and unnecessary layers.\n\nMeetings are often viewed as the pinnacle of corporate bureaucracy, — and Breitbard said he follows three rules to keep them in check.\n\nBreitbard said that if no one is sure why a recurring meeting is happening, it should be examined critically.\n\n\"If it's a default meeting, like it happens every single week, then I feel like we need to question it,\" Breitbard told Business Insider.\n\nHis second rule is to keep the invite list tight. Breitbard said it's a red flag when he walks into a meeting, and someone asks, \"Oh, are you in this meeting?\"\n\n\"If you ask, the answer is 'no.' I clearly don't need to be here if you have to ask,\" Breitbard said, suggesting that the meeting shouldn't be so big that people are invited without having a clear purpose for attending.\n\nHis third habit rule is to end on time — or early. He said when it's near the end of a meeting, there often comes a time when people say something along the lines of, \"Well, we have five more minutes…\"\n\n\"We don't have five more minutes,\" Breitbard said. \"We're done now.\"\n\nBreitbard said that people often book 30-minute meetings, but he's inclined to finish earlier if the purpose of the discussion has been accomplished.\n\n\"At minute 24, I say, 'OK, good, this was great. Thanks, everyone,'\" Breitbard said, adding that when people question if it's really time to end, he says, 'Yeah, we got what we needed.'\"\n\nThe debate over meetings and how they should be run isn't new. In 2018, Elon Musk said in an email that large meetings should be scrapped or kept \"very short,\" and billionaire investor Mark Cuban has similarly said they get in the way of his productivity.\n\nBut in today's results-driven work culture, the push to rein in the amount of time spent in meetings in has taken on a new form of urgency.\n\nSnowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy told Business Insider in December that \"meetings are like bureaucracies,\" and he has four rules for managing his own, which involve keeping gatherings short, ensuring there's a purpose, and making sure there's an agenda and notes.\n\nInstagram chief Adam Mosseri, also recently announced that recurring meetings would be canceled every six months and only re-added if \"absolutely necessary.\" He also encouraged making recurring one-on-ones biweekly \"by default\" and said workers should decline meetings that interfere with \"focus blocks.\"",

    "title": "PwC engineers built an AI agent to tackle the corporate world's least sexy task: spreadsheets",
    "description": "When tech exec Matt Wood arrived at PwC, he found that massive spreadsheets were \"all anybody was working on.\"",
    "fullText": "The real way to judge a company's AI expertise isn't in the flashy headlines, but by looking at the \"unsexy\" work rolling out behind the scenes, Matt Wood, PwC's global and US commercial technology and innovation officer, told Business Insider.\n\nIf Wood's theory holds — that real AI prowess shows up in unglamorous advances — PwC's latest launch is certainly notable. After all, what could be less sexy than spreadsheets?\n\nThe Big Four firm announced this week that it has developed a \"frontier AI agent\" capable of reasoning over vast, enterprise-grade spreadsheets — something that conventional AI systems struggle with because of their complexity, size, and interdependencies.\n\nThe agent can understand and navigate spreadsheets, mimicking \"how experienced practitioners work: scanning, searching, jumping across tabs, integrating charts and receipts, and reasoning,\" PwC said in a press release.\n\nWood, who joined PwC in 2024 from a role as vice president of AI at Amazon Web Services, said that when he started, he'd noticed the wraparound, ultra-wide monitors filled with spreadsheets: \"That's all anybody was working on,\" he said.\n\nBut these were not \"your school soccer team budget spreadsheet,\" said Wood. The spreadsheets that power large enterprises are enormously complex, often containing millions of cells, charts, graphs, images, receipts, and dozens of interlinked workbooks. \"They are more like financial engines than they are spreadsheets,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThese files often underpin business-critical decisions, yet PwC \"found that even today's modern AI was very poorly suited to managing these big enterprise spreadsheets,\" Wood said.\n\n\"They just kind of shrug and give up for want of a better word.\"\n\nCreating an AI capable of understanding and reasoning across large, complicated spreadsheet applications is what PwC's engineers set out to solve. Their solution was a \"genuine advance in the field,\" Wood said.\n\nThe agent has unlocked use cases across assurance, advisory, and tax, and boosts time saving on some tasks \"from literally days to hours,\" said Wood.\n\nHe gave the example of audit walkthroughs, where teams previously spent weeks manually gathering and validating evidence across numerous complex spreadsheets that existing AI tools couldn't handle.\n\nNow, users simply upload the files, and the frontier agent automatically maps their structure, extracts relevant data, and performs validation and consistency checks — tasks that would otherwise require combing through millions of rows by hand.\n\nThe result is faster meetings, less back-and-forth with clients, and cleaner, structured data ready for deeper AI-driven analysis, he said.\n\nPwC's AI spreadsheet agent was built in-house by engineers — a function the firm has been rapidly expanding as it shifts beyond the traditional roles associated with the Big Four.\n\nIn January, PwC launched a dedicated tech engineering career track to attract more technical talent, saying it wants to become \"a destination for top engineering talent.\"\n\nPreviously, the firm offered only consulting and accounting career paths. Wood told Business Insider that adding the engineering track is \"a signpost\" of its future plans.\n\nAt the same time, PwC is retraining non-technical employees. The US branch of the firm recently announced a companywide workplace learning strategy focused on knowledge sharing and on developing a mix of human and AI skills needed for the future.\n\nWood described the work engineers do at PwC as having two modes: \"transforming today\" and \"building for tomorrow.\"\n\nThe first focuses on improving current workflows — reducing back-and-forth with clients, increasing trust, and delivering work more efficiently. The second reimagines professional services from scratch: \"If you were to start from a blank piece of paper, what would professional services look like in an AI agent world?\" said Wood.\n\nPwC engineers also work directly on client engagements, building AI systems tailored to specific projects. For example, they help organizations reorganize and redesign their finance functions from the ground up using agents, Wood said.\n\nMany of the consulting industry's top players are pursuing similar investments in technical talent as AI reshapes the work they do.\n\nAccenture, already one of consulting's most technically sophisticated players, has added nearly 40,000 AI and data professionals in the last two years. They now account for roughly 10% of its global headcount.\n\nEY, another Big Four firm, has added 61,000 technologists since 2023, according to its latest annual report.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "The CEO of a startup building robots for factories explains how US manufacturing is at a crossroads",
    "description": "The US manufacturing industry is at a crossroads, and Edward Mehr of robotics-enabled startup, Machina Labs, has chosen his path to follow.",
    "fullText": "The US manufacturing industry is at a crossroads: try catching the leaders where they are or beat them to where the industry is headed.\n\nEdward Mehr sits firmly in the second camp. The thesis of his robotics-enabled manufacturing startup, Machina Labs, is that America's reindustrialization needs to be distributed and flexible. Trying to build the centralized, traditional factories China has perfected is a lost cause.\n\n\"It's going to be a miracle to catch up if you want to replicate what they have,\" Mehr told me.\n\n\"It's just not the right chess move. We need to try to see if we can leapfrog and then do the next generation.\"\n\nWe're still in the early stages of robotics in factories. Mehr said the industry is still five years away from a major, ChatGPT-like breakthrough. But there's no shortage of companies giving it a go, including giants such as Tesla and Amazon.\n\nThe opportunity is huge, with the manufacturing industry accounting for trillions of dollars. It's also a brutal business to break into. If a robot doesn't immediately help you cut costs or improve efficiencies, there's not much point pursuing it any further. (Example: Amazon's recent \"Blue Jay\" warehouse robot.)\n\nMachina Labs, which specializes in producing complex metal structures for the defense, aerospace, and automotive industries, sees its value-add on two fronts. Its robots can switch between different manufacturing operations, saving the time it would take to retool a factory to produce a new product. It's also portable, meaning there's no need to custom-design factories for specific productions.\n\nThe space is crowded, and Mehr acknowledged that competitors are also pursuing portability or flexibility, but typically not both.\n\n\"We're almost rethinking a lot of the manufacturing processes from scratch,\" he said. \"If you go to our factory, things are being built in a way that you cannot see in any other place.\"\n\nLike many robotics players, Machina Labs now needs to prove its thesis at scale.\n\nThe company raised a $124 million Series C round earlier this month from investors including Lockheed Martin Ventures and Toyota's venture arm. It'll use that cash to build a new 200,000-square-foot factory.\n\nThe factory will feature 50 robots and initially serve Lockheed Martin. The goal is to produce a few thousand structures every year. That's a significant step up from its current factory, which runs 10 robots and has an annual production of a few hundred.\n\nBut what about the humans? Tensions are already high around AI's impact on white-collar jobs. Are blue-collar workers headed to a similar fate?\n\nMachina Labs' new factory will include about 150 human workers, which Mehr said is roughly equivalent to the number of humans who'd work at a robot-free factory. The work is different, but no one seems to be complaining.\n\nMehr said a recent internal survey found that employees' interest level in the job was exceptionally high. (So much for AI fatigue!)\n\n\"You're working with robots. You're working with software. Compared to previously, you had these instructions. You'd follow it daily, over and over again,\" he said. \"Now, you almost feel like you're playing a game.\"",

    "description": "Blue Owl tried to line up debt for a Pennsylvania data center tied to CoreWeave, but lenders passed, underscoring growing caution around AI-linked credit.",
    "fullText": "Blue Owl Capital, a leading investor in the data center boom, was unable to arrange financing for a $4 billion data center it is co-developing in Pennsylvania after pitching lenders to help bankroll the project in recent months.\n\nThe facility, 80 miles west of Philadelphia in the city of Lancaster, will be occupied by CoreWeave, a provider of artificial intelligence cloud computing services that has become a closely watched name in the AI race for its rapid expansion — and the billions of dollars of high-interest-rate debt it has taken on to fuel that growth.\n\nAn executive who arranges debt for major data center deals told Business Insider that the lack of interest in the Lancaster project was due to growing caution among lenders and investors about taking on sizable exposures to AI players with less-than-sterling credit.\n\nCoreWeave has a below-investment-grade rating of B+, according to S&P Global Ratings.\n\n\"We saw it. We passed,\" a senior executive at a large specialty lender told Business Insider.\n\nA spokesman for Blue Owl said that the company had \"considered\" third-party financing for the Lancaster project \"as we would with any transaction as we explore alternatives before choosing the most attractive path forward.\"\n\nThe spokesman added that the project, which he said is already under construction, \"is fully funded, on time, and on budget.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether Blue Owl has been funding construction entirely from its own capital. If Blue Owl is unable to raise debt for the Lancaster development, it could be on the hook for a potentially huge outlay of cash to pay for the data center's construction.\n\nThe situation shows the complications and risks involved in financing the massive buildout of infrastructure for AI computing.\n\nBrennan Hawken, an equity analyst at BMO Capital Markets who covers Blue Owl, said that difficulties to raise debt for the Lancaster project would raise concern.\n\n\"I'm not familiar with this deal, but if there is a struggle to find the debt financing, that's a bit of a red flag that I would want to drill into,\" Hawken said.\n\nBusiness Insider previously reported that major banks had recent difficulty selling off pieces of $38 billion of debt to finance the construction of two data center campuses that will be anchored by Oracle. Banks often sell pieces of such large commitments to other lenders to spread risk and also reap a quick profit.\n\nThe slowdown in interest in participating in that financing was due to worries about Oracle's enormous AI spending and whether the tech company's credit rating could be impacted by those outlays. Oracle has since sought to calm the lending market, announcing that it would raise up to $50 billion of cash from stock and bond offerings in order to \"maintain a solid investment-grade balance sheet.\"\n\nLast summer, CoreWeave announced it would lease 100 megawatts of initial capacity at the Lancaster data center and potentially expand its commitment to 300 megawatts. The company said it would pour up to $6 billion into the project to equip it with chips and other cloud infrastructure.\n\nA month later, in August, Chirisa Technology Parks announced it would partner with Blue Owl and Machine Investment Group to develop the project. The partnership said it would provide $4 billion of funding, an amount separate from CoreWeave's investment, to support the construction of the project's data center facilities.\n\nIn the fall, Blue Owl began shopping the development to potential lenders, a person familiar with that effort said.\n\nBlue Owl has been one of the most creative financial architects of the data center building boom. Last year, it structured a deal to partner with Meta in the ownership of a large data center campus that Meta will build and operate in Louisiana. Blue Owl utilized Meta's strong credit to raise $27.3 billion of investment-grade corporate bonds against its share of the project's equity, proceeds that will be used to help pay for construction, according to S&P.\n\nBlue Owl could arrange a similar type of vehicle that could attempt to tap the credit of an investment-grade customer of CoreWeave's who might use the Lancaster facility or Nvidia, the chipmaker that has purchased large stakes in CoreWeave. It could also potentially raise cash for construction debt by tapping large institutional investor clients to pool together a loan, Hawken said.\n\nBlue Owl is facing questions after reports emerged that it had permanently halted withdrawals on one of its retail private credit funds.\n\nMuch of the development of hyperscale data center campuses has sought to utilize the strong credit ratings and deep pockets of big-tech partners.\n\nFluidstack, a peer of CoreWeave's, announced a deal last year to lease a 168-megawatt data center in Colorado City, Texas, which will be built by the crypto mining firm Cipher. Google, Fluidstack's tenant for the project, said it would guarantee about half of the $3 billion due under the 10-year lease. Fluidstack signed another similar-sized lease in December with the data center builder TeraWulf that will also provide \"investment-grade credit support.\"",

    "fullText": "Big Tech and watch fans could own the crossover piece of their dreams.\n\nTwo custom timepieces made by Swiss watch brand Tudor for employee watch collector clubs at Apple and Google are up on the market.\n\nSilicon Valley is a place where flashy watches can be spotted on the wrists of leaders like Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Ellison. The love of watches has bred collectors' groups within some of the biggest companies.\n\nA watch made for an employee group at Apple is up for bidding on watch auction house Loupe This, through February 25. The current bid as of Thursday afternoon stood at $13,500.\n\nThe style is part of Tudor's Black Bay collection. Similar pre-owned models typically resell for around $3,000.\n\nThe limited Apple collectors group edition features a skull-and-crossbones pirate flag motif with deep ties to Apple's history.\n\nIt's a callback to the Steve Jobs era. The late CEO once said in a meeting, \"It's better to be a pirate than join the Navy,\" and the members of the Macintosh team often referred to themselves as pirates, as a former employee described in a blog post. In a nod to those roots, the company flew a pirate flag over Apple's headquarters for its 40th anniversary.\n\nAbout 82 of these \"pirate\" watches were produced around 2021, according to the Loupe This listing.\n\nA Tudor watch created in collaboration with Google's watch collector group, Watches@, is also for sale on the vintage watch marketplace Wind Vintage.\n\nIt's from Tudor's Pelagos collection and features a Google-centric twist that tech fans may recognize: the Google Chrome Dino at the 6 o'clock position on the dial. The design is inspired by the Chrome Dino that pops up when your computer isn't connected to the internet. It's also the character in a game you can play on Google Chrome.\n\nThe watch, created in 2024, is listed for $14,900. A similar model sold at an auction on Loupe This last week for $10,451.\n\nOther Pelagos models are reselling for around $4,000 on pre-owned watch marketplaces.\n\nApple, Google, and Tudor did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nLoupe This cofounder Eric Ku said these sorts of collaborations come together through groups reaching out to companies like Tudor for customized watches with their logo and other changes, like an engraving.\n\nThey tend to sell for more than base models because of their limited quantities, Ku said, and they attract \"real fans\" of the brands they represent.\n\n\"For tech nerds like myself, the pirate flag is a symbol that has a long tradition of being used by the Apple folks,\" Ku said. \"Also, the imagery of that pirate flag is quite charming.\"",

    "description": "An oncology research student was diagnosed with breast cancer in her 20s. She said powerlifting helped her recover and stay strong through treatment.",
    "fullText": "When Ph.D. student LaShae Rolle felt a pain in her chest, she didn't think much of it at first.\n\nA little soreness made sense: she was working hard in the gym, preparing to bench press nearly 300 pounds for a powerlifting competition.\n\nThe pain came and went, but then Rolle noticed a lump in her breast, a textbook warning sign of breast cancer. It was a red flag she was deeply familiar with from her own studies on cancer prevention and treatment.\n\nAt 26, Rolle never expected to live through it herself. She had no family history of the disease and no genetic risk factors.\n\nStill, she took her symptoms seriously. She scheduled a check-up and mammogram for peace of mind. When the results came back, she and the medical technicians were shocked to discover it was cancer.\n\n\"This was not on my radar. I only did it to check the box so I didn't have any regrets moving forward,\" Rolle told Business Insider.\n\nNow 28, Rolle said she's working to raise awareness about cancer screenings for young patients who may not even realize they're sick.\n\n\"The only reason I was able to recognize the signs early on is because of my background being in a lab learning about cancer control and prevention,\" she said. \"I'm very grateful; not everybody knows.\"\n\nEven a decade ago, certain cancers were rarely diagnosed in younger patients. The median age for breast cancer is 62, and for people without a genetic risk or family history of the disease, preventive screenings don't start until the age of 40.\n\nIncreasingly, patients in their 20s and 30s are being diagnosed with breast cancer, as well as colorectal cancer. It's a big problem for the healthcare industry, accustomed mainly to treating very young or older patients, to tackle the growing number of early-onset cancer patients.\n\nRolle said she saw this firsthand at the cancer center where she underwent treatment. In the waiting room, she was the youngest patient by decades. When her mom accompanied Rolle to appointments, the medical staff assumed her mother was the patient.\n\nIt was an intensely isolating experience, Rolle said, compounded by having to postpone some major exams for her Ph.D. After struggling to find peers she could relate to, Rolle said an app called Cancer Buddy helped her connect with patients of a similar age and diagnosis.\n\nThat community of young patients was key to dealing with the distinct challenges of treatment in her 20s, Rolle said: the financial burden, the rush for fertility preservation, and the shattered illusion of youthful invincibility.\n\n\"It's very hard, especially when you're young, because we think nothing can happen to us,\" Rolle said. \"You have to just come to grips with what is your reality right now and find ways to accept it.\"\n\nAfter the initial shock of the diagnosis, Rolle saw a unique opportunity to put everything she had studied into practice.\n\nShe had pursued oncology to understand how to stave off disease with exercise and diet. In fact, one of the first questions she asked her Ph.D. mentor was about whether cancer patients should work out.\n\nShe had been lifting since college, where she hit the gym during basketball training, but decided she preferred lifting heavy to running up and down the court.\n\nSo when she became the patient, Rolle had no intention of giving up weightlifting even during treatment. Guidelines suggest light exercise can help cancer patients, but don't say much about intense workouts.\n\nWhen there wasn't much information on what she should do, Rolle researched and wrote it herself. She published her experience in 2025 case study, the first of its kind to analyze elite powerlifting during chemotherapy.\n\nRolle used everything she knew about the benefits of weight training, combined with conditioning exercise like biking, to make exercise a part of her plan to recovery plan.\n\nThroughout treatment, including surgeries, she maintained about 90% of her strength and said that being an athlete helped her meet the challenge head-on. It even prompted the doctors she spoke with to start recommending more exercise to patients.\n\n\"It completely changed the way I did things,\" Rolle said. \"I don't think I would've had the confidence to do this, nor the expertise in this area to even try something like this. It's crazy when I look back at it.\"\n\nRolle completed her cancer treatment in October 2024 and is in remission. Her recent scans continue to come back clear. She still takes medication and hormone therapy, and will do so for the next eight years to stay cancer-free.\n\nIn the meantime, Rolle is back on track to graduate with her Ph.D. this spring. She's still lifting heavy, thinking about returning to powerlifting competitions, and coming to terms with her new identity as a cancer survivor.\n\n\"For me, it just looks like trying not to stress, getting stuff done, advocating, doing research, living my life to the best possible ability I can,\" Rolle said.",

However, its internal GPU belongs to the SM12x series, distinct from the data center-grade Blackwell (SM100). This creates a subtle architectural gap: the latest LLM stacks, heavily reliant on MLA·DSA-specific kernels like GLM-5, \"Blackwell support\" alone doesn't guarantee immediate compatibility. This creates a subtle architectural gap requiring separate code management for Hopper, data center Blackwell, and consumer Blackwell. The engineering team examines Spark, which is based on Blackwell but features a slightly different architecture.",
    "fullText": "Scaling the Blackwell Architecture, © NVIDIA\n\nIn October 2025, NVIDIA released the DGX Spark, a compact AI supercomputer designed to bring datacenter-class AI performance to a desktop form factor. Built on the Grace Blackwell architecture, the DGX Spark packs 128GB of unified memory and 1 PFLOP of AI compute into a 150mm x 150mm chassis, enough to run and fine-tune large language models up to 200B parameters locally. At Lablup, we bought 20 units shortly after launch and have been running them in-house since.\n\nDifferent KV caching techniques, © [liorsinai.github.io](https://liorsinai.github.io/machine-learning/2025/02/22/mla.html)\n\nOur engineering team recently tried running GLM-5 inference on DGX Spark. GLM-5 uses two techniques together: MLA (Multi-head Latent Attention) and DSA (DeepSeek Sparse Attention). When a large language model generates text, it stores Key and Value vectors from previously processed tokens in a memory region called the KV cache,1 and this cache grows rapidly as models get bigger and inputs get longer. MLA compresses the cache into lower-dimensional vectors to save memory, while DSA reduces compute by dynamically selecting only the important tokens for attention calculation instead of attending to every token. MLA was first introduced in DeepSeek-V2 and later adopted by DeepSeek-V3 and GLM-5. GLM-5 adds DSA on top of that, improving both long-context performance and deployment cost. Running these techniques efficiently on GPUs requires specialized kernels,2 and the two most prominent implementations today are DeepSeek's FlashMLA and FlashInfer.\n\nBoth projects explicitly list Blackwell support, so we expected them to work on DGX Spark. They did not. FlashMLA ships two backends: one for SM100 (datacenter Blackwell) and one for SM90 (Hopper). The DGX Spark GPU reports as SM12x (compute capability 12.1), which is compatible with neither. The SM100 kernel requires the tcgen05 instruction and TMEM, a dedicated hardware memory for tensor operations. The SM90 kernel requires WGMMA. SM12x has none of these. FlashAttention had the same problem: SM12x is absent from the supported architecture list, and the runtime printed \"FlashAttention only supports Ampere GPUs or newer.\" FlashAttention 4 (FA4), the Blackwell-specific version under development, only supports SM100.\n\nDGX Spark is Blackwell. The kernels claim to support Blackwell. So why don't they work? Answering that question required looking more carefully at what's inside GB10.\n\nNVIDIA DGX Spark: Powered by the GB10 Superchip, © NVIDIA\n\nGB10 is a multi-die SoC co-designed by NVIDIA and MediaTek. A TSMC 3nm ARM CPU die (ten Cortex-X925 cores plus ten Cortex-A725 cores) connects to a Blackwell GPU die via NVLink C2C, and 128GB of LPDDR5X memory is shared between the CPU and GPU at 273 GB/s bandwidth. The GPU side has 48 SMs,3 6,144 CUDA cores, and delivers 1 PFLOP at sparse FP4. In terms of raw scale, it sits between the RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti. Run nvidia-smi and the architecture field reads 'Blackwell.' NVIDIA calls GB10 a \"Grace Blackwell Superchip.\" There is no reason not to call it Blackwell.\n\nBut check the compute capability,4 and a different picture starts to emerge.\n\nCUDA's compute capability numbering reveals that Blackwell is not a single architecture. Datacenter and consumer/edge parts carry different compute capabilities.\n\nRTX 5090 is SM120, DGX Spark is SM121. I'll refer to both as SM12x throughout this post.\n\nThe compute capability numbers split into 10.x and 12.x, and this is not like the Ampere situation where 8.0 and 8.6 diverged within the same major version. The major numbers themselves are different, and 11.x is entirely vacant. Looking back across Pascal (6.0/6.1), Ampere (8.0/8.6), and Hopper/Ada (9.0/8.9), no generation has produced this wide a gap. CUTLASS build flags reflect the split too: datacenter targets use sm100a (architecture-accelerated) while consumer targets use sm120f (family-level), with different suffix conventions.\n\nTensor cores are the dedicated hardware that GPUs use to accelerate matrix multiplication, the core operation of deep learning. The instruction set (ISA6) that drives these tensor cores has changed with each generation.\n\nEficient, pipelined mainloop body used in CUTLASS GEMMs, © [NVIDIA](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/2.11/media/docs/efficient_gemm.md)\n\nMatrix multiplication works by chopping large matrices into small tiles and computing them iteratively. Each tile's intermediate result (the accumulator) needs to be stored somewhere temporarily. From Volta through Hopper, these intermediate results lived in the register file,7 where CUDA cores and tensor cores had to share the same limited space. Datacenter Blackwell (SM100) added TMEM, a dedicated 256KB-per-SM hardware memory sitting next to the tensor cores, along with the tcgen05 instruction to control it. Tensor cores can now operate independently from CUDA cores without competing for register file bandwidth. That is the single biggest architectural change in SM100.\n\nSM12x lacks the TMEM hardware entirely, and therefore does not support the tcgen05 instruction that controls it. The same goes for Hopper's WGMMA: compiling WGMMA code targeting SM12x produces ptxas error: Instruction 'wgmma.fence' not supported on .target 'sm_120'. The tensor core instruction that SM12x actually uses is an extended version of mma.sync, the same instruction family that dates back to Ampere. It adds support for new numeric formats like FP4 and FP6, but the programming model itself is the oldest one available. Looking at the last column of the table, SM100 writes intermediate results to dedicated memory (TMEM), while SM12x reads from and writes to registers, exactly like Ampere. Datacenter Blackwell turned the tensor core into an autonomous compute unit; consumer Blackwell put new data types on top of the oldest programming model.\n\nBecause SM90 kernels use WGMMA, SM100 kernels use tcgen05, and SM12x kernels use extended mma.sync, there is no kernel compatibility among the three architectures. Developers have to maintain three separate code paths.\n\nPorting existing kernels to SM12x is not straightforward, either. A 64x64 matrix tile that SM100 processes in one operation must be broken into 16x8 chunks requiring 32 separate mma.sync calls. Memory load patterns, inter-thread synchronization, and thread organization all need to be redesigned.\n\nNVIDIA shipping different microarchitectures under the same generation name is not new to Blackwell. In the Ampere generation (2020), the datacenter GA100 (A100) was manufactured on TSMC 7nm with 64 FP32 cores per SM and HBM2 memory. The consumer GA102 (RTX 3090), released the same September, used Samsung 8nm, had 128 FP32 cores per SM, and shipped with GDDR6X. GA102 repurposed the Turing-era INT32 datapath to also handle FP32 operations, doubling the shader count per SM, while GA100 skipped that change to focus on FP64 compute and HBM bandwidth. Different fabs, different SM designs, different memory interfaces, same \"Ampere\" branding.\n\nWith Hopper/Ada Lovelace (2022), NVIDIA separated the names outright. Datacenter Hopper (H100, SM90) was announced in March 2022; consumer Ada Lovelace (RTX 4090, SM89) followed in September as a distinct architecture. Compute capabilities were different too: 9.0 for Hopper, 8.9 for Ada Lovelace.\n\nIn Pascal (2016), GP100 (Tesla P100) had NVLink and HBM2; GP102 (GTX 1080 Ti) had neither.\n\nDatacenter chips and consumer chips allocate their transistor budgets differently. Datacenter parts spend die area on FP64 compute, HBM memory bandwidth, NVLink/NVSwitch, and MIG partitioning. Consumer parts spend on RT cores, display outputs, and power efficiency. The entire GB10 SoC runs at 140W; a single B200 GPU draws 1,000W.\n\nSM100's TMEM, tcgen05, and 2-SM cooperative MMA are designed for datacenter environments where thousands of GPUs process massive matrix operations. Models like GLM-5 and DeepSeek-V3 use MoE8 architectures that activate only a subset of the model's parameters (expert subnets) per input token, so instead of running one large matrix multiply for a long time, they rapidly switch between many smaller ones. TMEM absorbs the accumulator storage pressure during these switches, and tcgen05's asynchronous execution allows prefetching the next expert's weights while the current expert is still computing. On a DGX Spark, where LPDDR5X provides 273 GB/s of memory bandwidth, the bottleneck is getting data from memory to the compute units, not tensor core throughput. Investing die area in TMEM and tcgen05 would yield little practical benefit under those conditions. SM12x keeping the proven mma.sync approach while adding FP4/FP6 support, 5th-gen tensor cores, and RT cores reflects this tradeoff. At Hot Chips 2025, NVIDIA disclosed that GB10 worked on TSMC 3nm A0 (first silicon) without revision, because it was assembled from validated IP blocks rather than designed from scratch.\n\nFlashMLA's sparse decoding kernel internally uses FP8 KV cache together with either WGMMA- or tcgen05-based matrix multiply. Neither is available on SM12x, so an SM12x backend would need to be written from the ground up. FlashInfer is in the same situation. FlashAttention's supported architecture list includes only Ampere, Ada Lovelace, and Hopper, and the runtime does not recognize SM12x as \"newer than Ampere.\" FlashAttention 4 (FA4) supports SM100 only. In the vLLM and SGLang ecosystems, SM12x-related issues keep surfacing. The most common: FP8 block-scaled GEMM kernels written for SM100 fail to run on RTX 5090 (SM120). SGLang's published DeepSeek-V3 serving configurations include H200 (SM90) and B200 (SM100) setups, but nothing for SM12x.\n\nTriton treats SM12x as SM80 (Ampere), disabling all Blackwell-related optimizations, and vLLM requires the --enforce-eager flag. Running attention kernels on SM12x is not entirely impossible: some developers have reported re-implementing FlashAttention in CUDA C++ using Ampere-era instructions (mma.sync, cp.async) or falling back to cuDNN's SDPA backend. These workarounds only support standard dense attention, though. MLA-specific kernels, sparse attention, and FP8 KV cache are out of reach, which makes it difficult to get full performance from models like GLM-5 or DeepSeek-V3.\n\nOne thing DGX Spark does offer that conventional desktops cannot: its 128GB of memory is shared between CPU and GPU without partitioning. A discrete GPU setup physically cannot do this. The bandwidth is lower than HBM, but being able to fit an entire 200B-parameter model in memory on a desktop machine is a rare capability. Once SM12x-native kernels materialize, the practical value of that memory pool changes considerably.\n\nGB10 is Blackwell. It has 5th-gen tensor cores, supports FP4/FP6 arithmetic, and includes RT cores. What it does not share with datacenter Blackwell is the instruction set. SM12x's tensor core programming model is closer to Ampere's mma.sync than to datacenter Blackwell's tcgen05, and for kernel developers, that means maintaining three separate code paths: Hopper, datacenter Blackwell, and consumer Blackwell.\n\nThis kind of datacenter-versus-consumer architectural split has recurred in every generation since Pascal, and the gap is wider in Blackwell because datacenter-only features like TMEM and tcgen05 are larger in scope than anything that came before. While a $4,000 desktop device cannot possibly contain the full instruction set of a $30,000+ data center GPU, the existence of instruction-level branching under the same 'Blackwell' name is an engineering detail worth noting for developers writing or relying on CUDA kernels.\n\nTry Backend.AI GO on DGX Spark.

    "fullText": "Head coach Andy Farrell has called on Ireland to \"put our stamp\" and insisted their underdog status should have no bearing on Saturday's must-win Six Nations game against England (14:10 GMT).\n\nHaving followed up a dismal defeat by France with a hard-fought victory over Italy, Ireland are aiming to deliver a statement result against an English side still hurting from last week's Calcutta Cup loss to Scotland at Murrayfield.\n\nFarrell has made five changes for the trip to Allianz Stadium, including Jack Crowley's reinstatement at fly-half and the return of British and Irish Lions Jamison Gibson-Park, Tadhg Furlong, Tadhg Beirne and Josh van der Flier.\n\nAsked if he has seen a determined mindset from his players this week, Farrell said: \"Yeah, but you've heard talk plenty of times about 'we've trained, we've prepared well' and all that but you'd expect that from this Irish team because that's the type of lads we've got.\n\n\"We care about preparation and all that but you've still got to go out there and deliver. We want to be a team that goes to places like this and fire a few shots, there's no doubt about that.\"\n\nSeeking back-to-back Grand Slams, Ireland were favourites when they travelled to England in 2024, a game they lost 23-22 after Marcus Smith's late drop-goal.\n\nDespite their loss to Scotland, England are favourites for Saturday's game as they chase a 10th successive home win, but Farrell says his side's perceived underdog status should have no bearing on the appetite they bring to the 144th instalment of this old rivalry.\n\n\"I don't want that to be the case at all,\" he said.\n\n\"Human nature tells you that works for some people but we want to be as good as we possibly can. We want to be able to deal with being favourites or not.\n\n\"That should be irrelevant if we're in the right frame of mind.\"\n\nFarrell will come up against several of the England players he brought on last summer's British and Irish Lions tour to Australia, including Northampton Saints back row Henry Pollock, who starts his first game for England.\n\n\"[He's a] bit of a free-spirit,\" Farrell said of Pollock, who was the youngest player in last year's Lions squad.\n\n\"He backs himself. Great lad, good fun. He's a bundle of energy and I suppose that's what they're looking for in terms of bringing him into the starting line like we've done with a few as well.\"",

    "description": "In his BBC Sport column, ex-Premier League boss Tony Pulis explains why more matches in a shorter space of time might mean more injuries, and why the expansion of tournaments does not help players or fans.",
    "fullText": "With the season heading into its final months, games are coming thick and fast, especially for the Premier League clubs still in Europe.\n\nWith the extra games, travelling, time difference and the added disadvantage when teams return to face an away game in the Premier League, player welfare is another problem for managers of those teams. How do you maintain the quality of rest time that you know the players need to perform at the highest level and reduce the risks of injury?\n\nOut of the teams in action this week, Newcastle have had the longest journey. Their 2,529-mile trek to Baku is the furthest distance ever travelled by an English side in the Champions League.\n\nThe journey there and back, plus the difficulty of an away game at Manchester City on Saturday evening, is a tough ask - especially when you factor in how, statistically, the results usually go against the team playing away in Europe.\n\nThis was something I had to deal with at Stoke when we were in the Europa League, and faced long flights to Israel, Ukraine, Croatia and Turkey.\n\nWe tried all kinds of methods to help our recovery, sometimes flying straight back after games, or staying overnight and allowing the medical staff to take the lads in the mornings for a light recovery session, having breakfast then flying home.\n\nIt was really difficult to find the most balanced way. Irrespective of what we tried, having to play an away game that same weekend was really tough, and we suffered a couple of heavy Premier League defeats afterwards.\n\nThe same goes for many teams, though. I don't think anyone has truly found the answer to that particular problem, even if there were ways to manage players' fitness over the course of the season that I used effectively myself.\n\nIn the modern-day game, enormous investment is made into all different departments of Premier League clubs, and the medical and sports science departments are especially well-supported.\n\nToday, these departments offer enormous amounts of data on fitness issues and players are without doubt treated with more care and attention than ever before.\n\nGone are the days where you were encouraged to take pain-killing injections or tablets just to get you on the pitch, which were never questioned. Many players in the 1970s and 80s relied on appearance money and win bonuses to pay their mortgages so going through the pain barrier was never an issue.\n\nThe amount of change in our game since then in all departments is quite astonishing, and obviously most of it has made things better for all concerned.\n\nFor all of those advances, however, there are still questions being asked about soft-tissue injuries and why so many are still occurring.\n\nIn my years in the Premier League, I worked with some fantastic medical staff, club doctors, physios and fitness coaches.\n\nAt the beginning of every pre-season, I would explain what I needed from every single person mentioned above. My main topic was these soft-tissue injuries, like hamstring, calf and groin strains. I believed if the players were prepared and looked after in the right manner then we could avoid them.\n\nMy thinking was that joint injuries occurring from competitive challenges are always going to happen and we could not control those incidents, but muscular issues, we could.\n\nMy pre-season consisted of 10-14 days of endurance work, all within a certain range that would not impede or trouble the players' main leg muscles.\n\nAfter consultation with my medical staff, to ensure the players were strong enough, sessions would get progressively shorter and quicker, with and without the ball.\n\nOnce a solid strength and conditioning base had been implemented, and the season had begun, our general routine would entail pre-activation exercises like glute bridges and band walks, light weights, and lots of movement stretches.\n\nOne hour and 20 minutes each day on the grass was all I wanted and early in the week I would generally push the lads pretty hard, then taper it off closer to game day.\n\nThe above approach worked well for me so, having read up about the number of soft-tissue injuries occurring now, I contacted medical people in the game who I respect to try to find out why.\n\nObviously I wondered if strength and conditioning programmes like the ones I used had dropped off, but I got a big rebuff on that. I was told that, as in most sports, footballers today have got bigger, stronger and quicker.\n\nIt is not down to the players playing more games, either. Manchester United had 66 competitive games in 2008-09, Liverpool had 63 in 2021-22 and this season Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal will all experience something similar.\n\nSo, what has happened over the past five years to affect our top players?\n\nToday, there are more than two or three quick players in every team - the difference there is massive compared to when I started out as a manager more than 30 years ago.\n\nThat means that, while the distance covered by players has not altered much over time, the players are accelerating more, and also more often. It leads to much more stress in the top levels of their payload.\n\nSurely this can be managed? Yes, but it is getting harder. Not because players are playing more games, but because they are playing more in a shorter period of time.\n\nOver the past few years, players have started to question the amount of games they are now asked to play at international level, on top of the demands of club football.\n\nFifa and Uefa have increased everything, not just the fixture lists, but the number and size of competitions too.\n\nLet's start with this year's World Cup, where a record 48 teams will be competing and playing a total of 104 games - double the number the last time the tournament was held in the United States in 1994. It will take 72 group games to lose just 16 of those teams before the first knockout stage.\n\nSimilarly, the new Champions League format also has a busload of teams.\n\nIt takes 144 games to get rid of 12 of the 36 clubs, before you even reach the knockout stages, and I have completely ignored all these early matches as I don't understand how teams can lose game after game but still qualify for the next round.\n\nAdd to this two Europa League competitions and a new Club World Cup format and you can understand how busy Fifa and Uefa have been in building up their own empires.\n\nI congratulate the so-called smaller countries who will experience the World Cup for the first time this summer.\n\nHopefully millions of supporters will enjoy the experience too but I am sure many neutral supporters will question the adage that bigger is better, especially because the expansion of all of these tournaments will adversely affect the Premier League.\n\nFor me, the Premier League is the best league in the world and we should be protecting it.\n\nMany people in the game are concerned about player safety and although I am old school when it comes to how you look after players, I do believe that the top teams and players should be protected more to ensure our league remains the best and also the most successful in the world.\n\nTeams in the NFL, the only international sports league that can compare with the Premier League's success, only play one game a week.\n\nIt is an elite league, with elite players, and although they play a different sport which means that, physically, they operate on a different level, they are very conscious of having their best players in their best shape for their clubs and games.\n\nThe same should apply to the Premier League and the governing bodies in our country must be very careful with this dramatic increase in Fifa and Uefa's conquest of new concepts and new competitions.\n\nOur top players should not be used as cash cows to play in competitions that are over-subscribed.\n\nI believe football's top competitions should showcase our elite players at their peak level for their clubs and countries, so the Champions League and World Cup should be an almighty step up in class and a different level to anything we see on our own domestic stage.\n\nUnfortunately, that is not the case. In my view, Fifa and Uefa have watered down both competitions, and it feels to me like the main aim now is to make a shed-load of money from games that have no substance, and little meaning.\n\nTony Pulis was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

Or have the English teams just shown their superiority?\n\nMan Utd beat Atletico to reach Women's Champions League last eight\n\nArsenal beat OH Leuven in Women's Champions League\n\nWomen's Champions League to expand to 18 teams\n\nReigning champions Arsenal had to kick off their campaign against record eight-time winners Lyon, who they beat in the semi-finals last season.\n\nThis time they lost and they were also beaten by Bayern Munich in the league phase, meaning they had work to do to qualify.\n\nIt was a nervy few months but victories against Real Madrid and FC Twente helped Arsenal finish fifth in the table. They were handed a favourable tie in their knockout play-offs, avoiding more established European teams like Wolfsburg and Juventus to take on competition debutants OH Leuven, who they had already beaten 3-0 in the league phase.\n\nThey bettered that scoreline in the first leg, winning 4-0, but Arsenal boss Renee Slegers insisted it was not straightforward, saying her side just found form when it mattered.\n\n\"Ahead of the first game, we were very aware that Leuven had made it difficult for teams in Europe,\" said Slegers after their 3-1 victory in the second leg.\n\n\"We actually played really well in Leuven and were clinical. When we go into the second game, we know we're already 4-0 up, so it becomes a different game.\"\n\nUnited had to face Atletico Madrid, who have reached the main draw six times in the past decade, having also played them in the league phase.\n\nThe Spanish side are sixth in Liga F and 25 points adrift of leaders Barcelona.\n\nThe competition has been far from easy for United though, having to play three qualifying rounds before the league phase - coming from behind to beat Brann - and then meeting two-time winners Wolfsburg, Italian giants Juventus and record-holders Lyon in their group.\n\n\"For sure, it hasn't felt easy. I've really enjoyed the structure of the Champions League to get here,\" said United boss Marc Skinner. \"It's exposed us to different styles of play. The experiences have helped us grow quickly.\n\n\"You look back to when we played Lyon, the close Valerenga game and Juventus in the last game of the league phase - the growth is incredible from our team.\"\n\nEven Chelsea, who were top seeds and qualified directly for the quarter-finals, had to play fellow last-eight qualifiers Barcelona and Wolfsburg in the league phase.\n\nThey have Arsenal next, and could still face Lyon and Barcelona on route to the final.\n\nIn the new format, 18 teams face six opponents, drawn home or away, and the top four in the league phase go straight into the quarter-finals, the bottom six are eliminated and the remaining eight join a seeded play-off for the knockout stage.\n\nPreviously, groups of four would play each other home and away with the top two going through to the knockout stages.\n\nThat meant the established teams often had a shootout between themselves for top spot in the group - giving them a more favourable tie in the next round - while lower-ranked sides struggled to progress.\n\nIt felt like there was more jeopardy this time around but it is a familiar group of heavyweights in the quarter-finals, with debutants United the exception.\n\nTim Stillman, a lifelong Arsenal fan and writer for Arseblog news, told BBC Sport it has felt like a \"more serene\" campaign for his side this season and that the new format \"protects bigger clubs against jeopardy\".\n\n\"The head-to-head games really defined the group stages in previous seasons. Losing to Bayern Munich last year created a lot of tension and drama that maybe wasn't there in the new league phase format,\" he added.\n\n\"Arsenal would have had to have not only lost the two games against teams from seeded pot two - which they did - but to have lost twice against lower-ranked teams from pot three or four too. It's not very likely.\n\n\"If you slightly mess up the league phase, like Arsenal did, you go into the play-offs and you'll most likely get a winnable tie.\"\n\nBoss Slegers added that Arsenal were \"only one story\" and you would need to see how this style \"works over time\" in terms of whether it favours top clubs.\n\nDespite format change debates, one thing English clubs have undoubtedly shown is that they are among Europe's elite.\n\nArsenal are still the only club from these shores to win the competition, doing so twice, but in 2023-24, they failed to progress from the qualifying rounds.\n\nThey bounced back last season, playing 15 matches en route to the final where they stunned Barcelona to take the title.\n\nThey did not suddenly become winners overnight - they had been capable for a while but had not shown it consistently.\n\nMeanwhile, Chelsea are serial semi-finalists having been in the past three, and were runners-up in 2021.\n\n\"We have a very strong league and we have been trying to get to that point where we don't just have one team representing us in the latter stages,\" former England midfielder Fara Williams said on Disney+.\n\n\"The fact we have three teams in the quarter-finals shows the growth of the league and that when you invest, this is what can happen.\"\n\nCurrent WSL leaders Manchester City have found the Champions League tough previously, knocked out in qualifying in 2022 and 2023 - and they have not progressed beyond the quarter-finals since 2018.\n\nBut United have found a way to break through and their strong defensive record includes eight clean sheets from 12 matches.\n\nThey will fancy their chances against Bayern Munich next while England are guaranteed to have at least one representative in the semi-finals with one of Chelsea or Arsenal progressing.\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "fullText": "Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney hopes Pep Guardiola will stay at Manchester City beyond this season because he has set \"a benchmark\" for all other managers.\n\nThe 55-year-old has been in charge of City since 2016 and led them to six Premier League titles, while they are in with a chance of a seventh this season.\n\nHowever, there is uncertainty over whether Guardiola will still be manager next season, with the expectation that a decision on his future will be made towards - or after - the end of this campaign.\n\n\"Some players will want him to leave, some will want him to stay, it depends whether you are in the team or not and that is the same for any manager,\" said Rooney on the latest episode of The Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n\"I hope he stays because he is brilliant for the Premier League and you want the best managers in the Premier League.\n\n\"He has set a benchmark over the past 10 years for everyone else.\"\n\nIn December, former Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca was heavily linked with a return to City, where he previously worked as a coach under Guardiola.\n\nHowever, Rooney believes a club legend who previously played under Guardiola would be better suited to take charge.\n\n\"If Pep does go, they have to go and get [current Bayern Munich boss] Vincent Kompany,\" he added.\n\n\"He knows the club, he has been successful with Bayern in a similar way. It looks like he has learned from Pep.\n\n\"Pep will probably choose the next manager. If he is going, he will probably be part of the process to choose the next one.\n\n\"I just think in terms of Pep, he looks at himself as a bit of a teacher and he has been at the club for 10 years, he will want to leave the club in a good place.\"\n\nLeaders Arsenal suffered a blow in their bid to win the Premier League on Wednesday when they let slip a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2 at bottom club Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nThat put them five points clear of second-placed Manchester City, who have a game in hand.\n\nShould they win that, it will set up a pivotal meeting at Etihad Stadium on 18 April when City host Arsenal.\n\nThe two rivals also face each other in the Carabao Cup final on 22 March, and could potentially face each other in the Champions League knockouts.\n\n\"I think a big factor will be if Manchester City and Arsenal meet in the Champions League,\" added Rooney, who was speaking before Arsenal's draw at Wolves.\n\n\"The emotions around the League Cup final, the Champions League games, if that is the case, and then the game at the Etihad. The emotion around those games and what that will bring, whoever comes out on top in those I think will win the league.\n\n\"I would prefer Arsenal to win it. I played for Manchester United for 13 years! For me, Liverpool are the ones I wouldn't want to win it and then it would be City. I think Arsenal will just win it.\"\n\nListen to all the episodes of The Wayne Rooney Show on BBC Sounds.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Jay Gulledge lost his job in 2025 after USAID was dismantled.\n\nA year on, Gulledge has found a director-level job that he finds meaningful.\n\nHowever, Gulledge said he feels survivor's guilt as former colleagues remain unemployed.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jay Gulledge, 59, who is based in Tennessee. The termination of his employment at USAID and current employment have been verified by Business Insider.\n\nWhen the Trump administration dismantled the US Agency for International Development last year, I was one of the thousands of employees who lost their jobs. I was 58 at the time.\n\nA year on from being laid off, I'm happy with how things have turned out for me: I work for an exceptional organization with great colleagues.\n\nBut, every so often, when I talk to a former colleague or see one of their LinkedIn posts, I start to feel survivor's guilt. I ask myself: Why was I so lucky?\n\nI've had a long and winding career, and my route into working at USAID was circuitous.\n\nIn the early 2000s, I was an academic scientist. I went on to work at a climate-change think tank, then in middle management at a laboratory. I took some years out to consult and build a real-estate portfolio, with the aim of generating passive income.\n\nIn my 50s, I became interested in international development. There's a long-running American Association for the Advancement of Science fellowship program that places scientists and engineers into US federal agencies.\n\nI didn't have a background in international development, just an interest. The fellowship was a foot in the door of USAID and, starting in September 2022, I spent a year there as a fellow before joining as a climate change integration adviser on a two-year direct-hire contract.\n\nWhen I joined the fellowship, I was 56, and I expected USAID to be the final chapter of my career.\n\nMy work fit squarely within the Biden administration's priorities, but I knew those priorities would shift with a change in government.\n\nWhen Donald Trump won the 2024 election, and later when Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, were in the news, I assumed my days were numbered.\n\nNone of us imagined the agency would be shut down entirely.\n\nThe atmosphere last February was chaotic. We'd heard a lot of different things, and we didn't really know what was going on.\n\nMany colleagues described this period as scary. It didn't feel scary to me. Sadness was my dominant feeling, not a personal sadness, but hurting for the world and my country. USAID had inefficiencies, but it helped millions of people who aren't getting that help anymore.\n\nOn February 19, 2025, I received an email that my termination would take effect on March 5.\n\nLosing my job was a hit, but at 58, I was later in my career, I had some passive income from my real-estate portfolio, I don't have kids, and I was going to be able to pay my bills. It wasn't going to devastate me financially or harm my family in any significant way, like it may have done for others.\n\nWhen my termination took effect, I tried to find a job that would bring me career satisfaction. That late in my career, I didn't need to find a job purely for the money.\n\nI was hearing that many of my colleagues were applying for dozens of jobs and getting no calls back. The market was flooded with job seekers in areas related to my expertise. There were thousands of competitors for every job, and the risk was that I might not find anything.\n\nI didn't apply for many jobs, and largely avoided international development roles, because I had former colleagues who were far more qualified for them than me.\n\nI knew that if all else failed, I could return to investing in real estate.\n\nI was unemployed for about six months before I found the perfect role as the director of scientific programs at PSE Health Energy, a research center that examines the health implications of the energy system.\n\nA year on, I'm happy with where I've landed. I love learning about new scientific concepts and working with exceptional colleagues.\n\nStill, there's an undeniable sense of loss. I worked for years to move into international development, intentionally cultivating that path, and it was taken away from me. There's nothing I can do about that.\n\nI also still feel survivor's guilt. It's not a daily thing, but it often comes up when I pause to reflect. I think about my former colleagues, really capable people, who are still unemployed.\n\nFor many of them, they'd been at USAID for their whole careers, and really cared about their work. My identity was not built around my job because I'd only been there for a couple of years.\n\nI landed on my feet, but the sheer number of people let go meant not everyone could. They must feel an even deeper sense of loss than I do.\n\nBusiness Insider contacted the Office of Personnel Management for a comment but did not receive a response.",

    "fullText": "Almost as many Americans live near a Mexican restaurant as those who live near a Walmart. The ubiquitous retail chain makes a bold claim on its website.\n\n\"Approximately 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart or Sam’s Club,\" the retailer shared on its website.\n\nMexican restaurants aren't quite as common, but it's actually close, except the turnover in the restaurant space has been intense. Soon, another popular Mexican chain, Tito's Burritos & Wings, will join a growing list of deceased restaurant brands.\n\n\"Mexican culture is widely established in America’s restaurants. Some 11% of restaurants in the United States serve Mexican food, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from SafeGraph, which curates information about millions of places of interest around the globe, and the user review site Yelp,\" Pew Research reported.\n\nFor context, Walmart’s reach is based on the company’s own disclosure, while Pew’s estimate relies on independent location data to measure where Mexican restaurants operate.\n\nThe actual number of Americans with easy access to a Mexican restaurant, however, might be bigger than Walmart's reach.\n\n\"This analysis finds that 85% of U.S. counties have at least one Mexican restaurant. In turn, the counties that don’t have Mexican restaurants tend to have small populations. The 15% of counties without any Mexican restaurants have about 4 million people living in them. That is just 1% of the total U.S. population,\" Pew added.\n\nThat level of penetration, however, also means competition is intense, and after a year of sales struggles, a popular Mexican restaurant chain, Tito’s Burritos & Wings, has decided to close all its remaining locations.\n\nThe past few years have hit Mexican chains especially hard. Abuelo's filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October and closed multiple locations. That followed Chapter 11 filings by On the Border, which was purchased by Pappas Restaurant Group, and Tijuana Flats, which has emerged from bankruptcy and has continued operations.\n\nTito's Burritos & Wings won't be filing for bankruptcy, but it will be closing all its remaining locations after dinner service on March 1. The chain's owners shared the news on their website.\n\nThe chain currently has three locations. Its menu includes Mexican classics, burritos and tacos, as well as wings and chicken strips.\n\n\"Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for being part of this journey — whether you came to know Tito’s recently or have been with us since the beginning in May of 2005 — your support, stories, celebrations, and countless shared meals have meant more to us than we can ever fully express,\" the owners shared.",

    "fullText": "Wales head coach Steve Tandy is looking forward to reunite with his old Scotland friends at the Principality Stadium on Saturday.\n\nTandy spent almost six years as the Scottish defence coach before taking over the Wales job in September 2025.\n\n\"Every game is emotional, and I've got a lot of friends and players who I've gone through a lot with after six years of coaching them,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"I'm grateful for that time in Scotland – the people, the fans, everything was outstanding.\n\n\"It will be a huge game for me, but no different to any other game we want to win.\n\n\"We want to put a performance in and it will be a special day because there are a lot of amazing memories from Scotland.\n\n\"We are ready to create memories in Wales now. It's my home nation so it has the potential to be even better.\"\n\nScotland head coach Gregor Townsend will be preparing his team to face a struggling Wales side but Tandy accepts there will be a familiarity on both sides.\n\n\"They know a lot about me and I know a lot about the coaching staff,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"They were amazing and we went through a lot with World Cups and amazing moments in the Six Nations.\n\n\"They know how I go about things too but it's probably a case of not overthinking it and delving into too much detail, because you can out-think yourself.\"\n\nInstead of working for Townsend, this time Tandy will be in direct opposition to his former boss.\n\n\"It'll be great to see him after the game,\" said Townsend.\n\n\"We've been sharing messages, not many this week, but in the first couple of games.\n\n\"We think very fondly of Steve. He spent a long time with us, so he's been a big influence on our players.\n\n\"He was a massive help to me as a coach, and I'm sure after the game, whatever the result, we can have a few beers in the changing room.\"\n\nTandy added: \"It'll definitely be different!\"\n\n\"He was brilliant for me, taught me lots about international rugby, encouraged me to be better and helped my growth and development.\n\n\"He pushed me to be out of my comfort zone and I feel your best growth comes when you get uncomfortable.\"\n\nIt has been uncomfortable so far for Tandy in his new role.\n\nIn his six games in charge, Wales have lost five and conceded 302 points and 42 tries.\n\nSo what are his expectations for his home country against the nation that gave him his international break?\n\n\"The expectation is to be better than we were last week,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"We understand how good Scotland are as well, they beat England comfortably and should have beaten the All Blacks.\n\n\"It's there in black and white, we've only won two games in 25 so it's not going to come with a click of a finger.\n\n\"We believe in this group and if we are better than we were last week, I think will get closer to where we want to be.\"\n\nKinghorn & Van der Merwe return for Scots in Wales\n\nCostelow and Hamer-Webb start for Wales v Scotland\n\nWales v Scotland - your guide to the Six Nations date\n\nScotland bounced back from defeat in Italy to sweep aside England 31-20 in last weekend's Calcutta Cup clash at Murrayfield.\n\nIt was a fifth win in six games for the Scots against the English but they have had problems backing that up in recent years.\n\n\"Seeing them become the team they are is pleasing, and seeing them beating England was good,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"Any international sport when you win, there's an emotional high after what goes into the game.\n\n\"Scotland are a pretty experienced team. They've gone through those moments and I feel they've backed up games as well.\n\n\"The England game has always been huge for them. They have lost games where they had beaten England before, but they're aware of it and talking about it.\n\n\"I don't think that's a major issue for them.\"\n\nWales v Scotland, Principality Stadium\n\nSaturday, 21 February at 16:40 GMT\n\nThe Warm Up: 'I was going to swear, but I won’t'\n\nWales have lost 23 out of their previous 25 Tests with 13 successive losses in the Six Nations.\n\nThey have not won a Six Nations home game since beating Scotland in February 2022, when Tandy was the visiting defence coach.\n\nSince that day, Wales have suffered 10 successive defeats in the tournament at the Principality Stadium.\n\nThe closest they have come to a Six Nations win in Cardiff was two years ago against Scotland when the hosts came back from 27-0 before agonisingly losing 27-26.\n\nTandy was again in the Scottish coaching box that day and has vivid memories of the game in February 2024 as Scotland achieved a first win in Cardiff for 22 years.\n\n\"That game, when we were at 27-0. I remember being in that Scotland dressing room, and then once something clicked into gear, then everything changed,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"The crowd changed - everything changed.\n\n\"Scotland, at the time, had two or three yellow cards in that game, which shifted the momentum of the game completely.\"\n\nTandy will be hoping this weekend it will be his new side that are victorious.",

    "fullText": "NEW DELHI (AP) — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday invited leaders of some of the top artificial intelligence companies to gather on stage as part of a commitment to build more “inclusive and multilingual” AI around the world.\n\nAnd they did. But what caught some of the audience's attention, and later went viral on social media, was an awkward interaction between two rival tech leaders: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei.\n\nModi, host of the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, clasped hands with those closest to him — Altman to his left and Google CEO Sundar Pichai to his right — and beckoned all 13 tech leaders to lift their hands up in a chain, like theater actors at the end of a show.\n\nEveryone was holding hands except for Altman and Amodei, who stood next to each other but for several seconds awkwardly avoided hand contact. Both eventually put up their fists instead.\n\nThe interaction quickly became a visual symbol of the deep rivalries in the AI industry, particularly between OpenAI and Anthropic, though Altman sought to brush off any deeper meaning.\n\n“I didn't know what was happening,” Altman later said in a video interview with Indian media outlet Moneycontrol. He said he was “confused, like when (Modi) grabbed my hand and put it up, and I just wasn’t sure what we were supposed to be doing.”\n\nThe two AI developers have a history, one that predates the creation of OpenAI's hit product, ChatGPT, and Anthropic's competing chatbot Claude.\n\nAmodei worked at OpenAI before he and a group that included his sister, Daniela Amodei, quit to form Anthropic in 2021. The newer company promised a clearer focus on the safety of the better-than-human technology called artificial general intelligence that both San Francisco firms aim to build.\n\nOpenAI first released ChatGPT in late 2022, revealing the huge commercial potential of AI large language models that could help write emails and computer code and answer questions. Anthropic followed with its first version of Claude in 2023.\n\nTheir different approaches spilled over into public debate earlier this month in the United States when Anthropic aired TV commercials during the Super Bowl that ridiculed OpenAI for the digital advertising it’s beginning to place in free and cheaper versions of ChatGPT.\n\nWhile Anthropic has centered its revenue model on selling Claude to other businesses, OpenAI has opened the doors to ads as a way of making money from the hundreds of millions of consumers who get ChatGPT for free. Altman took to social media to criticize the TV commercials as dishonest.\n\nO'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.",

    "fullText": "Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) on Thursday said local police will “ignore” a new law signed by Gov. Wes Moore (D) that prevents them from working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\n“Yesterday in my state they just passed a bill, Gov. Moore signed an emergency bill to prohibit local law enforcement from cooperating with ICE. And, you know, all the local law enforcement officers are saying, ‘We’re going to ignore that because we’re required to work with them,’” Hogan said during remarks at Politico Live’s “Governors Summit.”\n\n“So I get the whole, you know, overreach and overstep and doing the wrong things, but, you know, when they have violent criminals that they’re holding in jail that ICE wants to be detained, they, you know, they shouldn’t be let back on the street. So there’s two sides to this argument,” he added.\n\nHogan’s comments follow Moore’s decision to ban 287(g) agreements in the state, which allow ICE to deputize local law enforcement officers to carry out immigration enforcement.\n\n“We will continue to coordinate on shared public safety, priorities, including the lawful removal of noncitizen offenders who pose a risk to the public,” Moore said at the ceremony ahead of signing the bill, according to The Baltimore Sun.\n\n“We want ICE to be focused on violent criminals and people who are doing true harm to our society, as was promised by the Trump-Vance administration,” he added.\n\nMoore and other Democrats have accused ICE agents of breaking the law in recent months, citing an excessive use of force and racial discrimination.\n\nLast month, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said ICE needs “dramatic reform” after recent turmoil surrounding the agency.\n\n“ICE agents are the ones breaking the law, not the peaceful protesters. So, I believe we should not be funding an ICE operation that is completely lawless. It needs dramatic reform. You know, Donald Trump said he was going to go after the, quote, ‘worst of the worst,’” Van Hollen told ABC News’s Jonathan Karl.\n\n“If you look at their own data, 80 percent of the people they’re apprehending around the country posed no public threat whatsoever,” the Maryland senator added. “Instead of addressing that problem, they pulled down the data so we can no longer see it.”\n\nLawmakers in Washington remain at a standstill over funding the Department of Homeland Security in the midst of a partial government shutdown for the agency.\n\nLast week, House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) introduced a bill that would fund every agency under the Department of Homeland Security except ICE, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Office of the Secretary.\n\n“Immigration and Customs Enforcement cannot be abolished, but I will not provide a single dime of funding until we see radical changes in how it operates. If Republican leadership blocks this legislation from moving forward, they are responsible for any shuttered agencies, furloughed workers, missed paychecks, or reduced services,” DeLauro wrote in a statement.",

    "description": "Keith Andrews is impressing at Brentford in his first season as a manager, but how do the Bees keep getting their appointments so right?",
    "fullText": "How do Brentford keep doing it?\n\nWhen boss Thomas Frank left to join Tottenham Hotspur last summer, there were fears over what it would mean for the Bees.\n\nEven more so when managerial novice Keith Andrews was appointed as his successor.\n\nMany tipped Brentford as relegation candidates, but people should have known better.\n\nWhile Frank is licking his wounds after being sacked by Spurs, Andrews has the Bees challenging for European football - seventh in the Premier League and into the FA Cup fifth round.\n\nAndrews is the latest man to be appointed Brentford boss with little or no top-flight managerial experience and go on to surpass expectations, making light of his predecessor's departure.\n\nIn the past 15 years under owner Matthew Benham, Brentford have appointed just six permanent managers - and arguably just one of those proved a mistake.\n\nSo, with various rivals constantly in managerial chaos, how do a club with one of the lowest budgets in the top flight - who have to deal with regularly losing their star players - keep getting it right with unproven appointments?\n\nDo they simply have the Midas touch in picking the right person, or is the manager just a smaller cog in a big machine?\n\nBrentford are renowned for their innovative, data-led approach under Benham, often defying conventional wisdom in search of an edge when it comes to recruitment and strategy,\n\nThey may have surprised some by naming the inexperienced Andrews as their boss, but it did not come as a shock for their own fans.\n\nBBC Sport fan writer and Brentford supporter Ian Westbrook said at the time of his appointment: \"While many were sceptical about the appointment of their set-piece coach Andrews as manager, having had no experience of being a boss previously, lots of Brentford fans were prepared to give the new man a chance.\n\n\"Matthew Benham and director of football Phil Giles have only made one bad managerial appointment in 10 years and they rectified that rapidly.\n\n\"Longer-term Brentford fans say everyone should 'trust the process' - and I do - but a good start is vital to ease any pressure from some fans and to give the squad a morale boost after a turbulent summer.\"\n\nA quick glance at the Benham era and you can see why fans should trust the process.\n\nIn 2011, the League One Bees gave Uwe Rosler his first taste of managing in English football. He got the club close to promotion before leaving for Wigan in 2013, where he was sacked after a year in charge.\n\nRosler was replaced as Brentford boss by the club's sporting director Mark Warburton - in his first managerial job. He led the Bees up to the Championship in his first year in charge before they lost in the play-off semi-finals in 2014-15.\n\nWarburton left the club at the end of that campaign and became Rangers boss. He led the Old Firm side back into Scotland's top flight, but has not had much success as a manager since leaving the Glasgow giants in 2017.\n\nWarburton's replacement at Brentford proved to be Benham's only blemish thus far. But the club acted quickly - sacking Marinus Dijkhuizen after just nine games of the 2015-16 season.\n\nFollowing a brief interim spell from future England Under-21s boss Lee Carsley, Dean Smith joined from League One Walsall to take the permanent reins at Brentford.\n\nSmith stabilised Brentford as a Championship club during his three-year stint before moving on to lead Aston Villa in the Premier League.\n\nHis assistant Frank stepped up to the top job at the Bees, securing promotion to the Premier League at the end of the 2020-21 season and helping establishing the club in the top flight during his seven years in charge.\n\nFrank's exit last summer paved the way for another internal appointment - and current boss Andrews has done a superb job thus far.\n\nFormer Brighton striker Glenn Murray told Football Focus: \"If the Premier League stopped right now, Keith Andrews would be manager of the season.\"\n\nHow Andrews has brought about Brentford's tactical evolution\n\nPremier League managerial rookies increasingly rare\n\nSo why do Benham and Brentford keep getting things so right?\n\nThe decision to appoint Andrews sums things up neatly.\n\nExternally it was viewed as a high-risk move, but internally it was seen as one of the lower-risk options.\n\nClub sources are wary of shouting about their success from the rooftops because nothing is certain in football, but their reasoning around Andrews taking over was rock solid.\n\nFirstly, he was already at the club. Senior staff knew him, they knew his strengths and weaknesses and what they were likely to get. He knew them. He understood the club model and had already bought into it.\n\nWhat Brentford do not want is a new manager who comes into the club and starts telling everyone what they view as the best way to run it.\n\nBrentford have a well-established model that has brought them success. There was no desire or intention to deviate from it. Having Andrews at the helm brought the continuity that guarded against a dramatic collapse.\n\nThat is not to say Andrews' presence is an irrelevance. On the contrary, the belief is he has done an excellent job and if he had not, the evidence would be clear.\n\nHowever, he has slotted into a well-established machine.\n\nContrast that with Frank at Tottenham, who followed on from Ange Postecoglou, Antonio Conte, Nuno Espirito Santo and Jose Mourinho.\n\nIt is fair to ask whether all those individuals failed through faults of their own - or did they struggle because of the lack of a wider strategy, given all five men approach the game in a different way?\n\nThe expectations at Brentford - who host Brighton on Saturday - are also totally different compared to Tottenham.\n\nFrank took over a side that had just won a major European competition and had ambitions to return to the level that produced 11 top-five finishes in the past 16 seasons.\n\nBrentford, by contrast, are already operating at a level higher than they have been for virtually their entire existence.\n\nNo club should be swayed by external noise, but it is easier when the messages coming back are supportive rather than hostile.\n\nEven after a tricky start to the season, when Brentford collected just four points from their opening five games and were 17th, fans were minded to trust those running the club rather than turn their ire on them.\n\nBut if it was that easy, everyone would do it. Wouldn't they?\n\nLatest Brentford news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Brentford - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "England batter Jos Buttler says he will not just bat for himself as he tries to correct a poor run of form at the T20 World Cup.\n\nButtler, arguably England's greatest white-ball batter, was out for three against Scotland and Italy and has not scored a fifty in 14 international innings this winter.\n\nAfter the 35-year-old was dismissed fourth ball looking to clear the infield for the second match in a row against Italy, former captain Nasser Hussain suggested Buttler should take time to build an innings.\n\nBut, speaking on his For the Love of Cricket podcast, external, Buttler said: \"I would love to just bat for 15 overs but I don't want to bat for 15 overs just for myself and ignore the game.\n\n\"You've got to still play the game.\n\n\"There are times I've been out of form in Test cricket and the batting coach might say 'rein it in and bat for an hour'.\n\n\"In T20 you have got to keep playing the scoreboard.\"\n\nIs Buttler's form a worry? England's T20 World Cup so far analysed\n\nButtler's last major contribution for England was 83 from 30 balls against South Africa in September but, given his illustrious career, his place in England's XI remains secure.\n\nHe scored 97 not out for Durban Super Giants in the SA20 in January but made 12, 20, 15, 22, three and one in his other innings there.\n\n\"I felt I was playing really well in the SA20 without getting scores,\" Buttler said. \"One thing I always pride myself on in T20 is if you get in, go and make a good contribution.\"\n\nButtler and England trained on Thursday for the first time since their win over Italy on Monday, after travelling to Sri Lanka.\n\nButtler had a lengthy regular net practice and then faced throw-downs from fielding coach Carl Hopkinson with a wet tennis ball on a soaked concrete strip - an apparent attempt to sharpen his reflexes.\n\nTeam-mate Jacob Bethell dismissed any doubts about the opener's form.\n\n\"He's fine,\" Bethell said. \"The options he has taken haven't come off but no one in that side is worried about Jos in terms of performance.\n\n\"He will come good when we need him in the big stages of this tournament.\"\n\nBethell trained with a bandage on a finger on his left hand. He suffered a cut during the defeat by West Indies and it has meant he has been unable to bowl.\n\nThe injury will be assessed again before England play co-hosts Sri Lanka in their first match of the Super 8s phase on Sunday in Pallekele.\n\nThey progressed through the group stage in unconvincing fashion with edgy wins over Italy, Scotland and Nepal, plus a defeat by West Indies, but before the World Cup they beat Sri Lanka 3-0 in a T20 series, with all three matches played in Pallekele.\n\n\"To beat a good Sri Lankan team at home in their conditions 3-0 was a massive confidence boost for us,\" Bethell said.\n\n\"You can feel it within the group the boys are confident coming back here.\n\n\"We know the conditions, we know how a couple of the teams are going to play.

    "fullText": "TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Even now, safely in her new home of Estonia, Inna Vnukova says she can’t purge the terrifying memory of living under Russian occupation in eastern Ukraine early in the war and her family’s harrowing escape.\n\nThey hid in a damp basement for days in their village of Kudriashivka after Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. In the streets, soldiers waving machine guns bullied residents, set up checkpoints and looted homes. There was constant shelling.\n\n“Everyone was very scared and afraid to go outside,” Vnukova told The Associated Press, with troops seeking out Ukrainian sympathizers and civil servants like her and her husband, Oleksii Vnukov.\n\nIn mid-March, she decided that she and her 16-year-old son, Zhenya, would flee the village with her brother's family, even though it meant leaving her husband behind temporarily. They took a risky trip by car to nearby Starobilsk, waving a white sheet amid mortar fire.\n\n“We had already said our goodbyes to life, cursing this Russian world,” said Vnukova, 42. “I’ve been trying to forget this nightmare for four years, but I can’t.”\n\nMany Ukrainians like Vnukova fled the invading forces. Those who stayed risked being detained — or worse — as Russian forces eventually took control of about 20% of the country and its estimated 3 million to 5 million people.\n\nAfter four years of war, life in shattered cities like Mariupol and villages like Kudriashivka remains difficult, with residents facing problems with housing, water, power, heat and health care. Even President Vladimir Putin has acknowledged they have “many truly pressing, urgent problems.\"\n\nIn the illegally annexed regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, Russian citizenship, language and culture is forced on residents, including in school lessons and textbooks. By spring 2025, some 3.5 million people in the four regions had been given Russian passports — a requirement to receive vital services like health care.\n\nSome in the regions say they live in fear of being accused of sympathizing with Ukraine. Many have been imprisoned, beaten and killed, according to human rights activists.\n\nOleksii Vnukov, a court security officer, stayed behind in the village for nearly two weeks. Russian soldiers twice threatened to kill him, including an instance where he and a friend were dragged off the street by soldiers. But he survived and soon also escaped the village.\n\nThe family traveled through Russia before making it to Estonia, where Inna works in a printing house and Oleksii, 43, is an electrician.\n\n“All life is leaving the occupied territories,” Vnukov said. “The people there aren’t living, they’re just surviving.”\n\nMykhailo Savva of the Center for Civil Liberties in Ukraine said the Russian military's practice of wielding “systemic and total control” in the regions continues today.\n\n“Even though a significant number of socially active people have already been detained, Russian special services continue to identify disloyal Ukrainians, extract confessions, and continue to detain people,” Savva said. “Residents face such practices as document checks, mass searches, and denunciations on a daily basis.”\n\nHuman rights groups say Russian authorities used “filtration camps” to identify potentially disloyal individuals, as well as anyone who worked for the government, helped the Ukrainian army or had relatives in the military, along with journalists, teachers, scientists and politicians.\n\nStanislav Shkuta, 25, who lived in occupied Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region, said he narrowly escaped arrest several times before reaching Ukrainian-controlled territory in 2023. He recalled being on a bus that was stopped by Russian soldiers.\n\n“It was horrific. Men and women were asked to strip to the waist to see if they had Ukrainian tattoos,” said Shkuta, who now lives in Estonia. “I turned white with fear, wondering if I’d cleared everything on my phone.”\n\nHe said his friends who stayed in Nova Kakhovka say life has worsened, with suspected Ukrainian sympathizers stopped on the street or in surprise door-to-door inspections.\n\n“Today, my friends complain that life there has become impossible,” he said.\n\nRussia established a “vast network of secret and official detention centers where tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians” are held indefinitely without charge, said Oleksandra Matviichuk, head of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Center for Civil Liberties.\n\n“Everyone knows that if you end up in the basement, your life is worth nothing,” she said.\n\nRussian officials have refused to comment on past allegations by U.N. human rights officials that it tortures civilians and prisoners of war.\n\nAbout 16,000 civilians have been detained illegally, but that number could be much higher because many are held incommunicado. said Ukrainian Human Rights Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets.\n\nA U.N. report released last summer said that between July 2024 and June 2025, it spoke to 57 civilians who were detained in the occupied regions, and that 52 of them told of severe beatings, electric shocks, sexual violence, degradation and threats of violence.\n\nOne particularly famous case is that of Ukrainian journalist Victoria Roshchyna, 27, who disappeared in 2023 while reporting near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and died in Russian custody. When her body was handed over to Ukraine in 2025, it bore signs of torture, with some of her organs removed, a prosecutor said.\n\n“Russia uses terror in the occupied territories to physically eliminate active people working in certain fields: teachers, children’s writers, musicians, mayors, journalists, environmentalists. It also intimidates the passive majority,” Matviichuk says.\n\nAt the start of the war, Russian forces besieged Mariupol before the port city fell in May 2022. The Russian bombing of the Donetsk Academic Regional Drama Theater on March 16 of that year killed close to 600 people in and around the building, an AP investigation found, in the single deadliest known attack against civilians in the war.\n\nMost of the city's population of about a half-million fled but many hid in basements, said a former actor who huddled for months with his parents, saying they were nearly killed by the Russian bombing.\n\nThe former actor, now in Estonia, spoke on condition of anonymity to not endanger his 76-year-old parents, still in Mariupol. They had to take Russian citizenship to get medical care, as well as a one-time payment equivalent to $1,300 per person as compensation for their destroyed home, he said.\n\nAs in other occupied cities, Russification is taking place in Mariupol, changing street names, teaching Moscow-approved curriculum in schools, using Russian phone and TV networks and putting the city in Moscow's time zone.\n\n“But even today, the threat of death has not gone away. Only those who have Russian passports can survive,″ the former actor said, adding that his parents have asked him not to send postcards in Ukrainian because “it could be dangerous.”\n\nPutin \"openly states that there is no Ukrainian language, no Ukrainian culture, no Ukrainian nation. And in the occupied territories, these words are turning into terrible practice,” Matviichuk said.\n\nBut not everyone opposes the Russian takeover in Mariupol. The former actor says half of the members of his old troupe now support the Kremlin and believe Kyiv “provoked the war.”\n\nHousing is a sore point in Mariupol, where the population is about half of what it was before 2022. New apartment blocks rose from the ruins, but rather than going to those who lost their homes, they are sold to Russian newcomers.\n\nSome who lost their homes have made video appeals to Putin. “You said we ‘don’t abandon our own.’ Do we not count as your own?” said one resident at a mass rally.\n\nAt least 12,191 apartments in Mariupol were added to a list of purportedly “ownerless” and abandoned flats to be expropriated in the first half of 2025. Thousands more are being seized elsewhere.\n\nMoscow is encouraging Russian citizens to move to the occupied regions, offering a range of benefits. Teachers, doctors and cultural workers are promised salary supplements if they commit to living there for five years.\n\nYears of war and neglect have saddled many occupied cities in eastern Ukraine with serious problems in supplying heat, electricity and water.\n\nThe northeastern city of Sievierodonetsk suffered significant destruction before falling to Russia in June 2022. Once home to 140,000 people, only 45,000 remain, mostly elderly or disabled.\n\nOnly one ambulance crew serves the whole city, and doctors and other health workers rotate in from Russian regions like Perm to work at its hospital, said a 67-year-old former engineer who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nBut she still supports “the great work Putin is doing,” because she was born and raised in the former Soviet Union.\n\nIn Alchevsk, a city in the Luhansk region, over half the homes have been without heat for two bitterly cold months. Five warming stations have been set up and utility companies said over 60% of municipal heating networks are in poor shape, without funds for repairs.\n\nEven a pro-Moscow politician, Oleg Tsaryov, has accused authorities of freezing “an entire city.” When the heating system failed in 2006, he noted on social media that Ukrainian authorities \"and the entire country stepped in to help and completely replaced the faulty equipment.” But after the Russian takeover, officials had “contrived to repeat this Armageddon scenario all over again,” he added.\n\nIn the Donetsk region, water trucks fill barrels outside apartment blocks — but they freeze solid in winter, said a resident who spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared repercussions.\n\n“There's constant squabbling over water,” she said, adding that lines to get the precious resource are “insane,” and people who are away at work often miss the trucks' arrival.\n\nDonetsk residents wrote an appeal for Putin to intervene in what has become \"a humanitarian and environmental catastrophe.”\n\nPutin last year acknowledged the plight in the four regions.\n\n“I know how difficult it is now for the residents of the liberated cities and towns. There are many truly pressing, urgent problems,\" he said, marking the third anniversary of incorporating those areas into Russia. He cited the need for reliable water supplies and access to health care, among other issues, and said he has launched a \"large-scale socioeconomic development program” for the regions.\n\nMeanwhile, Inna Vnukova is building a new life in Estonia: She and Oleksii now have a 1-year-old daughter, Alisa. Their son is now 20.\n\nOnly about 150 people — including the couple's parents — remain in the village that once was home to 800, Vnukova said, adding that she would like to show her daughter the family's native Luhansk region someday.\n\n“We’ve been dreaming of returning for four years, but we increasingly wonder — what will we see there?” she asked.\n\nKatie Marie Davies in Manchester, England, contributed.",

It's important to have a core together to build something around.\"\n\nRohl has injuries to contend with this weekend and suggested there would be \"two or three changes\".\n\nHowever, midfielder Connor Barron and defender Derek Cornelius are making progress in their returns to fitness and could feature in March.",

    "description": "Captain Maro Itoje will become the ninth men's player to reach 100 caps for England on Saturday against Ireland - here are five moments that made the England centurion.",
    "fullText": "Captain Maro Itoje will become the ninth men's player to play 100 times for England when they face Ireland on Saturday.\n\nThe 31-year-old, who made his international debut in 2016, will lead out his team at a packed Allianz Stadium to mark the milestone, although his path has not always been straightforward.\n\nHere are some of the key moments that have brought him to this point.\n\nHaving captained England Under-20s to a world title in 2014 and been part of the 2015 Rugby World Cup training squad, Itoje was as bright a young prospect as they come.\n\nAn inevitable England debut followed at the age of 21 against Italy in the 2016 Six Nations.\n\nAfter an impactful appearance off the bench, the Saracens lock started the next game against Ireland.\n\n\"I thought I was ready in 2015 but there was probably still a gap and in hindsight not getting picked for the World Cup was the biggest blessing for me,\" Itoje told BBC Rugby Union Weekly.\n\n\"It gave me the extra motivation to knuckle down and work. Slowly but surely I closed the gap.\n\n\"The summer of 2015 to January 2016 I came on heaps. Maybe I was ready, but by 2016 I was ready to go.\"\n\nItoje went on to start the rest of the championship, winning player of the match against Wales in round four.\n\nHis first Six Nations campaign ended with a Grand Slam in Paris – not a bad way to begin an international career.\n\nItoje's rise may have been expected, but it was also rapid.\n\nAt 22, he became the youngest player selected to tour New Zealand with the British and Irish Lions in 2017.\n\nThe chant of \"oh, Maro Itoje\" - a tune inspired by the White Stripes - echoed around stadiums, boosting his popularity throughout the tour.\n\nA strong performance off the bench in the first Test defeat earned Itoje a starting place alongside Alun Wyn Jones for the must-win second Test in Wellington.\n\nIn one of the Lions' greatest Test performances Itoje was named player of the match, and his chant rang out across Wellington.\n\nThe Lions drew the series a week later, with Itoje leaving New Zealand as a household name in the rugby world.\n\n'A lightning rod for excitement' - Pollock gets start\n\nArundell to start against Ireland after red card\n\nUnder-20 star, England debutant, Grand Slam winner, Test Lion.\n\nItoje's career arc accelerated into stardom and, for a time, bordered on perfection.\n\nBut in 2018, a dip in form was attributed to \"second-season syndrome\" by England coach Eddie Jones, with the lock failing to live up to his own high standards during the Six Nations.\n\n\"It was crazy, as you get in and win everything straight away - so you think this is going to happen every year,\" Itoje said.\n\n\"Rugby has a way of bringing you back down to earth.\"\n\nThe only box left to tick on his CV was a Rugby World Cup, and he needed to rediscover his form quickly.\n\nA standout 2019 World Cup campaign saw Itoje play every minute of the knockout stages, including the famous semi-final victory over New Zealand.\n\nFlanker Sam Underhill was named player of the match, but Itoje also delivered a relentless performance.\n\nEngland went on to lose the final to South Africa, yet Itoje had shown he could respond to adversity.\n\nSaracens were relegated from the Premiership at the end of the 2019–20 season following persistent salary cap breaches, bringing more adversity for Itoje to contend with.\n\nHaving won three Champions Cups and four Premiership titles by the age of 25, his decision to remain loyal and help the club return to the top of English rugby could have affected his England career.\n\nHe was named in reports as one of the players whose business ventures with Saracens owner Nigel Wray fell foul of rules restricting spending on players - something he was not aware of.\n\nHe remained a regular for England in 2020–21, while also playing a key role in Saracens' victories over Ealing Trailfinders to secure promotion from the Championship.\n\nDespite playing considerably less rugby, Itoje was selected again for the Lions in 2021 and impressed, being named the team's player of the series in a 2–1 defeat in South Africa. The risk had paid off.\n\nIn 2023, an underlying health issue during the Six Nations led to some below-par performances from Itoje.\n\n\"I had something structurally wrong and I didn't know it was structurally wrong until I was quite deep into it,\" he said.\n\n\"To be able to persevere through that period and finally get a fix for that was great.\"\n\nAs he had four years earlier, Itoje rediscovered his form to help England finish third at the 2023 World Cup.\n\n\"I have had a silver and bronze medal, I am desperate for a gold and I think we are capable of achieving that,\" he said.\n\n\"It is a dream to play in a World Cup and win one.\"\n\nHaving captained England Under-20s to a world title and established himself as a central figure in the senior side, Itoje was long viewed as a future Test captain.\n\nYet it was not until 2024 that he took on the captaincy at Saracens, following Owen Farrell's move to French side Racing 92.\n\nJones had questioned whether Itoje was suited to the role in a 2021 book, describing the second row as \"very inward-looking\" and suggesting he did not \"usually influence people off the field\".\n\nItoje's interests extend beyond rugby. They include philanthropy, politics - where he has launched a podcast - business and art, with his faith a significant influence on his life.\n\n\"I try to have a daily amount of time that I spend, whether that is reading the Bible or praying, ideally both,\" he explained.\n\nHe succeeded Jamie George as England captain last year and ended the season by leading the Lions to a series victory in Australia.\n\nIn the space of less than a year, he went from not captaining a senior side to leading three different teams.\n\nSaturday 21 February at 14:10 GMT\n\nListen to live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live & BBC Sounds with live text updates on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nSix Nations: All about Ireland with Conor Murray\n\nCrowley recalled as Ireland make five changes\n\nItoje has had a stop-start season in 2025-26, featuring in all four autumn internationals but sustaining an injury in the last of those, against Argentina.\n\nHe also missed the start of the Six Nations training camp in Girona to attend his mother Florence's funeral in Nigeria, before coming off the bench in the opening win over Wales.\n\n\"We will miss my mother's presence, she would have loved this, but she will be there in spirit, shouting from the heavens,\" the England captain added.\n\nItoje has proven he can rediscover his form and fitness to deliver when it matters most.\n\nSaturday's must-win game against Ireland, to keep championship dreams alive, demands exactly that.\n\n\"He is a fantastic leader, great to coach and has grown into the role as captain,\" England coach Kevin Sinfield told BBC Sport.",

But I love the sport.\"\n\nBare-knuckle boxer Liam Rees is aware of the dangers when he steps onto the canvas.\n\nThe Welshman juggles his day job as a carpenter with the demands of a sport so visibly brutal it has stayed in the shadows of combat sports for much of its existence.\n\nSlumped in a chair moments after losing his light-middleweight world title at the Vale Sport Arena, Cardiff, the Swansea native's wife Emma gently implores her bloodied partner to give up the sport.\n\nBut nothing can replace the buzz for him.\n\n\"You've got so much adrenaline pumping through your body in that ring,\" he tells BBC Sport.\n\nAt licensed bare-knuckle events, fighters go toe-to-toe on surfaces half the size of a professional gloved boxing ring - which means there is nowhere to hide.\n\nThere are more cuts, bruises and knockouts - which is exactly the appeal for some fans.\n\nAfter overcoming substance-abuse issues, the 31-year-old was introduced to the emerging combat sport by a trainer in his boxing gym.\n\nHe made his bare-knuckle boxing debut in 2023, going on to become a two-time light-middleweight world champion in BKB.\n\nDuring camp, Rees trains three times a day, five days a week, forgoing seeing his two children on weekdays.\n\nHe does not earn enough from the sport to quit his carpentry business. His goal is to leave a \"legacy, just to prove to the city I've done something for them\".\n\nBare-knuckle is the oldest form of boxing but became associated with unlicensed fights on wastelands after The Marquess of Queensberry rules were introduced in 1867, which insisted on gloves.\n\nHowever, in the past decade, licensed events have grown. As per data from BoxRec, there were only 21 licensed bare-knuckle bouts in 2015. Last year, the figure was more than 1,000 across 21 countries.\n\nRees fights under the banner of Bare Knuckle Boxing (BKB) promotions – one of two major international promotions who host licensed bouts, alongside US-based Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship (BKFC).\n\nAttendances at BKB venues are capped at 2,000 and the organisation's president David Tetreault says they generally sell out.\n\nBroadcast in more than 60 countries, BKB has partnerships with the likes of VICE TV and TalkSport.\n\nRetired boxing world champions Lee Selby, Paulie Malignaggi and James DeGale have all crossed into bare-knuckle boxing as the popularity grows.\n\nHowever, Luke Griggs, chief executive of brain injury charity Headway, said he is \"hugely concerned\" about its rise and the \"glamourisation of a sport that's going to be taken out into the streets\".\n\nIn a new film, BBC Sport investigates the realities of a sport that is slowly becoming more popular, and the people at the heart of it.\n\nGloves are off - the rise of bare-knuckle boxing\n\nIt was only in 2018 that the first sanctioned bare-knuckle bout for 130 years took place in the US state of Wyoming.\n\nThe US has seen the biggest growth in the sport. There were at least 65 events in the States in 2025. The UK is second, with 31 events last year.\n\nTetreault told BBC Sport that 90% of BKB bouts end in knockout or technical knockout and claimed that the fast nature of the sport appeals particularly to Gen Z and millennial fans.\n\nSome 50% of their audience on social media fall into those younger demographics.\n\nWhen Malignaggi defeated Tyler Goodjohn by split decision at the John Charles Centre for Sport in Leeds last October, the crowd was studded with boxing luminaries, including former multiple super-middleweight world champion Carl Froch, former two-time featherweight world champion Josh Warrington and former two-weight world champion Natasha Jonas.\n\n\"It's a blood sport, people do have a blood thirst to watch this sport,\" Malignaggi says.\n\n\"It's more action packed and I think the misconceptions are going to slowly go away once people watch it more and more.\"\n\nJonas says she was \"impressed by the set-up\", but doubts she will ever compete in it.\n\nBoxing promoter Eddie Hearn says while there is clearly an audience for the sport, \"it's a little bit barbaric for me, I am a boxing purist\".\n\n'Entertaining' or 'irresponsible'? The rise of bare-knuckle boxing\n\nAn inside look at what it's like to fight in bare-knuckle fight\n\nAlthough bare-knuckle boxing seems more brutal than its gloved counterpart, Tetreault claims that there are misconceptions.\n\n\"The fighters have to be taking care of their hands. They can't hit as hard,\" he said.\n\nWhereas professional gloved boxing events involve a maximum of 12, three-minute rounds, in BKB, bouts are capped at a maximum of six, three-minute rounds while BKFC bouts involve two-minute rounds.\n\nTetreault cites the shorter duration of bare-knuckle fights as another mitigating factor when answering safety concerns.\n\n\"The difference is it's not the continual punching,\" he said.\n\nDr. Louis Durkin, president of the Association of Ringside Physicians, who is also a stitch doctor for BKB, shared data from a study conducted by the ARP in 2025. It looked at 2,000 fighters across BKB and BKFC and compared the rates of injury with previously conducted studies from gloved boxing and MMA.\n\nThe study found that the percentage of concussions was lower in bare-knuckle boxing (5% in BKFC and 4.76% in BKB) than gloved boxing (12%) and MMA (14.7%).\n\nConversely, there was a much higher rate of laceration found in bare-knuckle boxing (34.3% in BKFC and 35.9% in BKB) than gloved boxing (8.7%) and MMA (13.5%).\n\nHowever, consultant neurosurgeon Peter Hamlyn says there is a lack of data in general in bare-knuckle boxing.\n\n\"Hitting someone with equal power with an ungloved fist delivers more energy to the head, more brain injury,\" he explained.\n\n\"However, you've then got all those confounding factors - it hurts your hands, so you tend to hold back a bit, and there is the number of blows that are landed, the number of rounds.\n\n\"When you add that all together, you end up actually with a conclusion that reads something like, 'I don't know'.\"\n\nHamlyn also mentioned that it is difficult to make conclusive judgements on brain injury in the short term.\n\n\"The difficulty we've had in sport is that that data doesn't emerge until they're in their later life,\" he said.\n\n\"If you're deliberately trying to cause a brain injury in order to win a bout, that can't be right,\" Griggs said.\n\nThe first BKB event of 2026 will take place at London's Indigo on 21 February.\n\n\"Part of what we're doing in 2026 is we're going to be coming to the bigger cities,\" Tetreault said.\n\nHe is convinced that bare-knuckle boxing can go mainstream.\n\n\"We're seeing it with our ticket sales,\" he reasoned. \"We're seeing it with our ratings. Part of our roadmap is building out bigger mega fights with some star power.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rees' future in the sport is uncertain. Since losing his title to Filipino former UFC fighter Rolando Dy, he says he is in \"semi-retirement\".\n\n\"Bare-knuckle's a full-time job,\" he said.\n\n\"I've missed out on too much of my kids' lives. I'd love to get involved again, but we'll see.\n\n\"Let's say I'm on a long vacation at the minute.\"\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "There was a backlash when No 10 invited online content creators inside its doors. But in a fast-changing media landscape, this solves two problems at once\n\nLast year, No 10 took an unprecedented step: it invited content creators to cross the threshold of Downing Street.\n\nNaturally, the creators all filmed themselves outside the famous door. Once inside, their most treasured possessions, their phones, were taken from them and exchanged for government-approved devices, so they could continue to take photos and record video without breaching security guidelines. At the reception, creators from areas as wide as science, education and travel took part in a networking session at the heart of government.\n\nThis was one of a number of events in 2025. There were also off-the-record breakfasts to talk about how creators might collaborate with the government to reach new and younger audiences. A large part of the work being done by No 10’s New Media Unit was aimed at working with financial education creators to help share new policies being launched by the Treasury.\n\nFinancial content creators were invited to speeches and briefings for the biggest political events of the year. When Anna Brading, a personal finance content creator, entered the No 10 briefing room for the spring statement, she could hardly believe it. Having three kids at a young age meant that she spent her time raising a family and making ends meet by tutoring maths on the side. As she managed her family’s money, she began posting tips online for other mums. Now she was in the room that public health experts had updated the public from during the pandemic. “The day I walked in that room, I had to take a minute,” she says.\n\nThis article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'.\n\nThere was, of course, a backlash as some journalists felt that these creators didn’t have the expertise or clout to hold the government to account, but this may be one of the few areas in which No 10 is getting it right. The unit is attempting to address two unavoidable truths: one, people don’t trust politicians; two, more people are now getting their news from content platforms. Using highly trusted content creators to share news of policies addresses both of these issues at once.\n\nFinancial educator Rotimi Merriman-Johnson, known as Mr MoneyJar, has recorded videos for policies such as changes to the minimum wage for young people. He began making content before training as a financial adviser, and is keen to emphasise that it’s not just about relaying any old information. It’s about consistently sharing quality information that makes a difference to people’s pockets. “Every additional year you spend as a content creator, you become more trusted … It’s not just about the information, it’s about the person sharing the information.”\n\nPolitical journalists, known as lobby journalists, have been permitted to work in parliament since the 1870s, sit in the press gallery watching the Commons floor, and receive briefings from the prime minister’s communication staff. The walls of the room where these briefings happen are lined with now-defunct telephone booths designed to allow reporters to file their copy down the phone. Desks in the members’ lobby, the room in which MPs gather before entering the Commons chamber, are pitted with now-dry ink wells. The bowels of Westminster are knotted with internet cables that sit – quite precariously – on top of old steam pipes. Inviting creators into the heart of government is yet another iteration of British politics and its institutions responding to technological innovation.\n\nSince their introduction more than 20 years ago, social media sites have evolved into “content platforms”. Once, Myspace, Facebook et al were spaces to connect with friends; with the advent of Instagram, they became places to follow lifestyle “influencers”; now they are platforms that host a never-ending stream of “content”. Some of the best creators lean hard into specialisms and niches, and present themselves as experts in specific areas. According to Diane Banks, the chief executive of talent management agency Northbank Talent: “We are in the age of the expert content creator.”\n\nIn many ways, these expert creators are the perfect interlocutors for the Starmer government: they are technocratic and emphatically apolitical. As creator Cameron Smith says: “When I go into these rooms I’m representing my audience’s interests, not the interests of these political parties.” In fact, being non-ideological is integral to the business model. Talent management agencies shy away from polemicists as they are difficult to monetise. Brands don’t like to work with opinions. In this sense, the UK is treading a different path from the US, as the White House has seen an exodus of mainstream reporters who are being replaced by regime-friendly influencers and commentators.\n\nOf course, the creators acknowledge the tension between pushing politicians on issues their audiences may be facing and needing to maintain access. This is especially pressing at a time when so many people feel knots tighten in their stomachs whenever they check their bank balances. There are more than a dozen major news publications in the UK, but millions of individual creators. It’s hard for a government to ignore – to pick an example out of nowhere – the Guardian for long, but easy to cast aside a creator who isn’t playing ball.\n\nCreator Mat Gay says: “It’s a difficult question because while I would love to push a bit harder and talk a little bit more about the things that people are worrying about, to me it’s more important to just get them to the table.” Gabriel Nussbaum believes things are shifting. “They were a little bit rigid at the start,” he says. “They said: ‘Can you submit five questions that you’d want to ask Rachel Reeves?’, for example. And then they’d come back and say: ‘Do you mind not asking question four and five?’” But now, he finds he is given the freedom to question politicians. A government spokesperson said: “We are engaging with content creators, as well as journalists to reach new audiences, ensure we are held to account in a changing media landscape and keep the public better informed about government policies.”\n\nTalking to these creators, I get the sense that they’re diligent and dutiful to their audiences, focused on the policy rather than the politics. Rather than political journalists, they seem to have \n\nKirsty Major is a deputy Opinion editor for the Guardian",

    "fullText": "The updated QuickShot II brings retro gameplay into the modern era while preserving the no-frills button smashing and endearing flaws that fans loved\n\nNostalgia is big in the modern games industry. It’s ironic that the most technologically obsessed art form on the planet is just as watery-eyed about the past as cinema and music. And to prove it here is the new version of the legendary QuickShot II, a plasticky joystick from the early 1980s that wasn’t even that good the first time round. It was, however, cheap and it resembled an actual fighter plane control stick with its multiple fire buttons and ergonomic shaft. If you wanted a rugged and precise controller you’d go for the Competition Pro, but that one didn’t let you pretend to be in Star Wars or Airwolf. Plus, the QuickShot II had suckers on its base so you could stick it to your cockpit control panel – sorry, I mean MDF computer table.\n\nThe new QuickShot II from Retro Games and Plaion Replai is almost an exact replica in terms of its dimensions. You can grasp it in your fist and wrap your thumb and forefinger around its large red buttons. Yes, you can stick it to your table; the designers have even included the original auto-fire switch at the rear for players who weren’t prepared to hit the fire button repeatedly while playing Green Beret.\n\nIt has been tastefully updated, though. The two fire buttons on the stick can now be separately configured – a feature I yearned for as a young Commodore 64 fanatic so that I could independently control the laser and bombs in Skramble. There are also six buttons on the base, which align with standard joypad layouts, and the USB cable means you can plug it into a PC or any of the modern computer remakes released by Retro Games, such as the C64 or Spectrum. I tested it with the latter and have already spent many hours blasting through Ant Attack, Pheenix and Head over Heels.\n\nIn terms of build quality, it’s a good balance of necessary updates and respectful nonaction. The stick itself has plenty of travel (you have to push it quite far to register movement), which is just as I remember. This made the QuickShot famously unsuitable for joystick-waggling titles such as Daley Thompson’s Decathlon as you had to move it a long way left and right, often causing damage to the joystick and indignity to yourself. At least now the designers have added microswitches so you get a nice click when the stick moves. The fire buttons, however, still have the same old soft click, and the sound and feel of them is one of the most warmly nostalgic parts of the whole thing. I spent so many hours of my teen years pressing those buttons – the sound is as hardwired into my memory as the smell of school dinners or the wash of the ocean against a pier.\n\nI also tried the QuickShot II with Steam and it worked absolutely fine after some simple calibration – although the auto-fire proved problematic. It was lovely to play the Steam version of classic shooter Truxton with this stick, returning me to memories of playing arcade games in Blackpool then going home and pretending my computer desk and joystick were an arcade cabinet. You think these feelings are gone but it doesn’t take much to bring them hurtling back – sometimes just a hunk of plastic will do it.\n\nIf you’re looking for a serious modern joystick, this isn’t it. It’s low-budget and awkward and, despite an hour of configuring, I couldn’t get it to work with PC emulation platform RetroArch, which was a shame, though others may manage it. But this is the point: the QuickShot II was not the best joystick, it was the one we could afford. And it looked cool.\n\nI respect that the remake is true to that spirit. It is affordable and a little compromised. But if you owned one back in the day, it is a fun thing to have, and the fourth star in my review is for the absolute raw nostalgia of it. Every time I see it sitting there beside my hi-tech PC and big HD monitor, I smile. It’s good to have you back, old friend, with all your flaws and shortcomings.",

    "description": "Exclusive: England and Wales charity to examine safeguards after Guardian exposed ‘very dangerous’ advice on Google AI...",
    "fullText": "Exclusive: England and Wales charity to examine safeguards after Guardian exposed ‘very dangerous’ advice on Google AI Overviews\n\n‘Very dangerous’: a Mind mental health expert on Google’s AI summaries\n\nMind is launching a significant inquiry into artificial intelligence and mental health after a Guardian investigation exposed how Google’s AI Overviews gave people “very dangerous” medical advice.\n\nIn a year-long commission, the mental health charity, which operates in England and Wales, will examine the risks and safeguards required as AI increasingly influences the lives of millions of people affected by mental health issues worldwide.\n\nThe inquiry – the first of its kind globally – will bring together the world’s leading doctors and mental health professionals, as well as people with lived experience, health providers, policymakers and tech companies. Mind says it will aim to shape a safer digital mental health ecosystem, with strong regulation, standards and safeguards.\n\nThe launch comes after the Guardian revealed how people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google AI Overviews. The AI-generated summaries are shown to 2 billion people a month, and appear above traditional search results on the world’s most visited website.\n\nAfter the reporting, Google removed AI Overviews for some but not all medical searches. Dr Sarah Hughes, chief executive officer of Mind, said “dangerously incorrect” mental health advice was still being provided to the public. In the worst cases, the bogus information could put lives at risk, she said.\n\nHughes said: “We believe AI has enormous potential to improve the lives of people with mental health problems, widen access to support, and strengthen public services. But that potential will only be realised if it is developed and deployed responsibly, with safeguards proportionate to the risks.\n\n“The issues exposed by the Guardian’s reporting are among the reasons we’re launching Mind’s commission on AI and mental health, to examine the risks, opportunities and safeguards needed as AI becomes more deeply embedded in everyday life.\n\n“We want to ensure that innovation does not come at the expense of people’s wellbeing, and that those of us with lived experience of mental health problems are at the heart of shaping the future of digital support.”\n\nGoogle has said its AI Overviews, which use generative AI to provide snapshots of essential information about a topic or question, are “helpful” and “reliable”.\n\nBut the Guardian found some AI Overviews served up inaccurate health information and put people at risk of harm. The investigation uncovered false and misleading medical advice across a range of issues, including cancer, liver disease and women’s health, as well as mental health conditions.\n\nExperts said some AI Overviews for conditions such as psychosis and eating disorders offered “very dangerous advice” and were “incorrect, harmful or could lead people to avoid seeking help”.\n\nGoogle is also downplaying safety warnings that its AI-generated medical advice may be wrong, the Guardian found.\n\nHughes said vulnerable people were being served “dangerously incorrect guidance on mental health”, including “advice that could prevent people from seeking treatment, reinforce stigma or discrimination and in the worst cases, put lives at risk”.\n\nShe added: “People deserve information that is safe, accurate and grounded in evidence, not untested technology presented with a veneer of confidence.”\n\nIf you have something to share about this story, you can contact Andrew using one of the following methods.\n\nThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories. Messages are end to end encrypted and concealed within the routine activity that every Guardian mobile app performs. This prevents an observer from knowing that you are communicating with us at all, let alone what is being said.\n\nIf you don’t already have the Guardian app, download it (iOS/Android) and go to the menu. Select ‘Secure Messaging’.\n\nIf you don’t need a high level of security or confidentiality you can email andrew.gregory@theguardian.com\n\nSecureDrop and other secure methods\n\nIf you can safely use the tor network without being observed or monitored you can send messages and documents to the Guardian via our SecureDrop platform.\n\nFinally, our guide at theguardian.com/tips lists several ways to contact us securely, and discusses the pros and cons of each.\n\nThe commission, which will run for a year, will gather evidence on the intersection of AI and mental health, and provide an “open space” where the experience of people with mental health conditions will be “seen, recorded and understood”.\n\nRosie Weatherley, information content manager at Mind, said that although Googling mental health information “wasn’t perfect” before AI Overviews, it usually worked well. She said: “Users had a good chance of clicking through to a credible health website that answered their query, and then went further – offering nuance, lived experience, case studies, quotes, social context and an onward journey to support.\n\n“AI Overviews replaced that richness with a clinical-sounding summary that gives an illusion of definitiveness. They give the user more of one form of clarity (brevity and plain English), while giving them less of another form of clarity (security in the source of the information, and how much to trust it). It’s a very seductive swap, but not a responsible one.”\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information.\n\n“For queries where our systems identify a person might be in distress, we work to display relevant, local crisis hotlines. Without being able to review the examples referenced, we can’t comment on their accuracy.”",

    "fullText": "Jose Alvarado gives brutally honest answer on Pistons' regular season sweep over Knicks originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Knicks suffered their third loss of the season to the Detroit Pistons on Thursday night, a regular-season sweep from their Eastern Conference Rivals.\n\nThe biggest problem is that New York hasn't been competitive in all three games against Detroit, losing Thursday night's matchup by 15, January 5's by 31, and February 6's by 28. It's a troubling sign for a team that's supposed to be a top contender in the East.\n\nBut it seems the Knicks aren't worried, though, and recent trade acquisition Jose Alvarado downplayed the regular-season series sweep in his media availability after the game.\n\n\"Playoffs is a whole different ball game,\" Alvarado told reporters. \"I mean, we're not gonna sit here and say, just because they beat us in regular season, we can't, we're not thinking like that, I don't think like that. So, I mean, when it counts, that's when it matters, so we're gonna play like that.\"\n\nEven though Alvarado is a new addition to this Knicks team, this isn't new for these guys, especially dating back to last season.\n\nThroughout the 2024-2025 season, New York was swept by both the Boston Celtics and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the regular season. The Knicks didn't end up playing Cleveland in the postseason, but took down Boston in six games in the Eastern Conference Semifinals.\n\nIf anything, Knicks fans, this is a good sign of things to come in the postseason. If history repeats itself, New York will have a shot at taking down Detroit in the postseason if the two franchises meet.\n\nThough it's important to note that those were Tom Thibodeau's Knicks teams. We'll see if Mike Brown has what it takes to ensure his team turns it up a notch once the playoffs roll around.\n\nKnicks new addition Jeremy Sochan expected to eat into minutes of fan-favorite rookie\n\nJalen Brunson reveals honest thoughts on latest Knicks addition Jeremy Sochan\n\nGuerschon Yabusele did Knicks major favor to complete Bulls trade\n\nJalen Brunson pushes back on idea that Eastern Conference is 'wide open'",

    "fullText": "For the first time in his NBA career, Chicago Bulls guard Jaden Ivey finished a game with a “DNP — coach’s decision” next to his name in the box score.\n\nThe guard did not play in Thursday’s 110-101 loss to the Toronto Raptors at the United Center despite not being listed on the injury report. Acting coach Wes Unseld Jr. said Ivey’s absence was purely a basketball decision, but the guard alluded to lingering knee soreness as a partial cause for the healthy scratch. Ivey said he is still practicing fully despite the injury and believes he is fully available to play.\n\n“I’m sure people can call it out that I’m not the same player as I used to be,” Ivey, 24, said. “That’s why. I’m not the JI I used to be. But the old JI is dead. I’m alive in Christ. … No matter how many DNP’s I don’t get to play or no matter how many points I score, those things are a temporary thing.”\n\nThis could be a new status quo for the Bulls, whose roster includes six guards. Unseld spoke with the team at shootaround Thursday morning to address the reality that players might see a reduction in their minutes as the team attempts to figure out healthy rotations. The decision was made in conjunction with coach Billy Donovan, who was not with the team following the death of his father.\n\nBut Ivey said he was not informed heading into the game that he would not play at all against the Raptors.\n\n“Obviously going into it you’ve got to look at who’s on the roster,” Ivey said. “This team has a lot of guards, so going into it I’m kind of just thrown in. I do my job to the glory of God so I’m ready for whenever my name is called. Whenever (the) coach needs me, calls my name, I’ll be out there to play. Getting traded, that’s what happens in the NBA. You get traded, the organization figures out what the team needs and they make their adjustments.”\n\nSixteen days ago, Ivey was logging 16.8 minutes per game for the best team in the East. The Bulls traded for him with the intention of investing in his future as a young playmaker. And Ivey had been decently productive in his first four games with the Bulls, averaging 11.5 points and four assists. He joked about his hefty workload after playing 33 minutes in his debut against the Raptors on Feb. 5 and averaged 28.8 minutes for the Bulls before the All-Star break.\n\nAs a restricted free agent this summer, Ivey is not guaranteed to return to Chicago for the 2026-27 season. But the Bulls have been publicly insistent that they plan to test out every player they acquired at the deadline as a potential option to be re-signed in the offseason.\n\nIvey shied away from expressing how Thursday’s game — or further lack of playing time — could affect his feelings toward the Bulls in free agency, repeatedly turning to his faith as a guiding post among uncertainty on the court.\n\n“I don’t really trust the NBA setting,” Ivey said. “I trust the Lord. That’s the main thing. He places me where I need to be. … When moves are made behind the scenes of trades and stuff, I don’t trust that part. You can’t trust it, because it’s not in your hands. It’s not in my hands to make moves or trade myself or put myself in a certain position. I leave that up to the Lord.”\n\nWho are the 7 new Chicago Bulls? Meet Jaden Ivey, Anfernee Simons and the rest of the deadline additions.\n\nThursday marked a season-high-tying seventh consecutive loss in their first game back from the All-Star break. Despite forcing a clutch finish with a 7-0 run in the final stretch of the fourth quarter, the Bulls couldn’t fend off a 31-point game from Brandon Ingram, who knocked down a dagger 3-pointer with 35.5 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Bulls have lost 10 of their last 11 games, a result directly tied to their decision to dump the majority of their players on expiring contracts at the trade deadline. And the schedule will only get harder this weekend when the Bulls host a home back-to-back against the Detroit Pistons and the New York Knicks.\n\nHere are three more takeaways from the loss.\n\nUnseld helmed the Bulls for the game in the stead of coach Billy Donovan, who was away from the team to spend time with his family after the death of his father, Bill Donovan Sr.\n\nThe elder Donovan died Saturday at age 85. He was a member of the Boston College Hall of Fame after captaining the team and graduating in 1962 as the program’s third-leading scorer.\n\nDonovan Jr. is expected to return Friday to Chicago and could resume his coaching duties for this weekend’s back-to-back.\n\nThe Bulls returned to a vague semblance of their former selves with guards Giddey and Jones back on the court. The pair had been sidelined for a considerable stretch of the season (19 games for Giddey, 11 for Jones) before the All-Star break with hamstring injuries.\n\nJalen Smith also returned to the lineup after missing five of the last seven games before the break with a calf injury. Although his absence was less extensive, it had a bigger impact because of his status as the only remaining center on the roster from before the trade deadline.\n\nUnseld was cagey about the playing-time restrictions for all three players, declining to share details about any of their medical limits during his pregame news conference. Giddey played 21 minutes, 25 seconds and Jones 21:51 while Smith logged 24:20.\n\nBoth guards failed to score in the first half. Jones warmed into his offense in the third quarter and finished with 12 points, but Smith and Giddey struggled to connect on their shots. Smith finished with nine points on 2-for-6 shooting while Giddey scored five points on 1-for-7 shooting. Giddey added five assists while committing four turnovers.\n\nThe Bulls still aren’t playing cohesive basketball. In fact, it’s unclear whether they’ll be able to accomplish that feat — piecing together a collective identity out of a haphazard puzzle of misfit deadline acquisitions — before the regular season ends.\n\nAgainst the Raptors, that translated into sloppy basketball. The first quarter took 35 minutes to be completed as both teams combined for nine fouls and 13 turnovers. Collin Sexton turned the ball over three times in that span, including an eight-second violation when he failed to advance the ball past half-court. The Bulls gave up 28 points off 20 turnovers for the game.\n\nMatas Buzelis once again receded in a loss, scoring only four points in nearly 31:20 before getting pulled from the closing lineup. Anfernee Simons (20 points) and Isaac Okoro (16) combined for nearly one-third of the team’s scoring, but neither player looked comfortable in their respective rotations.",

    "description": "The Boston Celtics defeated the Golden State Warriors in their first game after the All-Star break, their first in a 4-game road trip.",
    "fullText": "The Boston Celtics returned from the All-Star break and came out firing on all cylinders against the Golden State Warriors, who were without Steph Curry. It was the first meeting of the season between Boston and Golden State, and a tale of two teams trending in much different directions.\n\nJaylen Brown continued his hot streak, while Payton Pritchard once again grabbed the spotlight during a West Coast road trip. The Celtics were in control for most of the game, but the Warriors came out with heavy pressure and their best full court performance in the fourth quarter to make it a close game behind a 15-0 run.\n\nIn the end, while all of Boston's starters appeared as if they'd be on the bench for the final quarter, most of the starting unit was on the floor at the end of the game. Boston would pull off the victory, but it certainly came with a bit more pressure than expected in the end.\n\nJaylen Brown's statement: Coming right out of the All-Star break, Jaylen Brown put his foot on the pedal and never let up with his triple-double performance. Brown also added to his current streak, his 17th straight game with at least 20 points, the fourth-longest active streak in the league currently. During All-Star weekend, much was made about the potential return of Jayson Tatum, but Brown continued his incredible play this season and guided the Celtics to yet another victory.\n\nEffective shooting: Boston shot incredibly well in this game, shooting over 50% from the field, over 40% from 3-point range, and just under 90% from the free throw line, making an impact at every scoring level. Four players scored in double digits in this one, led by Payton Pritchard who shot 10-18 from the field, putting together a game-high 26 points.\n\nPaint dominance: In his post-game interview, Jaylen Brown raved about his ability to get in the paint and benefit from several layup opportunities, and it didn't stop there. Boston dominated in the paint in every aspect, outscoring Golden State by 14 points down low, and cleaned up the boards, outrebounding the Warriors by 14 as well.\n\nPayton Pritchard and Kristaps Porzingis fighting like brothers 🥹 pic.twitter.com/tkJzcm73wY\n\n— Taylor Snow (@taylorcsnow) February 20, 2026\n\nBoston will continue their West Coast road trip with a visit to the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday night, the final meeting between the two historic franchises. The Celtics picked up a 21-point victory over the Lakers who were without both Luka Doncic and LeBron James in that first matchup, but both should be expected to play in the primetime matchup on Sunday. It'll be another opportunity for Jaylen Brown who is coming off a triple-double performance against the Warriors, to keep etching his name atop the best players in the league, and MVP conversation this season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Celtics Wire: Celtics hold off late rally to down Warriors in first game since ASG",

    "description": "The Kings haven't won a game since Jan. 16.",
    "fullText": "Among a horde of tanking NBA teams, the Sacramento Kings stand alone with the worst record in the NBA. It didn't get any better Thursday.\n\nThe Kings extended their losing streak to 15 games with a 131-94 defeat by the Orlando Magic, breaking the franchise record for consecutive losses. That low mark was previously held by two different streaks during the team's days of operation as the Cincinnati Royals.\n\nSacramento hasn't won a game since Jan. 16, a 128-115 win over the similarly futile Washington Wizards. To give a sports fan some perspective on how long ago that was, the NFL divisional round started the next day.\n\nThursday's loss was the most lopsided of the bunch with a 37-point scoring margin. Five of the 15 were actually by fewer than five points, but the Kings couldn't get it done.\n\nAs a reminder, the Kings fired current New York Knicks head coach Mike Brown after his team suffered a ... five-game losing streak.\n\nThe Kings will get their next chance to break the streak with a road game against Victor Wembanyama and the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday. After that, their next three opponents are the Memphis Grizzlies, Houston Rockets and Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThere is hardly reason to expect an improvement in the latter stage of the season, beyond the idea that an NBA team just can't be this bad. The Kings announced Wednesday that All-Star big man Domantas Sabonis had undergone season-ending surgery to repair the torn meniscus in his left knee. Zach LaVine, the team's leading scorer, is already out for the season following a hand surgery.\n\nWith those two out, Thursday offered a vision of how the Kings will be operating moving forward. DeMar DeRozan scored 13 points on 3-of-11 shooting. Russell Westbrook had 5 points on 2-of-8 shooting, with 1 assist and 3 turnovers. The bench scored 30 points on a combined 9-of-29 shooting with 8 assists and 9 turnovers.\n\nA bright spot might have been rookie Maxime Reynaud, who started at center in Sabonis' place and posted 17 points on 8-of-13 shooting with 14 rebounds and 4 assists. The Kings were outscored by 14 points in his 39 minutes on the floor, which was actually tied for the team's second-best plus/minus among the 10 players who got minutes.\n\nIt's tempting to say the Kings won't even be trying for the rest of the season, but that's not exactly how it works. Ownership and the executive suite might not mind more of the same, which would guarantee them a top-5 pick in the loaded 2026 NBA Draft, but the players still have plenty of reason to compete. This just happens to be an extremely broken roster right now.\n\nThere is now quite some distance between Sacramento and the rest of the NBA in the standings. The Wizards, Brooklyn Nets, Indiana Pacers and New Orleans Pelicans all have 15 wins as of Thursday night, with the Kings three wins clear of their closest \"competition\" for the lottery's top position.",

When the Mount Pulaski team exited the DeWitt County school gymnasium with 49-36 loss on Feb. 9, McVickers knew he had what he needed: motivation, a reason to tell the players that they’re good, but can be beaten and can be better. Instead, the players were ready on the same page.\n\n“I think the loss at Clinton was kind of that extra motivation that we needed,” McVickers said. “We were just kind of rolling right along and beating teams pretty easily, and then they kind of gave us that wake-up call on their floor — a bigger 2A team.\n\n“I walked in the locker room, and they were mad. I mean, they were mad after that loss. Heck, we were sitting there at 25-1, and for them to be mad, I knew that that was a great sign.”\n\nMore: Carlinville feels Reels good in regional title win over Williamsville\n\nWhat does perfection look like? McVickers will probably say that Thursday night wasn’t perfection, and if that’s not perfection, Mount Pulaski could have an extended postseason run as the top-seeded Hilltoppers throttled No. 5 Stewardson-Strasburg 50-27 to win the Class 1A Mount Pulaski Regional championship. It was the school’s third title in five seasons.\n\nIt was also the Hilltoppers’ fourth straight win after that Clinton loss and takes their record to 29-1.  Mount Pulaski faces No. 2 Hume Shiloh (19-6) on Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the Argenta-Oreana Sectional semifinals.\n\n“After we lost to Clinton, that really flipped our switch, and we just kept on rolling,” Mount Pulaski junior Addy Brown said. “Playing our game throughout the rest of the season is what we're going to do.”\n\nBrown led the Hilltoppers with 16 points. She connected on four 3-pointers and grabbed seven rebounds, four on the offensive end.\n\nMount Pulaski got the win through intense pressure defense that can stretch the length of the court, getting extra possessions through turnovers and offensive rebounds, and an unselfishness that led to beautiful ball movement, resulting in open shots and easy looks at the basket.\n\n“When our defense is flying around and anticipating that next pass, we really do a nice job of jumping in those passing lanes,” McVickers said. “Once we get the steal, we're off, and we're flying, and we're running, and we can get those turnovers and then convert them into easy transition buckets.”\n\nIn the second quarter alone, freshman Ella Martin snuck into the paint twice with the Hatchets completely unaware for a pair of easy layups. Mount Pulaski rebounded three of its own misses on the same possession to further stymie Stew-Stras, had 17 offensive boards and outrebounded the Hatchets 36-23.\n\nMore: Calvary's rebounding gets offensive in big win at Mount Pulaski\n\nWhen Stew-Stras wasn’t turning the ball over due to Mount Pulaski’s pressure, the Hilltoppers were outright taking it from the Hatchets, like when Alyson Murphy overpowered point guard Cameron Carey and ripped the ball out of her hands.\n\nMcVickers also has the luxury of a deep roster of scorers. While Brown and Elayna Marten (11 points) combined to score 27, McVickers knows he can count on any of the players on the floor to score if needed. The Hatchets focused its defensive effort on Murphy, and the senior finished with just four points. But sophomore Olivia Smith had eight, Brown had six and Audrey Cooper, a junior, had five.\n\n“Our main thing is just energy all the time and always bringing our best efforts and just always showing up for each other, working as hard as we can all the time,” Marten said, then added that the team really focused on improving several areas of its game ahead of the postseason.\n\n“I would say just always looking for that one extra pass, always boxing out every single possession no matter what, and just always critiquing the little things and making sure we're improving in all areas and doing all the little things.”\n\nBrown said the Hilltoppers come out in a fury to start the game knowing that early effort could pay off by watching the end of the game from the bench, as they were able to in the running-clock win.\n\n“Our press is really good; we fly,” Brown said. “Getting those steals early and getting up by 15, 20 early is what really brings our motivation and energy to go throughout the rest of the game.”\n\nMount Pulaski is looking for its first sectional title since 2013 when the Hilltoppers finished second in the Class 1A state tournament.\n\nContact Ryan Mahan: 788-1546, ryan.mahan@sj-r.com, Twitter.com/RyanMahanSJR.\n\nThis article originally appeared on State Journal-Register: IHSA girls basketball: Mount Pulaski rolls to regional title win",

    "fullText": "The Gable Steveson hype train is full steam ahead, and the next stop could be in the UFC's octagon after making quick work of another opponent.\n\nIn the main event of Mexico Fight League 3, Steveson (3-0) took on Hugo Lezama in a heavyweight bout at Showcenter Complex in Monterrey, Mexico. Lezama (11-4) was Steveson's most experienced opponent yet, but that really didn't matter for the hottest heavyweight MMA prospect in the game today. With UFC legend Jon Jones in his corner, Steveson ended the fight at 3:50 in the opening round by TKO.\n\nLezama offered a few big, sloppy windups and even connected with a spinning back kick to the head. Steveson walked through it all, though, and calmly took control of the fight on the mat with heavy ground and pound. After letting Lezama work through a few positions from his back, the referee decided to stop the fight after Stevenson opened a cut and began turning up the volume of his ground strikes.\n\nIt was like another day at the office for Steveson, whose celebration was not much more than a few smiles. During his post-fight interview, he said he plans to get back to work on a few things while he awaits what comes next.\n\nWhat's next could be his UFC debut.\n\nThe promotion has not hidden its interest in having the Olympic gold medalist wrestler on its roster, but wanted to see him get a little more experience in MMA competition before welcoming him face the experienced opposition in the UFC. He is now 3-0 in MMA competition, plus a win under the custom ruleset of Dirty Boxing Championship. Steveson has won each fight in the first round.\n\nSteveson has said he would love to make his debut at the upcoming UFC White House event in June, which would be a massive introduction to the audience.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Gable Steveson grows to 3-0 in MMA with potential UFC debut on horizon",

    "fullText": "A dominant Cade Cunningham scored 42 points as the NBA-leading Detroit Pistons swatted aside the New York Knicks 126-111 Thursday on the basketball league's return from its brief All-Star Game break.\n\nBilled as a must-watch clash between two Eastern Conference-vying rivals each in red-hot form, the game at Madison Square Garden became an exhibition for Cunningham, who also provided 13 assists and eight rebounds.\n\nThe 24-year-old burnished his credentials as a Most Valuable Player contender, helping a young, surprise-package Pistons side to improve the best record in the entire NBA this season so far, to 41-13.\n\nAfter the game, Cunningham insisted he and his side had proved \"nothing\" yet.\n\n\"It's regular season, so we just have to keep on chipping at it, keep on growing, keep on getting better and preparing for the postseason,\" he said.\n\n\"We're off to a great start. Obviously, we feel great about that. But everything is to come.\"\n\nDespite their blistering form, Detroit -- wholly reconstructed after finishing rock-bottom of the Eastern Conference just two years ago -- are still few pundits' top pick to win the title.\n\nThey were also without forward Isaiah Stewart and All-Star center Jalen Duren on Thursday, due to suspensions following a brawl with the Charlotte Hornets during game last week.\n\n\"Missing Stew, JD, that's a big part of our team. Big part of why we are where we are. So everyone had to step up,\" said Cunningham.\n\nAnd the Knicks had entered the game third in the Eastern Conference, on a run of 10 wins from 12, comparable to the Pistons' 12 from 15 ahead of Thursday's clash.\n\nBut Detroit had extra motivation -- revenge after the Knicks knocked them out of the playoffs last year in the first round. The win on Thursday completes a three-win regular season sweep over the Knicks.\n\n\"If felt great,\" said Cunningham, who poured in three three-pointers in the first quarter alone. He added two more later in the game, with other highlights including a huge, driving dunk in the third quarter.\n\nElsewhere, Jaylen Brown recorded a triple-double as the in-form Boston Celtics overwhelmed the Golden State Warriors 121-110.\n\nConsolidating second spot in the Eastern Conference, the Celtics led by as much as 34 points in the third quarter, before the Warriors reduced the deficit but to no avail.\n\nBrown managed 23 points, 13 assists and 15 rebounds, while Payton Pritchard top-scored with 26 from the bench, in the Celtics' seventh win from their past eight games.\n\nThursday's games were the first since the NBA regular season briefly paused for the All-Star Game weekend.\n\n\"It's early, first game back,\" said Brown.\n\n\"I'm just being aggressive, finding my spots,\" he added.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers earned a sixth consecutive win. The Cavs beat the Brooklyn Nets 112-84 to draw level with the Knicks in third place.\n\nJalen Johnson dominated a 117-107 Atlanta Hawks road win over the Philadelphia 76ers, scoring 32 points, with 10 rebounds, five assists and three steals.\n\nKevin Durant managed 35 points in the Houston Rockets' 105-101 victory over the Hornets.\n\nIn the West, the Sacramento Kings set an unwanted franchise record with a 15-game losing streak, after going down 131-94 to the Orlando Magic.\n\nAnd the second-placed San Antonio Spurs put some pressure on the leaders, Oklahoma City Thunder, with a 121-94 triumph over the Phoenix Suns.\n\nThe Spurs' seventh consecutive win takes them to 39-16, still trailing the Thunder on 42-14.",

    "fullText": "John Stones has once again battled injury throughout the 2025/26 season. The England international has made only 14 appearances for Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City side in all competitions this season. Stones recently returned from an extended injury layoff and played 65 minutes of City’s 2-0 win over Salford City at the Etihad Stadium in their fourth-round FA Cup tie. John Stones could have an important role to play for Pep Guardiola’s side for the remainder of this season as they remain in the hunt for four trophies. Looking beyond this season, John Stones’ future seems to lie away from Manchester City, based on a recent report.\n\nIt was pleasing to see John Stones start Manchester City’s match against Salford City. He put in a workmanlike performance as he did his job well as City’s captain for the day and as a centre-back. It was clear that Stones was rusty, but the fact that he got through 65 minutes unscathed is a major positive for Manchester City. Stones has had a frustrating 25/26 season, so seeing him get through any match without suffering any injury setbacks is a pleasing sight.\n\nPep Guardiola was happy to see John Stones back on the pitch against Salford City. Guardiola admitted that Stones is someway off his best, but the fact he is back playing is good news. Speaking on John Stone’ return, Guardiola said: “It’s good he’s back. He still needs time. He’s not the John Stones we knew but that’s normal. His body language was really good and he had the tempo to fight the duels. After more than two months injured, he played 60 minutes.”\n\nIf John Stones can stay fit and rediscover his best form, he will have an important role to play as Manchester City remain in the hunt in four competitions. Stones offers Pep Guardiola a completely different option at centre-back to any of City’s other centre-backs. The hope is that the worst of Stones’ injury concerns are behind him so he can play a role across the back end of this season for his team.\n\nLooking further ahead, it does seem that we are in the final stages of John Stones’ Manchester City career. A new report from Mark Brus in his exclusive Daily Briefing column indicates that Stones won’t be offered a new contract at City. Stones’ current deal is set to expire at the end of this season. Furthermore, Brus reports that Bayern Munich have shown an interest in signing Stones at the end of this season. Bayern are reportedly considering making a move for Stones as they bid to strengthen their defence. AC Milan and Atletico Madrid are also mentioned by Brus as clubs monitoring the situation surrounding John Stones.\n\nWhat may hinder clubs in the chase to sign John Stones is his wage demands. Mark Brus reports that Everton have been ruled out of the potential race to sign the England international due to this factor. Despite a return to Everton being ruled out, John Stones seemingly has options if his Manchester City career ends at the end of this season. Players at this stage of their careers often look for the right environment to continue progressing. They weigh different opportunities and consider what comes next. Supporters tend to think in similar terms when deciding how to spend their time or money online, whether that means watching football, playing games, or picking up a Steam card online before moving on to their next title. Stones may yet face similar choices abroad as he looks to take the next step after City.\n\nIt was pleasing to see John Stones get through Manchester City’s FA Cup fourth-round win over Salford City unscathed. The hope is that Stones can contribute to his team across the final stages of this season. Given everything that Stones has done for City, he deserves to be a contributor as Pep Guardiola’s side chases honours on multiple fronts. The end may be coming for John Stones’ time at Manchester City. If it is, it would be better to see him have one last hurrah at City rather than spend his time on the treatment table.",

    "title": "Fan Letters: Concerns Surrounding Sunderland’s Wheelchair Ticketing Policy",
    "description": "RR reader Niall Taylor is concerned about a lack of accessibility for Lads’ fans when following the team away from home",
    "fullText": "I’m a wheelchair user who regularly attends away games and has done so for many years.\n\nThis season, Sunderland AFC have changed their approach to away ticket sales for wheelchair supporters.\n\nEven when wheelchair-accessible tickets are still available, they’re not being sold once the general away allocation for non-disabled supporters has “sold out.” I’ve been told this is because allowing wheelchair supporters to buy these tickets would be “unfair on other supporters.”\n\nWheelchair allocations are already extremely limited.\n\nFor example, an away allocation of around 2,500 tickets may include as few as sixteen wheelchair spaces. From years of attending away games, I know these wheelchair allocations rarely sell out and a clear example is Oxford away this season.\n\nAfter tickets sold out in Phase Two, I was refused a wheelchair ticket despite eight of the thirteen wheelchair spaces still being available at the time. This is a noticeable change from previous seasons in League One and the Championship, where wheelchair supporters were still able to purchase available wheelchair tickets even after the general allocation had sold out.\n\nThe current policy results in wheelchair spaces being left empty while disabled supporters are excluded from attending matches. I believe this raises serious questions around accessibility, fairness and equal access for Sunderland supporters.\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi, Niall. Thank you for your letter.\n\nThis is clearly an extremely important issue and it’s unfortunate to hear that you weren’t able to be accommodated for the FA Cup game at Oxford — a game during which everyone should’ve been given the chance to support the team on the road.\n\nWithout knowing the exact ins and outs of why this policy has seemingly been changed and any possible logistical reasoning, what I will say is that the club certainly has a duty of care to all fans and moving forward, it’s imperative that nobody is excluded or made to feel unwelcome or a burden. That’s the very last thing that our club should stand for.\n\nI think I’d better stop reading other Sunderland fans’ posts and blogs, because some of the rubbish I’ve read about us suddenly being in a relegation fight is ridiculous!\n\nAs I’ve said before, we have enough class in the team to finish the season pretty comfortably. The plan at the start was to avoid relegation and we’ve nearly done that, plus we might have a nice cup run on the go.\n\nI’ll say it again: Keep the faith ‘til the end — and FTM forever!\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi, John. Thank you for getting in touch.\n\nPerhaps it’s a result of the scars left by what happened almost a decade ago, but until we reach the much-discussed total of forty points (and possibly forty two, just to be absolutely certain) I wouldn’t criticise any Sunderland fan for being a little edgy.\n\nOf course, we have what feels like a good run of games coming up, during which we’ve got an excellent chance of picking up the six points we’ll possibly need, so let’s see what happens, and hopefully the Lads can get back to winning ways in the league against Fulham on Sunday!",

    "fullText": "GREEN BAY, Wis. (WFRV) – Bleeding green and gold is par for the course here in Northeast Wisconsin, but on Thursday afternoon one cheesehead stood above all the rest.\n\nThe Packers announced their latest inductee into the Green Bay Packers Fan Hall of Fame. There were 10 finalists.\n\nThis year’s Fan Hall of Fame inductee was Patrick Suplicki from Stevens Point. He told Local 5 News that becoming a Packers fan was a birthright in his family.\n\n“In our family, you were always a Packers fan from birth, you were nothing else,” Patrick said.\n\nHe said he became a Packers fan at age three and has bled green and gold ever since. He’s been going to games at Lambeau Field since 1972 and said that watching Reggie White and Bart Starr play were among his favorite Packers memories.\n\nBay Area boys hockey upsets NDA to advance to sectionals\n\nHis dad Elgie was the one who got him hooked on the Packers and taught him the importance of being loyal to your team. Patrick began renovating his basement at his home to turn it into a Packers man cave. He stopped the project in 2003 when his father passed away, but eventually picked the project up and completed it to honor his father.\n\nPatrick’s basement has become the place for his friends and family to gather for Packers games. He said he prides himself on nurturing the next generation of Packers fans and including his two daughters.\n\n“It was kind of a rule to be a Packer fan in the house,” his daughter Patrice said. “I don’t think we could have entertained any other team even if we wanted to.”\n\nPatrick is also a cancer survivor and says that being able to look forward to Packers games help him win that battle.\n\n“I think he thought that would be the biggest thing he did in life,” Patrice told Local 5 News. “But now I think this is the biggest thing to be immortalized in the Packers Fan Hall Of Fame.”\n\nPatrice nominated him for the Packers Fan Hall of Fame. She was able to contact Packers legendary wide receiver Antonio Freeman who recorded a video breaking the news that Patrick was a finalist. He learned the news on Christmas Eve.\n\nPatrice said it was emotional seeing her father get inducted into the Fan Hall of Fame on Thursday afternoon. She said that her dad has always been there for all the big moments in her life, so she was so happy to return the favor and be here on her dad’s big day.\n\n14 high schoolers gather for Encore Singers Revue in Appleton through Center Stage program\n\n“Watching him up there, giving his speech being honored for the amazing man and Packers fan he is,” she told Local 5 News. “It was the biggest honor I could have as his daughter and the rest of his family (feels that way too).”\n\nPatrick reflected on the influence his father had on him over the years to get him to the point where he could become a member of the Packers Fan Hall of Fame.\n\n“It means a lot to me, I wish the one main family member was here but unfortunately we lost him in 2003 (his dad),” Patrick said. “My dad I think he would have been awed by this, kicking up his heels because he was the ultimate fan. I’d like to think he’d be really proud of us.”\n\nAs part of getting inducted into the team’s Fan Hall of Fame, he also got four club tickets to a Packers home game this upcoming season, pregame sideline passes, a custom Packers jersey, and a gift card to the Packers pro shop.\n\nPatrick is the 28th member of the Packers Fan Hall of Fame.",

    "fullText": "Sunderland’s promotion campaign was staying on course. Just. After a draw at Preston in the face of mounting criticism from supporters, the lads took on Brentford at Roker Park, searching for a much-needed three points – via a relatively convincing win – to solidify our position at the top of the table.\n\nResults hadn’t been bad – although a Sherpa Van Trophy at the hands of Hartlepool hadn’t gone down well – but performances hadn’t been overly impressive, with Denis Smith’s team grinding out wins rather than demolishing teams as they had done earlier in the season.\n\nAs the clash against Steve Perryman’s Brentford approached, Smith was beset by injury and illness concerns, with Marco Gabbiadini ruled out with what was first thought to be a recurrence of a groin injury, but what subsequently turned out to be a glandular problem after an infection set into a knee cut sustained on Preston’s artificial pitch.\n\nEric Gates was absent from the club having been laid low with influenza, as had a number of other players who were coming out of the other end.\n\nGordon Armstrong, Reuben Agboola and Iain Hesford were all able to train yesterday but they all looked awful when the session was over.\n\nPaul Atkinson and Richard Ord are a bit better but did not train, so until I know who is available I am not in a position to name the team.\n\nIn line to start against Brentford should Gates and Gabbiadini not make it was 17 year old youth team forward John Hepple. The youngster, who hailed from Middlesbrough, had impressed Denis Smith in training, and it was reported that Hepple would be making his debut alongside Keith Bertschin should neither of the G Force make it.\n\nThe highly rated, slight youngster was – unfortunately for him – not listed on the team sheet when the lines ups were announced before the game; Gates had emerged from his sick bed to partner Bertschin. But it was another youngster – Gary Owers – himself returning from a five week injury lay off, who opened the scoring.\n\nOwers had made his professional debut in the reverse fixture on the season’s opening weekend, and on this occasion the 19 year old scored with a header just before the half hour mark to put Sunderland into the lead.\n\nSunderland had already exerted pressure on the Brentford defence – a clear penalty for a foul on Armstrong had been turned down, and a less clear shout for handball had also been met with a resounding no. Bertschin had also tested the Brentford keeper Gary Phillips, while Owers had headed narrowly wide, too.\n\nIt hadn’t been one way traffic, however. MacPhail had cleared from just under his own bar, while a superb tackle from Agboola denied future England winger an almost certain goal.\n\nThe breakthrough came after a well worked free kick between Paul Atkinson and Steve Doyle saw the local winger work his way to the byline and cross for Bertschin to flick on, and Owers to stoop to head home.\n\nBertschin, Atkinson and Owers were causing the Brentford defence problems – a welcome sight for the home crowd given Gabbiadini’s absence – and just before half time Bertschin made it 2-0, striding through onto Gates’ pass to put the ball home, via a deflection from a Brentford defender.\n\nOwers should have made it three before the break, but elected to go round the advancing goalkeeper rather than lob the ball home. Young defender Roger Joseph – who went on to have a long career with Wimbledon – was able to clear.\n\nIn the second half, Sunderland went for the kill, but found Phillips in excellent form, saving from Bertschin and Gates, while Bertschin saw another effort cleared off the line, and Gates’ follow up saved. Bennett headed wide, and Brentford almost put through their own net from a dangerous Frank Gray corner.\n\nIn the closing stages Brentford came close, but Hesford preserved his clean sheet, and Sunderland emerged 2-0 winners, to maintain first place in the division. And Smith, who’d been presented with a gallon of whisky for winning the Third Division Manager of the Month for January was proud of how his team had navigated a major challenge.\n\nI’ve never seen so many players completely drained after a match. They’re all sitting around spluttering and coughing. Even players like Gary Bennett, Gary Owers and Steve Doyle who were not affected have now gone down with the bug.\n\nPaul Atkinson struggled on for as long as he could, but we finally had to take him off after an hour. He just couldn’t go on any longer. Obviously, they are all shattered, and I have told them all to get off home and not report back until Tuesday.\n\nAs for John Hepple, he never did play a professional game for the lads. He was released at the end of the following season, and while he did make a couple of appearances on loan at Hartlepool, that’s all the records suggest. Sadly, he passed away in 2008, aged just 37, after a fall at home, apparently suffering a heart attack.",

    "description": "“We can look to extend what’s been an enjoyable cup run so far!”, writes Ben Littledyke.",
    "fullText": "After hitting a relatively rough patch of form in the league of late (at least by our high standards this season), the FA Cup fourth round came as a welcome distraction and a tie against Oxford would hopefully give us the chance to notch a rare win on the road.\n\nThis blog has taken an unplanned hiatus in recent weeks, with motivation to write about the two defeats in the capital largely non-existent.\n\nSuffice to say, the West Ham game was just as dreadful as everyone said, but the trip to Arsenal saw a much better performance during which we ultimately fell short against the best side in the league. No great shame and it’s certainly time to put those two in the proverbial bin and move on.\n\nThe jaunt to Oxford would’ve taken place on the only consistently bright, sunny day of the year so far on Saturday, but thanks to TNT Sports it was shunted back into the seemingly perpetual 2026 downpour that resumed on Sunday. There’s an almost hilarious contrast between England in the sun and in the rain — even the beautiful architecture of Oxford took on a melancholic feel.\n\nSpeaking of melancholy, the only public house open for the early arrivals at Oxford was the local Wetherspoons, which had drawn in a sizable contingent of Sunderland fans seeking shelter from the rain. After another solidly unremarkable away day breakfast, we filtered across to The Grapes, where a resident Manchester United fan told us we were the last leg he needed for his FA Cup accumulator.\n\nWe hoped he had better luck than that moppy-haired lad in Spain. The Lamb and Flag, one of the best pubs in Oxford, was full of studious academic-types diligently hammering their laptops and sipping their lattes, occasionally glancing up to cast a disapproving look at our lot supping our pre-match pints. Variety is the spice of life, at the end of the day!\n\nThe starting eleven was out as we pulled up at The George Inn — one of the only pubs anywhere in the vague vicinity of the ground.\n\nWe’d expected to see Melker Ellborg in for Robin Roefs but the fact the Dutchman kept his place is perhaps an indicator of how seriously we’re taking the cup competitions this year. A few of last year’s stalwarts in Luke O’Nien and Dennis Cirkin were given starts, and their extensive experience against EFL bruisers would doubtless come in handy. It would’ve been nice to have seen Chris Rigg feature too, but again, the team selection hinted at a serious tilt for a cup run this year, so we could have few complaints, all in all.\n\nThe rain persisted as we once again found ourselves enjoying the stunning juxtaposed views of the pitch and car park at the Kassam.\n\nThe atmosphere had echoes of the League One era, with Oxford doing their best on and off the pitch to create the sense of plucky underdogs against the entitled ‘Big Boys’, but thankfully we now have a squad that genuinely is levels above this kind of opposition, and they largely struggled to lay a glove on us despite a relatively low-key performance from Sunderland.\n\nAs soon as Habib Diarra calmly stroked home the penalty (which came after what looked like a clear foul from the opposite end of the ground, so Christ knows what the TNT commentators were watching), you felt that we would have enough to see this one home.\n\nIn terms of performances, the defence was solid, there were some promising flashes from Jocelin Ta Bi (normally I’m loathe to address players by their first name as if they’re a close mate, but the Ta Bi/Talbi combo could be a nightmare for both commentators and writers alike), and Romaine Mundle was lively all game without any real end product.\n\nOxford’s number four seemed keen to embrace a pantomime villain role, but his only memorable contribution other than whinging was a series of futile long throws, which Roefs and our defence dealt with comfortably. As the sun finally broke through the clouds, the referee blew his whistle and we could show our appreciation for a professional job well done.\n\nThe fifth-round draw against either Port Vale or Bristol City is a logistical nightmare for fans, but at least we avoided any of the Premier League heavyweights and can look to extend what’s been an enjoyable cup run so far.",

    "description": "It’s Sunderland versus Durham in the latest “River Wear Derby”. Charlotte Patterson previews tonight’s clash!",
    "fullText": "There are fixtures that feel routine; there are fixtures that feel like they carry the weight of something more — and Durham versus Sunderland belongs firmly in the latter category.\n\nA Friday night under the lights at Maiden Castle, two North East rivals separated by only a few miles and by even less in the league table, both fighting to keep themselves clear of the relegation battle. It’s the kind of match that defines seasons, shapes momentum and stirs emotions along the length of the A690.\n\nFor Sunderland, the build up to this game has been anything but straightforward. Consecutive postponements have left the Lasses without competitive action for three long weeks, a stretch that feels even more frustrating when the team had been desperate to build rhythm and consistency.\n\nLast week our fixture fell victim to the weather, with the game postponed the day before.\n\nHowever, our Friday night meeting with Sheffield United was called off in dramatic fashion amid heavy rain and worsening conditions, leaving supporters who’d already braved the weather feeling deflated and disappointed. The sense of anticlimax was captured in reports describing the postponement as a punchline delivered after fans had already committed their evening to the match.\n\nSunderland have been left in limbo: training hard, preparing diligently, but unable to translate that work into match minutes. Head coach Mel Reay has spoken about the need to embrace the pause and use it as a platform for growth, but there’s no denying that the squad will be itching to get back onto the pitch.\n\nTonight, they finally get their chance.\n\nThree weeks without a match feels like an eternity in football.\n\nIt disrupts rhythm, halts momentum and forces players to sit with the frustration of preparation without release — and for Sunderland, the timing could hardly have been worse.\n\nThe Lasses had been looking to build on a mixed run of form, with recent results including a win over Southampton and a hard fought victory against Ipswich, but also defeats to Nottingham Forest and Portsmouth.\n\nThe stop-start nature of their season has made it difficult to establish a clear trajectory, the postponements have also created a sense of pent up energy within the squad, yet training sessions have been intense, competitive and purposeful.\n\nPlayers who thrive on matchday adrenaline have been forced to channel that energy into controlled environments. The coaching staff will have worked hard to keep spirits high and focus sharp, but there’s no substitute for the real thing and Sunderland will arrive at Maiden Castle with a hunger that’s been building for weeks.\n\nThe break hasn’t been entirely unproductive as Sunderland have strengthened their squad with two significant loan signings. These additions have added fresh quality and depth at a crucial point in the season.\n\nThe first of the two loan arrivals was Griffiths, a highly-rated winger from Manchester United.\n\nGriffiths joined Sunderland after progressing through United’s academy and making a first team matchday squad for the first time in late 2024. She also scored her first senior international goal for Wales in October 2025 — a milestone that underlined her growing reputation, and she’s been described as “an exciting addition who brings pace, creativity and directness to the flanks”.\n\nThe second arrival was Northern Ireland international Hamilton, who joined from Nottingham Forest.\n\nHamilton is a versatile defender who can operate as a full back, wing back or even in central defence. With more than fifty international caps and experience across multiple levels of the English game, she brings leadership and composure to the back line. Her loan move was confirmed earlier this month, with Sunderland highlighting her wealth of experience and the value she adds to the squad.\n\nBoth signings were announced within days of each other, signalling the Lasses’ intent to strengthen intelligently and decisively. Reports described the double loan swoop as a move that “reshaped the complexion of the squad for the remainder of the season”.\n\nGriffiths offers attacking spark; Hamilton offers defensive stability and will be eager to make their mark, and both could play a significant role tonight.\n\nWhile Sunderland have been stuck in limbo, Durham have at least had the chance to play.\n\nTheir most recent outing was a 4 2 defeat away to Charlton Athletic — a match that exposed both their strengths and their vulnerabilities. Charlton’s victory extended their unbeaten run, but Durham didn’t go quietly. They scored twice, including a goal from Mariel Speckmaier and a late own goal forced by pressure in the box.\n\nThe match was chaotic at times.\n\nCharlton dominated possession and created more chances, but Durham showed resilience and flashes of attacking quality. The game sparked into life with a moment of magic from Charlton’s Karin Muya, but Durham responded well, equalising through Speckmaier before half time. Charlton regained control with goals either side of the break and although Durham pulled one back late on, the home side sealed the win with an 88th-minute strike.\n\nThe defeat highlighted several key themes of Durham’s season.\n\nThey’re capable of scoring goals and creating chances, but they’ve struggled to maintain defensive solidity against high tempo, possession-based sides. Their work rate is unquestionable and their physicality can unsettle opponents, but lapses in concentration have cost them at crucial moments.\n\nDurham will be determined to respond tonight — particularly in front of their home supporters.\n\nDurham have long been known for their resilience, organisation and ability to make life difficult for opponents.\n\nThey’re a team built on collective effort rather than individual stars and their physical approach has often been a hallmark of their identity. They press aggressively, compete fiercely for second balls and look to disrupt the rhythm of more possession oriented teams.\n\nOne of their key strengths is their ability to transition quickly. When they win the ball, they look to break with pace, often through wide areas. Players like Speckmaier offer a direct threat, and Durham are at their best when they can turn defensive moments into attacking opportunities.\n\nHowever, their weaknesses have been increasingly exposed this season. Their defensive structure has shown cracks — particularly against teams who move the ball quickly and stretch the pitch — and the 4-2 defeat to Charlton was a clear example of this, with Charlton taking twenty one shots to Durham’s ten and also dominating possession.\n\nDurham also struggle when forced to chase games.\n\nTheir style is built on discipline and shape, and when they fall behind, they can become vulnerable as they push forward. This has contributed to a run of inconsistent results that’s left them hovering dangerously close to the relegation battle.\n\nThe head-to-head record between Durham and Sunderland has always carried a sense of local pride and competitive edge.\n\nThey know each other well, share a geographical closeness and have built a derby that feels authentic to the North East. Over the years, the meetings have been tight, physical and often unpredictable, shaped as much by emotion as by form.\n\nThis season added another chapter to that story.\n\nThe first meeting of the season took place at Eppleton, with Sunderland earning a 2–1 victory in front of a lively home crowd. It was a match that reflected many of the themes that have defined this derby, with Sunderland starting brightly, pressing with intent and taking control of the early stages.\n\nDurham responded with their usual physicality and directness, forcing Sunderland to defend with discipline, but the Lasses showed composure in key moments, took their chances and held firm under late pressure to secure the win.\n\nThat result not only strengthened Sunderland’s overall advantage in the head-to-head record, but also added a psychological element to tonight’s meeting.\n\nSunderland know they can beat Durham this season. They know they can handle the intensity of the derby and find solutions against Durham’s aggressive style. Durham, meanwhile, will be eager to respond — particularly on home soil — and will see this as an opportunity to restore balance.\n\nSunderland now have nine wins in the fixture, Durham remain on four, and the number of draws stays at three.\n\nSunderland have scored twenty seven goals across all meetings, while Durham have scored twenty one. The numbers tell a story of Sunderland’s historical edge, but also underline how competitive the rivalry has been. Durham have never been an easy opponent, and Maiden Castle has often provided the backdrop for some of the most fiercely contested matches between the two sides.\n\nTonight’s meeting feels like another significant chapter. Sunderland arrive with the confidence of that earlier win, whereas Durham arrive with the determination to put things right.\n\nThe record provides context, but derbies have a habit of ignoring history and writing their own scripts.\n\nThere’s something special about football under lights.\n\nThe atmosphere feels sharper, the noise carries further and the sense of occasion is heightened. Maiden Castle has hosted many memorable nights, and tonight promises to be another.\n\nDurham have worked hard to build a strong sense of community spirit around their home matches, and Friday night fixtures often draw larger and more vocal crowds. The proximity of the two clubs adds an extra layer of tension — supporters and players know each other, and the rivalry is rooted in local pride.\n\nFor Sunderland fans, the short trip down the road will feel like a release after weeks of waiting. For Durham fans, it’a a chance to rally behind their team and push them towards a crucial result.\n\nBoth teams are hovering near the lower end of the table, and both are desperate to avoid being dragged into a relegation fight. A win tonight would provide breathing room and momentum. A defeat would increase the pressure and raise difficult questions.\n\nFrom a tactical perspective, the match is likely to be shaped by Sunderland’s desire to control possession and Durham’s determination to disrupt that rhythm.\n\nThis season, Sunderland have shown that they can play with composure and structure, building from the back and using their wide players to stretch the pitch. The addition of Griffiths gives them another option in the final third — someone who can beat defenders and deliver dangerous balls into the box.\n\nHamilton’s arrival strengthens the defensive unit. Her versatility gives Mel Reay more flexibility in how she sets up the backline and Sunderland may look to use her experience to counter Durham’s physical approach.\n\nDurham, meanwhile, will look to make the game scrappy. They’ll press aggressively, challenge for every loose ball and try to force Sunderland into mistakes. Their best moments often come from turnovers in midfield, and they’ll be keen to exploit any rustiness in Sunderland’s play after the long break.\n\nSet pieces could also play a significant role. Both teams have shown vulnerability in defending dead ball situations, and both have players capable of delivering dangerous deliveries.\n\nPsychology will also be a major factor tonight, and Sunderland’s frustration following the postponements could either fuel their performance or create early tension if things don’t go their way. The Lasses will need to settle quickly, find their rhythm and avoid forcing the issue.\n\nDurham, on the other hand, will be looking to bounce back from their defeat to Charlton. They’ll want to show resilience and respond positively in front of their home supporters. A strong start could give them confidence and put Sunderland on the back foot.\n\nThe derby element adds another layer. These matches are rarely decided by form alone — they’re shaped by emotion, intensity and the ability to handle pressure.\n\nWith both teams sitting near the lower half of the table, the importance of tonight’s match can’t be overstated.\n\nA win would provide momentum, confidence and a crucial buffer against the teams below — but defeat would increase the pressure and raise the stakes for the remaining fixtures.\n\nFor Sunderland, the match represents a chance to reset their season after weeks of disruption. For Durham, it’s an opportunity to steady the ship after a difficult run of results.\n\nBoth teams know what’s at stake and what this fixture means — and both teams will be desperate to emerge with three points.\n\nDurham versus Sunderland is always a significant fixture, but tonight it feels even more important. The setting, the stakes and the stories surrounding both teams have combined to create a match that promises drama, intensity and emotion.\n\nSunderland arrive hungry, refreshed and strengthened by new signings. Durham arrive battle-tested, determined and eager to respond to their recent defeat.\n\nUnder the lights at Maiden Castle, with supporters from both sides creating a charged atmosphere, this derby has all the ingredients for a classic.",

    "fullText": "Paul Merson has dropped his predictions for Chelsea’s next Premier League game, home to Burnley on Saturday afternoon.\n\nMerson’s predictions are usually not far off. Of course, he cannot read the future, so they will often be wrong as well. But from my experience, whenever he predicts Chelsea games, he is more often than not, not too far off the ball.\n\nChelsea welcome relegation battling Burnley in the 3pm kick off in the Premier League on Saturday, and they will need to avoid a repeat of what happened during their last game against a relegation battling side.\n\nThe Blues were cruising it against Leeds United but then threw it away and let them come back into the game, earning a draw in the end.\n\nPaul Merson worried about Chelsea on Sky Sports.\n\nWriting for Sportskeeda, Merson said:\n\n‘Burnley had a great result against Crystal Palace but it looks like a fluke after their FA Cup exit to Mansfield Town. I can’t see anything but a Chelsea win here, they will destroy Burnley this weekend!\n\n‘This is a must-win game for Chelsea because from here, the fixtures get messy for them. It’s a horrendous run coming up. Liam Rosenior likes deploying Andrey Santos and Moises Caicedo in the base of his midfield. I expect Enzo Fernandez to continue as the no.10, with Cole Palmer and Pedro Neto either side of Joao Pedro.\n\n‘I like Palmer as a no.10. I think that’s his best position. But Santos has been one of the best performers under Rosenior so I don’t think Chelsea will change anything. They also need some continuity in their starting line-up ahead of what promises to be a challenging run of fixtures.\n\n‘Chelsea can’t afford another slip-up like the one against Leeds. If that happens, they won’t finish inside the top five!’\n\nHis Prediction: Chelsea 3-0 Burnley.",

    "fullText": "Mets predicted to trade for $100M Gold Glove winner to pair with Juan Soto, Luis Robert Jr. originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New York Mets appeared to be headed for a quiet offseason, but things quickly heated up. New York struck a surprise deal with Bo Bichette — a player the Philadelphia Phillies believed they were close to landing. The agreement came shortly after the Mets missed out on Kyle Tucker.\n\n“The New York Mets, in a quick pivot after failing to sign Kyle Tucker, have agreed to a three-year, $126 million contract with infielder Bo Bichette, sources confirmed to ESPN on Friday,” ESPN’s Jorge Castillo wrote.\n\nNew York also strengthened its outfield by trading for Luis Robert Jr. from the Chicago White Sox. The move added another power bat to the lineup alongside Juan Soto and signaled that the Mets were not content to stand pat.\n\n“The New York Mets acquired center fielder Luis Robert Jr. in a trade with the Chicago White Sox late Tuesday, adding a strong defensive presence with a high-upside offensive game as they reshape their roster after a disappointing 2025,” ESPN’s Jeff Passan wrote.\n\nStill, the Mets may not be finished adding talent. FanSided’s Mark Powell believes New York could pursue a trade for veteran outfielder Byron Buxton.\n\n“Much like the Phillies, adding as much firepower into the batting order is necessary. The Mets had a disappointing 2025 season, fell short of the MLB postseason and now have to figure out how to contend in 2026. The Mets added Juan Soto last offseason as their big addition and now they need to replace Pete Alonso's bat. Buxton seems like the perfect option,” Powell wrote.\n\nThe Mets are clearly pushing to rebound after last season’s shortcomings. With several key free agents departing, New York has been aggressive in replacing that production — whether through pitching upgrades or adding power to the lineup.\n\nBuxton would represent a major addition, potentially giving the Mets three highly reliable bats in the middle of their order. Given how aggressive New York has been this offseason, if an opportunity to acquire Buxton presents itself, there’s little reason to believe they wouldn’t explore getting a deal done.",

He has a great mentality,\" Fuchs said.\n\n\"That mentality can be infectious as well, he carried a lot of players with him, he infected them with his mentality.

    "fullText": "Major League Soccer (MLS) kicks off its 31st season this weekend, ushering in another high-stakes campaign in a World Cup year.\n\nLionel Messi leads Inter Miami CF into the new term as they defend their 2025 MLS Cup crown against 29 rivals.\n\nIt has been 32 years since the United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, two years before the launch of MLS in 1996. Now, three decades later, MLS bids to become one of the world’s most exciting leagues.\n\nIn addition to Messi, several other elite stars are chasing the most prestigious piece of silverware in North American football, including LAFC’s Heung-min Son and Vancouver Whitecaps’ Thomas Muller.\n\nBoth are back for their first full season in MLS after making waves in their first campaign across the Atlantic upon arrival last summer.\n\nMLS has undergone profound changes since its inception in 1996, with all ten teams that launched the league towards the end of the 21st century still competing at the highest level.\n\nHowever, it’s worth noting that each of those ten sides has changed its name, crest, or both over time. MLS has been constantly evolving in recent decades, yet a historic change is on the horizon this time.\n\nMLS will stage its final full season under the traditional spring-to-fall format this year before switching to Europe’s summer-to-spring calendar in the summer of 2027.\n\nTo facilitate the transition, the league will introduce a shortened 14-game campaign from February to May next year before fully adopting the new schedule.\n\nFrom next season onwards, MLS will align its calendar with top European leagues such as the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A, marking the beginning of a new era.\n\nOn February 22–23, MLS kicks off its “MLS Is Back” weekend, with all 30 clubs taking the field.\n\nReigning champions Inter Miami could not have imagined a more challenging way to kick off their title defence, as they head to BMO Stadium to take on star-studded LAFC on the opening weekend.\n\nJavier Mascherano’s charges will play their inaugural match at Miami Freedom Park on April 5 against Austin FC.\n\nWith the 2026 World Cup set to unfold on American soil, MLS pause its season from May 26 to July 16 to make room for the world’s most prestigious international tournament.\n\nSince 11 cities will host the event, a number of club training facilities will be taken over by participating national teams, forcing the league officials to schedule a mid-season break.\n\nOn July 17–18, MLS resumes competition with marquee rivalry fixtures, including a mouth-watering derby between Los Angeles Galaxy and LAFC at Dignity Health Sports Park.\n\nOn July 30, MLS hosts the MLS All-Star Game in Charlotte.\n\nFinally, on November 7, Decision Day brings the regular season to a close as teams battle to secure play-off positioning.\n\nHistory beckons for Inter Miami as they could become only the third team in MLS history to win back-to-back titles following their maiden triumph last year.\n\nNeedless to say, all eyes will be on eight-time Ballon d’Or winner Messi, who reigned supreme during Inter’s title-winning campaign, bagging a jaw-dropping 35 goals in 34 league matches.\n\nMessi might be the Herons’ standout star, but Mascherano’s squad also features other high-profile names, like Sergio Busquets, Sergio Reguilon, Luis Suarez and Rodrigo De Paul.\n\nFurthermore, Inter shelled out $15 million to sign former Atletico Madrid striker German Berterame from CF Monterrey in January, further increasing an already intimidating firepower.\n\nIf there’s a side capable of challenging Inter’s dominance, it’s LAFC.\n\nSon’s arrival from Tottenham Hotspur last summer transformed Marc Dos Santos’ team into one of the deadliest attacking units in North American football, let alone MLS.\n\nThe South Korean megastar has forged a formidable partnership with Denis Bouanga. Together, they accounted for 25 goals and eight assists, emerging as the division’s most prolific duo alongside Messi and Suarez.\n\nBouanga and Son may no longer have to create chances for themselves alone after LAFC secured the services of Stephen Eustaquio from Porto earlier in February.\n\nIndeed, the skilled midfielder has moved to BMO Stadium on a season-long loan and will try to help the Black and Gold win the crown for the first time since 2022.\n\nElsewhere, Vancouver Whitecaps are bidding to replicate Toronto FC’s remarkable 2017 success and become the second Canadian franchise to lift the trophy.\n\nThough in the autumn of his illustrious playing career, Muller proved to be a game-changer for Jesper Sorensen’s side in the second half of last season, adding elite creativity and finishing touch to this exciting roster.\n\nMuller took MLS by storm upon arrival last summer, netting seven goals and adding three assists in seven appearances during the regular season to help his side reach the play-offs.\n\nDespite a 3-1 defeat to Inter in the grand final, the Whitecaps demonstrated they can compete with the league’s elite and will look to turn that painful lesson into fuel for a genuine title push in 2026.\n\nMessi has elevated MLS to another level since leaving Paris Saint-Germain to join Inter in 2023, and the 38-year-old icon looks set to remain the focal point of attention throughout the upcoming campaign.\n\nUnparalleled in his influence and output, La Pulga continues to set the standard across the league, and there’s no doubt that he will be the cornerstone of Inter’s title defence.\n\nWhile many players would settle for leaving in the shadow of Son, Bouanga has often found a way to outshine his more esteemed teammate, emerging as one of the league’s fiercest strikers.\n\nBouanga was unstoppable last season, tallying 26 goals and nine assists in 34 league games, and he will be the one to keep an eye on this year despite Son’s presence.\n\nIt’s a World Cup year, and a player who made his mark on football’s biggest international stage over a decade ago is perfectly poised to make his American soccer debut.\n\nJames Rodriguez is the man in question. The 36-year-old has joined Minnesota United following a lacklustre spell at Leon and will look to roll back the years after rising to global superstardom at the 2014 World Cup.\n\nA landmark change this year sees every MLS match available at no extra charge to Apple TV subscribers in over 100 countries — the standalone MLS Season Pass has been discontinued in favour of inclusion within the base streaming service, with no blackouts for viewers.\n\nOpening weekend highlights include a marquee Walmart Saturday Showdown clash between LAFC and Inter Miami at the iconic LA Memorial Coliseum, with traditional Sunday Night Soccer continuing the primetime slate.\n\nApple’s expanded coverage also introduces enhanced broadcasts and features like dynamic “Shot on iPhone” angles, aiming to deepen engagement across the regular season, Leagues Cup, All-Star Game, and Audi MLS Cup Playoffs, making 2026 a watershed year for global accessibility of MLS.\n\nFor more live streaming information, see our football live streaming page.",

    "fullText": "Clubs across the world are growing frustrated with FIFA over delays in distributing £185 million in promised solidarity payments from last summer’s Club World Cup, per The Guardian.\n\nFIFA had pledged that clubs that did not take part in the expanded tournament would still receive a share of the revenue, ensuring the benefits filtered down beyond the elite.\n\nHowever, more than seven months after the competition concluded, there is still no confirmed timeline for when the money will arrive or clarity on how it will be divided.\n\nThe total solidarity pot stands at £185m. If shared equally, it would equate to roughly £50,000 per top-flight club worldwide.\n\nWhile that figure may seem modest compared to the £740m in prize money distributed, with winners Chelsea earning around £84m, for many smaller clubs it could prove transformative.\n\nIn leagues where television deals are shrinking or even non-existent, a five-figure payment can be the difference between balancing the books and serious financial strain.\n\nExecutives from smaller European leagues say they have repeatedly sought answers from FIFA but have received no clear clarification on when funds will be released.\n\nThere is no suggestion that FIFA will not pay the money. Instead, the delay appears to stem from ongoing discussions over how to split the £185m between the six continental confederations.\n\nRepresentation at the Club World Cup varied, complicating attempts to create a fair formula. Also, several confederations lack established systems for distributing such funds.\n\nIn Europe, UEFA is expected to use a model similar to its existing solidarity payments for clubs that miss out on the group stages of European competition.\n\nBut until final figures are agreed, no distribution can begin.\n\nThe tournament’s last-minute funding arrangements have not helped.\n\nA £787m broadcast deal with DAZN was only finalised months before kick-off, leaving little time to establish a detailed pay-out structure.\n\nFor football’s smaller clubs, the wait continues and patience is wearing thin.",

    "fullText": "OXFORD — Ole Miss women's basketball coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin had a simple explanation to an eye-popping statistic.\n\nThe Rebels shot 0-for-17 from the field in the fourth quarter and lost 78-70 to LSU Feb. 19 despite entering the fourth quarter with a 63-54 lead.\n\n\"I'm not taking anything away from LSU, but we ran out of gas,\" McPhee-McCuin said. \"Seven points in the fourth (quarter), and it wasn't because we didn't take shots. We missed 17 shots. Around the basket.\"\n\nNo. 7 LSU (23-4, 9-4) ended the game on a 19-1 run. Star Tigers' guard MiLaysia Fulwiley scored 22 of her 26 points after halftime.\n\nLSU coach Kim Mulkey saw the same thing McPhee-McCuin did down the stretch. Her team had plenty of gas left in the tank.\n\n\"Speed,\" Mulkey said. \"I thought we were getting a lot of transition baskets. It starts with MiLaysia. She's just so quick, and it makes everyone else play quicker.\"\n\nNo. 17 Ole Miss (21-7, 8-5 SEC) has played in three games since Feb. 15, and was coming off one day of rest after beating Tennessee in Feb. 17 in a game that was rescheduled because of the ice storm.\n\nMcPhee-McCuin reiterated that she was proud of her team throughout her press conference. Star forward Cotie McMahon, who scored 25 points, echoed that sentiment.\n\n\"I feel like I'm really proud of this team, given the circumstances,\" McMahon said. \"Still trying to push through. I feel like we eventually did die out at the end. We were just trying to keep us going.\"\n\nMcMahon played all 40 minutes vs. Kentucky on Feb. 15 and 37 minutes vs. Tennessee on Feb. 17. She played 38 against the Tigers.\n\nMcMahon was 0-for-7 from the field in the fourth quarter and 2-for-4 at the free throw line.\n\nMcPhee-McCuin said fatigue is not an excuse, but it's a factor. She pointed out that Tennessee also lost on Feb. 19. The Lady Vols lost 82-74 to unranked Texas A&M.\n\n\"LSU won the game, so let me make that clear,\" McPhee-McCuin said. \"I don't want to be a coach that has excuses. I'm not a sore loser. It is what it is. If we won it would have really helped us.\"\n\nIt doesn't get an easier for Ole Miss, which plays at No. 3 South Carolina on Feb. 23 (11 a.m. CT, ESPN).\n\nSam Hutchens covers Ole Miss for the Clarion Ledger.

    "fullText": "Manchester United have reportedly set their sights on Bournemouth defender Marcos Senesi, who will become a free agent in the summer.\n\nThe Argentine is a San Lorenzo academy product who arrived in Europe through the gates of Feyenoord in 2019. After three years in the Netherlands, he signed for the Cherries in the summer of 2022, and has been a stalwart at the club ever since.\n\nBut while Bournemouth head coach Andoni Iraola described Senesi as ‘very valuable’, the latter is expected to leave the Vitality Stadium once his contract expires at the end of the season. This situation has piqued the interest of a host of European suitors, including Man Utd.\n\nAccording to Tuttosport, Juventus have offered the centre-back a four-year deal and a salary of €3 million per season.\n\nThe Turin-based newspaper believes that the Bianconeri are trying to secure a swift agreement with Senesi and his entourage to ward off the competition.\n\nMarcos Senesi and Bruno Fernandes (Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nThe source adds that several other European clubs are ‘keen’ to sign the Bournemouth man, including Man Utd. The other suitors are Barcelona, ​​Dortmund, Atlético Madrid, Brighton, and Crystal Palace.\n\nAs reported in recent days, United will be looking to add a new centre-back to their ranks, even if Harry Maguire ends up signing a new contract.\n\nSenesi represents a potential bargain for INEOS, as signing him on a free transfer and on affordable wages would allow them to allocate their transfer funds to other departments, especially the midfield.\n\nThe left-footed Senesi could be a back-up for his compatriot Lisandro Martinez. However, his arrival could reduce Ayden Heaven’s chances of earning playing time, which could prompt a loan move.\n\nIn any case, it remains to be seen if Man Utd’s reported interest in the Argentine will be confirmed by British sources, and whether the Red Devils will make concrete moves in the coming days and weeks.",

    "fullText": "The Football Interview is a new series in which the biggest names in sport and entertainment engage in bold and in-depth conversations about the nation's favourite sport.\n\nWe'll explore mindset and motivation, and talk about defining moments, career highs and personal reflections. The Football Interview brings you the person behind the player.\n\nInterviews will drop from Friday across BBC iPlayer, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website. This week's interview will be broadcast on BBC One from 23:40 GMT on Saturday, 21 February (and in Scotland at 00:55 on Sunday morning).\n\nMichael Carrick is certainly enjoying life as Manchester United caretaker head coach.\n\nSince Carrick replaced Ruben Amorim last month, United have taken 13 points from five matches to climb to fourth in the Premier League.\n\nThat included back-to-back wins over title rivals Manchester City and Arsenal en route to the 44-year-old being named Premier League manager of the month.\n\nMuch has been made of the former United midfielder's faith in 20-year-old academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo, who has gone from not starting a league match this season under Amorim to being a mainstay.\n\nIn an in-depth interview with Mark Chapman, Carrick refers to Mainoo as a \"huge talent\" and speaks more broadly about continuing the club's 88-year record of having an academy product in every matchday squad.\n\nHe also answers questions about his future, with his contract at Old Trafford only running until the end of the season.\n\nMark Chapman: The last time I saw you was on Match of the Day. Were those experiences so bad that you felt you just had to jump at a job that came your way?!\n\nMichael Carrick: I have to say, I really enjoyed it - seeing it from a different perspective, watching football in a different way. I enjoyed it, but this one was too good to turn down, unfortunately!\n\nMark: Take us back to the process of getting here - the first phone call that you got... what went through your head?\n\nMichael: I was actually in the car. I was driving on the way up to Newcastle at the time when the message came through. It was a nice thing to hear - of course it was - but I was quite calm about it actually.\n\nI don't know why, but it just felt right. And that's not me being arrogant or blase in any way - it just felt quite normal. You get a good feeling from it, but I've been here for so long and experienced so much that probably, at some point, I was always hoping in the back of my mind that the opportunity would come along - and thankfully it has.\n\nMark: You smiled, surely? And who did you ring after you put the phone down on that call?\n\nMichael: Listen, I was delighted obviously. To be at this club is special, so I'm not playing it down, but it wasn't the case that I came off the phone shouting and screaming and celebrating on the motorway or anything. I just called my wife and said, 'this is what's happened, this is where we're at'.\n\nMark: So when you agree to do it and you know the length of time that you're doing it for, what do you start preparing for? Your backroom staff? Had those calls already gone in?\n\nMichael: Obviously assessing what needs to be done, what needs to be put in place, what staff, what that balance looks like. And it's condensed into quite a short space of time. Putting the staff together was something that we had to get right and wanted to get right. So, I was really happy with that - how it came together... I was absolutely delighted with the staff.\n\nIt's about getting the best out of the players, isn't it? So, like you say, the first conversations... that first impression goes a long way. I've been on the other side when someone new comes in the room. My message, to be honest, was: 'I'm here to support you. I'm here to help you. We're here to push you.'\n\nUltimately, we want to get good results here, but there are ways of doing it and hopefully they've felt that support so far.\n\nMark: Did you think that they'd been underachieving as a group?\n\nMichael: It's not really to say whether they achieved or underachieved. For me, walking in the door, it was about what was in front of us and I knew it was a really talented group... a lot of potential within the group. It was just about what can we do to help and improve things. We had three days before we played Manchester City so it was a really condensed, compressed game-prep week with a lot of things going into it in a short space of time.\n\nMark: Did it help that it was Manchester City and Arsenal as the first two games?\n\nMichael: You could say it helped now...\n\nMark: But hindsight's a wonderful thing isn't it?\n\nMichael: Yeah. I think the fact that it was two massive games... City was a huge game - playing at home, and the atmosphere I have to say was pretty special on the day. Even building up to the game, you could feel it in and around the stadium before kick-off. It's impossible to describe how much that helps, but to feel that between everyone - it's a real special feeling for me to be in the position to be able to share that with so many people. That's probably the most satisfying thing so far - getting that connection and feeling that emotion from everyone in such a positive way.\n\nMark: With the three members of staff that you brought in - Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans - how do you work as a four? Because there was a lot of attention on the people you brought in...\n\nMichael: There's Travis as well - Travis Binnion, who's been here for a number of years now through the academy. And Craig Mawson - the goalkeeping coach. There's a really strong group and it feels like we've been together a long time, but we didn't all know each other. I didn't really know Steve personally an awful lot. I thought it would come together nicely and was balanced and there's a reason why I wanted to bring Steve in.\n\nJonathan... I had him at Middlesbrough - loyal, gets me, knows me, pushes me, challenges me... really good relationship. Jonny knew the club. He's been here so long and has a really good relationship with the players as well... loves coaching, loves helping, cares a lot. And then with Travis... the club needs the academy. It's a massive part of this football club.\n\nI think there's a really good balance with the responsibility of the academy, young players and then Jonathan and Jonny - being two of the best centre-backs you could come across in the last 20-25 years - to pass their information on.\n\nSteve - with his experience in so many ways... Chelsea, with change of managers and different styles of managers and top, top players, and England. All the staff are able to cope being around the environment and I think that's so important.\n\nMark: And they challenge you? They tell you when you're wrong?\n\nMark: Not every manager would accept that.\n\nMichael: I can't be right the whole time - it's impossible. That's why we've got a group of six in our office. We've all got strong opinions, but I think we all filter it and it's important that we have a connection and understanding of what direction we want to go in. We have to push each other, for sure.\n\nMark: You mention the academy. What does the academy mean to you?\n\nMichael: An awful lot. Listen, I've always kept that feeling of what it was like as a young player. It's something I've always had an eye on and been passionate about. With the tradition of this football club, it's natural to take that on. It's just as proud a moment as any to give a young player their debut and there's certainly a want - from not just me but all the staff and everyone at the club - to try and produce the young players and give them opportunities as much as we can.\n\nMark: A United academy player has always been in the first-team matchday squad since 1930-something, isn't it? Is that a sense of pride? How much can it become a slight millstone if you would be the one that breaks that run?\n\nMichael: Huge sense of pride on behalf of the whole football club, I think. It's really outstanding to have for such a long period of time and it's something we need to hold on to. It's what this football club is built upon really, and has been for so many decades. So, yeah, I'm definitely well aware of it and we want to carry it on.\n\nMark: When you watch the academy and you're watching the under-age teams as well... is the pipeline - and I'm not putting pressure on them - but is the academy in good health?\n\nMichael: Yeah, I think it's in great hands. I think it has been. I think historically here it's kept producing players, year after year. We always hope for the next group or the next individual. There's so much good work that goes into the academy.\n\nWe get carried away sometimes about the football and results. Where we're at now, it's wins and draws and losses that count in some ways. But it's about developing young people and behaviours and helping them. There are so many players from this club that have maybe not even made a debut here, but have moved on and had unbelievable careers in the game. And I think that's something, again, that as a football club we're really proud of.\n\nMark: So, following on from the academy chat, there's been so much noise around Kobbie Mainoo this season... and not featuring, and now he's featured all the time under you. What did you see when you first got to work with him? Mentally, how was he and how have you got to where he is at the moment?\n\nMichael: I've known Kobbie a long time. I started working with him when I think he was 13 or 14, when I was starting to do my coaching badges - a good few years ago. Just little bits. And then, obviously, when I was here the first time, he was in and around a little bit.\n\nSo I think knowing him and having experience with him and seeing him perform at such a level on such big occasions... I said earlier about coaches being able to cope with being here and at the level to deal with it. What Kobbie's done at such a young age is quite incredible really.\n\nWe forget how young he still is. I was just a big fan of watching him play and knowing what he was capable of. So it wasn't really a big decision to play him. And, to be fair, it's not easy when you haven't played to find your rhythm and find your form.\n\nThere are things he can get better at, things he can improve on, but we haven't really got started on any of that because we're just letting him go and find his flow and find his rhythm of playing football again. I've been really conscious of not giving him an awful lot - a couple of little pointers, a bit of positional things and some little bits here and there - but trust in what he is. He's a fantastic footballer and he's got a huge talent.\n\nMark: It sounds, in many ways, that you rely on on the human being side of things rather than - I don't mean this in a disparaging way - rather than a flipchart.\n\nMichael: I like being around people. I like to share things. I'm not one that would be an individual as such and I don't promote the fact that I've got all the answers. I'm quite happy to discuss that. I think getting the best out of people - whether that's in the industry of TV or in the industry of sport or business... I think treating people with respect. I think that whatever it is, the technical side, tactical side, we can get better at all that, but if you haven't got a connection and that buy-in and that willingness to want to come with you and follow you, then all the other bits kind of lose their value and you don't get to fulfil all that potential. So I see it as a massive, massive thing to get that connection with people.\n\nMichael: I haven't yet, no. There's a time for all sorts of emotions and that's the beauty of being in this position - you've got to pick the right time and tap on the right kinds of buttons to get the right reactions.\n\nMark: When you witnessed the hairdryer [which Sir Alex Ferguson's fiery outbursts became known as] were you like: 'Crikey'?\n\nMichael: Yeah, I'm not sure I could replicate that! I wouldn't try to! A couple of times I've seen it and it puts you at the back of your seat, trying to get further away from it. But, again, you're talking about Sir Alex and he was the genius at using people and getting the best out of people in so many different ways - support, pushing, a bit stronger than pushing at times - but it worked. It was all about getting the best out of his players.\n\nMark: Who are the managers that you played for that you look to incorporate now in what you're doing?\n\nMichael: There's a few times I've done something and then it's not until after that I remember something that happened years ago with different managers or coaches. Experience is a beautiful thing to draw upon in different ways and that's just life. Listen, Sir Alex had the biggest impact on me - I think that's pretty obvious to say because of everything we achieved here. But I think just learning and knowing that I've never got all the answers and to just keep searching for more experience. That's why the staff are there to help in that regard.\n\nMark: A lot of the players from that era are now pundits - in the same way that when you were playing, a lot of the successful Liverpool team were pundits. Do you have to accept it and shut it out? And is that easier for you than it is for your younger players?\n\nMichael: It doesn't bother me one bit. Genuinely, it doesn't. I'm not going to really fall out with anyone over that. I think it's a respect thing as much as anything and I'll give and take that. I think for younger players in general it's something we need to help them with and look after them. It's a different world now to when, say, I was coming through, but we do that and we look after them.\n\nMark: If I were to ask you if you wanted it [the job] beyond... I know you'll have a stock answer, but I also think you're probably very much just 'what will be will be' are you?\n\nMichael: It's not a stock answer - for me, it's the ultimate role. I'm really enjoying it, I love what I'm doing. I'm fortunate. I feel privileged to be in the position I am, but it's not the fact that I believe I can do it and I'm here to do it.\n\nI said it when I came in - there's the sentimental side of that... of understanding the role and coming through the club and being here and loving the club and being a supporter and all that side of it is one thing. But, actually, I'm here to do a job now and to make a good team and be successful.\n\nI don't decide how long that's going to be but I love being here and and while I'm here, I'll give everything I can. And I always plan for the long-term future for the benefit of the football club. That's how I believe it should be.\n\nMark: And you're very happy, aren't you?\n\nMichael: Yeah. Have I smiled enough for you?!\n\nMichael: I'm loving what I'm doing. Again, you know... really good people. The staff are fantastic, the players have been unbelievable. It's a really good place to come in every single day - to drive in and look forward to being here. And then, obviously, around the city and globally, the reaction and the support that you get - it's very hard to describe it. It's incredible. So, yeah, I'm delighted to be here.\n\nMark: But if people keep asking you that, then you might shout at them?\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Cavaliers star Donovan Mitchell would welcome LeBron James back to Cleveland with open arms.",
    "fullText": "Right now, the hot rumor about LeBron James' immediate future is that he will leave the Los Angeles Lakers this summer and go back to the Cleveland Cavaliers, the team he started his career with, this summer. He, of course, played his first seven NBA seasons with Cleveland, then came back for four more seasons after a four-year stint with the Miami Heat and led it to its first championship in 2016.\n\nThe Akron, Ohio native will be a free agent after the conclusion of this season. According to sources, Cavaliers star Donovan Mitchell and new Cavaliers guard James Harden will try to recruit James and bring him back to Northeast Ohio.\n\nMitchell went on Sirius XM NBA Radio recently and chimed in on the possibility of the league's all-time leading career scorer becoming his teammate next season.\n\n“As a Bron fan, to be able to be a teammate, that would obviously be special, but that’s not something is my control. I control what we got here. There’s always going to be reports, that’s natural, it’s gonna be a thing. At the end of the day, to your point, my main focus right now is trying to get this championship. And whatever happens, it happens. That’s not up to me, that’s not up to anybody else in the locker room. So I’m big on believing what I can control. But yeah, it’s LeBron James, right?”\n\nThe Cavaliers made multiple moves prior to the Feb. 5 trade deadline that will allow them to get under the second apron of the salary cap this summer. As of now, they could only offer James a minimum salary, but they could possibly make a couple more moves to open up their taxpayer mid-level exception, which is expected to be roughly $6 million.\n\nNo matter how much James makes on his next NBA contract, he could make substantially more by holding a farewell tour. Anthony Lima of Cleveland's 92.3 The Fan posted on X (formerly Twitter) that the future Hall of Famer could rake in as much as $70 million by selling the streaming rights to that farewell tour.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Donovan Mitchell: It would 'be special' to be teammates with LeBron",

In the divorce proceedings, she asked that I take responsibility for half of a loan that she “cosigned” for our son‘s education. I was aware of the loan, but not privy to the details and, certainly, not aware that it was a loan of $100,000 at 7%-plus interest. Previously, she had indicated to me that it was a much smaller amount so the actual terms came as a surprise.State law does not require me to assume such a debt, and it remained hers after the divorce. In the past year, I have discovered that it was a Parent PLUS loan, which means it is her debt alone. Minimum payments are $700 a month. She makes this payment and our son contributes $200 to her each month. Our son makes $45,000 a year and has no immediate prospects for significantly increasing his income in the near future.",

EVMbench is based on 120 vulnerability types found in 40 different security audits (including several from Tempo blockchain) and will include scenarios involving payment-oriented smart contract code related to expected agentic stablecoin transactions.\n\nIntroducing EVMbench—a new benchmark that measures how well AI agents can detect, exploit, and patch high-severity smart contract vulnerabilities. https://t.co/op5zufgAGH\n\nEVMbench measures each artificial intelligence (AI) agent’s performance in three ways:\n\nEach test is conducted by using an Anvil-based, Rust-language harness to provide a deterministic and reproducible means of evaluating agents within isolated environments rather than live networks.\n\nAI’s Frontier models (the most recent ones) have performed significantly better than those measured six months ago. For example, GPT-5.3-Codex’s average performance on exploit tasks is 72.2%, while its predecessor model (GPT-5) had only 31.9% on the same exploits. Detect and patch modes remain more challenging to agents as they often stop their audit process after finding the first fault or have difficulties maintaining the perfect functionality of the contract while also removing vulnerabilities.\n\nnew collab from @paradigm and @OpenAI:\n\nevmbench is a benchmark and agent harness for exploiting smart contract bugs\n\na few months ago, the best models found <20% of critical, fund-draining @Code4rena bugs in our benchmark. today they find > 70% https://t.co/soOrCR38eO pic.twitter.com/2lr0WUVo2Q\n\nEVMbench tackles both sides of AI use in cybersecurity: monitoring new threats while encouraging defensive applications. As part of this initiative, OpenAI recently committed $10M of Application Programming Interface (API) credits through its Cybersecurity Grant Program to help boost efforts toward creating more defensive research and expanding Aardvark’s (its open-source security research agent) footprint with a private beta test.",

    "title": "Russia Eyes Balloon Communications System After Losing Starlink",
    "description": "SpaceX has cut off Russia's access to Starlink and now Moscow is scrambling to find a replacement.",
    "fullText": "Russia is developing a new balloon-borne system that could provide battlefield access to high-speed data communications at a time when its forces are desperate to keep connected. The testing of the Barrage-1 balloon comes as Ukrainian troops are taking advantage of Russia’s loss of access to the SpaceX Starlink satellite constellation network. Both sides have become dependent on the SpaceX system for daily wartime operations, but the restrictions on Russia’s use of Starlink are allowing Kyiv’s forces to fend off attacks in some areas while advancing in others. You can read more about Russia’s Starlink troubles in our initial story here.\n\nAs we previously noted, the introduction of Starlink to the battlefield in Ukraine revolutionized how war is waged, giving users high bandwidth, relatively secure communications basically anywhere, all in a small, off-the-shelf package. Though Elon Musk’s SpaceX company provided them to Ukraine, Russians soon came to rely on them as well. However, earlier this month, the company created a list of verified users, cutting Russia off from the system and throwing its troops into disarray. We will talk more about that later in this story.\n\n#Russia \n🇷🇺🛰 War challenges create new demands – Barrage 1 \nIs Barrage 1 a counterpart to Starlink? Essentially yes, but the concept is a bit different.\nThe project is being developed jointly by Aerodrommash and MSTU-Moscow State Technical University.\nConcept: An autonomous… pic.twitter.com/yZP7jmRk65\n\nThe Barrage-1 balloon recently underwent its first test flight, according to Russia’s Foundation for Advanced Studies (FFAS), which is developing the system. It “is designed to carry up to 100 kilograms (about 220 pounds) of payload at an altitude of up to 20 kilometers (about 12 miles),” FFAS recently announced on Telegram. One of the payloads being considered is “a promising 5G NTN terrestrial communication equipment, the testing of which is planned for the near future,” the organization claimed.\n\nWhile not reaching anywhere near the low earth orbit (LEO) altitudes as the Starlink constellation – between 341 miles to 298 miles – Barrage-1 could still serve as an alternative access point for high-speed data transfer for troops on ground below.\n\nRegardless of FFAS intentions, however, even if it is perfected, the Barrage-1 system will not provide the same level of coverage as Starlink, which is made up of thousands of laser datalink-connected satellites covering the globe. In contrast, Barrage-1 will be guided by “a pneumatic ballast system, which allows changing the flight altitude to utilize wind currents and move in the desired direction.”\n\n“Due to this, the platform can maneuver and stay in a specified area or move along the trajectory required for the payload,” FFAS claimed, despite being in the very earliest stages of testing.\n\nRussia has launched an aerostat with a 5G communication platform, designed to remain in the stratosphere at an altitude of 20–30 km.\nThe “Barrage-1” can apparently adjust its altitude using a pneumatic ballast system, enabling it to use different winds to maintain its position.\n1 https://t.co/MCFKyTIskv pic.twitter.com/MzQIKnvNWg\n\nYou can read all about how high-altitude balloons can stay on station even in the presence of prevailing winds in this past story of ours.\n\nEven though it wouldn’t be a direct match to Starlink, at 12 miles high, it could provide wide-area connectivity similar to that offered by Starlink, albeit over a much more limited area. A mini ‘constellation’ of these systems spread over a region and mesh-networked together, could help solve the line of sight limitations of a single balloon.\n\nUkrainian Defense Ministry (MoD) advisor on defense technology and drone and electronic warfare (EW) expert Serhiy “Flash” Beskrestnov sees potential in this system.\n\n“The platform is seen as an accessible and efficient alternative to expensive satellite constellations in LEO,” Beskrestnov explained on Telegram. “One of the priority tasks for ‘Barrage’ will be to test 5G NTN communication. Placing transmitters at an altitude of 20 km will allow providing high-speed internet and communication to vast territories where the construction of ground towers is impossible.”\n\n“In theory and in practice, by controlling the altitude of an aerostat, it can be steered, not precisely, but enough to stay over any territory,” he added.\n\nHowever, the Barrage-1’s comparatively low altitudes could make them targets for Ukrainian air defense systems and other countermeasures.\n\n“And what’s most important for us? To have the means that can detect such objects over our territory,” Beskrestnov suggested. “And to have the ability to shoot down such targets if they pose a threat. As far as I remember, the S-300 [surface to air missile system] can engage targets at an altitude of 20-30 km (about 12 to 19 miles).”\n\nStill, successfully targeting and engaging a balloon with a small radar signature using SAMs are two different things. Russia worked on this exact problem extensively during the Cold War, which you can read about here.\n\nThe balloons could also fall victim to other forms of attack. It isn’t hard to imagine Ukraine producing a drone to specifically hunt for these systems at longer ranges. Their emissions would make them hard to hide. Also, the electronic warfare aspect is worth noting for the same reasons.\n\nThe concept of using balloons as communications nodes is far from new. It has been around for many years. The U.S. military continues to eye using balloons to lug communications relays and gateways aloft as well. As we previously noted, the U.S. once even considered sending balloons over Cuba with equipment that would allow citizens to have access after the government cut it off. For homeland applications, high altitude balloons have been eyed to replace cellular towers, especially after natural disasters have wiped-out ground-based communications.\n\nThe SpaceX restrictions have impacted everything from Russia’s high-level command and control, to basic communications and data exchange between troops across the entire battlespace. It has also affected Russia’s drone warfare, including interfering with long-range aerial weapons and uncrewed ground vehicles (UGV). The Kyiv Post article claims that some Russian UGVs have relied on Starlink to operate.\n\n“The loss of Starlink has now forced Russian military logistics troops to return to the use of manned trucks, cars, motorcycles or quad-cycle vehicles,” noted Mick Ryan, a retired Australian major general now serving as a military analyst. “These have proven to be more vulnerable to drone strikes.”\n\n\"Eventually shock wears off, responses are developed & counterpunches delivered. This will be the case with the Starlink shutdown. Ukraine will have limited time to exploit the opportunities of the degraded C2 environment now endured by Russian ground forces.\"… pic.twitter.com/zytWvgdtFw\n\nLosing Starlink has slowed down Russian offensive actions and increased their casualties while opening up opportunities for Ukraine to advance, Ukrainian military officials have claimed.\n\n“For three to four days after the shutdown, they really reduced the assault operations,”  Lt. Denis Yaroslavsky, who commands a special reconnaissance unit for the Ukraine Armed Forces, told the New York Post.\n\n“The disruption comes as Russia suffers its worst death rate since the start of the four-year-old war,” U.S. and Ukrainian intelligence officials told the publication.\n\n27:1 fatality ratio. Putin sowed the wind, and is reaping the whirlwind. pic.twitter.com/9NKDajLpvL\n\nRussian sources concurred that restrictions on Starlink use are having major negative effects on the frontlines.\n\n“As a result” of the SpaceX action, “instead of a planned strike against the enemy, where their (meaning ours) communications are instantly cut off while theirs remains operational, we have a hellish mess,” Andrey Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Moscow City Duma and Deputy Director General for Radio Broadcasting of the VGTRK television and radio company, stated on Telegram.\n\nCompounding problems created for Russia by the restrictions on Starlink, the launch of its own satellite constellation system has reportedly been delayed by about a year.\n\n“The Russian aerospace company Bureau 1440 announced the postponement of its initial deployment of 16 high-speed internet satellites,” the SatNews media outlet recently reported. “Originally scheduled for late 2025, the launch of the first batch for the ‘Rassvet’ (Dawn) Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation has been rescheduled for 2026.”\n\nSeen as a domestic alternative to Starlink, the program has been plagued by manufacturing shortfalls.\n\n“While Roscosmos Chief Dmitry Bakanov stated in September 2025 that deployment of the first 300 satellites would begin by the end of that year, industry sources now indicate that the production line has failed to meet the necessary volume,” SatNews noted. “Despite the delay, Deputy Minister of Digital Development Dmitry Ugnivenko had claimed as recently as December 2025 that all 16 initial satellites were complete. Bureau 1440 currently has only six experimental satellites in orbit, launched during the Rassvet-1 and Rassvet-2 missions to test laser inter-satellite links and 5G signal compatibility.”\n\nEven if it is launched, the Rassvet satellite constellation, which will take years to become operational, is very unlikely to have the same capabilities as Starlink.\n\n17/ \"This is the Rassvet project from Bureau 1440. According to the announced plans, the launch of the first 16 low-orbit broadband internet satellites was supposed to take place in 2025 , but this never happened. pic.twitter.com/Ro2iWyAEtd\n\nAmid all these issues, Russia is struggling to find more immediate ways to overcome the Starlink restrictions.\n\n“There are no alternatives [to Starlink] right now – at least not at the level of today,” the Russian Colonelcassad Telegram channel explained. It added that Russia is looking for workarounds, but nothing appears to be imminent.\n\nThe Russian Gazprom Space Systems satellite array is not a viable alternative at the moment, Colonelcassad rightfully noted.\n\n“There is Gazprom’s dish, it works, but, to put it mildly, it lags behind in connection speed and needs development or refinement,” he stated. “Of course, it is technically possible to provide high-speed internet in the fields by other methods, which many are currently working on.”\n\nThe long-term effect of the SpaceX decision on Starlink remains to be seen. This war has shown that both sides advance quickly when it comes to battlefield technology and Russia will have to find some kind of a workaround. However, for Moscow, the timing of the Starlink restrictions is not good, considering that the latest round of peace talks are currently underway in Switzerland. Russian President Vladimir Putin is sticking to his stance that Ukraine turn over territory in the eastern part of the country it still holds, something Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told Axios that the public won’t allow. Losing ground on the battlefield takes away an important bargaining chip for Russia.\n\nContact the author: howard@thewarzone.com",

    "fullText": "What really struck me reading this is how quickly the problem shifts from model capability to organisational design.\n\nOnce AI can reliably handle multi-step work, the hard question stops being which system is smartest and becomes how companies actually structure delegation, supervision, and accountability when the “worker” is software.\n\nIt feels like a lot of organisations are still treating this as a tooling decision, when in practice it’s already becoming an operating model question. We’re seeing that shift happen pretty quickly inside enterprise teams now.\n\nLove this! One thing I'd add is that while Gemini has the weakest general-purpose harness, the NotebookLM + Gemini integration is powerful (especially paired with Google's significantly larger context windows).\n\nPreviously, when my notebook couldn't answer something because it wasn't in my sources, I had to leave NotebookLM, search elsewhere, and reconcile manually. Now Gemini lets me combine my uploaded sources with live web information in a single conversation.\n\nFor podcast pre-production, I upload a guest's book, previous interviews, and biography into NotebookLM, then attach that notebook to Gemini and ask it to cross-reference my sources with their most recent public statements or interviews I haven't captured yet — so I can spot where their thinking has shifted and prepare sharper questions.\n\nFor lesson & curriculum design, I upload curriculum standards, past lesson plans, and student feedback. NotebookLM synthesizes gaps and aligns objectives, then in Gemini I can ask it to find current news / real-world examples from the web that bring a specific learning objective to life; without losing the grounding in my actual materials.",

    "fullText": "Meta is dialing back the metaverse to mean something far less futuristic: an app on your phone.\n\nThe company, which spent billions of dollars to build Horizon Worlds — an immersive, virtual hangout zone on its Quest virtual reality headsets — is \"shifting focus\" for Horizon Worlds \"to be almost exclusively mobile,\" according to a blog post published on Thursday.\n\nHorizon Worlds is part of Meta's Reality Labs division for VR products and smart glasses, a unit that has burned nearly $80 billion since 2020.\n\n\"Last year, we began to experiment with Worlds as a mobile platform, and we saw positive momentum,\" wrote Samantha Ryan, Meta's vice president of content at Reality Labs. \"Now, to truly change the game and tap into a much larger market, we're going all-in on mobile.\"\n\nThe move signals how dramatically Meta has redrawn its VR ambitions.\n\nLast month, Meta laid off roughly 10% of Reality Labs employees, closed three VR gaming studios it owned, and stopped releasing new content for Supernatural, a popular VR fitness app it acquired in 2023.\n\nMeta said it is still committed to virtual reality hardware and supporting third-party developers who create games for it.\n\n\"We're in it for the long haul,\" Ryan wrote, and pointed to the company's \"robust roadmap of future VR headsets tailored to different audience segments.\"\n\nMeta invested nearly $150 million in VR developer platforms in 2025, Ryan wrote, and she said that popular games like \"The Thrill of the Fight 2,\" \"Hard Bullet,\" and \"UG\" had earned \"millions\" in revenue.\n\nStill, she wrote that 86% of the time people spend in Meta's headsets is in third-party apps, not its own. The pivot to mobile effectively pits Horizon Worlds against entrenched competitors like Roblox and Fortnite that cater to casual mobile gamers rather than VR enthusiasts with headsets.\n\nOn Meta's latest earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg pitched Horizon as the natural home for \"immersive 3D\" content: AI-generated scenes, objects, and mini experiences. Now, rather than putting on a headset, people could just spin up that content with a prompt and then share it straight into Instagram, Facebook, or Threads, he said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "New York's governor dropped a proposal to allow unmanned robotaxis, days after Waymo raised $16 billion to fund its expansion to more cities in the US.",
    "fullText": "The autonomous vehicle industry just faced a setback in New York.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul dropped a proposal to allow robotaxi companies to operate commercially without human safety drivers in parts of the state outside New York City, dealing a blow not just to Waymo but also to its competitors eager to crack one of the world's largest taxi markets.\n\nThe proposal, which Hochul introduced last month as part of her budget plan, would have created a framework for limited robotaxi deployments elsewhere in the state while leaving any decision about New York City to the mayor and city council.\n\nBased on the proposal, private companies like Waymo and Tesla would be able to operate their commercial robotaxis if they could obtain approval from local governments. On Thursday, the governor's office confirmed that the plan had been withdrawn after failing to gain legislative support.\n\nThe move is a blow to Waymo, which has eyed New York, especially New York City, for years as a potential growth market. Waymo is currently testing vehicles with safety drivers in New York City under a permit approved during former Mayor Eric Adams' administration, though that permit expires March 31. It is unclear if Mayor Zohran Mamdani will agree to renew the permit.\n\nIn a blog post on Monday, Waymo said it raised $16 billion in its most recent funding round, which valued the company at $126 billion. The investment would be used to finance the company's expansion to over 20 more cities, said Waymo.\n\nAccording to state lobbying records, the Alphabet-owned company has been lobbying Hochul, state senators, state assembly members, as well as Blake Washington, who is the state's budget director, over the past six months. Other companies that are developing robotaxis don't have notable lobbying records specific to New York.\n\nNew York law allows autonomous vehicles only if a human safety driver keeps their hands on the steering wheel. Earlier versions of the law even required a police escort, but that provision was later removed.\n\nAutonomous vehicle makers have struggled to gain a foothold in New York. Cruise shelved plans to test in Manhattan in 2017 before the company folded entirely, while Optimus Ride and Mobileye have run limited pilots. None has thus far managed to provide unsupervised commercial rides in the Big Apple.\n\nThere are other active bills that would allow robotaxis to run in the state if such plans could gain enough legislative support. Brian A. Cunningham, who represents the 43rd Assembly District in Central Brooklyn, has sponsored a bill that would allow a person or a company to operate a fully autonomous vehicle on the public roads without a human driver, \"provided that the automated driving system is engaged and the vehicle meets certain conditions.\"\n\nThe bill in question was first referred to the Committee of Transportation on January 7. Based on state lobbying records, Waymo lobbyists met with Cunningham between November and December 2025.\n\nWaymo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump says he is directing federal agencies to declassify UFO files. For traders betting on aliens, that could mean a very earthly payday.\n\n\"Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post on Thursday night.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Trump took aim at former President Barack Obama, accusing him of improperly discussing classified material when speaking about extraterrestrial life on a recent podcast.\n\nTrump told reporters aboard Air Force One that Obama \"gave classified information\" and wasn't \"supposed to be doing that,\" adding that he could get him \"out of trouble\" by declassifying the relevant files.\n\nObama said in a tongue-in-cheek exchange with podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen last week that aliens are \"real\" and that they're not \"being kept\" at Area 51. He later clarified in an Instagram post that there was no evidence during his presidency that aliens \"have made contact with us.\"\n\nAliens have always had a niche following. In prediction markets, aliens are tradable assets.\n\nOn the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket, guessing about aliens has become a high-volume betting category. Traders have poured millions of dollars into whether the US will confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life.\n\nOne of the platform's largest markets asks whether the US will confirm that aliens exist before 2027. The market has drawn more than $4 million in trading volume as of Thursday.\n\nBetting activity has also centered on whether a Trump administration would declassify UFO files before 2027, with odds climbing above 80% in December.\n\nPolymarket users also placed bets on other extraterrestrial theories, including whether mysterious drones spotted over New Jersey were aliens.\n\nIf the files are released and contain anything definitive, longtime alien bettors may finally cash in.\n\nIn November 2024, unidentified drones were seen flying at night over New Jersey and other East Coast states.\n\nThe mysterious sightings unsettled residents and drew questions from local officials, fueling a wave of speculation about what — or who — was in the sky. Alien theories quickly gained traction.\n\nAt that time, Trump said the government \"knows what is happening\" but wasn't sharing it.\n\n\"For some reason, they don't want to comment. I think they'd be better off saying what it is. Our military knows, and our president knows, and for some reason, they want to keep people in suspense,\" he said at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\"Something strange is going on,\" he added.\n\nA Facebook group titled \"New Jersey Mystery Drones — let's solve it\" has grown to more than 81,000 members as of writing. Users in the group continue to float the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement, alongside speculation about commercial or military craft.",

    "description": "Gold's volatility has pushed central banks to the sidelines, despite their long-term bullish stance.",
    "fullText": "Gold's historic rally sidelined one of its biggest buyers — but they're eyeing a comeback, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe precious metal has been on a red-hot run over the past year, hitting a record high above $5,500 per ounce late last month before a sharp correction.\n\nWhile gold's rise has been buoyed by central bank buying in recent years, sharp price swings have temporarily slowed that demand.\n\n\"Our conversations suggest that reserve managers remain willing buyers of gold to hedge geopolitical and financial risks but prefer to delay purchases until prices stabilize,\" Goldman commodity analysts Lina Thomas and Daan Struyven wrote in a note on Thursday.\n\nThe elevated volatility was driven by private-sector diversification demand — much of it expressed through gold call-option structures that amplify price moves.\n\nThat volatility has made some emerging-market central banks more hesitant to step in aggressively at current levels, even as they remain structurally bullish.\n\nCentral banks bought roughly 1,000 metric tons of gold on a net basis in 2023 and 2024, according to the World Gold Council. That dipped to around 900 tons in 2025, but they bought at higher prices compared to the past two years.\n\nSpot gold was trading around $4,995 per troy ounce in early Friday trade. Prices are up about 16% so far this year.\n\nThe structural backdrop, Goldman's analysts argued, hasn't changed. Since the freezing of Russia's reserves over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, central banks have reassessed the risks of holding dollar assets and started buying gold as an alternative.\n\nIn its base case — which assumes no additional surge in private-sector diversification — Goldman expects volatility to moderate and central-bank buying to reaccelerate, broadly in line with the pace seen in 2025.\n\nTogether with incremental private-investor demand tied to potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, that could push gold to $5,400 an ounce by the end of 2026, the bank said.\n\nHowever, if diversification demand accelerates further — particularly on concerns about fiscal risks in Western economies — volatility could remain elevated. That's especially true if the flows continue to be expressed through options.\n\nIn that case, near-term central-bank demand may be dampened even as prices rise more sharply.\n\nDavid Miller, the chief investment officer of $10 billion Catalyst Funds, echoed the longer-term case for official-sector demand earlier this month.\n\n\"From a mining perspective, there has been some selling by individuals cashing in their gold holdings at higher prices, but nothing on a scale that could offset the 1,000 metric tons of net buying by central banks,\" Miller wrote in a note last week.\n\nMiller, who manages a gold ETF, added that central banks are likely to continue buying gold, keeping demand ahead of supply, as mining output can't be ramped up quickly.\n\n\"It appears we're transitioning back into a longer-term rally, though one that is likely to be much choppier,\" he added.",

In its latest chapter, it's pixels.\n\nMore than 30 years after Woody worried about being replaced by Buzz Lightyear, the franchise is ready to take on a bigger threat: the screen.\n\nThe official trailer for \"Toy Story 5\" was released on Thursday and shows the toys vying for Bonnie's attention against a frog-themed tablet named Lilypad. Bonnie is the young girl to whom Andy gave his toys when he left for college at the end of \"Toy Story 3.\"\n\nIn the clip, Bonnie receives the device in a package and is almost instantly absorbed, scrolling and tapping with a glazed look as her analog toys watch from the sidelines.\n\nIt all builds to a face-off between Jessie the cowgirl doll and Lilypad. Jessie says, \"You're not even listening to me,\" only for the tablet to coolly reply, \"I'm always listening.\"\n\nJessie, voiced by Joan Cusack, has been in charge since Woody left at the end of \"Toy Story 4.\" Now, as Bonnie's attention drifts elsewhere, the gang brings their old — and now balding — leader back.\n\n\"I don't know, Jessie,\" Woody says in the trailer. \"Toys are for play, but tech is for everything.\"\n\nThe film is set to be released on June 19, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen returning to voice Woody and Buzz, respectively.\n\nThe storyline taps into a broader debate playing out in real life, as parents and experts wrestle with how screens are reshaping childhood.\n\nToo much screentime has been linked to delays in social skills development, as well as problems with attention and behavior. Those concerns have prompted some governments to move toward banning social media use for children under 16.\n\nThe last installment in the Pixar franchise, \"Toy Story 4,\" was released in 2019.

The goal is to reduce costs and focus on higher-performing markets.\n\nMany of the chain's current challenges trace back to 2014, when the private equity firm Golden Gate Capital acquired Red Lobster from Darden Restaurants (DRI) for $2.1 billion. To help finance the deal, the company sold its real estate properties for $1.5 billion in a sale-leaseback transaction.\n\nWhile the move provided short-term liquidity, it left the chain paying substantial rent, increasing operational costs. By 2023, annual lease obligations had climbed to about $190.5 million, roughly 10% of its revenue, with more than $64 million tied to underperforming locations, according to the bankruptcy filing.\n\nRed Lobster ended 2024 with approximately 528 locations. However, some leases bundle multiple restaurants, making it difficult to close weaker stores without affecting stronger ones.\n\n\"Much of the liquidity from the sale-leaseback went toward paying dividends to private equity investors rather than addressing systemic operational issues or adapting the menu and brand to shifting market demands,\" wrote University of Pennsylvania Professor of Operations, Information & Decisions Gad Allon on Substack. \"This misallocation of resources underscores the risks of prioritizing short-term gains over strategic reinvestment.\"\n\nSince emerging from bankruptcy, Red Lobster has revamped its menu and marketing to better align with shifting consumer preferences and evolving trends.",

    "fullText": "A possible first wave of an attack on Iran would focus on strategic missile sites and launchers, the most immediate threats to US forces and Israel, a former CENTCOM official told the Post.\n\nThe massive accumulation of US military assets in the Middle East is not merely a show of force but a signal that the United States has the capacity to dismantle the Iranian regime’s power structure in a matter of hours, according to Vice Admiral (Ret.) Bob Harward, former deputy commander of US Central Command (CENTCOM).\n\n“One thing he’s illustrated is that [President Donald] Trump does what he says,” Harward told The Jerusalem Post, citing the withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and the US’s stance that it will not tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran. “Now he’s positioned the assets for a military action,” Harward said.\n\n“If he cannot meet the objectives regarding the nuclear and ballistic missile program, he’s willing to go beyond mediation and act.”\n\nIf the order to strike is given, Harward, who served as deputy commander of CENTCOM until 2013, detailed a hierarchy of targets designed to neuter Iran’s offensive capabilities while sparing the general population. The priority, according to the former commander, would be “bottom-up.” The first wave would target strategic missile locations and launchers – the direct threats to US forces and Israel.\n\nThe second priority would be neutralizing the remnants of surrogates outside the country that pose a risk of retaliation against Israel.\n\nHowever, the most significant shift in strategy concerns the regime’s internal grip on power. Harward suggested that a campaign would target the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the instruments used to oppress the Iranian people, rather than the national infrastructure.\n\n“You’re not going to look at infrastructure,” Harward explained. “This is to provide the Iranian people a change in government, so I think those types of targets will not be hit. It will be focused only on the things that enable the regime and the IRGC to suppress the people.”\n\nPerhaps the most chilling warning for Tehran was Harward’s description of modern American warfare capabilities, which he noted are vastly superior to what was seen in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. “Because of what we’ve learned and what we’ve been able to develop technology-wise – be it command, control, and targeting – it allows your mass of strikes to be more effective,” Harward said.\n\n“Where previously you could do 40 or 50 strikes a day, we now have the ability to conduct hundreds of strikes a day. That in itself changes the equation completely for the regime.”\n\nHarward elaborated that the US now possesses the capability to decapitate the IRGC’s command structure with overwhelming speed. “If you’re targeting the IRGC and want to go after all their headquarters and facilities, you could probably do that in a matter of hours. That’s unprecedented.”\n\nHarward’s perspective is shaped not only by his military service but also by his personal history. His family lived in Iran from 1968 to 1979, and he was in the country as a senior at the US Naval Academy just weeks before the Shah fell.\n\nRecalling the 1979 revolution, Harward noted that the turning point came when the military shifted from supporting the Shah to supporting the people. He believes a similar dynamic is key to any future change in Tehran. “This is a regime that for 47 years has oppressed its people,” he said. “The bulk of them want change.”\n\nHe emphasized that any military action must be aligned with supporting the Iranian population, ensuring that the target list degrades the regime’s ability to communicate and suppress dissent without alienating the public.\n\n“I don’t think anyone really understands the scale or capacity we have because no one’s ever seen it before,” Harward said, adding a warning to other global powers. “If it does happen, this will be illuminating for everyone to understand where we have come in terms of size, scale, speed, and capacity – be it Russia or China.”",

    "fullText": "Verizon has been struggling to retain loyal customers following recent price hikes and increasing competition in the wireless industry. Amid those pressures, the company has made a major policy change that makes it harder for customers to cut ties and move to another carrier.\n\nLast month, Verizon received approval from the Federal Communications Commission to waive a rule requiring it to automatically unlock a phone it sells to a customer after 60 days, despite backlash from consumers and advocacy groups who labeled Verizon’s request as “anti-consumer behavior.”\n\nVerizon was first required to comply with the rule in 2008, after it acquired licenses to use 700 MHz spectrum. The requirement was reaffirmed when Verizon purchased TracFone in 2021. Verizon argued that the phone unlocking rule has contributed to “device fraud” and made phones less affordable for low-income consumers.\n\nThe FCC confirmed that Verizon saw a spike in fraud after the rule took effect, and its stolen handsets have even been resold on the dark web at premium prices in multiple countries.\n\n“By waiving a regulation that incentivized bad actors to target one particular carrier’s handsets for theft, we now have a uniform industry standard that can help stem the flow of handsets into the black market,” said FCC Chair Brendan Carr in a press release.\n\nShortly after receiving approval to have the rule waived, Verizon updated its device unlock policy for its prepaid brands on Jan. 20. Devices purchased from Total Wireless, Visible, StraightTalk and Tracfone are now only unlocked upon request after 365 days of paid and active service and if several conditions are met.\n\nMore recently, Verizon also tweaked its device unlock policy for postpaid phone customers, a change the company claims it implemented on Jan. 27, according to a recent report from Ars Technica.\n\nPostpaid phones purchased from Verizon will be automatically unlocked once paid in full, meaning customers won’t be able to switch to another carrier if they have a remaining balance.\n\nHowever, if a customer pays off the device online or in the My Verizon App, the unlocking process will be delayed by 35 days.\n\nThis delay also applies if a customer uses a nonsecure payment method such as a Verizon gift card, paper check or magnetic stripe swipe to purchase or pay off the device. For business customers, bill credits are also considered nonsecure payment methods. Verizon claims that this move will help prevent fraud.\n\nPreviously, the 35-day waiting period applied only to customers who used a Verizon gift card as a payment method.\n\nTo dodge this waiting period, customers must pay off the balance of the device with a secure payment such as a credit card with an EMV chip, cash or contactless payment, but it has to be at a Verizon store.\n\nIt is also important to note that customers should not encounter a waiting period to have their phone unlocked if they pay it off via automatic monthly payments on a device plan.\n\nEven though Verizon claims it updated its policy on Jan. 27, the change wasn’t live on its website until Feb. 11, according to Ars Technica. This means Verizon will apply the new rules to transactions that occurred before the policy change was posted on its website.\n\nThe report also states that the 35-day waiting period applies regardless of when the device was purchased.\n\nThe move from Verizon comes after it saw an influx of new wireless customers. During the fourth quarter of 2025, Verizon welcomed 616,000 new postpaid phone customers, according to its latest earnings report.\n\nDespite this success, the company saw its postpaid phone churn, the amount of postpaid phone customers who canceled their service, reach 0.95%, which is higher than the 0.88% churn it reported for the same quarter in 2024. The company’s operating income also declined by 32.6% year over year.\n\nDuring an earnings call last month, Verizon CEO Dan Schulman mainly attributed the elevated churn to “prior pricing actions as well as competition” and said there are four reasons why customers are leaving the company.\n\nT-Mobile drops 2 new phone plans to stop customers from fleeing\n\nVerizon CEO shifts gears after 2.25 million customers depart\n\nAT&T closes billion-dollar acquisition to win back customers\n\n“It’s price increases without corresponding value,” said Schulman. “That just irritates some customers, and we've seen the churn rise as a result of that, and we've stopped doing that, and we're going to start adding value to it.”\n\n“Second is friction in the process, whether it's onboarding, the billing,” he continued. “When they call our customer service, that needs to be flawless, and we need to reduce complexity, and we need to address that. We already have initiatives underway to address each and every one of those things. And then there's price perception and competitive intensity.”\n\nWhile many consumers have been switching to other traditional carriers, such as T-Mobile and AT&T, for lower-priced phone plans, they have also been joining smaller wireless carriers, such as mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs).\n\nCable companies such as Comcast and Spectrum have also been gaining new phone customers through their bundled phone, TV and internet offers.\n\nJeff Kagan, an industry analyst, said that the telecom industry is rapidly changing due to a “renewed focus and energy” at these companies.\n\n“New competitors, new technologies, and new marketing approaches will continue to reshape this industry,” said Kagan. “The question is what leadership in this sector will look like five or ten years from now.”\n\nAs more consumers explore nontraditional phone service options, a Market Force Information survey last year found that Verizon is failing to surpass smaller wireless carriers in consumer satisfaction.\n\nAbout 65% of U.S. consumers are enrolled in phone plans from Verizon, T-Mobile, or AT&T, and pay, on average, over $100 per month for service.\n\nVerizon customers spend an average of $157 per month on phone service, the highest among its top competitors.\n\nVerizon has a 40% overall brand performance score across key customer experience metrics.\n\nSmaller wireless carriers outperformed larger ones, with Consumer Cellular at 73% rating and Mint Mobile scoring 65.8%.\n\nIn consumer loyalty rankings, Verizon fell below the 25th percentile, ranking near the lower tier of providers. By contrast, smaller carriers including Consumer Cellular, Mint Mobile and Google Fi, ranked above the 75th percentile.\n\nIn a press release, David Murray, senior director of client strategy at Market Force Information, said that “superior customer experiences” are what more consumers nationwide are seeking from their wireless providers.\n\n\"While cost and coverage are always key factors, today's consumers are placing more importance on ease of service and overall satisfaction with their provider,” said Murray.  “The top performers are setting the bar in both customer experience and loyalty.\"",

Sears filed for bankruptcy in 2018 and then bought out of that in 2019.

    "fullText": "A grainy 8mm film allegedly hidden away by federal authorities for decades could blow the lid off the assassination of President John F. Kennedy — and prove there was a second shooter on the infamous grassy knoll, the National Examiner can reveal.\n\nDallas air-conditioning repairman Orville Nix shot the remarkable footage on that fateful day, Nov. 22, 1963, in Dealey Plaza. The film captures a startling image of a shadowy figure lurking behind a fence on the knoll — the very spot where many witnesses reported hearing gunfire, per New York Post.\n\nWhile the famous Zapruder film shows the instant JFK was struck in the head, Nix was positioned across the street, aiming his camera directly toward the grassy knoll. His footage includes a clear view of First Lady Jackie Kennedy climbing onto the back of the presidential limousine — with the fence in the background.\n\nThe original, first-generation film has not been seen since 1978, when it was sent to a Los Angeles company for analysis and was allegedly seized by federal authorities, who now claim they no longer possess it.\n\nNix died in 1972, but his granddaughter Linda Gayle Nix Jackson has filed court papers against the U.S. government seeking to recover the missing film. She claims it could be worth as much as $900 million because it may prove once and for all that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone in assassinating JFK. A judge has ruled her lawsuit may proceed. The government insists it doesn’t possess the original film.\n\nOver the past six decades, Nix’s footage has reportedly passed through the hands of the FBI, United Press International, Congress and the Aerospace Corporation — the Los Angeles firm that says it returned the film to the National Archives after completing its analysis.\n\nThe historical value of the footage could be incalculable. It may bolster the findings of a 1978 House Select Committee on Assassinations report, which concluded that JFK was “probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.”\n\n“Nix’s film is really the only one known to have captured the grassy knoll area of Dealey Plaza at the moment the assassination occurred,” says Scott Watnik, an attorney for Jackson.\n\nModern technology could dramatically enhance the footage’s clarity, adds Watnik: “We could certainly reveal details that were impossible to detect when the committee examined the film in 1978.”\n\nEx-Prince Andrew Was Reportedly Exhibiting ‘Arrogance, Not Panic’ During Arrest: 'He Was Furious'\n\nEx-Prince Andrew Scandal ‘Taking a Toll’ on King Charles: ‘His Health Is a Big Concern’ (Exclusive)\n\nQueen Elizabeth Hid an Alleged Family Secret Involving Princess Margaret and the Queen Mother\n\nThis story New Video of John F.

In a meandering speech in Georgia on Thursday, the draft-dodging president recounted trying to give himself the medal after visiting Iraq in his first term but was talked out of it by his advisers. “I’ve given out so many to guys that are seriously brave—I mean, they come in with—the arms are missing, the legs are missing, the stories are so unbelievable,“ Trump said. ”And I said: it’s a little stretch if I gave myself one of them.”",

    "fullText": "New Tottenham boss Igor Tudor's first game in charge is Sunday's north London derby - but will he make a dream start at home against Arsenal or have a nightmare?\n\n\"Tottenham's stadium has been an unhappy place all season,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton. \"Tudor's problem, if he doesn't get off to a fast start, is that there is going to be negativity around him too.\n\n\"Spurs are in a relegation fight and their fans will be asking why have we employed someone to keep us up who doesn't have a lot of knowledge of the Premier League?\"\n\nSutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.\n\nHis guest for week 27 is Embrace bassist Steve Firth, who is a fan of Leeds United, who are 15th in the Premier League table after gaining promotion last season.\n\nEmbrace are celebrating their 30th anniversary in 2026 and their new track, Road To Nowhere, is out now and their new album, Avalanche, out in June.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can pick your own below.\n\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\n\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\n\nFirth's favourite Leeds players are mostly from the 1990s, when he was an Elland Road regular, but more recently he was a big fan of midfielder Kalvin Phillips too.\n\n\"I always loved Gordon Strachan, Gary McAllister and David Batty - we had a superb midfield then,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Then we had Tony Yeboah up front for a couple of seasons, and he was amazing too.\n\n\"There were so many good players for Leeds back then, but I didn't get to see Eric Cantona play for us - that's the one thing I regret.\n\n\"In the past few years, Phillips really stood out before he went to Manchester City. He was a genuine superstar of the future when he was playing for us, so it is shame what has happened with him since.\n\n\"Now? The whole team has turned things around in the past few months because we were in serious trouble in November, but we have only lost a couple of games since then.\n\n\"I do think we're definitely safe now - we are going to do all right from now on and we will finish in mid-table.\n\n\"That is all we can really aspire to at the moment as a promoted team. You just need to hang in there as long as you can really and build up your squad slowly, without over-spending.\n\n\"We've started doing that already. We were very lucky to get Dominic Calvert-Lewin in for nothing, because he has been brilliant.\"\n\nChris Sutton and Steve Firth were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this week's Premier League scores'.\n\nI was at Elland Road when Aston Villa won there in November - Leeds were really good in the first half but faded, and two Morgan Rogers goals gave Villa the points.\n\nLeeds' form has picked up a lot since then, however, and they are on 30 points now.\n\nThat would have been enough to keep them up last season, when third-bottom Leicester went down with 25 points, but they have still got some work to do.\n\nVilla have slipped up a couple of times at home in the past few weeks, losing unexpectedly to Everton and Brentford, and they are probably looking at the table thinking they should be breathing down leaders Arsenal's neck.\n\nI can see Leeds giving them another good game, but I don't see Unai Emery's side dropping points this time. Villa will find a way.\n\nSteve's prediction: This is a tough game but we're on a good run of form and I think we'll get a draw. 1-1\n\nSteve on why he supports Leeds: I'm from Halifax and everyone there either supports Leeds, Huddersfield or Manchester United. I've been a Leeds fan since the 1970s but the time I watched them most was in the 1990s - that's when I'd go most weeks.\n\nSince then, of the guys I went with, one died and the other one moved away so I got out of the habit and I only get to the occasional game now. But my wife is a Mansfield fan, so I have to go and watch them sometimes. I was hoping they would get Leeds in the FA Cup fifth round - we would definitely have gone to that one - but they got Arsenal instead.\n\nI covered Brentford in the FA Cup tie at Macclesfield on Monday and they were completely underwhelming.\n\nI know they were on a plastic pitch but they couldn't really find their flow and needed an own goal to progress.\n\nStill, the Bees have been in much better form in the Premier League - in stark contrast to Brighton.\n\nFabian Hurzeler's side have won only one of their past 13 league games in a poor run going back to the start of December, and it is not impossible they could get dragged into the relegation scrap.\n\nI can see this one being close but Brentford will have Kevin Schade back from suspension, while Igor Thiago will also return after being rested against Macclesfield - and those two should make the difference.\n\nSteve's prediction: Brentford are too good for Brighton. My predictions are going to be very conservative by the way, there are no 5-0s! 2-1\n\nSo much for me thinking that Burnley might give their fans something to cheer about by going on a good FA Cup run.\n\nAfter their brilliant fightback to beat Crystal Palace in their last league game, the Clarets made changes against Mansfield and went out on their own patch to a League One side.\n\nI just can't see anything other than a home win for Chelsea here, even with their wobble last time at Stamford Bridge where Leeds fought back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 - Liam Rosenior's side won't let that happen again.\n\nSteve's prediction: Definitely a Chelsea win here. My wife was very happy when Mansfield beat Burnley last week. 2-0\n\nWest Ham are still in the bottom three but they have shown they are up for the fight in the past few weeks.\n\nYes, they conceded a late equaliser against Manchester United in their last league game, but they keep on picking up points and that must have given them belief they can stay up.\n\nBournemouth are on a good run now too, with three wins in their past four league games but, along with Brighton, they are the Premier League's draw specialists this season - both have had 10 so far.\n\nIt finished 2-2 when these two sides met on the south coast in November and I can see the points being shared this time too.\n\nSteve's prediction: I am going with Bournemouth to edge this. 1-2\n\nThis is the fourth meeting between these two clubs already this season, with another to come soon in the FA Cup fifth round - I bet they are sick of each other already.\n\nNewcastle have a long trip back from Azerbaijan to contend with before this game but at least they have put their Champions League tie with Qarabag to bed already and can focus fully on City rather than next week's second leg.\n\nThe Magpies still have an awful record at Etihad, however - they lost here in the Carabao Cup in January and have never managed a win in 20 visits in the Premier League.\n\nI don't think this will be easy for City, but I do think they will beat them, again, to move within two points of Arsenal.\n\nThe only thing I am not sure about is whether to captain Erling Haaland in my Fantasy team, because he has been out injured.\n\nSteve's prediction: I've always liked Newcastle but I think City are going to win the league so I am going to back them here. 2-0\n\nFair play to Wolves, because they have turned a bit of a corner under Rob Edwards.\n\nTheir results have still never looked like being enough to keep them up but they showed again against Arsenal that they are at least being competitive now.\n\nEven so, I can see this game being all about Jorgen Strand Larsen, following his £48m move from Wolves to Palace at the end of the January transfer window.\n\nPalace still need the points and I would not be surprised if he has a say in the outcome - let's go for him to score the winner.\n\nSteve's prediction: Wolves are down so I am giving Palace this one. 2-0\n\nWhen Vítor Pereira went in as Wolves manager in December 2024, he did brilliantly to keep them up - but he has essentially taken them down this season, picking up only two points from 10 games before he was sacked.\n\nNow he has arrived at Forest as their fourth manager of the season.\n\nI don't think his predecessor, Sean Dyche, deserved the sack. Based on the results in his 18 games in charge, Forest would be 12th in the table, but we are used to seeing managerial changes at the City Ground now.\n\nWe know Pereira will try to keep things tight, but Forest's biggest issue throughout this campaign has been scoring goals and I am not sure they will be able to get at Liverpool.\n\nArne Slot's side became the first team to win at the Stadium of Light when they edged out Sunderland in their last league game, and I can see a similar outcome here.\n\nSteve's prediction: Forest might get a new manager bounce but I still think Liverpool will win. As a Mansfield fan, my wife hates Forest so I am not allowed to like them either! It's the same with Chesterfield too. 0-2\n\nSunderland's form has dropped off a little bit in recent weeks but they have still had a phenomenal season and are probably safe already on 36 points - now they just have to see it through.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how Regis le Bris's side respond to their first home defeat of the season, but Fulham are hardly on a great run either with three straight league losses.\n\nMarco Silva's side beat the Black Cats at Craven Cottage in November, and will leapfrog them in the table if they win this time too - but I don't think that will happen.\n\nSteve's prediction: I wasn't sure about this one because they are both decent sides so I am going for a draw. 1-1\n\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium, 16:30\n\nFrom what I've read about new Tottenham manager Igor Tudor, he is a guy who goes in at clubs and, in the short term, gets a turn out of his team.\n\nSpurs really need that to happen now, because they desperately need a win or two to get out of reach of relegation.\n\nSo, this game is big for them for that reason, and also because they can put another dent in Arsenal's title hopes too.\n\nSpurs and their fans have not had a lot to shout about this season, but if they can get something here then this could be a defining moment in their campaign, and affect Arsenal as well. They would love that.\n\nIt was an incredible wobble by Mikel Arteta's team against Wolves, drawing 2-2 after being 2-0 up, and I certainly didn't see it coming.\n\nMaybe it is getting to be 'squeaky bum time' for them, but it didn't affect them when they went away to Leeds a couple of weeks ago and won convincingly.\n\nYou can imagine how Spurs will be champing at the bit, and I am expecting them to make a fast start and have a real go at them - but Arsenal have to deal with that, and find a way of bouncing back.\n\nI think the Gunners can do that, and their quality will make the difference in the end. I worry about Spurs in forward areas and it will be interesting to see how Tudor lines them up in defence too.\n\nUltimately, if Arsenal turn up and play how we know they can, then they will win - and I am expecting them to make a real statement.\n\nSteve's prediction: Two bottlers here! I'd like Arsenal to win the league, but I don't think they will. Man City are just used to doing it from here - they just get their heads down in the run-in, and they know what to do. 2-3\n\nManchester United lost at home to Everton in November despite the Toffees going down to 10 men in the 13th minute, when Idrissa Gueye was sent off for striking his team-mate Michael Keane.\n\nRuben Amorim's United just could not find a way of breaking Everton down that night, but there is a very different feel about them now Michael Carrick is in charge.\n\nThey needed a stoppage-time equaliser to get a point at West Ham last time out but they seem much more confident and have been playing well.\n\nThis will be a tough game for them but, as I've mentioned previously, Everton have picked up more points on the road this season than they have done at home.\n\nThat's another reason why I fancy United to get something here, and stop David Moyes doing the double over his former club.\n\nSteve's prediction: We were all enjoying United's mid-table mediocrity but they have started to win now. 1-2\n\nChris correctly picked the winner in 10 of the 15 fourth-round ties to have been played so far - Port Vale versus Swindon was postponed and takes place on 3 March.\n\nHe got the better of his guests, Looney Tunes stars Daffy Duck and Porky Pig - Daffy has nine correct predictions, while Porky has eight.\n\nAI did better with a score of 11, again by avoiding any surprise results, but it is the BBC readers who continue to lead the way, with a tally of 13.\n\nOverall, Chris has now correctly picked the winner in 31 of the 47 ties from round three onwards.\n\nHis guests are on 26, AI is on 34, but the BBC readers are in pole position with 36.\n\nThe shock of the round was Mansfield's win at Burnley which caught out Chris, AI, and most of you lot.\n\nDaffy and Porky did see it coming, however, and out of around 25,000 predictions, more than 3,000 of you also backed the Stags.\n\nChris got three correct results from the 10 midweek Premier League matches in week 26 [which took place from 10-12 February] with one exact score, for a total of 60 points.\n\nThat was enough to beat the BBC readers, who got three correct results with no exact scores, giving them 30 points.\n\nHe also got the better of his guest, golf star Ian Poulter, who got two correct results with no exact scores, for a tally of 20 points.\n\nBut the weekly win went to AI, which got four correct results with two exact scores, for a tally of 100 points.\n\nThere was one other Premier League game played this week - Arsenal's draw with Wolves on Wednesday, which was rearranged because the Gunners are in the Carabao Cup final on 22 March.\n\nEveryone went for an Arsenal victory, so no extra points were scored.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Outflows from midsize U.S. firms to China have dropped by approximately 20% since 2024, but there’s a price.",
    "fullText": "A new analysis from the JPMorgan Chase Institute reveals that while aggressive trade policies implemented in 2025 have successfully driven a significant wedge between midsize American businesses and Chinese suppliers, the decoupling has come with a staggering price tag for U.S. companies.\n\nThe report, titled “Tracking international payments: How are midsize firms reacting to tariffs?” paints a picture of a business sector that is bending but not breaking under historic pressure. According to JPMorgan banking data on financial outflows of firms with revenues between $10 million and $1 billion, the cost of importing goods has skyrocketed—and American companies are bearing the brunt.\n\nWhere are U.S. companies sourcing imports instead of China?\n\nHow much have tariff payments increased for midsize firms?\n\nWhat long-term risks do these trade policies pose?\n\nWhy are midsize firms particularly vulnerable to tariff impacts?\n\nWhile these companies scramble for alternative sources to Chinese manufacturing, they’re paying a big price on imports. Following the implementation of tariff rate increases and new universal tariffs in April 2025, monthly tariff payments by these midsize firms have tripled compared with early 2025 levels.\n\nIf the primary objective of the trade policy was to reduce American reliance on Chinese manufacturing, the banking giant’s data suggests the strategy is working. Outflows from midsize U.S. firms to China have dropped by approximately 20% since 2024.\n\nHowever, this retreat from China has not signaled a retreat from the global economy. Instead of reshoring operations entirely, American businesses appear to be engaging in a costly game of musical chairs.\n\nThe report finds that while payments to China fell, outflows to other regions—specifically Southeast Asia, Japan, and India—have accelerated. This evidence points to “import substitution,” where U.S. firms rush to find alternative suppliers in friendly nations to bypass the steepest levies placed on Beijing.\n\nThe JPMorgan researchers warn that while trade volumes have remained stable, the financial health of these companies may be at risk. Midsize firms are uniquely vulnerable; they are often too large to fly under the regulatory radar but “lack the scale to absorb sustained cost increases” compared with massive multinational corporations.\n\nThe burden of these new taxes has been particularly uneven. While the “universal tariffs” announced in April 2025 did capture new firms that previously paid no duties, the JPMorgan analysis found that the vast majority of the surge in government revenue came from firms that were already paying tariffs. Essentially, the policy has intensified the financial pressure on existing importers rather than spreading the cost widely across new players.",

    "description": "During a wide-ranging interview with Yahoo Finance, Eric Trump weighed in on bitcoin, crypto legislation, his personal debanking experience, and the latest digital asset project between the Trump Organization and his flagship crypto venture, World Liberty Financial.",
    "fullText": "Real estate and crypto entrepreneur Eric Trump said on Thursday that the crypto world is going to be the future of mainstream finance despite the rout of recent months.\n\nDuring a wide-ranging interview with Yahoo Finance, Trump weighed in on bitcoin, crypto legislation, his personal debanking experience, and the latest digital asset project between the Trump Organization and his flagship crypto venture, World Liberty Financial.\n\nWhat is World Liberty Financial's tokenization project about?\n\nWhat's causing delays in crypto legislation like Clarity Act?\n\nHow has the Trump family's crypto empire evolved?\n\nWhy is Eric Trump suing major banks?\n\n\"First of all, markets aren't always rational,\" Trump said while speaking from Palm Beach, Fla., pointing to bitcoin's performance over the past 10 years, when it was below $500 per coin.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) fell Thursday below $67,000, putting it on pace for its fifth straight week of decline. Its price has nearly halved since reaching an all-time high last October and is down 31% over the past year.\n\n\"If you don't have the backbone, the wherewithal to weather volatility, go invest in some boring bond that's going to yield you 4.5% and call it a day,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's comments came on the heels of World Liberty Financial pushing into a less volatile side of the crypto world: tokenization.\n\nIn partnership with crypto firm Securitize and a London stock exchange-listed subsidiary of major Saudi Arabian real estate developer DarGlobal, World Liberty is putting real estate assets linked to a Trump resort project in the Maldives, set for completion in 2030, on the blockchain.\n\nThe effort involves packaging revenue interests from loans tied to the real estate project so they can be sold as crypto securities to wealthy investors via crypto exchanges. Tokenization is the process of creating a crypto-world representation of an asset so that its likeness can be traded on crypto rails.\n\nThe tokenized real estate market stands at roughly $359 million, according to crypto data platform RWA.\n\nTokenization is \"going to change the way money flows around the world,\" Trump said, adding that he expects more of everything from debt and commodities to Hollywood film rights, fine art, and potentially even ownership in five-star restaurants to eventually go on blockchains.\n\n\"We're very excited to be on the forefront of that with real estate,\" he added.\n\nThe Trump family's crypto ventures have ballooned since Donald Trump embraced the crypto world while campaigning in 2024. His household's tied digital asset empire now sprawls into most corners of the crypto space.\n\nBut World Liberty has by far caught the most attention. In March 2025, the company launched USD1 (USD136148-USD), a US dollar-pegged stablecoin that is now the world's fifth largest after swelling to $5 billion in total market value.",

    "fullText": "The Trump administration said Thursday its campaign to end diversity programs in higher education has led dozens of universities to cut ties with an organization known as The PhD Project, which helps racial minorities earn doctorate degrees.\n\nThe PhD Project was a little-known nonprofit group until it caught the attention of conservative strategists last year and became the focus of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Education. The Republican administration says school diversity programs often exclude white and Asian American students.\n\nThe investigation, opened in March 2025, has resulted in 31 universities agreeing to end partnerships with the group, the department’s Office for Civil Rights said Thursday. Negotiations are continuing with 14 additional schools, it said.\n\nThe department said in its statement that The PhD Project “unlawfully limits eligibility based on the race of participants” and that institutions partnering with it violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in education programs and activities that receive federal money.\n\n“This is the Trump effect in action: institutions of higher education are agreeing to cut ties with discriminatory organizations, recommitting themselves to abiding by federal law, and restoring equality of opportunity on campuses across the nation,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said.\n\nMany of the schools promptly cut ties with The PhD Project after the investigation was opened, in order to avoid entanglements with the administration. It had undertaken the inquiries after warning schools they could lose federal money over “race-based preferences.”\n\nThe PhD Project is one of many nonprofits that helps underrepresented groups gain access to higher education.\n\n“The PhD Project was founded with the goal of providing more role models in the front of business classrooms and this remains our goal today,” the organization said in a statement Thursday. The website says it has “helped more than 1,500 members earn their doctoral degree.”\n\nThe group of 31 colleges listed by the department included major public research universities such as Arizona State, Ohio State and the University of Michigan, along with prestigious private schools like Yale, Duke and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nMIT, like many of the schools cited in the investigation, had paid The PhD Project “a nominal fee” to participate in the group's university fairs or conferences, allowing MIT to send representatives to answer questions about attending their school, spokesperson Kimberly Allen said.\n\nMIT informed the government in April 2025 it had ended its participation in such conferences and was notified months later that the Office for Civil Rights had found it in violation of Title VI. The school signed a “resolution agreement” with the department about a week ago to resolve the matter “but explicitly did not admit any liability, wrongdoing or violation of any law or regulation,” Allen said.\n\nThe University of North Dakota said it, too, promptly ended its membership with The PhD Project two weeks after the investigation was announced last year.\n\n“The University became a member of the PhD Project to have access to the PhD Project’s member directory and applicant database, to be able to recruit a larger pool of qualified applicants for faculty positions,” spokesperson David Dodds said in a statement.\n\nThe University of Utah said it had a table at annual conferences hosted by the nonprofit in the 2024-25 school year and two previous years. It cut ties with the project in October after settling with the department, university spokesperson Rebecca Walsh said.\n\nOut of 170 PhD students admitted to Utah's business school over the past 14 years, just two were involved through the PhD Project, Walsh said.\n\nThe Education Department said that all of the 31 universities have also agreed to review partnerships with other organizations “to identify any that violate Title VI by restricting participation based on race.”\n\nThe administration has targeted a wide range of practices that it has labeled as diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nThe Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "fullText": "A New Jersey family is raising awareness about the dangers of tick-borne illnesses, which are becoming more common as the climate in the Northeastern United States increasingly favors breeding and activity among the insects.\n\nA New Jersey man who contracted Lyme disease says he has been battling lingering neurological symptoms for years. In late January, Mike Gallagher's community hosted a benefit concert to help fund his continued treatments, the Asbury Park Press reported.\n\n\"It's all in his head, neck, and shoulders,\" Jen Gallagher, Mike's wife, told the outlet. \"He lost his use of his arms and shoulders, and the biggest love of his life was his guitar. He can't even hold his guitar anymore.\"\n\nThis type of story is likely to become more common as the planet continues to heat. Ticks thrive in warm, humid environments, and rising temperatures as well as shifting weather patterns in the Northeastern U.S. have enabled their populations to grow in recent years, according to experts at Boston University.\n\nReported cases of Lyme disease have increased accordingly, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has suggested. Ticks are also gradually expanding their range, leading to disease spread into locations previously undisturbed by the insects.\n\nLyme disease is a bacterial infection spread through bites from infected ticks. It can cause a characteristic \"bullseye\" rash along with symptoms including fever, headache, fatigue, and joint pain, according to the CDC.\n\nSometimes, and for reasons that doctors don't fully understand, Lyme symptoms can linger even after the infection has been treated with antibiotics, occasionally leading to a diagnosis of post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, or PTLDS.\n\nTick-borne illnesses as well as illnesses spread by other vectors — including mosquitoes, which can transmit malaria, dengue, West Nile virus, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika — are just a few of the many public health risks that humans are set to face as temperatures rise.\n\nRising global temperatures can also exacerbate the threat of heat-related deaths and catastrophic weather events. They may even decrease the effectiveness of vaccines, which are among our most potent tools for fighting disease.\n\nScientists are working on a vaccine that could help address Lyme disease spread — providing, of course, that weather shifts don't impact the vaccine's effectiveness and that equitable access is achieved.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nIn the meantime, prevention is going to be the best option for most.\n\nApart from working to mitigate rising temperatures through meaningful transitions to clean energy systems, experts recommend wearing long sleeves and pants to cover any exposed skin when spending time in the woods or woody areas. They also recommend using safe repellents, regularly checking skin for ticks, and removing any visible ticks with tweezers.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

The sale will feature new and used player-worn items – such as cleats, footballs, sweatshirts, T-shirts and more. Fans can begin lining up at 7 am.\n\n— Jonathan Jones (@jjones9) February 19, 2026\n\nMore: ESPN reveals stunning cost to fix glaring Ravens issue\n\nWith the glaring needs on the roster, general manager Brett Veach will have his work cut out.\n\nRunning back, offensive line, and pass rusher are the top three items on Reid's wishlist to be fixed, and the Chiefs, we think, as they always do, will find a way.\n\nWith Patrick Mahomes coming back from an ACL injury, it isn't known how healthy he'll be to begin the season. In fact, some think that around Week 6 could be a more realistic timeline.\n\nEither way, the Chiefs have to solve their roster issues, but in the meantime, they are giving their fans the chance to buy some pretty cool items that will no doubt have a lot of value attached to them.\n\nAnalyst offers Mike Evans reality that might soothe Buccaneers' worries\n\nESPN analyst thinks Dolphins' Tua Tagovailoa decision has already been made\n\nTexans' Dalton Schultz offers interesting C.J.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSpring Training might be here, but there’s still plenty of time to make a trade, and we should start to see some over the next few days to weeks prior to Opening Day.\n\nSports Illustrated’s Ryan Shea floated an intriguing trade that could help the Chicago Cubs and Seattle Mariners.\n\nIn the hypothetical trade, Seattle would acquire Gold Glove infielder Nico Hoerner, while Chicago would secure a package of young, controllable talent, which would improve its long-term core.\n\nCubs acquire: Emerson Hancock, Colt Emerson, Cole Young\n\nFrom Seattle’s standpoint, adding Hoerner would provide another really good offensive player at the top of their lineup and elite defense, which are two areas the Mariners have wanted to improve in recent years. For Chicago, the move would be to get off of Hoerner before likely losing him for nothing in free agency in 2027.\n\n“From Chicago’s perspective, moving Hoerner at peak value allows them to acquire controllable assets aligned with a longer-term competitive window. Emerson provides a premium middle infield prospect, Hancock adds a near-MLB-ready starting pitcher, and Young offers a high upside infielder with strong contact skills,” he wrote.\n\nHancock could slot into the rotation in the short term, while Emerson and Young would give the Cubs two promising infield building blocks as they reshape their farm system. However, with Dansby Swanson and Alex Bregman in the infield, the Cubs have enough infielders, so that’s something to consider.\n\nWhether Chicago will move on from Hoerner remains uncertain, but the noise is there and it seems like it’ll happen sometime in the near future.\n\nNew York Yankees trade proposal moves Cam Schlittler, George Lombard Jr, and Spencer Jones for generational award winner\n\nNew York Yankees fans will love Aaron Judge’s slight shot at Brian Cashman\n\nNew York Yankees urged to pair Aaron Judge with Bryce Harper for World Baseball Classic reason\n\nNew York Yankees get excellent injury news on Giancarlo Stanton as Spring Training gets underway\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies almost got bailed out of Nick Castellanos situation by historic team in American League\n\nNew York Yankees almost made a $20 million mistake but decided to sign Paul Goldschmidt instead",

    "fullText": "Sean Strickland has again made the rounds on social media for all the wrong reasons, and UFC Hall of Famer Amanda Nunes has taken notice.\n\nStrickland, a former UFC middleweight champion, made misogynistic comments on women's MMA when asked about his thoughts on Ronda Rousey vs. Gina Carano at Wednesday's UFC Fight Night 267 media day. Strickland said \"nobody gives a f*ck\" about women's sports, claimed \"the softest\" male could beat up Nunes, a former two-division UFC champion who's considered the greatest female fighter of all time. Strickland went on to state women are \"too empowered,\" and should focus on \"making food and cleaning the house.\"\n\nWell, fast-forward a day later, and Nunes has issued a response to Strickland's controversial comments.\n\n\"We do everything he said, and to top it all off, lol, we’re fighters too. #girlpower don’t cry,\" Nunes wrote on Instagram.\n\nThis isn't the first time Strickland has been the subject of controversy. He's long been public about his bigoted and racist views.\n\nStrickland returns to the cage this Saturday in the main event of UFC Fight Night 267 in Houston, Texas. He takes on fellow top contender Anthony Hernandez in a five-round bout. Ahead of the fight, Strickland posted a meme of himself with an ICE uniform and Hernandez, who's of Mexican descent, with a traditional Mexican hat and poncho.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Amanda Nunes responds to Sean Strickland's comments: 'Don't cry'",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlysa Liu's performance at the 2026 Winter Olympics was historic.\n\nThe 20-year-old, who came into Milan as the reigning 2025 world champion, didn't just help secure a gold medal for the United States in the team figure skating event. She also won the women's singles, becoming Team USA's first Olympic champion in the event in decades.\n\nLiu made a figure skating comeback to reach the pinnacle of the Winter Olympics. It paid off, as she joined an exclusive club of American women who have won an Olympic gold medal in the figure skating singles event.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the eight figure skaters Liu has joined.\n\nMORE 2026 OLYMPICS: Live medal tracker | Viewer's guide | Day-by-day schedule\n\nThere have now been eight women to win a gold medal for Team USA in singles figure skating.\n\nRunner-up: Carol Heiss (United States)\n\nThe first American woman to become a figure skating champion was Tenley Albright, who won the 1956 event in Cortina d'Ampezzo. Prior to then, Albright had already been a one-time Olympic silver medalist (1952) and two-time World Champion (1953, 1955) in the event.\n\nA native of Newton, Massachusetts, Albright would retire from competitive skating after 1956. She became the chief physician for the US Winter Olympics team in 1976 and the vice president of the U.S. Olympic Committee in 1982. Albright was also inducted into the International Women's Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nNow 90 years old, she was a pioneer in Olympic figure skating for American women.\n\nRunner-up: Sjoukje Dijkstra (Netherlands)\n\nAfter finishing as the runner-up to her fellow American in the 1956 Winter Olympics, Carol Heiss broke through with a gold medal in 1960, becoming the champion at the Squaw Valley Games in California.\n\nHeiss bested Dutch skater Sjoukje Dijkstra for gold that year. Heiss, who grew up in Queens, New York, was also a five-time figure skating World Champion. She retired after winning the 1960 World Championship.\n\nHeiss was also the first female skater to land a double axel jump. She was later inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame and the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame.\n\nMORE: How Alysa Liu dropped an \"F-bomb\" after her free skate at 2026 Winter Olympics\n\nRunner-up: Gabriele Seyfert (Germany)\n\nIn 1968, the U.S. had its third gold medalist in the women's figure skating singles event in the past four Winter Olympics. Peggy Fleming was the champion, and she ended up being the lone American gold medalist at the entire 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France.\n\nFleming grew up in California and went on to win three World Championships in addition to her Olympic gold medal.\n\nLater in life, Fleming became a vocal breast cancer activist after being diagnosed in 1998 and undergoing successful surgery. She appeared in the 2007 movie Blades of Glory, and now 77 years old, Fleming has also been a longtime television commentator in figure skating.\n\nRunner-up: Dianne de Leeuw (Netherlands)\n\nThe U.S. had another gold medalist by 1976, when Dorothy Hamill, who was born in Chicago but raised in Connecticut, won the event in Innsbruck, Austria.\n\nHammill was the last single skater to win the Olympics without a triple jump. Also in 1976, she was the women's singles World Champion.\n\nIn the years after her Olympic success, Hammill continued to skate professionally, from being an Ice Capades headliner from 1977 to 1984 to skating for \"Broadway on Ice.\" She's also made appearances on \"Dancing With The Stars\" and the Foot Network Show \"Chopped,\" and Hammill has written two autobiographies. Hammill is now 69 years old.\n\nMORE: What is a quadruple axel?\n\nThe U.S. went through a stretch without any gold medalists in women's figure skating, but Kristi Yamaguchi was the one who broke the cold spell in 1992. She also became the first Asian-American to win a gold medal in a Winter Olympics event, doing so in the Albertville Games in France.\n\nYamaguchi beat out Japan's Midori Ito for gold. In her career, she also was a two-time World Champion (1991, 1992) and a two-time national champion in pairs with Rudy Galindo. She retired from competition in 1992, then went on to perform in shows professionally, including winning the World Professional Figure Skating Championships four times.\n\nA 2005 U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame induction, Yamaguchi later became an author, 2008 member of \"Dancing With The Stars,\" and has made appearances in television skating special like \"Aladdin on Ice.\"\n\nRunner-up: Michelle Kwan (United States)\n\nThe United States had the gold and silver medalists in the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics in Japan. While Michelle Kwan finished as the runner-up, Tara Lipinski took gold.\n\nLipinski also was the 1997 U.S. and world champion, and she was the first woman to complete a triple loop–triple loop combination in a competition. For years, it was Lipinski who held the mark as the youngest single skater to win the U.S. Nationals, the Olympics, and the world championships.\n\nAfter retiring in 1998, Lipinski spent time performing in live shows, but she can now be heard as one of NBC's primary figure skating announcers — including at the 2026 Winter Olympics. She has held her position with the network since 2014.\n\nMORE: How does figure skating scoring work?\n\nRunner-up: Irina Slutskaya (Russia)\n\nOnce again, Michelle Kwan earned a medal for the U.S. in 2002, but it was Sarah Hughes who finished at the top of the figure skating singles leaderboard to win gold.\n\nHughes, who is from New York, went from winning bronze at the 2000 World Championships to Olympic gold, becoming the United States' seventh-ever gold medalist in women's singles figure skating. Her victory was considered a huge upset, as she was the youngest skater in the competition. The runner-up, Russia's Irina Slutskaya, and the bronze medalist, Kwan, were the favorites.\n\nHughes became the first woman in Olympic history to land two triple jump–triple jump combinations in a free skate, securing gold. She was later inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\nFor many years, Hughes, now 40 years old, was the United States' last female Olympic figure skating champion.\n\nRunner-up: Kaori Sakamoto, Japan\n\nIt took 24 years since the last American Olympic champion in the event, but Alysa Liu broke through in the 2026 Winter Olympics to finally secure more gold for the U.S. After retiring from figure skating at age 16, then deciding to re-enter the sport, Liu put up a dominant performance in the Milan Games — adding a second gold medal to her collection after also helping win the team event.\n\nLiu, who was also the 2025 World Champion and two-time U.S. champion, had once been the youngest-ever U.S. women's national champion at age 13. She was the first woman to complete both a quadruple jump and triple axel in the same program.\n\nWith her gold in Milan, Liu broke a drought for Team USA in the women's figure skating singles event.\n\nThe unique piercing on Alysa Liu's teeth\n\nWhy Alysa Liu's hair is dyed in 'halo' stripes\n\nThe meaning behind Alysa Liu's free skate song\n\nLast time American woman won figure skating gold\n\n'Alt, Gay and from New Jersey': Meet USA's figure skating stars",

As long as the Mariners stay healthy on the mound, they’ll be one of the better teams in baseball.\n\nOffensively speaking, while the Mariners aren’t in a bad spot on that side of the baseball, they could certainly use more, just as every contender. Sports Illustrated’s Ryan Shea believes a way to improve their offense would be in a trade with the Chicago Cubs for a respected infielder.\n\nCubs get: Emerson Hancock, Colt Emerson, Cole Young\n\n“The Mariners would benefit immediately from this trade, as Hoerner would improve their contact rate, infield defense, and baserunning efficiency while stabilizing the top of their lineup. He would likely slot into the No. 2 spot, giving Seattle a dependable table-setter ahead of its power hitters, and his team-friendly contract through 2026 makes him more than just a short-term rental,” he wrote.\n\nHoerner’s elite contact skills, defensive versatility, and other little things he does would only make Seattle better as it searches to get to the top of the baseball world.\n\nThis is the type of trade that would be tough to make, though, as giving up on Hancock, Emerson, and Young certainly comes with risk.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies had a decent offseason, but it still feels like more needs to be done.\n\nSearching for ways to add speed and athleticism to a power-heavy roster, it’s possible that Justin Crawford will be that guy. However, Sports Illustrated’s Ryan Shea believes a trade for Boston Red Sox outfielder Jarren Duran could make sense, and it wouldn’t require the Phillies to give up a whole lot.\n\nRed Sox get: Alec Bohm, Jean Cabrera, Brandon Marsh\n\n“The Philadelphia Phillies would be interested in a trade for Jarren Duran because he addresses several roster needs at once. Philadelphia’s lineup has traditionally leaned heavily on power, but it has lacked consistent speed and top-of-the-order athleticism.\n\n“Duran brings both. His ability to steal 20+ bases, score 85–90 runs, and pressure defenses with his speed would diversify an offense that can sometimes become station-to-station. Adding him would also improve outfield range and defensive flexibility, something that becomes especially important in October,” he wrote.\n\nWhile the Phillies have one of the most dangerous lineups in baseball, their offensive approach has also led to a lot of problems due to the lack of speed and inability to put the ball in play. Duran has struck out 160-plus times in each of the last two seasons, so he doesn’t fix that issue.\n\nHowever, Duran’s speed in the lineup could create more run opportunities for Philadelphia’s lineup.\n\nThe Phillies would also be able to get off Bohm.\n\nNew York Yankees trade proposal moves Cam Schlittler, George Lombard Jr, and Spencer Jones for generational award winner\n\nNew York Yankees fans will love Aaron Judge’s slight shot at Brian Cashman\n\nNew York Yankees urged to pair Aaron Judge with Bryce Harper for World Baseball Classic reason\n\nNew York Yankees get excellent injury news on Giancarlo Stanton as Spring Training gets underway\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies almost got bailed out of Nick Castellanos situation by historic team in American League\n\nNew York Yankees almost made a $20 million mistake but decided to sign Paul Goldschmidt instead",

But without success.\n\nOdair made CAP more offensive by swapping Chiquetti for Portilla.\n\nThe change had an effect, as Furacão came back strong after the break.\n\nThere was plenty of effort. But a lack of inspiration.\n\nCorinthians had more space for counterattacks.\n\nAnd couldn't find a good opportunity.\n\nThey won thanks to the only accurate shot they managed.\n\nFuracão learned a lesson in precision, as they had only two good chances during the entire second half.\n\nAthletico remains with six points. And now, they are seventh.\n\nMeanwhile, Corinthians reached the same points. And took the sixth place;\n\nBoth will play again in the Brasileirão next Wednesday (25).\n\nCAP will visit Red Bull Bragantino at Cícero de Souza Marques.\n\nMeanwhile, Timão will face Cruzeiro at Mineirão.\n\nBefore that, however, both will have decisive matches in their respective State Championships on Sunday (22).\n\nFuracão will face Londrina at the Arena after a 2-2 draw in the first leg of the Paranaense semifinals.\n\nMeanwhile, the Alvinegro will visit Portuguesa in the quarterfinals of the Paulistão.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

While spending time in the humid Caribbean during the winter, he lost 10 pounds and is back at the 204-pound build that he usually plays at.\n\nAlthough he wasn't playing at full strength, Hernandez was able to kick his talents into full gear in the postseason. On the way to the Dodgers' second straight World Series, he hit five home runs and 13 RBI in 17 games.\n\nIn his second season of a three-year, $66 million contract, Hernandez is back with a vengeance as Los Angeles begins their reign for a third straight World Series title.\n\nFreddie Freeman addresses future with Dodgers as he enters age-36 season\n\nFreddie Freeman faces uncertain Dodgers future thanks to Shohei Ohtani\n\nDodgers are changing Mookie Betts' spot in potent new-look lineup\n\nWalker Buehler reflects on time with Dodgers after signing with Padres",

    "fullText": "Tuesday was a spectacular day of hockey in the Olympic men’s hockey tournament at the 2026 Olympic Winter Games in Milan/Cortina d’Ampezzo. Three of the four games went to overtime before being decided.\n\nThe hockey was unbelievable, with Canada, the United States, Slovakia and Finland advancing to play in the semifinals on Friday.\n\nHowever, we also saw a historical refereeing blunder that will go into the history books. On a third period goal between the Czechia and Canada with seven minutes and 42 seconds left, the officials completely missed the fact that the Czech Republic had too many men on the ice.\n\nThe goal was scored by Ondrej Palat of the New York Islanders. At the time, the Czechs went up 3-2. The six Czech players on the ice could be seen celebrating the goal. Further footage actually had eight players on the ice!\n\nSome can understand the officials missing the too many men on the ice call. What is even more mind-boggling is the fact the too many men on the ice call was missed by the Canadian players and coaching staff.\n\nThis was a serious lack of engagement from a Canadian perspective with the game itself. Canadian defenseman Drew Doughty had the following comments according to Frank Servalli of Victory+:\n\n“Not a single player, coach knew until after the game. Nobody. Yeah, we talked about it. We’re like, ‘How did that get missed?’ But I mean, we all missed it. It makes sense that the refs could miss it too. S*** happens.”\n\nThe International Ice Hockey Federation and International Olympic Committee would have had a massive problem on their fans if Canada did not come back to win. Nick Suzuki scored the game-tying goal and Mitch Marner had the game-winning goal.\n\nThe answer is yes. They should be fined an undisclosed sum and not be allowed to officiate another game for the rest of the tournament. The officials responsible for the missed call were referees Mikael Holm of Sweden, and Chris Rooney of the United States, and linesmen David Brisebois of Canada and Jonny Murphy of the United States.\n\nThe IIHF and IOC blamed “human error,” but this is one of the calls that should always be made, especially with eight Czech players on the ice!\n\nOLYMPICS: USA figure skater Isabeau Levito gushes over Olympic Village\n\nNFL: Tyreek Hill makes hilarious first move after Dolphins release\n\nCBB: 2026 college basketball rankings, updated AP Top 25 after Week 15\n\nMLB: Tigers infielder from Taiwan apologizes to Koreans after trash talk goes viral\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: College Hall of Famer, father of Chicago Bulls coach, dies\n\nVIRAL: Chloe Kim ‘obsessed’ with $100k gift from NFL star Myles Garrett after Olympics\n\nThe post Officials make massive mistake in men’s quarterfinal game in Olympic hockey tournament appeared first on The Big Lead.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMany Boston Red Sox fans would say this offseason has been decent, but not good enough. Had the Red Sox re-signed Alex Bregman, they’d be in as good of a spot as any team in the American League, but that didn’t happen.\n\nThe Red Sox need to improve at the hot corner unless they really have that much trust in Caleb Durbin, and a trade pitch from Sports Illustrated’s Ryan Shea would do just that.\n\nRed Sox acquire: Alec Bohm, Jean Cabrera, Brandon Marsh\n\n“The Boston Red Sox would be interested in this deal because it allows them to address multiple roster needs while redistributing value from one player into three assets. Trading Jarren Duran would be difficult given his power-speed profile and team control, but if Boston believes its outfield depth can absorb the loss, this type of package strengthens other areas of the roster,” he wrote.\n\nDuran has been someone the Red Sox can rely on at times in his career, but he also struggled a good bit in 2025. Factor that in with the talent the Red Sox have in the outfield, and it isn’t crazy to suggest that trading the left-handed hitter makes sense.\n\nRegarding Bohm, he’s not great, but he’d give the Red Sox help at third base.

    "fullText": "Happy Thursday, Dodgers fans. Cactus League play is just around the corner for the Boys in Blue.\n\nAs we await the joy of getting to see World Series MVP Yoshinobu Yamamoto return to the mound on Saturday, here are some of the top headlines from around Major League Baseball.\n\nThe reigning back-to-back National League manager of the year was rewarded by the team on Thursday.\n\nThe Milwaukee Brewers gave Pat Murphy a three-year extension, ESPN reports.\n\nIn addition to the three years — 2026 through 2028 — the deal also includes a club option for 2029, Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic reports.\n\nThe trial of Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz, who are accused of tipping pitches to bettors in exchange for kickbacks, is likely to move to the fall, Zack Meisel of The Athletic reports.\n\nBoth have pleaded not guilty and are free on bail, though they are on the MLB’s restricted list.\n\nThey were scheduled to have their trial begin in May, though Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto “suggested she’ll ultimately shift the date to the fall,” Meisel wrote.\n\nThose involved were ordered to submit their preferred new trial date by Monday.\n\nIf October is indeed the new trial date, it will be interesting to see if the legal proceedings overlap with the World Series.\n\nInfielder Jazz Chisholm Jr. has made public his intentions to join Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani in an exclusive club that was empty until last season and now only includes the Japanese two-way player.\n\nChisholm told Chris Kirschner of The Athletic that he wants to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in a season, which was done for the first time in history by Ohtani just last year.\n\n“Reminded that 50-50 has been accomplished just once in MLB history, he shrugged,” Kirschner wrote. “’You’re looking at the second one,’ Chisholm said.”\n\nThe quest may seem nearly impossible, but Yankees teammate Aaron Judge expressed confidence to Kirschner.\n\n“He really can accomplish anything,” Judge said.",

    "fullText": "Sean Strickland has established himself as a man who demands media attention each time he speaks, though often not for the right reasons.\n\nThe UFC's move to Paramount has added benefits for fighters and fans alike, with a value boost in athlete bonuses for good performances, while supporters can tune in for $8.99 per month, a portion of the previous cost. But less than two months into their deal, Paramount is facing backlash after Strickland presented one of his infamous tirades during fight week.\n\nThe former UFC middleweight champion is in contention to compete for another title should he win his next outing, but that hasn't stopped him from being his old self. Strickland only had the center stage for a couple of minutes before discrediting Paramount.\n\n\"Yeah, no, f*** Paramount, man,\" Strickland said in protest against the new home of the UFC. \"It's real quiet today. I like it, man. You've got to like lose fights more often. It's going back to the Apex here with you guys. It's real quiet. No one's here. Is that like a bad sign for the MMA world or is it just this card?\"\n\nContinuing his attack on Paramount, Strickland blamed them for ruining a childhood passion of his.\n\n\"Paramount's cool,\" Strickland continued. \"I mean, they f***ing ruined Halo, but other than that, you know. They made it gay. Other than f***ing ruining like a childhood memory and legend to me, I mean, Paramount's cool.\"\n\n\"We don't make more money, but you know.\"\n\nAs the mixed martial arts world has become accustomed to, Sean Strickland is never too far away from damaging his image with wild remarks.\n\nHis appearance at UFC Houston media day had several controversial moments, but arguably none worse than the comments about Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny, who was honored with the Super Bowl LX halftime show headlining spot.\n\n\"I mean, look at the NFL, dude,\" Strickland said. \"You had that, I don't even want to say the fa**ots name because it's just like, what?... The Puerto Rican, right? Yeah, that f***ing fa**ot.\"\n\n\"Like, dude, it is so crazy that this is America now. Like, back in the day, dude, the NFL was like, the NFL was the f***ing standard of being a f***ing man. And now every f***ing year, the NFL, I think they all get together around a table and say, 'You know what, guys? How do we f***ing ruin this sport? How do we gay it up? How do we f***ing ruin it?' Well, I'll tell you what. Why don't we bring a gay foreigner who doesn't speak f***ing English and have him perform it?\"\n\n\"Like, get the f***. And then you have like, yeah, dude. It's like, the NFL is f***ing pathetic these days. So, even like the NFL players probably f***ing hate it. No, NFL's gay. I think we'd all agree that the NFL got real gay lately...\"\n\nThe aftermath of Sean Strickland's words has not been pretty. Not only have fans demanded that the UFC remove Strickland from any media obligations, while others are calling for his contract to be terminated, but the Paramount network has also been pushed to answer some uncomfortable questions.\n\nAccording to reports, many fans and media outlets have begun pressuring Paramount to respond to Strickland's vulgar comments. Homophobia and sexism persist anytime the UFC fighter is placed in front of a camera.\n\nThe public outrage may be justified, but Dana White will always promote free speech among those working in any of his business ventures. White's willingness to accept any comment is considered positive by some, but concerns are beginning to plague him and Paramount for allowing sensitive topics to be ridiculed.\n\n🚨 Paramount are now facing pressure from the media to address Sean Strickland publicly calling Bad Bunny a “f****t” and making sexist comments\n\nStrickland’s comments are now receiving coverage from @Variety who have contacted Paramount reps for comment, to no response yet pic.twitter.com/QMjLl0eXvY\n\n— ACD MMA (@acdmma_) February 19, 2026",

    "fullText": "Freddie Freeman said wants to play baseball for four more seasons before retiring, and he wants to spend those final years with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Freeman will be 40 years old in four seasons.\n\nThe Dodgers are currently in spring training and will have its first game against the Los Angeles Angels on Saturday at Camelback Ranch. Freeman, who has two years remaining on the six-year, $162 million contract he signed with the Dodgers in 2022, spoke to reporters about his retirement plans on Thursday.\n\nFreeman said he loves Los Angeles and wants to finish his career there. In order to play until he is 40, he will need to sign another contract. Although he hopes to re-sign with the Dodgers, Freeman said he will not ask for a new contract but will return if the franchise wants him.\n\n“It’s out of my control. I’m not worried about another contract, I’m not going to bring it up, not going to talk about it,” Freeman told reporters. “I’ve got two years left. I’m just an employee. I just do my job, and if they want me back, they want me back. But I think Andrew (Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman) and everyone knows I love being here.”\n\nFreddie Freeman says he wants to finish his career with the Dodgers. That would require a new contract at some point:\n\n\"I love being here. I'm from Southern California. I've had a great time with the fans I've got two years left, but Andrew and everyone knows I love being here.\" pic.twitter.com/wFUnlxyq3o\n\n— Doug McKain (@DMAC_LA) February 19, 2026\n\nFreeman has already accomplish a lot throughout his 16-season career in MLB. He has won three World Series championships, including back-to-back titles with the Dodgers in 2024 and 2025. In the 2024 World Series, he was named the World Series Most Valuable Player.\n\nAs an individual, Freeman is a nine-time NL All-Star, three-time NL Silver Slugger and was the 2020 NL Most Valuable Player while playing for the Atlanta Braves.\n\nFreeman said he would like to reach 3,000 career hits before retiring. He currently has 2,179 career hits, which is the most for any active MLB player. If he is able to hit the 3,000-hit mark, he will join an exclusive group of 33 former players who have recorded at least 3,000 hits in MLB history.\n\nThe most recent addition to the 3,000-hits club was Detroit Tigers first baseman Miguel Cabrera in April 2022. Cabrera retired from MLB in 2023.\n\nThe post Freddie Freeman Says He Wants to Finish His Career With the Dodgers appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "fullText": "Walmart's former side hustle is getting serious.\n\nThe retail giant reported that 2025 was its first full year of profitability in its e-commerce operations, which started — as most ventures do — needing time and money to get rolling.\n\n\"We've far surpassed the breakeven level,\" CFO John David Rainey said of the e-commerce business in the company's fourth quarter earnings call Thursday. \"The momentum is only upward from here.\"\n\nThe bet is paying off thanks in large part to the addition of higher-income shoppers, who Walmart said are attracted to its combination of low prices and increasing convenience.\n\n\"The majority of our share gains came from households making more than $100,000,\" CEO John Furner said on the earnings call.\n\nThe company said high-earning households have responded favorably to Walmart's online and in-app offerings, from ordering their weekly groceries to picking out stylish new outfits, as has been the case for several quarters now.\n\nFor the fiscal year, Walmart's overall sales grew 4.7% to $713.2 billion, with e-commerce increasing by nearly 25% to top $150 billion.\n\nDespite Walmart's growth, e-commerce giant Amazon dethroned it as the world's largest company by revenue last year with $716.9 billion in revenue. The stock dipped immediately after the earnings report but recovered during trading on Thursday.\n\nBut Walmart's progress in e-commerce could give Amazon a run for its money, thanks to its physical proximity to 95% of US households.\n\n\"Stores are a huge part of the solution to deliver the customer experiences that the customers are looking for,\" CEO John Furner said on the call. \"Having the US with 5,200 locations between Walmart and Sam's, where inventory is forward-deployed, is really helpful.\"\n\nAmazon, for its part, is working hard to counter Walmart's dominant physical presence, which so far has given it an edge in delivering items like groceries and everyday essentials in an hour or less.\n\nIt's not just fresh food delivery that's helping Walmart reach new shoppers. Rainey said shoppers are using some of the savings from groceries to try new items from other categories.\n\n\"It's not just convenience,\" Rainey said. \"I'd argue fashion is not really a convenience item. It shows that our broader assortment is appealing to a much larger customer base.\"\n\nFashion not only led sales growth in general merchandise in the US, Rainey said, but on-trend styles are also helping draw in more of these high-income households, who wind up sticking around.\n\n\"They're coming to Walmart, in many cases, some of them for the first time, and they're enjoying an experience that makes them want to come back these platforms,\" he said.\n\nGlobalData retail analyst Neil Saunders said his firm's data also shows wealthy households increasingly choosing Walmart for more than groceries, thanks to its expanded assortment and in-store experiences.\n\nIt's still too soon to see the impact of Walmart's recent AI partnerships, but Furner says the early results promise to turbocharge sales online and in-app. He said the company's in-house shopping assistant bot, Sparky, has led to 35% larger transaction totals.\n\n\"Roughly half of our app users have used Sparky, and when they use Sparky, it drives them to build bigger baskets,\" US segment CEO David Guggina said.\n\nWalmart still has a long road ahead to catch Amazon's online sales, but the past year has shown that it now has a powerful engine to get there.",

    "title": "Netflix's co-CEO says Trump has one big question about the Warner Bros. sale",
    "description": "Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos says President Donald Trump has spoken about wanting to bring jobs back to Hollywood after years of lower production.",
    "fullText": "Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos says President Donald Trump is all business as the Department of Justice weighs the streaming giant's potential acquisition of Warner Bros.\n\n\"The only thing we talk about is how to keep jobs in America, how to keep the production industry healthy,\" Sarandos said of his talks with Trump during an appearance on Puck's \"The Town\" podcast.\n\nTrump \"wants to know what happened in California,\" Sarandos said in the podcast episode, referencing the state's film and TV production decline.\n\nHollywood has increasingly gone outside Los Angeles to make movies and shows in recent years, lured by tax credits in places ranging from Atlanta to the United Kingdom.\n\nOn-location shooting days for movies and TV shows in the LA area fell 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to a study from FilmLA Research published in mid-January. This production drop has hurt LA's creative community.\n\nTrump previously floated the idea of imposing tariffs on movies and shows made outside the US, though it's unclear how an import tax could apply to creative services.\n\nNetflix has been on a charm campaign to convince the president and Hollywood that it would be a better buyer of Warner Bros. than rival bidder Paramount Skydance.\n\nA key part of Netflix's pitch is that it would cut fewer jobs than Paramount. Paramount has said it's planning to create $6 billion in so-called synergies, which would likely include layoffs, while Netflix has told investors it's aiming for $2 billion to $3 billion in cost cuts, in part by saving money on licensing programming.\n\nWBD's board of directors seems sympathetic to Netflix's argument. The board warned shareholders that if it accepted Paramount's offer, there could be an exodus of employees seeking to avoid layoffs.\n\nAntitrust analysis often focuses on how strong a company is relative to its competitors and how the market power it could wield over consumers. Regulators also look at how a merger or acquisition would impact the production side, which in this case would be how many studios are competing to buy new movies or shows.\n\nParamount has argued that Netflix, the largest paid streaming service with over 325 million subscribers, would become too powerful if it bought the Warner Bros. studio and HBO assets. Netflix has downplayed those concerns, saying that it also competes against YouTube and traditional TV for attention.\n\nTrump said in December that Netflix had a \"very big market share\" so buying Warner Bros. \"could be a problem.\" However, the president said in early February that he had decided he \"shouldn't be involved\" and would defer to his Department of Justice.\n\n\"We do not discuss private conversations that may or may not have happened, but President Trump has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder,\" a White House official told Business Insider.\n\nNetflix's co-CEO said Trump hadn't asked him for political concessions relating to the Warner Bros deal.\n\n\"We're not talking about doing anybody any favors or anything else,\" Sarandos said.\n\nSarandos has long donated to Democrats, and Netflix is often seen by Republicans as a left-leaning company, as evidenced by the grilling Sarandos got during his visit to Capitol Hill in early February.\n\nNotably, Paramount is run by David Ellison and is financially backed by his father, Larry Ellison, a mega-billionaire who has long supported Trump. The younger Ellison has also built rapport with Trump, as the president said last year that Paramount's CEO was \"great\" and would \"do a great job\" running the Hollywood institution.\n\nIf Trump doesn't pick a side, however, those relationships may not help the Ellisons win the battle for Warner Bros.",

    "title": "I went on my first solo trip to celebrate turning 29. Being alone on my birthday felt scary, but it was so worth it.",
    "description": "When I booked my first solo trip for my birthday, I felt nervous about celebrating all on my own. I surprised myself by having an amazing time.",
    "fullText": "I'm a girl who loves her independence. Although I'm a proud extrovert, I live on my own, I like being able to get in my car and drive wherever I want, and I enjoy a good solo date.\n\nAs comfortable as I am doing things alone, though, I still prefer to celebrate really special moments with my loved ones. One of those moments is my birthday.\n\nUnfortunately, in the weeks leading up to my 29th birthday, the stars weren't exactly aligning in my favor. Friends either already had their schedules booked, were tied up with other responsibilities, or just didn't respond when I asked if they were free.\n\nI understand life is busy, but I did feel a bit sad that no one showed a lot of interest in celebrating with me. Still, one thing I'm trying to learn as I get older is that I can't press pause on my happiness just because other people aren't available.\n\nInstead, I booked my very first solo trip to an all-inclusive resort in Cancún, and it ended up being exactly what I needed.\n\nShortly after I landed in Mexico, it hit me that it was my first time traveling outside the US in 24 years — and if you've done the math, that last time was when I was 5 years old.\n\nSimple things like going through immigration at the airport or communicating with my driver in limited Spanish felt very new to me.\n\nWhen I checked in at the resort, the gentleman helping me noticed that I'd listed my birthday as the reason for my reservation. The lady standing at the counter next to me overheard the exchange and asked if I was here on my own.\n\nAfter I said yes, she told me how brave I was to celebrate alone, adding that she would never be able to do that.\n\nHours later, I made my way to dinner at the Mexican restaurant they had on the property — I couldn't wait to take a bite of the chicken fajitas and tres leches cake I saw on the menu. When I got there and requested a table for one, though, I remember the hostess asking, \"Oh really, it's just you?\"\n\nI know she didn't mean any harm, but I started feeling a little self-conscious. Was this all a mistake?\n\nHowever, by the time my order arrived, I was so happy just to eat the yummy food in front of me and admire the sounds of the waterfall in the nearby courtyard that I wasn't really concerned about what other people may have been thinking.\n\nAfter all, I told myself, most people on vacation are probably too preoccupied enjoying themselves to judge anyone else.\n\nBeing on a group trip means you often have to take into consideration several other people's opinions about what to eat, where to go, when to rest … the list goes on.\n\nThe nice thing about being at an all-inclusive alone, though, was that my trip was already somewhat planned. I just got to sit back and handpick the things I actually wanted to do — without any compromises.\n\nSleep in until noon? Sure. Order room service in the middle of the night? Go for it. Attend the morning sip-and-paint class? Check.\n\nIf I wanted to spontaneously take a dip in the ocean even after straightening my hair and putting on a full face of makeup, I could, and no one would stop me.\n\nI did all of these absolutely guilt-free, because I wasn't responsible for anyone else and nobody was waiting on me, either.\n\nGoing on my first major solo trip made me realize I hadn't been prioritizing all my needs.\n\nEven though I really enjoy getting dressed up, I hadn't been putting much time into my appearance, mainly because I work from home and not many people see me throughout the day.\n\nSince it was my birthday week, I made an extra effort to feel pretty, and it instantly uplifted my mood.\n\nI'm also always wishing for more time in my day to read. Although I've historically been a nonfiction reader, I forced myself to bring two romance novels on this vacation as a reminder that I'm allowed to read purely for fun.\n\nI finished reading both books over the six days I was there, and have kept up the habit since returning home.\n\nOverall, this was the first time in a long time I felt confident in living my life as I pleased, without worrying about anyone else's thoughts or concerns.\n\nI love the rain, and on the day of my birthday, there was a short thunderstorm. I felt a sense of childlike joy as I jumped into the lazy river while it was pouring outside.\n\nWhat started as a vacation I was really nervous about turned into the trip I was most sad to leave. Traveling solo on my birthday filled my cup and desperately gave me the rest I needed.\n\nMost of all, it also reminded me to do more things that bring me joy, even if they're scary at first. I came back to California feeling more confident and empowered than ever.\n\nAnd who knows? My 30th birthday is right around the corner, so maybe I'll do it all over again. I think Europe's calling my name.",

    "description": "\"House of the Dragon\" season 3 premieres in June. The first trailer promises plenty of action and bloody battles to come.",
    "fullText": "HBO was betting big on the success of \"House of the Dragon\" long before the season two finale.\n\nThe network renewed the Targaryen-centric \"Game of Thrones\" prequel for another round ahead of the second season premiere in June 2024. Francesca Orsi, HBO's head of drama, praised the team behind the hit fantasy series in the renewal announcement, including author George R. R. Martin and showrunner Ryan Condal.\n\n\"George, Ryan, and the rest of our incredible executive producers, cast, and crew, have reached new heights with the phenomenal second season of 'House of the Dragon,'\" Orsi said in a press release. \"We are in awe of the dragon-sized effort the entire team has put into the creation of a spectacular season two, with a scope and scale that is only rivaled by its heart.\"\n\nAlthough Martin has since stepped back from \"House of the Dragon,\" season three will continue to adapt his fictional history book about House Targaryen, \"Fire & Blood,\" and the civil war known in Westerosi lore as the Dance of the Dragons.\n\nHere's everything we know about season three.\n\nA teaser trailer for \"House of the Dragon\" season three was released on Thursday, days before the first season finale of HBO's newest hit prequel, \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.\"\n\nThe teaser indicates that \"House of the Dragon\" will return in June 2026, though HBO has not set a specific premiere date.\n\nBack in March 2025, once production had officially commenced in the UK, Condal attributed the multi-year gap between seasons to the intricate storyline and the show's budget.\n\n\"There's been no television show in history that ever said, 'We have too much money and too much time to make this,'\" Condal told Entertainment Weekly. \"You're always making decisions as you go along as to, how are we going to use the resources we have right now to tell the best story we can possibly tell? But I appreciate everybody's patience.\"\n\n\"House of the Dragon\" veterans Clare Kilner, Andrij Parekh, and Loni Peristere will return to direct the new eight-episode arc, per EW. They'll be joined by Nina Lopez-Corrado.\n\nThe central conflict in \"House of the Dragon\" is between Rhaenyra Targaryen, the eldest child and chosen heir of the late King Viserys, and her half-brother, Aegon II Targaryen, the late king's eldest son. Fans colloquially refer to the warring siblings and their factions as \"the blacks\" and \"the greens,\" respectively.\n\nAt the end of season two, viewers saw Aegon flee from King's Landing while his mother, Alicent Hightower, secretly colluded with Rhaenyra to give her the Iron Throne.\n\nThe season three teaser offers a glimpse into how this alliance will be received. Although Rhaenyra trusts that Alicent will keep her word to surrender, Rhaenyra's eldest son, Jace, seems to dissuade her from the plan. Meanwhile, Alicent returns to King's Landing to find her second son, Aemond, sitting on the Iron Throne in Aegon's absence.\n\n\"The king has abdicated the throne,\" Aemond says in a voiceover. \"A new dawn is coming. A new line of unsullied kings.\"\n\nHowever, Alicent appears prepared to keep her word, especially knowing that Rhaenyra has recruited a group of Targaryen bastards as dragon riders. Alicent knows the greens are outnumbered, especially with Aegon missing and her daughter, Helaena, unwilling to ride her dragon into battle. It's likely that Rhaenyra will become queen, with or without a surrender.\n\n\"Soon or late, Rhaenyra will send her new dragons here,\" Alicent says in the teaser. \"It would be the end.\"\n\nWe can't say for certain what the season three plot will entail, but there's at least one big battle on the horizon: the Battle of the Gullet.\n\nWhile speaking to EW, Condal promised that season three would cover \"four major events\" from the source material, including the pivotal naval assault known as the Battle of the Gullet, which demands significant production resources. And to the fans who have been begging for more action, rest assured: Condal guaranteed plenty of bloodshed.\n\n\"In many ways, the Gullet has been on the minds of the production for about three years now and trying to figure out how we were going to mount it in a way that was both producible and exciting, thrilling,\" Condal told EW.\n\n\"I would like to think that this is probably the most complex sequence that's ever been done for television,\" he continued, \"not necessarily the most expensive or the longest shoot or anything like that, but just based on the number of moving pieces, the amount of different disciplines, media that have to be blended together to achieve success because you're talking about sea and ships and dragons and action.\"\n\nAs for the other three \"major events\" that Condal promised, there are plenty of historic showdowns, character debuts, and prophesied downfalls that we can predict will occur in season three based on what happens in the book, some of which have already been teased in the show. (\"Fire & Blood\" spoilers ahead!)\n\nThese include Rhaenyra taking over King's Landing; Alicent's youngest son, Daeron, finally entering the narrative; and the deaths of both Aemond and Rhaenyra's husband, Daemon. However, \"House of the Dragon\" has begun to make some bold adaptation choices — so anything could be on the horizon.\n\n\"We're cresting that narrative parabola here and starting to come down into, if not the endgame, the midpoint and getting into the late Act 2 and moving onto the start of Act 3,\" Condal told EW. \"Anybody that's read that book knows that the narrative gets bigger and grimmer as it goes along, and the show has to match that ambition as best it possibly can.\"\n\nIf you want a preview of what's ahead, though, you can pick up \"Fire & Blood\" yourself. You'll probably want to start somewhere in the chapter \"The Dying of the Dragons: The Red Dragon and the Gold\" to catch up on season two and read ahead for what may be to come.\n\nA press release from HBO confirmed the show's big players — among them Emma D'Arcy (Rhaenyra Targaryen), Olivia Cooke (Alicent Hightower), Matt Smith (Daemon Targaryen), Steve Toussaint (Corlys Velaryon), Ewan Mitchell (Aemond Targaryen), Tom Glynn-Carney (Aegon II Targaryen), Harry Collett (Jacaerys Velaryon), Bethany Antonia (Baela Targaryen), Phoebe Campbell (Rhaena Targaryen), Phia Saban (Helaena Targaryen), Sonoya Mizuno (Mysaria), Rhys Ifans (Otto Hightower), and Fabien Frankel (Ser Criston Cole) — will all return for season three.\n\nAs for newcomers, \"Gladiator\" star Tommy Flanagan has been cast as Ser Roderick Dustin, known as \"Roddy the Ruin\" in the book, while \"A Complete Unknown\" actor Dan Fogler will play Torrhen Manderly. Both characters are formidable knights from the North, where House Stark rules.\n\nFarther south, James Norton will make his \"HOTD\" debut as Ormund Hightower, Alicent's cousin and Lord of Oldtown. The season two finale shows a glimpse of Ormund's army marching to counter Rhaenyra's forces accompanied by Daeron and his dragon Tessarion.\n\nOther casting decisions have yet to be publicized. Chief among them is Daeron himself, who was sent away at a young age to squire for Ormund at Oldtown.\n\nCondal confirmed to EW that Daeron will show up soon, but declined to say who will play him.\n\n\"He's a big feature in the book, but if you read the book narrative sequentially, the material we've covered so far didn't really have a lot of call for Daeron in it, which is why we're getting to this now,\" Condal explained.\n\nThere's also the matter of Nettles, a character from \"Fire & Blood\" who claims the dragon Sheepstealer. In the season two finale of \"House of the Dragon,\" Rhaena finally comes across what we presume is the dragon Sheepstealer — but it remains to be seen if she successfully claims the dragon and takes over that storyline, or if Nettles will still appear.\n\nAegon, also known as Aegon the Elder to book readers, suffers near-fatal injuries during season two's battle at Rook's Rest, leaving him mostly immobile.\n\nIn the season two finale, Lord Larys Strong arranges for Aegon to covertly escape King's Landing in anticipation of Rhaenyra's imminent coup. Of all the finale's open-ended questions, Aegon's future seems most uncertain.\n\nThe details of Aegon's period of exile are similarly murky in \"Fire & Blood\" — but don't expect him to disappear from the screen. Condal confirmed that the disgraced king will remain \"a big, big part of the show.\"\n\n\"He's kind of lost to history in the sense that nobody really knows what happened,\" Condal told EW. \"We took that, as the writers, as a great opportunity to figure out. That was one of the great challenges of writing season two: figuring out something that would work and be satisfying, but also not cause ripple effects in the narrative and change where the other big pieces are going. Honestly, I think it's one of the best stories that we cracked this year.\"\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider, Glynn-Carney also teased a revenge-fueled journey for Aegon in season three.\n\n\"Even though his physicality has changed now, I don't particularly think for him, in terms of how unpredictable and how volatile he is — I don't think that's going to change at all,\" the actor said. \"If anything, there will be more. So I'm really looking forward to getting back on season three, and taking him on this next chapter of his journey and really pushing the boundaries even more with him this time.\"\n\nNope! HBO has already confirmed that \"House of the Dragon\" will return for a fourth and final season.\n\nA four-season arc has seemed like the plan for a while. Martin said on his personal blog in October 2022 that he couldn't see \"House of the Dragon\" covering the entire Dance of the Dragons in fewer than four seasons.\n\nMartin has since criticized Condal and HBO for ignoring his objections while writing season three, particularly regarding changes to the source material.\n\n\"What I would say is George introduced us to Ryan as the person that he thought would be the best to create 'House the Dragon,'\" HBO chief Casey Bloys told Deadline. \"And I will say Ryan has been an excellent showrunner and a really great partner and collaborator, so we embrace his vision and his creative choices, or we wouldn't have done it.\"\n\nBloys said that Martin has been focused instead on \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" — aka the \"Tales of Dunk and Egg\" adaptation — on which he's credited as a co-creator and co-executive producer alongside showrunner Ira Parker.\n\n\"The idea that he is going to agree with every creator or showrunner that is either developing or producing, two artists are not always going to agree,\" Bloys added of Martin. \"So, some of this comes with the territory.\"\n\nPalmer Haasch and Caralynn Matassa contributed to an earlier version of this story.",

    "description": "Beale Infrastructure is proposing a data center in Claremore, Oklahoma, a town of about 20,000. Over a hundred locals met to discuss the plans this week.",
    "fullText": "Applause broke out during an Oklahoma man's speech at a city council meeting on Tuesday to discuss a proposed data center. A minute later, shouts of disbelief rang out across the room.\n\n\"Disgusting!\" one woman shouted as Claremore Police Department officers handcuffed and escorted Daniel Blanchard out of the room.\n\nAuthorities said they arrested Blanchard, whose speech exceeded the three-minute time limit, for trespassing.\n\nOver 100 people, including Blanchard, had gathered in a ballroom at Rogers State University in Claremore to voice their opinions about the large data center project. The developer, Beale Infrastructure, is proposing a campus in the Claremore Industrial Park that includes data centers, supporting infrastructure, and office space.\n\nBlanchard was among the residents who opted to speak during the public comment portion, which limits each person to three minutes. In his speech, Blanchard spoke about what he considered compliance issues related to the potential data centers.\n\n\"The Claremore Industrial Economic Development Authority has a fiduciary responsibility to the public, not to build infrastructure. And this act of overreach is putting the health and safety of members of this community at risk,\" he said.\n\nAI is driving a data center construction boom across the United States. While companies like OpenAI argue that building new data centers will reindustrialize the US economy and create jobs, residents of towns where developers are proposing new data centers worry about their impact on power grids, water resources, pollution, and overall quality of life.\n\nIn an investigation published in September, Business Insider reported that over 1,200 data centers had already been built or were approved for construction across the country.\n\nThe proposed data center in Claremore, a suburban hub of Tulsa home to about 20,000 people, has divided the town. During the three-hour meeting on Tuesday evening, dozens of residents spoke both in favor and against the project.\n\nBlanchard exceeded his three minutes by about 30 seconds before police officers approached him. He gathered his notes and calmly followed the officers to the front of the hall, where town officials were sitting.\n\nIn a video of the meeting posted by the town on its YouTube channel, Blanchard appears to hand his notes to a council member. At that point, police arrested Blanchard, placing him in handcuffs. The crowd hollered in shock.\n\nIn a statement, the Claremore Police Department said officers aren't responsible for enforcing city council rules and only become involved in city council meetings when an official orders them to remove an individual.\n\n\"The man's position on the issues, what he said, or his unwillingness to follow rules of the meeting played no part in the officer's decision to arrest him,\" the statement said. \"He was arrested for trespassing in compliance with the law and with the hope of restoring order to an important meeting.\"\n\nA local politician fighting the data center project posted to X on Wednesday that Blanchard has been released from jail. The next council meeting is scheduled for March 2.",

    "title": "A timeline of former Prince Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell's friendship shows they often traveled and partied together",
    "description": "Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was arrested Thursday, previously said Ghislaine Maxwell introduced him to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "fullText": "Many unanswered questions remain about the relationship between Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor — formerly Prince Andrew — and Jeffrey Epstein, but the former royal once said they were introduced by Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nMaxwell, the British socialite who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for sex-trafficking underage girls for Epstein after pleading not guilty, and Mountbatten-Windsor are understood to have enjoyed a close friendship in the '90s and early 2000s, when they were regularly spotted together on the New York and London social scenes.\n\nTwo sources who were interviewed for the 2022 ITV documentary \"Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile\" said that Mountbatten-Windsor and Maxwell were so close that Buckingham Palace staff believed they dated at one point in the early aughts.\n\nIt was also in the early 2000s that Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre alleges Epstein and Maxwell made her sleep with the then-prince on multiple occasions when she was 17.\n\nGiuffre, who died by suicide in April 2025, sued Mountbatten-Windsor in 2021 over allegations he sexually assaulted her at Maxwell's London home, at Epstein's New York home, and on Epstein's private island.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor has long denied the allegations, saying he doesn't recall ever meeting Giuffre. Still, in 2022, they reached a settlement for an undisclosed amount. He has also been stripped of his royal patronages and military and royal titles.\n\nOn Thursday, he was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office amid renewed scrutiny over his relationship with Epstein.\n\nHe has long been tied to Epstein through his friendship with Maxwell. Here's a timeline of their friendship as documented in news reports and interviews over the years.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor said in his infamous November 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight that he'd known Maxwell since her university days.\n\nMaxwell attended Oxford University, graduating in 1985, during which Mountbatten-Windsor was serving in the Royal Navy.\n\nMaxwell also came from a well-connected family. Her father, Robert Maxwell, was the owner of the Daily Mirror newspaper and a onetime member of Parliament before his death in 1991.\n\nMaxwell and Mountbatten-Windsor seemed especially close in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when their outings on the New York and London social scene were widely covered in the press, and the friends were often pictured together.\n\nMaxwell and Epstein were believed to be dating at some point during this era. At Maxwell's child-sex-trafficking trial in 2021, Cimberly Espinosa testified that she worked at Epstein's company from 1996 to 2002, largely as Maxwell's executive assistant. Espinosa said that when she first started at the company, she believed Epstein and Maxwell were dating, but she got the impression they broke up sometime in the last two years of her employment at J. Epstein and Co.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor and Maxwell may have started dating around 2001, according to Paul Page, a former royal protection officer who spoke for the ITV documentary.\n\nPage said he first met Maxwell in 2001, and that Buckingham Palace staff suspected Mountbatten-Windsor and Maxwell had an \"intimate relationship\" by the frequency of her visits.\n\n\"From the way she was allowed to enter and exit the palace, at will, we realized … suspected that she may have had an intimate relationship with Prince Andrew,\" Page said. \"A colleague of mine remembered her coming in four times in one day from the morning till the evening — she kept coming in and out, in and out.\"\n\nAnother source who spoke on the program was Euan Rellie, a banker who said he also became friendly with Maxwell during university.\n\n\"I got the sense that Prince Andrew and Ghislaine had probably been girlfriend and boyfriend in the past,\" Rellie said in the documentary, according to the Telegraph. \"They had an easy warmth around each other.\"\n\nAt the time of the documentary's release, Prince Andrew's press office did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the claims.\n\nOn Thursday, Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office. He was released hours later, and police said an investigation is ongoing.\n\nEarlier this month, following the release of documents from the US Justice Department's Investigation into Epstein, the UK's Thames Valley Police said it was looking into claims that Mountbatten-Windsor shared confidential trade reports with Epstein in 2010, when Mountbatten-Windsor was a trade envoy.\n\nHe has previously denied all allegations against him. In a 2019 statement, he said, \"At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.\"\n\nMountbatten-Windsor has not commented publicly on the recent allegations of misconduct in office.\n\nHours after the arrest on Thursday, King Charles, Mountbatten-Windsor's brother, released a statement saying, \"The law must take its course.\"\n\nIn their own statement, the family of Virginia Giuffre said, \"Today, our broken hearts have been lifted by the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty.\"\n\nEditor's note: A version of this story was previously published in June 2022. It was updated in February 2026.",

    "fullText": "World Liberty Financial, the crypto firm cofounded and partly run by the Trump family, will tokenize loan revenue interest from a new Trump International Hotel and Resort in the Maldives.\n\nTokenization is the process of putting an asset on the blockchain to turn it into a crypto token that can be easily traded, in this case, a loan used to fund the construction of a hotel. Investors who buy tokenized pieces of the loan will be entitled to a portion of the interest payments made on it.\n\nAccording to WLF documents, DT Marks DEFI LLC, which is owned by the Trump family, reserves the right to receive 75% of the revenue generated from $WFLI token sales after expenses.\n\nThe offering won't be available to everyone. Only accredited investors, or those with at least $1 million in liquid assets and who make enough money per year, will be given access to the tokenized loan. The tokens will be offered in partnership with Securitize, Inc. and Dar Global PLC.\n\nThe Trump hotel in the Maldives is set to open in 2030 and was announced in late 2025.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is listed as \"Cofounder Emeritus\" of World Liberty Financial on its website. His three sons — Don Jr., Eric, and Baron — are listed as cofounders, as is Steve Witkoff, who is currently serving as United States special envoy to the Middle East.\n\nWorld Liberty Financial's new tokenization offering is the Trump family's latest move in the crypto space. In January 2025, Trump launched $Trump coin, a meme token that spiked to $45 shortly after launch, and currently trades at $3.40. According to Reuters, the coin made almost $100 million in fees in the first couple weeks after its launch.\n\nWLF also sold a 49% stake in January 2025 to an Emirati royal for $500 million, the Wall Street Journal reported. The firm launched a stablecoin, USD1, last March.\n\nIn addition, Trump Media and Technology Group adopted a crypto treasury strategy last year, buying billions of dollars in bitcoin. According to a Bloomberg report, crypto had boosted the Trump family's net worth by $1.4 billion as of January 2026.\n\nThe token offering from WLF comes as crypto assets endure a brutal bear market as funds flee the space. Bitcoin's price is down 45% from October's high, while ethereum has fallen 59% since August.",

The email did not explain what classifies a school as a risk.\n\nProspective military students should have a \"backup plan\" in case the Pentagon cuts ties with these schools, the email said.\n\nScreenshots of the message circulated online last week, catching many people by surprise. Universities, professors, and service members told Business Insider they felt blindsided.\n\nThe internal email identified Harvard as \"fully off limits\" to service members pursuing higher education through Department of Defense-funded programs.

    "description": "Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office. Here's a timeline of his ties to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "fullText": "A member of the royal family was arrested at Sandringham Estate on Thursday morning.\n\nAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, was arrested at the royal home on suspicion of misconduct in public office related to his ties to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nKing Charles said in a statement of the arrest that \"the law must take its course\" and that the authorities had the royal family's \"full and wholehearted support and co-operation.\"\n\nMountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied any involvement with Epstein's sex-trafficking crimes. However, his relationship with Epstein has been under scrutiny for over a decade, as Virginia Giuffre named him in a lawsuit she filed against Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2015.\n\nThat scrutiny only intensified after the recent release of documents in the Epstein files. According to emails released, the former prince appeared to forward reports related to his work as UK trade envoy to Epstein in 2010 and 2011.\n\nHere's a timeline of Mountbatten-Windsor's connection to Epstein.\n\nAs the BBC reported, Ghislaine Maxwell introduced Epstein to Mountbatten-Windsor in 1999.\n\nThe trio remained friends throughout the early 2000s, with Epstein and Maxwell attending parties at Windsor Castle and Sandringham. The three were also photographed together at events, including a 2000 party at Mar-a-Lago with Donald and Melania Trump and the 2000 Royal Ascot. Epstein and Maxwell were also photographed at Princess Beatrice's 18th birthday party in July 2006, the BBC reported.\n\nIn 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18, and was sentenced to 18 months. Mountbatten-Windsor visited Epstein in New York in December 2010, just four months after Epstein's release.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor said it was a \"mistake and an error\" to visit Epstein after he was convicted of the sex crime in a statement released by Buckingham Palace in August 2019.\n\nIn 2015, Virginia Giuffre brought a defamation case against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, alleging that the pair had sex-trafficked her starting in 2000, when she was known as Virginia Roberts.\n\nGiuffre alleged that Epstein forced her to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor in his New York mansion, in London, and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands in 2001 when she was 17.\n\nHowever, the allegation was thrown out and struck from the record by a judge, who said it was \"immaterial and impertinent to the central claim\" in the case at the time.\n\nFurther details about Giuffre's allegations against Mountbatten-Windsor were made public in 2019, after documents from the 2015 defamation case were unsealed.\n\nIn the documents related to sex-trafficking charges against Epstein, witness Johanna Sjoberg told investigators about a sexual incident that she said happened, and involved herself, Maxwell, Mountbatten-Windsor, Giuffre, and a puppet of the prince.\n\n\"Andrew and Virginia sat on the couch, and they put the puppet ... on her lap,\" Sjoberg was quoted as saying in the documents. \"I sat on Andrew's lap, I believe on my own volition, and they took the puppet's hands and put it on Virginia's breast, and so Andrew put his on mine.\"\n\nBuckingham Palace denied Mountbatten-Windsor's alleged involvement with Giuffre in a statement at the time.\n\n\"It is emphatically denied that The Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts,\" the palace's statement read. \"Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.\"\n\nMountbatten-Windsor made a statement after Epstein was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell on August 10, 2019, saying he sympathized \"with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.\"\n\nMountbatten-Windsor added that during the time he knew Epstein, he did not witness or \"suspect any behavior of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.\"\n\nGiuffre responded with a statement of her own. Speaking to reporters outside a Manhattan court at the time, she said the prince \"knows exactly what he's done, and I hope he comes clean about it.\"\n\nDiscussing the allegations in a BBC \"Newsnight\" interview with host Emily Maitlis on November 16, 2019, Mountbatten-Windsor suggested that a photo appearing to show him with his hand around Giuffre's waist was fake.\n\nHe also said during the interview that on the night Giuffre alleged they had dinner, partied at a club in London called Tramp, and later had sex, that he was at home with his daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie.\n\nThe interview was perceived negatively and labeled a \"car crash\" by much of the British media.\n\nFollowing the interview, a string of charities, businesses, and universities cut ties with Mountbatten-Windsor, and on November 20, 2019, the duke announced he would step back from his royal duties.\n\n\"It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family's work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support,\" Mountbatten-Windsor said in a statement.\n\nAfter saying that the Queen had given him her permission to step back from his duties, Mountbatten-Windsor said he continued \"to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.\"\n\nHe added that he would be \"willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.\"\n\nIn a complaint filed at a New York federal court in August 2021, Giuffre said Mountbatten-Windsor was aware of her age and that she was a victim of sex trafficking when she was forced to have sex with him in 2001.\n\n\"I am holding Prince Andrew accountable for what he did to me. The powerful and the rich are not exempt from being held responsible for their actions,\" Giuffre said, via her lawyers, in a statement to ABC.\n\nJudge Lewis A. Kaplan denied Mountbatten-Windsor's motion to dismiss Giuffre's lawsuit on January 12, 2022, ruling that it was \"denied in all respects,\" allowing the case to proceed to trial. The new ruling did not preclude the parties from settling before the trial.\n\nA day later, Buckingham Palace issued a statement announcing that Mountbatten-Windsor would face the lawsuit as a private citizen.\n\n\"With The Queen's approval and agreement, The Duke of York's military affiliations and Royal patronages have been returned to The Queen,\" a spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said in a statement sent to Business Insider. \"The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen.\"\n\nMountbatten-Windsor stopped using the HRH title in any official capacity after the removal of the patronages and military affiliations, a royal source told Business Insider.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor settled with Giuffre on February 15, 2022, according to court documents obtained by Business Insider.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor intended to make a \"substantial donation to Ms. Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights,\" the sum of which was not disclosed, according to a joint statement made in the court filing.\n\nThe statement added: \"Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms. Giuffre's character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks. It is known that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked countless young girls over many years.\"\n\nGiuffre died by suicide in April 2025, just over three years after they reached a settlement.\n\nIn October 2022, The Mail on Sunday published an interview with Maxwell, who was imprisoned at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, at the time after being sentenced to 20 years in prison for sex trafficking girls for Epstein.\n\nIn the interview, she referred to Mountbatten-Windsor as her \"dear friend\" and expressed concern for him.\n\n\"He is paying such a price for the association with Jeffrey Epstein,\" Maxwell said. \"I care about him, and I feel so bad for him.\"\n\nMaxwell's comments contradicted those of Mountbatten-Windsor, who denied he was close to Maxwell during his legal proceedings with Guiffre.\n\nAs part of a lawsuit between an Epstein accuser and Maxwell, a New York judge unsealed the names of more than 170 of Epstein's associates.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor was among those identified in the documents, as were Bill Clinton and Donald Trump.\n\nThe documents further undermined Mountbatten-Windsor's assertion that he wasn't close friends with Maxwell or Epstein, as the manager of Epstein's Palm Beach home, Juan Alessi, said in a 2009 deposition that the former prince spent weeks at Epstein's home and received \"daily massages.\"\n\nIn addition, Alessi said Sarah Ferguson, the ex-wife of Mountbatten-Windsor, was also a close friend of Epstein.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor tried to rehabilitate his image in 2024 and early 2025 and return to the public eye. Still, the continual release of new information about his relationship with Epstein made his attempts futile.\n\nOn October 17, 2025, Mountbatten-Windsor announced he was giving up his royal titles.\n\n\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" the statement said. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"\n\n\"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further,\" he went on to say. \"I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"\n\nThe royal stopped being known as Prince Andrew after the announcement, going by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nThe January 30, 2026, drop of Epstein files included photos of Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to kneel over an unidentified woman, who was clothed and lying on the floor. It's unclear when or where the photos were taken.\n\nThe files also include emails between Epstein and an account called \"The Duke,\" who signs his emails \"A,\" as well as exchanges between Epstein and Ferguson.\n\nOn Thursday, Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office. It was his 66th birthday.\n\nThe former prince served as UK trade envoy from 2001 to 2011, and the Epstein files appear to show Mountbatten-Windsor forwarding emails with his official work reports to the disgraced financier in 2010 and 2011.\n\n\"Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,\" Oliver Wright, the assistant chief constable with the Thames Valley Police, said. \"It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence.\"\n\nKing Charles released a statement about the arrest on Thursday.\n\n\"I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,\" it said. \"What now follows is the full, fair, and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities. In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation.\"\n\n\"Let me state clearly: the law must take its course,\" the king's statement went on to say. \"As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.\"\n\nPolice were photographed at Sandringham estate in Norfolk, where Mountbatten-Windsor had been living, as well as his previous residence in Berkshire, on Thursday, carrying out searches of the properties.\n\nThe police released Mountbatten-Windsor \"under investigation\" around 11 hours after his arrest, AP reported. He was photographed leaving the Aylsham Police Station in a car.",

    "fullText": "For centuries, the British royal family has cultivated an image of duty and decorum. As public figures, they've also had their share of scandals.\n\nForbidden romances, tabloid firestorms, and allegations of misconduct have rocked the House of Windsor over the years.\n\nHere's a look at some of the biggest scandals involving royal family members.\n\nDirectly after his father died in 1936, Edward VIII took the throne. Less than a year later, he renounced it.\n\nThat's because he had fallen hard for Wallis Simpson, an American socialite who'd already been divorced once and was working through her second. His proposal of marriage caused social and political uproar, since the Church of England technically forbade Edward from marrying someone who'd been divorced. Eventually, Edward was forced to abdicate.\n\n\"I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King [...] without the help and support of the woman I love,\" he said in a radio address to the nation in December 1936.\n\nEdward and Simpson married in 1937 and stayed together until Edward's death in 1972. (And she wasn't the only commoner who married into royalty.)\n\nCaptain Peter Townsend was a Royal Air Force officer who served as an equerry — essentially an attendant to the royal family. He spent a great deal of time with Margaret, and before long, the two fell in love. The only problem was that he was married.\n\nThings got even more scandalous in 1953 when Townsend divorced his wife and proposed to Margaret, but the rules of the Church of England forbade such a marriage. (After all, Margaret's uncle Edward VIII had to relinquish the throne in order to marry a divorcee.)\n\nThe relationship came to a heartbreaking close in 1955 when they called off the engagement. There was simply no way for Captain Townsend and Princess Margaret to have a happy ending.\n\nNot long after calling things off with Townsend, Margaret married photographer Anthony Armstrong Jones. It was the first royal wedding to ever be televised.\n\nA few years later, their union became a source of \"growing public ridicule,\" The New York Times reported. They fought in public, Margaret took long vacations without her husband, and rumors swirled around her close friendship with a man 17 years her junior.\n\nIn 1976, the couple announced their separation, and two years later, they were officially divorced. Margaret became the first royal to divorce since Henry VIII, who reigned way back in the 1500s.\n\nIn 1992 — while then-Prince Charles and Princess Diana were still married — media outlets published the transcript of a conversation between Diana and an alleged lover named James Gilbey. In the conversation, Gilbey told Diana that he loved her and called her by the pet name \"Squidgy\" 53 times. That's how the scandal earned the memorable moniker \"Squidgygate.\"\n\nLater, in an interview, Diana confirmed that the conversation was real, but denied that it was adulterous in nature.\n\nNot long after Diana's leaked phone call, Charles, Queen Elizabeth's oldest son, had one of his own.\n\nAn Australian magazine published the transcript of a call between Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles — a longtime married friend. The transcript all but confirmed what many rumors had postulated: That Charles and Camilla were romantically involved.\n\nIn one of the more confounding parts of the conversation, the couple joked about Charles turning into a tampon in order to \"live inside\" Camilla's trousers.\n\nLater that year, Charles and Diana announced their separation.\n\nIn 1995, Diana sat down for a tell-all solo interview with journalist Martin Bashir to talk about the immense pressures of public life and her struggles with self-harm, postpartum depression, and bulimia. She also revealed that she knew about Charles' affair with Camilla. (\"There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded,\" she famously quipped.) And Diana even admitted that she'd been unfaithful to Charles, saying that she had been \"in love\" with James Hewitt, her riding instructor.\n\nThe BBC interview itself has since come under scrutiny. An article in the Sunday Times in 2020 alleged that Bashir manipulated Diana into doing the interview by showing her brother, Charles Spencer, fake bank statements that purported to show the media had been paying royal associates for information about her. A 2021 inquiry concluded that Bashir acted in a \"deceitful\" way, and the BBC and Bashir apologized.\n\nA few weeks after the interview, the Queen herself urged her son and daughter-in-law to divorce, and the following year, they made it official. Charles and Camilla, on the other hand, wed in 2005 and are still together.\n\nPrincess Anne, the only daughter of Queen Elizabeth II, married Olympic equestrian Mark Phillips in 1973. The couple spent large swaths of time apart and didn't appear to be happy — People magazine described the marriage as a \"joyless sham.\"\n\nThen, in spring 1989, a British newspaper obtained stolen copies of letters written to Anne by one of her equerries, a British naval officer named Timothy Laurence. Though the content of the letters wasn't made public, tabloids described them as \"extremely intimate\" and \"too hot to handle.\"\n\nIn 1992, Anne announced that she was divorcing Phillips, and that she planned to marry Laurence. The two have been together ever since.\n\nSarah Ferguson (popularly known as \"Fergie\") married Queen Elizabeth's son, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, in 1986.\n\nSix years later, scandal erupted: Paparazzi photographers captured Fergie vacationing with an American financial advisor named John Bryan. In one photo — an image quickly plastered on the front page of The Sun — Bryan appeared to be licking Fergie's foot.\n\nThings didn't go very well after that. Fergie and Andrew separated in 1992, the same year as Charles and Diana, and divorced in 1996.\n\nFergie's marital drama didn't end after the divorce. In 2010, a News of the World journalist posed as a businessman and said he got Fergie to accept a £500,00 (about $633,000) bribe in exchange for access to her ex-husband, The Guardian reported.\n\nA video recording of their meeting was released to the media, and Fergie later apologized, saying she'd made a \"serious lapse in judgment,\" Reuters reported.\n\nAfter admitting to his father that he'd tried marijuana, a 17-year-old Prince Harry spent a day at the Featherstone Lodge rehabilitation center in London, The Telegraph reported.\n\nA statement from the royal family said Harry had agreed to visit the clinic \"to learn about the possible consequences of starting to take cannabis.\"\n\nIn January 2005, British paper The Sun published a front-page photo of Harry wearing a Nazi armband, apparently at a costume party.\n\nThe prince, who was 20 at the time, quickly released a statement of apology that read: \"Prince Harry has apologised for any offence or embarrassment he has caused. He realises it was a poor choice of costume.\"\n\nThe British tabloid published the naked photos of the prince in 2012, which were taken by another party-goer during a game of strip billiards in his hotel suite.\n\nAccording to an anonymous source who was in attendance, the prince's security team appeared to be aware that people were taking photos.\n\n\"No one asked for our phones or anything about us when we arrived at the party,\" the source told The Sun. \"It was obvious people were taking pictures.\"\n\nAt the time the pictures were taken, Prince William and Kate Middleton were staying in a private holiday home owned by the Queen's nephew, Viscount Linley.\n\nAfter the couple won a lawsuit against the company, Closer was ordered to pay $118,000 in damages to William and Kate in 2017.\n\nAndrew served as the UK's trade envoy from 2001 through 2011, when he stepped down due to mounting criticism over some of his personal relationships, the BBC reported. Namely, he was close friends with American sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThis would not be the end of the matter, however.\n\nVirginia Giuffre, pictured with Andrew above, accused Epstein of forcing her to have sex with the prince when she was just 17 years old in 2001.\n\nThe allegations from a 2015 defamation case resurfaced in the media as the case became unsealed. Andrew denied the claims, and a spokesperson for Buckingham Palace \"emphatically denied\" the allegations in an August 2019 statement provided to Business Insider.\n\nFour days after a catastrophic interview with \"BBC Newsnight\" where he spoke about his friendship with Epstein, Andrew announced he would step down from his royal duties.\n\nEpstein was found dead in his prison cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.\n\nGiuffre died by suicide in 2025.\n\nMarkle sued the publication over the misuse of private information, infringement of copyright, and breach of the Data Protection Act 2018 after it published excerpts from the letter earlier this year. She won the lawsuit in 2021.\n\n\"I share this victory with each of you — because we all deserve justice and truth, and we all deserve better,\" Markle said in a statement.\n\nA judge later rejected the publisher's application for permission to appeal but said it can take the application to the Court of Appeals. The publisher, Associated Newspapers, said it would.\n\nThe announcement said they \"intend to step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen.\" They also wrote that they would split their time between North America and the UK.\n\nThe royal communications office followed up with a statement of their own.\n\n\"Discussions with The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage,\" the Queen's statement read. \"We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.\"\n\nThe couple carried out their last official royal engagement at the annual Commonwealth Day service in London in March 2020. They later bought a home in California.\n\nThe two-hour primetime special was full of stunning revelations.\n\nMarkle told Winfrey that Kate Middleton made her cry the week of her wedding over a flower girl dress and not the other way around, as had been reported in tabloids. She also said members of the royal family had \"concerns and conversations\" about how dark Archie's skin would be before he was born, and The Firm told them that Archie wouldn't receive a title or security, breaking from protocol.\n\nShe also opened up about having suicidal thoughts amid constant tabloid criticism and racism, and said a senior member of the royal institution wouldn't let her seek help.\n\nHarry revealed that his family cut him off financially in the first quarter of 2020, and that Charles stopped taking his phone calls before they announced they were stepping back from the royal family. He also said that it hurts that the royal family never acknowledged tabloids' racist treatment of Markle, and that none of the royal family members have reached out to apologize for the reasons he felt he had to leave.\n\nFollowing the interview, Buckingham Palace released a statement on behalf of the Queen.\n\n\"The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan,\" the statement read.\n\n\"The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. Whilst some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately.\n\n\"Harry, Meghan, and Archie will always be much loved family members.\"\n\nAndrew was arrested at his home in Sandringham, Norfolk, on February 19 and was released from police custody several hours later. An investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe Justice Department's Epstein files revealed additional communications between Andrew and Epstein when the former prince was a UK trade envoy. Police conducted searches of his Sandringham home and at his former home in Windsor, Berkshire.\n\n\"I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,\" Charles said in a statement. \"What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities.\"\n\nThe king's statement continued: \"In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation. Let me state clearly: the law must take its course. As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.\"",

    "title": "What It Actually Means to 'Tone' Your Muscles",
    "description": "Muscles can get bigger and stronger, but they don't get toned-er. Sort of.",
    "fullText": "The word “toning” is something of a joke in many fitness circles, because it’s a word that’s thrown around when people mean other things. Sometimes it’s a code word for being thin, as when somebody may promise you that a workout will tone your muscles rather than making you bulky. Other times it’s a moneymaking gambit, as when somebody says you can do their toning exercises at home rather than buying weights or a gym membership instead.\n\nTo the extent that the word means anything, we talked about this a bit when we discussed the fear of getting bulky. Being “toned” usually means having some muscle definition while still being able to see your body as feminine or thin. \"Toned\" isn't anything in human biology—it's a word we use when walking a tightrope of ways we hope to be perceived.\n\nWhen you ask your muscles to do something, they get better at doing it. While entire dissertations have been written about exactly what happens inside your muscle cells when you exercise, the ways we change our muscles when we lift weights mostly fall into two categories:\n\nYou get better at using that muscle (neuromuscular adaptations)\n\nThe muscle gets bigger (hypertrophy)\n\nOf those two things, only the second one (the muscle getting bigger) has a visual impact. Both of them affect how strong you are, or to put it another way, what you can do with that muscle. Getting stronger and getting bigger happen together: You can try to favor one over the other, but training for strength will get you bigger muscles as a side effect, and training for bigger muscles is pretty much impossible without also getting stronger.\n\nNow, the human body is complex, so of course there aren’t only two things that happen. But those are the main ones. Other things that happen, if less noticeably:\n\nYour muscles get better at contracting repeatedly (muscular endurance)\n\nYou burn calories during the workout\n\nThese features aren’t exclusive to strength training. You burn calories and build endurance with cardio, too, such as running.\n\nThese last two items do not have a visible effect on your body. You can’t tell how good somebody’s endurance is by looking at them. Burning calories can theoretically result in fat loss, or even muscle loss, but that also depends on how many calories you eat. Exercise, by itself, does not necessarily change the amount of fat on your body.\n\nWhen we look at the visible changes we can make to our bodies through exercise, there are really only two things we can control:\n\nWe can make specific muscles bigger with resistance training (such as lifting weights)\n\nWe can eat fewer calories than we burn, while also resistance training to preserve muscle; this causes us to lose fat all over our bodies.\n\nNote that you can target which muscles you want to get bigger, but there’s no way to lose fat on a specific body part. Fat distribution isn’t really under our control, which is why you can’t exercise your way to a flat tummy, or slim your thighs, or anything like that. You can work your muscles to make them bigger, and eat in a calorie deficit to make your whole body smaller, and see what happens.\n\nTo address a few other things that get discussed alongside toning: You can’t build “long, lean muscles” specifically. Lean just means without fat, so if you want to look lean, you’re looking at fat loss.\n\nAnd the length of a muscle isn’t something you can control: It’s attached to your bones. How would it get longer? Sometimes people mean that they want their muscles not to look rounded or not to have a peak in their bicep, but that’s not really under our control either. The shape of your muscle comes down to things like its attachment points and the length of your tendons versus the contractile portion of the muscles. Those are just things you’re born with, and training can't really change them.\n\nBased on what we know so far, you’d expect that if you want muscle definition while looking slimmer, you’d need to lift weights and pay attention to your diet. (You would also be smart to do some cardio, which is good for your health and won’t kill your gains).\n\nSo then what’s with all these “toning” workouts? Isn’t there a “toning” rep range? Don’t you need smaller weights for “toning” than for getting jacked? What gives? Well, I hate to break it to you, but that’s all bullshit people say to sell stuff.\n\nHere’s the truth about rep ranges: Anything up to about 15 reps will do a pretty good job of growing your muscles and making you stronger. Anything up to about 30 reps can still grow your muscles if you take the lift to failure (that is, by rep 30 your muscles are burning and you literally can’t do another rep). Beyond that—or if you’re doing a high rep set but you put the dumbbells down before you hit failure—you’re not doing much to increase the size or strength of your muscles. You’re still working on endurance, but endurance isn’t going to do much to change how your body looks.\n\nWhat about the size of your weights? Well, to hit those appropriate rep ranges, you need to lift weights that are “heavy” for you. Maybe you’re new to this and five pounds is a really challenging bicep curl. Perfect! That’s your “heavy,” for now. As you get stronger, you’ll need heavier weights. (Keep in mind, though: different exercises use different muscle groups. Somebody who uses a five-pound weight for curls is going to need a heavier weight for goblet squats.)\n\nIf your muscle-building exercises don’t involve weights, the same principles still apply. If it’s hard for you to do 10 air squats, then air squats are helping you to build muscle in your legs and butt. But if you can do 50, you’ll need to either add some weight or find a different no-equipment exercise that is appropriately challenging.\n\nIf you’re determined to get “toned,” the muscular training you need to do is no different than what a person would do to get jacked. The difference is that getting jacked involves a lot of food (that muscle has to come from somewhere) and a lot of time. Even if you spend all your time in the gym, you won’t come out looking like the Hulk at the end of the year. That’s bad news for people who want to look like the Hulk, and good news for people who don’t.\n\nSo you need to do normal-ass strength training. With that in mind, let’s look at a couple of workouts that get marketed as being for “toning”:\n\nHIIT workouts: True HIIT workouts improve your aerobic capacity (making you a faster runner, for example) but they don’t have any special advantage in calorie burning or muscle building. A lot of popular ones aren’t even real HIIT, they’re just circuit training.\n\nCircuit training: Doing a series of different exercises with little to no rest, and then repeating that series, is called circuit training. It’s a mix of strength training and cardio, which makes it a good choice if you don’t have time to do two separate workouts. Crossfit WODs (workout of the day) fall into this category, too. You’ll probably get better results if you separate the strength and cardio components, but if you enjoy circuit training, it’ll do the job.\n\nHigh-rep exercises without weights or with light weights: A lot of booty band and ankle weight workouts fall into this category. If they feel hard enough to count as strength training, great! But most are not, especially once you’re not a beginner anymore. At that point, they’re just training endurance without actually building muscle. If you like them, or if endurance is important to you, enjoy. But they’re not going to “tone” you at all.",

    "title": "Eight Gadgets That Can Turn Your Microwave Into a More Versatile Appliance",
    "description": "Microwaves are essential kitchen appliances, but they have limitations—unless you pair them with the right tools.",
    "fullText": "Just about everyone has a microwave. You might not know its wattage, vintage, or what in the heck half the buttons actually do, but you know that if you pop something in there and cook it for a while, you get hot food back for your trouble. Some intrepid souls actually learn how to use a microwave properly, expertly timing out defrostings, reheatings, and popcorn by the bucket. They really are incredibly useful and powerful appliances.\n\nAs amazing as your microwave is, it could be better—it just needs a little help. If you really want to get the most out of your appliance, you’ll need to pick up a few microwave gadgets that will expand its capabilities and take out some of the guesswork.\n\nFirst and foremost, we all know one of the main frustrations with microwaves: You can typically only cook/heat one dish at a time. If you’re warming up some leftovers for yourself and a partner, someone’s plate is going to sit on the counter for a bit, cooling off, while the second one cooks. And if you’re trying to actually cook an entire meal with your microwave, you’re going to have a heck of a time serving everything up at a consistent temperature.\n\nUnless you invest in a microwave-safe plate stacker. It’s a simple idea that instantly makes your microwave more useful, because you can now cook or heat up several things at once.\n\nCan you cook eggs in the microwave without a cool gadget? Sure—as long as you’re not terribly picky about how your eggs turn out. If you’d prefer to enjoy eating the eggs you cook in there, you should pick up an egg boiler to make hard- or soft-boiled eggs, and an egg cooker that can poach or scramble an egg perfectly (it can also make adorable mini-omelets). These little tools ensure your eggs come out fluffy and delicious instead of rubbery and weird-looking.\n\nEntire restaurant chains have been built on our collective love of toasted sandwiches, but they’re impossible to make in a microwave ... unless you have one of these sandwich maker gadgets. With one, you can make grilled cheese sandwiches, panini, or even quesadillas to your heart’s content without firing up your burner.\n\nYou can cook anything in a microwave, as long as your working definition of “cooked” is just “hot.” As anyone who’s ever tried in desperation to cook bacon in their microwave knows, what you get is a soggy mass of bacon-esque stuff. Unless you have this microwaveable bacon grill, which makes it possible to cook up crispy bacon without dealing with a greasy pan that spits pain at you, or the lengthy cleanup it requires.\n\nA rice cooker is a terrific appliance if you make a lot of rice, but sometimes you don’t have room for one more countertop or stovetop appliance, and not everyone makes rice often enough to need one. This cheap microwave rice cooker makes it dead simple to cook a batch of rice in your microwave in a little over 10 minutes, and the rice comes out fluffy, slightly sticky, and delicious.\n\nCooking dry pasta isn’t exactly rocket science. Even if you don’t bother reading directions or don’t really care about al dente pasta, it’s just a matter of boiling water, dumping in pasta, and cooking until it’s soft and edible.\n\nBut if you need to cut some corners and skip the time it takes to boil water, you can cook pasta to a very acceptable level of al dente-ness in the microwave with the Fasta Pasta Microwave Cooker. It’s only usable with dry pasta—fresh pasta will still have to be boiled, sorry—but it ensures perfect pasta every time in just a few minutes, without any boiling necessary. It even has pre-measured cutouts in the lid so you can easily portion out your meals.\n\nIt happens: You’re craving cake, and you have no cake. You have all the ingredients for cake, but you lack the most important thing: The will to pull it all together, fire up the oven, and wait.\n\nEnter the Rapid Cake Maker. Put your mix, eggs, and other ingredients into the appropriate (and pre-measured) container, combine in the pan and mix, then microwave for 5-6 minutes. That’s right, that’s all that stands between you and a warm, moist cake. We are truly living in the future.\n\nSteaming is a nice method to cook fresh-tasting vegetables and fish. Steaming on a stovetop can produce a fair amount of dirty dishes, though—or maybe you're just low on stovetop space. Steaming in your microwave using one of these, on the other hand, is a fast and easy alternative. Add water to the bottom, adjust the vents, cover, and in a few minutes your food is cooked perfectly. It can be used with fresh or frozen veggies or anything else you would normally steam cook.",

    "title": "Some Samsung Users Are Already Reporting Dead Screens on Their $2,900 Galaxy Z TriFold Phones",
    "description": "Which is why you should always be careful if you choose to early adopt.",
    "fullText": "Starting at the end of last month, Samsung finally started selling its first trifolding phone in the U.S. Customers who were willing to spend an eye-watering $2,900 were able to snag a 10-inch display that folds up to fit in a pocket, but as with many first-gen devices, it turns out there have been a few growing pains. Two users who took the plunge on the Samsung Galaxy Z Trifold have shared on Reddit that their screens are already unresponsive—but to Samsung's credit, the company isn't leaving them hanging.\n\nThe first user, who had their phone for about a month and a half (they bought their unit while overseas) before issues appeared, posted three days ago that their inner screen had started periodically flashing green before cutting to black, after which it would be unresponsive. Sometimes, restarts appeared to fix the issue immediately, while in other cases, the phone would need to stay on for a few hours first before a restart would fix the problem.\n\nThe other report is a bit more concerning, and claims the user's inner screen completely died within just five days of purchase. According to this user, the issue first started showing up as ghost touching, or the device recognizing touches when there weren't any. The following day, the screen was pure white, and has remained unresponsive since. Alongside the white screen, the user also reported hearing a \"strange popping sound\" while closing the device and seeing what appeared to be an air bubble underneath the screen.\n\nBoth reports follow a less severe one from a Korean user, who said in mid-January that their phone had a line of dead pixels down the lefthand side of the device. All three users have posted photographic evidence alongside their complaints.\n\nFor the American users, neither said they put their device through any stress, with the first saying their issues popped up \"during normal usage\" and the second saying they \"have done nothing but baby\" their phone. While we can't know for sure what happened with these phones without seeing them ourselves, some users do have speculation. For the device that flashed green, one Redditor suggested that's indicative of a bad ribbon cable, something I can confirm I've seen on other devices. As for the device with the unresponsive white screen, one user pointed to defects in other first-gen foldables, something that has been seen on both the Galaxy Z Fold 1 and the original Pixel Fold.\n\nAs for the dead pixels on the Korean phone, the users' post did not mention how the issue first appeared, at least going by a machine translation.\n\nIt's disappointing to see such big investments immediately disappoint these users, but all have had luck in contacting Samsung support. The first user with a dead screen posted an update today that said Samsung is repairing their phone for free, although it'll take 1-3 weeks for them to get the device back. The second said they opted for a return instead, and will return to the cheaper Galaxy Z Fold 7 rather than use the new device. \"5 days is a little silly for hardware failure,\" they said of their decision. Finally, the Korean user with dead pixels said that Samsung replaced their device for free, while taking their old one \"for research.\"\n\nWhile these are only a few users' experiences, it's not a great look for Samsung, and it's a good reminder to be careful if you choose to early adopt. If you do choose to go in on a Trifold, it might be worth buying a Samsung Care+ plan alongside it, to help protect your $2,900 investment from accidental damage or keep it eligible for repairs after the warranty expires. \n\nGranted, you'll have at least one day before you need to make that decision. The Galaxy Z Trifold is once again out of stock in the U.S., but a new batch is set to drop tomorrow. Hopefully, this batch will be a bit more durable than the last.",

    "description": "Reviews, images, and even some restaurants are missing from the map.",
    "fullText": "I use Google Maps to get from point A to point B, but I also use it for research. It's an essential tool for finding new restaurants to try, or for identifying well-reviewed hotels in a new area. While many use it with their Google account, others might like to keep some of their data out of Google's hands. Using Google Maps while signed out is a good way to do that: You can find new locations of interest without having Google know you're interested in those spots. However, if you like using Google Maps without an account, be warned: The experience is now much more limited.\n\nAs reported by 9to5Google, Google is now limiting the amount of data visible when accessing Google Maps without an account. This change includes things like images, reviews, restaurants, businesses, hotels, parks—really, most labels on the map. From what I can tell, essential labels like city names and highway identifiers are left intact, but even some street names appear to be omitted when logged out.\n\nIf you can find restaurants in limited view, you'll see some of the data points that you'd normally find, but you'll also notice a number missing as well. That could include labels noting whether the restaurants supports takeout or delivery, user reviews, popular times, photos and videos submitted by users, menus, as well as related locations. I tested it myself in an incognito window, scrolled randomly over Richmond, VA, and clicked the first (of few) restaurants to appear: Laura Lee's. While I could see the total star rating (4.6), I couldn't actually click through to any reviews. I could also only see the primary image of the restaurant. There's enough here to decide whether or not to call, but it's missing a ton of the data points you'd usually rely on to consider a spot for lunch or dinner.\n\nGoogle doesn't necessarily pin the limited view on you being logged out, however. If you check the \"Help\" pop-up that appears here, titled \"Seeing a limited view of Google Maps,\" the company explains that there are a few reasons you might be seeing this view. That could include issues with Google Maps itself, unusual traffic from your computer or network, or browser extensions that might be interfering with Google Maps. Only after it lists these reasons does Google suggest that signing in to Google Maps \"might help you avoid seeing this limited experience again.\"\n\nOf course, logging in brings all this data back as you'd expect, and if you always use Google Maps with your Google account, you'll never notice the difference. But it's an interesting line in the sand for Google to draw. How many people who use Google Maps without an account will know this is the reason why their experience just got worse? Perhaps they'll flock to another option, though there aren't many. Apple users have Apple Maps, and there's always Waze—but, surprise, it's owned by Google too.",

    "title": "Microsoft Is Now Testing a 'Built-In' Network Speed Test Tool in Windows 11",
    "description": "It's more of a shortcut to a web tool.",
    "fullText": "When your internet isn't as fast as it should be, it can be helpful to check a network speed test tool. If the results are slower than expected, you'll know it's your network that's acting up. If it's performing well, perhaps it's the website in question, your web browser, or the device itself that's in need of a tune up. You have plenty of options across the internet to choose from, of course, but if you have a PC, you're about to get one built right into the OS—at least, in theory.\n\nAs part of the latest Release Preview Channel update for Windows 11 Insiders, Microsoft rolled out a network speed test tool, though \"shortcut\" might be a more appropriate word. This shortcut isn't its own app; rather, you access it directly from the taskbar. You right-click the network icon, choose the \"Perform speed test\" option, and, subsequently, Windows fires up your browser. You'll see Bing load up—even if you have another search engine of choice as your default—where a simplified \"Internet speed test\" tool appears.\n\nWhile I wouldn't blame you for assuming this tool was a Microsoft creation, it's actually made by Speedtest, of speedtest.net fame. (Disclosure: Lifehacker's parent company, Ziff Davis, owns Speedtest.) As Tom's Hardware highlights, the integration itself isn't actually new, as Speedtest first started running a network speed tool within Bing back in December of 2023. The news now, of course, is that this tool is available as a shortcut within the Windows taskbar itself.\n\nIt's a neat addition to Windows, and makes sense to include within the network icon in the taskbar, but something that actually runs natively on your PC would certainly be better. Maybe the convenience of quickly right-clicking the network icon whenever my internet was slow would win out, but I imagine I'd rather head to the full Speedtest tool, especially to avoid using Bing.\n\nThis shortcut isn't the only thing new here. Microsoft also added new settings options that let you pan and tilt connected cameras. There are new emojis on the way, including face with bags under eyes and harp, and the Widget settings menu now takes up a full page. You can also now set .webp files as your desktop background, so you don't need to convert these images ahead of time.\n\nYou can try these features out now if you enroll in the Windows Insider program. While you run the risk of unstable software by enrolling your PC here, the Release Preview Channel is much less risky than the Dev or Beta channels, since the Releaser Preview Channel issues updates that have gone through more testing.",

    "description": "Make sure your backup settings are good to go.",
    "fullText": "While Android has automated, built-in backups for plenty of data, including photos, apps, and settings, local files have been excluded. In order to ensure you don't lose PDFs, documents, and other files stored on your device, you have to manually upload or copy them to the cloud or another location. But that's changing, at least in part: the February Google Play Services update comes with a new feature that will copy and upload your Downloads folder to Google Drive.\n\nThis is a meaningful update to Android's backup system, but it has some limitations. Here's what to know before enabling it.\n\nAs Android Authority describes, the local file backup feature applies only to items in your Downloads folder. It will not cover your device's entire internal storage. The backup will go to Google Drive as a static copy, meaning that files will not be continuously synced, and if you make changes in one location, they won't be reflected in the other. Backups will likely take place occasionally, such as when your phone is idle, charging, and connected to wifi.\n\nAndroid handles videos and photos similarly with backups to Google Photos. Other device data, like your call and text history and system settings, are backed up to Google Drive.\n\nWhile automatic backups of local files are useful for anyone who doesn't already have a comprehensive backup plan (and if you don't, you should), they could potentially take up a significant amount of space in your Google Drive storage. If you keep lots of invoices, tickets, documents, or installers in your Downloads folder, you may want to be more selective about what you back up and where—especially if you already pay for extra Drive capacity and need it for other purposes.\n\nThankfully, file backups are disabled by default. To turn them on, go to Settings > Google Backup and select Downloads. You can also change your backup preferences for photos and videos and \"other device data\" from this menu. Note that this feature is expected to be rolled out gradually and may not be available on your device immediately.",

    "description": "Great: more stuff I'll lose.",
    "fullText": "The next generation of Meta's Display smart glasses might come with a smart watch. According to a report from The Information, Meta's watch, codenamed Malibu 2, could feature fitness tracking features and AI, but its real purpose is to replace the Display's neural band and act as controller for the smart glasses. If the reports are accurate, Meta Display smart glasses with a smart watch could be available in 2026.\n\nThere aren't any other details on the smart watch, so we don't know the price or what features it may have—but I'd be surprised if this rumor doesn't pan out eventually. Meta has discussed the idea of a smart watch before, and it makes sense: If you're going to have a wrist-controller for your glasses, why not give it smart watch features as well? Especially if a glasses-and-watch combo potentially gives users a reason to switch away from their Apple Watches.\n\nSpeaking of Apple, if the rumors about the company are true, Apple is pushing to release its own suite of AI-powered wearable devices. According to a report in Bloomberg, Apple could roll out smart glasses in early 2027. The company is also reportedly developing an AI-powered pendant that can \"be pinned to a shirt or worn as a necklace,\" as well as AirPods with expanded AI capabilities. The AirPods and pendant will be equipped with cameras designed to \"help the AI work\" as opposed to taking photos. Apple's smart glasses will reportedly not feature a display, but will feature a higher end camera and superior build quality to Meta's smart glasses. All of Apple's devices are reportedly designed to work with iPhones.\n\nNone of this is confirmed, of course. The closest Apple has come to announcing these plans is CEO Tim Cook mentioning “categories of products” enabled by artificial intelligence at an all-hands meeting. However, everything points to Meta and Apple betting that consumers want a collection of connected AI-wearables. Each company is taking a different approach to hooking users into their ecosystem. Apple seems to be betting on devices integrated with iPhones and controlled with the kind of camera-based tech that powers the Apple Vision Pro headset. Meta seems to be aiming at replacing phones with an in-glasses display, and a biometric control scheme that works with muscle movements, like the existing neural band.\n\nBoth Meta and Apple seem to be competing to go beyond a screen or smart glasses to become the next interface for your life—but do people want that? Are consumers excited enough by the prospect of always-available AI and tied-together devices to buy them? That's the big question, and the answer is anything but certain. Both Apple and Meta have made big bets on virtual reality, and, despite both companies' VR devices being excellent, neither seems to have captured the market in way these firms would have liked. So, as they say, stay tuned.",

    "description": "I sort of hoped Brain.fm was selling snake oil, but I liked it more than I expected to.",
    "fullText": "Sometimes a life hack works when I wish it didn't. I, for example, am vulnerable to depression and anxiety. I also passionately hate running. I have, unfortunately, discovered that running regularly helps my mental health a great deal. I'm thankful (because I feel better) and resentful (because I have to run).\n\nThis is how I feel about Brain.fm, a music service I discovered a couple weeks ago when the company got in touch with me. I started using the service, mostly for the purposes of writing this article, and something unexpected happened: I noticed it's a great deal easier to get started on my work in the morning. I like this (because I'm getting more done) but am also annoyed (because I'd rather be listening to the music I love).\n\nIt's a conundrum. Brain.fm is a subscription service that costs $14.99 per month, more than Spotify (which costs $12.99 per month). The product sells itself as having a collection of music backed by scientific research to increase your ability to focus, meditate, and sleep. There's also a free trial, meaning you can get a feel for whether it works for you.\n\nAfter a few weeks of testing, I feel it might be onto something. I don't always trust my intuition, though, so I wanted to dig deeper. Is this for real? Or am I falling for snake oil? More importantly: can I go back to listening to KEXP in the morning?\n\nAfter a few days of using the application, I couldn't help but wonder. Is my increased focus real? Or is it a placebo?\n\nSo I wrote to Daniel J. Levitin, professor emeritus of neurology at McGill University, and author of This Is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession. He replied quickly, and concisely: \"It's all placebo,\" he said.\n\nIt was a very concise email from an academic about a complex topic, which as a journalist is always nice. But Levitin didn't stop there—he told me to get in touch with another neuroscientist, one who had published research on this type of modulated music. I'll say more below about that research, but first, let's take a look at what's actually in those Brain.fm tracks.\n\nYou can't use this service to search for a specific artist—you instead let the application know what you're trying to do (Focus, Relax, Meditate, or Sleep). In the Focus section, there are a few sub-options: Deep Work, Motivation, Creativity, Learning, and Light Work. Choose what you want to do and a track will start playing.\n\nThe genres, such as they are, range from the kind of \"chill beats\" you can find on YouTube to post-rock and symphonic—though it's all instrumental.\n\n\"The basic problem is that most music is made to grab your attention,\" Kevin Woods, a neuroscience PhD who works for Brain.fm, told me. \"If you talk to a music producer, they'll tell you that their job is to make things punchy and bright, and to make somebody sit up and turn their head and favorite the song on Spotify.\"\n\nThat attention seeking can make playing music during the work day distracting in a subtle way, according to Woods. \"The problem is that a lot of the distraction is not overt in the sense of, 'I can feel my attention breaking and I have to turn this off or turn down the volume'—it's more like, 'I'm working at 70, 80% capacity, and I'm not really sure why.'\"\n\nSo the music at Brain.fm is written and performed by in-house composers who are intentionally trying not to keep your attention. But that alone doesn't really set Brain.fm apart from using ambient music or video game soundtracks to focus, let alone the various \"chill beats\" playlists and live streams that are out there. And that's where Brain.fm's scientific claims come in.\n\nBrain.fm points to several scientific studies on its homepage, also mentioning that its research was in part funded by that National Science Foundation. A lot of the claims are based on \"amplitude modulation,\" which Woods told me is what sets Brain.fm's music apart.\n\nBut what is amplitude modulation? They're \"fast modulations added that do not usually occur in music,\" according to Woods. If you listen to the music for a bit, you'll hear an almost fluttering kind of sound. These sounds, which are added to compositions in post-production using AI, are available at three different levels for each track. The \"ADHD Mode,\" which is the highest of the three settings, is what I mostly used while testing.\n\nI find this effect a little bit disorienting, so I sometimes needed to turn the setting down. It's hard to deny the effect is a musical signature of Brain.fm. But does it work?\n\nI became a bit less skeptical of the science after getting in touch with the expert that Levitin recommended: Psyche Loui, a neuroscientist, musician, and Associate Dean of Research at Northeastern University. Loui told me that \"it's not all placebo\", pointing to a paper she published alongside Woods and other neurologists in Communications Biology.\n\nNow, to be clear, it's not unusual for scientists to disagree about how things work—that's part of the process. And the claims made by the paper are narrow—the conclusion is that music with amplitude modulation can help people focus on tasks when compared to both pink noise and music without amplitude modulation. The control music, according to Woods, were the same tracks—the only difference was whether amplitude modulation was added. The results of testing, and brain scans, suggest the effect is real.\n\n\"We did something which is rarely done in music research, which is a very well-controlled study that only changes one factor in the music,\" Woods told me. As with all scientific research, there's always more to learn. But to me, a study making these claims published in a Nature-affiliated publication suggests there might be something to this.\n\nBrain.fm, if nothing else, has been an opportunity to reflect on my relationship with music. I really enjoy discovering new music during the workday, but after using Brain.fm for a few weeks I wonder if that might have been the reason I have trouble focusing in the morning.\n\nMaybe it's best to listen to music that fades into the background when it's time to focus, and save music discovery for when I only need part of my brain. And maybe I should save the music I really love for when I'm not working at all. Brain.fm, if nothing else, taught me that.\n\nBut I also find that the music really does work when I need to focus. I still am not fully sure if the effect is real, or if any music that blends into the background would do the job. I sometimes play the entire Boards of Canada discography when I need to focus, and find that works about as well.\n\nAll that having been said, I really think anyone who has read this much about Brain.fm should probably go ahead and see for themselves.",

    "fullText": "At half-time in Celtic's eventual 4-1 Europa League play-off defeat by Stuttgart, the focus was on home goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel.\n\n\"It looks to me as if he is not expecting shots, which is strange for a goalkeeper,\" former Scotland forward James McFadden said. \"He's expecting defenders to stop every shot.\n\n\"Teams will be saying there appears to be a weakness to his left-hand side.\"\n\nThe Denmark shot-stopper had been beaten down to his left by a tame Bilal El Khannouss shot for Stuttgart's opening goal, before the on-loan Leicester City man added a second with a free header from seven yards out.\n\nAnd at full-time, attention was on Schmeichel again.\n\nJamie Leweling's powerful strike from range - not in the bottom corner - went straight through the 39-year-old goalkeeper for the visitors' third.\n\nTiago Tomas added a fourth in the closing stages to compound a disappointing night for Celtic, who host Hibernian and go to Rangers in the Scottish Premiership, either side of next Thursday's unlikely salvage mission in Germany.\n\nSportsound: Celtic face Europa League exit\n\nWith fans protesting against the club's board at the start of the game and later ironically cheering Schmeichel making a save, the atmosphere at Parkhead was far from harmonious.\n\n\"It's bitterly disappointing,\" former Celtic captain and manager Neil Lennon said of the jeers directed at Schmeichel.\n\n\"He had a bad night but it still doesn't warrant that kind of treatment.\"\n\nThursday night was the latest in a string of perceived errors made by Schmeichel, following Joe Hugill's looping header for Kilmarnock last weekend and Jonathan Rowe's effort for Bologna last month.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Celtic closed ranks around their embattled goalkeeper post-match.\n\n\"It's a tough evening for us,\" interim manager Martin O'Neill said. \"On paper, 4-1 looks pretty poor.\n\n\"We were masters of our own downfall in many respects, conceded some poor goals.\n\n\"Kasper [Schmeichel] has made some great saves while I've been here. This is a collective, there's no doubt about that.\n\n\"We played Feyenoord in a game we probably had to win and he made an unbelievable save, otherwise we wouldn't be here playing tonight.\n\n\"I will think about all sorts of things [before the next game], but Kasper has done really well since I've arrived at the football club, in both spells.\"\n\nCaptain Callum McGregor added: \"Everyone makes mistakes.\n\n\"Kasper has been amazing since he's come to the club. He'll dust that down. We win as a team and lose as a team.\n\n\"There's no blame, he's made so many big saves for us. He'll bounce back for sure.\"\n\nCeltic endure punishing night at hands of ruthless Stuttgart\n\nCeltic given full Ibrox stand in Scottish Cup\n\nThere is evidence that - particularly in Europe - Schmeichel has underperformed this season.\n\nHe has conceded 19 goals in nine Europa League matches this term, with a save percentage of just 62.\n\nCeltic's expected goals on target conceded - the likelihood of an on-target shot resulting in a goal - is 13.96 across those games. In essence, Schmeichel has conceded four goals more than the data would expect him to.\n\nMcFadden thinks Celtic's season could go one way or another based on whether O'Neill decides to stick with Schmeichel or promote understudy Viljami Sinisalo.\n\n\"Does the season hinge on it? It might do because if Martin O'Neill opts to stick with Kasper Schmeichel, that's a big decision. If he opts to change him, that's a big decision.\n\n\"If you feel that's the decision to be made because you feel more secure at the back, then you make it.\"\n\nOne man who knows what it feels like to line up between the sticks at Parkhead is BBC Scotland pundit Pat Bonner, who thinks a change should be made.\n\n\"My opinion is that Sinisalo should have got a run in the team earlier this season,\" he said.\n\nDespite Schmeichel's mistakes, Lennon also questioned the way Celtic performed as a collective on a night when Stuttgart proved far too strong.\n\n\"Celtic lacked a lot of power and intensity, certainly in a defensive capacity,\" he said. \"It was far too easy, far too stand-offish.\n\n\"That is not a Martin O'Neill team or a Martin O'Neill performance.\n\n\"I cannot believe the lack of passion.\"\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "description": "Inside the Hungarian midfielder's season as the main character at Liverpool, his friendship with Mohamed Salah and why the Reds are keen to extend his contract.",
    "fullText": "On his forearm, Dominik Szoboszlai has a tattoo in Hungarian which reads 'Talent is a divine blessing, but without incredible will and humility, it is worth nothing'.\n\nDig a little deeper and you find the quote is attributed to Steven Gerrard.\n\nWhen midfielder Szobozslai arrived at Liverpool from RB Leipzig in 2023 for £60m, there was a reason why he took the number eight shirt that had become synonymous with Gerrard at Anfield.\n\nEarlier that summer, Alexis Mac Allister turned down the chance to take the number, but Szoboszlai craved that main-character energy.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been Liverpool's main character this season, scoring his 10th goal of the season last weekend, to go with seven assists.\n\nWhen it was put to him that he was having a \"Steven Gerrard season\", he politely disagreed and insisted he was writing his own story.\n\nOnly forward Hugo Ekitike has more goal involvements and captain Virgil van Dijk has played more minutes than Szoboszlai for Liverpool this season - and close friend Mohamed Salah described him as \"one of the best players in the world right now\".\n\nThe Hungary international may insist on being his own man, but when it comes to taking responsibility as others struggle, and having his own goal of the season competition at the club, there are certainly similarities to the iconic and inspirational Gerrard.\n\nSzoboszlai hasn't always played in his preferred number 10 position this season, but is scoring more frequently - his stunning free-kicks against Arsenal and Manchester City came in games he started at right-back. The step-up in both consistency and output has been clear.\n\nIn a tumultuous Liverpool campaign that has involved speculation about the future of Salah and defenders Ibrahima Konate and Andy Robertson, perhaps the most important negotiation will be with Szoboszlai, who has just over two years to run on the initial five-year deal signed in 2023.\n\nSpanish outlet Marca reported comments last week from Hungary boss Marco Rossi in which he said Szoboszlai's one dream was to play for Real Madrid. The club's Brazilian forward Vinicius Jr also named the Hungary captain as one of his closest friends outside Real.\n\nEncouragingly for Liverpool supporters, talks over a new contract have started, and Szoboszlai said earlier this month he loved the city and the club. His agent, Matyas Esterhazy, added this week on Hungarian TV the player was not looking for a move elsewhere.\n\nThose who see him on a daily basis at Liverpool describe him as highly competitive with a clear desire to excel.\n\nSzoboszlai is regularly among the first to arrive at training and it's no surprise he's high up in terms of the club's running and physical stats. No Liverpool player has covered more distance this season.\n\nIn a recent video on Liverpool's channels, Milos Kerkez - who plays with him for club and country - said Szoboszlai would be a 400m runner if he wasn't a footballer.\n\n\"He could jog from Liverpool to Hungary and not get tired,\" joked left-back Kerkez.\n\nSzoboszlai is a man determined in his own right, but Salah's high standards are understood to have a big influence on him. Away from football, the pair enjoy playing backgammon and often hang out together at each other's houses.\n\nWhen he was described as \"disrespectful\" last month by Barnsley boss Conor Hourihane for attempting a backheel in his own box that led to a mistake and goal for the League One side, Szoboszlai spoke up to defend himself.\n\nPrivately, manager Arne Slot had a word too.\n\nSzoboszlai's prime years are ahead of him. He was handed the national team captaincy at 22 and Liverpool view him as a future skipper, just like Gerrard.\n\nWith vice-captain Robertson expected to depart this summer and Van Dijk's deal expiring in 2027, the possibility is certainly there.\n\nAsked if Szoboszlai has the attributes to be a future leader, Slot said: \"Yes, but he is still young. He has a lot of attributes already, especially when it comes to leading by example. There is still a step to make in terms of leadership, being vocal and a voice in the dressing room if I compare him to Virgil, which is completely normal.\n\n\"Virgil is 34 and has seen [James] Milner, [Jordan] Henderson and these players, so it's really good for Dominik that he sees Virgil. That would be the next step for him; to be as vocal and as loud as Virgil but that comes wih time.\n\n\"But for all the other things, he has a lot to become a very influential player for Liverpool and you could call that a leader.\"\n\nDuring his first season at Liverpool which was Jurgen Klopp's last campaign, Szoboszlai struggled in a game at Luton, and his frustrations summed up when he booted a ball outside the stadium.\n\nSzoboszlai returned later that summer with a point to prove and has been ever-present under Slot since - 2025 was the year he became a husband, father and a Premier League winner.\n\nThis term, he has already played more minutes for Liverpool than he did in 2023-24 and only 302 minutes short of matching his tally for the previous campaign.\n\n\"Obviously he has been very good [this season],\" added Van Dijk. \"He's also a player who I think can still make the next step in terms of being a leader for this team. It starts by leading by example and that's something he has done so far this season.\n\n\"But also everything around it, there is still progress to be made and that's a good thing in my opinion, so hopefully he will be very important for the years to come at Liverpool.\"\n\nWhen Klopp signed Szoboszlai - who had impressed at Red Bull Salzburg before joining RB Leipzig in 2021 - he said: \"This is a signing for our present and also for our future.\"\n\nLiverpool will be keen to make sure that remains the case.\n\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Duhan van der Merwe's try-scoring X-factor makes him perfectly suited to return to the Scotland XV against Wales on Saturday, writes Tom English.",
    "fullText": "A little chastened, you suspect, by his omission in the opening rounds of the Six Nations - not to mention being left out for the All Blacks Test in the autumn - and more than a little determined to make amends for lost time and for all the tries he might have scored. Against England, of course.\n\nIn putting some of the band back together - Blair Kinghorn also returning to 15 - Gregor Townsend's intentions are pretty clear.\n\nWales are shipping so many tries that Van der Merwe must be licking his lips in anticipation.\n\nThis game, more than any other game, looks like it's made for what he has to offer. What's that? A nose for a try like no player who has ever played for Scotland before.\n\nA running game that would see him power through reinforced concrete if there was a five-pointer to be had on the other side. A distraction for opposition defences. A fear factor, too.\n\nKinghorn & Van der Merwe return for Scots in Wales\n\nCostelow and Hamer-Webb start for Wales v Scotland\n\nHe hasn't started in a big Test match since France last March. He wasn't in the 23 for the marquee game in the autumn against the All Blacks and was only on the bench for the other box office encounter against Argentina.\n\nThe Six Nations has passed him by. This has been the toughest period of his career.\n\nWhat has ailed the big man? Injury, to begin with. Then, a lack of confidence. Then, a Lions tour that saw him score more tries than anybody else while never threatening to make it into the Test squad, as he did in 2021.\n\nAfter that, more injury and more shortage of belief. Rivals sped past him - Kyle Steyn and Jamie Dobie.\n\nThe malaise at Edinburgh has been a problem. Not just for him but for Darcy Graham, too.\n\nBeing a classy wing for risk-averse Edinburgh is like being a Ferrari on the M8 in rush hour. Fat lot of good your engine is going to do you when you don't have open road.\n\nScotland Rugby Podcast: Can Scotland repeat England heroics?\n\nYou would never say he was a forgotten man, but his return to the team to face Wales on Saturday was a minor surprise. It makes perfect sense, but not many expected it.\n\nFor Scotland, a fresh, focused and eager to please Van der Merwe is surely a good thing. For Wales, probably not so much.\n\nHe's Scotland's record try-scorer with 35 in 52 games; a 6ft 5in curiosity.\n\nIn the unforgiving terrain of Test rugby he has scored 0.67 tries per international which, frankly, is bordering on the obscene.\n\nHe has scored seven Six Nations tries against England, more than anybody else until Huw Jones overtook him last weekend.\n\nHe scores at a faster rate in Test rugby than he does in club rugby, which goes back, in part, to the way Edinburgh play and, in other part, to the way Scotland play.\n\nFinn Russell, and his ability to manipulate defences before putting the ball in Van der Merwe's hands, has been the making of the wing. Offloads and cross-kicks, Russell has laid them on a plate for him. Van der Merwe is a different beast when Russell is calling the shots.\n\nHe has appeared on two Lions tours; he was second leading try-scorer in South Africa in 2021 and leading try-scorer in Australia in 2025. He got hat-tricks on both tours.\n\nRichard Cockerill, the coach who brought him to Edinburgh in the first place, has called him a freak, which he is.\n\nNobody could legitimately claim that Van der Merwe, for all his power and pace and lethal finishing ability, is the complete rugby player. Absolutely, he is not.\n\nHe may have come a long way since fetching-up at Edinburgh and failing his medical.\n\nHe has progressed thrillingly beyond the point where Cockerill used to close his eyes when the ball was in the air anywhere near him for fear that he'd drop it.\n\nHe's flawed, of course. But the upside? Historic amounts of it. Tries by the bucket load - easy run-ins and monstrous solo runs.\n\nGive him a yard of grass and, as an opposition, best start saying your prayers.\n\nHis appearances at the Principality have seen the worst and the best of him.\n\nIn 2022, in what was a dismal Scotland defeat, the abiding image of him was a negative one, a man coughing up ball and looking a bit weak amid a battle.\n\nTwo years later, he was a total menace.\n\nRussell the creator, Van der Merwe the finisher, from inside the Wales 22 for the first and from a mile out for the second, an arcing run that Wales saw coming but could do nothing to stop.\n\nThey'll see him again on Saturday. Some of those Welsh players might see him in their nightmares before Saturday.\n\nVan der Merwe might see this is a second chapter in his Scotland's story, one that some felt might have been slipping away from him amid the excellence of Steyn and Dobie.\n\nRugby's brutality, and Dobie's injury, has opened the door to him again and he's not the type to knock politely. His way has always been to take the thing off its hinges. Wales won't need any warning about the danger lurking out there on the left wing.",

    "fullText": "Plans to change the format of the Women's FA Cup, which would have seen four sides seeded and pathways to Wembley mapped out from the last 32 onwards, will not be introduced next season.\n\nThe proposals, first reported by the Guardian, external this month, would prevent the top four sides from the previous season's Women's Super League (WSL) meeting until the semi-finals and end the use of draws from the fourth round onwards.\n\nThe Football Association (FA) had claimed it would create \"high chances of consistent high-quality matches throughout the later rounds\" and \"strengthen commercial potential\".\n\nBut several official supporters' clubs warned the steps would ruin the \"magic\" of the competition and see the biggest clubs \"only get richer\".\n\nThe FA says it has listened to feedback and will hold off changing the cup's structure while it gathers more views.\n\nAn FA statement said: \"We understand how much the competition means to clubs, players and fans across the pyramid, and it is important that all parties have enough time to share their views.\n\n\"As a result, we will be extending the consultation phase to allow for further engagement informed by the questions and comments raised.\"\n\nSheGulls, representing fans of WSL club Brighton & Hove Albion, had suggested seeding \"elite level teams\" would only widen the gulf in quality across the game.\n\n\"The sporting merit in our game is slowly being eroded in favour of 'super matches' between elite level teams,\" the fan group wrote on X.\n\n\"The rich will only get richer and teams up and down the pyramid will fade into obscurity with the knowledge that without tens of millions of pounds, they won't even sniff the big time.\"\n\nFulham Women Supporters' Club, whose side play in the fourth tier, labelled it a \"ridiculous idea\" and added: \"[It] goes against all the principles of the FA Cup. I'd like to see WSL teams actually come in a round early.\"\n\n\"And there goes the magic of the FA Cup! Subway Cup [League Cup] is a farce, now this?\" added Everton Women's Official Supporters Club.\n\n\"All about the money. Didn't take long to ruin the women's game too did it…\"\n\nThe Women's FA Cup currently follows the same format as the men's competition, with a draw following each round.\n\nThere is a preliminary round and three qualifying rounds featuring teams from tiers four to seven of the pyramid, with Women's National League teams entering in the first-round proper, WSL2 teams in the third round and sides from the top division a round later.\n\nThe proposals came to light less than a fortnight after a major revamp of the Women's League Cup was announced, with the competition set to get a new name and follow the format of the Champions League from the group stage next season.\n\n'Women's FA Cup revamp would ruin the magic'\n\nWomen's League Cup to undergo name and format changes\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "fullText": "British freestyle skier Zoe Atkin qualified top for Saturday's halfpipe final as she looks to add the Winter Olympic title to her World Championship crown.\n\nThe 23-year-old, also a two-time X Games champion, put down a best score of 91.50 on her first run.\n\nAtkin is the younger sister of Izzy Atkin, who won Great Britain's first Olympic medal on skis with her slopestyle bronze in 2018.\n\nChina's defending champion Eileen Gu - expected to be the main rival for the gold - qualified in fifth with a score of 86.50, having crashed on her first run.\n\n\"It feels so good,\" Atkin told BBC Sport. \"Obviously, I was pretty nervous coming into today.\n\n\"A big event and qualifying can be more nerve-wracking than finals as you only have two runs to put it down.\n\n\"I'm really happy that I was able to manage those feelings. I'm in a good standing for Saturday and that brings me a lot of confidence, so I am super excited.\"\n\nBorn and raised in the United States to a British father and a Malaysian mother, Atkin has competed for Great Britain her entire career and made an Olympic debut four years ago.\n\nWith her sister and family watching on at Livigno Snow Park, she put in an assured performance to start her Olympic campaign, impressing the judges with the height of her tricks above the 6.7m-high pipe.\n\nCanada's Cassie Sharpe, the 2018 Olympic champion and 2022 silver medallist, qualified third after her first run, but was taken away on a stretcher after a heavy crash on her second.\n\n\"It is nerve-wracking, but it is also nice as you get to see what everyone is doing, so you can strategise a little bit,\" she added.\n\n\"It gives me confidence to know the judges like my skiing, and they're hyped to see what I bring to the finals. I am confident and feeling excited.\n\n\"The pipe is amazing. It is definitely a steep pitch, so it allows for a lot of speed, which is kind of one of my things to go big.\"\n\nHeavy snow fell on Livigno throughout Thursday, causing the men's halfpipe qualifiers to be postponed.\n\nThey will now take place on Friday morning from 09:30 GMT, with Gus Kenworthy and Liam Richards competing for Great Britain.\n\nEileen Gu - the 'snow princess' who divides opinion\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "American superstar Alysa Liu added Olympic figure skating gold to her world title as she beat a standout field in the women's final.\n\nLiu came into the free skate in third place following a couple of errors in the short program, but produced a performance for the ages.\n\nAppropriately wearing a sparkly gold dress and performing to Donna Summer, she scored a staggering 150.20 in her free skate.\n\nIt pushed her to the top of the leaderboard with an overall score of 226.79, narrowly beating Japan's Kaori Sakamoto - who Liu beat to the world title last year.\n\nSakamoto, in her final performance before retirement, won silver with 17-year-old compatriot Ami Nakai claiming bronze.\n\nJapan's Mone Chiba finished fourth, ahead of Amber Glenn - who rose from 13th to fifth after an excellent free skate - while Russian champion Adeliia Petrosian came sixth following a fall.\n\nLiu, 20, becomes the first American Olympic champion in women's figure skating since Sarah Hughes in 2002, and the first USA medallist since Sasha Cohen in 2006.\n\nShe was playing catch up on Nakai - leader after the short program - and Sakamoto after Tuesday night following a mistake on her triple lutz where she failed to fully rotate in the element.\n\nBut there were no mistakes here with a truly showstopping routine that drew deafening cheers from the crowd.\n\nIt was a much needed boost for the USA, as their only gold in singles figure skating following Ilia Malinin's collapse in the men's event.\n\nMalinin was among those in the crowd who gave Liu - the alt girl with her iconic halo hair and lip piercing - a standing ovation as she wrote herself into Olympic folklore.\n\nIt completes a remarkable comeback for Liu, who previously quit the sport aged 16 after missing out on a medal at Beijing 2022.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nSakamoto meanwhile has to settle for silver as her stellar career ends without an Olympic crown.\n\nShe is retiring aged 25 having won three world titles and bronze at Beijing 2022.\n\nHer final performance here was to Non, je ne regrette rien by Edith Piaf, and Sakamoto must have no regrets about a performance in which all 12 elements were given positive grades of execution.\n\nBut it scored five points lower than Liu in the technical elements, with the American's routine judged to have been more challenging.\n\nSakamoto wept as she left the ice, but by the medal ceremony rightly looked delighted with another major honour.\n\nThat initial disappointment was in stark contrast to the joy of compatriot Nakai, who ends a phenomenal debut campaign with an Olympic medal.\n\nThe youngest skater in the competition, Nakai stormed to the top of the leaderboard following the short program and opened her free skate with a triple axel - a brutally tough element she is now making her trademark.\n\nBut Nakai stumbled on her triple lutz, which played a major role in knocking her down below Liu and Sakamoto.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nFor a while, it looked like American champion Glenn might have produced an all-time great Olympic comeback.\n\nShe was down in 13th following a disastrous short program which left her in tears after she missed her triple loop, meaning it was scored zero as an invalid element.\n\nGlenn - who is open about her bisexuality and criticism of USA president Donald Trump - has been a magnet for online backlash, and came out on Thursday in Milan with a point to prove.\n\nDespite suffering a heavy fall in the warm-up she attacked her free skate, including a triple axel to start then a complex triple loop and double axel sequence.\n\nShe punched the air at the conclusion, and even as she missed out on a medal she had the body language of someone pleased to have brought her best to the Olympic stage.\n\nThe same could not be said for Petrosian, who was aiming to be the second Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN) of the day to win a medal at Milan-Cortina 2026.\n\nThe teenager is under the tutelage of controversial Eteri Tutberidze - the coach of Kamila Valieva at the last Olympics - who was rinkside during Petrosian's pre-skate.\n\nBut the 18-year-old's medal hopes were all but dashed on her first routine as she attempted a quad toe loop but fell.\n\nIf she had nailed her complex routine, gold was likely. But instead Petrosian was left stony faced, and she exited the stage quickly when it was confirmed she had missed the podium.",

    "description": "Eileen Gu is the most decorated female Olympic freestyle skier in history, and a global superstar, but continues to divide opinion.",
    "fullText": "Wherever Eileen Gu goes, her fans will follow. Headlines will too.\n\nWith five medals - and the opportunity for one more on Saturday - she is the most decorated female Olympic freestyle skier in history.\n\nBut she is also someone who transcends her sport, a 22-year-old global superstar with a bank balance to make your eyes water.\n\nChina fell in love with its 'snow princess' at the Beijing 2022 Olympics where, as the poster girl of the Games, she duly delivered.\n\nShe became freestyle skiing's youngest Olympic champion with her big air and halfpipe golds at the age of 18, and the first to win three medals at the same Games when she added slopestyle silver.\n\nLater that year, she was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world.\n\n\"I just like being the best. I've always wanted to do that,\" said Gu at the Milan-Cortina Olympics, where she has added two more silver medals to her Olympic collection.\n\n\"I wanted to be the best at math when I was in kindergarten, and then I wanted to get into the best high school, and I wanted to have the highest SAT score, and then I wanted to get to the best college, and I wanted to be the best skier I could be.\n\n\"Then I wanted to do every event, and then I wanted to win them all. When you get a taste of it, it's kind of addictive.\"\n\nThe two Chinese-American Olympians competing for rival superpowers\n\nOn and off skis, Gu is a high achiever in every part of her world.\n\nCalifornia-born and raised by an American father and Chinese mother, she attended private school in San Francisco and is currently taking a sabbatical from her studies at Stanford University, where she majors in international relations and previously studied quantum physics.\n\nShe is also fluent in Mandarin, and as a child would spend summers in Beijing.\n\n\"Sometimes it feels like I'm carrying the weight of two countries on my shoulders,\" Gu said earlier in the 2026 Games.\n\nIn 2019, at the age of just 15, she switched her sporting allegiance from the US to China, wanting to \"inspire millions of young people in Beijing - my mother's birthplace\" before the 2022 Olympics.\n\nWhatever her reasoning, it was a decision that proved lucrative.\n\nIn December, Forbes ranked Gu as the fourth-highest paid female athlete for 2025, behind only tennis players Coco Gauff, Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek.\n\nBut unlike those three, only a tiny amount of her $23.1m (£17.1m) income last year came from prize money from her sport - around $100,000 (£74,000).\n\nInstead, it comes through endorsements with brands such as Red Bull, Porsche and Tiffany & Co, while she has walked the runway for Louis Vuitton and Victoria's Secret and is signed by modelling agency IMG.\n\nIt also emerged in 2025, as reported in the Wall Street Journal, external, that Gu and another athlete were set to be paid a combined $6.6m (£4.9m) by the Beijing Municipal Sports Bureau.\n\nIn total, the two athletes were said to be paid nearly $14m (£10.4m) over the past three years by the Bureau.\n\nBut her decision to compete for China was also one that drew much criticism, not just because of China and the US' rivalry as the world's two biggest economies, but because of China's authoritarian Communist Party rulers and its poor record on human rights - which it denies.\n\nWhile the initial furore died down, it has raised its head again at these Games.\n\nAt the start of the Olympics, American freestyle skier Hunter Hess spoke out about the actions of the United States' Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) organisation and ongoing tensions in the US.\n\nIn January, intensive care nurse Alex Pretti, 37, and fellow Minnesota resident Renee Good, 37, were both killed by ICE agents in the city, sparking widespread protests.\n\nAsked what it means to represent the USA, Hess said: \"It's a little hard.\n\n\"Just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the US.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump responded to Hess' comment by calling him a \"real loser\", and Gu was one of several athletes who publicly defended Hess and others speaking out.\n\n\"As someone who's been caught in the crossfire before, I feel sorry for the athletes,\" she said.\n\nBut that enraged her critics, given Gu chose to speak out against Trump but has never criticised China.\n\nFormer NBA player Enes Kanter Freedom called her a \"traitor\", adding she \"was born in America, raised in America, lives in America and chose to compete against her own country for the worst human rights abuser on the planet - China\".\n\n\"You don't get to enjoy the freedoms of US citizenship while acting as a global PR asset for the Chinese Communist Party,\" he wrote on X.\n\nWhen asked about China's human rights record by Time magazine, external, in an interview published in January, she answered: \"I'm not an expert on this.\n\n\"I haven't done the research. I don't think it's my business.\"\n\nGu has 2.6m followers on Instagram, has amassed 11.7m likes on TikTok, and at the Livigno Snow Park high up in the Italian Alps, no athlete has more fans in attendance.\n\nClad in the red colours of China, they line the front of the fan areas, flags adorned with images of Gu's face pegged to the fences, and celebrate her every run like it has clinched Olympic gold.\n\nAfter every run, the ever-driven and disciplined Gu seeks out her mother, Yan, to review video footage on her phone. Yan, reportedly a successful venture capitalist who brought her daughter up single-handledly, is accredited at the Games and is the first person Gu celebrates her successes with.\n\nDuring Monday's big air final, Yan was seen watching alongside former International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach.\n\nAfter competitions, Gu is the one every media outlet wants to speak to, and she gracefully and politely obliges as she slowly shuffles through the mixed zone.\n\nBut it was from a press conference earlier this week that her remarks to a journalist went viral, when she was asked if she felt her two silver medals were actually two golds lost.\n\n\"I'm the most decorated female freeskier in history. I think that's an answer in and of itself,\" she replied.\n\n\"How do I say this? Winning a medal at the Olympics is a life-changing experience for every athlete. Doing it five times is exponentially harder because every medal is equally hard for me but everybody else's expectations rise, right?\n\n\"So the two medals lost situation, to be quite frank with you, I think is kind of a ridiculous perspective to take.\n\n\"I'm showcasing my best skiing, I'm doing things that quite literally have never been done before so I think that is more than good enough. But thank you.\"\n\nIn the lead-up to the Games, Gu did interviews with the likes of Vogue and Time magazine, but it was reports in the Swiss media, external that had the potential to further fuel a competitive rivalry at the top of the sport.\n\nIt was reported that the coach of Swiss skier Mathilde Gremaud left her team to join Gu's on the eve of the Games, just as he had four years earlier before Beijing 2022.\n\nAt those Games, Gremaud pipped Gu to slopestyle gold, while Gu won the big air title with Gremaud taking bronze.\n\nThis time around, Gremaud again won slopestyle gold, with Gu taking silver, while the Swiss star withdrew from the big air after a crash, with Gu going on to finish second again.\n\nBefore that big air final and as a result of reaching it, Gu had taken to Instagram to highlight a scheduling issue.\n\nIt meant, as the only woman competing in three freeski events, she would miss a full day of halfpipe training. After appealing to the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) for another opportunity to train, she said she had been turned down.\n\n\"This decision is disappointing to me because it seems to contradict the spirit of the Games,\" she said.\n\n\"Daring to be the only woman to compete in three events should not be penalised. Making finals in one event should not disadvantage me in another.\"\n\nBBC Sport understands Gu had already been handpicked as one of 10 athletes - five men, five women - invited to a halfpipe testing training session, while having three official training sessions is more than the usual two held before World Cups.\n\nIn a statement, FIS told BBC Sport: \"For athletes who choose to compete in multiple disciplines and/or multiple events, conflicts can sometimes be inevitable.\"\n\nSo serious is Gu taking these Olympics that she has brought 21 pairs of skis with her to Livigno, seven per event. Asked by BBC Sport how many she would normally take to a competition, she replied two or three.\n\nIn the halfpipe training she did do she looked in imperious form, and qualified for Saturday's final in fifth place, with Great Britain's Zoe Atkin, also a Stanford student, topping the standings.\n\n\"My sixth Olympic final. I am proud to have a 100% success rate,\" Gu told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It is not an easy thing to do. The Olympics brings out the best and worst in people.\n\n\"Being able to withstand that pressure is something I am really proud of.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Ukraine's Winter Paralympics team will boycott the event's opening ceremony next month after Russian and Belarusian athletes were invited to compete under their national flags.\n\nOn Tuesday, it was announced six Russian and four Belarusian athletes will take part in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing and snowboarding at the Milan-Cortina Games, which start on 6 March.\n\nBoth countries had previously been suspended from Paralympic competition after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with Belarus an ally of Russia.\n\nIn September, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) lifted its ban on athletes from the two countries competing at the Games.\n\nHowever, the IPC does not govern the six sports contested at the Paralympics and despite the individual bodies, including the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS), refusing to lift their own bans, Russia and Belarus won an appeal to the Court of Arbitration of Sport against FIS.\n\nAs a result, athletes have been able to return to FIS competitions and the 10 Paralympians have been awarded bipartite commission invitations to compete in Italy.\n\nFollowing an announcement that Ukrainian officials would avoid the entire competition, the country's National Paralympic Committee now says team members will miss the opening ceremony.\n\nThe organisation has also made a \"demand that the Ukrainian flag not be used\".\n\nThe team will still compete in the Games and \"fight for the sporting victories of Ukrainian athletes\".\n\nEarlier this week in its response to criticism over the decision to allow the Russian and Belarussian athletes to compete, the IPC said it was a \"democratic organisation and the decision to lift the partial suspension of NPCs Belarus and Russia was taken by IPC member organisations at the 2025 General Assembly\".\n\nIt added: \"At this meeting nearly 180 of the IPC's 211 members were in attendance and voted on this matter. We have to respect the decision of our members who come from all over the world.\"\n\nIn its statement announcing the boycott, the National Paralympic Committee of Ukraine described the IPC's decision as \"shameful\" and that it \"completely contradicts the principles\" of the Games.\n\nBipartite commission invites are granted to individual athletes, rather than their international federation, and allow the participation of top athletes \"who may not have had the opportunity to qualify through other methods due to extraordinary circumstances\".\n\nThe IPC, with the support of international federations - in this case FIS - decides who receives the bipartite slots after receiving recommendations from the federation.\n\nUkraine has also been awarded bipartite slots in three sports.",

    "fullText": "Formula 1 boss Stefano Domenicali has called for calm in the face of criticism from drivers of the sport's new rules - but said changes would be made if necessary.\n\nF1's four active world champions - Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen, Fernando Alonso and Lando Norris - have all made disparaging comments about the driving experience of the new cars in one way or another.\n\nBut Domenicali said in a news conference on Thursday: \"We need to avoid overreaction because it's just the beginning of a new journey, so that's why I say we need to stay calm.\n\n\"And if there is something that is useful and can be implemented straight away, I've seen a very open approach by [governing body] the FIA and also the teams sharing their defined data of course with the others.\n\n\"It's a new concept where it has to be, of course, improved if needed.\"\n\nNorris admits new F1 cars 'not purest form of racing'\n\n'Just not F1' or 'a lot of fun'? New cars split drivers\n\nThe biggest rule change in F1 history has seen cars, engines and tyres all subject to change this year, in addition to the introduction of carbon-neutral sustainable fuels.\n\nDrivers have targeted the new engines, which require substantial energy management at all times for optimum performance.\n\nVerstappen said F1 was now \"like Formula E on steroids\", while Alonso added \"the chef could drive the car\" at the speed he was going around some fast corners to harvest energy, and Hamilton claimed the new rules were \"ridiculously complex\".\n\nBriton Norris, who initially defended the cars last week as \"fun\", said on Thursday he had made those comments to see the reaction and admitted they were \"certainly not the purest form of racing\".\n\nDomenicali, the president and chief executive officer of commercial rights holder F1, pointed out the new engine rules were conceived as an attempt to attract new engine manufacturers and had succeeded in attracting Audi and Cadillac, and persuaded Honda to reverse a decision to leave.\n\n\"The evolution of that is natural and will become normal,\" said the Italian. \"I am pretty confident this will evolve in a situation that, at the end of the year, no-one will remember what we are talking about today.\n\n\"We don't have to forget that, with all respect to all these technicalities we are taking about, it is something in the inner business of F1. [For] our 900 million fans, it is not in their business.\n\n\"What has to be protected is having great racing, great overtaking opportunities, great challenge to the drivers to show they are best. If these points are not taken, we need to intervene and restart immediately.\"\n\nDomenicali added he had been out on the track in pre-season testing in Bahrain on Thursday to see the cars for himself.\n\n\"The cars are really beautiful, the sound is very nice and if you go around the track here it seems that there is the car like it was last year and that's very important for the one that are very specific technical details to understand,\" he said.\n\nF1's bosses agreed at a meeting of the F1 Commission rules-making body on Wednesday they would assess data from this final test at a further meeting to decide whether action needed to be taken in the short term.\n\nConcern arises from the fact the new engine rules have tripled the power provided by the electrical part of the engine but left the batteries more or less the same size as last year, and removed one of the devices used to recover energy.\n\nThis had led to cars that are energy starved and forced the teams to find new ways to harvest sufficient electrical energy to produce the best performance. The rules governing energy recovery are also highly complex.\n\nThat in turn has required drivers to perform behaviours that have been described as \"counter-intuitive\" to optimise lap time.\n\nThese include not going flat out put of the final corner before a qualifying lap, lifting and coasting on a qualifying lap, and even not accelerating at full power at the end of a lap because it was more advantageous to use the energy elsewhere.\n\nHowever, drivers have generally been positive on the handling characteristics of the new cars, and a number of top drivers all told BBC Sport they are still driving to the limit of grip, and driver ability will still be as crucial as ever.\n\nDomenicali said: \"Don't be worried about the energy management. We're going to solve that. If we need to solve it, by the way.\"\n\nHe has spent his time in Bahrain having a series of discussions with individual drivers about the sport, including Verstappen.\n\nAnd he added: \"Max wants and does care about Formula 1 more than anyone else. He has a way of putting the point that he wants to say in a certain way.\n\n\"Max will be part of the future of Formula 1 and of course it's very important that we listen to him and all the top drivers that are very important in this sport.\"\n\nDomenicali also said F1 was looking at introducing new sporting elements on Fridays, expanding on the approach that led to sprint-race weekends, which feature two qualifying sessions rather than one, and a shorter race on the Saturday in addition to the grand prix on Sunday.\n\nHe has already previously said F1 is considering increasing the number of sprint events beyond the current six.\n\nDomenicali added: \"Feedback from the fans, from the people attending the track, the promoter, [is] that people want to see action, real action during the three days.\n\n\"People want to see already on Friday something that is sporting - qualifying, points, whatever it is.\n\n\"So, it is true that there is the trend to go in the direction of, even if it is not a sprint every weekend.\"",

    "fullText": "Vitor Pereira asked his Nottingham Forest players to \"express themselves\" prior to their commanding victory at Fenerbahce in the first leg of their Europa League knockout round play-off tie.\n\nIt could not have gone much better for the Portuguese in his first game in charge of the club, who recorded their biggest ever win away from home in European competition.\n\nGoals from Murillo, Igor Jesus and captain Morgan Gibbs-White underpinned a dominant Forest performance that could arguably have delivered an even more emphatic winning margin.\n\nPereira told TNT Sports: \"We had chance to score two more goals. It was a very good result. It is only half-time, we need to be consistent, the schedule is tight and difficult.\n\n\"Everyone must be ready to help the team. This is what I ask them.\n\n\"I realised before I came that the players have a lot of quality. They need results but they need to enjoy the game.\n\n\"If they enjoy the way they are playing they can have a high level. They need organisation and confidence. I asked them to express themselves on the pitch. They did it.\"\n\nSitting fourth bottom in the Premier League, just three points above the relegation zone, Forest's main aim is to stay up.\n\nHowever, extending their first European campaign since 1995-96 would also boost confidence at club that twice won the European Cup under Brian Clough.\n\nAnd Forest, who host Fenerbahce in the second leg at the City Ground on Thursday, 26 February (20:00 GMT), are now strong favourites to reach the last 16 where they will face either Midtjylland or Real Betis.\n\nPereira's perfect start as Forest thump Fenerbahce\n\n'We created fire' - Forest boss back with Marinakis\n\nOne of the biggest issues for Forest this term is Pereira is now their fourth manager, with Nuno Espirito Santo, Ange Postecoglou and Sean Dyche favouring different styles of play during their spells.\n\nHowever, captain Morgan Gibbs-White, said the players had little trouble adapting to 57-year-old Pereira's demands.\n\n\"I felt we had a real identity out there. We defended well and we created so many chances,\" said the England midfielder.\n\n\"His message to us is that we will have a real identity how we play and defend as a team. We have all bought into what he wants straight away.\n\n\"It is about learning off each other and taking it game by game. We needed a clean sheet and we needed a win and today felt like the perfect moment.\n\n\"We have been going through a difficult time, confidence is the main thing and tonight will boost confidence. We just have to stay together and be the most complete team.\"\n\nLatest Nottingham Forest news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Nottingham Forest - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Keely Hodgkinson smashes the long-standing women's indoor 800m world record set by Slovenia's Jolanda Ceplak on the day the Briton was born in 2002.",
    "fullText": "Keely Hodgkinson has broken the long-standing women's indoor 800m world record, set by Slovenia's Jolanda Ceplak on the day the Briton was born almost 24 years ago.\n\nOlympic champion Hodgkinson crossed the line in one minute 54.87 seconds in Lievin, France, taking almost one second off Ceplak's time of 1:55.82 which had endured since 3 March 2002.\n\n\"Thank god. That was really fun, I was really looking forward to this,\" Hodgkinson told the crowd, before being adorned with a golden crown as she took her place on a throne beside the track.\n\nThe 23-year-old, who broke the rarely contested 600m record during her previous indoor season three years ago, joins triple jumper Jonathan Edwards as the only British athlete to hold a current world record in one of the sport's championship events.\n\nHodgkinson was primed to target the indoor 800m record at her eponymous Keely Klassic event in February last year, before her ambitions were ruined by the first of two serious hamstring injuries that season.\n\nSpeaking before Thursday's event, Hodgkinson said that Lievin was not just about the world record \"but seeing how fast we can really go\", after bettering her own national record by almost one second at the UK Indoor Championships on Saturday.\n\nJoined on the start line by Ethiopia's Olympic silver medallist Tsige Duguma and Switzerland's Audrey Werro, who Hodgkinson replaced as the fastest woman this year, Poland's Anna Gryc was tasked with setting a pace of 55.8 seconds through halfway.\n\nAhead of schedule after a 55.56-second first 400m, Hodgkinson strode off the front and never appeared in danger of losing touch with the green wavelights representing the record time on the inside of the track.\n\nAfter the desperate lows of her first year as the reigning Olympic champion, Hodgkinson has come out firing in her second.\n\nThe world record appeared to be on borrowed time after Hodgkinson opened her season with a 1:56.33 clocking in Birmingham five days ago.\n\nShe made no secret of her ambition to surpass Ceplak's mark on a notoriously fast track in Lievin following that statement performance, saying: \"I feel like it is my record to break.\"\n\nIt left Ceplak and Austrian Stephanie Graf, who set her best time in finishing runner-up to Ceplak's world record run in Vienna, as the only athletes ahead of Hodgkinson on the all-time list.\n\nThat mark had remained a controversial one ever since Ceplak, and indeed Graf, later served two-year doping bans.\n\nBut, 12 days short of her birthday, and the latest anniversary of Ceplak's record, Hodgkinson took down the record to which she has long attached a sense of destiny.\n\nHodgkinson became known as 'Keely 2.0' among her M11 training group, such were the developments she made in strength and power during her time spent in the gym recovering from two hamstring tears in 2025.\n\nThose significant setbacks, though challenging both physically and emotionally, did not prevent her from making the world podium in September following a 376-day wait to race as Olympic champion.\n\nWith an uninterrupted winter training block behind her - the \"healthiest\" she says she has had \"in a long time\" - Hodgkinson signalled in devastating fashion that she is ready to make up for lost time.\n\nAfter she won BBC Sport's Personality of the Year following her crowning moment at Paris 2024, Jenny Meadows, co-coach of the M11 training group alongside husband Trevor Painter, said an attempt at the sport's oldest world record would naturally follow once the indoor best was captured.\n\nIt is close to 43 years since Czech athlete Jarmila Kratochvilova set the outright world 800m record by running 1:53.28 in July 1983.\n\nOn this evidence, it may not be long before Hodgkinson, who has world indoor, European and Commonwealth honours to target this year, writes further history.\n\n\"She's absolutely obliterated that world record... What better way to head on to the world indoors,\" British former 400m athlete Allison Curbishley said on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"A world indoor medal has eluded Keely in the last five years, so it's something she's desperate to get in Poland in a few weeks' time.\"\n\nRenee adds to Regis legacy with first UK title\n\nHodgkinson eyes world record after breaking British mark",

    "fullText": "When will AI movies start showing up in theaters nationwide?\n\nIt was supposed to be next month.\n\nBut when word leaked online that an AI short film contest winner was going to start screening before feature presentations in AMC Theatres, the cinema chain decided not to run the content.\n\nThe issue began earlier this week with the inaugural Frame Forward AI Animated Film Festival announcing Igor Alferov’s short film Thanksgiving Day had won the contest. The prize package for included Thanksgiving Day getting a national two-week run in theaters nationwide. When word of this began hitting social media, however, some were dismayed by the prospect of exhibitors embracing AI content, with many singling out AMC Theatres for criticism.\n\nExcept the short is not actually programmed by exhibitors, exactly, but by Screenvision Media — a third-party company which manages the 20-minute, advertising-driven pre-show before a theater’s lights go down. Screenvision — which co-organized the festival along with Modern Uprising Studios — provides content to multiple theatrical chains, not just AMC.\n\nAfter The Hollywood Reporter reached out to AMC about the brewing controversy, the company issued this statement to THR on Thursday: “This content is an initiative from Screenvision Media, which manages pre-show advertising for several movie theatre chains in the United States and runs in fewer than 30 percent of AMC’s U.S. locations. AMC was not involved in the creation of the content or the initiative and has informed Screenvision that AMC locations will not participate.”\n\nIt’s not yet clear if other theatrical chains will screen the short instead. Screenvision Media had no immediate comment, but the Frame Forward AI Animated Film Festival issued a statement from co-organizer MUS’s president and studio head Joel Roodman.\n\n“The national theatrical run, while truncated, is only an initial prize exposure for the winning film,” he said. “The film will be adapted for Celeste’s Massive Immersive theatrical venues, the first of which will be built in New York within the year. Shared theatrical experiences are an important cultural bond. The traditional theatrical chains are vital to our cohesion as a society, and are duly cautious [about AI]. However, the media landscape is changing and evolving rapidly. They may be prudent, but it is important to MUS immersive that new and exciting films, filmmakers, cinematic language, and spaces for these shared experiences continue to develop. We will bring new content, and important existing content, to our developing venue network of venues, starting in New York. We will not see the theatrical window wither on our watch.”\n\nThe film wouldn’t represent the first time AI content has played in theaters — a collection of film festival AI shorts from Runway’s 2025 AI Film Festival played in 10 Imax theaters in August. But this would likely be the first time a narrative AI film received nationwide exposure in cinemas rather than specialty screenings, and could represent another step in the groundbreaking technology marching into traditional Hollywood spaces.\n\nThe Thanksgiving Day film “follows a bear and his platypus assistant who are traveling through the galaxy in a spacecraft that looks like a dumpster. They have to deal with corrupt space-cops, hygiene officials, and a very unusual type of food delivery service as the story unfolds.”\n\nAccording to Deadline, Kazakhstani filmmaker Alferov used AI tools including Gemini 3.1 and Nano Banana Pro to make the short. Roodman said, “Thanksgiving Day is a masterclass in original storytelling, a wildly inventive journey that balances sharp satire with unexpected emotional payoff, proving that bold imagination with the tools of AI complements the future of animated filmmaking.”",

    "title": "Why Most AI Agent Directories Are Basically Useless",
    "description": "Let's be honest—most AI agent directories are just glorified link farms with the same 50 tools copy-pasted across them. Here's why that sucks, and what actually makes a directory worth your time.",
    "fullText": "Look. I've spent the last three months building AgentRank, and before that I wasted way too many hours scrolling through AI directories that all blur together into the same useless mess.\n\nYou know the ones. Pages and pages of logos, vague descriptions like \"AI-powered productivity tool,\" pricing that's always \"Contact for quote,\" and zero actual insight into whether the thing works or will waste your afternoon.\n\nIt's exhausting. And honestly? Kind of insulting.\n\nHere's what drives me nuts about 99% of AI agent directories out there:\n\nSeriously. Open three different \"AI tool directories\" and you'll see the exact same agents listed in almost the exact same order. ChatGPT, Claude, Jasper, Copy.ai. Cool. I could've Googled that.\n\nNobody's actually using half these tools. They're just scraping ProductHunt, slapping together a list, and calling it a day.\n\n2. The descriptions are worthless\n\n\"Revolutionizes workflows.\" \"Supercharges productivity.\" \"AI-powered innovation.\"\n\nGreat. What does it do? Can it write emails? Schedule meetings? Help me fix my leaky faucet? The marketing copy tells me nothing.\n\nI don't need your hype. I need to know if this tool solves my actual problem before I waste 20 minutes signing up and realizing it's useless.\n\nEvery listing is a press release. Five-star everything. \"Amazing!\" \"Game-changer!\" \"Must-have!\"\n\nZero honesty about what sucks. Zero comparison to alternatives. Zero \"this is great IF you need X, but terrible if you need Y.\"\n\nIf you're listing every tool as perfect, you're not helping me choose. You're just trying to collect affiliate fees.\n\nOh cool, another directory where everything is filed under \"productivity\" or \"AI assistant.\" Super helpful.\n\nI don't care that something is an \"AI agent.\" I care if it writes cold emails, debugs my code, or helps me find home repair contractors. Generic buckets don't cut it.\n\nHalf the listings are for tools that shut down six months ago or got acquired and nuked. Nobody's maintaining these directories. They're SEO graveyard.\n\nClick a link. Dead. Try another. 404. Great use of my time.\n\nHere's the thing—I'm not building AgentRank to be yet another link farm. I'm building it because I got fed up with the garbage out there.\n\nSo what makes a directory worth using? Here's my take:\n\nWhen I list a tool, I'm telling you what it's good at and where it falls short. Fixy's great for home repair DIY, but it's only on iOS right now. Claude's better for coding than ChatGPT, but costs more.\n\nHonesty. Specific use cases. Tradeoffs.\n\nIf I haven't actually used a tool, I'm not listing it.\n\n\"AI writing assistant\" doesn't help me. What I need to know is: Jasper vs Copy.ai for blog posts—which one gives me fewer robotic sounding paragraphs?\n\nReal comparisons based on actual use. Not feature charts, but \"here's when you'd pick A over B.\"\n\nI'm not filing Fixy under \"productivity.\" It goes under \"home improvement.\" Because that's what you'd search for when your toilet's running and you're trying to figure out if you can fix it yourself.\n\nContext matters. Use cases matter.\n\nDead tools get archived, not left to rot. Pricing is updated. Screenshots are recent. If something changed, the listing reflects it.\n\nNobody wants to waste time on outdated garbage.\n\nI'm not listing every AI tool that exists. If I wouldn't use it or recommend it, it's not going on AgentRank.\n\nThis started because I kept Googling \"best AI agent for X\" and getting the same recycled lists. Nothing useful. Nothing honest.\n\nSo I'm building the directory I wish existed:\n\nHonest takes on what's good and what sucks\n\nReal-world use cases, not buzzwords\n\nWill it be perfect? No. But it'll be a hell of a lot better than the copy-paste farms out there.\n\nI'm adding new agents every week. Real ones. Tested ones. With actual opinions attached.\n\nI'm also writing comparisons—head-to-head breakdowns of competing tools so you can make an actual informed decision instead of guessing.\n\nAnd I'm keeping the site fast. No 10-second load times, no popups begging for your email before you've seen a single listing. Just the info you need.\n\nIf you're tired of useless directories, bookmark AgentRank. Or don't—I'm building this for me either way.\n\nBut if you're as fed up as I was with the state of AI tool discovery, maybe you'll find it useful.\n\nGot an AI agent you think deserves to be listed? Drop me a note at hugh.e.mcinnis@gmail.com. If it's legit and solves a real problem, I'll test it and add it.\n\nNo press releases. No affiliate pitches. Just good tools that actually work.",

    "fullText": "The comprehensive tactical resource for residents of Speranza. Detailed intelligence on machines, loot drops, quest lines, and weapon configurations.\n\nEven the smallest change in the ARC's behavior could mean catastrophe. And that signal you picked up? We've never intercepted anything like it before. If they're planning something, we have to find out what it is.\n\nOur food production is finally enough to meet our basic needs, but what we really need now is variety. I have a lead on some agricultural research from before the First Wave. Are you in?\n\nWe're short on everything but mouths to feed, yet Celeste's launching precious supplies into the air for Raiders to claw over. I'm done letting the good stuff go to waste.\n\nA comprehensive look at the tactical developments coming to Speranza in the first quarter of 2026. Discover upcoming map expansions, new machine variants, and major feature updates.\n\nThe first major stability and content update of the year. Patch 1.13.0 introduces machine behavior refinements, loot table adjustments for Stella Montis, and significant optimizations.\n\nThe database relies on field reports from raiders like you. Join the communications channel to submit data.\n\nWelcome to the premier database for ARC Raiders, the highly anticipated cooperative third-person extraction shooter from Embark Studios. Whether you are a veteran of the closed alpha or a new recruit preparing for the 2025 release, this Arc Raiders game guide is your essential companion. Our ARC Raiders wiki resource is designed to give you the tactical advantage needed to survive in the lethal world of Speranza. Our comprehensive toolkit covers everything from loot tables and crafting recipes to interactive maps and quest guides, making it the ultimate tool for every Arc Raiders player.\n\nIn the Arc Raiders game, survival is not guaranteed. As a Raider in ARC Raiders, you must scavenge for vital supplies, craft essential gear, and defend your squad against the ruthless ARC machines terrorizing the surface. Knowledge is your most valuable weapon in this Arc Raiders game. Understanding which loot to keep, which items to recycle for materials, and where to find rare drops can mean the difference between a successful extraction and losing everything.\n\nThe core loop of the Arc Raiders game revolves around three critical decisions: keep, sell, or recycle. Every item you find in ARC Raiders—from a broken alarm clock to a pristine ARC memory core—has a purpose.\n\nThe ARC machines are relentless. To defeat them in ARC Raiders, you must study their behaviors and weaknesses. Our database provides detailed intel on every machine type found in the Arc Raiders game.\n\nKnowing where to look is half the battle in the Arc Raiders game. Speranza is divided into several massive regions, each with unique biomes, danger levels, and loot pools. Understanding these zones is key to efficient farming runs in ARC Raiders.\n\nBest for: Batteries, Gears, Electronic Components, and Toolsets. Look for factories and warehouses. Essential for crafting ammunition and explosives in ARC Raiders.\n\nBest for: Antiseptics, Syringes, Bandages, and Stim-shots. Check field hospitals and pharmacies. PvP hotspots as every squad needs meds to survive the Arc Raiders game.\n\nBest for: Dog Collars, Valuables, Food, and Cosmetic items. Explore houses and apartment blocks. Great for solo players looking for quick credit items in ARC Raiders.\n\nBest for: Weapon Parts, Ammo, Access Keys, and Armor Plates. Expect heavy resistance. Often requires keys or hacking tools to access main loot rooms in the Arc Raiders game.\n\nProgression in ARC Raiders is deeply tied to your Hideout and your standing with Traders. Completing quests unlocks new gear, while upgrading your Hideout grants passive benefits and access to advanced crafting stations, essential for mastering the Arc Raiders game.\n\nAlways check your active quests before a raid. Many quests require specific \"found in raid\" items that cannot be purchased. Our Quest Guide lists all requirements and rewards, ensuring you never leave a raid without the items you need. Furthermore, mastering the workshop allows you to convert scavenged junk into lethal weaponry, a vital skill for any successful ARC Raiders raider.\n\nChoosing the right loadout for your squad is essential. In the Arc Raiders game, weapons define your role:\n\nFocus on collecting high-value trinkets (marked with a diamond icon) and completing Trader contracts. Residential zones in the Buried City map are often rich in sellable valuables in the Arc Raiders game.\n\nMost weapons are unlocked by increasing your reputation with Traders. You can also find blueprints in Security Zones which allow you to craft weapons at your Hideout's workshop, a core feature of ARC Raiders.\n\nNo, ARC Raiders is not free-to-play. Embark Studios shifted the Arc Raiders game from its original free-to-play model to a premium, paid experience, with a planned price point of approximately $40. The decision was made to ensure a better, more respectful experience for players, moving away from microtransaction-heavy models.\n\nWhile ARC Raiders is designed with squad-play in mind, solo play is fully supported. Solo raiders in the Arc Raiders game must rely on stealth and guerilla tactics to survive against larger groups and tough ARC machines.\n\nDisclaimer: This database is a fan-made resource for the Arc Raiders game community.

    "fullText": "NASA’s new boss blasted Boeing and the space agency Thursday for Starliner’s botched flight that left two astronauts stuck for months at the International Space Station.\n\nAdministrator Jared Isaacman said poor leadership and decision-making at Boeing led to Starliner’s troubles. He also blamed NASA managers for failing to intervene and get Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back more quickly.\n\nThe two test pilots, now retired from NASA, spent more than nine months at the station before catching a lift back with SpaceX last March.\n\nIsaacman said Starliner’s problems must be better understood and fixed before any more astronauts strap in.\n\nIn a sweeping and emphatic move, Isaacman upgraded the seriousness of Starliner's troubled astronaut debut, declaring it a “Type A mishap,” something that could endanger a crew. Both the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle disasters also involved cultural and leadership missteps. It is a mistake that Starliner was not designated a serious mishap right from the start, Isaacman said, citing internal pressure to keep Boeing on board and flights on track.\n\n“This is just about doing the right thing,” he said. “This is about getting the record straight.”\n\nThruster failures and other problems almost prevented Wilmore and Williams from reaching the space station following liftoff in 2024. The thruster analyses continue by Boeing.\n\n“We almost did have a really terrible day,\" said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya, referring to a potential loss of life.\n\nNASA issued its 312-page Starliner report while conducting a second fueling test of its moon rocket at Kennedy Space Center. Hydrogen fuel leaks spoiled the first dress rehearsal earlier this month and stalled astronauts' first flight to the moon since 1972.\n\nBoeing said the findings will help the company move forward in ensuring crew safety, and stressed that the Starliner program would continue. Time is running out as NASA proceeds toward decommissioning the space station in 2030, although Isaacman, a self-financed space traveler, foresees “endless demand” for multiple pathways to orbit once private outposts are booming.\n\nThere is no timeline for when Boeing can launch Starliner on a supply run, essentially another test flight to prove its safety before astronaut flights. The grounding leaves SpaceX as the only U.S. taxi service for astronauts.\n\n“Boeing has made substantial progress on corrective actions for technical challenges we encountered and driven significant cultural changes across the team,” Boeing said in a statement.\n\nEven before the troubled astronaut flight, Boeing was struggling with Starliner issues. The first test flight in 2019, without anyone on board, ended up in the wrong orbit and forced a repeat mission, which had its own difficulties.\n\nNASA hired Boeing and SpaceX in 2014, in the wake of the space shuttles’ retirement, to ferry astronauts to and from the orbiting lab. Their contracts are worth billions. SpaceX just delivered its 13th crew to the space station for NASA since 2020.\n\nKshatriya said the space agency must do better moving forward.\n\n“We have to own our part of this,” he said. As for Wilmore and Williams, “We failed them.\"\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Some posts linked to a Feb. 10, 2026, article in Texas Monthly (archived), which included a line that read, \"One of French's favorite phrases is 'third world savages'—which he has applied to Afghan asylum seekers, Muslims, and even Native Americans, who he also wants deported.\"\n\nIt is true that French called for the deportation of Native Americans. He did so in an Oct. 10, 2025, post on X (archived):\n\nSince we are going to denaturalize and deport all the third world savages who hate our country, I am calling for adding these third world savages, who we conquered, then bizarrely let have a nation inside our nation, to the list. pic.twitter.com/FfcUGeol0H\n\n— Bo French (@BoFrenchTX) October 21, 2025\n\nSince we are going to denaturalize and deport all the third world savages who hate our country, I am calling for adding these third world savages, who we conquered, then bizarrely let have a nation inside our nation, to the list.\n\nHis post included a photograph of what appeared to be three women and one girl wearing seemingly traditional clothes, raising their middle fingers to Mount Rushmore, where sculptor Gutzon Borglum carved the faces of U.S. Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nAn image search showed the earliest instance of this image being shared online was a 2024 Facebook post with the caption \"The only reason Natives visit is to do this,\" suggesting a protest against the history of European colonization in the United States, which resulted in the mass and systematic killing of indigenous peoples.\n\nAsked to explain his X post, a spokesperson for the French campaign said he did not mean to say the U.S. should deport all Native Americans, but only those in the photograph.\n\n\"Mr. French never called for the complete deportation of Native Americans,\" the spokesperson said in an email. \"If you look at his actual tweet from last year, he was specifically talking about the four people in the picture who obviously hate America.\"\n\nWe replied to ask which country he thought these four Native Americans should be deported to and will update this report should we receive a response.\n\nFrench also has repeatedly called for the denaturalization of U.S. citizens. He described (archived) Texas Tribune reporter Carlos Noguera Ramos, who wrote a story about French, as a \"soon to be deported journalist.\" Noguera Ramos' bio on the Texas Monthly website says he is Puerto Rican, which makes him a U.S. citizen.\n\nFor further reading, Snopes previously reported that French once spread the claim that voting machines in Tarrant County, Texas, where he was the Republican Party chair, flipped votes for Trump into votes for former Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.

    "fullText": "Nick Reiner has reportedly not yet received any visits from family members amid his stay in jail after being accused of killing his parents, Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner.\n\nRelatives are said to be keeping their distance as they are struggling to come to terms with the accusations against him while also mourning the deaths of Rob and Michele Reiner.\n\nThe accused is due to appear in court again on February 23, where he will be represented by a public defender following the sudden withdrawal of his high-profile attorney.\n\nBack in December, Nick Reiner was arrested for allegedly murdering his parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, at their home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.\n\nHe is currently being detained at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility, and according to reports, there have been no contact or prison visits from family members.\n\nSources have now explained why the family is keeping their distance amid ongoing legal processes ahead of Nick's murder trial.\n\n\"This isn't a misunderstanding or a minor scandal,\" an insider told Rob Shuter's #ShuterScoop. \"He killed their parents. That changes everything.\"\n\nAnother source described the feelings of the family as \"grief layered on top of horror,\" while suggesting they have yet to come to terms with the murder accusations brought against Nick.\n\n\"They're mourning their parents while also trying to comprehend what he's done. You don't just walk into a visiting room after that,\" said the insider.\n\nIn the early days of Nick's time in jail, he was placed on suicide watch, as is customary in such cases.\n\nThe alleged killer has since been taken off suicide watch and is now allowed to receive visitors if he chooses.\n\nHe is, however, unlikely to have any visitors, as some of his relatives feel it is too soon. This stance is also said to be unlikely to change, given the severity of the allegations against him.\n\n\"It's too soon — and for some of them, it may always be too soon,\" said one insider, according to the report.\n\nNick is the eldest child of Rob and Michele Reiner, who also have two other children, Max and Robbie.\n\nHis siblings and several of his other relatives have been forced to watch in shock as the family remains under intense public scrutiny while Nick awaits trial.\n\nFor all of them, the chosen approach is one of \"silence.\" This is reportedly not meant as a punishment or act of revenge against Nick, but rather as a way to establish a necessary boundary.\n\n\"Silence isn't about cruelty,\" said a source. \"It's about boundaries. It's about surviving something unthinkable.\"\n\nPreviously, it was reported that Nick's family was deeply concerned about the possibility of further details from his medical history being made public.\n\nAlready, claims of the accused being diagnosed with schizophrenia have swirled since his arrest, something the family never wanted, as they had intentionally kept these details from the public to protect.\n\n\"They've worked so hard to keep these issues private — no one knew about them,\" a source told Rob Shuter.\n\nIf more information about Nick's medical history were to come out, it is expected to deal a heavy emotional blow to the family, who remain deeply concerned about Nick, albeit from a distance.\n\n\"This is not just a legal case — it's a family tragedy,\" another insider shared. \"They're terrified of what happens if everything becomes public, and of the toll it will take on everyone who loved Rob, Michele, and Nick.\"\n\nNick is yet to enter a plea on the two counts of murder with special circumstances, but may likely do so when he returns to court on February 23.\n\nHe is currently being represented by a public defender after his high-profile lawyer, Alan Jackson, suddenly withdrew as his counsel during a hearing last month.\n\nThis forced the hearing to be rescheduled for the aforementioned date to give time to the public defender to get up to speed with the case.\n\nFollowing a plea, additional hearings are expected, along with other court proceedings such as the exchange of evidence between the parties, potential motions concerning the defendant's mental health, and arguments over the admissibility of evidence.\n\nEventually, Nick's trial will be held, and if found guilty, he could potentially face the death penalty.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A large banner featuring Donald Trump's face was hung on the exterior of Justice Department headquarters on Thursday in a physical display of the Republican president's efforts to exert power over the law enforcement agency that once investigated him.\n\nWhile Trump banners have been hung outside other agencies across Washington, the decision to place one on the storied Justice Department building amounted to a striking symbol of the erosion of the department's tradition of independence from White House control.\n\nThe banner, hung between two columns on one corner of the building, says, “Make America Safe Again,” a slogan used by the administration to tout its efforts to clamp down on illegal immigration and violent crime.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi has postured herself as the president's chief supporter and protector, eschewing the approach of predecessors who sought to maintain an arms-length distance from the White House to protect the impartiality of investigations and prosecutions.\n\nTrump officials have rejected accusations that they have weaponized the Justice Department for political purposes, saying the Biden administration was the one that politicized law enforcement with two federal criminal cases against Trump that were abandoned after he won the 2024 election.\n\nThe Justice Department in a statement Thursday said it is proud to “celebrate 250 years of our great country and our historic work to make America safe again at President Trump’s direction.”\n\nThe Trump administration has opened investigations into a number of the president's perceived enemies, amplifying concerns that the agency is being used to exact revenge on his political foes.\n\nFederal prosecutors brought charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey that were later dismissed, and separately sought to indict several Democratic lawmakers in connection with a video in which they urged U.S. military members to resist “illegal orders.\"\n\nIn a social media post, Comey said the banner was “sickening to see,” adding that the administration \"forgot to cover the inscription” on one side of the building that says, “Where law ends tyranny begins.\"\n\nThe department is also investigating Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over congressional testimony and Democratic Minnesota officials over whether they obstructed federal immigration enforcement through public statements.",

    "title": "Trump Wants Veterans to Lose Benefits As Soon As Their PTSD Symptoms Are Treated. There’s One Problem With That.",
    "description": "The consequences of this shift are not abstract.",
    "fullText": "During the troop surge in Iraq, I learned to constantly scan for threats, how to distinguish the sharp crack of a gunshot pointed in my direction from one outgoing toward an enemy, and the myriad ways that explosives can be hidden on a roadside. I learned that hypervigilance can be the difference between life and death. What I didn’t learn was how to turn it off.\n\nNow, I take three psychiatric medications every day, and I go to therapy every week. It’s taken a lot of work over the course of 15 years, but now I’m mostly functional. I raise my kids, go to work, and am part of my community. And I am among the nearly 5 million U.S. veterans who receive service-connected disability compensation, of whom roughly a quarter have a mental health condition such as post-traumatic stress disorder as their primary disability. That compensation is not charity, but compensation for harm incurred in service and a recognition that the government has a debt when the service it demands breaks bodies and minds.\n\nBut now, under a new interim rule issued by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the fact that medication helps me may also be used to reduce my disability compensation. The rule directs the VA to evaluate disabilities based on how veterans function with medication and treatment, rather than the underlying severity of their conditions. Essentially, if the pills work, good job staying alive; now move on without compensation for the inherent disability.\n\nThis issue was actually very recently litigated. Last year, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims decided Ingram v. Collins, a case that reaffirmed a rule first articulated in Jones v. Shinseki. The court was clear: When VA criteria for treatment do not explicitly mention medication-based improvements as a reason to discontinue disability benefits, the VA must discount the effects of medication and evaluate the disability as it would exist without treatment. That was not a radical interpretation but a straightforward application of the law. Treatment can mask symptoms, but it does not erase the harm. In response, the VA’s new rule asserts a blanket policy of considering the condition only as it presents under treatment, basically penalizing veterans like me for doing the work of staying alive.\n\nThe consequences of this shift are not abstract. Peer-reviewed research and VA data show that disability compensation is directly linked to real-life stability for veterans with mental health conditions. A long-term study following veterans who applied for PTSD disability benefits found that those who received benefits experienced meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms over a decade, compared with veterans who were denied. Those who received compensation were far less likely to experience poverty, with rates around 15 percent, compared to 45 percent among those denied benefits, and their risk of homelessness was nearly half that of denied veterans. Even years later, these differences in socioeconomic stability persisted, despite ongoing impairment. Compensation does not erase the injury, but it gives veterans the resources to manage it and live with it.\n\nI know the stakes personally. The medication I take does not erase the injury. When I have stopped my medication, the symptoms have surged back. I have found myself back in the dark place where I think that I would have been better off if the IED with my name on it that I had always been scanning for had actually gone off and killed me. I have buried too many friends whose treatment worked until it didn’t. Their medications stabilized them, and their therapy helped them, but the underlying injury remained. Now they are dead by suicide.\n\nThis is why Ingram mattered. It recognized that improvement through treatment should not cancel out evidence of injury. Symptoms managed by medication are still symptoms, and the underlying disability remains. The VA’s interim rule rejects this principle, allowing improved function to justify rejection of disability status.\n\nThe moral and legal logic of compensation is clear: It is not just about whether a veteran can work. It is about acknowledging permanent loss of quality of life that came as a result of their injuries. For example, in the civilian context, when construction workers fall off scaffolds and can’t walk until receiving surgery and physical therapy, their employers have to provide them workers’ compensation. It doesn’t matter if treatment can return them to full function and they can eventually return to work. The injuries occurred on the job, and the company has to provide compensation. “You break it, you buy it.” But for the Trump administration, despite its lavish spending on tax breaks for billionaires, military contracts, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement surges that are tearing the country apart, properly compensating veterans for sacrificing their well-being at the direction of the government is a waste of money that we don’t deserve.\n\nThe Trump administration’s interim rule fundamentally misunderstands both the law and the human cost of combat. Improvement does not equal cure, and functioning does not erase harm. VA disability compensation is not a paycheck. It is a recognition of veterans’ lives that will never be the same and a resource to help them pick up the pieces. The fact that symptoms can be controlled through daily maintenance medications is proof the injury is permanent and severe, not that medication can just make it go away. The law once recognized that distinction, and basic decency still should.",

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates fell sharply this week as tensions between the US and Iran stoked the possibility of military conflict. Inflation concerns also lingered, as evidenced in the minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest meeting.\n\nThe 30-year fixed mortgage rate fell 8 basis points to 6.01% for the week ending Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac. That's the lowest level since September 2022. The 15-year fixed dropped 9 basis points to 5.35%.\n\n“This lower rate environment is not only improving affordability for prospective homebuyers, it’s also strengthening the financial position of homeowners,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. \"Over the past year, refinance application activity has more than doubled, enabling many recent buyers to reduce their annual mortgage payments by thousands of dollars.”\n\nIndeed, refinance applications increased over the past week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Tim Torline, president of investments at Ducenta Squared in Los Angeles, said the rise can be attributed to a small slice of borrowers with higher original loan rates.\n\n“Refinancing activity is likely to be moderate in the near-term, with the market likely on hold until mortgage rates fall below the 6% psychological threshold,” Torline said in a statement.\n\nDiscover the best mortgage refinance lenders\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nHere are 8 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rate possible.\n\nHere are today's mortgage refinance interest rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAs with mortgage rates for purchase, these are national averages that we've rounded to the nearest hundredth. Refinance rates can be higher than purchase mortgage rates, but that isn't always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use as you shop for homes and lenders. Be sure to use the dropdown to include private mortgage insurance costs and HOA dues if they apply to you. These monthly expenses, along with your mortgage principal and interest rate, will give you a realistic idea of what your monthly payment could be.\n\nA mortgage interest rate is the fee charged by a lender for borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. There are two basic types of mortgage rates: fixed and adjustable rates.\n\nA fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you get a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will remain at 6% for the entire 30 years. (Unless you refinance or sell the home.)\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for the first few years, then changes it periodically. Let’s say you get a 5/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first five years, and then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 25 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and the U.S. housing market.\n\nAt the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. As time passes, less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed.\n\nLearn how to choose between an adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nTwo categories determine mortgage rates: things you can control and those you cannot.\n\nWhat factors can you control? First, you can compare the best mortgage lenders to find the one that gives you the lowest rate and fees.\n\nSecond, lenders typically extend lower rates to people with higher credit scores, lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and considerable down payments. If you can save more or pay down debt before securing a mortgage, a lender will probably give you a better interest rate.\n\nWhat factors can you not control? In short, the economy.\n\nThe list of ways the economy impacts mortgage rates is long, but here are the basic details. If the economy — for example, employment — is struggling, mortgage rates decrease to encourage borrowing, which helps boost the economy. If the economy is strong, mortgage rates go up to temper spending.\n\nWith all other factors being equal, mortgage refinance rates are typically slightly higher than purchase rates. So don't be surprised if your refinance rate is higher than you may have expected.\n\nTwo of the most common mortgage terms are 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages. Both lock in your rate for the entire loan term.\n\nA 30-year mortgage is popular because it has relatively low monthly payments. But it comes with a higher interest rate than shorter terms, and because you’re accumulating interest for three decades, you’ll pay a lot of interest in the long run.\n\nA 15-year mortgage can be a good choice because it has a lower rate than you’ll get with longer terms, so you’ll pay less in interest over the years. You’ll also pay off your mortgage much faster. But your monthly payments will be higher because you’re paying off the same loan amount in half the time.\n\nBasically, 30-year mortgages are more affordable from month to month, while 15-year mortgages are cheaper in the long run.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance's weekly survey of lenders with the lowest rates, some of the banks with the lowest mortgage rates are Chase and Citibank. However, it's a good idea to shop around for the best rate, not just with banks, but also with credit unions and companies specializing in mortgage lending.\n\nYes, 2.75% is an amazing mortgage rate. You're unlikely to get a 2.75% rate in today's market unless you take on an assumable mortgage from a seller who locked in this rate in 2020 or 2021, when rates were at all-time lows.\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the lowest-ever 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 2.65%. This was the national average in January 2021. It is extremely unlikely that rates will dip below 3% again anytime soon.\n\nSome experts say it's worth refinancing when you can lock in a rate that's 2% less than your current mortgage rate. Others say 1% is the magic number. It all depends on your financial goals when refinancing, how long you plan to stay in the same house, and on your break-even point after paying the refinance closing costs.\n\nWhat caused mortgage rates to fall this week?\n\nHow are lower rates affecting refinance activity?\n\nHow do 30-year and 15-year rates compare?\n\nWhat factors determine current mortgage rate levels?\n\nMortgage rates often decrease before a Federal Reserve meeting rather than after. So, what should you expect rates to do before the Fed meeting on January 27-28?\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac already buy mortgage bonds, and Trump wants them to purchase $200 billion in bonds. Would this strategy cause mortgage rates to decrease?\n\nAverage mortgage rates are in the low 6% range, but there are ways to snag a lower rate. Learn about eight strategies for securing a mortgage rate under 6%.\n\nChase Home Lending has launched a mortgage refinance rate sale, and borrowers have until Sunday to lock in a discounted rate. Here's how to qualify and apply.\n\nInterest rates on HELOCs and home equity loans work differently. So, how much interest can you expect to pay on a second mortgage? Learn how these rates work.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump appeared to be struggling to stay awake as others spoke at his inaugural meeting of the so-called “Board of Peace.”\n\nThe president, 79, rambled for more than 45 minutes before taking a seat on stage Thursday as others addressed the group gathered in Washington, DC.\n\nCameras repeatedly caught Trump with his eyes closed as the event dragged on.\n\nThe president’s eyelids appeared to grow heavy on Thursday as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair was speaking, less than an hour after the president took his own seat following his address.\n\nAt one point as world leaders spoke, he jolted back into a straighter position when applause rang out, snapping his eyes open.\n\nIt’s the latest in a series of public gatherings where the oldest president ever elected appeared to nod off in front of the cameras.\n\nThe president has defended his moments of shuteye during his meetings after he was seen dozing off at roundtables and Cabinet meetings at the White House.\n\nDuring his most recent gathering of top officials late last month, the president insisted he did not sleep through his December Cabinet meeting but argued he only closed his eyes at the previous gathering because it got “pretty boring.”\n\n“It was a little bit at the boring side, but I didn’t sleep,” Trump claimed at the time.\n\nHe also claimed the cameras had simply captured him during a moment where he was blinking, but the explanation conflicted with the moments being captured on video.\n\nTrump’s habit of closing his eyes while meeting with top officials and world leaders—followed by social media posting rampages in the middle of the night—has raised questions about the 79-year-old’s cognitive decline and fitness in office.\n\nBesides jolting up at one point on Thursday as Sheikh Jarrah Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah of Kuwait spoke, the president also appeared to be slumped slightly to the side with his eyes closed as the king of Bahrain spoke.\n\nEven resting his eyes would have been strange behavior after the president declared his “Board of Peace” the “most consequential board.”\n\n“There’s never been anything close because these are the greatest world leaders,” Trump declared in his comments at the top of the event.\n\nAt the end of the three-hour event, the president remained seated as other world leaders gathered around him as he signed the fundraising pledges. Trump then handed off the documents to those next to him to hold up, and handed out pens as if he were participating in a bill-signing ceremony at the White House.",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — Katherine Eddington was driving in North Las Vegas last week when she thought she saw a big black bird carrying a banana fly across the intersection.\n\nBut after a closer look, she realized it was a toucan — a tropical bird native to rainforests in Central and South America known for their large, colorful bills.\n\n“They’re beautiful birds, so being able to see something like that so close to home was fascinating,” said Eddington, who recognized the bird from social media and contacted animal rescue.\n\nThat toucan is named Sam, and he has been living in the area since November, when a resident posted online that he'd escaped from his cage. After surviving the Las Vegas desert for months, Sam has captivated community birding groups, with people posting occasional sightings around town.\n\nA local rescue group has been trying to catch him for months — and the clock is ticking.\n\n“I’m really worried about him,” said Skye Marsh, president and co-founder of SouthWest Exotic Avian Rescue. The Las Vegas-based group has spent hours searching for him, only to find the bird 50 feet (about 15 meters) up in a palm tree, limiting rescue options. They have not been in touch with the owner, she said.\n\nLas Vegas is not a good environment for a toucan to be in the wild with its too-hot summers and cold winters, said Donald Price, a professor and biologist at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas who studies how winged animal species adapt to different environments.\n\nMarsh, who has two toucans of her own, said Sam is starting to show signs of struggle. His eyes are sunken in, and the skin around his beak is starting to get discolored, she said.\n\nSam likely lived off figs and pomegranates from trees in the Los Prados neighborhood, located about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip, when he first escaped in November, Marsh said. Those fruits have since disappeared, and Sam has moved on to citrus, which are harmful to toucans, she said. Their livers cannot process the calcium, and the iron can be deadly.\n\n“This bird is not in good shape,” Marsh said.\n\nBird experts and enthusiasts alike are surprised the toucan has survived so long in Las Vegas. Exotic birds that escape often have difficulty finding food and avoiding predators, and the changing weather in Las Vegas has also likely taken a toll on the toucan.\n\nBirds can thermal regulate, but only for so long. It takes a lot of energy, so the toucan would need more food, Price said.\n\n“If it’s still alive, it could be in trouble, I can imagine. So hopefully they catch it,\" he said.\n\nThe toucan has been spotted in one specific location, a sign he’s running out of energy, she said. The rescue group set up a cage with food in it and urged neighbors to stop feeding it. The toucan has scoped out the cage but gets spooked when people are around, Marsh said.\n\nThe rescue group will rush him to the vet as soon as he's caught, Marsh said. He’ll need fluids, and his system will need to be flushed to remove the iron he’s eaten.\n\nMarsh urged neighbors to not get close to the toucan or try to trap Sam themselves.\n\n“The more people that are out there, the worse it’s going to be because he doesn’t like people,” she said. “So just let us do our thing, and we’ll get him.”",

    "description": "Some economists are warning there’s no sign of AI-related job displacement appearing in the labor data. Altman claimed it’s just a matter of time until it does.",
    "fullText": "As debate continues over AI’s true impact on the labor force, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said some companies are engaging in “AI washing” when it comes to layoffs, or falsely attributing workforce reductions to the technology’s impact.\n\n“I don’t know what the exact percentage is, but there’s some AI washing where people are blaming AI for layoffs that they would otherwise do, and then there’s some real displacement by AI of different kinds of jobs,” Altman told CNBC-TV18 at the India AI Impact Summit on Thursday.\n\nAI washing has gained traction as emerging data on the tech’s impact on the labor market tells a muddied, inconclusive story about how the technology is destroying human jobs—or if it has yet to touch them.\n\nA study published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research, for example, found that of thousands of surveyed C-suite executives across the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and Australia, nearly 90% said AI had no impact on workplace employment over the past three years following the late-2022 release of ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, prominent tech leaders like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have warned of a white-collar bloodbath, with AI potentially wiping out 50% of entry-level office jobs. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski suggested this week the buy-now, pay-later firm would reduce its 3,000-person workforce by one-third by 2030 in part because of the acceleration of AI. Around 40% of employers expect to follow Siemiatkowski’s lead in culling staff down the line as a result of AI, according to the 2025 World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report.\n\nAltman clarified he anticipates more job displacement as a result of AI, as well as the emergence of new roles complementing the technology.\n\n“We’ll find new kinds of jobs, as we do with every tech revolution,” he said. “But I would expect that the real impact of AI doing jobs in the next few years will begin to be palpable.”\n\nData from a recent Yale Budget Lab report suggests Altman and Amodei’s vision of mass worker displacement from AI is not certain and is not yet here. Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Population Survey, the research found no significant differences in the rate of change of occupations mix or length of unemployment for individuals with jobs that have high exposure to AI from the release of ChatGPT through November 2025. The numbers suggested no significant AI-related labor changes at this juncture.\n\n“No matter which way you look at the data, at this exact moment, it just doesn’t seem like there’s major macroeconomic effects here,” Martha Gimbel, executive director and cofounder of the Yale Budget Lab, told Fortune earlier this month.",

    "fullText": "TEPETITLAN, Mexico, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Mexican authorities raided a tunnel used to steal fuel from a state-owned pipeline this week, offering a rare glimpse ‌into a long-running battle against a black-market trade often dominated by organized crime.\n\nThe 22-meter-long (72-foot-long) ‌tunnel was discovered outside a home in rural Hidalgo state near the town of Tepetitlan.\n\nIt led to two taps ​on an underground pipeline, the Hidalgo state attorney said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that security forces also seized drugs there.\n\nThe Hidalgo state attorney declined to elaborate on the announcement. A person familiar with the operation who spoke on condition of anonymity said there have been no arrests ‌so far in connection with ⁠the tunnel.\n\nWhile authorities did not name the pipeline, Reuters matched the site coordinates to an energy ministry map of hydrocarbon infrastructure, identifying it as ⁠the conduit owned by state energy company Pemex between the Tula refinery in Hidalgo to the Salamanca refinery in Guanajuato state.\n\nWhen Reuters journalists visited the site on Wednesday near the rural settlement of ​Sayula, Army ​and National Guard personnel were standing guard, and ​a banner reading \"property seized\" was posted.\n\nHuachicol, ‌as the theft and sale of fuel is known in Mexico, was originally the domain of local criminal gangs but has transformed into a violent, multi-billion-dollar business dominated by powerful cartels. It can involve gasoline, diesel and other refined products as well as crude oil.\n\nPemex did not respond to a request for comment. It reported the discovery of 11,774 illegal taps on its ‌pipelines in 2024.\n\nThe company said in a U.S. regulatory ​filing last year that efforts to combat the black-market ​trade \"have not produced sustained improvement in recent ​years.\"\n\nThieves usually dig long tunnels from private land to reach pipelines. The ‌stolen fuel is often sold locally in ​glass bottles or plastic ​canisters at a steep discount to petrol station prices.\n\nTunnels used to tap into pipelines often have elaborate engineering so fuel can be siphoned without causing pipeline pressure to ​drop enough to alert Pemex.\n\nThe ‌fuels are highly flammable and accidents occur, including an explosion caused by suspected ​fuel thieves that killed at least 137 people in 2019.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Trump administration has issued a sweeping new order that could lead to the arrest of tens of thousands of refugees who are lawfully in the United States but do not yet have permanent residency, overturning years of legal and immigration safeguards.\n\nA memo filed by the Department of Homeland Security ahead of a Thursday federal court hearing in Minnesota says refugees applying for green cards must return to federal custody one year after they were admitted to the U.S. for review of their applications.\n\nDHS “may maintain custody for the duration of the inspection and examination process,” said the memo, which was filed Wednesday.\n\nAdvocacy and resettlement groups slammed the order, which will likely face legal challenges and could sow confusion and fear among the nearly 200,000 refugees who came to the United States during the Biden administration.\n\nThe order is the latest in a series of immigration restrictions by the Trump administration, which has upended longstanding policies toward refugees, including dramatically reducing the number admitted into the country. A memo obtained by The Associated Press late last year said the administration was planning a review of all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration, and immediately suspended green card approvals for refugees who arrived during those years.\n\nThe administration has cited national security and economic concerns for its changed policies. Experts say refugees let into the country already undergo extensive vetting.\n\nThe new order came hours before U.S. District Judge John Tunheim heard arguments Thursday on whether he should extend a temporary order that protects Minnesota refugees lawfully in the U.S. from being arrested and deported. Tunheim’s order applies only in Minnesota, but the implications of the new national policy was a major part of the discussion anyway.\n\nHow many people could be arrested under the new order was unclear.\n\nJustice Department attorney Brantley Mayers said during Thursday's hearing that the government should have the right to arrest refugees one year after entering the U.S., but indicated that would not always happen.\n\n“That's a discretion call for DHS to make,” he said, a comment met with skepticism by attorneys for the Minnesota refugees.\n\nTunheim did not rule Thursday, saying he’d issue a written decision on whether the temporary order would be extended.\n\nAfter the hearing, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota said at a news conference outside the courthouse that the government \"failed to offer any coherent argument for their policy in either law or fact.” She wasn’t in court for the hearing, but said she'd been briefed about it.\n\n“And so we will continue the fight for justice in the courts,” Smith said, flanked by attorneys and refugee rights supporters, including U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar.\n\nImmigration advocates quickly pushed back against the new policy, with HIAS, an international Jewish nonprofit serving refugees and asylum-seekers, calling it “a transparent effort to detain and potentially deport thousands of people who are legally present in this country, people the U.S. government itself welcomed.”\n\n“They were promised safety and the chance to rebuild their lives. Instead, DHS is now threatening them with arrest and indefinite detention,\" Beth Oppenheim, the group's CEO, said in a statement.\n\nTunheim blocked the government from targeting the Minnesota refugees last month, saying the plaintiffs in the case were likely to prevail on their claims “that their arrest and detention, and the policy that purports to justify them, are unlawful.” His Jan. 28 temporary restraining order will expire Feb. 25 unless he grants a more permanent preliminary injunction.\n\nThe judge previously rejected the government’s claim that it had the legal right to arrest and detain refugees who haven’t obtained their green cards within a year of arriving in the U.S.\n\n“Mandating detention would lead to an illogical result,” Tunheim wrote, since refugees can’t even apply for green cards until they’ve been in the U.S. for a year. The government's interpretation, he said, means nearly all refugees would face detention unless immigration officials conducted their review at exactly the one-year mark, which he called “nonsensical.”\n\nRefugee rights groups sued the federal government in January after the government launched Operation PARRIS, an acronym for Post-Admission Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening.\n\nIt was billed as a “sweeping initiative” to reexamine the cases of 5,600 Minnesota refugees who had not yet been granted permanent resident status, or green cards. The agencies cited fraud in public programs in Minnesota as justification.\n\nOperation PARRIS was part of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown targeting Minnesota, including a surge of thousands of federal officers. Homeland Security called it the largest immigration enforcement operation ever. It sparked mass protests after federal agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens. White House border czar Tom Homan announced last week the surge was ending, though a small federal presence would remain.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that ICE officers went door to door under Operation PARRIS arresting refugees and sending them to detention centers in Texas, without access to attorneys. Some were later released in Texas and left to find their own way back to Minnesota, they said.\n\nTunheim noted in his order that refugees are extensively vetted by multiple agencies before being resettled in the U.S. He wrote that none arrested in the operation had been deemed a danger to the community or a flight risk, nor had any been charged with crimes that could be grounds for deportation.\n\nTunheim stressed that the refugees impacted by his order were admitted into the U.S. because of persecution in their home countries. He prohibited further arrests under Operation PARRIS and ordered that detainees still in custody from it be released and returned to Minnesota.\n\n“They are not committing crimes on our streets, nor did they illegally cross the border. Refugees have a legal right to be in the United States, a right to work, a right to live peacefully,” he wrote.",
