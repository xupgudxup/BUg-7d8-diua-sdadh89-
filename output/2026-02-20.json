In fact, some think that around Week 6 could be a more realistic timeline.\n\nEither way, the Chiefs have to solve their roster issues, but in the meantime, they are giving their fans the chance to buy some pretty cool items that will no doubt have a lot of value attached to them.\n\nAnalyst offers Mike Evans reality that might soothe Buccaneers' worries\n\nESPN analyst thinks Dolphins' Tua Tagovailoa decision has already been made\n\nTexans' Dalton Schultz offers interesting C.J.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSpring Training might be here, but there’s still plenty of time to make a trade, and we should start to see some over the next few days to weeks prior to Opening Day.\n\nSports Illustrated’s Ryan Shea floated an intriguing trade that could help the Chicago Cubs and Seattle Mariners.\n\nIn the hypothetical trade, Seattle would acquire Gold Glove infielder Nico Hoerner, while Chicago would secure a package of young, controllable talent, which would improve its long-term core.\n\nCubs acquire: Emerson Hancock, Colt Emerson, Cole Young\n\nFrom Seattle’s standpoint, adding Hoerner would provide another really good offensive player at the top of their lineup and elite defense, which are two areas the Mariners have wanted to improve in recent years. For Chicago, the move would be to get off of Hoerner before likely losing him for nothing in free agency in 2027.\n\n“From Chicago’s perspective, moving Hoerner at peak value allows them to acquire controllable assets aligned with a longer-term competitive window. Emerson provides a premium middle infield prospect, Hancock adds a near-MLB-ready starting pitcher, and Young offers a high upside infielder with strong contact skills,” he wrote.\n\nHancock could slot into the rotation in the short term, while Emerson and Young would give the Cubs two promising infield building blocks as they reshape their farm system. However, with Dansby Swanson and Alex Bregman in the infield, the Cubs have enough infielders, so that’s something to consider.\n\nWhether Chicago will move on from Hoerner remains uncertain, but the noise is there and it seems like it’ll happen sometime in the near future.\n\nNew York Yankees trade proposal moves Cam Schlittler, George Lombard Jr, and Spencer Jones for generational award winner\n\nNew York Yankees fans will love Aaron Judge’s slight shot at Brian Cashman\n\nNew York Yankees urged to pair Aaron Judge with Bryce Harper for World Baseball Classic reason\n\nNew York Yankees get excellent injury news on Giancarlo Stanton as Spring Training gets underway\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies almost got bailed out of Nick Castellanos situation by historic team in American League\n\nNew York Yankees almost made a $20 million mistake but decided to sign Paul Goldschmidt instead",

Strickland said \"nobody gives a f*ck\" about women's sports, claimed \"the softest\" male could beat up Nunes, a former two-division UFC champion who's considered the greatest female fighter of all time. Strickland went on to state women are \"too empowered,\" and should focus on \"making food and cleaning the house.\"\n\nWell, fast-forward a day later, and Nunes has issued a response to Strickland's controversial comments.\n\n\"We do everything he said, and to top it all off, lol, we’re fighters too. #girlpower don’t cry,\" Nunes wrote on Instagram.\n\nThis isn't the first time Strickland has been the subject of controversy. He's long been public about his bigoted and racist views.\n\nStrickland returns to the cage this Saturday in the main event of UFC Fight Night 267 in Houston, Texas. He takes on fellow top contender Anthony Hernandez in a five-round bout. Ahead of the fight, Strickland posted a meme of himself with an ICE uniform and Hernandez, who's of Mexican descent, with a traditional Mexican hat and poncho.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Amanda Nunes responds to Sean Strickland's comments: 'Don't cry'",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlysa Liu's performance at the 2026 Winter Olympics was historic.\n\nThe 20-year-old, who came into Milan as the reigning 2025 world champion, didn't just help secure a gold medal for the United States in the team figure skating event. She also won the women's singles, becoming Team USA's first Olympic champion in the event in decades.\n\nLiu made a figure skating comeback to reach the pinnacle of the Winter Olympics. It paid off, as she joined an exclusive club of American women who have won an Olympic gold medal in the figure skating singles event.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the eight figure skaters Liu has joined.\n\nMORE 2026 OLYMPICS: Live medal tracker | Viewer's guide | Day-by-day schedule\n\nThere have now been eight women to win a gold medal for Team USA in singles figure skating.\n\nRunner-up: Carol Heiss (United States)\n\nThe first American woman to become a figure skating champion was Tenley Albright, who won the 1956 event in Cortina d'Ampezzo. Prior to then, Albright had already been a one-time Olympic silver medalist (1952) and two-time World Champion (1953, 1955) in the event.\n\nA native of Newton, Massachusetts, Albright would retire from competitive skating after 1956. She became the chief physician for the US Winter Olympics team in 1976 and the vice president of the U.S. Olympic Committee in 1982. Albright was also inducted into the International Women's Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nNow 90 years old, she was a pioneer in Olympic figure skating for American women.\n\nRunner-up: Sjoukje Dijkstra (Netherlands)\n\nAfter finishing as the runner-up to her fellow American in the 1956 Winter Olympics, Carol Heiss broke through with a gold medal in 1960, becoming the champion at the Squaw Valley Games in California.\n\nHeiss bested Dutch skater Sjoukje Dijkstra for gold that year. Heiss, who grew up in Queens, New York, was also a five-time figure skating World Champion. She retired after winning the 1960 World Championship.\n\nHeiss was also the first female skater to land a double axel jump. She was later inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame and the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame.\n\nMORE: How Alysa Liu dropped an \"F-bomb\" after her free skate at 2026 Winter Olympics\n\nRunner-up: Gabriele Seyfert (Germany)\n\nIn 1968, the U.S. had its third gold medalist in the women's figure skating singles event in the past four Winter Olympics. Peggy Fleming was the champion, and she ended up being the lone American gold medalist at the entire 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France.\n\nFleming grew up in California and went on to win three World Championships in addition to her Olympic gold medal.\n\nLater in life, Fleming became a vocal breast cancer activist after being diagnosed in 1998 and undergoing successful surgery. She appeared in the 2007 movie Blades of Glory, and now 77 years old, Fleming has also been a longtime television commentator in figure skating.\n\nRunner-up: Dianne de Leeuw (Netherlands)\n\nThe U.S. had another gold medalist by 1976, when Dorothy Hamill, who was born in Chicago but raised in Connecticut, won the event in Innsbruck, Austria.\n\nHammill was the last single skater to win the Olympics without a triple jump. Also in 1976, she was the women's singles World Champion.\n\nIn the years after her Olympic success, Hammill continued to skate professionally, from being an Ice Capades headliner from 1977 to 1984 to skating for \"Broadway on Ice.\" She's also made appearances on \"Dancing With The Stars\" and the Foot Network Show \"Chopped,\" and Hammill has written two autobiographies. Hammill is now 69 years old.\n\nMORE: What is a quadruple axel?\n\nThe U.S. went through a stretch without any gold medalists in women's figure skating, but Kristi Yamaguchi was the one who broke the cold spell in 1992. She also became the first Asian-American to win a gold medal in a Winter Olympics event, doing so in the Albertville Games in France.\n\nYamaguchi beat out Japan's Midori Ito for gold. In her career, she also was a two-time World Champion (1991, 1992) and a two-time national champion in pairs with Rudy Galindo. She retired from competition in 1992, then went on to perform in shows professionally, including winning the World Professional Figure Skating Championships four times.\n\nA 2005 U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame induction, Yamaguchi later became an author, 2008 member of \"Dancing With The Stars,\" and has made appearances in television skating special like \"Aladdin on Ice.\"\n\nRunner-up: Michelle Kwan (United States)\n\nThe United States had the gold and silver medalists in the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics in Japan. While Michelle Kwan finished as the runner-up, Tara Lipinski took gold.\n\nLipinski also was the 1997 U.S. and world champion, and she was the first woman to complete a triple loop–triple loop combination in a competition. For years, it was Lipinski who held the mark as the youngest single skater to win the U.S. Nationals, the Olympics, and the world championships.\n\nAfter retiring in 1998, Lipinski spent time performing in live shows, but she can now be heard as one of NBC's primary figure skating announcers — including at the 2026 Winter Olympics. She has held her position with the network since 2014.\n\nMORE: How does figure skating scoring work?\n\nRunner-up: Irina Slutskaya (Russia)\n\nOnce again, Michelle Kwan earned a medal for the U.S. in 2002, but it was Sarah Hughes who finished at the top of the figure skating singles leaderboard to win gold.\n\nHughes, who is from New York, went from winning bronze at the 2000 World Championships to Olympic gold, becoming the United States' seventh-ever gold medalist in women's singles figure skating. Her victory was considered a huge upset, as she was the youngest skater in the competition. The runner-up, Russia's Irina Slutskaya, and the bronze medalist, Kwan, were the favorites.\n\nHughes became the first woman in Olympic history to land two triple jump–triple jump combinations in a free skate, securing gold. She was later inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\nFor many years, Hughes, now 40 years old, was the United States' last female Olympic figure skating champion.\n\nRunner-up: Kaori Sakamoto, Japan\n\nIt took 24 years since the last American Olympic champion in the event, but Alysa Liu broke through in the 2026 Winter Olympics to finally secure more gold for the U.S. After retiring from figure skating at age 16, then deciding to re-enter the sport, Liu put up a dominant performance in the Milan Games — adding a second gold medal to her collection after also helping win the team event.\n\nLiu, who was also the 2025 World Champion and two-time U.S. champion, had once been the youngest-ever U.S. women's national champion at age 13.

As long as the Mariners stay healthy on the mound, they’ll be one of the better teams in baseball.\n\nOffensively speaking, while the Mariners aren’t in a bad spot on that side of the baseball, they could certainly use more, just as every contender. Sports Illustrated’s Ryan Shea believes a way to improve their offense would be in a trade with the Chicago Cubs for a respected infielder.\n\nCubs get: Emerson Hancock, Colt Emerson, Cole Young\n\n“The Mariners would benefit immediately from this trade, as Hoerner would improve their contact rate, infield defense, and baserunning efficiency while stabilizing the top of their lineup. He would likely slot into the No. 2 spot, giving Seattle a dependable table-setter ahead of its power hitters, and his team-friendly contract through 2026 makes him more than just a short-term rental,” he wrote.\n\nHoerner’s elite contact skills, defensive versatility, and other little things he does would only make Seattle better as it searches to get to the top of the baseball world.\n\nThis is the type of trade that would be tough to make, though, as giving up on Hancock, Emerson, and Young certainly comes with risk. Hancock has already shown he can be very good and Young and Emerson are expected to have long and successful careers.\n\nHowever, if the Mariners want to go all in while this staff is this good, it’s not the worst idea to give Hoerner a chance.\n\nChicago Cubs trade pitch moves on from Nico Hoerner in deal with American League contender for three players amid rumors\n\nNew York Yankees trade proposal moves Cam Schlittler, George Lombard Jr, and Spencer Jones for generational award winner\n\nNew York Yankees fans will love Aaron Judge’s slight shot at Brian Cashman\n\nNew York Yankees urged to pair Aaron Judge with Bryce Harper for World Baseball Classic reason\n\nNew York Yankees get excellent injury news on Giancarlo Stanton as Spring Training gets underway\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies almost got bailed out of Nick Castellanos situation by historic team in American League",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies had a decent offseason, but it still feels like more needs to be done.\n\nSearching for ways to add speed and athleticism to a power-heavy roster, it’s possible that Justin Crawford will be that guy. However, Sports Illustrated’s Ryan Shea believes a trade for Boston Red Sox outfielder Jarren Duran could make sense, and it wouldn’t require the Phillies to give up a whole lot.\n\nRed Sox get: Alec Bohm, Jean Cabrera, Brandon Marsh\n\n“The Philadelphia Phillies would be interested in a trade for Jarren Duran because he addresses several roster needs at once. Philadelphia’s lineup has traditionally leaned heavily on power, but it has lacked consistent speed and top-of-the-order athleticism.\n\n“Duran brings both. His ability to steal 20+ bases, score 85–90 runs, and pressure defenses with his speed would diversify an offense that can sometimes become station-to-station. Adding him would also improve outfield range and defensive flexibility, something that becomes especially important in October,” he wrote.\n\nWhile the Phillies have one of the most dangerous lineups in baseball, their offensive approach has also led to a lot of problems due to the lack of speed and inability to put the ball in play. Duran has struck out 160-plus times in each of the last two seasons, so he doesn’t fix that issue.\n\nHowever, Duran’s speed in the lineup could create more run opportunities for Philadelphia’s lineup.\n\nThe Phillies would also be able to get off Bohm.\n\nNew York Yankees trade proposal moves Cam Schlittler, George Lombard Jr, and Spencer Jones for generational award winner\n\nNew York Yankees fans will love Aaron Judge’s slight shot at Brian Cashman\n\nNew York Yankees urged to pair Aaron Judge with Bryce Harper for World Baseball Classic reason\n\nNew York Yankees get excellent injury news on Giancarlo Stanton as Spring Training gets underway\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies almost got bailed out of Nick Castellanos situation by historic team in American League\n\nNew York Yankees almost made a $20 million mistake but decided to sign Paul Goldschmidt instead",

    "fullText": "The football seen in Curitiba wasn't the best, but Corinthians ended Athletico's 100% record in the Brasileirão-2026.\n\nIn a postponed match from the second round of the competition, Timão defeated CAP 1-0 on Thursday night (19).\n\nThe match was played at Arena da Baixada.\n\nNow there are seven victories for the alvinegro, two draws, and one win for Furacão in the last ten duels across all competitions.\n\nThe first big chance of the game came after Bidu committed a penalty on Viveros.\n\nHowever, after some doubt about the taker, Julimar missed the target, sending it wide.\n\nThen Corinthians was more objective at 21', with Garro ending his goal drought.\n\nHe hadn't scored since the last match between the two teams, in September of last year.\n\nFuracão tried to react before the break. But without success.\n\nOdair made CAP more offensive by swapping Chiquetti for Portilla.\n\nThe change had an effect, as Furacão came back strong after the break.\n\nThere was plenty of effort. But a lack of inspiration.\n\nCorinthians had more space for counterattacks.\n\nAnd couldn't find a good opportunity.\n\nThey won thanks to the only accurate shot they managed.\n\nFuracão learned a lesson in precision, as they had only two good chances during the entire second half.\n\nAthletico remains with six points. And now, they are seventh.\n\nMeanwhile, Corinthians reached the same points. And took the sixth place;\n\nBoth will play again in the Brasileirão next Wednesday (25).\n\nCAP will visit Red Bull Bragantino at Cícero de Souza Marques.\n\nMeanwhile, Timão will face Cruzeiro at Mineirão.\n\nBefore that, however, both will have decisive matches in their respective State Championships on Sunday (22).\n\nFuracão will face Londrina at the Arena after a 2-2 draw in the first leg of the Paranaense semifinals.\n\nMeanwhile, the Alvinegro will visit Portuguesa in the quarterfinals of the Paulistão.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "Tuesday was a spectacular day of hockey in the Olympic men’s hockey tournament at the 2026 Olympic Winter Games in Milan/Cortina d’Ampezzo. Three of the four games went to overtime before being decided.\n\nThe hockey was unbelievable, with Canada, the United States, Slovakia and Finland advancing to play in the semifinals on Friday.\n\nHowever, we also saw a historical refereeing blunder that will go into the history books. On a third period goal between the Czechia and Canada with seven minutes and 42 seconds left, the officials completely missed the fact that the Czech Republic had too many men on the ice.\n\nThe goal was scored by Ondrej Palat of the New York Islanders. At the time, the Czechs went up 3-2. The six Czech players on the ice could be seen celebrating the goal. Further footage actually had eight players on the ice!\n\nSome can understand the officials missing the too many men on the ice call. What is even more mind-boggling is the fact the too many men on the ice call was missed by the Canadian players and coaching staff.\n\nThis was a serious lack of engagement from a Canadian perspective with the game itself. Canadian defenseman Drew Doughty had the following comments according to Frank Servalli of Victory+:\n\n“Not a single player, coach knew until after the game. Nobody. Yeah, we talked about it. We’re like, ‘How did that get missed?’ But I mean, we all missed it. It makes sense that the refs could miss it too. S*** happens.”\n\nThe International Ice Hockey Federation and International Olympic Committee would have had a massive problem on their fans if Canada did not come back to win. Nick Suzuki scored the game-tying goal and Mitch Marner had the game-winning goal.\n\nThe answer is yes. They should be fined an undisclosed sum and not be allowed to officiate another game for the rest of the tournament. The officials responsible for the missed call were referees Mikael Holm of Sweden, and Chris Rooney of the United States, and linesmen David Brisebois of Canada and Jonny Murphy of the United States.\n\nThe IIHF and IOC blamed “human error,” but this is one of the calls that should always be made, especially with eight Czech players on the ice!\n\nOLYMPICS: USA figure skater Isabeau Levito gushes over Olympic Village\n\nNFL: Tyreek Hill makes hilarious first move after Dolphins release\n\nCBB: 2026 college basketball rankings, updated AP Top 25 after Week 15\n\nMLB: Tigers infielder from Taiwan apologizes to Koreans after trash talk goes viral\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: College Hall of Famer, father of Chicago Bulls coach, dies\n\nVIRAL: Chloe Kim ‘obsessed’ with $100k gift from NFL star Myles Garrett after Olympics\n\nThe post Officials make massive mistake in men’s quarterfinal game in Olympic hockey tournament appeared first on The Big Lead.",

Cactus League play is just around the corner for the Boys in Blue.\n\nAs we await the joy of getting to see World Series MVP Yoshinobu Yamamoto return to the mound on Saturday, here are some of the top headlines from around Major League Baseball.\n\nThe reigning back-to-back National League manager of the year was rewarded by the team on Thursday.\n\nThe Milwaukee Brewers gave Pat Murphy a three-year extension, ESPN reports.\n\nIn addition to the three years — 2026 through 2028 — the deal also includes a club option for 2029, Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic reports.\n\nThe trial of Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz, who are accused of tipping pitches to bettors in exchange for kickbacks, is likely to move to the fall, Zack Meisel of The Athletic reports.\n\nBoth have pleaded not guilty and are free on bail, though they are on the MLB’s restricted list.\n\nThey were scheduled to have their trial begin in May, though Judge Kiyo A. Matsumoto “suggested she’ll ultimately shift the date to the fall,” Meisel wrote.\n\nThose involved were ordered to submit their preferred new trial date by Monday.\n\nIf October is indeed the new trial date, it will be interesting to see if the legal proceedings overlap with the World Series.\n\nInfielder Jazz Chisholm Jr. has made public his intentions to join Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani in an exclusive club that was empty until last season and now only includes the Japanese two-way player.\n\nChisholm told Chris Kirschner of The Athletic that he wants to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in a season, which was done for the first time in history by Ohtani just last year.\n\n“Reminded that 50-50 has been accomplished just once in MLB history, he shrugged,” Kirschner wrote. “’You’re looking at the second one,’ Chisholm said.”\n\nThe quest may seem nearly impossible, but Yankees teammate Aaron Judge expressed confidence to Kirschner.\n\n“He really can accomplish anything,” Judge said.",

    "fullText": "Sean Strickland has established himself as a man who demands media attention each time he speaks, though often not for the right reasons.\n\nThe UFC's move to Paramount has added benefits for fighters and fans alike, with a value boost in athlete bonuses for good performances, while supporters can tune in for $8.99 per month, a portion of the previous cost. But less than two months into their deal, Paramount is facing backlash after Strickland presented one of his infamous tirades during fight week.\n\nThe former UFC middleweight champion is in contention to compete for another title should he win his next outing, but that hasn't stopped him from being his old self. Strickland only had the center stage for a couple of minutes before discrediting Paramount.\n\n\"Yeah, no, f*** Paramount, man,\" Strickland said in protest against the new home of the UFC. \"It's real quiet today. I like it, man. You've got to like lose fights more often. It's going back to the Apex here with you guys. It's real quiet. No one's here. Is that like a bad sign for the MMA world or is it just this card?\"\n\nContinuing his attack on Paramount, Strickland blamed them for ruining a childhood passion of his.\n\n\"Paramount's cool,\" Strickland continued. \"I mean, they f***ing ruined Halo, but other than that, you know. They made it gay. Other than f***ing ruining like a childhood memory and legend to me, I mean, Paramount's cool.\"\n\n\"We don't make more money, but you know.\"\n\nAs the mixed martial arts world has become accustomed to, Sean Strickland is never too far away from damaging his image with wild remarks.\n\nHis appearance at UFC Houston media day had several controversial moments, but arguably none worse than the comments about Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny, who was honored with the Super Bowl LX halftime show headlining spot.\n\n\"I mean, look at the NFL, dude,\" Strickland said. \"You had that, I don't even want to say the fa**ots name because it's just like, what?... The Puerto Rican, right? Yeah, that f***ing fa**ot.\"\n\n\"Like, dude, it is so crazy that this is America now. Like, back in the day, dude, the NFL was like, the NFL was the f***ing standard of being a f***ing man. And now every f***ing year, the NFL, I think they all get together around a table and say, 'You know what, guys? How do we f***ing ruin this sport? How do we gay it up? How do we f***ing ruin it?' Well, I'll tell you what. Why don't we bring a gay foreigner who doesn't speak f***ing English and have him perform it?\"\n\n\"Like, get the f***. And then you have like, yeah, dude. It's like, the NFL is f***ing pathetic these days. So, even like the NFL players probably f***ing hate it. No, NFL's gay. I think we'd all agree that the NFL got real gay lately...\"\n\nThe aftermath of Sean Strickland's words has not been pretty. Not only have fans demanded that the UFC remove Strickland from any media obligations, while others are calling for his contract to be terminated, but the Paramount network has also been pushed to answer some uncomfortable questions.\n\nAccording to reports, many fans and media outlets have begun pressuring Paramount to respond to Strickland's vulgar comments. Homophobia and sexism persist anytime the UFC fighter is placed in front of a camera.\n\nThe public outrage may be justified, but Dana White will always promote free speech among those working in any of his business ventures. White's willingness to accept any comment is considered positive by some, but concerns are beginning to plague him and Paramount for allowing sensitive topics to be ridiculed.\n\n🚨 Paramount are now facing pressure from the media to address Sean Strickland publicly calling Bad Bunny a “f****t” and making sexist comments\n\nStrickland’s comments are now receiving coverage from @Variety who have contacted Paramount reps for comment, to no response yet pic.twitter.com/QMjLl0eXvY\n\n— ACD MMA (@acdmma_) February 19, 2026",

    "fullText": "Freddie Freeman said wants to play baseball for four more seasons before retiring, and he wants to spend those final years with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Freeman will be 40 years old in four seasons.\n\nThe Dodgers are currently in spring training and will have its first game against the Los Angeles Angels on Saturday at Camelback Ranch. Freeman, who has two years remaining on the six-year, $162 million contract he signed with the Dodgers in 2022, spoke to reporters about his retirement plans on Thursday.\n\nFreeman said he loves Los Angeles and wants to finish his career there. In order to play until he is 40, he will need to sign another contract. Although he hopes to re-sign with the Dodgers, Freeman said he will not ask for a new contract but will return if the franchise wants him.\n\n“It’s out of my control. I’m not worried about another contract, I’m not going to bring it up, not going to talk about it,” Freeman told reporters. “I’ve got two years left. I’m just an employee. I just do my job, and if they want me back, they want me back. But I think Andrew (Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman) and everyone knows I love being here.”\n\nFreddie Freeman says he wants to finish his career with the Dodgers. That would require a new contract at some point:\n\n\"I love being here. I'm from Southern California. I've had a great time with the fans I've got two years left, but Andrew and everyone knows I love being here.\" pic.twitter.com/wFUnlxyq3o\n\n— Doug McKain (@DMAC_LA) February 19, 2026\n\nFreeman has already accomplish a lot throughout his 16-season career in MLB. He has won three World Series championships, including back-to-back titles with the Dodgers in 2024 and 2025. In the 2024 World Series, he was named the World Series Most Valuable Player.\n\nAs an individual, Freeman is a nine-time NL All-Star, three-time NL Silver Slugger and was the 2020 NL Most Valuable Player while playing for the Atlanta Braves.\n\nFreeman said he would like to reach 3,000 career hits before retiring. He currently has 2,179 career hits, which is the most for any active MLB player. If he is able to hit the 3,000-hit mark, he will join an exclusive group of 33 former players who have recorded at least 3,000 hits in MLB history.\n\nThe most recent addition to the 3,000-hits club was Detroit Tigers first baseman Miguel Cabrera in April 2022. Cabrera retired from MLB in 2023.\n\nThe post Freddie Freeman Says He Wants to Finish His Career With the Dodgers appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "description": "Walmart has steadily gained share from households earning over $100,000 who come for the savings and stay for the convenience — and AI is helping.",
    "fullText": "Walmart's former side hustle is getting serious.\n\nThe retail giant reported that 2025 was its first full year of profitability in its e-commerce operations, which started — as most ventures do — needing time and money to get rolling.\n\n\"We've far surpassed the breakeven level,\" CFO John David Rainey said of the e-commerce business in the company's fourth quarter earnings call Thursday. \"The momentum is only upward from here.\"\n\nThe bet is paying off thanks in large part to the addition of higher-income shoppers, who Walmart said are attracted to its combination of low prices and increasing convenience.\n\n\"The majority of our share gains came from households making more than $100,000,\" CEO John Furner said on the earnings call.\n\nThe company said high-earning households have responded favorably to Walmart's online and in-app offerings, from ordering their weekly groceries to picking out stylish new outfits, as has been the case for several quarters now.\n\nFor the fiscal year, Walmart's overall sales grew 4.7% to $713.2 billion, with e-commerce increasing by nearly 25% to top $150 billion.\n\nDespite Walmart's growth, e-commerce giant Amazon dethroned it as the world's largest company by revenue last year with $716.9 billion in revenue. The stock dipped immediately after the earnings report but recovered during trading on Thursday.\n\nBut Walmart's progress in e-commerce could give Amazon a run for its money, thanks to its physical proximity to 95% of US households.\n\n\"Stores are a huge part of the solution to deliver the customer experiences that the customers are looking for,\" CEO John Furner said on the call. \"Having the US with 5,200 locations between Walmart and Sam's, where inventory is forward-deployed, is really helpful.\"\n\nAmazon, for its part, is working hard to counter Walmart's dominant physical presence, which so far has given it an edge in delivering items like groceries and everyday essentials in an hour or less.\n\nIt's not just fresh food delivery that's helping Walmart reach new shoppers. Rainey said shoppers are using some of the savings from groceries to try new items from other categories.\n\n\"It's not just convenience,\" Rainey said. \"I'd argue fashion is not really a convenience item. It shows that our broader assortment is appealing to a much larger customer base.\"\n\nFashion not only led sales growth in general merchandise in the US, Rainey said, but on-trend styles are also helping draw in more of these high-income households, who wind up sticking around.\n\n\"They're coming to Walmart, in many cases, some of them for the first time, and they're enjoying an experience that makes them want to come back these platforms,\" he said.\n\nGlobalData retail analyst Neil Saunders said his firm's data also shows wealthy households increasingly choosing Walmart for more than groceries, thanks to its expanded assortment and in-store experiences.\n\nIt's still too soon to see the impact of Walmart's recent AI partnerships, but Furner says the early results promise to turbocharge sales online and in-app. He said the company's in-house shopping assistant bot, Sparky, has led to 35% larger transaction totals.\n\n\"Roughly half of our app users have used Sparky, and when they use Sparky, it drives them to build bigger baskets,\" US segment CEO David Guggina said.\n\nWalmart still has a long road ahead to catch Amazon's online sales, but the past year has shown that it now has a powerful engine to get there.",

    "title": "Netflix's co-CEO says Trump has one big question about the Warner Bros. sale",
    "description": "Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos says President Donald Trump has spoken about wanting to bring jobs back to Hollywood after years of lower production.",
    "fullText": "Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos says President Donald Trump is all business as the Department of Justice weighs the streaming giant's potential acquisition of Warner Bros.\n\n\"The only thing we talk about is how to keep jobs in America, how to keep the production industry healthy,\" Sarandos said of his talks with Trump during an appearance on Puck's \"The Town\" podcast.\n\nTrump \"wants to know what happened in California,\" Sarandos said in the podcast episode, referencing the state's film and TV production decline.\n\nHollywood has increasingly gone outside Los Angeles to make movies and shows in recent years, lured by tax credits in places ranging from Atlanta to the United Kingdom.\n\nOn-location shooting days for movies and TV shows in the LA area fell 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to a study from FilmLA Research published in mid-January. This production drop has hurt LA's creative community.\n\nTrump previously floated the idea of imposing tariffs on movies and shows made outside the US, though it's unclear how an import tax could apply to creative services.\n\nNetflix has been on a charm campaign to convince the president and Hollywood that it would be a better buyer of Warner Bros. than rival bidder Paramount Skydance.\n\nA key part of Netflix's pitch is that it would cut fewer jobs than Paramount. Paramount has said it's planning to create $6 billion in so-called synergies, which would likely include layoffs, while Netflix has told investors it's aiming for $2 billion to $3 billion in cost cuts, in part by saving money on licensing programming.\n\nWBD's board of directors seems sympathetic to Netflix's argument. The board warned shareholders that if it accepted Paramount's offer, there could be an exodus of employees seeking to avoid layoffs.\n\nAntitrust analysis often focuses on how strong a company is relative to its competitors and how the market power it could wield over consumers. Regulators also look at how a merger or acquisition would impact the production side, which in this case would be how many studios are competing to buy new movies or shows.\n\nParamount has argued that Netflix, the largest paid streaming service with over 325 million subscribers, would become too powerful if it bought the Warner Bros. studio and HBO assets. Netflix has downplayed those concerns, saying that it also competes against YouTube and traditional TV for attention.\n\nTrump said in December that Netflix had a \"very big market share\" so buying Warner Bros. \"could be a problem.\" However, the president said in early February that he had decided he \"shouldn't be involved\" and would defer to his Department of Justice.\n\n\"We do not discuss private conversations that may or may not have happened, but President Trump has great relationships with all parties in this potential transaction and remains neutral in this process with no preference for either bidder,\" a White House official told Business Insider.\n\nNetflix's co-CEO said Trump hadn't asked him for political concessions relating to the Warner Bros deal.\n\n\"We're not talking about doing anybody any favors or anything else,\" Sarandos said.\n\nSarandos has long donated to Democrats, and Netflix is often seen by Republicans as a left-leaning company, as evidenced by the grilling Sarandos got during his visit to Capitol Hill in early February.\n\nNotably, Paramount is run by David Ellison and is financially backed by his father, Larry Ellison, a mega-billionaire who has long supported Trump. The younger Ellison has also built rapport with Trump, as the president said last year that Paramount's CEO was \"great\" and would \"do a great job\" running the Hollywood institution.\n\nIf Trump doesn't pick a side, however, those relationships may not help the Ellisons win the battle for Warner Bros.",

    "description": "When I booked my first solo trip for my birthday, I felt nervous about celebrating all on my own. I surprised myself by having an amazing time.",
    "fullText": "I'm a girl who loves her independence. Although I'm a proud extrovert, I live on my own, I like being able to get in my car and drive wherever I want, and I enjoy a good solo date.\n\nAs comfortable as I am doing things alone, though, I still prefer to celebrate really special moments with my loved ones. One of those moments is my birthday.\n\nUnfortunately, in the weeks leading up to my 29th birthday, the stars weren't exactly aligning in my favor. Friends either already had their schedules booked, were tied up with other responsibilities, or just didn't respond when I asked if they were free.\n\nI understand life is busy, but I did feel a bit sad that no one showed a lot of interest in celebrating with me. Still, one thing I'm trying to learn as I get older is that I can't press pause on my happiness just because other people aren't available.\n\nInstead, I booked my very first solo trip to an all-inclusive resort in Cancún, and it ended up being exactly what I needed.\n\nShortly after I landed in Mexico, it hit me that it was my first time traveling outside the US in 24 years — and if you've done the math, that last time was when I was 5 years old.\n\nSimple things like going through immigration at the airport or communicating with my driver in limited Spanish felt very new to me.\n\nWhen I checked in at the resort, the gentleman helping me noticed that I'd listed my birthday as the reason for my reservation. The lady standing at the counter next to me overheard the exchange and asked if I was here on my own.\n\nAfter I said yes, she told me how brave I was to celebrate alone, adding that she would never be able to do that.\n\nHours later, I made my way to dinner at the Mexican restaurant they had on the property — I couldn't wait to take a bite of the chicken fajitas and tres leches cake I saw on the menu. When I got there and requested a table for one, though, I remember the hostess asking, \"Oh really, it's just you?\"\n\nI know she didn't mean any harm, but I started feeling a little self-conscious. Was this all a mistake?\n\nHowever, by the time my order arrived, I was so happy just to eat the yummy food in front of me and admire the sounds of the waterfall in the nearby courtyard that I wasn't really concerned about what other people may have been thinking.\n\nAfter all, I told myself, most people on vacation are probably too preoccupied enjoying themselves to judge anyone else.\n\nBeing on a group trip means you often have to take into consideration several other people's opinions about what to eat, where to go, when to rest … the list goes on.\n\nThe nice thing about being at an all-inclusive alone, though, was that my trip was already somewhat planned. I just got to sit back and handpick the things I actually wanted to do — without any compromises.\n\nSleep in until noon? Sure. Order room service in the middle of the night? Go for it. Attend the morning sip-and-paint class? Check.\n\nIf I wanted to spontaneously take a dip in the ocean even after straightening my hair and putting on a full face of makeup, I could, and no one would stop me.\n\nI did all of these absolutely guilt-free, because I wasn't responsible for anyone else and nobody was waiting on me, either.\n\nGoing on my first major solo trip made me realize I hadn't been prioritizing all my needs.\n\nEven though I really enjoy getting dressed up, I hadn't been putting much time into my appearance, mainly because I work from home and not many people see me throughout the day.\n\nSince it was my birthday week, I made an extra effort to feel pretty, and it instantly uplifted my mood.\n\nI'm also always wishing for more time in my day to read. Although I've historically been a nonfiction reader, I forced myself to bring two romance novels on this vacation as a reminder that I'm allowed to read purely for fun.\n\nI finished reading both books over the six days I was there, and have kept up the habit since returning home.\n\nOverall, this was the first time in a long time I felt confident in living my life as I pleased, without worrying about anyone else's thoughts or concerns.\n\nI love the rain, and on the day of my birthday, there was a short thunderstorm. I felt a sense of childlike joy as I jumped into the lazy river while it was pouring outside.\n\nWhat started as a vacation I was really nervous about turned into the trip I was most sad to leave. Traveling solo on my birthday filled my cup and desperately gave me the rest I needed.\n\nMost of all, it also reminded me to do more things that bring me joy, even if they're scary at first. I came back to California feeling more confident and empowered than ever.\n\nAnd who knows? My 30th birthday is right around the corner, so maybe I'll do it all over again. I think Europe's calling my name.",

    "description": "\"House of the Dragon\" season 3 premieres in June. The first trailer promises plenty of action and bloody battles to come.",
    "fullText": "HBO was betting big on the success of \"House of the Dragon\" long before the season two finale.\n\nThe network renewed the Targaryen-centric \"Game of Thrones\" prequel for another round ahead of the second season premiere in June 2024. Francesca Orsi, HBO's head of drama, praised the team behind the hit fantasy series in the renewal announcement, including author George R. R. Martin and showrunner Ryan Condal.\n\n\"George, Ryan, and the rest of our incredible executive producers, cast, and crew, have reached new heights with the phenomenal second season of 'House of the Dragon,'\" Orsi said in a press release. \"We are in awe of the dragon-sized effort the entire team has put into the creation of a spectacular season two, with a scope and scale that is only rivaled by its heart.\"\n\nAlthough Martin has since stepped back from \"House of the Dragon,\" season three will continue to adapt his fictional history book about House Targaryen, \"Fire & Blood,\" and the civil war known in Westerosi lore as the Dance of the Dragons.\n\nHere's everything we know about season three.\n\nA teaser trailer for \"House of the Dragon\" season three was released on Thursday, days before the first season finale of HBO's newest hit prequel, \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.\"\n\nThe teaser indicates that \"House of the Dragon\" will return in June 2026, though HBO has not set a specific premiere date.\n\nBack in March 2025, once production had officially commenced in the UK, Condal attributed the multi-year gap between seasons to the intricate storyline and the show's budget.\n\n\"There's been no television show in history that ever said, 'We have too much money and too much time to make this,'\" Condal told Entertainment Weekly. \"You're always making decisions as you go along as to, how are we going to use the resources we have right now to tell the best story we can possibly tell? But I appreciate everybody's patience.\"\n\n\"House of the Dragon\" veterans Clare Kilner, Andrij Parekh, and Loni Peristere will return to direct the new eight-episode arc, per EW. They'll be joined by Nina Lopez-Corrado.\n\nThe central conflict in \"House of the Dragon\" is between Rhaenyra Targaryen, the eldest child and chosen heir of the late King Viserys, and her half-brother, Aegon II Targaryen, the late king's eldest son. Fans colloquially refer to the warring siblings and their factions as \"the blacks\" and \"the greens,\" respectively.\n\nAt the end of season two, viewers saw Aegon flee from King's Landing while his mother, Alicent Hightower, secretly colluded with Rhaenyra to give her the Iron Throne.\n\nThe season three teaser offers a glimpse into how this alliance will be received. Although Rhaenyra trusts that Alicent will keep her word to surrender, Rhaenyra's eldest son, Jace, seems to dissuade her from the plan. Meanwhile, Alicent returns to King's Landing to find her second son, Aemond, sitting on the Iron Throne in Aegon's absence.\n\n\"The king has abdicated the throne,\" Aemond says in a voiceover. \"A new dawn is coming. A new line of unsullied kings.\"\n\nHowever, Alicent appears prepared to keep her word, especially knowing that Rhaenyra has recruited a group of Targaryen bastards as dragon riders. Alicent knows the greens are outnumbered, especially with Aegon missing and her daughter, Helaena, unwilling to ride her dragon into battle. It's likely that Rhaenyra will become queen, with or without a surrender.\n\n\"Soon or late, Rhaenyra will send her new dragons here,\" Alicent says in the teaser. \"It would be the end.\"\n\nWe can't say for certain what the season three plot will entail, but there's at least one big battle on the horizon: the Battle of the Gullet.\n\nWhile speaking to EW, Condal promised that season three would cover \"four major events\" from the source material, including the pivotal naval assault known as the Battle of the Gullet, which demands significant production resources. And to the fans who have been begging for more action, rest assured: Condal guaranteed plenty of bloodshed.\n\n\"In many ways, the Gullet has been on the minds of the production for about three years now and trying to figure out how we were going to mount it in a way that was both producible and exciting, thrilling,\" Condal told EW.\n\n\"I would like to think that this is probably the most complex sequence that's ever been done for television,\" he continued, \"not necessarily the most expensive or the longest shoot or anything like that, but just based on the number of moving pieces, the amount of different disciplines, media that have to be blended together to achieve success because you're talking about sea and ships and dragons and action.\"\n\nAs for the other three \"major events\" that Condal promised, there are plenty of historic showdowns, character debuts, and prophesied downfalls that we can predict will occur in season three based on what happens in the book, some of which have already been teased in the show. (\"Fire & Blood\" spoilers ahead!)\n\nThese include Rhaenyra taking over King's Landing; Alicent's youngest son, Daeron, finally entering the narrative; and the deaths of both Aemond and Rhaenyra's husband, Daemon. However, \"House of the Dragon\" has begun to make some bold adaptation choices — so anything could be on the horizon.\n\n\"We're cresting that narrative parabola here and starting to come down into, if not the endgame, the midpoint and getting into the late Act 2 and moving onto the start of Act 3,\" Condal told EW. \"Anybody that's read that book knows that the narrative gets bigger and grimmer as it goes along, and the show has to match that ambition as best it possibly can.\"\n\nIf you want a preview of what's ahead, though, you can pick up \"Fire & Blood\" yourself. You'll probably want to start somewhere in the chapter \"The Dying of the Dragons: The Red Dragon and the Gold\" to catch up on season two and read ahead for what may be to come.\n\nA press release from HBO confirmed the show's big players — among them Emma D'Arcy (Rhaenyra Targaryen), Olivia Cooke (Alicent Hightower), Matt Smith (Daemon Targaryen), Steve Toussaint (Corlys Velaryon), Ewan Mitchell (Aemond Targaryen), Tom Glynn-Carney (Aegon II Targaryen), Harry Collett (Jacaerys Velaryon), Bethany Antonia (Baela Targaryen), Phoebe Campbell (Rhaena Targaryen), Phia Saban (Helaena Targaryen), Sonoya Mizuno (Mysaria), Rhys Ifans (Otto Hightower), and Fabien Frankel (Ser Criston Cole) — will all return for season three.\n\nAs for newcomers, \"Gladiator\" star Tommy Flanagan has been cast as Ser Roderick Dustin, known as \"Roddy the Ruin\" in the book, while \"A Complete Unknown\" actor Dan Fogler will play Torrhen Manderly. Both characters are formidable knights from the North, where House Stark rules.\n\nFarther south, James Norton will make his \"HOTD\" debut as Ormund Hightower, Alicent's cousin and Lord of Oldtown. The season two finale shows a glimpse of Ormund's army marching to counter Rhaenyra's forces accompanied by Daeron and his dragon Tessarion.\n\nOther casting decisions have yet to be publicized. Chief among them is Daeron himself, who was sent away at a young age to squire for Ormund at Oldtown.\n\nCondal confirmed to EW that Daeron will show up soon, but declined to say who will play him.\n\n\"He's a big feature in the book, but if you read the book narrative sequentially, the material we've covered so far didn't really have a lot of call for Daeron in it, which is why we're getting to this now,\" Condal explained.\n\nThere's also the matter of Nettles, a character from \"Fire & Blood\" who claims the dragon Sheepstealer. In the season two finale of \"House of the Dragon,\" Rhaena finally comes across what we presume is the dragon Sheepstealer — but it remains to be seen if she successfully claims the dragon and takes over that storyline, or if Nettles will still appear.\n\nAegon, also known as Aegon the Elder to book readers, suffers near-fatal injuries during season two's battle at Rook's Rest, leaving him mostly immobile.\n\nIn the season two finale, Lord Larys Strong arranges for Aegon to covertly escape King's Landing in anticipation of Rhaenyra's imminent coup. Of all the finale's open-ended questions, Aegon's future seems most uncertain.\n\nThe details of Aegon's period of exile are similarly murky in \"Fire & Blood\" — but don't expect him to disappear from the screen. Condal confirmed that the disgraced king will remain \"a big, big part of the show.\"\n\n\"He's kind of lost to history in the sense that nobody really knows what happened,\" Condal told EW. \"We took that, as the writers, as a great opportunity to figure out. That was one of the great challenges of writing season two: figuring out something that would work and be satisfying, but also not cause ripple effects in the narrative and change where the other big pieces are going. Honestly, I think it's one of the best stories that we cracked this year.\"\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider, Glynn-Carney also teased a revenge-fueled journey for Aegon in season three.\n\n\"Even though his physicality has changed now, I don't particularly think for him, in terms of how unpredictable and how volatile he is — I don't think that's going to change at all,\" the actor said. \"If anything, there will be more. So I'm really looking forward to getting back on season three, and taking him on this next chapter of his journey and really pushing the boundaries even more with him this time.\"\n\nNope! HBO has already confirmed that \"House of the Dragon\" will return for a fourth and final season.\n\nA four-season arc has seemed like the plan for a while. Martin said on his personal blog in October 2022 that he couldn't see \"House of the Dragon\" covering the entire Dance of the Dragons in fewer than four seasons.\n\nMartin has since criticized Condal and HBO for ignoring his objections while writing season three, particularly regarding changes to the source material.\n\n\"What I would say is George introduced us to Ryan as the person that he thought would be the best to create 'House the Dragon,'\" HBO chief Casey Bloys told Deadline. \"And I will say Ryan has been an excellent showrunner and a really great partner and collaborator, so we embrace his vision and his creative choices, or we wouldn't have done it.\"\n\nBloys said that Martin has been focused instead on \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" — aka the \"Tales of Dunk and Egg\" adaptation — on which he's credited as a co-creator and co-executive producer alongside showrunner Ira Parker.\n\n\"The idea that he is going to agree with every creator or showrunner that is either developing or producing, two artists are not always going to agree,\" Bloys added of Martin. \"So, some of this comes with the territory.\"\n\nPalmer Haasch and Caralynn Matassa contributed to an earlier version of this story.",

    "description": "Beale Infrastructure is proposing a data center in Claremore, Oklahoma, a town of about 20,000. Over a hundred locals met to discuss the plans this week.",
    "fullText": "Applause broke out during an Oklahoma man's speech at a city council meeting on Tuesday to discuss a proposed data center. A minute later, shouts of disbelief rang out across the room.\n\n\"Disgusting!\" one woman shouted as Claremore Police Department officers handcuffed and escorted Daniel Blanchard out of the room.\n\nAuthorities said they arrested Blanchard, whose speech exceeded the three-minute time limit, for trespassing.\n\nOver 100 people, including Blanchard, had gathered in a ballroom at Rogers State University in Claremore to voice their opinions about the large data center project. The developer, Beale Infrastructure, is proposing a campus in the Claremore Industrial Park that includes data centers, supporting infrastructure, and office space.\n\nBlanchard was among the residents who opted to speak during the public comment portion, which limits each person to three minutes. In his speech, Blanchard spoke about what he considered compliance issues related to the potential data centers.\n\n\"The Claremore Industrial Economic Development Authority has a fiduciary responsibility to the public, not to build infrastructure. And this act of overreach is putting the health and safety of members of this community at risk,\" he said.\n\nAI is driving a data center construction boom across the United States. While companies like OpenAI argue that building new data centers will reindustrialize the US economy and create jobs, residents of towns where developers are proposing new data centers worry about their impact on power grids, water resources, pollution, and overall quality of life.\n\nIn an investigation published in September, Business Insider reported that over 1,200 data centers had already been built or were approved for construction across the country.\n\nThe proposed data center in Claremore, a suburban hub of Tulsa home to about 20,000 people, has divided the town. During the three-hour meeting on Tuesday evening, dozens of residents spoke both in favor and against the project.\n\nBlanchard exceeded his three minutes by about 30 seconds before police officers approached him. He gathered his notes and calmly followed the officers to the front of the hall, where town officials were sitting.\n\nIn a video of the meeting posted by the town on its YouTube channel, Blanchard appears to hand his notes to a council member. At that point, police arrested Blanchard, placing him in handcuffs. The crowd hollered in shock.\n\nIn a statement, the Claremore Police Department said officers aren't responsible for enforcing city council rules and only become involved in city council meetings when an official orders them to remove an individual.\n\n\"The man's position on the issues, what he said, or his unwillingness to follow rules of the meeting played no part in the officer's decision to arrest him,\" the statement said. \"He was arrested for trespassing in compliance with the law and with the hope of restoring order to an important meeting.\"\n\nA local politician fighting the data center project posted to X on Wednesday that Blanchard has been released from jail. The next council meeting is scheduled for March 2.",

    "title": "A timeline of former Prince Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell's friendship shows they often traveled and partied together",
    "description": "Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was arrested Thursday, previously said Ghislaine Maxwell introduced him to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "fullText": "Many unanswered questions remain about the relationship between Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor — formerly Prince Andrew — and Jeffrey Epstein, but the former royal once said they were introduced by Ghislaine Maxwell.\n\nMaxwell, the British socialite who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for sex-trafficking underage girls for Epstein after pleading not guilty, and Mountbatten-Windsor are understood to have enjoyed a close friendship in the '90s and early 2000s, when they were regularly spotted together on the New York and London social scenes.\n\nTwo sources who were interviewed for the 2022 ITV documentary \"Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and the Paedophile\" said that Mountbatten-Windsor and Maxwell were so close that Buckingham Palace staff believed they dated at one point in the early aughts.\n\nIt was also in the early 2000s that Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre alleges Epstein and Maxwell made her sleep with the then-prince on multiple occasions when she was 17.\n\nGiuffre, who died by suicide in April 2025, sued Mountbatten-Windsor in 2021 over allegations he sexually assaulted her at Maxwell's London home, at Epstein's New York home, and on Epstein's private island.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor has long denied the allegations, saying he doesn't recall ever meeting Giuffre. Still, in 2022, they reached a settlement for an undisclosed amount. He has also been stripped of his royal patronages and military and royal titles.\n\nOn Thursday, he was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office amid renewed scrutiny over his relationship with Epstein.\n\nHe has long been tied to Epstein through his friendship with Maxwell. Here's a timeline of their friendship as documented in news reports and interviews over the years.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor said in his infamous November 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight that he'd known Maxwell since her university days.\n\nMaxwell attended Oxford University, graduating in 1985, during which Mountbatten-Windsor was serving in the Royal Navy.\n\nMaxwell also came from a well-connected family. Her father, Robert Maxwell, was the owner of the Daily Mirror newspaper and a onetime member of Parliament before his death in 1991.\n\nMaxwell and Mountbatten-Windsor seemed especially close in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when their outings on the New York and London social scene were widely covered in the press, and the friends were often pictured together.\n\nMaxwell and Epstein were believed to be dating at some point during this era. At Maxwell's child-sex-trafficking trial in 2021, Cimberly Espinosa testified that she worked at Epstein's company from 1996 to 2002, largely as Maxwell's executive assistant. Espinosa said that when she first started at the company, she believed Epstein and Maxwell were dating, but she got the impression they broke up sometime in the last two years of her employment at J. Epstein and Co.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor and Maxwell may have started dating around 2001, according to Paul Page, a former royal protection officer who spoke for the ITV documentary.\n\nPage said he first met Maxwell in 2001, and that Buckingham Palace staff suspected Mountbatten-Windsor and Maxwell had an \"intimate relationship\" by the frequency of her visits.\n\n\"From the way she was allowed to enter and exit the palace, at will, we realized … suspected that she may have had an intimate relationship with Prince Andrew,\" Page said. \"A colleague of mine remembered her coming in four times in one day from the morning till the evening — she kept coming in and out, in and out.\"\n\nAnother source who spoke on the program was Euan Rellie, a banker who said he also became friendly with Maxwell during university.\n\n\"I got the sense that Prince Andrew and Ghislaine had probably been girlfriend and boyfriend in the past,\" Rellie said in the documentary, according to the Telegraph. \"They had an easy warmth around each other.\"\n\nAt the time of the documentary's release, Prince Andrew's press office did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the claims.\n\nOn Thursday, Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office. He was released hours later, and police said an investigation is ongoing.\n\nEarlier this month, following the release of documents from the US Justice Department's Investigation into Epstein, the UK's Thames Valley Police said it was looking into claims that Mountbatten-Windsor shared confidential trade reports with Epstein in 2010, when Mountbatten-Windsor was a trade envoy.\n\nHe has previously denied all allegations against him. In a 2019 statement, he said, \"At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.\"\n\nMountbatten-Windsor has not commented publicly on the recent allegations of misconduct in office.\n\nHours after the arrest on Thursday, King Charles, Mountbatten-Windsor's brother, released a statement saying, \"The law must take its course.\"\n\nIn their own statement, the family of Virginia Giuffre said, \"Today, our broken hearts have been lifted by the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty.\"\n\nEditor's note: A version of this story was previously published in June 2022. It was updated in February 2026.",

    "fullText": "World Liberty Financial, the crypto firm cofounded and partly run by the Trump family, will tokenize loan revenue interest from a new Trump International Hotel and Resort in the Maldives.\n\nTokenization is the process of putting an asset on the blockchain to turn it into a crypto token that can be easily traded, in this case, a loan used to fund the construction of a hotel. Investors who buy tokenized pieces of the loan will be entitled to a portion of the interest payments made on it.\n\nAccording to WLF documents, DT Marks DEFI LLC, which is owned by the Trump family, reserves the right to receive 75% of the revenue generated from $WFLI token sales after expenses.\n\nThe offering won't be available to everyone. Only accredited investors, or those with at least $1 million in liquid assets and who make enough money per year, will be given access to the tokenized loan. The tokens will be offered in partnership with Securitize, Inc. and Dar Global PLC.\n\nThe Trump hotel in the Maldives is set to open in 2030 and was announced in late 2025.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is listed as \"Cofounder Emeritus\" of World Liberty Financial on its website. His three sons — Don Jr., Eric, and Baron — are listed as cofounders, as is Steve Witkoff, who is currently serving as United States special envoy to the Middle East.\n\nWorld Liberty Financial's new tokenization offering is the Trump family's latest move in the crypto space. In January 2025, Trump launched $Trump coin, a meme token that spiked to $45 shortly after launch, and currently trades at $3.40. According to Reuters, the coin made almost $100 million in fees in the first couple weeks after its launch.\n\nWLF also sold a 49% stake in January 2025 to an Emirati royal for $500 million, the Wall Street Journal reported. The firm launched a stablecoin, USD1, last March.\n\nIn addition, Trump Media and Technology Group adopted a crypto treasury strategy last year, buying billions of dollars in bitcoin. According to a Bloomberg report, crypto had boosted the Trump family's net worth by $1.4 billion as of January 2026.\n\nThe token offering from WLF comes as crypto assets endure a brutal bear market as funds flee the space. Bitcoin's price is down 45% from October's high, while ethereum has fallen 59% since August.",

    "description": "Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office. Here's a timeline of his ties to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "fullText": "A member of the royal family was arrested at Sandringham Estate on Thursday morning.\n\nAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, was arrested at the royal home on suspicion of misconduct in public office related to his ties to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nKing Charles said in a statement of the arrest that \"the law must take its course\" and that the authorities had the royal family's \"full and wholehearted support and co-operation.\"\n\nMountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied any involvement with Epstein's sex-trafficking crimes. However, his relationship with Epstein has been under scrutiny for over a decade, as Virginia Giuffre named him in a lawsuit she filed against Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2015.\n\nThat scrutiny only intensified after the recent release of documents in the Epstein files. According to emails released, the former prince appeared to forward reports related to his work as UK trade envoy to Epstein in 2010 and 2011.\n\nHere's a timeline of Mountbatten-Windsor's connection to Epstein.\n\nAs the BBC reported, Ghislaine Maxwell introduced Epstein to Mountbatten-Windsor in 1999.\n\nThe trio remained friends throughout the early 2000s, with Epstein and Maxwell attending parties at Windsor Castle and Sandringham. The three were also photographed together at events, including a 2000 party at Mar-a-Lago with Donald and Melania Trump and the 2000 Royal Ascot. Epstein and Maxwell were also photographed at Princess Beatrice's 18th birthday party in July 2006, the BBC reported.\n\nIn 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18, and was sentenced to 18 months. Mountbatten-Windsor visited Epstein in New York in December 2010, just four months after Epstein's release.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor said it was a \"mistake and an error\" to visit Epstein after he was convicted of the sex crime in a statement released by Buckingham Palace in August 2019.\n\nIn 2015, Virginia Giuffre brought a defamation case against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, alleging that the pair had sex-trafficked her starting in 2000, when she was known as Virginia Roberts.\n\nGiuffre alleged that Epstein forced her to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor in his New York mansion, in London, and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands in 2001 when she was 17.\n\nHowever, the allegation was thrown out and struck from the record by a judge, who said it was \"immaterial and impertinent to the central claim\" in the case at the time.\n\nFurther details about Giuffre's allegations against Mountbatten-Windsor were made public in 2019, after documents from the 2015 defamation case were unsealed.\n\nIn the documents related to sex-trafficking charges against Epstein, witness Johanna Sjoberg told investigators about a sexual incident that she said happened, and involved herself, Maxwell, Mountbatten-Windsor, Giuffre, and a puppet of the prince.\n\n\"Andrew and Virginia sat on the couch, and they put the puppet ... on her lap,\" Sjoberg was quoted as saying in the documents. \"I sat on Andrew's lap, I believe on my own volition, and they took the puppet's hands and put it on Virginia's breast, and so Andrew put his on mine.\"\n\nBuckingham Palace denied Mountbatten-Windsor's alleged involvement with Giuffre in a statement at the time.\n\n\"It is emphatically denied that The Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts,\" the palace's statement read. \"Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.\"\n\nMountbatten-Windsor made a statement after Epstein was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell on August 10, 2019, saying he sympathized \"with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.\"\n\nMountbatten-Windsor added that during the time he knew Epstein, he did not witness or \"suspect any behavior of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction.\"\n\nGiuffre responded with a statement of her own. Speaking to reporters outside a Manhattan court at the time, she said the prince \"knows exactly what he's done, and I hope he comes clean about it.\"\n\nDiscussing the allegations in a BBC \"Newsnight\" interview with host Emily Maitlis on November 16, 2019, Mountbatten-Windsor suggested that a photo appearing to show him with his hand around Giuffre's waist was fake.\n\nHe also said during the interview that on the night Giuffre alleged they had dinner, partied at a club in London called Tramp, and later had sex, that he was at home with his daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie.\n\nThe interview was perceived negatively and labeled a \"car crash\" by much of the British media.\n\nFollowing the interview, a string of charities, businesses, and universities cut ties with Mountbatten-Windsor, and on November 20, 2019, the duke announced he would step back from his royal duties.\n\n\"It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family's work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support,\" Mountbatten-Windsor said in a statement.\n\nAfter saying that the Queen had given him her permission to step back from his duties, Mountbatten-Windsor said he continued \"to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.\"\n\nHe added that he would be \"willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.\"\n\nIn a complaint filed at a New York federal court in August 2021, Giuffre said Mountbatten-Windsor was aware of her age and that she was a victim of sex trafficking when she was forced to have sex with him in 2001.\n\n\"I am holding Prince Andrew accountable for what he did to me. The powerful and the rich are not exempt from being held responsible for their actions,\" Giuffre said, via her lawyers, in a statement to ABC.\n\nJudge Lewis A. Kaplan denied Mountbatten-Windsor's motion to dismiss Giuffre's lawsuit on January 12, 2022, ruling that it was \"denied in all respects,\" allowing the case to proceed to trial. The new ruling did not preclude the parties from settling before the trial.\n\nA day later, Buckingham Palace issued a statement announcing that Mountbatten-Windsor would face the lawsuit as a private citizen.\n\n\"With The Queen's approval and agreement, The Duke of York's military affiliations and Royal patronages have been returned to The Queen,\" a spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said in a statement sent to Business Insider. \"The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen.\"\n\nMountbatten-Windsor stopped using the HRH title in any official capacity after the removal of the patronages and military affiliations, a royal source told Business Insider.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor settled with Giuffre on February 15, 2022, according to court documents obtained by Business Insider.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor intended to make a \"substantial donation to Ms. Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights,\" the sum of which was not disclosed, according to a joint statement made in the court filing.\n\nThe statement added: \"Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms. Giuffre's character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks. It is known that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked countless young girls over many years.\"\n\nGiuffre died by suicide in April 2025, just over three years after they reached a settlement.\n\nIn October 2022, The Mail on Sunday published an interview with Maxwell, who was imprisoned at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, at the time after being sentenced to 20 years in prison for sex trafficking girls for Epstein.\n\nIn the interview, she referred to Mountbatten-Windsor as her \"dear friend\" and expressed concern for him.\n\n\"He is paying such a price for the association with Jeffrey Epstein,\" Maxwell said. \"I care about him, and I feel so bad for him.\"\n\nMaxwell's comments contradicted those of Mountbatten-Windsor, who denied he was close to Maxwell during his legal proceedings with Guiffre.\n\nAs part of a lawsuit between an Epstein accuser and Maxwell, a New York judge unsealed the names of more than 170 of Epstein's associates.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor was among those identified in the documents, as were Bill Clinton and Donald Trump.\n\nThe documents further undermined Mountbatten-Windsor's assertion that he wasn't close friends with Maxwell or Epstein, as the manager of Epstein's Palm Beach home, Juan Alessi, said in a 2009 deposition that the former prince spent weeks at Epstein's home and received \"daily massages.\"\n\nIn addition, Alessi said Sarah Ferguson, the ex-wife of Mountbatten-Windsor, was also a close friend of Epstein.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor tried to rehabilitate his image in 2024 and early 2025 and return to the public eye. Still, the continual release of new information about his relationship with Epstein made his attempts futile.\n\nOn October 17, 2025, Mountbatten-Windsor announced he was giving up his royal titles.\n\n\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" the statement said. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"\n\n\"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further,\" he went on to say. \"I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"\n\nThe royal stopped being known as Prince Andrew after the announcement, going by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nThe January 30, 2026, drop of Epstein files included photos of Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to kneel over an unidentified woman, who was clothed and lying on the floor. It's unclear when or where the photos were taken.\n\nThe files also include emails between Epstein and an account called \"The Duke,\" who signs his emails \"A,\" as well as exchanges between Epstein and Ferguson.\n\nOn Thursday, Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office. It was his 66th birthday.\n\nThe former prince served as UK trade envoy from 2001 to 2011, and the Epstein files appear to show Mountbatten-Windsor forwarding emails with his official work reports to the disgraced financier in 2010 and 2011.\n\n\"Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,\" Oliver Wright, the assistant chief constable with the Thames Valley Police, said. \"It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence.\"\n\nKing Charles released a statement about the arrest on Thursday.\n\n\"I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,\" it said. \"What now follows is the full, fair, and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities. In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation.\"\n\n\"Let me state clearly: the law must take its course,\" the king's statement went on to say. \"As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.\"\n\nPolice were photographed at Sandringham estate in Norfolk, where Mountbatten-Windsor had been living, as well as his previous residence in Berkshire, on Thursday, carrying out searches of the properties.\n\nThe police released Mountbatten-Windsor \"under investigation\" around 11 hours after his arrest, AP reported. He was photographed leaving the Aylsham Police Station in a car.",

    "fullText": "For centuries, the British royal family has cultivated an image of duty and decorum. As public figures, they've also had their share of scandals.\n\nForbidden romances, tabloid firestorms, and allegations of misconduct have rocked the House of Windsor over the years.\n\nHere's a look at some of the biggest scandals involving royal family members.\n\nDirectly after his father died in 1936, Edward VIII took the throne. Less than a year later, he renounced it.\n\nThat's because he had fallen hard for Wallis Simpson, an American socialite who'd already been divorced once and was working through her second. His proposal of marriage caused social and political uproar, since the Church of England technically forbade Edward from marrying someone who'd been divorced. Eventually, Edward was forced to abdicate.\n\n\"I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King [...] without the help and support of the woman I love,\" he said in a radio address to the nation in December 1936.\n\nEdward and Simpson married in 1937 and stayed together until Edward's death in 1972. (And she wasn't the only commoner who married into royalty.)\n\nCaptain Peter Townsend was a Royal Air Force officer who served as an equerry — essentially an attendant to the royal family. He spent a great deal of time with Margaret, and before long, the two fell in love. The only problem was that he was married.\n\nThings got even more scandalous in 1953 when Townsend divorced his wife and proposed to Margaret, but the rules of the Church of England forbade such a marriage. (After all, Margaret's uncle Edward VIII had to relinquish the throne in order to marry a divorcee.)\n\nThe relationship came to a heartbreaking close in 1955 when they called off the engagement. There was simply no way for Captain Townsend and Princess Margaret to have a happy ending.\n\nNot long after calling things off with Townsend, Margaret married photographer Anthony Armstrong Jones. It was the first royal wedding to ever be televised.\n\nA few years later, their union became a source of \"growing public ridicule,\" The New York Times reported. They fought in public, Margaret took long vacations without her husband, and rumors swirled around her close friendship with a man 17 years her junior.\n\nIn 1976, the couple announced their separation, and two years later, they were officially divorced. Margaret became the first royal to divorce since Henry VIII, who reigned way back in the 1500s.\n\nIn 1992 — while then-Prince Charles and Princess Diana were still married — media outlets published the transcript of a conversation between Diana and an alleged lover named James Gilbey. In the conversation, Gilbey told Diana that he loved her and called her by the pet name \"Squidgy\" 53 times. That's how the scandal earned the memorable moniker \"Squidgygate.\"\n\nLater, in an interview, Diana confirmed that the conversation was real, but denied that it was adulterous in nature.\n\nNot long after Diana's leaked phone call, Charles, Queen Elizabeth's oldest son, had one of his own.\n\nAn Australian magazine published the transcript of a call between Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles — a longtime married friend. The transcript all but confirmed what many rumors had postulated: That Charles and Camilla were romantically involved.\n\nIn one of the more confounding parts of the conversation, the couple joked about Charles turning into a tampon in order to \"live inside\" Camilla's trousers.\n\nLater that year, Charles and Diana announced their separation.\n\nIn 1995, Diana sat down for a tell-all solo interview with journalist Martin Bashir to talk about the immense pressures of public life and her struggles with self-harm, postpartum depression, and bulimia. She also revealed that she knew about Charles' affair with Camilla. (\"There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded,\" she famously quipped.) And Diana even admitted that she'd been unfaithful to Charles, saying that she had been \"in love\" with James Hewitt, her riding instructor.\n\nThe BBC interview itself has since come under scrutiny. An article in the Sunday Times in 2020 alleged that Bashir manipulated Diana into doing the interview by showing her brother, Charles Spencer, fake bank statements that purported to show the media had been paying royal associates for information about her. A 2021 inquiry concluded that Bashir acted in a \"deceitful\" way, and the BBC and Bashir apologized.\n\nA few weeks after the interview, the Queen herself urged her son and daughter-in-law to divorce, and the following year, they made it official. Charles and Camilla, on the other hand, wed in 2005 and are still together.\n\nPrincess Anne, the only daughter of Queen Elizabeth II, married Olympic equestrian Mark Phillips in 1973. The couple spent large swaths of time apart and didn't appear to be happy — People magazine described the marriage as a \"joyless sham.\"\n\nThen, in spring 1989, a British newspaper obtained stolen copies of letters written to Anne by one of her equerries, a British naval officer named Timothy Laurence. Though the content of the letters wasn't made public, tabloids described them as \"extremely intimate\" and \"too hot to handle.\"\n\nIn 1992, Anne announced that she was divorcing Phillips, and that she planned to marry Laurence. The two have been together ever since.\n\nSarah Ferguson (popularly known as \"Fergie\") married Queen Elizabeth's son, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, in 1986.\n\nSix years later, scandal erupted: Paparazzi photographers captured Fergie vacationing with an American financial advisor named John Bryan. In one photo — an image quickly plastered on the front page of The Sun — Bryan appeared to be licking Fergie's foot.\n\nThings didn't go very well after that. Fergie and Andrew separated in 1992, the same year as Charles and Diana, and divorced in 1996.\n\nFergie's marital drama didn't end after the divorce. In 2010, a News of the World journalist posed as a businessman and said he got Fergie to accept a £500,00 (about $633,000) bribe in exchange for access to her ex-husband, The Guardian reported.\n\nA video recording of their meeting was released to the media, and Fergie later apologized, saying she'd made a \"serious lapse in judgment,\" Reuters reported.\n\nAfter admitting to his father that he'd tried marijuana, a 17-year-old Prince Harry spent a day at the Featherstone Lodge rehabilitation center in London, The Telegraph reported.\n\nA statement from the royal family said Harry had agreed to visit the clinic \"to learn about the possible consequences of starting to take cannabis.\"\n\nIn January 2005, British paper The Sun published a front-page photo of Harry wearing a Nazi armband, apparently at a costume party.\n\nThe prince, who was 20 at the time, quickly released a statement of apology that read: \"Prince Harry has apologised for any offence or embarrassment he has caused. He realises it was a poor choice of costume.\"\n\nThe British tabloid published the naked photos of the prince in 2012, which were taken by another party-goer during a game of strip billiards in his hotel suite.\n\nAccording to an anonymous source who was in attendance, the prince's security team appeared to be aware that people were taking photos.\n\n\"No one asked for our phones or anything about us when we arrived at the party,\" the source told The Sun. \"It was obvious people were taking pictures.\"\n\nAt the time the pictures were taken, Prince William and Kate Middleton were staying in a private holiday home owned by the Queen's nephew, Viscount Linley.\n\nAfter the couple won a lawsuit against the company, Closer was ordered to pay $118,000 in damages to William and Kate in 2017.\n\nAndrew served as the UK's trade envoy from 2001 through 2011, when he stepped down due to mounting criticism over some of his personal relationships, the BBC reported. Namely, he was close friends with American sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThis would not be the end of the matter, however.\n\nVirginia Giuffre, pictured with Andrew above, accused Epstein of forcing her to have sex with the prince when she was just 17 years old in 2001.\n\nThe allegations from a 2015 defamation case resurfaced in the media as the case became unsealed. Andrew denied the claims, and a spokesperson for Buckingham Palace \"emphatically denied\" the allegations in an August 2019 statement provided to Business Insider.\n\nFour days after a catastrophic interview with \"BBC Newsnight\" where he spoke about his friendship with Epstein, Andrew announced he would step down from his royal duties.\n\nEpstein was found dead in his prison cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.\n\nGiuffre died by suicide in 2025.\n\nMarkle sued the publication over the misuse of private information, infringement of copyright, and breach of the Data Protection Act 2018 after it published excerpts from the letter earlier this year. She won the lawsuit in 2021.\n\n\"I share this victory with each of you — because we all deserve justice and truth, and we all deserve better,\" Markle said in a statement.\n\nA judge later rejected the publisher's application for permission to appeal but said it can take the application to the Court of Appeals. The publisher, Associated Newspapers, said it would.\n\nThe announcement said they \"intend to step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen.\" They also wrote that they would split their time between North America and the UK.\n\nThe royal communications office followed up with a statement of their own.\n\n\"Discussions with The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage,\" the Queen's statement read. \"We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.\"\n\nThe couple carried out their last official royal engagement at the annual Commonwealth Day service in London in March 2020. They later bought a home in California.\n\nThe two-hour primetime special was full of stunning revelations.\n\nMarkle told Winfrey that Kate Middleton made her cry the week of her wedding over a flower girl dress and not the other way around, as had been reported in tabloids. She also said members of the royal family had \"concerns and conversations\" about how dark Archie's skin would be before he was born, and The Firm told them that Archie wouldn't receive a title or security, breaking from protocol.\n\nShe also opened up about having suicidal thoughts amid constant tabloid criticism and racism, and said a senior member of the royal institution wouldn't let her seek help.\n\nHarry revealed that his family cut him off financially in the first quarter of 2020, and that Charles stopped taking his phone calls before they announced they were stepping back from the royal family. He also said that it hurts that the royal family never acknowledged tabloids' racist treatment of Markle, and that none of the royal family members have reached out to apologize for the reasons he felt he had to leave.\n\nFollowing the interview, Buckingham Palace released a statement on behalf of the Queen.\n\n\"The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan,\" the statement read.\n\n\"The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. Whilst some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately.\n\n\"Harry, Meghan, and Archie will always be much loved family members.\"\n\nAndrew was arrested at his home in Sandringham, Norfolk, on February 19 and was released from police custody several hours later. An investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe Justice Department's Epstein files revealed additional communications between Andrew and Epstein when the former prince was a UK trade envoy. Police conducted searches of his Sandringham home and at his former home in Windsor, Berkshire.\n\n\"I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,\" Charles said in a statement. \"What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities.\"\n\nThe king's statement continued: \"In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation. Let me state clearly: the law must take its course. As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.\"",

    "title": "What It Actually Means to 'Tone' Your Muscles",
    "description": "Muscles can get bigger and stronger, but they don't get toned-er. Sort of.",
    "fullText": "The word “toning” is something of a joke in many fitness circles, because it’s a word that’s thrown around when people mean other things. Sometimes it’s a code word for being thin, as when somebody may promise you that a workout will tone your muscles rather than making you bulky. Other times it’s a moneymaking gambit, as when somebody says you can do their toning exercises at home rather than buying weights or a gym membership instead.\n\nTo the extent that the word means anything, we talked about this a bit when we discussed the fear of getting bulky. Being “toned” usually means having some muscle definition while still being able to see your body as feminine or thin. \"Toned\" isn't anything in human biology—it's a word we use when walking a tightrope of ways we hope to be perceived.\n\nWhen you ask your muscles to do something, they get better at doing it. While entire dissertations have been written about exactly what happens inside your muscle cells when you exercise, the ways we change our muscles when we lift weights mostly fall into two categories:\n\nYou get better at using that muscle (neuromuscular adaptations)\n\nThe muscle gets bigger (hypertrophy)\n\nOf those two things, only the second one (the muscle getting bigger) has a visual impact. Both of them affect how strong you are, or to put it another way, what you can do with that muscle. Getting stronger and getting bigger happen together: You can try to favor one over the other, but training for strength will get you bigger muscles as a side effect, and training for bigger muscles is pretty much impossible without also getting stronger.\n\nNow, the human body is complex, so of course there aren’t only two things that happen. But those are the main ones. Other things that happen, if less noticeably:\n\nYour muscles get better at contracting repeatedly (muscular endurance)\n\nYou burn calories during the workout\n\nThese features aren’t exclusive to strength training. You burn calories and build endurance with cardio, too, such as running.\n\nThese last two items do not have a visible effect on your body. You can’t tell how good somebody’s endurance is by looking at them. Burning calories can theoretically result in fat loss, or even muscle loss, but that also depends on how many calories you eat. Exercise, by itself, does not necessarily change the amount of fat on your body.\n\nWhen we look at the visible changes we can make to our bodies through exercise, there are really only two things we can control:\n\nWe can make specific muscles bigger with resistance training (such as lifting weights)\n\nWe can eat fewer calories than we burn, while also resistance training to preserve muscle; this causes us to lose fat all over our bodies.\n\nNote that you can target which muscles you want to get bigger, but there’s no way to lose fat on a specific body part. Fat distribution isn’t really under our control, which is why you can’t exercise your way to a flat tummy, or slim your thighs, or anything like that. You can work your muscles to make them bigger, and eat in a calorie deficit to make your whole body smaller, and see what happens.\n\nTo address a few other things that get discussed alongside toning: You can’t build “long, lean muscles” specifically. Lean just means without fat, so if you want to look lean, you’re looking at fat loss.\n\nAnd the length of a muscle isn’t something you can control: It’s attached to your bones. How would it get longer? Sometimes people mean that they want their muscles not to look rounded or not to have a peak in their bicep, but that’s not really under our control either. The shape of your muscle comes down to things like its attachment points and the length of your tendons versus the contractile portion of the muscles. Those are just things you’re born with, and training can't really change them.\n\nBased on what we know so far, you’d expect that if you want muscle definition while looking slimmer, you’d need to lift weights and pay attention to your diet. (You would also be smart to do some cardio, which is good for your health and won’t kill your gains).\n\nSo then what’s with all these “toning” workouts? Isn’t there a “toning” rep range? Don’t you need smaller weights for “toning” than for getting jacked? What gives? Well, I hate to break it to you, but that’s all bullshit people say to sell stuff.\n\nHere’s the truth about rep ranges: Anything up to about 15 reps will do a pretty good job of growing your muscles and making you stronger. Anything up to about 30 reps can still grow your muscles if you take the lift to failure (that is, by rep 30 your muscles are burning and you literally can’t do another rep). Beyond that—or if you’re doing a high rep set but you put the dumbbells down before you hit failure—you’re not doing much to increase the size or strength of your muscles. You’re still working on endurance, but endurance isn’t going to do much to change how your body looks.\n\nWhat about the size of your weights? Well, to hit those appropriate rep ranges, you need to lift weights that are “heavy” for you. Maybe you’re new to this and five pounds is a really challenging bicep curl. Perfect! That’s your “heavy,” for now. As you get stronger, you’ll need heavier weights. (Keep in mind, though: different exercises use different muscle groups. Somebody who uses a five-pound weight for curls is going to need a heavier weight for goblet squats.)\n\nIf your muscle-building exercises don’t involve weights, the same principles still apply. If it’s hard for you to do 10 air squats, then air squats are helping you to build muscle in your legs and butt. But if you can do 50, you’ll need to either add some weight or find a different no-equipment exercise that is appropriately challenging.\n\nIf you’re determined to get “toned,” the muscular training you need to do is no different than what a person would do to get jacked. The difference is that getting jacked involves a lot of food (that muscle has to come from somewhere) and a lot of time. Even if you spend all your time in the gym, you won’t come out looking like the Hulk at the end of the year. That’s bad news for people who want to look like the Hulk, and good news for people who don’t.\n\nSo you need to do normal-ass strength training. With that in mind, let’s look at a couple of workouts that get marketed as being for “toning”:\n\nHIIT workouts: True HIIT workouts improve your aerobic capacity (making you a faster runner, for example) but they don’t have any special advantage in calorie burning or muscle building. A lot of popular ones aren’t even real HIIT, they’re just circuit training.\n\nCircuit training: Doing a series of different exercises with little to no rest, and then repeating that series, is called circuit training. It’s a mix of strength training and cardio, which makes it a good choice if you don’t have time to do two separate workouts. Crossfit WODs (workout of the day) fall into this category, too. You’ll probably get better results if you separate the strength and cardio components, but if you enjoy circuit training, it’ll do the job.\n\nHigh-rep exercises without weights or with light weights: A lot of booty band and ankle weight workouts fall into this category. If they feel hard enough to count as strength training, great! But most are not, especially once you’re not a beginner anymore. At that point, they’re just training endurance without actually building muscle. If you like them, or if endurance is important to you, enjoy. But they’re not going to “tone” you at all.",

    "title": "Eight Gadgets That Can Turn Your Microwave Into a More Versatile Appliance",
    "description": "Microwaves are essential kitchen appliances, but they have limitations—unless you pair them with the right tools.",
    "fullText": "Just about everyone has a microwave. You might not know its wattage, vintage, or what in the heck half the buttons actually do, but you know that if you pop something in there and cook it for a while, you get hot food back for your trouble. Some intrepid souls actually learn how to use a microwave properly, expertly timing out defrostings, reheatings, and popcorn by the bucket. They really are incredibly useful and powerful appliances.\n\nAs amazing as your microwave is, it could be better—it just needs a little help. If you really want to get the most out of your appliance, you’ll need to pick up a few microwave gadgets that will expand its capabilities and take out some of the guesswork.\n\nFirst and foremost, we all know one of the main frustrations with microwaves: You can typically only cook/heat one dish at a time. If you’re warming up some leftovers for yourself and a partner, someone’s plate is going to sit on the counter for a bit, cooling off, while the second one cooks. And if you’re trying to actually cook an entire meal with your microwave, you’re going to have a heck of a time serving everything up at a consistent temperature.\n\nUnless you invest in a microwave-safe plate stacker. It’s a simple idea that instantly makes your microwave more useful, because you can now cook or heat up several things at once.\n\nCan you cook eggs in the microwave without a cool gadget? Sure—as long as you’re not terribly picky about how your eggs turn out. If you’d prefer to enjoy eating the eggs you cook in there, you should pick up an egg boiler to make hard- or soft-boiled eggs, and an egg cooker that can poach or scramble an egg perfectly (it can also make adorable mini-omelets). These little tools ensure your eggs come out fluffy and delicious instead of rubbery and weird-looking.\n\nEntire restaurant chains have been built on our collective love of toasted sandwiches, but they’re impossible to make in a microwave ... unless you have one of these sandwich maker gadgets. With one, you can make grilled cheese sandwiches, panini, or even quesadillas to your heart’s content without firing up your burner.\n\nYou can cook anything in a microwave, as long as your working definition of “cooked” is just “hot.” As anyone who’s ever tried in desperation to cook bacon in their microwave knows, what you get is a soggy mass of bacon-esque stuff. Unless you have this microwaveable bacon grill, which makes it possible to cook up crispy bacon without dealing with a greasy pan that spits pain at you, or the lengthy cleanup it requires.\n\nA rice cooker is a terrific appliance if you make a lot of rice, but sometimes you don’t have room for one more countertop or stovetop appliance, and not everyone makes rice often enough to need one. This cheap microwave rice cooker makes it dead simple to cook a batch of rice in your microwave in a little over 10 minutes, and the rice comes out fluffy, slightly sticky, and delicious.\n\nCooking dry pasta isn’t exactly rocket science. Even if you don’t bother reading directions or don’t really care about al dente pasta, it’s just a matter of boiling water, dumping in pasta, and cooking until it’s soft and edible.\n\nBut if you need to cut some corners and skip the time it takes to boil water, you can cook pasta to a very acceptable level of al dente-ness in the microwave with the Fasta Pasta Microwave Cooker. It’s only usable with dry pasta—fresh pasta will still have to be boiled, sorry—but it ensures perfect pasta every time in just a few minutes, without any boiling necessary. It even has pre-measured cutouts in the lid so you can easily portion out your meals.\n\nIt happens: You’re craving cake, and you have no cake. You have all the ingredients for cake, but you lack the most important thing: The will to pull it all together, fire up the oven, and wait.\n\nEnter the Rapid Cake Maker. Put your mix, eggs, and other ingredients into the appropriate (and pre-measured) container, combine in the pan and mix, then microwave for 5-6 minutes. That’s right, that’s all that stands between you and a warm, moist cake. We are truly living in the future.\n\nSteaming is a nice method to cook fresh-tasting vegetables and fish. Steaming on a stovetop can produce a fair amount of dirty dishes, though—or maybe you're just low on stovetop space. Steaming in your microwave using one of these, on the other hand, is a fast and easy alternative. Add water to the bottom, adjust the vents, cover, and in a few minutes your food is cooked perfectly. It can be used with fresh or frozen veggies or anything else you would normally steam cook.",

    "title": "Some Samsung Users Are Already Reporting Dead Screens on Their $2,900 Galaxy Z TriFold Phones",
    "description": "Which is why you should always be careful if you choose to early adopt.",
    "fullText": "Starting at the end of last month, Samsung finally started selling its first trifolding phone in the U.S. Customers who were willing to spend an eye-watering $2,900 were able to snag a 10-inch display that folds up to fit in a pocket, but as with many first-gen devices, it turns out there have been a few growing pains. Two users who took the plunge on the Samsung Galaxy Z Trifold have shared on Reddit that their screens are already unresponsive—but to Samsung's credit, the company isn't leaving them hanging.\n\nThe first user, who had their phone for about a month and a half (they bought their unit while overseas) before issues appeared, posted three days ago that their inner screen had started periodically flashing green before cutting to black, after which it would be unresponsive. Sometimes, restarts appeared to fix the issue immediately, while in other cases, the phone would need to stay on for a few hours first before a restart would fix the problem.\n\nThe other report is a bit more concerning, and claims the user's inner screen completely died within just five days of purchase. According to this user, the issue first started showing up as ghost touching, or the device recognizing touches when there weren't any. The following day, the screen was pure white, and has remained unresponsive since. Alongside the white screen, the user also reported hearing a \"strange popping sound\" while closing the device and seeing what appeared to be an air bubble underneath the screen.\n\nBoth reports follow a less severe one from a Korean user, who said in mid-January that their phone had a line of dead pixels down the lefthand side of the device. All three users have posted photographic evidence alongside their complaints.\n\nFor the American users, neither said they put their device through any stress, with the first saying their issues popped up \"during normal usage\" and the second saying they \"have done nothing but baby\" their phone. While we can't know for sure what happened with these phones without seeing them ourselves, some users do have speculation. For the device that flashed green, one Redditor suggested that's indicative of a bad ribbon cable, something I can confirm I've seen on other devices. As for the device with the unresponsive white screen, one user pointed to defects in other first-gen foldables, something that has been seen on both the Galaxy Z Fold 1 and the original Pixel Fold.\n\nAs for the dead pixels on the Korean phone, the users' post did not mention how the issue first appeared, at least going by a machine translation.\n\nIt's disappointing to see such big investments immediately disappoint these users, but all have had luck in contacting Samsung support. The first user with a dead screen posted an update today that said Samsung is repairing their phone for free, although it'll take 1-3 weeks for them to get the device back. The second said they opted for a return instead, and will return to the cheaper Galaxy Z Fold 7 rather than use the new device. \"5 days is a little silly for hardware failure,\" they said of their decision. Finally, the Korean user with dead pixels said that Samsung replaced their device for free, while taking their old one \"for research.\"\n\nWhile these are only a few users' experiences, it's not a great look for Samsung, and it's a good reminder to be careful if you choose to early adopt. If you do choose to go in on a Trifold, it might be worth buying a Samsung Care+ plan alongside it, to help protect your $2,900 investment from accidental damage or keep it eligible for repairs after the warranty expires. \n\nGranted, you'll have at least one day before you need to make that decision. The Galaxy Z Trifold is once again out of stock in the U.S., but a new batch is set to drop tomorrow. Hopefully, this batch will be a bit more durable than the last.",

    "description": "Reviews, images, and even some restaurants are missing from the map.",
    "fullText": "I use Google Maps to get from point A to point B, but I also use it for research. It's an essential tool for finding new restaurants to try, or for identifying well-reviewed hotels in a new area. While many use it with their Google account, others might like to keep some of their data out of Google's hands. Using Google Maps while signed out is a good way to do that: You can find new locations of interest without having Google know you're interested in those spots. However, if you like using Google Maps without an account, be warned: The experience is now much more limited.\n\nAs reported by 9to5Google, Google is now limiting the amount of data visible when accessing Google Maps without an account. This change includes things like images, reviews, restaurants, businesses, hotels, parks—really, most labels on the map. From what I can tell, essential labels like city names and highway identifiers are left intact, but even some street names appear to be omitted when logged out.\n\nIf you can find restaurants in limited view, you'll see some of the data points that you'd normally find, but you'll also notice a number missing as well. That could include labels noting whether the restaurants supports takeout or delivery, user reviews, popular times, photos and videos submitted by users, menus, as well as related locations. I tested it myself in an incognito window, scrolled randomly over Richmond, VA, and clicked the first (of few) restaurants to appear: Laura Lee's. While I could see the total star rating (4.6), I couldn't actually click through to any reviews. I could also only see the primary image of the restaurant. There's enough here to decide whether or not to call, but it's missing a ton of the data points you'd usually rely on to consider a spot for lunch or dinner.\n\nGoogle doesn't necessarily pin the limited view on you being logged out, however. If you check the \"Help\" pop-up that appears here, titled \"Seeing a limited view of Google Maps,\" the company explains that there are a few reasons you might be seeing this view. That could include issues with Google Maps itself, unusual traffic from your computer or network, or browser extensions that might be interfering with Google Maps. Only after it lists these reasons does Google suggest that signing in to Google Maps \"might help you avoid seeing this limited experience again.\"\n\nOf course, logging in brings all this data back as you'd expect, and if you always use Google Maps with your Google account, you'll never notice the difference. But it's an interesting line in the sand for Google to draw. How many people who use Google Maps without an account will know this is the reason why their experience just got worse? Perhaps they'll flock to another option, though there aren't many. Apple users have Apple Maps, and there's always Waze—but, surprise, it's owned by Google too.",

    "description": "It's more of a shortcut to a web tool.",
    "fullText": "When your internet isn't as fast as it should be, it can be helpful to check a network speed test tool. If the results are slower than expected, you'll know it's your network that's acting up. If it's performing well, perhaps it's the website in question, your web browser, or the device itself that's in need of a tune up. You have plenty of options across the internet to choose from, of course, but if you have a PC, you're about to get one built right into the OS—at least, in theory.\n\nAs part of the latest Release Preview Channel update for Windows 11 Insiders, Microsoft rolled out a network speed test tool, though \"shortcut\" might be a more appropriate word. This shortcut isn't its own app; rather, you access it directly from the taskbar. You right-click the network icon, choose the \"Perform speed test\" option, and, subsequently, Windows fires up your browser. You'll see Bing load up—even if you have another search engine of choice as your default—where a simplified \"Internet speed test\" tool appears.\n\nWhile I wouldn't blame you for assuming this tool was a Microsoft creation, it's actually made by Speedtest, of speedtest.net fame. (Disclosure: Lifehacker's parent company, Ziff Davis, owns Speedtest.) As Tom's Hardware highlights, the integration itself isn't actually new, as Speedtest first started running a network speed tool within Bing back in December of 2023. The news now, of course, is that this tool is available as a shortcut within the Windows taskbar itself.\n\nIt's a neat addition to Windows, and makes sense to include within the network icon in the taskbar, but something that actually runs natively on your PC would certainly be better. Maybe the convenience of quickly right-clicking the network icon whenever my internet was slow would win out, but I imagine I'd rather head to the full Speedtest tool, especially to avoid using Bing.\n\nThis shortcut isn't the only thing new here. Microsoft also added new settings options that let you pan and tilt connected cameras. There are new emojis on the way, including face with bags under eyes and harp, and the Widget settings menu now takes up a full page. You can also now set .webp files as your desktop background, so you don't need to convert these images ahead of time.\n\nYou can try these features out now if you enroll in the Windows Insider program. While you run the risk of unstable software by enrolling your PC here, the Release Preview Channel is much less risky than the Dev or Beta channels, since the Releaser Preview Channel issues updates that have gone through more testing.",

    "description": "Make sure your backup settings are good to go.",
    "fullText": "While Android has automated, built-in backups for plenty of data, including photos, apps, and settings, local files have been excluded. In order to ensure you don't lose PDFs, documents, and other files stored on your device, you have to manually upload or copy them to the cloud or another location. But that's changing, at least in part: the February Google Play Services update comes with a new feature that will copy and upload your Downloads folder to Google Drive.\n\nThis is a meaningful update to Android's backup system, but it has some limitations. Here's what to know before enabling it.\n\nAs Android Authority describes, the local file backup feature applies only to items in your Downloads folder. It will not cover your device's entire internal storage. The backup will go to Google Drive as a static copy, meaning that files will not be continuously synced, and if you make changes in one location, they won't be reflected in the other. Backups will likely take place occasionally, such as when your phone is idle, charging, and connected to wifi.\n\nAndroid handles videos and photos similarly with backups to Google Photos. Other device data, like your call and text history and system settings, are backed up to Google Drive.\n\nWhile automatic backups of local files are useful for anyone who doesn't already have a comprehensive backup plan (and if you don't, you should), they could potentially take up a significant amount of space in your Google Drive storage. If you keep lots of invoices, tickets, documents, or installers in your Downloads folder, you may want to be more selective about what you back up and where—especially if you already pay for extra Drive capacity and need it for other purposes.\n\nThankfully, file backups are disabled by default. To turn them on, go to Settings > Google Backup and select Downloads. You can also change your backup preferences for photos and videos and \"other device data\" from this menu. Note that this feature is expected to be rolled out gradually and may not be available on your device immediately.",

    "fullText": "The next generation of Meta's Display smart glasses might come with a smart watch. According to a report from The Information, Meta's watch, codenamed Malibu 2, could feature fitness tracking features and AI, but its real purpose is to replace the Display's neural band and act as controller for the smart glasses. If the reports are accurate, Meta Display smart glasses with a smart watch could be available in 2026.\n\nThere aren't any other details on the smart watch, so we don't know the price or what features it may have—but I'd be surprised if this rumor doesn't pan out eventually. Meta has discussed the idea of a smart watch before, and it makes sense: If you're going to have a wrist-controller for your glasses, why not give it smart watch features as well? Especially if a glasses-and-watch combo potentially gives users a reason to switch away from their Apple Watches.\n\nSpeaking of Apple, if the rumors about the company are true, Apple is pushing to release its own suite of AI-powered wearable devices. According to a report in Bloomberg, Apple could roll out smart glasses in early 2027. The company is also reportedly developing an AI-powered pendant that can \"be pinned to a shirt or worn as a necklace,\" as well as AirPods with expanded AI capabilities. The AirPods and pendant will be equipped with cameras designed to \"help the AI work\" as opposed to taking photos. Apple's smart glasses will reportedly not feature a display, but will feature a higher end camera and superior build quality to Meta's smart glasses. All of Apple's devices are reportedly designed to work with iPhones.\n\nNone of this is confirmed, of course. The closest Apple has come to announcing these plans is CEO Tim Cook mentioning “categories of products” enabled by artificial intelligence at an all-hands meeting. However, everything points to Meta and Apple betting that consumers want a collection of connected AI-wearables. Each company is taking a different approach to hooking users into their ecosystem. Apple seems to be betting on devices integrated with iPhones and controlled with the kind of camera-based tech that powers the Apple Vision Pro headset. Meta seems to be aiming at replacing phones with an in-glasses display, and a biometric control scheme that works with muscle movements, like the existing neural band.\n\nBoth Meta and Apple seem to be competing to go beyond a screen or smart glasses to become the next interface for your life—but do people want that? Are consumers excited enough by the prospect of always-available AI and tied-together devices to buy them? That's the big question, and the answer is anything but certain. Both Apple and Meta have made big bets on virtual reality, and, despite both companies' VR devices being excellent, neither seems to have captured the market in way these firms would have liked. So, as they say, stay tuned.",

    "description": "I sort of hoped Brain.fm was selling snake oil, but I liked it more than I expected to.",
    "fullText": "Sometimes a life hack works when I wish it didn't. I, for example, am vulnerable to depression and anxiety. I also passionately hate running. I have, unfortunately, discovered that running regularly helps my mental health a great deal. I'm thankful (because I feel better) and resentful (because I have to run).\n\nThis is how I feel about Brain.fm, a music service I discovered a couple weeks ago when the company got in touch with me. I started using the service, mostly for the purposes of writing this article, and something unexpected happened: I noticed it's a great deal easier to get started on my work in the morning. I like this (because I'm getting more done) but am also annoyed (because I'd rather be listening to the music I love).\n\nIt's a conundrum. Brain.fm is a subscription service that costs $14.99 per month, more than Spotify (which costs $12.99 per month). The product sells itself as having a collection of music backed by scientific research to increase your ability to focus, meditate, and sleep. There's also a free trial, meaning you can get a feel for whether it works for you.\n\nAfter a few weeks of testing, I feel it might be onto something. I don't always trust my intuition, though, so I wanted to dig deeper. Is this for real? Or am I falling for snake oil? More importantly: can I go back to listening to KEXP in the morning?\n\nAfter a few days of using the application, I couldn't help but wonder. Is my increased focus real? Or is it a placebo?\n\nSo I wrote to Daniel J. Levitin, professor emeritus of neurology at McGill University, and author of This Is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession. He replied quickly, and concisely: \"It's all placebo,\" he said.\n\nIt was a very concise email from an academic about a complex topic, which as a journalist is always nice. But Levitin didn't stop there—he told me to get in touch with another neuroscientist, one who had published research on this type of modulated music. I'll say more below about that research, but first, let's take a look at what's actually in those Brain.fm tracks.\n\nYou can't use this service to search for a specific artist—you instead let the application know what you're trying to do (Focus, Relax, Meditate, or Sleep). In the Focus section, there are a few sub-options: Deep Work, Motivation, Creativity, Learning, and Light Work. Choose what you want to do and a track will start playing.\n\nThe genres, such as they are, range from the kind of \"chill beats\" you can find on YouTube to post-rock and symphonic—though it's all instrumental.\n\n\"The basic problem is that most music is made to grab your attention,\" Kevin Woods, a neuroscience PhD who works for Brain.fm, told me. \"If you talk to a music producer, they'll tell you that their job is to make things punchy and bright, and to make somebody sit up and turn their head and favorite the song on Spotify.\"\n\nThat attention seeking can make playing music during the work day distracting in a subtle way, according to Woods. \"The problem is that a lot of the distraction is not overt in the sense of, 'I can feel my attention breaking and I have to turn this off or turn down the volume'—it's more like, 'I'm working at 70, 80% capacity, and I'm not really sure why.'\"\n\nSo the music at Brain.fm is written and performed by in-house composers who are intentionally trying not to keep your attention. But that alone doesn't really set Brain.fm apart from using ambient music or video game soundtracks to focus, let alone the various \"chill beats\" playlists and live streams that are out there. And that's where Brain.fm's scientific claims come in.\n\nBrain.fm points to several scientific studies on its homepage, also mentioning that its research was in part funded by that National Science Foundation. A lot of the claims are based on \"amplitude modulation,\" which Woods told me is what sets Brain.fm's music apart.\n\nBut what is amplitude modulation? They're \"fast modulations added that do not usually occur in music,\" according to Woods. If you listen to the music for a bit, you'll hear an almost fluttering kind of sound. These sounds, which are added to compositions in post-production using AI, are available at three different levels for each track. The \"ADHD Mode,\" which is the highest of the three settings, is what I mostly used while testing.\n\nI find this effect a little bit disorienting, so I sometimes needed to turn the setting down. It's hard to deny the effect is a musical signature of Brain.fm. But does it work?\n\nI became a bit less skeptical of the science after getting in touch with the expert that Levitin recommended: Psyche Loui, a neuroscientist, musician, and Associate Dean of Research at Northeastern University. Loui told me that \"it's not all placebo\", pointing to a paper she published alongside Woods and other neurologists in Communications Biology.\n\nNow, to be clear, it's not unusual for scientists to disagree about how things work—that's part of the process. And the claims made by the paper are narrow—the conclusion is that music with amplitude modulation can help people focus on tasks when compared to both pink noise and music without amplitude modulation. The control music, according to Woods, were the same tracks—the only difference was whether amplitude modulation was added. The results of testing, and brain scans, suggest the effect is real.\n\n\"We did something which is rarely done in music research, which is a very well-controlled study that only changes one factor in the music,\" Woods told me. As with all scientific research, there's always more to learn. But to me, a study making these claims published in a Nature-affiliated publication suggests there might be something to this.\n\nBrain.fm, if nothing else, has been an opportunity to reflect on my relationship with music. I really enjoy discovering new music during the workday, but after using Brain.fm for a few weeks I wonder if that might have been the reason I have trouble focusing in the morning.\n\nMaybe it's best to listen to music that fades into the background when it's time to focus, and save music discovery for when I only need part of my brain. And maybe I should save the music I really love for when I'm not working at all. Brain.fm, if nothing else, taught me that.\n\nBut I also find that the music really does work when I need to focus. I still am not fully sure if the effect is real, or if any music that blends into the background would do the job. I sometimes play the entire Boards of Canada discography when I need to focus, and find that works about as well.\n\nAll that having been said, I really think anyone who has read this much about Brain.fm should probably go ahead and see for themselves.",

    "description": "BBC Scotland looks at the fallout from Kasper Schmeichel's performance in Celtic' Stuttgart defeat.",
    "fullText": "At half-time in Celtic's eventual 4-1 Europa League play-off defeat by Stuttgart, the focus was on home goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel.\n\n\"It looks to me as if he is not expecting shots, which is strange for a goalkeeper,\" former Scotland forward James McFadden said. \"He's expecting defenders to stop every shot.\n\n\"Teams will be saying there appears to be a weakness to his left-hand side.\"\n\nThe Denmark shot-stopper had been beaten down to his left by a tame Bilal El Khannouss shot for Stuttgart's opening goal, before the on-loan Leicester City man added a second with a free header from seven yards out.\n\nAnd at full-time, attention was on Schmeichel again.\n\nJamie Leweling's powerful strike from range - not in the bottom corner - went straight through the 39-year-old goalkeeper for the visitors' third.\n\nTiago Tomas added a fourth in the closing stages to compound a disappointing night for Celtic, who host Hibernian and go to Rangers in the Scottish Premiership, either side of next Thursday's unlikely salvage mission in Germany.\n\nSportsound: Celtic face Europa League exit\n\nWith fans protesting against the club's board at the start of the game and later ironically cheering Schmeichel making a save, the atmosphere at Parkhead was far from harmonious.\n\n\"It's bitterly disappointing,\" former Celtic captain and manager Neil Lennon said of the jeers directed at Schmeichel.\n\n\"He had a bad night but it still doesn't warrant that kind of treatment.\"\n\nThursday night was the latest in a string of perceived errors made by Schmeichel, following Joe Hugill's looping header for Kilmarnock last weekend and Jonathan Rowe's effort for Bologna last month.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Celtic closed ranks around their embattled goalkeeper post-match.\n\n\"It's a tough evening for us,\" interim manager Martin O'Neill said. \"On paper, 4-1 looks pretty poor.\n\n\"We were masters of our own downfall in many respects, conceded some poor goals.\n\n\"Kasper [Schmeichel] has made some great saves while I've been here. This is a collective, there's no doubt about that.\n\n\"We played Feyenoord in a game we probably had to win and he made an unbelievable save, otherwise we wouldn't be here playing tonight.\n\n\"I will think about all sorts of things [before the next game], but Kasper has done really well since I've arrived at the football club, in both spells.\"\n\nCaptain Callum McGregor added: \"Everyone makes mistakes.\n\n\"Kasper has been amazing since he's come to the club. He'll dust that down. We win as a team and lose as a team.\n\n\"There's no blame, he's made so many big saves for us. He'll bounce back for sure.\"\n\nCeltic endure punishing night at hands of ruthless Stuttgart\n\nCeltic given full Ibrox stand in Scottish Cup\n\nThere is evidence that - particularly in Europe - Schmeichel has underperformed this season.\n\nHe has conceded 19 goals in nine Europa League matches this term, with a save percentage of just 62.\n\nCeltic's expected goals on target conceded - the likelihood of an on-target shot resulting in a goal - is 13.96 across those games. In essence, Schmeichel has conceded four goals more than the data would expect him to.\n\nMcFadden thinks Celtic's season could go one way or another based on whether O'Neill decides to stick with Schmeichel or promote understudy Viljami Sinisalo.\n\n\"Does the season hinge on it? It might do because if Martin O'Neill opts to stick with Kasper Schmeichel, that's a big decision. If he opts to change him, that's a big decision.\n\n\"If you feel that's the decision to be made because you feel more secure at the back, then you make it.\"\n\nOne man who knows what it feels like to line up between the sticks at Parkhead is BBC Scotland pundit Pat Bonner, who thinks a change should be made.\n\n\"My opinion is that Sinisalo should have got a run in the team earlier this season,\" he said.\n\nDespite Schmeichel's mistakes, Lennon also questioned the way Celtic performed as a collective on a night when Stuttgart proved far too strong.\n\n\"Celtic lacked a lot of power and intensity, certainly in a defensive capacity,\" he said. \"It was far too easy, far too stand-offish.\n\n\"That is not a Martin O'Neill team or a Martin O'Neill performance.\n\n\"I cannot believe the lack of passion.\"\n\nVisit our Celtic page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Celtic news notifications in the BBC Sport app",

    "description": "Inside the Hungarian midfielder's season as the main character at Liverpool, his friendship with Mohamed Salah and why the Reds are keen to extend his contract.",
    "fullText": "On his forearm, Dominik Szoboszlai has a tattoo in Hungarian which reads 'Talent is a divine blessing, but without incredible will and humility, it is worth nothing'.\n\nDig a little deeper and you find the quote is attributed to Steven Gerrard.\n\nWhen midfielder Szobozslai arrived at Liverpool from RB Leipzig in 2023 for £60m, there was a reason why he took the number eight shirt that had become synonymous with Gerrard at Anfield.\n\nEarlier that summer, Alexis Mac Allister turned down the chance to take the number, but Szoboszlai craved that main-character energy.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been Liverpool's main character this season, scoring his 10th goal of the season last weekend, to go with seven assists.\n\nWhen it was put to him that he was having a \"Steven Gerrard season\", he politely disagreed and insisted he was writing his own story.\n\nOnly forward Hugo Ekitike has more goal involvements and captain Virgil van Dijk has played more minutes than Szoboszlai for Liverpool this season - and close friend Mohamed Salah described him as \"one of the best players in the world right now\".\n\nThe Hungary international may insist on being his own man, but when it comes to taking responsibility as others struggle, and having his own goal of the season competition at the club, there are certainly similarities to the iconic and inspirational Gerrard.\n\nSzoboszlai hasn't always played in his preferred number 10 position this season, but is scoring more frequently - his stunning free-kicks against Arsenal and Manchester City came in games he started at right-back. The step-up in both consistency and output has been clear.\n\nIn a tumultuous Liverpool campaign that has involved speculation about the future of Salah and defenders Ibrahima Konate and Andy Robertson, perhaps the most important negotiation will be with Szoboszlai, who has just over two years to run on the initial five-year deal signed in 2023.\n\nSpanish outlet Marca reported comments last week from Hungary boss Marco Rossi in which he said Szoboszlai's one dream was to play for Real Madrid. The club's Brazilian forward Vinicius Jr also named the Hungary captain as one of his closest friends outside Real.\n\nEncouragingly for Liverpool supporters, talks over a new contract have started, and Szoboszlai said earlier this month he loved the city and the club. His agent, Matyas Esterhazy, added this week on Hungarian TV the player was not looking for a move elsewhere.\n\nThose who see him on a daily basis at Liverpool describe him as highly competitive with a clear desire to excel.\n\nSzoboszlai is regularly among the first to arrive at training and it's no surprise he's high up in terms of the club's running and physical stats. No Liverpool player has covered more distance this season.\n\nIn a recent video on Liverpool's channels, Milos Kerkez - who plays with him for club and country - said Szoboszlai would be a 400m runner if he wasn't a footballer.\n\n\"He could jog from Liverpool to Hungary and not get tired,\" joked left-back Kerkez.\n\nSzoboszlai is a man determined in his own right, but Salah's high standards are understood to have a big influence on him. Away from football, the pair enjoy playing backgammon and often hang out together at each other's houses.\n\nWhen he was described as \"disrespectful\" last month by Barnsley boss Conor Hourihane for attempting a backheel in his own box that led to a mistake and goal for the League One side, Szoboszlai spoke up to defend himself.\n\nPrivately, manager Arne Slot had a word too.\n\nSzoboszlai's prime years are ahead of him. He was handed the national team captaincy at 22 and Liverpool view him as a future skipper, just like Gerrard.\n\nWith vice-captain Robertson expected to depart this summer and Van Dijk's deal expiring in 2027, the possibility is certainly there.\n\nAsked if Szoboszlai has the attributes to be a future leader, Slot said: \"Yes, but he is still young. He has a lot of attributes already, especially when it comes to leading by example. There is still a step to make in terms of leadership, being vocal and a voice in the dressing room if I compare him to Virgil, which is completely normal.\n\n\"Virgil is 34 and has seen [James] Milner, [Jordan] Henderson and these players, so it's really good for Dominik that he sees Virgil. That would be the next step for him; to be as vocal and as loud as Virgil but that comes wih time.\n\n\"But for all the other things, he has a lot to become a very influential player for Liverpool and you could call that a leader.\"\n\nDuring his first season at Liverpool which was Jurgen Klopp's last campaign, Szoboszlai struggled in a game at Luton, and his frustrations summed up when he booted a ball outside the stadium.\n\nSzoboszlai returned later that summer with a point to prove and has been ever-present under Slot since - 2025 was the year he became a husband, father and a Premier League winner.\n\nThis term, he has already played more minutes for Liverpool than he did in 2023-24 and only 302 minutes short of matching his tally for the previous campaign.\n\n\"Obviously he has been very good [this season],\" added Van Dijk. \"He's also a player who I think can still make the next step in terms of being a leader for this team. It starts by leading by example and that's something he has done so far this season.\n\n\"But also everything around it, there is still progress to be made and that's a good thing in my opinion, so hopefully he will be very important for the years to come at Liverpool.\"\n\nWhen Klopp signed Szoboszlai - who had impressed at Red Bull Salzburg before joining RB Leipzig in 2021 - he said: \"This is a signing for our present and also for our future.\"\n\nLiverpool will be keen to make sure that remains the case.\n\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "A little chastened, you suspect, by his omission in the opening rounds of the Six Nations - not to mention being left out for the All Blacks Test in the autumn - and more than a little determined to make amends for lost time and for all the tries he might have scored. Against England, of course.\n\nIn putting some of the band back together - Blair Kinghorn also returning to 15 - Gregor Townsend's intentions are pretty clear.\n\nWales are shipping so many tries that Van der Merwe must be licking his lips in anticipation.\n\nThis game, more than any other game, looks like it's made for what he has to offer. What's that? A nose for a try like no player who has ever played for Scotland before.\n\nA running game that would see him power through reinforced concrete if there was a five-pointer to be had on the other side. A distraction for opposition defences. A fear factor, too.\n\nKinghorn & Van der Merwe return for Scots in Wales\n\nCostelow and Hamer-Webb start for Wales v Scotland\n\nHe hasn't started in a big Test match since France last March. He wasn't in the 23 for the marquee game in the autumn against the All Blacks and was only on the bench for the other box office encounter against Argentina.\n\nThe Six Nations has passed him by. This has been the toughest period of his career.\n\nWhat has ailed the big man? Injury, to begin with. Then, a lack of confidence. Then, a Lions tour that saw him score more tries than anybody else while never threatening to make it into the Test squad, as he did in 2021.\n\nAfter that, more injury and more shortage of belief. Rivals sped past him - Kyle Steyn and Jamie Dobie.\n\nThe malaise at Edinburgh has been a problem. Not just for him but for Darcy Graham, too.\n\nBeing a classy wing for risk-averse Edinburgh is like being a Ferrari on the M8 in rush hour. Fat lot of good your engine is going to do you when you don't have open road.\n\nScotland Rugby Podcast: Can Scotland repeat England heroics?\n\nYou would never say he was a forgotten man, but his return to the team to face Wales on Saturday was a minor surprise. It makes perfect sense, but not many expected it.\n\nFor Scotland, a fresh, focused and eager to please Van der Merwe is surely a good thing. For Wales, probably not so much.\n\nHe's Scotland's record try-scorer with 35 in 52 games; a 6ft 5in curiosity.\n\nIn the unforgiving terrain of Test rugby he has scored 0.67 tries per international which, frankly, is bordering on the obscene.\n\nHe has scored seven Six Nations tries against England, more than anybody else until Huw Jones overtook him last weekend.\n\nHe scores at a faster rate in Test rugby than he does in club rugby, which goes back, in part, to the way Edinburgh play and, in other part, to the way Scotland play.\n\nFinn Russell, and his ability to manipulate defences before putting the ball in Van der Merwe's hands, has been the making of the wing. Offloads and cross-kicks, Russell has laid them on a plate for him. Van der Merwe is a different beast when Russell is calling the shots.\n\nHe has appeared on two Lions tours; he was second leading try-scorer in South Africa in 2021 and leading try-scorer in Australia in 2025. He got hat-tricks on both tours.\n\nRichard Cockerill, the coach who brought him to Edinburgh in the first place, has called him a freak, which he is.\n\nNobody could legitimately claim that Van der Merwe, for all his power and pace and lethal finishing ability, is the complete rugby player. Absolutely, he is not.\n\nHe may have come a long way since fetching-up at Edinburgh and failing his medical.\n\nHe has progressed thrillingly beyond the point where Cockerill used to close his eyes when the ball was in the air anywhere near him for fear that he'd drop it.\n\nHe's flawed, of course. But the upside? Historic amounts of it. Tries by the bucket load - easy run-ins and monstrous solo runs.\n\nGive him a yard of grass and, as an opposition, best start saying your prayers.\n\nHis appearances at the Principality have seen the worst and the best of him.\n\nIn 2022, in what was a dismal Scotland defeat, the abiding image of him was a negative one, a man coughing up ball and looking a bit weak amid a battle.\n\nTwo years later, he was a total menace.\n\nRussell the creator, Van der Merwe the finisher, from inside the Wales 22 for the first and from a mile out for the second, an arcing run that Wales saw coming but could do nothing to stop.\n\nThey'll see him again on Saturday. Some of those Welsh players might see him in their nightmares before Saturday.\n\nVan der Merwe might see this is a second chapter in his Scotland's story, one that some felt might have been slipping away from him amid the excellence of Steyn and Dobie.\n\nRugby's brutality, and Dobie's injury, has opened the door to him again and he's not the type to knock politely. His way has always been to take the thing off its hinges. Wales won't need any warning about the danger lurking out there on the left wing.",

    "fullText": "Plans to change the format of the Women's FA Cup, which would have seen four sides seeded and pathways to Wembley mapped out from the last 32 onwards, will not be introduced next season.\n\nThe proposals, first reported by the Guardian, external this month, would prevent the top four sides from the previous season's Women's Super League (WSL) meeting until the semi-finals and end the use of draws from the fourth round onwards.\n\nThe Football Association (FA) had claimed it would create \"high chances of consistent high-quality matches throughout the later rounds\" and \"strengthen commercial potential\".\n\nBut several official supporters' clubs warned the steps would ruin the \"magic\" of the competition and see the biggest clubs \"only get richer\".\n\nThe FA says it has listened to feedback and will hold off changing the cup's structure while it gathers more views.\n\nAn FA statement said: \"We understand how much the competition means to clubs, players and fans across the pyramid, and it is important that all parties have enough time to share their views.\n\n\"As a result, we will be extending the consultation phase to allow for further engagement informed by the questions and comments raised.\"\n\nSheGulls, representing fans of WSL club Brighton & Hove Albion, had suggested seeding \"elite level teams\" would only widen the gulf in quality across the game.\n\n\"The sporting merit in our game is slowly being eroded in favour of 'super matches' between elite level teams,\" the fan group wrote on X.\n\n\"The rich will only get richer and teams up and down the pyramid will fade into obscurity with the knowledge that without tens of millions of pounds, they won't even sniff the big time.\"\n\nFulham Women Supporters' Club, whose side play in the fourth tier, labelled it a \"ridiculous idea\" and added: \"[It] goes against all the principles of the FA Cup. I'd like to see WSL teams actually come in a round early.\"\n\n\"And there goes the magic of the FA Cup! Subway Cup [League Cup] is a farce, now this?\" added Everton Women's Official Supporters Club.\n\n\"All about the money. Didn't take long to ruin the women's game too did it…\"\n\nThe Women's FA Cup currently follows the same format as the men's competition, with a draw following each round.\n\nThere is a preliminary round and three qualifying rounds featuring teams from tiers four to seven of the pyramid, with Women's National League teams entering in the first-round proper, WSL2 teams in the third round and sides from the top division a round later.\n\nThe proposals came to light less than a fortnight after a major revamp of the Women's League Cup was announced, with the competition set to get a new name and follow the format of the Champions League from the group stage next season.\n\n'Women's FA Cup revamp would ruin the magic'\n\nWomen's League Cup to undergo name and format changes\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

I am confident and feeling excited.\n\n\"The pipe is amazing.

    "fullText": "American superstar Alysa Liu added Olympic figure skating gold to her world title as she beat a standout field in the women's final.\n\nLiu came into the free skate in third place following a couple of errors in the short program, but produced a performance for the ages.\n\nAppropriately wearing a sparkly gold dress and performing to Donna Summer, she scored a staggering 150.20 in her free skate.\n\nIt pushed her to the top of the leaderboard with an overall score of 226.79, narrowly beating Japan's Kaori Sakamoto - who Liu beat to the world title last year.\n\nSakamoto, in her final performance before retirement, won silver with 17-year-old compatriot Ami Nakai claiming bronze.\n\nJapan's Mone Chiba finished fourth, ahead of Amber Glenn - who rose from 13th to fifth after an excellent free skate - while Russian champion Adeliia Petrosian came sixth following a fall.\n\nLiu, 20, becomes the first American Olympic champion in women's figure skating since Sarah Hughes in 2002, and the first USA medallist since Sasha Cohen in 2006.\n\nShe was playing catch up on Nakai - leader after the short program - and Sakamoto after Tuesday night following a mistake on her triple lutz where she failed to fully rotate in the element.\n\nBut there were no mistakes here with a truly showstopping routine that drew deafening cheers from the crowd.\n\nIt was a much needed boost for the USA, as their only gold in singles figure skating following Ilia Malinin's collapse in the men's event.\n\nMalinin was among those in the crowd who gave Liu - the alt girl with her iconic halo hair and lip piercing - a standing ovation as she wrote herself into Olympic folklore.\n\nIt completes a remarkable comeback for Liu, who previously quit the sport aged 16 after missing out on a medal at Beijing 2022.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nSakamoto meanwhile has to settle for silver as her stellar career ends without an Olympic crown.\n\nShe is retiring aged 25 having won three world titles and bronze at Beijing 2022.\n\nHer final performance here was to Non, je ne regrette rien by Edith Piaf, and Sakamoto must have no regrets about a performance in which all 12 elements were given positive grades of execution.\n\nBut it scored five points lower than Liu in the technical elements, with the American's routine judged to have been more challenging.\n\nSakamoto wept as she left the ice, but by the medal ceremony rightly looked delighted with another major honour.\n\nThat initial disappointment was in stark contrast to the joy of compatriot Nakai, who ends a phenomenal debut campaign with an Olympic medal.\n\nThe youngest skater in the competition, Nakai stormed to the top of the leaderboard following the short program and opened her free skate with a triple axel - a brutally tough element she is now making her trademark.\n\nBut Nakai stumbled on her triple lutz, which played a major role in knocking her down below Liu and Sakamoto.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nFor a while, it looked like American champion Glenn might have produced an all-time great Olympic comeback.\n\nShe was down in 13th following a disastrous short program which left her in tears after she missed her triple loop, meaning it was scored zero as an invalid element.\n\nGlenn - who is open about her bisexuality and criticism of USA president Donald Trump - has been a magnet for online backlash, and came out on Thursday in Milan with a point to prove.\n\nDespite suffering a heavy fall in the warm-up she attacked her free skate, including a triple axel to start then a complex triple loop and double axel sequence.\n\nShe punched the air at the conclusion, and even as she missed out on a medal she had the body language of someone pleased to have brought her best to the Olympic stage.\n\nThe same could not be said for Petrosian, who was aiming to be the second Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN) of the day to win a medal at Milan-Cortina 2026.\n\nThe teenager is under the tutelage of controversial Eteri Tutberidze - the coach of Kamila Valieva at the last Olympics - who was rinkside during Petrosian's pre-skate.\n\nBut the 18-year-old's medal hopes were all but dashed on her first routine as she attempted a quad toe loop but fell.\n\nIf she had nailed her complex routine, gold was likely. But instead Petrosian was left stony faced, and she exited the stage quickly when it was confirmed she had missed the podium.",

    "fullText": "Wherever Eileen Gu goes, her fans will follow. Headlines will too.\n\nWith five medals - and the opportunity for one more on Saturday - she is the most decorated female Olympic freestyle skier in history.\n\nBut she is also someone who transcends her sport, a 22-year-old global superstar with a bank balance to make your eyes water.\n\nChina fell in love with its 'snow princess' at the Beijing 2022 Olympics where, as the poster girl of the Games, she duly delivered.\n\nShe became freestyle skiing's youngest Olympic champion with her big air and halfpipe golds at the age of 18, and the first to win three medals at the same Games when she added slopestyle silver.\n\nLater that year, she was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world.\n\n\"I just like being the best. I've always wanted to do that,\" said Gu at the Milan-Cortina Olympics, where she has added two more silver medals to her Olympic collection.\n\n\"I wanted to be the best at math when I was in kindergarten, and then I wanted to get into the best high school, and I wanted to have the highest SAT score, and then I wanted to get to the best college, and I wanted to be the best skier I could be.\n\n\"Then I wanted to do every event, and then I wanted to win them all. When you get a taste of it, it's kind of addictive.\"\n\nThe two Chinese-American Olympians competing for rival superpowers\n\nOn and off skis, Gu is a high achiever in every part of her world.\n\nCalifornia-born and raised by an American father and Chinese mother, she attended private school in San Francisco and is currently taking a sabbatical from her studies at Stanford University, where she majors in international relations and previously studied quantum physics.\n\nShe is also fluent in Mandarin, and as a child would spend summers in Beijing.\n\n\"Sometimes it feels like I'm carrying the weight of two countries on my shoulders,\" Gu said earlier in the 2026 Games.\n\nIn 2019, at the age of just 15, she switched her sporting allegiance from the US to China, wanting to \"inspire millions of young people in Beijing - my mother's birthplace\" before the 2022 Olympics.\n\nWhatever her reasoning, it was a decision that proved lucrative.\n\nIn December, Forbes ranked Gu as the fourth-highest paid female athlete for 2025, behind only tennis players Coco Gauff, Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek.\n\nBut unlike those three, only a tiny amount of her $23.1m (£17.1m) income last year came from prize money from her sport - around $100,000 (£74,000).\n\nInstead, it comes through endorsements with brands such as Red Bull, Porsche and Tiffany & Co, while she has walked the runway for Louis Vuitton and Victoria's Secret and is signed by modelling agency IMG.\n\nIt also emerged in 2025, as reported in the Wall Street Journal, external, that Gu and another athlete were set to be paid a combined $6.6m (£4.9m) by the Beijing Municipal Sports Bureau.\n\nIn total, the two athletes were said to be paid nearly $14m (£10.4m) over the past three years by the Bureau.\n\nBut her decision to compete for China was also one that drew much criticism, not just because of China and the US' rivalry as the world's two biggest economies, but because of China's authoritarian Communist Party rulers and its poor record on human rights - which it denies.\n\nWhile the initial furore died down, it has raised its head again at these Games.\n\nAt the start of the Olympics, American freestyle skier Hunter Hess spoke out about the actions of the United States' Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) organisation and ongoing tensions in the US.\n\nIn January, intensive care nurse Alex Pretti, 37, and fellow Minnesota resident Renee Good, 37, were both killed by ICE agents in the city, sparking widespread protests.\n\nAsked what it means to represent the USA, Hess said: \"It's a little hard.\n\n\"Just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the US.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump responded to Hess' comment by calling him a \"real loser\", and Gu was one of several athletes who publicly defended Hess and others speaking out.\n\n\"As someone who's been caught in the crossfire before, I feel sorry for the athletes,\" she said.\n\nBut that enraged her critics, given Gu chose to speak out against Trump but has never criticised China.\n\nFormer NBA player Enes Kanter Freedom called her a \"traitor\", adding she \"was born in America, raised in America, lives in America and chose to compete against her own country for the worst human rights abuser on the planet - China\".\n\n\"You don't get to enjoy the freedoms of US citizenship while acting as a global PR asset for the Chinese Communist Party,\" he wrote on X.\n\nWhen asked about China's human rights record by Time magazine, external, in an interview published in January, she answered: \"I'm not an expert on this.\n\n\"I haven't done the research. I don't think it's my business.\"\n\nGu has 2.6m followers on Instagram, has amassed 11.7m likes on TikTok, and at the Livigno Snow Park high up in the Italian Alps, no athlete has more fans in attendance.\n\nClad in the red colours of China, they line the front of the fan areas, flags adorned with images of Gu's face pegged to the fences, and celebrate her every run like it has clinched Olympic gold.\n\nAfter every run, the ever-driven and disciplined Gu seeks out her mother, Yan, to review video footage on her phone. Yan, reportedly a successful venture capitalist who brought her daughter up single-handledly, is accredited at the Games and is the first person Gu celebrates her successes with.\n\nDuring Monday's big air final, Yan was seen watching alongside former International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach.\n\nAfter competitions, Gu is the one every media outlet wants to speak to, and she gracefully and politely obliges as she slowly shuffles through the mixed zone.\n\nBut it was from a press conference earlier this week that her remarks to a journalist went viral, when she was asked if she felt her two silver medals were actually two golds lost.\n\n\"I'm the most decorated female freeskier in history. I think that's an answer in and of itself,\" she replied.\n\n\"How do I say this? Winning a medal at the Olympics is a life-changing experience for every athlete. Doing it five times is exponentially harder because every medal is equally hard for me but everybody else's expectations rise, right?\n\n\"So the two medals lost situation, to be quite frank with you, I think is kind of a ridiculous perspective to take.\n\n\"I'm showcasing my best skiing, I'm doing things that quite literally have never been done before so I think that is more than good enough. But thank you.\"\n\nIn the lead-up to the Games, Gu did interviews with the likes of Vogue and Time magazine, but it was reports in the Swiss media, external that had the potential to further fuel a competitive rivalry at the top of the sport.\n\nIt was reported that the coach of Swiss skier Mathilde Gremaud left her team to join Gu's on the eve of the Games, just as he had four years earlier before Beijing 2022.\n\nAt those Games, Gremaud pipped Gu to slopestyle gold, while Gu won the big air title with Gremaud taking bronze.\n\nThis time around, Gremaud again won slopestyle gold, with Gu taking silver, while the Swiss star withdrew from the big air after a crash, with Gu going on to finish second again.\n\nBefore that big air final and as a result of reaching it, Gu had taken to Instagram to highlight a scheduling issue.\n\nIt meant, as the only woman competing in three freeski events, she would miss a full day of halfpipe training. After appealing to the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) for another opportunity to train, she said she had been turned down.\n\n\"This decision is disappointing to me because it seems to contradict the spirit of the Games,\" she said.\n\n\"Daring to be the only woman to compete in three events should not be penalised. Making finals in one event should not disadvantage me in another.\"\n\nBBC Sport understands Gu had already been handpicked as one of 10 athletes - five men, five women - invited to a halfpipe testing training session, while having three official training sessions is more than the usual two held before World Cups.\n\nIn a statement, FIS told BBC Sport: \"For athletes who choose to compete in multiple disciplines and/or multiple events, conflicts can sometimes be inevitable.\"\n\nSo serious is Gu taking these Olympics that she has brought 21 pairs of skis with her to Livigno, seven per event. Asked by BBC Sport how many she would normally take to a competition, she replied two or three.\n\nIn the halfpipe training she did do she looked in imperious form, and qualified for Saturday's final in fifth place, with Great Britain's Zoe Atkin, also a Stanford student, topping the standings.\n\n\"My sixth Olympic final. I am proud to have a 100% success rate,\" Gu told BBC Sport.\n\n\"It is not an easy thing to do. The Olympics brings out the best and worst in people.\n\n\"Being able to withstand that pressure is something I am really proud of.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Ukraine's Winter Paralympics team will boycott the event's opening ceremony next month after Russian and Belarusian athletes were invited to compete under their national flags.\n\nOn Tuesday, it was announced six Russian and four Belarusian athletes will take part in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing and snowboarding at the Milan-Cortina Games, which start on 6 March.\n\nBoth countries had previously been suspended from Paralympic competition after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with Belarus an ally of Russia.\n\nIn September, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) lifted its ban on athletes from the two countries competing at the Games.\n\nHowever, the IPC does not govern the six sports contested at the Paralympics and despite the individual bodies, including the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS), refusing to lift their own bans, Russia and Belarus won an appeal to the Court of Arbitration of Sport against FIS.\n\nAs a result, athletes have been able to return to FIS competitions and the 10 Paralympians have been awarded bipartite commission invitations to compete in Italy.\n\nFollowing an announcement that Ukrainian officials would avoid the entire competition, the country's National Paralympic Committee now says team members will miss the opening ceremony.\n\nThe organisation has also made a \"demand that the Ukrainian flag not be used\".\n\nThe team will still compete in the Games and \"fight for the sporting victories of Ukrainian athletes\".\n\nEarlier this week in its response to criticism over the decision to allow the Russian and Belarussian athletes to compete, the IPC said it was a \"democratic organisation and the decision to lift the partial suspension of NPCs Belarus and Russia was taken by IPC member organisations at the 2025 General Assembly\".\n\nIt added: \"At this meeting nearly 180 of the IPC's 211 members were in attendance and voted on this matter. We have to respect the decision of our members who come from all over the world.\"\n\nIn its statement announcing the boycott, the National Paralympic Committee of Ukraine described the IPC's decision as \"shameful\" and that it \"completely contradicts the principles\" of the Games.\n\nBipartite commission invites are granted to individual athletes, rather than their international federation, and allow the participation of top athletes \"who may not have had the opportunity to qualify through other methods due to extraordinary circumstances\".\n\nThe IPC, with the support of international federations - in this case FIS - decides who receives the bipartite slots after receiving recommendations from the federation.\n\nUkraine has also been awarded bipartite slots in three sports.",

    "description": "Formula 1 boss Stefano Domenicali calls for calm in the face of criticism from drivers of the sport's new rules - but said changes would be made if necessary.",
    "fullText": "Formula 1 boss Stefano Domenicali has called for calm in the face of criticism from drivers of the sport's new rules - but said changes would be made if necessary.\n\nF1's four active world champions - Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen, Fernando Alonso and Lando Norris - have all made disparaging comments about the driving experience of the new cars in one way or another.\n\nBut Domenicali said in a news conference on Thursday: \"We need to avoid overreaction because it's just the beginning of a new journey, so that's why I say we need to stay calm.\n\n\"And if there is something that is useful and can be implemented straight away, I've seen a very open approach by [governing body] the FIA and also the teams sharing their defined data of course with the others.\n\n\"It's a new concept where it has to be, of course, improved if needed.\"\n\nNorris admits new F1 cars 'not purest form of racing'\n\n'Just not F1' or 'a lot of fun'? New cars split drivers\n\nThe biggest rule change in F1 history has seen cars, engines and tyres all subject to change this year, in addition to the introduction of carbon-neutral sustainable fuels.\n\nDrivers have targeted the new engines, which require substantial energy management at all times for optimum performance.\n\nVerstappen said F1 was now \"like Formula E on steroids\", while Alonso added \"the chef could drive the car\" at the speed he was going around some fast corners to harvest energy, and Hamilton claimed the new rules were \"ridiculously complex\".\n\nBriton Norris, who initially defended the cars last week as \"fun\", said on Thursday he had made those comments to see the reaction and admitted they were \"certainly not the purest form of racing\".\n\nDomenicali, the president and chief executive officer of commercial rights holder F1, pointed out the new engine rules were conceived as an attempt to attract new engine manufacturers and had succeeded in attracting Audi and Cadillac, and persuaded Honda to reverse a decision to leave.\n\n\"The evolution of that is natural and will become normal,\" said the Italian. \"I am pretty confident this will evolve in a situation that, at the end of the year, no-one will remember what we are talking about today.\n\n\"We don't have to forget that, with all respect to all these technicalities we are taking about, it is something in the inner business of F1. [For] our 900 million fans, it is not in their business.\n\n\"What has to be protected is having great racing, great overtaking opportunities, great challenge to the drivers to show they are best. If these points are not taken, we need to intervene and restart immediately.\"\n\nDomenicali added he had been out on the track in pre-season testing in Bahrain on Thursday to see the cars for himself.\n\n\"The cars are really beautiful, the sound is very nice and if you go around the track here it seems that there is the car like it was last year and that's very important for the one that are very specific technical details to understand,\" he said.\n\nF1's bosses agreed at a meeting of the F1 Commission rules-making body on Wednesday they would assess data from this final test at a further meeting to decide whether action needed to be taken in the short term.\n\nConcern arises from the fact the new engine rules have tripled the power provided by the electrical part of the engine but left the batteries more or less the same size as last year, and removed one of the devices used to recover energy.\n\nThis had led to cars that are energy starved and forced the teams to find new ways to harvest sufficient electrical energy to produce the best performance. The rules governing energy recovery are also highly complex.\n\nThat in turn has required drivers to perform behaviours that have been described as \"counter-intuitive\" to optimise lap time.\n\nThese include not going flat out put of the final corner before a qualifying lap, lifting and coasting on a qualifying lap, and even not accelerating at full power at the end of a lap because it was more advantageous to use the energy elsewhere.\n\nHowever, drivers have generally been positive on the handling characteristics of the new cars, and a number of top drivers all told BBC Sport they are still driving to the limit of grip, and driver ability will still be as crucial as ever.\n\nDomenicali said: \"Don't be worried about the energy management. We're going to solve that. If we need to solve it, by the way.\"\n\nHe has spent his time in Bahrain having a series of discussions with individual drivers about the sport, including Verstappen.\n\nAnd he added: \"Max wants and does care about Formula 1 more than anyone else. He has a way of putting the point that he wants to say in a certain way.\n\n\"Max will be part of the future of Formula 1 and of course it's very important that we listen to him and all the top drivers that are very important in this sport.\"\n\nDomenicali also said F1 was looking at introducing new sporting elements on Fridays, expanding on the approach that led to sprint-race weekends, which feature two qualifying sessions rather than one, and a shorter race on the Saturday in addition to the grand prix on Sunday.\n\nHe has already previously said F1 is considering increasing the number of sprint events beyond the current six.\n\nDomenicali added: \"Feedback from the fans, from the people attending the track, the promoter, [is] that people want to see action, real action during the three days.\n\n\"People want to see already on Friday something that is sporting - qualifying, points, whatever it is.\n\n\"So, it is true that there is the trend to go in the direction of, even if it is not a sprint every weekend.\"",

It was a very good result. It is only half-time, we need to be consistent, the schedule is tight and difficult.\n\n\"Everyone must be ready to help the team. This is what I ask them.\n\n\"I realised before I came that the players have a lot of quality.

    "fullText": "Keely Hodgkinson has broken the long-standing women's indoor 800m world record, set by Slovenia's Jolanda Ceplak on the day the Briton was born almost 24 years ago.\n\nOlympic champion Hodgkinson crossed the line in one minute 54.87 seconds in Lievin, France, taking almost one second off Ceplak's time of 1:55.82 which had endured since 3 March 2002.\n\n\"Thank god. That was really fun, I was really looking forward to this,\" Hodgkinson told the crowd, before being adorned with a golden crown as she took her place on a throne beside the track.\n\nThe 23-year-old, who broke the rarely contested 600m record during her previous indoor season three years ago, joins triple jumper Jonathan Edwards as the only British athlete to hold a current world record in one of the sport's championship events.\n\nHodgkinson was primed to target the indoor 800m record at her eponymous Keely Klassic event in February last year, before her ambitions were ruined by the first of two serious hamstring injuries that season.\n\nSpeaking before Thursday's event, Hodgkinson said that Lievin was not just about the world record \"but seeing how fast we can really go\", after bettering her own national record by almost one second at the UK Indoor Championships on Saturday.\n\nJoined on the start line by Ethiopia's Olympic silver medallist Tsige Duguma and Switzerland's Audrey Werro, who Hodgkinson replaced as the fastest woman this year, Poland's Anna Gryc was tasked with setting a pace of 55.8 seconds through halfway.\n\nAhead of schedule after a 55.56-second first 400m, Hodgkinson strode off the front and never appeared in danger of losing touch with the green wavelights representing the record time on the inside of the track.\n\nAfter the desperate lows of her first year as the reigning Olympic champion, Hodgkinson has come out firing in her second.\n\nThe world record appeared to be on borrowed time after Hodgkinson opened her season with a 1:56.33 clocking in Birmingham five days ago.\n\nShe made no secret of her ambition to surpass Ceplak's mark on a notoriously fast track in Lievin following that statement performance, saying: \"I feel like it is my record to break.\"\n\nIt left Ceplak and Austrian Stephanie Graf, who set her best time in finishing runner-up to Ceplak's world record run in Vienna, as the only athletes ahead of Hodgkinson on the all-time list.\n\nThat mark had remained a controversial one ever since Ceplak, and indeed Graf, later served two-year doping bans.\n\nBut, 12 days short of her birthday, and the latest anniversary of Ceplak's record, Hodgkinson took down the record to which she has long attached a sense of destiny.\n\nHodgkinson became known as 'Keely 2.0' among her M11 training group, such were the developments she made in strength and power during her time spent in the gym recovering from two hamstring tears in 2025.\n\nThose significant setbacks, though challenging both physically and emotionally, did not prevent her from making the world podium in September following a 376-day wait to race as Olympic champion.\n\nWith an uninterrupted winter training block behind her - the \"healthiest\" she says she has had \"in a long time\" - Hodgkinson signalled in devastating fashion that she is ready to make up for lost time.\n\nAfter she won BBC Sport's Personality of the Year following her crowning moment at Paris 2024, Jenny Meadows, co-coach of the M11 training group alongside husband Trevor Painter, said an attempt at the sport's oldest world record would naturally follow once the indoor best was captured.\n\nIt is close to 43 years since Czech athlete Jarmila Kratochvilova set the outright world 800m record by running 1:53.28 in July 1983.\n\nOn this evidence, it may not be long before Hodgkinson, who has world indoor, European and Commonwealth honours to target this year, writes further history.\n\n\"She's absolutely obliterated that world record... What better way to head on to the world indoors,\" British former 400m athlete Allison Curbishley said on BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"A world indoor medal has eluded Keely in the last five years, so it's something she's desperate to get in Poland in a few weeks' time.\"\n\nRenee adds to Regis legacy with first UK title\n\nHodgkinson eyes world record after breaking British mark",

    "description": "AMC has opted out of screening the award-winning short film during its third-party programmed pre-show, and it’s unclear if other chains will follow suit.",
    "fullText": "When will AI movies start showing up in theaters nationwide?\n\nIt was supposed to be next month.\n\nBut when word leaked online that an AI short film contest winner was going to start screening before feature presentations in AMC Theatres, the cinema chain decided not to run the content.\n\nThe issue began earlier this week with the inaugural Frame Forward AI Animated Film Festival announcing Igor Alferov’s short film Thanksgiving Day had won the contest. The prize package for included Thanksgiving Day getting a national two-week run in theaters nationwide. When word of this began hitting social media, however, some were dismayed by the prospect of exhibitors embracing AI content, with many singling out AMC Theatres for criticism.\n\nExcept the short is not actually programmed by exhibitors, exactly, but by Screenvision Media — a third-party company which manages the 20-minute, advertising-driven pre-show before a theater’s lights go down. Screenvision — which co-organized the festival along with Modern Uprising Studios — provides content to multiple theatrical chains, not just AMC.\n\nAfter The Hollywood Reporter reached out to AMC about the brewing controversy, the company issued this statement to THR on Thursday: “This content is an initiative from Screenvision Media, which manages pre-show advertising for several movie theatre chains in the United States and runs in fewer than 30 percent of AMC’s U.S. locations. AMC was not involved in the creation of the content or the initiative and has informed Screenvision that AMC locations will not participate.”\n\nIt’s not yet clear if other theatrical chains will screen the short instead. Screenvision Media had no immediate comment, but the Frame Forward AI Animated Film Festival issued a statement from co-organizer MUS’s president and studio head Joel Roodman.\n\n“The national theatrical run, while truncated, is only an initial prize exposure for the winning film,” he said. “The film will be adapted for Celeste’s Massive Immersive theatrical venues, the first of which will be built in New York within the year. Shared theatrical experiences are an important cultural bond. The traditional theatrical chains are vital to our cohesion as a society, and are duly cautious [about AI]. However, the media landscape is changing and evolving rapidly. They may be prudent, but it is important to MUS immersive that new and exciting films, filmmakers, cinematic language, and spaces for these shared experiences continue to develop. We will bring new content, and important existing content, to our developing venue network of venues, starting in New York. We will not see the theatrical window wither on our watch.”\n\nThe film wouldn’t represent the first time AI content has played in theaters — a collection of film festival AI shorts from Runway’s 2025 AI Film Festival played in 10 Imax theaters in August. But this would likely be the first time a narrative AI film received nationwide exposure in cinemas rather than specialty screenings, and could represent another step in the groundbreaking technology marching into traditional Hollywood spaces.\n\nThe Thanksgiving Day film “follows a bear and his platypus assistant who are traveling through the galaxy in a spacecraft that looks like a dumpster. They have to deal with corrupt space-cops, hygiene officials, and a very unusual type of food delivery service as the story unfolds.”\n\nAccording to Deadline, Kazakhstani filmmaker Alferov used AI tools including Gemini 3.1 and Nano Banana Pro to make the short. Roodman said, “Thanksgiving Day is a masterclass in original storytelling, a wildly inventive journey that balances sharp satire with unexpected emotional payoff, proving that bold imagination with the tools of AI complements the future of animated filmmaking.”",

    "title": "Why Most AI Agent Directories Are Basically Useless",
    "description": "Let's be honest—most AI agent directories are just glorified link farms with the same 50 tools copy-pasted across them. Here's why that sucks, and what actually makes a directory worth your time.",
    "fullText": "Look. I've spent the last three months building AgentRank, and before that I wasted way too many hours scrolling through AI directories that all blur together into the same useless mess.\n\nYou know the ones. Pages and pages of logos, vague descriptions like \"AI-powered productivity tool,\" pricing that's always \"Contact for quote,\" and zero actual insight into whether the thing works or will waste your afternoon.\n\nIt's exhausting. And honestly? Kind of insulting.\n\nHere's what drives me nuts about 99% of AI agent directories out there:\n\nSeriously. Open three different \"AI tool directories\" and you'll see the exact same agents listed in almost the exact same order. ChatGPT, Claude, Jasper, Copy.ai. Cool. I could've Googled that.\n\nNobody's actually using half these tools. They're just scraping ProductHunt, slapping together a list, and calling it a day.\n\n2. The descriptions are worthless\n\n\"Revolutionizes workflows.\" \"Supercharges productivity.\" \"AI-powered innovation.\"\n\nGreat. What does it do? Can it write emails? Schedule meetings? Help me fix my leaky faucet? The marketing copy tells me nothing.\n\nI don't need your hype. I need to know if this tool solves my actual problem before I waste 20 minutes signing up and realizing it's useless.\n\nEvery listing is a press release. Five-star everything. \"Amazing!\" \"Game-changer!\" \"Must-have!\"\n\nZero honesty about what sucks. Zero comparison to alternatives. Zero \"this is great IF you need X, but terrible if you need Y.\"\n\nIf you're listing every tool as perfect, you're not helping me choose. You're just trying to collect affiliate fees.\n\nOh cool, another directory where everything is filed under \"productivity\" or \"AI assistant.\" Super helpful.\n\nI don't care that something is an \"AI agent.\" I care if it writes cold emails, debugs my code, or helps me find home repair contractors. Generic buckets don't cut it.\n\nHalf the listings are for tools that shut down six months ago or got acquired and nuked. Nobody's maintaining these directories. They're SEO graveyard.\n\nClick a link. Dead. Try another. 404. Great use of my time.\n\nHere's the thing—I'm not building AgentRank to be yet another link farm. I'm building it because I got fed up with the garbage out there.\n\nSo what makes a directory worth using? Here's my take:\n\nWhen I list a tool, I'm telling you what it's good at and where it falls short. Fixy's great for home repair DIY, but it's only on iOS right now. Claude's better for coding than ChatGPT, but costs more.\n\nHonesty. Specific use cases. Tradeoffs.\n\nIf I haven't actually used a tool, I'm not listing it.\n\n\"AI writing assistant\" doesn't help me. What I need to know is: Jasper vs Copy.ai for blog posts—which one gives me fewer robotic sounding paragraphs?\n\nReal comparisons based on actual use. Not feature charts, but \"here's when you'd pick A over B.\"\n\nI'm not filing Fixy under \"productivity.\" It goes under \"home improvement.\" Because that's what you'd search for when your toilet's running and you're trying to figure out if you can fix it yourself.\n\nContext matters. Use cases matter.\n\nDead tools get archived, not left to rot. Pricing is updated. Screenshots are recent. If something changed, the listing reflects it.\n\nNobody wants to waste time on outdated garbage.\n\nI'm not listing every AI tool that exists. If I wouldn't use it or recommend it, it's not going on AgentRank.\n\nThis started because I kept Googling \"best AI agent for X\" and getting the same recycled lists. Nothing useful. Nothing honest.\n\nSo I'm building the directory I wish existed:\n\nHonest takes on what's good and what sucks\n\nReal-world use cases, not buzzwords\n\nWill it be perfect? No. But it'll be a hell of a lot better than the copy-paste farms out there.\n\nI'm adding new agents every week. Real ones. Tested ones. With actual opinions attached.\n\nI'm also writing comparisons—head-to-head breakdowns of competing tools so you can make an actual informed decision instead of guessing.\n\nAnd I'm keeping the site fast. No 10-second load times, no popups begging for your email before you've seen a single listing. Just the info you need.\n\nIf you're tired of useless directories, bookmark AgentRank. Or don't—I'm building this for me either way.\n\nBut if you're as fed up as I was with the state of AI tool discovery, maybe you'll find it useful.\n\nGot an AI agent you think deserves to be listed? Drop me a note at hugh.e.mcinnis@gmail.com. If it's legit and solves a real problem, I'll test it and add it.\n\nNo press releases. No affiliate pitches. Just good tools that actually work.",

Detailed intelligence on machines, loot drops, quest lines, and weapon configurations.\n\nEven the smallest change in the ARC's behavior could mean catastrophe. And that signal you picked up? We've never intercepted anything like it before. If they're planning something, we have to find out what it is.\n\nOur food production is finally enough to meet our basic needs, but what we really need now is variety. I have a lead on some agricultural research from before the First Wave. Are you in?\n\nWe're short on everything but mouths to feed, yet Celeste's launching precious supplies into the air for Raiders to claw over. I'm done letting the good stuff go to waste.\n\nA comprehensive look at the tactical developments coming to Speranza in the first quarter of 2026. Discover upcoming map expansions, new machine variants, and major feature updates.\n\nThe first major stability and content update of the year. Patch 1.13.0 introduces machine behavior refinements, loot table adjustments for Stella Montis, and significant optimizations.\n\nThe database relies on field reports from raiders like you. Join the communications channel to submit data.\n\nWelcome to the premier database for ARC Raiders, the highly anticipated cooperative third-person extraction shooter from Embark Studios. Whether you are a veteran of the closed alpha or a new recruit preparing for the 2025 release, this Arc Raiders game guide is your essential companion. Our ARC Raiders wiki resource is designed to give you the tactical advantage needed to survive in the lethal world of Speranza. Our comprehensive toolkit covers everything from loot tables and crafting recipes to interactive maps and quest guides, making it the ultimate tool for every Arc Raiders player.\n\nIn the Arc Raiders game, survival is not guaranteed. As a Raider in ARC Raiders, you must scavenge for vital supplies, craft essential gear, and defend your squad against the ruthless ARC machines terrorizing the surface. Knowledge is your most valuable weapon in this Arc Raiders game. Understanding which loot to keep, which items to recycle for materials, and where to find rare drops can mean the difference between a successful extraction and losing everything.\n\nThe core loop of the Arc Raiders game revolves around three critical decisions: keep, sell, or recycle. Every item you find in ARC Raiders—from a broken alarm clock to a pristine ARC memory core—has a purpose.\n\nThe ARC machines are relentless. To defeat them in ARC Raiders, you must study their behaviors and weaknesses. Our database provides detailed intel on every machine type found in the Arc Raiders game.\n\nKnowing where to look is half the battle in the Arc Raiders game. Speranza is divided into several massive regions, each with unique biomes, danger levels, and loot pools. Understanding these zones is key to efficient farming runs in ARC Raiders.\n\nBest for: Batteries, Gears, Electronic Components, and Toolsets. Look for factories and warehouses. Essential for crafting ammunition and explosives in ARC Raiders.\n\nBest for: Antiseptics, Syringes, Bandages, and Stim-shots. Check field hospitals and pharmacies. PvP hotspots as every squad needs meds to survive the Arc Raiders game.\n\nBest for: Dog Collars, Valuables, Food, and Cosmetic items. Explore houses and apartment blocks. Great for solo players looking for quick credit items in ARC Raiders.\n\nBest for: Weapon Parts, Ammo, Access Keys, and Armor Plates. Expect heavy resistance. Often requires keys or hacking tools to access main loot rooms in the Arc Raiders game.\n\nProgression in ARC Raiders is deeply tied to your Hideout and your standing with Traders. Completing quests unlocks new gear, while upgrading your Hideout grants passive benefits and access to advanced crafting stations, essential for mastering the Arc Raiders game.\n\nAlways check your active quests before a raid. Many quests require specific \"found in raid\" items that cannot be purchased. Our Quest Guide lists all requirements and rewards, ensuring you never leave a raid without the items you need. Furthermore, mastering the workshop allows you to convert scavenged junk into lethal weaponry, a vital skill for any successful ARC Raiders raider.\n\nChoosing the right loadout for your squad is essential. In the Arc Raiders game, weapons define your role:\n\nFocus on collecting high-value trinkets (marked with a diamond icon) and completing Trader contracts. Residential zones in the Buried City map are often rich in sellable valuables in the Arc Raiders game.\n\nMost weapons are unlocked by increasing your reputation with Traders. You can also find blueprints in Security Zones which allow you to craft weapons at your Hideout's workshop, a core feature of ARC Raiders.\n\nNo, ARC Raiders is not free-to-play. Embark Studios shifted the Arc Raiders game from its original free-to-play model to a premium, paid experience, with a planned price point of approximately $40. The decision was made to ensure a better, more respectful experience for players, moving away from microtransaction-heavy models.\n\nWhile ARC Raiders is designed with squad-play in mind, solo play is fully supported. Solo raiders in the Arc Raiders game must rely on stealth and guerilla tactics to survive against larger groups and tough ARC machines.\n\nDisclaimer: This database is a fan-made resource for the Arc Raiders game community.

    "fullText": "NASA’s new boss blasted Boeing and the space agency Thursday for Starliner’s botched flight that left two astronauts stuck for months at the International Space Station.\n\nAdministrator Jared Isaacman said poor leadership and decision-making at Boeing led to Starliner’s troubles. He also blamed NASA managers for failing to intervene and get Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back more quickly.\n\nThe two test pilots, now retired from NASA, spent more than nine months at the station before catching a lift back with SpaceX last March.\n\nIsaacman said Starliner’s problems must be better understood and fixed before any more astronauts strap in.\n\nIn a sweeping and emphatic move, Isaacman upgraded the seriousness of Starliner's troubled astronaut debut, declaring it a “Type A mishap,” something that could endanger a crew. Both the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle disasters also involved cultural and leadership missteps. It is a mistake that Starliner was not designated a serious mishap right from the start, Isaacman said, citing internal pressure to keep Boeing on board and flights on track.\n\n“This is just about doing the right thing,” he said. “This is about getting the record straight.”\n\nThruster failures and other problems almost prevented Wilmore and Williams from reaching the space station following liftoff in 2024. The thruster analyses continue by Boeing.\n\n“We almost did have a really terrible day,\" said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya, referring to a potential loss of life.\n\nNASA issued its 312-page Starliner report while conducting a second fueling test of its moon rocket at Kennedy Space Center. Hydrogen fuel leaks spoiled the first dress rehearsal earlier this month and stalled astronauts' first flight to the moon since 1972.\n\nBoeing said the findings will help the company move forward in ensuring crew safety, and stressed that the Starliner program would continue. Time is running out as NASA proceeds toward decommissioning the space station in 2030, although Isaacman, a self-financed space traveler, foresees “endless demand” for multiple pathways to orbit once private outposts are booming.\n\nThere is no timeline for when Boeing can launch Starliner on a supply run, essentially another test flight to prove its safety before astronaut flights. The grounding leaves SpaceX as the only U.S. taxi service for astronauts.\n\n“Boeing has made substantial progress on corrective actions for technical challenges we encountered and driven significant cultural changes across the team,” Boeing said in a statement.\n\nEven before the troubled astronaut flight, Boeing was struggling with Starliner issues. The first test flight in 2019, without anyone on board, ended up in the wrong orbit and forced a repeat mission, which had its own difficulties.\n\nNASA hired Boeing and SpaceX in 2014, in the wake of the space shuttles’ retirement, to ferry astronauts to and from the orbiting lab. Their contracts are worth billions. SpaceX just delivered its 13th crew to the space station for NASA since 2020.\n\nKshatriya said the space agency must do better moving forward.\n\n“We have to own our part of this,” he said. As for Wilmore and Williams, “We failed them.\"\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Some posts linked to a Feb. 10, 2026, article in Texas Monthly (archived), which included a line that read, \"One of French's favorite phrases is 'third world savages'—which he has applied to Afghan asylum seekers, Muslims, and even Native Americans, who he also wants deported.\"\n\nIt is true that French called for the deportation of Native Americans.

He described (archived) Texas Tribune reporter Carlos Noguera Ramos, who wrote a story about French, as a \"soon to be deported journalist.\" Noguera Ramos' bio on the Texas Monthly website says he is Puerto Rican, which makes him a U.S. citizen.\n\nFor further reading, Snopes previously reported that French once spread the claim that voting machines in Tarrant County, Texas, where he was the Republican Party chair, flipped votes for Trump into votes for former Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.

    "fullText": "Nick Reiner has reportedly not yet received any visits from family members amid his stay in jail after being accused of killing his parents, Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner.\n\nRelatives are said to be keeping their distance as they are struggling to come to terms with the accusations against him while also mourning the deaths of Rob and Michele Reiner.\n\nThe accused is due to appear in court again on February 23, where he will be represented by a public defender following the sudden withdrawal of his high-profile attorney.\n\nBack in December, Nick Reiner was arrested for allegedly murdering his parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, at their home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.\n\nHe is currently being detained at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility, and according to reports, there have been no contact or prison visits from family members.\n\nSources have now explained why the family is keeping their distance amid ongoing legal processes ahead of Nick's murder trial.\n\n\"This isn't a misunderstanding or a minor scandal,\" an insider told Rob Shuter's #ShuterScoop. \"He killed their parents. That changes everything.\"\n\nAnother source described the feelings of the family as \"grief layered on top of horror,\" while suggesting they have yet to come to terms with the murder accusations brought against Nick.\n\n\"They're mourning their parents while also trying to comprehend what he's done. You don't just walk into a visiting room after that,\" said the insider.\n\nIn the early days of Nick's time in jail, he was placed on suicide watch, as is customary in such cases.\n\nThe alleged killer has since been taken off suicide watch and is now allowed to receive visitors if he chooses.\n\nHe is, however, unlikely to have any visitors, as some of his relatives feel it is too soon. This stance is also said to be unlikely to change, given the severity of the allegations against him.\n\n\"It's too soon — and for some of them, it may always be too soon,\" said one insider, according to the report.\n\nNick is the eldest child of Rob and Michele Reiner, who also have two other children, Max and Robbie.\n\nHis siblings and several of his other relatives have been forced to watch in shock as the family remains under intense public scrutiny while Nick awaits trial.\n\nFor all of them, the chosen approach is one of \"silence.\" This is reportedly not meant as a punishment or act of revenge against Nick, but rather as a way to establish a necessary boundary.\n\n\"Silence isn't about cruelty,\" said a source. \"It's about boundaries. It's about surviving something unthinkable.\"\n\nPreviously, it was reported that Nick's family was deeply concerned about the possibility of further details from his medical history being made public.\n\nAlready, claims of the accused being diagnosed with schizophrenia have swirled since his arrest, something the family never wanted, as they had intentionally kept these details from the public to protect.\n\n\"They've worked so hard to keep these issues private — no one knew about them,\" a source told Rob Shuter.\n\nIf more information about Nick's medical history were to come out, it is expected to deal a heavy emotional blow to the family, who remain deeply concerned about Nick, albeit from a distance.\n\n\"This is not just a legal case — it's a family tragedy,\" another insider shared. \"They're terrified of what happens if everything becomes public, and of the toll it will take on everyone who loved Rob, Michele, and Nick.\"\n\nNick is yet to enter a plea on the two counts of murder with special circumstances, but may likely do so when he returns to court on February 23.\n\nHe is currently being represented by a public defender after his high-profile lawyer, Alan Jackson, suddenly withdrew as his counsel during a hearing last month.\n\nThis forced the hearing to be rescheduled for the aforementioned date to give time to the public defender to get up to speed with the case.\n\nFollowing a plea, additional hearings are expected, along with other court proceedings such as the exchange of evidence between the parties, potential motions concerning the defendant's mental health, and arguments over the admissibility of evidence.\n\nEventually, Nick's trial will be held, and if found guilty, he could potentially face the death penalty.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A large banner featuring Donald Trump's face was hung on the exterior of Justice Department headquarters on Thursday in a physical display of the Republican president's efforts to exert power over the law enforcement agency that once investigated him.\n\nWhile Trump banners have been hung outside other agencies across Washington, the decision to place one on the storied Justice Department building amounted to a striking symbol of the erosion of the department's tradition of independence from White House control.\n\nThe banner, hung between two columns on one corner of the building, says, “Make America Safe Again,” a slogan used by the administration to tout its efforts to clamp down on illegal immigration and violent crime.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi has postured herself as the president's chief supporter and protector, eschewing the approach of predecessors who sought to maintain an arms-length distance from the White House to protect the impartiality of investigations and prosecutions.\n\nTrump officials have rejected accusations that they have weaponized the Justice Department for political purposes, saying the Biden administration was the one that politicized law enforcement with two federal criminal cases against Trump that were abandoned after he won the 2024 election.\n\nThe Justice Department in a statement Thursday said it is proud to “celebrate 250 years of our great country and our historic work to make America safe again at President Trump’s direction.”\n\nThe Trump administration has opened investigations into a number of the president's perceived enemies, amplifying concerns that the agency is being used to exact revenge on his political foes.\n\nFederal prosecutors brought charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey that were later dismissed, and separately sought to indict several Democratic lawmakers in connection with a video in which they urged U.S. military members to resist “illegal orders.\"\n\nIn a social media post, Comey said the banner was “sickening to see,” adding that the administration \"forgot to cover the inscription” on one side of the building that says, “Where law ends tyranny begins.\"\n\nThe department is also investigating Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over congressional testimony and Democratic Minnesota officials over whether they obstructed federal immigration enforcement through public statements.",

    "title": "Trump Wants Veterans to Lose Benefits As Soon As Their PTSD Symptoms Are Treated. There’s One Problem With That.",
    "description": "The consequences of this shift are not abstract.",
    "fullText": "During the troop surge in Iraq, I learned to constantly scan for threats, how to distinguish the sharp crack of a gunshot pointed in my direction from one outgoing toward an enemy, and the myriad ways that explosives can be hidden on a roadside. I learned that hypervigilance can be the difference between life and death. What I didn’t learn was how to turn it off.\n\nNow, I take three psychiatric medications every day, and I go to therapy every week. It’s taken a lot of work over the course of 15 years, but now I’m mostly functional. I raise my kids, go to work, and am part of my community. And I am among the nearly 5 million U.S. veterans who receive service-connected disability compensation, of whom roughly a quarter have a mental health condition such as post-traumatic stress disorder as their primary disability. That compensation is not charity, but compensation for harm incurred in service and a recognition that the government has a debt when the service it demands breaks bodies and minds.\n\nBut now, under a new interim rule issued by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the fact that medication helps me may also be used to reduce my disability compensation. The rule directs the VA to evaluate disabilities based on how veterans function with medication and treatment, rather than the underlying severity of their conditions. Essentially, if the pills work, good job staying alive; now move on without compensation for the inherent disability.\n\nThis issue was actually very recently litigated. Last year, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims decided Ingram v. Collins, a case that reaffirmed a rule first articulated in Jones v. Shinseki. The court was clear: When VA criteria for treatment do not explicitly mention medication-based improvements as a reason to discontinue disability benefits, the VA must discount the effects of medication and evaluate the disability as it would exist without treatment. That was not a radical interpretation but a straightforward application of the law. Treatment can mask symptoms, but it does not erase the harm. In response, the VA’s new rule asserts a blanket policy of considering the condition only as it presents under treatment, basically penalizing veterans like me for doing the work of staying alive.\n\nThe consequences of this shift are not abstract. Peer-reviewed research and VA data show that disability compensation is directly linked to real-life stability for veterans with mental health conditions. A long-term study following veterans who applied for PTSD disability benefits found that those who received benefits experienced meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms over a decade, compared with veterans who were denied. Those who received compensation were far less likely to experience poverty, with rates around 15 percent, compared to 45 percent among those denied benefits, and their risk of homelessness was nearly half that of denied veterans. Even years later, these differences in socioeconomic stability persisted, despite ongoing impairment. Compensation does not erase the injury, but it gives veterans the resources to manage it and live with it.\n\nI know the stakes personally. The medication I take does not erase the injury. When I have stopped my medication, the symptoms have surged back. I have found myself back in the dark place where I think that I would have been better off if the IED with my name on it that I had always been scanning for had actually gone off and killed me. I have buried too many friends whose treatment worked until it didn’t. Their medications stabilized them, and their therapy helped them, but the underlying injury remained. Now they are dead by suicide.\n\nThis is why Ingram mattered. It recognized that improvement through treatment should not cancel out evidence of injury. Symptoms managed by medication are still symptoms, and the underlying disability remains. The VA’s interim rule rejects this principle, allowing improved function to justify rejection of disability status.\n\nThe moral and legal logic of compensation is clear: It is not just about whether a veteran can work. It is about acknowledging permanent loss of quality of life that came as a result of their injuries. For example, in the civilian context, when construction workers fall off scaffolds and can’t walk until receiving surgery and physical therapy, their employers have to provide them workers’ compensation. It doesn’t matter if treatment can return them to full function and they can eventually return to work. The injuries occurred on the job, and the company has to provide compensation. “You break it, you buy it.” But for the Trump administration, despite its lavish spending on tax breaks for billionaires, military contracts, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement surges that are tearing the country apart, properly compensating veterans for sacrificing their well-being at the direction of the government is a waste of money that we don’t deserve.\n\nThe Trump administration’s interim rule fundamentally misunderstands both the law and the human cost of combat. Improvement does not equal cure, and functioning does not erase harm. VA disability compensation is not a paycheck. It is a recognition of veterans’ lives that will never be the same and a resource to help them pick up the pieces. The fact that symptoms can be controlled through daily maintenance medications is proof the injury is permanent and severe, not that medication can just make it go away. The law once recognized that distinction, and basic decency still should.",

Tim Torline, president of investments at Ducenta Squared in Los Angeles, said the rise can be attributed to a small slice of borrowers with higher original loan rates.\n\n“Refinancing activity is likely to be moderate in the near-term, with the market likely on hold until mortgage rates fall below the 6% psychological threshold,” Torline said in a statement.\n\nDiscover the best mortgage refinance lenders\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nHere are 8 strategies for getting the lowest mortgage rate possible.\n\nHere are today's mortgage refinance interest rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAs with mortgage rates for purchase, these are national averages that we've rounded to the nearest hundredth. Refinance rates can be higher than purchase mortgage rates, but that isn't always the case.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use as you shop for homes and lenders. Be sure to use the dropdown to include private mortgage insurance costs and HOA dues if they apply to you. These monthly expenses, along with your mortgage principal and interest rate, will give you a realistic idea of what your monthly payment could be.\n\nA mortgage interest rate is the fee charged by a lender for borrowing money, expressed as a percentage. There are two basic types of mortgage rates: fixed and adjustable rates.\n\nA fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you get a 30-year mortgage with a 6% interest rate, your rate will remain at 6% for the entire 30 years. (Unless you refinance or sell the home.)\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for the first few years, then changes it periodically. Let’s say you get a 5/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first five years, and then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 25 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and the U.S. housing market.\n\nAt the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. As time passes, less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed.\n\nLearn how to choose between an adjustable-rate vs. fixed-rate mortgage.\n\nTwo categories determine mortgage rates: things you can control and those you cannot.\n\nWhat factors can you control? First, you can compare the best mortgage lenders to find the one that gives you the lowest rate and fees.\n\nSecond, lenders typically extend lower rates to people with higher credit scores, lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and considerable down payments. If you can save more or pay down debt before securing a mortgage, a lender will probably give you a better interest rate.\n\nWhat factors can you not control? In short, the economy.\n\nThe list of ways the economy impacts mortgage rates is long, but here are the basic details. If the economy — for example, employment — is struggling, mortgage rates decrease to encourage borrowing, which helps boost the economy. If the economy is strong, mortgage rates go up to temper spending.\n\nWith all other factors being equal, mortgage refinance rates are typically slightly higher than purchase rates. So don't be surprised if your refinance rate is higher than you may have expected.\n\nTwo of the most common mortgage terms are 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages. Both lock in your rate for the entire loan term.\n\nA 30-year mortgage is popular because it has relatively low monthly payments. But it comes with a higher interest rate than shorter terms, and because you’re accumulating interest for three decades, you’ll pay a lot of interest in the long run.\n\nA 15-year mortgage can be a good choice because it has a lower rate than you’ll get with longer terms, so you’ll pay less in interest over the years. You’ll also pay off your mortgage much faster. But your monthly payments will be higher because you’re paying off the same loan amount in half the time.\n\nBasically, 30-year mortgages are more affordable from month to month, while 15-year mortgages are cheaper in the long run.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Finance's weekly survey of lenders with the lowest rates, some of the banks with the lowest mortgage rates are Chase and Citibank. However, it's a good idea to shop around for the best rate, not just with banks, but also with credit unions and companies specializing in mortgage lending.\n\nYes, 2.75% is an amazing mortgage rate. You're unlikely to get a 2.75% rate in today's market unless you take on an assumable mortgage from a seller who locked in this rate in 2020 or 2021, when rates were at all-time lows.\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac, the lowest-ever 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 2.65%. This was the national average in January 2021. It is extremely unlikely that rates will dip below 3% again anytime soon.\n\nSome experts say it's worth refinancing when you can lock in a rate that's 2% less than your current mortgage rate. Others say 1% is the magic number. It all depends on your financial goals when refinancing, how long you plan to stay in the same house, and on your break-even point after paying the refinance closing costs.\n\nWhat caused mortgage rates to fall this week?\n\nHow are lower rates affecting refinance activity?\n\nHow do 30-year and 15-year rates compare?\n\nWhat factors determine current mortgage rate levels?\n\nMortgage rates often decrease before a Federal Reserve meeting rather than after.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump appeared to be struggling to stay awake as others spoke at his inaugural meeting of the so-called “Board of Peace.”\n\nThe president, 79, rambled for more than 45 minutes before taking a seat on stage Thursday as others addressed the group gathered in Washington, DC.\n\nCameras repeatedly caught Trump with his eyes closed as the event dragged on.\n\nThe president’s eyelids appeared to grow heavy on Thursday as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair was speaking, less than an hour after the president took his own seat following his address.\n\nAt one point as world leaders spoke, he jolted back into a straighter position when applause rang out, snapping his eyes open.\n\nIt’s the latest in a series of public gatherings where the oldest president ever elected appeared to nod off in front of the cameras.\n\nThe president has defended his moments of shuteye during his meetings after he was seen dozing off at roundtables and Cabinet meetings at the White House.\n\nDuring his most recent gathering of top officials late last month, the president insisted he did not sleep through his December Cabinet meeting but argued he only closed his eyes at the previous gathering because it got “pretty boring.”\n\n“It was a little bit at the boring side, but I didn’t sleep,” Trump claimed at the time.\n\nHe also claimed the cameras had simply captured him during a moment where he was blinking, but the explanation conflicted with the moments being captured on video.\n\nTrump’s habit of closing his eyes while meeting with top officials and world leaders—followed by social media posting rampages in the middle of the night—has raised questions about the 79-year-old’s cognitive decline and fitness in office.\n\nBesides jolting up at one point on Thursday as Sheikh Jarrah Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah of Kuwait spoke, the president also appeared to be slumped slightly to the side with his eyes closed as the king of Bahrain spoke.\n\nEven resting his eyes would have been strange behavior after the president declared his “Board of Peace” the “most consequential board.”\n\n“There’s never been anything close because these are the greatest world leaders,” Trump declared in his comments at the top of the event.\n\nAt the end of the three-hour event, the president remained seated as other world leaders gathered around him as he signed the fundraising pledges. Trump then handed off the documents to those next to him to hold up, and handed out pens as if he were participating in a bill-signing ceremony at the White House.",

    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS (AP) — Katherine Eddington was driving in North Las Vegas last week when she thought she saw a big black bird carrying a banana fly across the intersection.\n\nBut after a closer look, she realized it was a toucan — a tropical bird native to rainforests in Central and South America known for their large, colorful bills.\n\n“They’re beautiful birds, so being able to see something like that so close to home was fascinating,” said Eddington, who recognized the bird from social media and contacted animal rescue.\n\nThat toucan is named Sam, and he has been living in the area since November, when a resident posted online that he'd escaped from his cage. After surviving the Las Vegas desert for months, Sam has captivated community birding groups, with people posting occasional sightings around town.\n\nA local rescue group has been trying to catch him for months — and the clock is ticking.\n\n“I’m really worried about him,” said Skye Marsh, president and co-founder of SouthWest Exotic Avian Rescue. The Las Vegas-based group has spent hours searching for him, only to find the bird 50 feet (about 15 meters) up in a palm tree, limiting rescue options. They have not been in touch with the owner, she said.\n\nLas Vegas is not a good environment for a toucan to be in the wild with its too-hot summers and cold winters, said Donald Price, a professor and biologist at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas who studies how winged animal species adapt to different environments.\n\nMarsh, who has two toucans of her own, said Sam is starting to show signs of struggle. His eyes are sunken in, and the skin around his beak is starting to get discolored, she said.\n\nSam likely lived off figs and pomegranates from trees in the Los Prados neighborhood, located about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip, when he first escaped in November, Marsh said. Those fruits have since disappeared, and Sam has moved on to citrus, which are harmful to toucans, she said. Their livers cannot process the calcium, and the iron can be deadly.\n\n“This bird is not in good shape,” Marsh said.\n\nBird experts and enthusiasts alike are surprised the toucan has survived so long in Las Vegas. Exotic birds that escape often have difficulty finding food and avoiding predators, and the changing weather in Las Vegas has also likely taken a toll on the toucan.\n\nBirds can thermal regulate, but only for so long. It takes a lot of energy, so the toucan would need more food, Price said.\n\n“If it’s still alive, it could be in trouble, I can imagine. So hopefully they catch it,\" he said.\n\nThe toucan has been spotted in one specific location, a sign he’s running out of energy, she said. The rescue group set up a cage with food in it and urged neighbors to stop feeding it. The toucan has scoped out the cage but gets spooked when people are around, Marsh said.\n\nThe rescue group will rush him to the vet as soon as he's caught, Marsh said. He’ll need fluids, and his system will need to be flushed to remove the iron he’s eaten.\n\nMarsh urged neighbors to not get close to the toucan or try to trap Sam themselves.\n\n“The more people that are out there, the worse it’s going to be because he doesn’t like people,” she said. “So just let us do our thing, and we’ll get him.”",

    "fullText": "As debate continues over AI’s true impact on the labor force, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said some companies are engaging in “AI washing” when it comes to layoffs, or falsely attributing workforce reductions to the technology’s impact.\n\n“I don’t know what the exact percentage is, but there’s some AI washing where people are blaming AI for layoffs that they would otherwise do, and then there’s some real displacement by AI of different kinds of jobs,” Altman told CNBC-TV18 at the India AI Impact Summit on Thursday.\n\nAI washing has gained traction as emerging data on the tech’s impact on the labor market tells a muddied, inconclusive story about how the technology is destroying human jobs—or if it has yet to touch them.\n\nA study published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research, for example, found that of thousands of surveyed C-suite executives across the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and Australia, nearly 90% said AI had no impact on workplace employment over the past three years following the late-2022 release of ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, prominent tech leaders like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have warned of a white-collar bloodbath, with AI potentially wiping out 50% of entry-level office jobs. Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski suggested this week the buy-now, pay-later firm would reduce its 3,000-person workforce by one-third by 2030 in part because of the acceleration of AI. Around 40% of employers expect to follow Siemiatkowski’s lead in culling staff down the line as a result of AI, according to the 2025 World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report.\n\nAltman clarified he anticipates more job displacement as a result of AI, as well as the emergence of new roles complementing the technology.\n\n“We’ll find new kinds of jobs, as we do with every tech revolution,” he said. “But I would expect that the real impact of AI doing jobs in the next few years will begin to be palpable.”\n\nData from a recent Yale Budget Lab report suggests Altman and Amodei’s vision of mass worker displacement from AI is not certain and is not yet here. Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Population Survey, the research found no significant differences in the rate of change of occupations mix or length of unemployment for individuals with jobs that have high exposure to AI from the release of ChatGPT through November 2025. The numbers suggested no significant AI-related labor changes at this juncture.\n\n“No matter which way you look at the data, at this exact moment, it just doesn’t seem like there’s major macroeconomic effects here,” Martha Gimbel, executive director and cofounder of the Yale Budget Lab, told Fortune earlier this month.",

    "fullText": "TEPETITLAN, Mexico, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Mexican authorities raided a tunnel used to steal fuel from a state-owned pipeline this week, offering a rare glimpse ‌into a long-running battle against a black-market trade often dominated by organized crime.\n\nThe 22-meter-long (72-foot-long) ‌tunnel was discovered outside a home in rural Hidalgo state near the town of Tepetitlan.\n\nIt led to two taps ​on an underground pipeline, the Hidalgo state attorney said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that security forces also seized drugs there.\n\nThe Hidalgo state attorney declined to elaborate on the announcement. A person familiar with the operation who spoke on condition of anonymity said there have been no arrests ‌so far in connection with ⁠the tunnel.\n\nWhile authorities did not name the pipeline, Reuters matched the site coordinates to an energy ministry map of hydrocarbon infrastructure, identifying it as ⁠the conduit owned by state energy company Pemex between the Tula refinery in Hidalgo to the Salamanca refinery in Guanajuato state.\n\nWhen Reuters journalists visited the site on Wednesday near the rural settlement of ​Sayula, Army ​and National Guard personnel were standing guard, and ​a banner reading \"property seized\" was posted.\n\nHuachicol, ‌as the theft and sale of fuel is known in Mexico, was originally the domain of local criminal gangs but has transformed into a violent, multi-billion-dollar business dominated by powerful cartels. It can involve gasoline, diesel and other refined products as well as crude oil.\n\nPemex did not respond to a request for comment. It reported the discovery of 11,774 illegal taps on its ‌pipelines in 2024.\n\nThe company said in a U.S. regulatory ​filing last year that efforts to combat the black-market ​trade \"have not produced sustained improvement in recent ​years.\"\n\nThieves usually dig long tunnels from private land to reach pipelines. The ‌stolen fuel is often sold locally in ​glass bottles or plastic ​canisters at a steep discount to petrol station prices.\n\nTunnels used to tap into pipelines often have elaborate engineering so fuel can be siphoned without causing pipeline pressure to ​drop enough to alert Pemex.\n\nThe ‌fuels are highly flammable and accidents occur, including an explosion caused by suspected ​fuel thieves that killed at least 137 people in 2019.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Trump administration has issued a sweeping new order that could lead to the arrest of tens of thousands of refugees who are lawfully in the United States but do not yet have permanent residency, overturning years of legal and immigration safeguards.\n\nA memo filed by the Department of Homeland Security ahead of a Thursday federal court hearing in Minnesota says refugees applying for green cards must return to federal custody one year after they were admitted to the U.S. for review of their applications.\n\nDHS “may maintain custody for the duration of the inspection and examination process,” said the memo, which was filed Wednesday.\n\nAdvocacy and resettlement groups slammed the order, which will likely face legal challenges and could sow confusion and fear among the nearly 200,000 refugees who came to the United States during the Biden administration.\n\nThe order is the latest in a series of immigration restrictions by the Trump administration, which has upended longstanding policies toward refugees, including dramatically reducing the number admitted into the country. A memo obtained by The Associated Press late last year said the administration was planning a review of all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration, and immediately suspended green card approvals for refugees who arrived during those years.\n\nThe administration has cited national security and economic concerns for its changed policies. Experts say refugees let into the country already undergo extensive vetting.\n\nThe new order came hours before U.S. District Judge John Tunheim heard arguments Thursday on whether he should extend a temporary order that protects Minnesota refugees lawfully in the U.S. from being arrested and deported. Tunheim’s order applies only in Minnesota, but the implications of the new national policy was a major part of the discussion anyway.\n\nHow many people could be arrested under the new order was unclear.\n\nJustice Department attorney Brantley Mayers said during Thursday's hearing that the government should have the right to arrest refugees one year after entering the U.S., but indicated that would not always happen.\n\n“That's a discretion call for DHS to make,” he said, a comment met with skepticism by attorneys for the Minnesota refugees.\n\nTunheim did not rule Thursday, saying he’d issue a written decision on whether the temporary order would be extended.\n\nAfter the hearing, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota said at a news conference outside the courthouse that the government \"failed to offer any coherent argument for their policy in either law or fact.” She wasn’t in court for the hearing, but said she'd been briefed about it.\n\n“And so we will continue the fight for justice in the courts,” Smith said, flanked by attorneys and refugee rights supporters, including U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar.\n\nImmigration advocates quickly pushed back against the new policy, with HIAS, an international Jewish nonprofit serving refugees and asylum-seekers, calling it “a transparent effort to detain and potentially deport thousands of people who are legally present in this country, people the U.S. government itself welcomed.”\n\n“They were promised safety and the chance to rebuild their lives. Instead, DHS is now threatening them with arrest and indefinite detention,\" Beth Oppenheim, the group's CEO, said in a statement.\n\nTunheim blocked the government from targeting the Minnesota refugees last month, saying the plaintiffs in the case were likely to prevail on their claims “that their arrest and detention, and the policy that purports to justify them, are unlawful.” His Jan. 28 temporary restraining order will expire Feb. 25 unless he grants a more permanent preliminary injunction.\n\nThe judge previously rejected the government’s claim that it had the legal right to arrest and detain refugees who haven’t obtained their green cards within a year of arriving in the U.S.\n\n“Mandating detention would lead to an illogical result,” Tunheim wrote, since refugees can’t even apply for green cards until they’ve been in the U.S. for a year. The government's interpretation, he said, means nearly all refugees would face detention unless immigration officials conducted their review at exactly the one-year mark, which he called “nonsensical.”\n\nRefugee rights groups sued the federal government in January after the government launched Operation PARRIS, an acronym for Post-Admission Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening.\n\nIt was billed as a “sweeping initiative” to reexamine the cases of 5,600 Minnesota refugees who had not yet been granted permanent resident status, or green cards. The agencies cited fraud in public programs in Minnesota as justification.\n\nOperation PARRIS was part of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown targeting Minnesota, including a surge of thousands of federal officers. Homeland Security called it the largest immigration enforcement operation ever. It sparked mass protests after federal agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens. White House border czar Tom Homan announced last week the surge was ending, though a small federal presence would remain.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that ICE officers went door to door under Operation PARRIS arresting refugees and sending them to detention centers in Texas, without access to attorneys. Some were later released in Texas and left to find their own way back to Minnesota, they said.\n\nTunheim noted in his order that refugees are extensively vetted by multiple agencies before being resettled in the U.S. He wrote that none arrested in the operation had been deemed a danger to the community or a flight risk, nor had any been charged with crimes that could be grounds for deportation.\n\nTunheim stressed that the refugees impacted by his order were admitted into the U.S. because of persecution in their home countries. He prohibited further arrests under Operation PARRIS and ordered that detainees still in custody from it be released and returned to Minnesota.\n\n“They are not committing crimes on our streets, nor did they illegally cross the border. Refugees have a legal right to be in the United States, a right to work, a right to live peacefully,” he wrote.",
