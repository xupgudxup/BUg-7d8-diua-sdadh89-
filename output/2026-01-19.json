    "description": "It was an ugly, brutal playoff win, but the Rams found a way. A defense that refused to break. From a team who cut their kicker, then called one to save their season.",
    "fullText": "CHICAGO — He emerged from the tunnel into a swirling, frozen gloom, with the whisper of an NFC Championship game wrapped in a wool hat.\n\nThe score was tied 10-10. His offense, listless. The grip on the season was as numb as the wet fingers frozen from heavy snow.\n\nSean McVay looked at his players, their breath clouding the frigid air, and delivered a three-word sermon that would become a prophecy, a plea, and a lifeline.\n\nWhat followed was 90 minutes of playoff football distilled to its raw, brutal essence. The Los Angeles Rams' 20-17 overtime victory over the Chicago Bears is a continued quest for redemption after their season ended a year ago in the Divisional Round.\n\nIn a contest where the Los Angeles Rams' most maligned units became their saviors, where their brilliant quarterback battled his own form, and where their meticulous coach nearly cost them everything.\n\nWhen the final, arcing kick from Harrison \"The Thiccer Kicker\" Mevis sliced through the gray haze and between the uprights, it was more than a game-winner.\n\nAll year, the Rams' special teams had been in disarray, a festering wound.\n\nKicks were blocked. Field goals sailed wide.\n\nThey fired their coordinator. They released a long snapper. They cut our kicker.\n\nThe move to Mevis was a desperate Hail Mary.\n\nAnd in this frozen hell, their kicker became a Godsend.\n\nHis 42-yard winner was an act of supreme pressure, a redemption arc written in ice.\n\n\"I felt really confident,\" McVay said. \"The weather had calmed down… I was very confident he would make that.\"\n\nThe operation—snap, hold, kick—was flawless in conditions designed for failure.\n\nIf special teams provided the final punctuation, the Rams' secondary authored the game's most defiant stanzas.\n\nA perceived weakness became an unyielding fortress.\n\nCobie Durant set the tone early, picking off Caleb Williams on the goal line. Kam Curl was a force, a sure-tackling missile whose night crescendoed with the play of the season: a leaping, game-sealing interception of Williams in overtime.\n\nIn a mix of awe and absolution, McVay exhaled, \"What a freaking play by Cam Curl,\" McVay said.\n\nThey played with a collective amnesia for their reputation, attacking the ball, confusing a young quarterback, and proving that heart can be a scheme.\n\n\"Our defense was outstanding,\" McVay said. \"They carried us tonight.\"\n\nThey had to because the offense and its architect stumbled.\n\nMatthew Stafford, the likely MVP, 1-9 in cold, rainy and frigid games since joining the Rams, fought the elements and a vicious Bears defense to a 20-of-42, 258-yard stalemate.\n\nHe was sacked four times. His rhythm, absent. Yet, when absolute clarity was demanded, he was crystalline. He found Puka Nacua, who was limited to 5 catches and 56 yards, for a critical third-down conversion in OT.\n\nHe dropped a dime to Davante Adams on the sideline—a throw Adams called \"a pinky-to-pinky catch\"—that required video review to believe.\n\n\"I tried to put it to a spot… he's as long as it gets at corner,\" Stafford said. \"What a hell of a catch.\"\n\nBut Stafford's path was nearly blocked by his own coach.\n\nWith a chance to ice the game late in the fourth, leading 17-10, McVay faced a critical third-and-1. Opposed to throwing for the first, McVay played it safe and opted to run the ball with Kyren Williams.\n\nThe play was stuffed. The ensuing Ethan Evans punt was shanked.\n\nBears quarterback Caleb Williams then authored his own miracle, a 51-yard heave to Cole Kmet for a touchdown with 18 seconds left.\n\nMcVay didn't hide from the error.\n\n\"I make a terrible third down and one call. No excuse for that. Should have used the timeout… I can be better for our group. I will be better,\" McVay said.\n\nHis honesty was as stark as the Chicago cold.\n\nYet, the Rams found a way. They always do.\n\nStafford, the grizzled gunslinger, is now one game away from contending for his second Super Bowl.\n\nThe only thing standing in his way—the Seattle Seahawks. A division rival. A house of horrors. The site of a brutal collapse just a month ago.\n\n\"It's a huge challenge to go play in Seattle,\" Stafford said. \"We've done it once this year, and what a hell of a game that was… I'm sure excited to be in this opportunity.\"\n\nIn the visitor's locker room, soaked in sweat and satisfaction, McVay's halftime command echoed.\n\nHis team found a way not by being perfect, but by being persistent.\n\nNot with an award-winning performance, but with a defiant, collective scream into the blizzard.\n\nThe special teams are reborn. The secondary, redeemed. The quarterback, resilient. The kicker, clutch.\n\nThey survived themselves. They survived the cold. They survived chaos.\n\nNow, they head north, with one more mountain to climb, the echoes of a simple command now their battle cry: Find a way.",

    "fullText": "SYDNEY, N.S. — American netminder Bianca Birittieri made an incredible 38 saves, while linemates Emily Pohl and Lindsay Stepnowski scored in the first and second, to help lead the United States to a 2-0 gold medal victory Sunday night at U18 Women's Worlds in Nova Scotia — and not just any gold medal world championship win at that.\n\nThe Americans reclaimed gold medal bragging rights, marking their 10th title at the IIHF Under-18 Women's World Championship, and did so on Canadian ice, in front of a sold-out crowd of more than 5,000 fans at Centre 200 in Cape Breton Island.\n\nNot only did they fight against a sea of red and white spectators and a strong, skilled Canadian squad, but according to the International Ice Hockey Federation, this American contingent is the first national under-18 team to ever win \"perfect gold\" at U18 Women's Worlds, which means the stripes and stars squad never trailed an opponent and were never tied throughout the entire week-and-a-half-long international tournament.\n\nThis was a history-making world championship.\n\nThe U.S. coaching staff told its team to \"do the same thing we've been doing,\" Pohl said to media of the stick-to-habits message she and her teammates followed throughout the tournament, since it proved so successful, and ultimately \"perfect\" in the IIHF stats.\n\n\"Obviously, I think we did it well,\" Pohl said, a big smile on her face and a gold medal wrapped around her neck, teammates Taila Hansen and Birittieri at her side.\n\n\"We just played fast, re-loaded(ed) pucks and just worked our hearts out,\" added Hansen, whose smile matched her teammates and message echoed what head coach Courtney Kennedy told media after the game.\n\n\"They've been training and buying in every day, all the time,\" said Kennedy, whose lineage hails from Glace Bay on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, slight tears forming in her eyes as she spoke of her late grandmother and family from the host province for the world championship.\n\n\"We were kind of hard on them in terms of trying to understand the system,\" Kennedy said. \"It's not a crazy system — it's literally play from your heart and play for each other, and they chose to do that, and... watching them today, they chose time and time again to play the right way.\"\n\nBut truth be told, while earlier tournament games featured large gaps between teams, in particular between the top two North American squads and their opponents, this gold medal game could have gone either way, with one single play able to make the difference at any time. As women's hockey followers know, this is par for the course between the long-time rivals.\n\nAs for starting Birittieri in the crease Sunday, \"there were saves she made that just stole the momentum... and you can just take the wind out of the sails of a team, and you need that, \" Kennedy said of why she picked her for the gold medal game.\n\n\"There's one save, one save in a game that can almost put the nail in the coffin, and she made that one save; I want to say it was on Milani on that left side, I was like, 'wow,' and you could just feel it,\" Kennedy said.\n\n\"Because that Canada team is incredibly talented and they did nothing but play their hearts out, too,\" she said.\n\nAs for Brittieri, \"it's always an hounour to wear the jersey, and to get the chance to play in the gold medal game and get the win is just incredible,\" the humbl goalie told reporters, flanked by Hansen, Pohl and their gold medals.\n\nBoth sides of the border stepped onto the ice Sunday night prepared, but Pohl's goal came early at 14:08 in the first on an assist from Hansen, and that set an intense but winning pace for the United States.\n\n\"She executed it perfectly; I just had to tap it in,\" Pohl said of the opening the scoring with help from her linemate.\n\n\"I was going up to the dot and was like what are we going to do,\" Hansen said of her assist. \"I was going to (put it back)... but then I was like, 'no, go forward,' and it worked out.\"\n\nHansen also helped out on Stepnowski's goal at 18:17 in the second period to seal the deal for the Americans, who were able to hold Canada's determined offence at bay through the remainder of the game despite the red and white crashing the net, pulling netminder Lea-Rose Charrois for 11 seconds late in the third in an attempt to create a scoring chance, and a much-needed timeout to strategize a potential late-game comeback — which is always possible when Canada and the United States face off.\n\nFor her part, Lea-Rose Charrois made 25 saves to help keep Canada in the game.\n\n\"We started really strong,\" Canadian head coach Vicky Sunohara said in the mixed zone. \"The skating, puck in deep, the forechecking. I thought we had opportunities, but we didn't bury the puck ,and there were times when we shot when we didn't have anybody driving the net, and gave their goalie confidence; didn't really challenge her.\n\n\"I think for the most part, though, you get one in and it could change the momentum,\" Sunohara agreed with a single play potentially changing the game.\n\n\"I thought we gave it everything we had; they're a very good team and they worked hard for 60 minutes, so I'm not taking anything away from them.\"\n\n\"I think as a group we did reallly well,\" agreed Canadian captain Hayley McDonald, a silver medal around her neck despite a tear-stained face.\n\n\"It's truly an honour to play not just for your country, but on home turf, and having this game sold out is amazing,\" she said.\n\nBut Canada's best efforts couldn't stop the U.S. from its \"perfect gold\" at the 2026 rematch of U18 worlds past.\n\nThe IIHF also handed out its individual awards after Sunday's gold medal game, with 16-year-old American forward Jane Daley of Medfield, Mass., winning most valuable player for her 12 goals and oustanding offence on behalf of the world champions.\n\nLeading the All-Star Team, which was voted on by accredited media attending the event, she was joined by American captain and defender Margaret Averill, along with Canadian forwards Adrianna Milani and Sofia Ismael, as well as red and white blueliner Megan Mossey.\n\nTop goalie honours went to Switzerland's Norina Schrupowski, who made 149 saves on a whopping 159 shots to post an impressive 93.71 save percentage over 227 minutes between the crease, according to IIHF official stats.\n\nThe IIHF Directorate also handed out awards, including Best Goalkeeper to Schrupowski, Best Defender to Averill and Best Forward to Daley.\n\n\"USA Hockey has a really high standard and they recruit the best players,\" Hansen said of the philopshy behind the American road to gold, which could set the standard for what happens on the ice at the 2026 Olympic Winter Games in Milano, Italy.\n\n\"The coaches, the staff, everyone,\" she said. \"I think just buying into what they say and doing it for each other, they really preach that, doing it for the teammate next to you, holding that rope for them... that kind of sets the standard, and everyone knows that at all levels.\"",

    "description": "Williams: Luke Brennaman is all in on being a Brennaman. And Marty and Thom are all in on the Indiana University junior's broadcasting aspirations.",
    "fullText": "You have a lot of melodrama in you, Luke. This is a (bleeping) baseball game, not World War III.\n\nYou rose to the occasion, Luke. You were really close to perfection. So happy for you.\n\nJust a sampling of the daily text messages that aspiring play-by-play man Luke Brennaman receives from his baseball hall-of-fame broadcasting grandfather, who even Luke affectionately calls Marty. The texts are equal parts educational, entertaining, critical and complimentary – and 100 percent Marty Brennaman.\n\nLuke Brennaman has gone all in on being a Brennaman. And so Marty and Luke’s dad, broadcaster Thom Brennaman, have gone all in on helping the third member of their family try to reach his goal of becoming a big-league broadcaster someday.\n\nThat journey continues Monday night in Miami, where 20-year-old Luke will call the national championship game between the Indiana Hoosiers and Miami Hurricanes for IU’s student radio station. Luke, a Mariemont High graduate, is a junior in IU's broadcasting program. He is the student radio station's co-sports director and also does work for the student television station.\n\nMarty and Thom will be intently tuned into WIUX-FM 99.1, excited to hear the next step in Luke's journey to potentially making the Brennamans just the second family to have at least three generations of big-league baseball broadcasters. The family of Chicago Cubs legend Harry Caray has had four generations of major-league broadcasters.\n\nThe national championship game will be a broadcasting milestone for the Brennamans. Luke will do what his father once did for Fox back in the BCS days and call a national championship game. No other father and son have broadcast a national college football championship game, Thom believes. Thom, who now calls college games for the CW Network and hosts the morning drive talk show on 700 WLW, called three BCS title games.\n\nLet's go ahead and get this out of the way: Luke isn't counting on the family name to get him to the big leagues. His biggest champions are also his biggest critics, starting with Marty, who also pulls no punches with his grandson.\n\n\"Maybe down the road the last name will make a difference,\" Marty told me in an interview last summer. \"But I told Luke, ‘Don’t think that’s going to allow you to skate into a situation. It boils down to what kind of talent you got.’ \"\n\nMarty continued: \"He has a great passion for being good. He’s very professional. He works at it. He has talent.\"\n\nMarty constantly texts Luke during IU football broadcasts, even calls him at halftime or immediately after the broadcast to give feedback. The \"you rose to the occasion\" text came right after Luke finished calling Indiana's Rose Bowl win against Alabama.\n\n\"You get that text, and it’s like, ‘Wow, this is livin’ right here,’ ” Luke said.\n\nLuke is confident like Marty and Thom. Thom worries about Luke staying humble. Marty's texts help take care of that.\n\nMarty invented brutal honesty in broadcasting during his 46 years calling Cincinnati Reds games on radio, and those texts weren't always so glowing last summer. Luke had landed an unpaid job calling games in the Cape Cod Baseball League, a collegiate wooden-bat summer league. It's not just for college baseball players, but also aspiring broadcasters.\n\nWhen Luke landed the job, which typically goes to college seniors, he realized big-time broadcasting could actually be in his future. Marty and Thom realized it, too, and changed their approach. They've never pushed Luke to pursue broadcasting, but the Cape Cod League job made Marty and Thom have serious conversations with Luke about what it really takes.\n\n\"They were always, 'Do as much as you can, but figure out if you like it,' \" Luke said. \"Early in my sophomore year, I decided I really like this, but wondered when am I going to get good at it? They did such a good job of guiding me and letting me figure it out on my own.\"\n\nLuke added: \"The feedback was always, ‘You did great.’ Then I got the Cape Cod League job. The critique went from 'we're glad you're doing it' to Marty saying: 'What the (bleep) does \"on the bump mean\"? Never say that again.' \"\n\nLuke came home from IU after spring semester for three weeks before heading off to New England to call 44 games in 55 days for the Harwich Mariners. Those three weeks were better than any college course.\n\n\"My dad told me, 'If you’re going to call baseball, you have to know baseball. Do you know how the infield fly works? Well, you better or else you’re going to get eaten alive.’ He said, 'You’re not ready.' He was feeling the magnitude of this. I bought a book called 'The Baseball Thesaurus' and I bought in.\"\n\nLuke and Thom started calling games in the family's Terrace Park living room each night. Luke had to be there at 6 p.m. They'd turn on random games on MLB's television package, mute the TV, call the game radio style and \"annoy the hell out of my mom,\" Luke said. Luke was play-by-play. Thom was color analyst. If the game went to commercial, they'd click to a different game and keep going.\n\n\"I got addicted to it,\" Luke said. \"We'd call four straight innings and get dinner. Then I'd tell my dad, 'Come on, give me three more innings.' \"\n\nThey took the show on the road to Great American Ball Park. Thom, the former long-time TV play-by-play voice of the Reds, arranged with the team to use an empty TV/radio booth for him and Luke to do a practice broadcast. They called two Reds games from the ballpark and recorded them.\n\nLuke learned nuances, such as referring to a pitch count by saying \"2-and-1\" rather than \"2 balls and 1 strike\" – little things to make the broadcast more concise.\n\nLuke believes he wouldn't have made it through the summer without those sessions with dad. Marty and Thom listened to all of Luke's Cape Cod broadcasts. Marty and his wife, Amanda, visited Luke in New England.\n\nOne of Marty's big lessons is not getting overly excited about meaningless plays early in a game. That's where the \"World War III\" text came in, when Marty heard Luke get too excited about an inconsequential walk. Marty was as tough on Luke as he was on some of those Reds players and managers.\n\n\"I called my dad and said, 'If Marty keeps telling me not to say stuff, I may have to go on the air and not speak,' \" Luke said, laughing.\n\nLuke doesn't necessarily look to emulate Marty or Thom on air. He's studied his dad much more than he has Marty. Growing up, it was only natural to watch the Reds on TV in the living room and not listen much on the radio. Luke loves his dad's style, and several times a week goes on YouTube and rewatches clips from Thom's days calling the NFL and college football for Fox and Reds games.\n\nLuke also makes sure to watch his dad call ACC football and basketball games on The CW.\n\n\"I’ve loved my dad’s ability to be a critical of a manager,\" Luke said. \"He’s only able to do that because he knows the game so well. The one thing I’ve taken from both my dad and Marty: I love how they were both so confident in everything they said on the air. That is something my dad ingrained me.\"\n\nContact columnist Jason Williams at jwilliams@enquirer.com\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Marty Brennaman's texts inspire grandson at Indiana University",

    "fullText": "Bears QB Caleb Williams leaves NFL fans speechless with viral USC Houdini-like TD vs. Rams originally appeared on The Sporting News.

The Bears put together one last drive late in the fourth quarter, needing to convert a fourth-and-4 to keep the season afloat. Twenty-seven seconds remained in regulation, as Williams went to work.\n\nWilliams avoided pressure, scrambling to find tight end Cole Kmet in the back left corner of the end zone to keep the season alive for a bit longer.\n\nThe pass, reminiscent of those that led Williams' Bears to victories against the Packers in Week 16 and the NFC Wildcard Playoffs, has gone viral again.\n\nAnd again, a moment Chicago fans won't forget has to be seen to be believed for those who have not.\n\nMore: Is Fernando Mendoza the model QB?

    "fullText": "The Michael Carrick era began in glorious fashion, as Manchester United overpowered noisy neighbours Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday.\n\nWhat the new caretaker head coach got spot on was his tactics and his utilisation of the squad. For far too long under Ruben Amorim, round pegs have been shoved into square holes.\n\nBut not the legendary midfielder. He played players in their natural positions, as seen from Bruno Fernandes occupying the No.10 position behind the striker and playing a free role like he used to under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nThe Portuguese was at the centre of everything good, and also picked up an assist for the first goal scored by Bryan Mbeumo.\n\nDespite the stunning return to form, the club captain is reportedly open to leaving in the summer, having grown disillusioned with the owners and the project.\n\nINEOS were said to be open to his departure last summer as well, and there is plenty of interest from both within Europe and the Saudi Pro League.\n\nBut if the Portugal international leaves, the Red Devils will need an incredible signing to offset the loss. And as per SportsBoom, the Red Devils feel Morgan Gibbs-White would be the perfect attacking signing.\n\nThe 20-time English league champions were even ready to invest in January, but given Nottingham Forest’s precarious league form, they will not sell their talisman this month.\n\nBut they are fully aware that United will return in the summer, and they will find competition in the form of Chelsea.\n\nForest are likely to demand a staggering €80-85 million for the England international, whether they receive such a high fee remains to be seen.\n\n25/26 season stats via Transfermarkt\n\n“Nottingham Forest are standing firm over the future of their star midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White. The club hierarchy has made it clear that the player is not for sale in the January transfer window, despite persistent interest from Premier League giants Manchester United and Chelsea.\n\n“However, fresh updates from sources close to the situation suggest that Manchester United and Chelsea have been tracking the playmaker for a long time. Both clubs are expected to renew their efforts in the summer window.\n\n“Manchester United are reportedly in the market for a creative spark in the final third, while Chelsea’s strategy of building a young, dynamic squad keeps Morgan Gibbs-White high on their shortlist.\n\n“From a financial perspective, if a move eventually materialises, the valuation is expected to reach a staggering €80-85 million.”\n\nThe 25-year-old already has six goals and three assists to his name despite Forest’s struggles, while last season, he registered seven goals and 10 assists.\n\nMorgan Gibbs-White could prove an astute signing, but not for the price being quoted. He is not the only Forest player on the club’s radar with INEOS likely to go after Elliot Anderson to solve their midfield woes.\n\nFeature image Clive Brunskill via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Despite leaving Liverpool as one of the most highly regarded coaches in world football in 2024, Jurgen Klopp said he never thought of himself as amongst the game's best.\n\n\"I never considered myself a world-class coach,\" Klopp told AFP and other media in an interview in Leipzig, \"because I still had so many questions when I finished.\"\n\n\"I was like 'how can I be world-class with these questions still?'\"\n\nAfter starting out at Mainz, where he took the club to the top flight for the first time, Klopp moved to Borussia Dortmund, where he won two Bundesliga titles and reached the 2013 Champions League final.\n\nAfter signing with Liverpool in 2015, Klopp's Reds won every trophy on offer, including the Champions League and Premier League.\n\nIn his new role as Red Bull's global head of football, where he oversees a multi-club structure with teams including RB Leipzig, New York Red Bulls and Paris FC, Klopp said that he wants to help coaches answer those questions.\n\n\"My role with the coaches is to be the guy I never had. I sat in my office very, very, very often, very, very, very alone.\n\n\"A lot of people gave me advice and have great ideas... It's great to have ideas, but it's really not that easy to make the final decision.\n\n\"I want to be in moments when I know they are alone, or feel alone. I want to be there.\"\n\nKlopp oversaw the firing of then-Leipzig coach Marco Rose, a long-time friend, in 2025 and said that being on the other side felt odd.\n\n\"Grave-digger of the coaches -- that's a title I never wanted to win!\"\n\n- 'I never watch the goals back' -\n\nFrom taking Mainz to the Bundesliga to breaking Liverpool's Premier League drought, Klopp improved clubs and players wherever he went.\n\nOften taking over with teams at a low ebb, the coach would try and put things in perspective.\n\n\"How did I start a game? I would say 'the worst news is you can lose it' -- so let's try and win it... Do not try to avoid defeat -- try to win.\"\n\nThe coach said he told his players: \"Giving your all doesn't mean you will get anything, but it's your only chance to get something. That's pretty much how you do it.\n\n\"We gave everything -- and sometimes we got something.\"\n\nKlopp said that media and fans were too focused on results.\n\n\"I never watch the goals back, because I want to understand the game to the left and the right of the result.\n\n\"I want to understand why it happened... Results are the result of the performance. So we worked on the performance and the results came later.\"\n\nThe 58-year-old said that he \"didn't take any pride\" out of trophy ceremonies and parades.\n\n\"I love being a part of it, not in the middle of it. You might see pictures where someone gave me a trophy and I'd take it, but I didn't need to touch it.\n\n\"For me, it was the journey that I loved. That gave me much more than the moment (of winning).\"\n\n- 'You know if Jurgen Klopp is in the room' -\n\nKlopp retains cult-like status at his former clubs, with fans remembering the German for his sideline antics and everyman appeal as much as his successes.\n\nRB Leipzig sporting director Marcel Schaefer told AFP that Klopp has brought the same presence into his new role, even if he is no longer on the sideline.\n\n\"He has something that is unique. He has a god-given talent which everyone knows from his coaching jobs.\n\n\"He can catch people in five to 10 minutes.\"\n\nSchaefer said that Klopp plays an important role in player recruitment by \"talking to families, talking to players about our vision, about our project.\n\n\"You know if Jurgen Klopp is in the room.\"\n\nSince stepping down at Anfield, Klopp has been linked to an array of high-profile coaching jobs, but said that a return to the dugout is unlikely.\n\n\"I don't expect to change my mind, but I don't know.\n\n\"We're building a house right now and my missus wanted to have a really big trophy room. There was another small room and I said 'this is enough, because we know how many trophies we have, we will not add any'.\n\n\"It might sound arrogant, but I know I can coach a football team. But I don't need to do it until my last day.\"",

    "fullText": "It already seems clear Real Madrid coach Alvaro Arbeloa believes success with the record 15-time European champions will only come with the careful management of egos at the club.\n\nLos Blancos host Monaco on Tuesday in the Champions League as they bid to consolidate their position in the top eight of the league phase and put a turbulent spell behind them.\n\nThe Spanish Super Cup defeat by Barcelona in Xabi Alonso's last game at the helm and Arbeloa's debut Copa del Rey humiliation shook the club, with fans exhibiting their feelings on Saturday as they whistled their own players.\n\nMadrid beat Levante 2-0 in La Liga but there was an immense show of dissent, with Arbeloa and star players Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham notably in the firing line.\n\nArbeloa's predecessor Alonso's downfall started when, despite beating Barcelona in the Clasico in October, he substituted Vinicius and the Brazilian responded furiously.\n\nAlonso also upset Fede Valverde by playing him at out of position and rotated Jude Bellingham, until eventually the pressure on him from within the dressing room told.\n\nThe Basque coach returned Vinicius and Bellingham to their near-untouchable star status, results did not follow and eventually Alonso was forced out.\n\nArbeloa's approach seems to be to lavish the club's most talented players with the kind of affection shown by Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane during their successful stints at the club.\n\nEven though Vinicius struggled in the cup exit at second-tier Albacete, Arbeloa hailed the forward, to a near-absurd degree considering the circumstances.\n\n\"(He wanted) to carry the team on his shoulders, to attack and never hide, that's the Vini I want to see,\" said Arbeloa.\n\nHe followed that up by highlighting Vinicius's previous achievements after he was whistled against Levante, insisting the way forward was to feed him at every opportunity.\n\n\"I'll ask his team-mates to find him more, give him the ball as much as possible,\" said Arbeloa. \"I am proud to be his coach.\"\n\nBellingham was extremely poor against Barca in the Spanish Super Cup final and has scored once in his last 11 games.\n\n\"Up close he's even better than on television, his experience, maturity, leadership...\" said Arbeloa of the Englishman on Saturday.\n\n\"He's one of the team's leaders, the same as Kylian, Vini or Fede. They are players called on to do great things for Real Madrid... when things aren't going well, we have to look for them continuously... we have to make them happy.\"\n\nIt is not just the players under him whom Arbeloa has to take care of, but also president Florentino Perez above.\n\nAsked about some fans chanting for the president to resign, Arbeloa changed his tune somewhat regarding the atmosphere at the Bernabeu, having said supporters had the right to express themselves.\n\n\"(The whistles) aren't from people who don't love Florentino, they are from people who don't love Real Madrid,\" said Arbeloa, laying bare his loyalty to the Madrid chief.\n\n\"We're lucky to have a president who is the most important person, along with Santiago Bernabeu, in the history of this club.\"\n\nOne player who was not targeted by Madrid's fans on Saturday is top goalscorer Kylian Mbappe.\n\nUnlike many of his team-mates the French superstar has had no performance issues this season, netting 30 goals in 26 games across all competitions.\n\nMbappe played against Levante, despite initially being expected to miss the game while recovering from a knee sprain, winning and converting a penalty for the opener.\n\nBarring any setbacks, Mbappe should start against his former side on Tuesday, looking to extend his lead at the top of the European scoring chart.\n\nDespite Mbappe's knee issue Arbeloa did not substitute him or any of the team's main stars against Levante, evading the pitfalls of his predecessor.\n\nHowever once the team's leaders and stars are happy, making them perform together is another question entirely.\n\nIt is a jigsaw puzzle Ancelotti could not solve in his last season, nor Alonso in the months he had at the helm.\n\nWhen Vinicius and Bellingham were the main attackers, Madrid had enough balance to win a La Liga and Champions League double in 2024. Mbappe's subsequent arrival left the team top-heavy.\n\nWith the situation around the club a little calmer, the Monaco game could offer a glimpse into how Arbeloa plans to get the attackers to click without betraying the defence behind them.",

    "description": "The Lakers got a much-needed win on Sunday against a strong Raptors squad.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Lakers' recent extended slump continued on Saturday when they lost 132-116 to the Portland Trail Blazers. In that game, they were without Luka Doncic, Denadre Ayton and Jaxson Hayes, but all three returned to action on Sunday when they hosted the Toronto Raptors.\n\nThe Raptors came into Sunday's game with a 25-18 record, which had them in fourth place in the Eastern Conference, and they boast arguably the NBA's best fast-break attack. It looked like the Lakers were in for another stiff test and possibly their 13th loss in 22 games.\n\nThey found themselves behind 30-21 at the end of the first quarter because of the lackluster defense that has become a habit for them over the last several weeks. But they responded with 11 unanswered points and a 24-6 overall run to start the second quarter. After most of the second and third quarters were close, L.A. went on an 11-3 run to end the third period, and after that, it opened things up en route to a 110-93 victory.\n\nToronto's 93 points were a season low for it, and it shot only 41.8% from the field and 21.9% from 3-point range. Los Angeles started to employ a zone defense in the second quarter that helped turn the tide, and it also outrebounded the Raptors by five and held them to 14 fast-break points. With a 25-16 record, L.A. remains in sixth place in the Western Conference and has a half-game cushion over the seventh-place Phoenix Suns.\n\nSmart helped hold Raptors starting point guard Immanuel Quickley, who came into this game averaging 16.5 points a game, to nine points on 4-of-9 field-goal shooting. Offensively, he made half of his six shot attempts and two of his three 3-point attempts, and he finished with eight points, five rebounds, three assists and one steal, but he committed five turnovers in 25 minutes.\n\nFor the second straight game, LaRavia contributed next to nothing offensively. He made one of his five shot attempts and ended up with two points, to go along with five rebounds, two assists and one steal in 19 minutes.\n\nAyton got the ball fairly often in the first half, allowing him to log 12 points by halftime. The Lakers continued to feed him the ball in prime scoring position throughout the game, and he took full advantage by making all 10 of his shot attempts and five of his six free throw attempts, giving him 25 points. He also grabbed 13 rebounds and added one assist and one block in 33 minutes.\n\nDoncic scored 18 points in the first half, but he was just 5-of-14 from the field during that time, and he had three of his shots blocked by Raptors forward Collin Murray-Boyles. He shot even more poorly in the second half and ended up 8-of-23 overall from the field, although he did go 5-of-12 from 3-point land.\n\nDoncic finished this game with 25 points, seven assists, two rebounds, one steal and one block in 34 minutes.\n\nJames played 32 minutes and shot 9-of-17 from the floor, allowing him to finish with 24 points, seven assists, four rebounds and two blocks. When the Lakers went on that 24-6 run early in the second quarter, he scored nine points to ignite that spurt.\n\nIn 17 minutes, Vincent hit two of his five shot attempts and finished with five points, two assists, one rebound and one steal.\n\nAfter missing three straight games with a hamstring ailment, Hayes played 13 minutes and had two points and five rebounds to help L.A.'s cause.\n\nHachimura may not be fully back in game shape and rhythm after missing seven straight games with a calf injury. But he made a decent contribution on Sunday with 10 points on 4-of-10 shooting in 21 minutes off the bench. However, he didn't have a single rebound, assist, steal or block.\n\nVanderbilt was very active in this contest, and it resulted in him putting up good numbers across the board. In 21 minutes, he grabbed nine rebounds and added two points, one assist, two steals and two blocks. He was a significant factor when the Lakers established a sizable lead late in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter, especially defensively and on the boards.\n\nOne night after scoring 21 points on 9-of-12 shooting, Timme got 16 minutes and went 1-of-4 overall and 1-of-2 from downtown. He finished with three points, three rebounds and two assists.\n\nAll four players were on the court for the final 2:17 of this game. Knecht, the younger James and Bufkin went scoreless and didn't attempt a single shot, while Smith made one of his three shot attempts and had three points.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers player grades: L.A. wins going away against Raptors",

    "fullText": "The NFC Championship Game is set, and it will feature a familiar matchup as the Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams meet for the third time this season, with Seattle opening as the favorite.\n\nOddsmakers at BetOnline.ag have installed the Seahawks as 2.5-point favorites over the Rams in the NFC title game, with the over/under set at 47 points. The opening line reflects a shift from the lookahead number, which had Seattle favored by just one point before the weekend’s playoff results.\n\nThe matchup marks the third meeting between the NFC West rivals this season, with each team winning once at home. The Rams took the first meeting by two points at SoFi Stadium, while the Seahawks answered with a dramatic, comeback one-point overtime victory in Seattle, setting the stage for a tightly contested rubber match with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line.\n\nSeattle’s status as the favorite is also reflected in the updated Super Bowl LX futures. The Seahawks are currently listed as the overall favorites at 3/2 (+150), ahead of the Rams, who sit at 11/5 (+220). The New England Patriots are third at 11/4 (+275), followed by the Denver Broncos at 11/1.\n\nThe Rams’ shorter odds compared to most remaining teams underscore how narrow the gap is perceived to be between the NFC finalists, despite Seattle being favored at home. The Seahawks’ defense and home-field advantage have played a significant role in the early betting action, while the Rams’ ability to keep both regular-season meetings close has kept expectations of another tight game high.\n\nIn the AFC, the betting landscape has also shifted. With Broncos quarterback Bo Nix out with an injury, the AFC Championship Game line has moved significantly, reopening at New England -4 before climbing to Patriots -6.\n\nDespite four teams being eliminated over the weekend, Denver’s Super Bowl odds have lengthened from 8/1 to 11/1, reflecting increased uncertainty around their path to a title without Nix.\n\nFor now, the focus remains on the NFC, where the Seahawks and Rams will meet once more, this time with the conference crown and a Super Bowl berth at stake.",

    "fullText": "Matthew Stafford has spent most of the 2025 season making quarterback play look effortless, but Sunday’s divisional playoff game against the Chicago Bears was a rare quiet afternoon by his standards. The veteran passer failed to throw a touchdown for the first time all year, completing just 20 of 42 attempts for 258 yards in the Rams’ gritty 20–17 overtime victory.\n\nEven in a win that sent Los Angeles to the NFC Championship, Stafford was his own harshest critic. Despite the celebration around him, Stafford didn’t hide from his uneven performance. Speaking after the game, he admitted he never found his usual rhythm.\n\n“No, I definitely didn’t get into a great rhythm today, there’s no question about that,” Stafford said post-game. “Had some opportunities in the pass game, just some things that made it tough. Obviously, I can be better.”\n\nThe Bears’ remarkable season came to a heartbreaking end at SoFi Stadium. Chicago had captured the NFC North, knocked off the Packers in the wild-card round, and taken organizational steps that hadn’t been seen in decades. They nearly added another chapter to that story, rallying in the final minute when Caleb Williams found Cole Kmet on a stunning fourth-down strike to tie the game with 17 seconds left.\n\nOvertime, however, belonged to the Rams. Williams threw a costly interception on a potential game-winning drive, and Los Angeles methodically moved into range for Harrison Mevis, who drilled a 42-yard field goal to seal the victory. The Rams now advance to face the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship, while Chicago is left watching two teams sitting exactly where it hopes to be next season. So, despite the sub-par stat line, Stafford isn’t all that regretful.\n\n“But playoff football is about winning the football game. I played great, threw for a bunch of yards last year in the snow and we lost, and that sucks. I’m happy to have played a little bit worse today and go home with a win. We’ll take that.”\n\nHis stat line backed up the self-assessment: a 47.6 percent completion rate, no touchdowns, no interceptions, and a 67.4 passer rating. It was far from the form that had defined his regular season.\n\nOne off night doesn’t erase what has been a historic campaign. It wouldn’t be a stretch to call this the best season of Stafford’s 17-year career. The 37-year-old averaged 276.9 passing yards per game and eclipsed 4,600 yards for the fifth time, highlighted by a 457-yard explosion against Seattle in Week 16.\n\nHe finished the regular season with more than 45 touchdown passes, leading the league by a wide margin —Jared Goff’s 34 was the next closest total — while throwing just eight interceptions despite consistently pushing the ball downfield. Those numbers kept him firmly in the MVP conversation even as the Rams split their final six games.\n\nSunday’s matchup showed a different version of the Rams offense. Los Angeles leaned heavily on the pass early, asking Stafford to drop back 40 times in regulation while running just seven times in the first half. The ground game found more life after the break, but the contest remained tight thanks to Chicago’s balanced attack of 160 rushing yards on 39 attempts.\n\nIn the end, style points didn’t matter. The Rams capitalized when it counted, and Stafford, despite his first touchdown-less outing, did enough to move his team one step closer to the Super Bowl.\n\nThe post “I Can Be Better”: Matthew Stafford Gets Honest About 0-TD Game vs. Bears Despite 45+ TDs This Season appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills’ 2025-2026 NFL season ended in heartbreak, and quarterback Josh Allen did not hide the toll it took on him. Following the Bills’ playoff loss to the Denver Broncos, Allen cried while addressing reporters, apologizing to his teammates and expressing disappointment over how the season concluded.\n\nThe Bills’ campaign came to an end on January 17, after a defeat to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Divisional Round. Speaking at the post-game press conference, Josh Allen struggled to hold back tears as he addressed the result and his mindset following the loss. “It’s extremely difficult,” Allen said. He continued, “I feel like I let my teammates down tonight.”\n\nWhen asked why the defeat affected him so profoundly, Allen explained that the game featured several moments the team failed to capitalize on. He said there were “missed opportunities throughout the game,” before adding, “It’s been a long season. I hate how it ended, and that’s gonna stick with me for a long time.”\n\nJosh Allen also addressed what he told his teammates in the immediate aftermath of the loss, making it clear that emotions were still raw in the locker room. “I haven’t been doing a lot of talking,” Allen admitted. “I love my teammates, and I’m extremely sorry, and I’m extremely disappointed in how this ended,” he continued. The game itself ended in overtime, when Will Lutz converted a 24-yard field goal to secure the win for the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe press conference also came at a meaningful time in Allen’s personal life, as his wife, Hailee Steinfeld, is currently pregnant and expecting the couple’s first child.\n\nWith the victory, Denver advanced to the AFC Championship Game, where the top-seeded team will face either the New England Patriots or the Houston Texans on January 25. The opponent will be determined following the Patriots-Texans matchup on January 18.\n\nThe post Bills’ Josh Allen Cries After Loss: ‘I Let My Teammates Down’ appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO (AP) — Caleb Williams' last throw in regulation was a backpedaling, fourth-down rainbow that landed in Cole Kmet's hands in the corner of the end zone for a breathtaking touchdown.\n\nHis last throw of the game was the beginning of the end for Chicago's surprising season.\n\nWilliams almost rallied the Bears to another memorable win on Sunday night. But he threw his third interception in overtime and Matthew Stafford drove the Los Angeles Rams to Harrison Mevis' winning field goal in a 20-17 victory in the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\n“It's tough. In these moments, you feel that you let your team down,” Williams said. “You feel this or that. It’s a good lesson learned for us, first time being in this situation for me and for us as a team. I’m excited for what’s to come. But obviously going to go back and watch this and figure out how I can be better, and that’s the exciting part.”\n\nThe 24-year-old Williams led Chicago to an NFL-record seven wins this season when trailing in last 2 minutes of regulation. He threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to DJ Moore with 1:43 left in a 31-27 victory over Green Bay in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThis time, the Bears (12-7) were losing 17-10 when they got the ball back with 1:50 left in the fourth quarter. And, just like before, Williams delivered.\n\nFacing a fourth-and-4 at the Rams 14 with 27 seconds left, Williams took a shotgun snap and surveyed the field. The No. 1 pick in the 2024 draft was forced to backpedal as the pocket collapsed, and he scampered all the way back to the 40 with Jared Verse, Josaiah Stewart and Braden Fiske all in pursuit for the Rams.\n\nWilliams turned, saw Kmet in the end zone and threw the ball in his direction just as Verse and Stewart got to the second-year QB.\n\n“I ended up getting a little bit of pressure, so try and break contain and just break angles and slow those guys down so that when I do turn around, I can have a little bit more time possibly to find somebody,” Williams said, “and they did a good job containing me, so I just gained a little bit more depth, and I saw Cole one-on-one over there.”\n\nKmet wrestled with Rams cornerback Cobie Turner before hauling in the pass, sending a charge through the crowd of 60,253 on a frigid night at Soldier Field.\n\n“It felt like a pretty easy pitch-and-catch and kind of felt like it was in slow motion,” Kmet said. “I can’t believe Caleb.”\n\nBears coach Ben Johnson called the throw “ridiculous.”\n\n“There’s some things that you just can’t coach. ... He’s got a knack, he’s clutch,” Johnson said.\n\nAccording to Next Gen Stats, Williams' pass traveled 51.2 yards in the air for the longest completed pass by air distance in the red zone since at least 2016. He made the throw from 26.5 yards behind the line of scrimmage; no quarterback since 2016, according to Next Gen Stats, had completed a pass from a depth of more than 22 yards.\n\nIt had a completion probability of 17.8%.\n\n“It was the most special throw that I’ve ever seen. I’ve seen him do that so many times this year,” Bears safety Kevin Byard said.\n\nWilliams also threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Moore on fourth down on the first play of the second quarter. But his three interceptions were costly.\n\nThe Bears had a chance to win the game in overtime. They drove to the Los Angeles 48 before Williams was picked off by Rams safety Kam Curl on a deep ball intended for Moore.\n\n“Just a miscommunication between him and I,” Williams said. \"Tried to flatten him off under the safety, and he kept it vertical from what I saw, obviously, in the moment.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New England Patriots are heading to the AFC Championship Game after taking care of the Houston Texans on Sunday.\n\nThe team will take on the Denver Broncos, who recently found out that starting quarterback Bo Nix will miss the rest of the postseason with a broken ankle. The Broncos were able to beat the Buffalo Bills anyway, but it'll be tough to move forward without their quarterback.\n\nHowever, not everybody is penciling the Patriots into the Super Bowl.\n\nFormer NFL quarterback Nick Foles was watching the game and wanted to remind everybody about something. Foles mentioned that the Patriots \"struggle against backup QBs\" in championship-style games.\n\n\"Note for the Broncos and their fans: I know it has been an emotional 24 hours. I feel for Bo and the team, and I'm sending prayers for a strong recovery,\" Foles said. \"A positive note going into the game versus the Patriots is that they struggle against backup QBs in championship-type games.\"\n\nOf course, Foles is referring to Super Bowl LII, where he stepped in as the backup quarterback and led the Philadelphia Eagles to a win over the Patriots.\n\nIn that game, Foles played like a star, throwing for 373 yards and three touchdowns. The famous \"Philly Special\" play was born that night, and the Patriots received plenty of grief for losing to a backup quarterback.\n\nFoles went on to play one more season with the Eagles after that Super Bowl before signing a massive free agent contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2019.\n\nIt was a hilarious note from Foles, but the situations aren't exactly the same.\n\nFoles was the backup, but he had already been a Pro Bowler once in his career. The quarterback was a reliable veteran passer and one of the best backups in the league.\n\nThe Broncos, though, have to rely on Jarrett Stidham. Stidham has just over 1,400 yards and eight touchdown passes in his career and has never played in a playoff game.\n\nInterestingly, Stidham did spend two seasons with the Patriots, and now he has a chance to prove himself against one of his former teams.\n\nPatrick Mahomes comments on offensive coordinator Matt Nagy\n\nSteelers urged to replace Aaron Rodgers with SEC star\n\nSteelers could find new coach in a familiar place\n\nCould Steelers trade for former first-round pick?\n\nStephen A.

    "description": "Senegal walked off the pitch in protest to a contentious late penalty decision against them, before Brahim Diaz stunningly missed his spot-kick with an inexplicable ‘Panenka’ effort",
    "fullText": "Senegal have been crowned Africa Cup of Nations champions after one of the most chaotic and perplexing conclusions to a major final in football history.\n\nAfter what had been a frantic but goalless game so far, the clash descended into carnage in second-half stoppage time after two controversial decisions against Senegal, the second being a last-gasp penalty for Morocco, led to manager Pape Thiaw dragging his team off the pitch and into the dressing room in protest.\n\nTeranga Lions talisman Sadio Mane remained on the touchline before retrieving his team after a lengthy delay, with referee Jean-Jacques Ndala losing complete control of the match.\n\nBrahim Diaz, who went down softly to win the spot-kick, then stepped up to take the penalty in the 24th minute of additional time, only to see his abysmal ‘Panenka’ attempt float into the arms of Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy, with the game therefore forced into extra time.\n\nPape Sarr went on to score the winner in stunning fashion for Senegal in the 94th minute, with his rocket of an effort proving the difference and denying the Atlas Lions a first Afcon title since 1976.\n\nSenegal thought they had snatched victory at the death when Ismaila Sarr bundled the ball home in the second minute of stoppage time, heading home after Abdoulaye Seck saw his effort ricochet off the post. However, the whistle went very quickly for a soft foul on Achraf Hakimi, who had been brushed off by Seck as the Paris Saint-Germain star tried to hinder the defender.\n\nThiaw and the Senegal players were clearly outraged by Ndala’s decision, which did not appear to receive much of a VAR check. The game swiftly got back underway with the score still goalless.\n\nThree minutes later, Diaz went down in the box under the challenge of left-back El Hadji Malick Diouf, claiming he had been tugged to the ground by the West Ham man. With Diaz vehemently protesting that he had been fouled, the incident was taken to VAR before Ndala was called to the monitor.\n\nOfficials and players jostled with each other while the referee consulted the touchline screen and when Ndala returned to the pitch to award a last-minute spot-kick, giving Morocco a golden chance to snatch Afcon glory, the final plunged into chaos.\n\nThiaw ordered his players off the pitch in protest to what was another soft decision against his Senegal side, initially keeping them on the touchline before dragging them into the dressing room. A handful of Morocco players remained in the box, waiting to take their potentially match-winning penalty as they consulted the referee.\n\nIn the midst of the mayhem, Senegal fans clashed with security as they tried to invade the pitch, with some seen being forcibly carried away. Senegal talisman Mane, however, stayed on the pitch in an act of defiance against his manager’s orders, with the former Liverpool winger clearly keen to get the match restarted. Yet with the Senegal team nowhere to be seen, the outcome of the final hung in the balance.\n\nMane ran into the dressing room to retrieve his players and after a 16-minute hiatus, the Senegal squad returned to the Stade Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium turf to allow Morocco to take their penalty. In what he says was his last ever Afcon match, Mane was evidently instrumental on getting his teammates back on the pitch, with Thiaw eventually giving in and similarly instructing his players to return.\n\nDiaz, the tournament’s top scorer with five goals, stepped up to the plate in the 24th minute of stoppage time, with further delays coming about as goalkeeper Mendy persistently came off his line to speak to the Real Madrid midfielder, perhaps in a bid to put him off.\n\nWhen Diaz eventually took the spot-kick, he inexplicably tried a ‘Panenka’-style chip and has weak penalty sailed tamely into the arms of Mendy, passing up on the opportunity to deliver Morocco a first Afcon title in 50 years. The reaction of the Senegal players - hardly celebrating before turning and running up the other end - raised the eyebrows of viewers.\n\nDiaz was later shown in tears after the match and was completely dejected as he received his golden boot award from Fifa president Gianni Infantino.\n\nWith Diaz’s miss forcing the game to extra time, Thiaw's men, fuelled by a sense of injustice, regrouped and forced their way in front when Gueye surged forward and blasted a left-foot piledriver past Morocco goalkeeper Bono and in off the underside of the crossbar.\n\nBono later denied Cherif Ndiaye a second with a stunning double save and Gueye's contribution ultimately proved decisive.",

    "fullText": "Erling Haaland put in a tired and poor performance for Manchester City in their 2-nil loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford. Manchester City’s top scorer has carried a heavy workload up front in the absence of Omar Marmoush due to international duty, and the injuries suffered by Savinho and Oscar Bobb haven’t helped matters. Haaland is trying hard, but he does seem to need a rest. Omar Marmoush is set to return from international duty with Egypt. With the African Cup of Nations now complete, Marmoush is set to rejoin the City squad. Help is on the way for Manchester City’s attack, but Marmoush may not be available for City’s next match against Bodø/Glimt in the Champions League.\n\nThe return of Omar Marmoush will give Pep Guardiola another option to use up front. Erling Haaland needs a rest, and Omar Marmoush is the player to give him the rest that he needs. With AFCON now complete, Marmoush is set to link up with the Manchester City squad. The hope is that Marmoush will be available for Manchester City’s Champions League league phase fixture against Bodø/Glimt in Norway on Tuesday night. But Pep Guardiola is unsure if Marmoush will be ready to feature at the Aspmyra Stadion.\n\nSpeaking after his team’s derby defeat to Manchester United, Pep Guardiola was asked if Omar Marmoush would be available for Manchester City’s next match against Bodø/Glimt. Guardiola said he didn’t think Marmoush would play in Norway. When asked about Omar Marmoush’s availability, he told the media: “No I don’t think so.”\n\nAlthough Omar Marmoush hasn’t offered much for Manchester City so far this season, they do need the Egyptian international back and firing. So far this season, Marmoush has scored one goal and added one assist in 15 appearances in all competitions. Marmoush has mainly featured as a substitute this season, coming on in the closing stages of matches. He also suffered a knee injury earlier this season, which was a major setback for him.\n\nOmar Marmoush is too good to be a substitute. When fully fit and in form, he offers a completely different threat than Erling Haaland. Marmoush’s movement and intelligent runs in the final third make him a dangerous player. He also has the ability to produce spectacular long-range shots, so Pep Guardiola’s side needs Marmoush back. Hopefully, he has rediscovered his touch and form while playing for Egypt at the African Cup of Nations.\n\nManchester City are about to get a boost with the return of Omar Marmoush. He may not feature in City’s upcoming Champions League fixture against Bodø/Glimt, but he is almost back and ready to contribute for Pep Guardiola’s side, and that is welcome news for City given what lies ahead this season.",

    "description": "Here's how the teams in the AFC and NFC title games stack up against each other.",
    "fullText": "NFL power rankings: Three reasons Seahawks, Patriots, Rams and Broncos will (and won't) win Super Bowl 60 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWho will win Super Bowl 60? The wide-open 2025-2026 NFL playoffs started with a combined 14 teams from the AFC and NFC, but it's down to four with the conference championship matchups now set for next Sunday.\n\nThe AFC has held form, with the No. 1 seed Denver Broncos (14-3) ready to host the No. 2 seed New England Patriots (14-3). The best team in the NFC, the No. 1 seed Seattle Seahawks (14-3) will host the No. 5 Los Angeles Rams (12-5) in another NFC West rubber match.\n\nAny one of those teams can either win the Super Bowl or fall flat in the league semifinals. Based on each team's odds to finish the playoffs undefeated and raise the Lombardi Trophy, here's looking at why the Seahawks, Patriots, Rams and Broncos will succeed or fail through the last two rounds:\n\n(Futures odds courtesy of Caesars Sportsbook)\n\nThe Seahawks led the NFL scoring defense (16.6 points allowed per game) and were third in total defense (282.8 yards per game) during the regular season. They were No. 2 against the run (92.6 yards per game) and No. 9 against the pass (190.3). They lived up to that reputation and then some in obliterating the 49ers in the divisional round of the playoffs, 41-6.\n\nMORE: How Seahawks smacked 49ers behind dominant defense\n\nThey are in sync with the pressure and coverage and just erased San Francisco's running game. Outside of some issues covering backs and tight ends, Seattle has no defensive weaknesses. They are starting to channel much of the classic \"Legion of Boom\" energy from their Super Bowl 48-winning team.\n\nThe Seahawks ran the ball on 50.6 percent of their offensive plays, No. 2 in the NFL behind only the Ravens. They were No. 7 in rushing yards per game, averaging 126.2 yards. With a blowout in the divisional round, Seattle rushed the ball at a 63.5 percent clip, producing 175 yards on 33 attempts, with Kenneth Walker III (116 yards, 3 TDs) carrying the load after Zach Charbonnet (knee) got hurt.\n\nWhen Seattle can run the ball at a high clip, it takes a lot of pressure off Sam Darnold in the passing game. With their offensive line getting great interior blocking, it's a tough rushing attack to stop.\n\nThe Seahawks' run blocking has been on point and Klint Kubiak has done well to keep the offense balanced so it maintains explosiveness, too.\n\nSam Darnold has responded in his reunion with Kubiak, playing well off the running game. It's wise to trust elite breakout wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba to make the big plays needed all the way through the end zone. Darnold has also hit on well-timed deep shots to other wideouts and made good use of his tight ends when called upon. Darnold has been fortunate to land in another QB-friendly system after his big season with Minnesota.\n\n1. Too little from the passing game\n\nDarnold is falling into the Trent Dilfer-Brad Johnson category of potential Super Bowl quarterbacks. He is more of a complementary strong supporter on a team led by defense and the running game. However, Darnold should be prepared to try to win another shootout in Seattle with Matthew Stafford after not needing to much to beat the 49ers.\n\nFor such a dominant team, the Seahawks were minus-3 in turnover margin during the regular season. They were second in the NFL with their 28 giveaways and Darnold threw 14 of Seattle's 15 interceptions. Although they crushed the 49ers in the turnover battle, 3-0, to reverse that trend, the Rams will be out looking for mistakes from Darnold.\n\nThe Seahawks were a middle of the pack offense on third down this season, converting on 39.8 percent of third-down chances. Seattle's third down struggles were highlighted in the divisional round, going 4-for-10 (40 percent) in the playoff rout of the 49ers. The Seahawks will need do better at sustaining drives or meet a playoff exit.\n\nThe Patriots' secondary was active and a big reason why they thwarted the Texans' makeshift receiving corps. C.J. Stroud saw some pressure, but his bad passes cost him because New England was opportunistic. New England also was all over ripping into Justin Herbert and his receivers in the wild-card round. The defense, not the offense, is why the Patriots remain alive, one game away from the Super Bowl.\n\nMaye got out of some his early playoff jitters and kinks against the Texans and Chargers, facing a lot more pressure in two senses and being less accurate and careful with the ball. But after a hot finish vs. Houston's brutal all-around defensive test with little help from the traditional running game, Maye should have a lot more confidence he can do what Josh Allen did in Denver to the Broncos' defense, only minus the turnovers.\n\nMORE: Why Patriots won't get away with sloppy Drake Maye vs. Bo Nix-less Broncos\n\nMike Vrabel and Josh McDaniels have proved to be strong Belichickian proxies for New England with Maye and the young defensive talent making their jobs much easier to execute at a high level. Vrabel has wasted no time returning to the ranks off top NFL coaches, picking up where left off with lesser teams in Tennessee.\n\nMaye has gotten sloppy with his ball security when running or keeping pass plays alive in the pocket. He has also thrown an interception in each of his first two playoff games, and luckily hasn't been picked off more with some anomalous inaccuracy. The Patriots must win the turnover battle all-around to win the war.\n\nMORE: Texans can't take advantage of Drake Maye's turnover troubles\n\nMaye is in Year 2. Everyone's adjusting to the Vrabel-McDaniels era after one bad transitional year with Jerod Mayo. There is some youth serving well on the defense despite its green nature. The Patriots are a facing a tight-nit Broncos' defense and would get either the swarming Seahawks or the savvier Sean McVay-led Rams in the Super Bowl.\n\nThe Patriots tend to give up touchdowns deep when their opponents can sustain long drives. They made the Texans look better in this major area of struggle on Sunday. Not holding for field goals on a couple drives can make the biggest difference for Maye and the offense moving forward.\n\nMcVay is the best coach in the NFL, considering his offensive play-calling acumen, motivational skills and situational understanding. He took advantage of a flawed field to push the team toward its first championship under him in Super Bowl 56. His offensive staff and defensive coordinator Chris Shula crush it every week, too.\n\nMORE: Why Sean McVay-Ben Johnson postgame handshake was cordial\n\n2. Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua and Davante Adams\n\nStafford might have more chemistry with Nacua and Adams than he did with Cooper Kupp and his other receivers four years ago. Nacua is off to a historic start with his production and Adams' red zone dominance has further stamped his Hall of Fame career. Stafford has been on point getting them the ball and it's also opened up big plays downfield and after the catch for the tight ends and other receivers.\n\n3. A strong defensive front seven\n\nThe back end of the Rams' defense has had some coverage breakdowns at corner and safety, exploitable in several matchups. The Rams won their last Super Bowl with Aaron Donald as the linchpin and Jalen Ramsey as the mercenary. Now they've a rebuilt a stout disruptive corps with Jared Verse, Kobie Turner, Braden Fiske, Nate Landman and other active youngsters.\n\n1. Not running the ball enough or effectively\n\nThe Rams have a good rushing attack, especially in short yardage and in the red zone. They stuck with the run 31 times against the Bears, with Kyren Williams scoring both of their TDs. But they averaged only 3.6 yards a carry and couldn't put the game away with the rushing attack in the fourth quarter. They can't get afford to get stuck being too one-dimensional for Stafford's sake.\n\nThe Rams made some huge interceptions against Caleb Williams to help survive in the divisional round. But they also had some major coverage breakdowns and benefitted from a few just-missed connections and drops by the Bears receivers.\n\nMcVay tends to be old-school for still being a young hotshot calling the offensive shots at age 39. For example, he could have trusted Stafford and the passing game to run out the clock with one more first down in regulation, but invited the Bears back in with a late short punt. Some tougher fourth-down calls might be required to outlast the Seahawks plus either the Patriots or Broncos.\n\nSean Payton and defensive coordinator Vance Joseph have been on point, coaching complementary football. Payton has the experience of winning Super Bowl 44 while leading the Saints and will extract the most out of his now more injury-riddled roster one last time. That includes scheming to make backup Jarrett Stidham semi-successful filling in for Bo Nix.\n\nThe Broncos dodged a bullet with cornerback Patrick Surtain returning vs. the Bills. They also saw more playmakers come though in the secondary behind good pressure on Allen, led by Ja'Quan McMillan in the slot corner role. Nik Bonitto and others set Denver up for success against the Bills and should be ready to tee off against Drake Maye and the Patriots.\n\nWith Nix out for the season with a broken bone in his ankle, his early legacy of being a clutch late-game quarterback may rub off with the whole team. Expect Denver to rally around Stidham to come through in the end.\n\n1. No Bo Nix and more offensive injuries\n\nStidham will likely need to go to work minus wide receivers Pat Bryant and Troy Franklin, just as the young targets were starting to come through for Nix. Now Stidham is dealing with a short-handed receiving corps on top of being rusty and jittery playing against his first NFL team at home.\n\nMORE:Why Nick Foles thinks Broncos have a chance after Bo Nix injury\n\nThe Broncos didn't find a reliable rushing attack even against the Bills' porous run defense, with Nix's scrambling leading the way in the running game. The team misses the power and juice of JK Dobbins with rookie RJ Harvey providing only some flashes without power-running substance. If the Broncos can't take pressure off Stidham with the running game vs. a nasty Patriots run defense, Stidham should be prepared to see a lot of heat in his face.\n\nSurtain and McMillan saved the day in many ways against the Bills, but the Broncos are not known for making big plays on the ball with only 10 interceptions and four fumble recoveries from the regular season. They need to be sound fundamentally for Vance Joseph and win the situational battles on third down and in the red zone. Any little crack in coverage and Maye will exploit it for chunk passes downfield with his fearless, big arm.",

    "fullText": "The Southwest Ohio Classic is a Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend tradition in Cincinnati. It's billed as the largest high school swimming meet of its kind in the country and has produced some of the greatest swimming moments in this city's history.\n\nThe 2026 edition was no different. Over two days at 11 different sites, swimmers and divers worked to continue their impressive seasons while also using the weekend as a tune-up for the fast-approaching postseason.\n\nHere are five of the biggest storylines from this year's meet. Complete results can be found here.\n\nThe Kings senior and Georgia signee recorded one of the greatest performances in meet history, breaking four meet records, two of which she set last year.\n\nShe won the 100-yard backstroke and 100-yard butterfly in back-to-back fashion on Saturday, but had a little more time in between her 200-yard individual medley and 200-yard backstroke victories on Sunday.\n\n\"I was just thinking about my training and what I've been training for, and trying to keep my technique and strategy together and do what I've been practicing. I think that I executed that really well,\" Schweikert said.\n\nShe is the two-time defending Division I 100-yard backstroke state champion and won the 100-yard butterfly in 2025 but may switch up her postseason regimen this time around. She called the individual medley a mental challenge but is starting to like that event.\n\n\"Honestly, I do better with no expectation. It's kind of just getting in and swimming. So keeping that up and not having the expectations, just practicing what I've been practicing. You have no idea what you're capable of until you do it,\" Schweikert said.\n\nAdditional multi-event winners include St. Xavier's Chase Grisi, Mason's Bella Teply and Dana Fairbanks, Roger Bacon's Reese Reilly, Milford's Brady Campbell, Elder's Reese Morgan and Springfield Shawnee's Madi Lee. All except Campbell, Morgan and Lee are seniors, showcasing just how deep this year's senior class is. Expect to see the majority of those names atop the podium in Canton in the last weekend of February.\n\n\"We have a lot of great athletes in our senior class this year and it's always exciting to see everybody swim fast and show what Cincinnati can do as a whole,\" Reilly said.\n\nThe Roger Bacon senior and Duke signee is the two-time defending DII 100-yard breaststroke winner and set a school record in the 100-yard butterfly this season. She missed the meet record by one-tenth of a second but won her second event of the weekend after claiming the 200-yard breaststroke on Saturday.\n\n\"Just a few things that I could clean up, like my walls. But overall, I think it was a good swim and that the rest of the season has a lot of potential, too,\" Reilly said.\n\nThe race for the girls team title was tight at the top as Mason won with 445 points, St. Ursula recorded its third runner-up finish in four years with 414 points and Ursuline came in third with 400 points.\n\n\"We want to continue the momentum moving into the end of the season, but it's so hard to tell what the future holds. We see two of the best teams right here, right now, so it's a really good gauge to see what what we're getting into and what we have to play with,\" head coach Grace Seibert said.\n\nThe Lions also took third place at the 2025 DI state meet with 169 points, just 26 behind Mason. It was their best finish since they claimed back-to-back titles in 2013 and 2014. They were bolstered by now-seniors Melia Eckman, Alyssa Uhlman and Grier Gordon, and junior Norah Smyth winning the 400-yard freestyle relay but have several key contributors making their way through the ranks.\n\nWhile Eckman won the 50-yard freestyle, freshman Kaia Pohlmeyer took second place in the 50-yard breaststroke. Junior Maisie Moran is also a promising backstroke and individual medley swimmer.\n\n\"Even though we have a lot of seniors, I think we have a lot of depth that can help carry us through,\" Seibert said.\n\nCampbell became Milford's first swimming state champion when he claimed the 2025 DI 50-yard freestyle. He also swam on the 200- and 400-yard freestyle relays that placed third, the highest relay finishes in school history.\n\nAt the 2026 Southwest Ohio Classic, he won the 50- and 100-yard freestyles, the 100-yard breaststroke and the 100-yard butterfly. The breaststroke is his newest stroke but as one of the top swimmers in the state, he caught on to it naturally.\n\n\"I kind of just got into it last year at our conference meet. I found out I have a passion or a liking for it and ever since, I've just been working on it in practice,\" Campbell said.\n\nStill just a junior, he said one of his events in the postseason will definitely be the butterfly, where he was the 2025 state runner-up. In the next few weeks, he will explore his options for which freestyle distance he will contest.\n\n\"This season's been great for me. I've opened a bunch of doors for those different distances. For the freestyle, it's still kind of up in the air. The 50, 100 and 200, they all have great competition and I've just been getting better at all three,\" Campbell said.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of the girls program, the Comets boys team showed over the weekend that it should contend for a second straight top five placement at the state meet.\n\nMason actually led St. Xavier in the team standings heading into the final event, but a Bomber win in the 400-yard freestyle relay saw them keep their Southwest Classic undefeated streak alive. The margin between St. Xavier and Mason was one of the closest in meet history, with the Bombers winning with 703 points to Mason's 696.5.\n\n\"We've been super excited ever since state last year. We've had a goal, since a lot of us are seniors and juniors, to make this year as special as possible,\" Mason senior Aidan Jansen said.\n\nLast year's state team consisted of five juniors (Jansen, Ethan Tu, Robert Wall, Liam Clark, Yassin Ghobril) and five sophomores (Mulenga Cole, Noah Kirk, Samyak Ramchandre, Max Vazquez, Austin Zhong). All made valuable contributions over the weekend. Even sophomore Jake Xu, who swam in the 500-yard freestyle prelims as a freshman, has improved. He won the Southwest Classic 1,650-yard freestyle in 16:11.42, overtaking St. X's Alex Nixon midway through the race.\n\n\"We've got a lot of events with a lot of guys that are really good, and even with the four person limit on the lineup, it's gonna be hard because we've got so many people who are so good,\" Jansen said.\n\nThe two finals sessions saw some of the fastest times in meet history as seven meet records were broken in Saturday night's finals session and two more fell on Sunday night, including the oldest record in meet history.\n\nGirls 200-yard freestyle: Michelle Dean, Bellbrook, 1:47.57 (previously set by Finneytown's Buffy Kreiger with a time of 1:48.64 in 1985)\n\nBoys 200-yard freestyle: Chase Grisi, St. Xavier, 1:36.39 (Jason Zhao, Indian Hill, 1:37.41, 2025)\n\nBoys 50-yard freestyle: Brady Campbell, Milford, 20.06 seconds (Aaron Sequira, Walnut Hills, 20.18 seconds, 2020)\n\nGirls 500-yard freestyle: Bella Teply, Mason, 4:51.01 (Amanda Smith, Indian Hill, 2007, and Zoe Thatcher, Mason, 2013, 4:53.1)\n\nBoys 200-yard freestyle relay: St. Xavier, 1:21.47 (St. Xavier, 1:22.42, 2017)\n\nGirls 100-yard backstroke: Maya Schweikert, Kings, 53.23 seconds (Schweikert, 53.28 seconds, 2025)\n\nGirls 100-yard butterfly: Maya Schweikert, Kings, 53.51 seconds (Ella Jo Piersma, Seven Hills, 55.1 seconds, 2022)\n\nGirls 200-yard individual medley: Maya Schweikert, Kings, 2:00.41 (Jenny Forster, Centerville, 2:01.15, 2005)\n\nGirls 200-yard backstroke: Maya Schweikert, Kings, 1:55.33 (Schweikert, 1:56.93, 2025)\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Records fall, postseason prep begins at 2026 Southwest Ohio Classic",

    "description": "Seven years ago we traveled to Scunthorpe United under Jack Ross - can you guess the score?!",
    "fullText": "Jack Ross really wasn’t that far away, but if I ask you to guess the score from a game in his first season as manager, you can probably guess. Even seven years down the line, that scoreline is etched on our brains when it comes to thinking about the 2018-19 season.\n\nConsidering the circumstances that he took the job, it was a good season on paper. Ross came from Scotland to take on what was probably one of the hardest jobs in football at that time, and he took to the training pitch on his first day without the relevant number of players to put out a matchday squad.\n\nIt was vital that we got off to a good start against Charlton Athletic on the opening day, and it seemed like it would only end in promotion, considering we’d lost only two games before the turn of the year. For the conversation to come, around a quarter of those league games before New Year’s Day ended 1-1.\n\n2019 began with a 1-0 win at Blackpool, but then the next two games ended in a 1-1 draw. On this day eight years ago, we travelled to Scunthorpe United, which puts our current position into perspective.\n\nStuart McCall had recently taken charge at Scunthorpe and had won the previous four successive games, so it was never going to be easy, but Sunderland were clearly off the pace from the off. Jon McLaughlin was required to save the lads on several occasions to stop the home side from taking the lead.\n\nRoss’ side was comfortable in possession, but it rarely went anywhere and chances were at a premium as it went into the break goalless. Around the hour mark, Josh Maja did his thing. It came from good work by Reece James, who supplied Maja to glance the ball home.\n\nInstead of taking the game to the hosts and putting the game to bed, we aimed to frustrate them, which meant they stayed in the game. As it got closer to the final whistle, both sides became more desperate, but with a few minutes to go, it happened.\n\nAdam Hammil hit an unstoppable shot from the edge of the box that curled into the top corner to give Scunthorpe a point that they deserved and once again left Sunderland regretting not putting the game out of sight.\n\nSunderland: McLaughlin, James, Dunne, Flanagan, O’Nien, Power, Cattermole, Gooch, McGeady, Maja (Watmore), Maguire (Wyke) Subs: Ruiter, Matthews, Oviedo, McGeouch, Baldwin\n\nScunthorpe: Alnwick, Borthwick-Jackson, McMahon, Ojo (Hammil), Perch, Novak, Thomas (Lund), Burgess, Sutton (Van Veen), McArdle, Wooton Subs: Flatt, Webster, Lewis, McGahey",

    "fullText": "Cardinals urged to replace Kyler Murray with 30-TD SEC star originally appeared on The Sporting News.

Now, the team is looking for a new coaching staff and could potentially be looking for a new quarterback as well.\n\nKyler Murray, who's been the team's passer since 2019, played in just five games this year. Even when Murray played, the results were underwhelming, and his massive contract isn't conducive to being a backup.\n\nAs a result, Jacob Infante of PFSN recently published a full seven-round mock draft that has the Cardinals taking a rookie quarterback.\n\nInfante has the Cardinals waiting until the third round and selecting Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss. Chambliss is currently in a legal battle to get one more year of college eligibility, but the expectation is that he will enter the draft.\n\nRegarding Chambliss and the Cardinals, Infante offered the following:\n\nThere are valid concerns with Trinidad Chambliss: he has an average arm, he’s undersized, and he started at the D1 level for only one year. That said, there’s also a lot to like. He’s a naturally accurate passer with impressive anticipation behind his throws, and he came in clutch in key situations for Ole Miss this year.\n\nSomeone will take a chance on him early, given how many NFL teams need quarterbacks this offseason.\n\nAs Infante mentioned, Chambliss only has one year of starting experience at the D1 level, but that one year was incredibly impressive.\n\nIn 2025 with Ole Miss, Chambliss threw for 3,937 yards with 22 touchdowns and just three interceptions. The quarterback also rushed for 527 yards and eight touchdowns, accounting for 30 total scores in 13 starts.\n\nBefore 2025, Chambliss played at DII Ferris State, where he won two national championships. The quarterback isn't the biggest, but he is bigger than Murray, and has a strong arm and nice mobility.\n\nIt wouldn't be easy to move on from Murray, though. The only way the team wouldn't have to eat a ton of dead money is if they traded Murray after June 1. In that scenario, the team would free up about $35 million in cap space.\n\nPatrick Mahomes comments on offensive coordinator Matt Nagy\n\nSteelers urged to replace Aaron Rodgers with SEC star\n\nSteelers could find new coach in a familiar place\n\nCould Steelers trade for former first-round pick?\n\nStephen A.

    "description": "Phil Smith assesses the lie of the land at the Stadium of Light, and who might be in line for an exit this month",
    "fullText": "I think everyone can agree that the summer transfer window was a huge success.\n\nThe signs are that January will be a lot quieter with the majority of work focused on outgoings. Given the numbers in the “bomb squad” — plus those out on loan — has the club left itself with a problem?\n\nObviously the most effort will go into moving on those exiled from first-team training but still at the club — and there’s has already been some success with Timothée Pembélé, Jay Matete and Joe Anderson at new clubs, leaving Abdoullah Ba and Ian Poveda looking for a way out.\n\nThere are also a few current “bench warmers” who might leave.\n\nThe most obvious one is Dan Neil, with Anthony Patterson another. However, Régis Le Bris has stated he wants a replacement before Patterson can move on, so that one is less likely. Elsewhere, Harrison Jones and Leo Hjelde might go out on loan but regardless of his contract situation, I can’t see why the club would want to move Dennis Cirkin on.​\n\nThe problem that is rapidly coming into view is what to do with the current (eight) first-team loan players. Of Niall Huggins, Patrick Roberts, Nazariy Rusyn, Jenson Seelt, Hemir, Adil Aouchiche, Alan Browne and Milan Aleksić, it appears that none — other than perhaps Seelt — has a future at the club.\n\nThat’s a lot to move on, so has the club been negligent in collecting so many players with no future? Like any club, there has been a huge turnover of players since the 2021/2022 season — some permanent, most loans.\n\nMany, such as Alex Pritchard and Danny Batth, were great servants, whereas others, like Leon Dajaku, weren’t. Maybe we lost a little on transfer deals for some players, but no huge sums. Of course, wages are also an issue, but I doubt we were paying out significant sums.\n\nRoberts and Huggins arrived in the 2021-22 season, so let’s start an analysis.\n\nOf the bomb squad, only Poveds could be classed as an “established” player and of the loanees, only Roberts, Rusyn, Browne and perhaps Aouchiche. Most new arrivals, such as Trai Hume and Eliezer Mayenda, were brought in as “ones for the future”.\n\nOf the players signed from the 2021-22 season to the end of the 2024-25 season, Hume, Dan Ballard, Romaine Mundle, Mayenda and Wilson Isidor are now first-teamers in the Premier League. Jack Clarke and Jobe Bellingham made significant contributions and delivered a large profit when they moved on, but what about the rest?\n\nWe could argue all day about what counts as a “successful” transfer. As everyone seems obsessed with data, maybe a data scientist could provide some clues.\n\nIn his book How To Win The Premier League (a great read, by the way), Ian Graham suggests that if a player purchased for more than £10 million fails to start 50% of the league games played in the following two seasons, the transfer should be classed as a failure.\n\nGraham also states that 46% of players bought for £10 million or more across all teams in the Premier League between 1992 and January 2021 failed to reach the 50% mark in the seasons immediately after their arrival.\n\nUnfortunately, that model can’t be applied to Sunderland — at least not yet. Under the current ownership, no player was purchased for anywhere near £10 million until the last transfer window, and as mentioned above, we bought more development players than established.\n\nI suggest a reasonable measure of success would be if a player participated in twenty games (roughly half a season) during their Sunderland career. This takes account of the transfer strategy, our League One/Championship status, low transfer fees and relatively low wages.\n\nFrom the “bomb squad” and loanees, only four (Pembélé, Anderson, Poveda and Aleksic) failed to hit the twenty-appearance mark. Given we found a few gems along the way and collected some hefty transfer fees, I don’t think it’s reasonable to complain.\n\nNow, just for a bit of fun, let’s apply Graham’s model to the last transfer window.\n\nTen players came in for fees rumoured to be over £10 million: Habib Diarra, Simon Adingra, Enzo Le Fée, Brian Brobbey, Chemsdine Talbi, Noah Sadiki, Granit Xhaka, Nordi Mukiele, Omar Alderete and Robin Roefs.\n\nAssuming they all stay for two seasons, then how many will pass the test? I’ll take a punt on eight. If I’m right, that’s impressive business!",

    "title": "Spreading The Word Of Sunlun At AFCON 2026!",
    "description": "For Sunderland fan Deborah Laverick, the opportunity to spread the word of Sunlun to the people of Africa at AFCON 2026 was an opportunity she couldn’t pass up!",
    "fullText": "Like most Sunderland fans, I had heard of AFCON but truthfully only knew the basics.\n\nBut after a week in Marrakech, I was increasingly aware of my Mambas, Super Eagles, Zebras, Leopards, Elephants and had even figured out that Bafana Bafana that I kept hearing about was in fact the nickname of the South Africa team and not one of their players.\n\nUpon arrival at the airport there were lots of fans milling about taking photos with AFCON displays. One lucky group of South Africans were competition winners who had been tasked with supporting their first game and they started singing as soon as they got off the plane.\n\nYou may have seen lots of empty seats at matches that did not involve Morocco. There has been lots of discussion about whether Moroccans were not supporting AFCON. Unfortunately, the experience of obtaining tickets on the digital-only platform was problematic. Before you even tried, you needed to set up a Fan ID where your phone’s NFC had to scan the chip in your passport. I know several people who never got past this process.\n\nThey also cut off ticket sales 24 hours before kick-off without prior warning. African football fans tend to purchase last minute so no doubt thousands of ticket sales were lost for each match.\n\nFor this reason, myself and several pals missed out on South Africa vs Angola, a match where I was directly emailed by the ticket office to say it was sold out, but in fact only had an attendance of 4,013.\n\nThe empty seats were such a concern that in Agadir at Egypt vs Zimbabwe, an announcement was made shortly before kick-off that the stadium had opened for free entry. Consequently, by the end of the first half the stadium had filled up with Moroccan locals.\n\nOne of the highlights for me was the Fanzone based at Camellos, which we went to for Morocco vs Comoros. We arrived several hours before kick-off and the traditional music and dancing had already started outside the entrance. The Fanzone itself was impressive. A vast space with lots of activities for kids (including what can only be described as sumo wrestling football).\n\nThere were lots of photo opportunities with AFCON posters, which were noteworthy, as Adingra was a chosen poster boy.\n\nThere was a party zone in the corporate area where the singing and dancing reached a new level of intensity and a vast viewing space with three large screens, pre-match entertainment and a stage with in-built fireworks for the big moments. Singing and dancing fans paraded in waving flags and flares and singing.\n\nWe were very excited for the atmosphere with thousands of fans packed into the viewing zone.\n\nBizarrely though, when the match started, it was watched in virtual silence. We returned to the main square at half-time to watch the screen there. Again, thousands of fans, but an unanticipated calm. Although people cheered when Morocco scored, a return to an eerie silence occurred within a minute.\n\nLater, I discussed this with locals and they asked “Were there lots of police around?” I said “Yes” and they stated “Then that is why. It would be louder if you watched in cafes.”\n\nPerhaps the strangest phenomenon was when the match finished the screens were instantly turned off and, like a dispersing flashmob, the Square returned to its usual joyful, noisy hustle and bustle. The snakes, monkeys and traditional musicians were back in place within minutes.\n\nThe Game – Ivory Coast vs Mozambique. Stade de Marrakech\n\nFinally, Christmas Eve and the big match with Mozambique’s Reinildo arrived.\n\nMy friend Nassima and I headed off in the rain on her motorbike with a bag full of last season’s strips that Sunderland AFC had kindly donated to this wannabe Mackem Santa. Epic fail, however, in forgetting my Santa hat and being unable to find a replacement in the souks.\n\nSunderland AFC had asked me to wear a red and white Reinildo shirt, and as we flew along the motorway, I heard another motorbike shout, “Hey Sunderland, Reinildo. We met you in the souks.” Now, on my first day exploring, I might have been a bit excited, running around and singing football songs with all the souk owners.\n\nSo both bikes joined in a rendition of “He’s in your head, in your head, Talbi, Talbi, Talbi ii ii.”\n\nWe arrived at the Stade de Marrakech, a stadium with a capacity of 45,240. The attendance was 13,041 which still generated a great atmosphere despite the failings of the stadium which had a running track between pitch and fans and also had some kind of artificial hybrid surface which seemed to upend players in the rain.\n\nThis was after we had had to walk about a kilometre to the stadium and go through at least six ticket checkpoints. Nassima and I gave out strips to as many fans as we could and turned our part of the stands red and white in the hope Reinildo would see.\n\nWe clocked that strips will be taken back to eight different nations spreading the Mackem joy – Mozambique, Morocco, Ivory Coast, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Denmark, America and France (from where I discovered a Talbi lookalike called Adam). Reinildo lined up as a centre-back but alas the result was not meant to be, although watching Amad score for the Ivory Coast was wonderful. To borrow from a recent Welbeck quote, we all know Amad is a Mackem at heart, so still an early Christmas pressie for this fan.\n\nAFCON was an absolute privilege to experience and I would recommend it to any fan. AFCON 2027 will take place in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. A shout out to barman Hamza who educated me on all aspects of this magnificent tournament and put the Sunderland vs Brighton match on for me.\n\nIf you would like to learn more follow the official social media which goes by the name ‘TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations’ which I found invaluable. And to give you a lasting smile on your face, enjoy Reinildo’s singing and dancing with his Mamba teammates in this YouTube clip. Cracking singing and dancing by Reinildo!\n\nI hope he brings it back to the SOL.",

    "fullText": "One player who was conspicuous by his absence when Michael Carrick named his first Manchester United squad was Joshua Zirkzee.\n\nThe Dutchman has started only four Premier League games all season, as former head coach Ruben Amorim was clearly not a fan.\n\nWith his minutes drastically reduced, the Netherlands international was keen to jump ship in January, with AS Roma pushing hard for his signature.\n\nThey had proposed an initial loan with a conditional obligation and had even submitted their contract with the 24-year-old’s representatives.\n\n25/26 season stats via Transfermarkt\n\nHowever, Amorim’s sack meant an exit was blocked and it was decided that the former Bologna ace would not be allowed to leave in winter.\n\nThe Giallorossi finally admitted defeat, but with Amad and Bryan Mbeumo back, and Benjamin Sesko’s red-hot form, the former Bayern Munich star is unlikely to start too many games.\n\nWhich is why Juventus have identified him as their Plan B in case they fail to persuade Crystal Palace to part with Jean-Philippe Mateta as per Teamtalk.\n\n“Juventus have an eye on Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee in case they fail in their bid to sign Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta, sources confirm.\n\n“There is a belief that he will still do well back in Serie A, where he had a good spell with Bologna.\n\n“Roma tried to sign him this month but ran into difficulties after Ruben Amorim departed – so even a deal for the United man would not be easy, even though he is keen on a new challenge.”\n\nDespite Joshua Zirkzee being open to the possibility, it will be a difficult deal to crack unless INEOS bring in another forward.\n\nWith Champions League qualification the goal, the co-owners cannot afford to leave Carrick short in the second-half of the campaign.\n\nThe versatile forward is currently injured, and it will be interesting to see if he makes the matchday squad for the game against Arsenal. Should his chances continue to be limited, he might yet push for an exit later in the window.\n\nFeature image Molly Darlington via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "title": "Lasses Review: Pride In Defeat As Sunderland’s FA Cup Journey Ends",
    "description": "Charlotte Patterson reports from Eppleton as Sunderland Women’s FA Cup campaign was curtailed by London City Lionesses",
    "fullText": "The Adobe Women’s FA Cup clash between Sunderland AFC Women and London City Lionesses at Eppleton Colliery Welfare Ground was always destined to be a stern test for the Lasses.\n\nWith London City arriving as one of the most possession-dominant and technically proficient sides in the competition, Sunderland knew they would need to adapt tactically to withstand the pressure, and adapt they did, shifting from their usual 4-2-3-1 formation to a more compact and defensively resilient 5-2-3 setup designed to absorb the Lionesses’ attacking waves and strike on the counter.\n\nFrom the opening whistle, the Lionesses asserted their dominance in possession, moving the ball with precision and intent.\n\nSunderland, however, weren’t passive observers and their five-player back line — marshalled superbly by Rhiannon Roberts, Hannah Greenwood and Brianna Westrup — held firm, maintaining shape and discipline. Jessica Brown and Louise Griffiths flanked the triple pairing, whilst Emily Scarr and Katie Kitching dropped deep to support defensively.\n\nGrace Moloney was largely untroubled in the opening forty five minutes. Aside from a dangerous cross that she punched clear with authority, she had little else to do — a testament to the defensive wall erected in front of her.\n\nThe Lionesses’ attempts to penetrate the final third were repeatedly thwarted, with Sunderland’s midfield duo of Natasha Fenton and Marissa Sheva working tirelessly to close passing lanes and disrupt rhythm.\n\nKitching, deployed on the wing rather than in her usual number ten role, showed tremendous work rate, tracking back and doubling up defensively when needed. Scarr mirrored that commitment on the opposite flank, never shirking her duties and often initiating the press when the Lionesses looked to build from the back.\n\nDespite the Lionesses’ territorial advantage, they were severely restricted in terms of clear-cut chances — Sunderland’s compact shape and aggressive pressing in key areas ensuring that shots on target were virtually non-existent in the first half.\n\nSunderland even had their own chances to take the lead when Eleanor Dale’s shot looked set to beat the keeper until a last-second block sent it over the bar. Fenton also went close when her shot ricocheted off the post as she aimed for the bottom corner after the set piece.\n\nThe deadlock was broken shortly after the interval.\n\nA moment of quality from the visitors saw Grace Geyoro slip the ball through to Wassa Sangaré, who timed her run perfectly and slotted past Moloney with composure. It was a cruel blow for Sunderland, who’d defended with such heart and organisation.\n\nHowever, the goal seemed to galvanise the Lasses and Sunderland began to grow into the game, pushing higher up the pitch and enjoying spells of possession. Fenton and Sheva started to find pockets of space, and Brown began to link play more effectively in midfield.\n\nSubstitutions followed as Sunderland looked to inject fresh energy and chase an equaliser.\n\nKaty Watson and Izzy Atkinson replaced Dale and Kitching in order to add some much-needed fresh legs, whilst Scarr moved into a forward position. London City responded with changes of their own, introducing their big guns in Danielle van de Donk, Saki Kumagai, Nikita Parris and Kosovare Asllani in order to regain control.\n\nDespite Sunderland’s increased intent, the visitors’ defence remained resolute.\n\nBalls into the box were swiftly dealt with, and Elene Lete was never truly tested. Sunderland’s best moments came from wide areas, with Kitching and Scarr continuing to drive forward, but the final ball lacked the precision needed to unlock the defence.\n\nSheva did have an opportunity int he dying moments of the game with a cross-shot, but it wasn’t enough to trouble the goalkeeper or to send the fans into frenzied celebrations.\n\nAs the referee blew for full time, the scoreline read 0-1 to London City Lionesses.\n\nOn paper, it was a narrow defeat; in reality, it had been a performance that spoke volumes about Sunderland’s character, determination, and tactical discipline.\n\nTo face such a technically gifted side and limit them to a single goal from a set piece was a remarkable achievement. The back line — led by Roberts and Westrup — was immense throughout, constantly organising, communicating and throwing bodies in front of shots, and Moloney’s calm presence behind them added further assurance.\n\nKitching and Scarr’s defensive contributions were vital, while Fenton and Sheva battled relentlessly in midfield. Though Sunderland didn’t manage to test Lete, their second half response showed bravery and ambition.\n\nThis tie will be remembered not for the scoreline, but for the spirit Sunderland showed. Against one of the strongest sides in the competition, they stood firm, adapted intelligently and fought for every ball. The tactical switch to a 5-2-3 was bold and effective, and the players executed it with discipline and heart.\n\nAlthough the journey ends here, the performance lays a foundation of belief as Sunderland proved they can go toe-to-toe with elite opposition, and that resilience, unity and tactical clarity can bridge gaps in quality.\n\nThe Lasses may have exited the cup, but they did so with heads held high and with the respect of everyone who witnessed their fight.\n\nThe reaction from supporters in the stands and across social media reflected a mixture of pride, frustration and admiration for the sheer resilience Sunderland showed throughout the ninety minutes.\n\nMany fans arrived at Eppleton fully aware of the scale of the challenge ahead, and that sense of realism shaped the tone of the post‑match conversation. Rather than dwelling on the defeat, the overwhelming sentiment was one of respect for a team that refused to fold under relentless pressure.\n\nSupporters were quick to highlight the tactical shift to a 5‑2‑3, acknowledging that it was a necessary adjustment against a London City side packed with technical quality and attacking threat.\n\nFans also praised the discipline with which the players executed the plan, noting how rare it is to see a team maintain concentration so consistently when forced to defend for long spells. The back line in particular drew widespread acclaim, and Roberts and Westrup were spoken about with genuine affection, with supporters describing them as “warriors, leaders, and the heartbeat of the performance”.\n\nSome remarked that the pair seemed to grow stronger the more London City pushed, organising the line with authority and throwing themselves into challenges with a commitment that resonated deeply with the crowd.\n\nThere was also a great deal of admiration for the work rate of players who were asked to operate outside their usual roles.\n\nKitching earned praise for her relentless tracking back and willingness to graft for the team, whilst Scarr received similar recognition, with fans noting how tirelessly she pressed, covered space, and supported the wing‑backs. Supporters appreciated that both players sacrificed their natural attacking instincts for the good of the collective, embodying the spirit that has long defined Sunderland sides across generations.\n\nEven in defeat, fans found encouragement in the way the team responded after going a goal down.\n\nThe shift in momentum during the second half was widely acknowledged, with many supporters commenting that Sunderland grew braver, more assertive and more confident in possession. While the final ball never quite materialised, the intent was there and fans were quick to point out that few teams manage to wrestle back any control against the Lionesses once they fall behind.\n\nThat resilience and refusal to retreat into their shells was something supporters clung to as a sign of progress and character — but of course, there was disappointment too.\n\nSome fans expressed frustration that Sunderland never truly tested Lete, feeling that the team deserved at least one clear chance to reward their defensive heroics. Others lamented the fine margins of cup football, reflecting on how a single lapse or moment of quality can decide a tie even when the overall performance is strong.\n\nBut even these frustrations were tempered by a sense of perspective. Supporters recognised the gulf in resources and squad depth between the two sides, and many commented that to lose by only one goal — and to do so while restricting the Lionesses to so few genuine opportunities — was an achievement in itself.\n\nWhat united the fanbase most was pride — pride in the fight, the discipline and the togetherness — and the applause at full time was extended and heartfelt.\n\nIt wasn’t polite appreciation of a beaten side but genuine acknowledgement of a group of players who’d emptied the tank for the badge. Online, fans echoed that sentiment, describing the performance as “brave”, “resolute”, “full of heart” and “everything you want to see from a Sunderland side”.\n\nThere was also a sense of optimism threaded through the reaction. Supporters spoke about the foundations being laid, the identity being strengthened and the belief that performances like this — even in defeat — can galvanise a squad.\n\nMany pointed out that if Sunderland can defend like that against one of the strongest sides in the competition, they can take confidence into the league and future cup campaigns. The message was clear: this wasn’t a loss that deflated the fanbase — it was one that reinforced their connection to the team.\n\nIn the end, the fan reaction captured the essence of Sunderland Women’s performance: gritty, determined, and full of character.\n\nSupporters left Eppleton knowing their team had given everything and while the cup run ends here, the pride in the performance will linger far longer than the disappointment of the result.\n\nLondon City Lionesses 1 (Geyoro 51’)\n\nSunderland: Moloney, Greenwood, Roberts; Griffiths, Scarr, Dale; Kitching, Brown, Fenton; Sheva, Westrup\n\nSubstitutes: Blench, Paxton, Finn, Cassap, McInnes, Atkinson, Watson, Jones, Blades\n\nLondon City Lionesses: Lete, Fernández, Pattinson; Pérez, Godfrey, Franssi; Roddar, Goodwin, Sangaré; Kennedy, Geyoro\n\nSubstitutes: Orman, Goldie, Corrales, Kumagai, Asllani, Van de Donk, Linari, Parris, Brown",

    "fullText": "If you occasionally find yourself pining for the days of the FA Carling Premiership — a time when Nintendo, Northern Rock and Harcros Building Supplies were advertised pitchside, VAR was merely a pipe dream and “low blocks” weren’t part of the footballing vernacular — Brian Brobbey’s display against Crystal Palace on Saturday might well have been right up your street.\n\nSimply put, it was a throwback to an era during which strikers gave as good as they got, where they took their licks but kept coming back for more, and where brute strength and determination often won out.\n\nIn the first instance, it’s important to highlight that after an understandably low-key start to his Sunderland career, Brobbey has been looking better and better with every game he’s played, and the contempt with which he treated the ball as he lashed it past Vicario at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was that of a player whose desire to prove himself in English football is as strong as the force contained within his thigh muscles and his boots.\n\nHere’s a talented footballer given a chance by Sunderland after experiencing some turbulent times at Ajax, and boy, is he determined to make the most of it.\n\nWe’d already seen glimpses of what Brobbey could do if given a chance.\n\nAfter setting up Chemsdine Talbi’s winner against Chelsea, there was a dramatic equaliser against Arsenal, a fine header against Bournemouth and of course that goal against Spurs, but as a complete performance, this was about as impressive as it gets and given the praise that was lavished on Brobbey and Sunderland’s signing of him by former Tottenham manager Martin Jol, it can only draw more positive attention and ensure that his confidence continues to soar.\n\nAgainst Palace, Brobbey was an absolute force of nature.\n\nHe bullied the visiting defence mercilessly, refused to be cowed in the face of little protection from referee Rob Jones, and completed the Sunderland comeback with a sublime finish over Dean Henderson. He was on the receiving end of plenty of rough stuff from the visiting defenders as they struggled to deal with his threat, but he kept coming back for more — the sign of a centre forward who’s certainly up for the fight.\n\nPurists may cry foul and it’s fair to say that his confrontational approach would be sniffed at by many coaches, but in an era during which we often expect strikers to combine silky skills, dead-eye accuracy in front of goal and statistics that keep the analysts happy, there’s something brutally effective and undeniably captivating about Brobbey’s style of play, and this was highlighted to devastating effect against the Eagles.\n\nCricket writer Simon Barnes once said of legendary Australian batsman Steve Waugh that he “wanted to defeat you personally” and in Brobbey’s on-pitch body language, his “no backwards steps” mentality and his fiery competitiveness, I see a striker who relishes every physical duel and every ounce of needle, and for whom getting the better of an opposing defender is a matter of real pride.\n\nWith that in mind, is Brobbey channelling the trauma of his personal strife and using it as a source of motivation every time he steps out onto the pitch?\n\nGiven what he went through and the frankly appalling troubles he endured during his latter days in Amsterdam, you could understand why he’s perhaps being driven by an almost primitive sense of rage, a burning desire to make up for any lost time and to show that the Eredivisie — itself the subject of all manner of cracks about average strikers — does in fact produce centre forwards whose game can be fine-tuned in order to suit the demands of the Premier League.\n\nOne thing is for sure: his popularity among the Sunderland fanbase is growing and it’s easy to see why Régis Le Bris has placed so much trust in him as our first-choice striker. Wilson Isidor remains a superb alternative but at the moment — and with players picked on merit — Brobbey is our spearhead and it’ll take some effort to prise that number nine shirt from his muscular torso.\n\nWe’ve always loved abrasive players who give as good as they get and in this young Dutch marksman, we seem to have signed a centre forward who combines supreme physical attributes with an eye for goal that’s starting to pay dividends on a more frequent basis.\n\nHe’s clearly working very hard. He’s operating in an environment in which players who reach and maintain certain standards will always find favour — and he’s giving seasoned Premier League defenders a hell of a battle every time he lines up in a red and white shirt.\n\nFurthermore, if the goals (and in this case, the strike that sealed victory for the Lads) continue to come, the arguments about the need for Sunderland to sign a “genuine goalscoring striker” will also be rendered moot, and that’ll be no mean feat.\n\nLet’s keep showing him the love — and hopefully he’ll continue to deliver!",

    "fullText": "NFL playoff picks, predictions: Patriots hold off Broncos, Rams upset Seahawks to advance to Super Bowl 60 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nConference championship weekend will determine who reaches Super Bowl 60 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., on Feb. 8.\n\nDenver and Seattle advanced on divisional playoff weekend.\n\nThe Broncos will host the AFC championship game for the seventh time in franchise history, but the dominant storyline is the loss of Bo Nix, who suffered a broken bone in his right ankle in the 33-30 victory against Buffalo and will be replaced by Jarrett Stidham. New England beat Houston 28-16 in the AFC divisional playoffs behind second-year quarterback Drake Maye and a defense that forced four turnovers.\n\nDenver has beaten the New England Patriots in the AFC championship game in two past meetings.\n\nThe AFC championship game will be at 3 p.m. on CBS.\n\nThe Seahawks hammered the San Francisco 49ers 49-6 in the NFC divisional playoffs. Sam Darnold earned his first playoff victory, and Kenneth Walker III had three TD runs. The Rams survived a 20-17 overtime classic at Chicago in the NFC divisional round, and Matthew Stafford has a chance to get to a second Super Bowl with coach Sean McVay, who is looking for a third appearance.\n\nHere are Sporting News' picks for the AFC and NFC Championship games (odds courtesy of Caesars):\n\nNew England Patriots (-5.5) at Denver Broncos\n\nIt is a fun coaching matchup between Sean Payton and Mike Vrabel, who can take New England to the Super Bowl in his first season.\n\nStidham made two starts with coach Sean Payton in the 2023 season. How much will the Patriots speed up the seventh-year quarterback on his reads? Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud threw four interceptions and took three sacks. The Broncos will have to rely on the running game more – which averaged just 3.2 yards per carry against the Bills. RJ Harvey and Jaleel McLaughlin need to be more effective against a Patriots’ defense that allowed 48 rushing yards against the Texans. New England’s defense that features linebackers Robert Spillane and Christian Elliss.\n\nHow much will Stidham be able to test New England in the passing game? Carlton Davis - who did not have an interception in the regular season – had two picks. The Patriots will take chances in coverage on Stidham, and Denver also has uncertainty at the receiver position. Troy Franklin suffered a hamstring injury in the divisional playoffs, and that leaves Courtland Sutton, Marvin Mims and Lil’Jordan Humphrey at receiver. How much success will the Broncos have on third down in the intermediate range?\n\nBreaking down Broncos' QB depth chart behind Bo Nix\n\nCan the Broncos still win the Super Bowl without Bo Nix?\n\nGet to know new Broncos QB1, Jarrett Stidham\n\nDenver’s defense also will face more pressure to keep this a low-scoring game. Maye will be on the spot, too, especially in his first road playoff start. The Broncos generated five turnovers and three sacks against the Bills, and linebacker Nik Bonitto had a sack and two forced fumbles. There will be opportunities against Maye, who had four fumbles against the Texans, and the pressure has to land. The Patriots can lean on the running game with Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson, and that should help Maye settle in on the road.\n\nMaye has been trustworthy on the road this season, too. He’s 8-0 with an average 273.5 yards, 17 TDs and three interceptions on the road this season. This is Maye’s first start at Empower Field at Mile High, and the Broncos were 9-1 S/U at home this season and 2-0 S/U as a home underdog. It’s still a tough environment, and the Broncos are 6-1 S/U all time at home in the AFC championship game. Pittsburgh beat Denver 34-17 in the 2005 AFC championship game on Jan. 22, 2006.\n\nPatriots defense picks apart Texans to advance to AFC Championship\n\nC.J. Stroud's four first-half INTs doom Texans\n\nWhy Patriots can't afford another sloppy Drake Maye playoff performance\n\nWhere C.J. Stroud's disastrous day ranks among most turnovers in a playoff game\n\nCan Stidham pull a Jeff Hostettler – who led the Giants to a Super Bowl XXV victory after Phil Simms was injured. Hostettler had two regular-season starts before the playoffs. A week might not be enough time for Denver here. It’s just going to be tough to pull this off without the Patriots imploding on the road.\n\nLos Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-2.5)\n\nThe two regular-season matchups were decided by a combined total of three points, including a wild 38-37 overtime thriller on Dec. 18. The NFC West rivals split the regular-season series, and three of the last four meetings at Seattle have gone into overtime.\n\nWalker is coming off a huge game, and he had 11 carries for 100 yards and a TD in the last meeting. The Rams allowed 160 rushing yards against the Bears, so Seattle can be patient with the two-headed rushing attack of Walker and Zach Charbonnet. Jared Verse has to be a difference maker off the edge for Los Angeles.\n\nThat should help Darnold – who finished 51 of 78 (65.4%) for an average of 274.5 yards, two TDs and six interceptions in the two regular-season meetings against the Rams. Jaxon Smith-Njigba had 17 catches for 201 yards and a TD in those two games, and that is the matchup Seattle needs to win consistently in the passing game. Five different Los Angeles players had interceptions in those games, and the Rams intercepted Caleb Williams three times in the divisional playoff win. Turnovers will be key here, especially on the road.\n\nHow swarming Seattle defense is peaking at right time\n\nWatch Rashid Shaheed take opening kickoff for TD\n\nThis is another opportunity for Stafford, who had a 57.1% completion percentage in those two meetings but also did not take a sack. He had 457 yards and three TDs in the last meeting. Will Seattle coach Michael Macdonald choose to dial up the pressure in order to take Stafford out of rhythm with receivers Puka Nacua and Davante Adams? Tight end Cody Parkinson had 10 carries for 90 yards and a TD in two playoff games, too. The Rams also will look to establish the running game with Kyren Williams and Blake Corum. The Seahawks allowed 5.3 yards per carry in their regular-season loss in the Rams and 3.2 yards per carry in the win.\n\nThe Rams were 4-5 S/U on the road, but they are 1-1 ATS as an underdog in the regular season, but they have won S/U as a road favorite each of the last two weeks. Seattle is 8-2 S/U and 6-4 ATS at home. The Seahawks are 3-0 S/U at home in the NFC championship game.\n\nIt's shaping up to be another instant classic between these rivals, but the Rams had a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter in that last meeting and they have survived two tough road games. Does Stafford have one more road victory in him? It's hard not to trust the MVP-caliber quarterback in this matchup.\n\nRams fend off Bears' comeback attempt to advance to NFC Championship\n\nCaleb Williams overtime interception dooms Bears\n\nWatch Caleb Williams uncork spectacular TD pass to Cole Kmet to force overtime",

    "fullText": "Morocco head coach Walid Regragui called Senegal counter-part Pape Thiaw “shameful” after he led his players off the pitch in protest during a chaotic end to the Africa Cup of Nations final.\n\nSenegal were angered by a controversial decision to award Morocco a penalty in the final minute of stoppage time and, fuelled by a sense of injustice, Thiaw called on his players to return to the dressing room.\n\nAfter a delay of around 15 minutes, talisman Sadio Mane, who had remained on the field, convinced his team-mates to return to the pitch, where Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy saved Brahim Diaz’s ‘Panenka’ penalty.\n\nSenegal went on to win their second Africa Cup of Nations title thanks to Pape Gueye’s goal in extra time, but the final and tournament was overshadowed by the chaos.\n\n“The image we’ve given of Africa is shameful,” Regragui said during his post-match press conference. “A coach who asks his players to leave the field... What Pape did does not honour Africa. He wasn’t classy. But he is a champion, so he can say whatever he wants.”\n\nSenegal are likely to face a punishment for their actions, including their head coach. Thiaw was jeered as he entered his post-match press conference in Rabat, but later accepted that Senegal had made the wrong decision.\n\n“I apologise for football,” Thiaw said in a later interview with BeIN Sport. “After reflection, I had them come back. Sometimes, you can react in the heat of the moment. We shouldn't have done it but it's done and now we present our apologies to football.”",

Rennes want really important money as they believe he’s one of the best young defenders in the world. New contacts this week to try get closer to final price and structure. Rosenior approved it.\n\n“Chelsea owners and directors are involved working on the Jacquet deal. Rennes want to go over the Doku sale, which means their request is 70m euros.”\n\nThat equates to around £60.7m. Seems like a lot of money. But I believe Chelsea will be paying slightly less than that and will pay a lower base fee and have a favourable structure for them.\n\nFormer Chelsea player and manager Ruud Gullit has been questioning whether Chelsea is the right club for the development of fellow Dutch man Jorrel Hato, in some rare comments from the former midfield player.\n\nAnd a reminder as we head back to the main story for the this one. Chelsea have already agreed personal terms with Jeremy Jacquet ahead of trying to agree the fee. So that side is all done and dusted.",

    "fullText": "The Lakers are back in the win column after taking down the Toronto Raptors 110-93 at Crypto.com Arena on Thursday behind a perfect night from their starting center, Deandre Ayton.\n\nAyton became the third player in franchise history to be perfect from the field with at least 10 shot attempts, finishing the game with 25 points and 13 rebounds on 10-for-10 shooting. He joined Wilt Chamberlain (March 11, 1969) and Mitch Kupchak (Nov. 20, 1981) as the only Lakers to do so.\n\nIt was the third time this season Ayton finished perfect from the field and with double-digit scoring.\n\nAlong with the Lakers' starting bigman's best performance of the season, Luka Dončić and LeBron James also finished with over 20 points in the Lakers' 25th win of the season.\n\nDončić made his return to the lineup after being sidelined against the Trail Blazers on Saturday, finishing with 25 points and seven assists. James played in both back-to-back games for the second time this season and in a row, finishing with 24 points, seven rebounds and four assists.\n\nAfter producing solid minutes in the road loss in Portland, Drew Timme earned more minutes from coach JJ Redick and even got words of approval from James himself after the game, resulting in the sophomore getting some early minutes against the Raptors.\n\nRedick started Timme to begin the second quarter after the Lakers struggled to a slow start, trailing 30-23 at the end of the first quarter. Redick went with a big lineup that included Marcus Smart, Jarred Vanderbilt, Drew Timme, James and Ayton to begin the second.\n\nThat group outmatched and even outperformed Toronto, outscoring them 15-3. The Lakers rode that momentum for the rest of the quarter, but Raptors big man Sandro Mamukelashvili, yes, him, gave the Lakers fits, keeping the score close. Mamukelashvili finished with 20 points on eight-of-12 shooting.\n\nThe Lakers ended the first half with a one-point lead after Dončić beat the horn with his signature patented step-back 3 that got the sold-out crowd buzzing. After a back-and-forth third-quarter start, the Lakers slowly pulled away with the score.\n\nTheir efficiency in the third kept them riding the momentum, hitting five of their 10 attempts from 3 and eight of 12 from two. The Lakers' push had them outscore the Raptors 32-26 in the third and finally put them away with a 23-13 score in the fourth.\n\nThe Lakers improved to 25-16  and 12-8 at home as they still remain in the sixth spot in the West.\n\nThey concluded five games in six days but will now go on an eight-game road trip, starting in Denver on Tuesday.",

    "description": "Under Michael Carrick, Old Trafford will have to go through a process of deAmorimisation – but there is a lopsided look to a squad that requires another rebuilding job",
    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola’s 55th birthday fell on Sunday. It may not be his happiest. The present could come in the form of Marc Guehi, when he signs. But if Guardiola’s mood may be altered by perhaps the most comprehensive derby defeat he has suffered in almost a decade in Manchester, he might have been facing another manager to celebrate a birthday in January. A year earlier, Ruben Amorim remarked that, after two months at Manchester United, he felt 50, not 40.\n\nTwo weeks after leaving, maybe Amorim is fresher-faced and youthful again. But he did win his first Manchester derby in charge. So, 13 months later, did Michael Carrick. Yet a bad day for Guardiola could also be seen as a similarly damaging one for Amorim.\n\nCarrick’s superlative start was in part an indictment of the man who was supposed to be United’s answer to Guardiola. Much that has happened in the last fortnight is that the previous interim Darren Fletcher started by switching to a back four. He conjured three goals in two games from Benjamin Sesko, after two in 17 for Amorim. Fletcher, though, did not win.\n\nCarrick did. With a back four, with flying wingers, with Bruno Fernandes as a No 10, with Kobbie Mainoo in the midfield. His choices showed a decisiveness, and the way his gameplan was executed reflected well on a coaching staff drawn from United, England and Middlesbrough. Yet the flippant explanation may be simply that Carrick did the opposite of everything Amorim did. There was a fast start, a second half that was won, a clean sheet: this was rarely the Amorim way.\n\nBut the same 11 players could have been configured in Amorim’s beloved 3-4-3. And yet, of the 10 outfield players Carrick selected, only one had really occupied the same position under Amorim this season: Casemiro as one of two central midfielders. Mainoo, after all, had not been granted a Premier League start, Lisandro Martinez and Harry Maguire had tended to play in back threes, while there were no full-backs or wingers.\n\nIt was hard to escape the sense United had been held back by dogmatic decision-making. Mainoo is an incomplete midfielder, and not a defensive one, but he is also a far better one than Amorim ever seemed to acknowledge. But for regime change, Mainoo may have been eyeing a loan move this month. Amorim deemed him Fernandes’ understudy for the No 8 position: but the captain has been the most consistently creative player in the division. His through ball for Bryan Mbeumo’s goal constituted an argument for using him as a No 10.\n\nThere is a temptation to see much of the match as a reaction to Amorim’s departure. United looked liberated. There was a bond between players and crowd which, while the match-going public never turned on Amorim, showed the public felt happier. “One important thing that Michael Carrick said was ‘use the energy of the people’,” said Martinez.\n\nA reason why United tend have an excellent record in the short-term reigns of their former players turned temporary managers is that they can seem glad to see the supposed permanent choice gone. And if that may reflect badly on the players who can deliver more for an interim, whatever their official title, than the man who was supposed to be in charge for years, it can sometimes seem a return to reason.\n\nBut if United are in a process of deAmorimisation, it comes with complications. He inherited a squad unsuited to 3-4-3 and remodelled it. Now it is imbalanced to play 4-2-3-1. Instead of a model of two players for every position, there is a lopsided look. There are three whose best position is No 10, in Fernandes, Cunha and Mason Mount, but only three who prefer to be in the centre of midfield, in Casemiro, Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte. United always intended to target midfielders this summer. They look still shorter of them now.\n\nBut after Amorim alienated and exiled Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, there is no real specialist left winger in this squad; or if Patrick Dorgu counts, after his terrific derby display, then there is a lone out-and-out left-back. All of which could mean United lack players for key roles later in the season.\n\nMeanwhile, there was always the problem that Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo could both covet the same spot, when each is clearly among United’s finest players. Amorim’s answer was often to play them as right wing-back and No 10; Carrick used them as winger and striker.\n\nPart of Amorim’s legacy was to add to United’s rebuilding job in the summer; as became clear of late, director of football Jason Wilcox’s preference was for a back four. That attempt to deAmorimise even while he was still in a job may have led to his departure.\n\nCarrick’s Premier League record in charge of United, spread across two spells, is wins over Arsenal and City, with a draw at Chelsea. It is Arsenal next, so he must hope to extend his run as the scourge of the elite. But Amorim’s greater failings came against the mid-table and bottom-half teams. United’s February and March fixture list is full of such sides. So the test, once again, will be to prove the opposite of Amorim then.",

    "fullText": "Britain's Francesca Jones sobbed loudly on court as injury wrecked her hopes of a first main-draw win at the Australian Open.\n\nEarly retirements became a theme on day two in Melbourne, with men's eighth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime and qualifier Marina Stakusic - who was taken off court in a wheelchair - both forced to retire after cramping.\n\nBritish number three Jones struggled to move from the early stages of her first-round match against Polish qualifier Linda Klimovicova on Monday.\n\nThe distraught 25-year-old valiantly tried to continue but ultimately quit when trailing 6-2 3-2.\n\nA groin injury had forced Jones out of a match at last week's Auckland International, but it was a glute problem that led to her retirement against Klimovicova.\n\nShe took a medical timeout at the end of the first set and received further attention from the physio after the third and fifth games of the second set.\n\nThe world number 71 was broken to love in the fifth game and was left in tears while receiving treatment.\n\nAfter getting back to her feet, Jones signalled to Klimovicova that she could not continue.\n\nRiverside walk & nap prepare Raducanu for dominant win\n\nThere was a sombre atmosphere on the court, with the crowd applauding sympathetically as Jones limped off with a towel covering her head.\n\nJones, who has a rare genetic condition which means she plays with a modified grip, has defied the odds to compete among the elite.\n\nAfter a difficult 2024 where she found herself outside the world's top 150, Jones planned to retire in 2025 if her ranking did not improve.\n\nInstead, she enjoyed a life-changing season that pumped new energy into her tennis career.\n\nJones had received direct entry into the Australian Open main draw for the first time, but this marked a sad exit to what had been a proud moment.\n\nThe heat hit 30C in Melbourne but it is common for players to compete in much higher temperatures. By mid-afternoon the Australian Open's heat stress scale, read 1.4 out of five - deemed 'temperature playing conditions'.\n\nCanada's Auger-Aliassime came into the Australian Open as part of the group tipped to challenge clear favourites Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner for the men's title.\n\nThe 25-year-old surged into the world's top five after finishing last season with a flourish, including a run to the US Open semi-finals.\n\nBut he fell at the first hurdle in Melbourne despite taking the opening set against Portugal's Nuno Borges.\n\n\"I can't recall ever in my life this [happening this] early in a tournament, this early in a match,\" Auger-Aliassime said after quitting when trailing 3-6 6-4 6-4.\n\n\"I don't have all the answers now.\"\n\nCramping was the root of the dramatic scenes involving Stakusic.\n\nThe Canadian world number 127 went down in the third set of her first-round match against Australia's Priscilla Hon.\n\nA rubdown with ice did not improve the spasm in Stakusic's leg, forcing her to quit when trailing 1-6 6-4 5-3.\n\nMedical staff and Hon helped her in to a wheelchair before the 21-year-old was taken off court.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": ": Revenue growth is sluggish, too",
    "fullText": "India’s big four outsourcers – HCL, Infosys, TCS and Wipro – have essentially stopped hiring, perhaps coinciding with their increased use of AI to power their practices.\n\nThe four companies have all announced quarterly results in the last ten days and appear to be in decent health. HCL reported $3.8 billion revenue, up 7.4 percent year over year. Infosys pulled in $5.1 billion, up 1.7 percent year over year. TCS revenue of $7.5 billion represented a three percent increase. Wipro’s $2.6 billion revenue represented a 5.5 percent year over year improvement.\n\nIndia’s top tech companies often hire more than 10,000 people a quarter, a rate of recruitment that more-than offsets attrition and sees their headcounts rise substantially. Wipro increased its payroll by 6,500 people last quarter and Infosys hired 5,000 more – muted growth by their standards – while TCS and HCL went backward by 11,000 and 261 people respectively.\n\nOver the last year, the four companies added just 3,910 staff, an unusually slow rate of hiring.\n\nPerhaps coincidentally, all four companies told investors they’re using more AI to deliver services for clients, either by adopting the technology to streamline their own work or by adding it to the tools they deliver to customers. Infosys has gone meta with its efforts, by creating a tool that uses AI to create Global Capability Centers, the company’s term for offshored and/or outsourced operations it runs for clients in India, that use AI to improve customers’ operations.\n\nAll also report that clients are hungry for AI expertise, so they can put the technology to work streamlining their operations. As you would expect, on earnings calls the outsourcers’ execs reached for metrics to describe their success with AI. For HCL that was pointing to 60 of its priority customers adopting one of its AI services. At TCS, the trophy win was using AI to accelerate the pace of software builds for a major client. Wipro is chuffed about the rate of adoption for its AI-infused operations tools WINGS and WEGA.\n\nThe four companies are all hiring people with AI skills as fast as they can find them while also training senior staff who are yet to wrap their heads around the tech, a new twist on the services industry’s balancing act of trying to keep margins high by having inexperienced and low-salaried juniors handle much client work after high-cost seniors lead with consultancy.\n\nInvestors weren’t spooked by what they heard, with the four companies’ share prices steady – other than Infosys, which popped five percent. ®",

    "fullText": "The Independent has some terrifying news: Apparently the opening line to Beowulf has been misinterpreted for 200 years? Hwæt:\n\nIt is perhaps the most important word in one of the greatest and most famous sentences in the history of the English language.\n\nYet for more than two centuries “hwæt” has been misrepresented as an attention-grabbing latter-day “yo!” designed to capture the interest of its intended Anglo-Saxon audience urging them to sit down and listen up to the exploits of the heroic monster-slayer Beowulf.\n\nAccording to an academic at the University of Manchester, however, the accepted definition of the opening line of the epic poem – including the most recent translation by the late Seamus Heaney - has been subtly wide of the mark.\n\nIn a new paper due to be published this month Dr George Walkden argues that the use of the interrogative pronoun “hwæt” (rhymes with cat) means the first line is not a standalone command but informs the wider exclamatory nature of the sentence which was written by an unknown poet between 1,200 and 1,300 years ago.\n\nAccording to the historical linguist, rather than reading: “Listen! We have heard of the might of the kings” the Old English of “Hwæt! We Gar-Dena in gear-dagum, þeod-cyninga, þrym gefrunon, hu ða æþelingas ellen fremedon!” should instead be understood as: “How we have heard of the might of the kings.”\n\nDr Walkden said his conclusion – based on the positioning of the word relative to the verb within 141 other clauses studied – would put him at odds with the conventional wisdom on the subject.\n\n“I’d like to say that the interpretation I have put forward should be taken into a count by future translations,” he said.\n\nThe new translation could also cast light on those that might have been listening in the flickering light of the ancient campfires to the daring tale.\n\n“It shows that perhaps the Anglo-Saxon audiences were better behaved than we thought because it doesn’t say `Oi you, listen to this!’” Perhaps they were more appreciative,” he added.\n\nThe confusion is believed to date back to Jakob Grimm, one of the Grimm Brothers, who wrote in 1837 that “hwæt” was a “pure interjection”.\n\nSince then it has variously been translated as “What ho!” “Hear me!” “Attend!” “Indeed!” and more recently “So!” by Seamus Heaney in 2000.\n\nThis is despite the research suggesting that the Anglo Saxons made little use of the exclamation mark or indeed much other punctuation beyond the full stop or the occasional semi colon.\n\nFind the full story at The Independent.",

    "title": "The War on Drugs Is Why Your Bus Never Showed Up",
    "description": "Your bus didn’t show up because someone who could have driven it wasn’t allowed to take the job. Not because they couldn’t do it safely. Because they smoked weed two weeks ago.",
    "fullText": "You’re standing at the bus stop. The app said the bus would arrive in 3 minutes. Then 5 minutes. Then it just disappears from the tracker entirely. No bus. No explanation. Just another 45-minute wait for the next one, assuming that one actually shows up.\n\nThis isn’t a story about infrastructure or funding.\n\nIt’s about United States federal drug policy.\n\nMore than 90% of transit agencies across the US can’t hire enough bus drivers.1 Not because people don’t want the jobs—because federal law won’t let them take them.\n\nIn Baltimore, one in five buses don’t complete their runs.2 LA Metro is short 600 drivers and cancels 10% of scheduled service every single day.3 Miami postponed its entire bus network redesign because it couldn’t find people to drive the new routes.4\n\nBefore the pandemic, LA Metro missed 1-2% of scheduled trips. Now it’s 10%. That’s not a marginal decline—that’s system failure.\n\nHere’s the problem: Under federal law (49 CFR Part 382), anyone with a commercial driver’s license must pass DOT drug tests that include marijuana.5 No exceptions.\n\nThis applies to every transit bus operator in America, regardless of what state law says about marijuana.\n\nNotably, these mandates do not apply to Uber or Lyft drivers.\n\nThe tests don’t measure impairment–they detect THC metabolites that linger for weeks after use.\n\nSomeone who smoked on Saturday tests positive on Monday despite being completely sober.\n\nOne positive test goes into a federal database and effectively ends your driving career.\n\nAccording to 2024 federal data, 44 million American adults used marijuana in the past month.6\n\nThat’s 15% of the US adult population—-the exact population transit agencies need to recruit from.\n\nTransit agencies are desperate to hire. They’re offering bonuses, raising wages, running recruitment campaigns.\n\nBut federal policy immediately disqualifies 15-25% of otherwise qualified applicants before they even walk in the door.\n\nThink about that math. There are 159,000 transit bus operators nationwide.7\n\nAgencies report shortages of 600-800 drivers at single large systems.\n\nThe workforce shortage is measured in thousands and federal policy is excluding millions.\n\nIn 24 states, recreational marijuana is already legal. In 38 states, medical marijuana is legal.8\n\nYou can walk into a licensed dispensary in Los Angeles, Denver, or Seattle, buy marijuana legally, use it at home on the weekend, and be permanently barred from driving a bus on Monday.\n\nEight states have passed laws explicitly protecting workers from employment discrimination based on off-duty marijuana use.9\n\nBut all those protections include an exception: they don’t apply if federal law requires drug testing. The state laws can’t override DOT regulations.\n\nSo someone in California (where marijuana has been legal for years) can be fired from a bus driving job or never hired in the first place for doing something that’s completely legal under state law.\n\nNot because they’re impaired at work, but because they tested positive for something they did on their own time that violated no state law.\n\nWhen agencies can’t hire drivers, the consequences are immediate and measurable:\n\nBuses don’t show up. Before the shortage, major agencies completed 98-99% of scheduled runs. Now many are at 85-90%. Each missed bus means missed connections, doubled wait times, and overcrowded buses when one finally arrives.\n\nRoutes get cut. Rhode Island cut service on 21 routes citing driver shortages.10 Pittsburgh reduced scheduled service by 4%.11 These aren’t strategic decisions—they’re forced reductions because there aren’t enough people to drive the buses that already exist.\n\nRiders give up. When you can’t trust the bus to show up, you stop planning your life around it. You buy a car. You take an Uber. You move closer to work. The system loses riders not because of a single bad trip, but because unreliability makes it unusable.\n\nRemoving marijuana from CDL drug testing wouldn’t cost transit agencies anything. They don’t need to buy new buses, build new facilities, or hire more mechanics. They just need access to the millions of workers federal law currently bars them from hiring.\n\nRight now agencies are spending thousands per driver on signing bonuses and retention incentives—band-aids that don’t fix the underlying problem.\n\nMeanwhile, 44 million Americans who could do the job are legally prohibited from applying.\n\nThe current policy forces agencies to compete for the 75-85% of adults who haven’t used marijuana recently, while excluding a massive pool of qualified workers for no reason related to job performance or safety.\n\nThe tests don’t measure safety. They measure past use.\n\nSomeone can be stone sober, fully capable of safely operating a bus, and still fail a marijuana test from use days or weeks earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, the same test won’t catch someone who’s exhausted, hungover, on cold medicine, or impaired by any number of other factors that actually affect driving.\n\nNew York’s Department of Labor has explicitly said employers can’t test for marijuana because the tests don’t measure workplace impairment—they measure past behavior that has no bearing on current job performance.12\n\nIf safety is the concern, there are performance-based impairment tests that measure actual ability to do the job, regardless of cause.\n\nThose tests would catch impairment from any \n\nCurrent marijuana testing doesn’t do that.\n\nFederal marijuana policy treats cannabis like heroin—Schedule I, high potential for abuse, no medical value. That classification is why transit agencies must test for it. It’s also completely divorced from reality, medical research, and the laws in 38 states.\n\nThe fix is simple: remove marijuana from DOT drug testing requirements. That’s it. Transit agencies could immediately start hiring from a pool of 44 million additional workers. Service would improve overnight at zero cost to taxpayers.\n\nThe buses exist. The routes are planned. The riders are waiting.\n\nThe only thing missing is drivers—and federal drug policy is the reason they can’t get hired.\n\nYour bus didn’t show up because someone who could have driven it wasn’t allowed to take the job.\n\nNot because they couldn’t do it safely.\n\nBecause they smoked weed two weeks ago.\n\nAmerican Public Transportation Association, Transit Workforce Shortage Study (2022) ↩\n\nGoverning, A Bus Driver Shortage Threatens Transit (October 31, 2022) ↩\n\nStreetsblog LA, Missed Runs and Crowded Buses: Metro Falls Short of Restoring Full Pre-COVID Transit Service (October 1, 2021) ↩\n\nTransitCenter, Bus Operators in Crisis (2022) ↩\n\nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, 49 CFR Part 382 - Controlled Substances and Alcohol Use and Testing ↩\n\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Key Substance Use and Mental Health Indicators in the United States: Results from the 2024 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2024) ↩\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment and Wages: Bus Drivers, Transit and Intercity (May 2024) ↩\n\nMarijuana Policy Project, Cannabis Legalization and Employment Protections ↩\n\nGovDocs, Marijuana Laws by State: Employee Protections (August 20, 2025) ↩\n\nGoverning, A Bus Driver Shortage Threatens Transit (October 31, 2022) ↩\n\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette, Port Authority to reduce service because of driver shortage (May 19, 2022) ↩\n\nAnderson Kill, New York Bans Employers From Testing (Most) Employees And Job Applicants For Marijuana (June 16, 2025) ↩",

    "description": "The Minnesota governor signed a police reform package that included tightening the criteria for the permitted use of deadly force by peace officers.",
    "fullText": "The Jan. 7, 2026, killing of Renee Nicole Good by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis sparked a wave of online claims about what the law allows when officers confront moving vehicles. Text shared in multiple social media posts appeared to cite Minnesota Statutes Section 609.066 as justification for the killing, claiming that accelerating a car toward an officer automatically \"creates an immediate, life-threatening danger\" and the officer \"doesn't need to wait until impact\" before using deadly force.\n\nMinnesota Statutes Section 609.066 is a real law that outlines when officers can use deadly force, but it doesn't mention cars. Rather than a direct quote from the law, the text shared in social media posts appeared to be an internet user's interpretation of the law in the context of the Good killing. We've reached out to the user who appeared to have first shared the text to ask whether they meant it as commentary or intended to suggest that the law literally contained this language.\n\nSome posts that shared the text also claimed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz had signed the law into effect. Walz did, in 2020, sign a police reform package that included tightening the criteria for the use of deadly force outlined in Section 609.066, but he did not create the law, which has been in effect since 1978.\n\nSection 609.066 specifically concerns Minnesota peace officers. Because the officer who shot Good is a federal agent, the Minnesota peace officer statute does not apply to his actions.\n\nThe Jan. 7, 2026, killing of Renee Nicole Good in her car by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis sparked a wave of online claims about what the law allows when officers confront moving vehicles after federal authorities said the agent fatally shot Good, who was in her car, in an act of self-defense.\n\nIn the days that followed the shooting, one widely shared piece of text appeared to cite Minnesota Statutes Section 609.066 as justification for the killing. According to the posts, that law asserts that if a driver accelerates toward an officer standing in front of a car, that automatically creates an \"immediate, life-threatening danger\" and the officer \"doesn't need to wait until impact\" before using deadly force.\n\nOne X post (archived) making the claim that the officer acted legally under Minnesota law read:\n\n🚨Minnesota Statutes § 609.066\nIf a driver accelerates toward an officer standing in front of the vehicle, this creates an immediate, life-threatening danger.\n\nThe officer doesn't need to wait until impact; they can act based on the apparent intent and proximity.\n\nThe purported law spread across social media platforms, including Instagram, TikTok, X and Facebook, with some users posting the text in comment threads under news coverage about the shooting.\n\nSome versions paired the same text with an additional claim that it was \"signed into law by Governor Tim Walz on July 23, 2020,\" after \"a special legislative session.\"\n\nHowever, the alleged paragraph was not a direct quote from Minnesota Statutes Section 609.066. The real statute sets a case-by-case standard requiring an objectively reasonable belief, based on the totality of the circumstances, that deadly force is necessary. It doesn't directly address the scenario of a car driving toward an officer — in other words, the text shared in social media posts appeared to be an internet user's interpretation of the law in the context of Good's killing.\n\nMoreover, while Walz did, on July 23, 2020, sign a police reform package that amended Minnesota's existing use-of-force laws, those changes did not add the wording being shared online.\n\nFinally, the law mentioned in the post was a state law — it wouldn't govern a federal agent such as the ICE officer who shot Good.\n\nThe claim circulated in two main versions. The first was as a legal-sounding passage presented as either a quote or a summary of Minnesota Statutes Section 609.066 and the second version claimed the \"bill was signed into law by Governor Tim Walz on July 23, 2020.\"\n\nThe earliest instance of the text we found dates to Jan. 7, 2026, when the X account @ScummyMummy511 posted it along with an image seeming to show Good's car about to hit the officer.\n\nAs we previously reported, the user admitted the image featured in the post was generated using artificial intelligence. While federal officials described the shooting as self-defense and said Good used her vehicle to strike or threaten an ICE agent, multiple independent analyses of the available video found the SUV's front wheels turned to the right as it began moving forward and the shots were fired as the vehicle moved past the agent.\n\nThe earliest example we found linking the claim to Walz's signature was a Facebook post by Eric Chance Stone (archived). The account's description read, \"Destroyer of False Narratives.\" Other users shared the same text, often as a screenshot of that post.\n\nWe contacted both users to ask for the source of their information and whether they meant the posts as commentary rather than a literal reflection of Minnesota law, and we'll update this article if they respond. It's worth noting that the @ScummyMummy511 X user's account had a label reading \"Parody account\"; it was unclear whether they meant the text in the post satirically.\n\nThe wording that spread across social media posts does not appear in Minnesota law.\n\nSection 609.066 of the Minnesota Statutes, titled \"Authorized use of deadly force by peace officers,\" defines \"deadly force\" as force used to cause, or that creates a substantial risk of causing, death or great bodily harm, and it treats the intentional discharge of a firearm \"at a vehicle in which another person is believed to be\" as deadly force.\n\nHowever, the statute doesn't literally say that a vehicle moving toward an officer automatically makes deadly force lawful, like the paragraph shared on social media suggests. Rather, it states the use of deadly force is justified only if an objectively reasonable officer would believe it is necessary to protect against death or great bodily harm, emphasizing the \"totality of the circumstances.\"\n\nSubdivision 2 of Minnesota Statutes Section 609.066, titled \"Use of deadly force,\" states in full:\n\n(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 609.06 or 609.065, the use of deadly force by a peace officer in the line of duty is justified only if an objectively reasonable officer would believe, based on the totality of the circumstances known to the officer at the time and without the benefit of hindsight, that such force is necessary:\n\n(1) to protect the peace officer or another from death or great bodily harm, provided that the threat:\n\n(i) can be articulated with specificity;\n\n(ii) is reasonably likely to occur absent action by the law enforcement officer; and\n\n(iii) must be addressed through the use of deadly force without unreasonable delay; or\n\n(2) to effect the arrest or capture, or prevent the escape, of a person whom the peace officer knows or has reasonable grounds to believe has committed or attempted to commit a felony and the officer reasonably believes that the person will cause death or great bodily harm to another person under the threat criteria in clause (1), items (i) to (iii), unless immediately apprehended.\n\n(b) A peace officer shall not use deadly force against a person based on the danger the person poses to self if an objectively reasonable officer would believe, based on the totality of the circumstances known to the officer at the time and without the benefit of hindsight, that the person does not pose a threat of death or great bodily harm to the peace officer or to another under the threat criteria in paragraph (a), clause (1), items (i) to (iii).\n\nMoreover, Minnesota Statutes Section 609.066 governs the use of deadly force by Minnesota peace officers. Minnesota's Peace Officer Standards & Training Board notes it regulates Minnesota peace officers, but \"does not license or regulate standards for federal officers\" such as U.S. Marshals, FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration agents, Border Patrol \"or others employed by the federal government.\" In other words, the quoted law wouldn't be the rule governing an ICE agent such as the federal officer who killed Good.\n\nFinally, Walz did sign a real police reform package on July 23, 2020 — the Minnesota Police Accountability Act. Among other changes, the law amended Minnesota Statute Section 609.066, Subdivision 2 (\"Use of deadly force\"), first passed in 1978, tightening the standard to emphasize that deadly force is justified only when an \"objectively reasonable\" officer would believe it is necessary, based on the totality of the circumstances and without the benefit of hindsight, and adding specific threat criteria. Those revisions took effect March 1, 2021.\n\nA screenshot showing how the text changed is embedded below:\n\nTherefore, the reform didn't insert the phrasing shared in the posts. It revised Section 609.066 to stress an objectively reasonable standard based on the totality of the circumstances and added specific threat criteria — a framework that could apply some vehicle-related cases, although the law doesn't directly mention that scenario.\n\nFor further reading, Snopes has investigated many rumors involving Good's death, including a claim that video showed a federal officer defacing a memorial to her.\n\n\"Anger and Outrage Spills onto Minneapolis Streets after ICE Officer's Fatal Shooting of Renee Good.\" AP News, 8 Jan. 2026, https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-immigration-enforcement-crackdown-woman-shot-5158ce0838305b491c95db97b970cd03.\n\nChapter 1 - MN Laws. https://www.revisor.mn.gov/laws/2020/2/1/#laws.0.9.0:~:text=Sec.%2010.,March%201%2C%202021.

The ‌number of deaths rose to 11.31 million from 10.93 million in 2024, figures from China's ‍National Bureau of Statistics showed.\n\nChina's population has been shrinking since 2022 and is ageing rapidly, and has complicated Beijing's plan to boost ​domestic consumption and rein in debt, with hundreds of ‌millions of people set to leave the workforce at a time when pension budgets are already stretched.\n\nMarriages in China plunged by a fifth in 2024, the biggest drop on record, with more than 6.1 million couples registering ⁠for marriage, down from 7.68 million ​in 2023.\n\nMarriages are typically a leading ​indicator for birth rates in China.\n\nIn the coming year, however, the country may see a slight ‍temporary increase ⁠in births, demographers said, after China in May 2025 started allowing couples to get married anywhere in the ⁠country - instead of their place of residence - making the process easier.\n\n(Writing ‌by Farah Master in Hong Kong; Editing by ‌Christopher Cushing and Kate Mayberry)",

    "description": "Biochar could potentially capture a few billion tons of environmentally damaging gases every year.",
    "fullText": "A novel way to counter climate change is taking place in the German port city of Hamburg.\n\nIt's a process that begins with cocoa bean shells going in one end of a factory and coming out as a black powder called biochar, which is doing its part to slow climate change.\n\nBiochar is a black powder also known as \"black gold,\" and it's produced by — in this case — heating cocoa husks in a room that has no oxygen to a temperature of 1,112 degrees Fahrenheit, according to Phys.org. Biochar producers can also use other organic wastes as raw materials.\n\nThe process prevents plant-warming toxic gases from entering the atmosphere, and the final product can be turned into fertilizer or an ingredient for concrete that is environmentally friendlier than traditional concrete, per Phys.org.\n\nBiochar captures the carbon dioxide present in the husks of the cocoa shells from the European plant mentioned above, and this method can be implemented by any other facility.\n\nIf the cocoa shells were discarded conventionally, the carbon within the unused byproduct would be released into the atmosphere during its decomposition.\n\nRather than following the usual disposal method, where the carbon within the unused cocoa shells would be released into the atmosphere, which heats up the planet, it is instead stored in the biochar for a very long time.\n\nDavid Houben, an environmental scientist at the UniLaSalle Institute in France, told Phys.org that the biochar could hold onto the planet-warming gas for centuries.\n\nThe United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says that biochar could potentially capture billions of tons of the environmentally damaging gases released by our species every year.\n\nThis is important because human activities, such as electricity production and transportation, spew around 77 billion tons of planet-warming gases into the atmosphere each year. So far, this warming has triggered an increase in heatwaves, floods, droughts, and forest fires over the past few decades.\n\nSome experts believe implementing renewable energy to reduce the amount of planet-warming emissions into the atmosphere isn't enough and that it may already be too late to prevent the most damaging effects of a warming planet.\n\nThat's why carbon sequestration, or the process of removing the planet-warming gases we've already injected into the atmosphere, is considered so important by many climate experts, and the use of biochar does exactly that.\n\nHowever, the production of biochar is still difficult to scale up to the levels where it could actually slow the overheating of the planet.\n\n\"To ensure the system stores more carbon than it produces, everything needs to be done locally, with little or no transport. Otherwise it makes no sense,\" Houben, the environmental scientist, told Phys.org.\n\nHowever, even though challenges remain, the number of biochar initiatives is increasing rapidly. As reported by Phys.org, the production of biochar is expected to nearly double this year compared to last year.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for easy tips to save more, waste less, and help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "fullText": "Designing a Formula 1 engine has helped Ford gain the edge against Chinese cars, Ford's CEO Jim Farley said.\n\nFord announced in 2023 that it would supply Oracle Red Bull Racing with its engines from 2026. On Friday, Red Bull unveiled its car for the 2026 Formula 1 season, powered by the Red Bull Ford Powertrains engine.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg published on Sunday, Farley was asked how developing the engine has helped him deliver better value for his customers.\n\n\"It's a long list, but I would say the real signature for me is really the software — the control software for the hybrid system, predictive failure components,\" Farley said.\n\nAnd designing better software is a key step to beating Chinese cars, he said.\n\n\"These are the essence of the new software-defined vehicle globally to beat China, and they are really good,\" he added. \"We need these capabilities from Formula 1, and we can put them right in the Transit van.\"\n\nWorking on the F1 engine with Red Bull has helped Ford understand LLMs and predict component failures, which can benefit both Red Bull driver Max Verstappen and Ford's customers.\n\nThis is not Ford's first foray into F1. It supplied engines for the race from 1967 until 2004.\n\nFarley has, on several occasions, gushed about the tech capabilities of China's automobiles. In October 2024, he said he had been driving an EV from the Chinese tech giant Xiaomi for half a year and didn't want to give it up.\n\nAnd in July, speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Farley said, \"They have far superior in-vehicle technology,\" citing Xiaomi's phone-to-car pairing capabilities.\n\nChinese automobile companies, particularly EV makers, have gone all in on smart technology in recent years. An executive of CATL, a Chinese EV battery manufacturer, said during the World Economic Forum last year that China's automakers were retiring the traditional term \"EVs\" in favor of \"EIVs,\" or electric intelligent vehicles.\n\nAnd after the Chinese AI company DeepSeek launched its R1 model last year, major automakers like BYD, Geely, and Great Wall Motor said they would integrate it into their cars.",

    "description": "Harvey's CEO reveals the demo tactic that helped him win early customers for his legal AI startup: Going straight at lawyers' arguments.",
    "fullText": "Harvey's CEO says his earliest demos worked because they went straight for lawyers' arguments.\n\nWinston Weinberg said in an episode of the \"Sequoia Capital\" podcast published Thursday that once he got lawyers on a call to demo his legal AI tool, he knew he had only seconds to grab their attention.\n\nInstead of walking through features, the cofounder and chief executive of the legal AI startup pulled publicly available court filings that the lawyers had written and prompted Harvey to critique them.\n\n\"I would try to come up with prompts that were like, 'This is bad,'\" Weinberg said.\n\n\"Because they're a litigator and I'm basically attacking something that they just wrote, they would instantly read the screen,\" he added.\n\nWeinberg said the approach was risky because early versions of the tool could hallucinate, and a bad output could kill a conversation instantly.\n\n\"But the times that they got it right, it was over,\" Weinberg said, referring to moments when the analysis landed and won the lawyer's attention.\n\nHarvey is one of the most closely watched startups in legal AI, aiming to transform how Big Law firms work. In December, the company said it had reached a valuation of $8 billion after a funding round led by A16z.\n\nWeinberg said he relied on cold outreach in Harvey's early days, messaging thousands of lawyers on LinkedIn to secure early calls.\n\n\"I'd been practicing law for like eight months,\" Weinberg said of the period when he started the company. \"I didn't have any connections.\"\n\nThe legal AI sector is expanding fast, and Weinberg said the scale of the opportunity is forcing constant change inside Harvey.\n\nHe said the company's rapid growth has pushed him to \"reinvent\" himself as a founder every few months, often rethinking leadership hires and company structure to keep up with demand.\n\nDespite Harvey's rise to an $8 billion valuation, Weinberg has played down the idea of a single dominant winner in legal tech. In a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" session last month, he said the market is simply too large.\n\n\"There are around 10 million global legal professionals, and Harvey serves just single-digit percentage points of them,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think a single player is going to capture all of the pretty enormous amount of value that will be created in the next 10 years in this space,\" he added.\n\nWeinberg said the global legal market is worth roughly $1 trillion, yet only about $30 billion is spent on technology.\n\nInvestor interest has followed the shift. Legal-tech startups raised $3.2 billion last year, according to Business Insider's December analysis of Crunchbase data and deals.\n\nAI adoption is also accelerating inside law firms. Five of the 10 largest US law firms by revenue told Business Insider in July that they were using AI in their workflows, including for document review and spotting compliance risks.",

    "description": "\"I am happy every day that I have an opportunity to do new work or find new work or you know, experience something, even nature,\" Patti Smith said.",
    "fullText": "Patti Smith, 79, says aging hasn't slowed her down. Instead, it's made her more determined to keep creating for as long as she can.\n\nDuring an appearance on Monday's episode of \"Talk Easy with Sam Fragoso,\" the punk icon spoke about her decadeslong career and how aging has sharpened her awareness of time.\n\n\"I'm going to be 79 years old. You know, my mother only lived to be 82 and suddenly, chronology has a different meaning,\" Smith told podcast host Sam Fragoso. Smith turned 79 on December 30.\n\nSmith said she \"never thought a whole lot\" about how much time she had left, but that's changed in recent years.\n\n\"Because I've always sort of been a youngish person and always, you know, survived whatever came up. But you start thinking about it, you know, not intentionally, but you know, when I think about it, in just a little over a year, I'll be 80 years old. That's a number,\" Smith said.\n\n\"And I have so much to do and so many things I want to do, so many things I want to write,\" she said.\n\nSmith added that she sometimes experiences feelings that are \"a little dark.\"\n\n\"Sometimes we feel disenfranchised, even from ourselves, but we come back like a boomerang,\" she said.\n\nBut even at her age, Smith says she still sees herself as a worker.\n\n\"I work every day. I work hard. It might not always be something that the people will see or anyone will benefit by, but I do my work. Whether it's a domestic task or writing a poem or doing a performance or speaking to you, I do my work,\" she said.\n\nDuring the conversation, Smith also reflected on the losses she has experienced over the years.\n\nHer husband, Fred Smith, died of heart failure in 1994, a few weeks before her brother died after a stroke. Smith had previously lost her longtime pianist, Richard Sohl, in 1990 and her close friend and collaborator, Robert Mapplethorpe, in 1989.\n\nSmith said that caring for her two young children gave her a reason to keep going.\n\n\"And I love life, you know. I've always loved life,\" she said, adding that she has \"always fought to live.\"\n\n\"I am happy every day that I have an opportunity to do new work or find new work or you know, experience something, even nature,\" Smith said.\n\nWhen asked how she manages to keep moving forward, she said desire has always been her driving force.\n\n\"At the worst of times, I didn't ever have a moment where I didn't want to live. I could say I didn't want to have to live without Fred, but in the end, I didn't want to end my life, you know?\" she said.\n\nShe also believes in the resilience of humans and says that she tries not to take the loss of her loved ones personally.\n\n\"In fact, people have often said, 'I can't believe of all that happened to you,' and I would say, 'It didn't happen to me, it happened to them,'\" she said.\n\nInstead, Smith says those trials she faced in life have made her want to live more fiercely.\n\n\"I'm just one of those people that just wants to live. I mean, I'd love to live till 102,\" she said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Smith has talked about growing older. In May 2024, she spoke about coming to terms with her changing appearance on the \"Wiser Than Me with Julia Louis-Dreyfus\" podcast.\n\n\"I had a very youthful appearance for a long time. And in the last couple of years, I can see my aging process. So I felt OK, as long as I do good work. As long as I can do good work and can be reasonably pleased with my appearance. That's fine with me. I'm not so deeply connected with that anymore,\" Smith said.",

    "title": "Americans Are Embracing Toyota’s Electrified Lineup at Record Levels",
    "description": "Toyota’s 2025 results prove that hybrids are the heart of the U.S. market. With nearly 50% of sales now electrified, models like the Camry and RAV4 are leading a pragmatic shift toward efficiency, even as full EVs and hydrogen models remain niche.",
    "fullText": "Despite widespread discussion about slowing momentum for fully electric vehicles in the United States, Toyota’s latest sales results tell a very different story about electrification as a whole. In 2025, the Japanese automaker achieved a milestone year in the U.S. market, proving that while battery-electric vehicles may face headwinds, consumer demand for electrified powertrains remains exceptionally strong.\n\nAccording to official figures, Toyota sold a total of 1,051,397 electrified vehicles in the United States during 2025. This figure includes hybrids, fully electric vehicles, and a small number of hydrogen fuel-cell models. Put into perspective, nearly 49 percent of all Toyota vehicles sold last year were powered at least in part by an electric motor.\n\nCompared with 2024, Toyota’s electrified vehicle sales grew by 19 percent, a substantial increase for a brand that already operates at a massive scale. The primary driver behind this growth is clear: hybrids.\n\nThe best example is the Toyota Camry, which is now offered exclusively as a hybrid in the U.S. market. In 2025, Camry recorded an impressive 316,185 sales, reinforcing Toyota’s decision to fully commit its most popular sedan to hybrid-only power.\n\nThe Toyota Corolla Hybrid also delivered its strongest sales year ever, reflecting growing acceptance of hybrid technology among mainstream buyers. Meanwhile, the large SUV Toyota Sequoia, now sold only as a hybrid, further strengthened Toyota’s electrification strategy by proving that even traditionally fuel-hungry segments can successfully transition to hybrid powertrains.\n\nWhile hybrids continue to surge, Toyota’s fully electric and hydrogen-powered models tell a more modest story. The brand’s sole battery-electric offering, marketed under the Toyota bZ nameplate, saw sales decline by 15.9 percent year over year. Deliveries fell from 18,570 units in 2024 to 15,609 in 2025.\n\nAn even sharper drop affected the hydrogen-powered Toyota Mirai, where demand fell by 57.9 percent. Sales decreased from 499 units in 2024 to just 210 vehicles last year. In absolute terms, however, hydrogen models remain a very small part of Toyota’s overall sales picture in the United States.\n\nThese results make one thing clear: at least for now, hybrids are the backbone of Toyota’s electrification success, while full EVs and fuel-cell vehicles play a supporting role.\n\nWhen results from Toyota’s luxury division are included, the impact of electrification becomes even more pronounced. Across Toyota Motor North America, electrified vehicles accounted for 47 percent of total U.S. sales in 2025.\n\nAt Lexus, electrified models made up 35.6 percent of total sales, marking a new record for the brand. Lexus delivered 131,851 vehicles equipped with partial or full electrification, underscoring how hybrid systems are increasingly accepted even in the premium segment.\n\nCombined, Toyota and Lexus delivered a total of 1,183,248 electrified vehicles in the U.S. market during 2025.\n\nFrom an industry standpoint, these numbers are highly significant. They demonstrate what happens when a high-volume manufacturer transitions its most popular models to hybrid-only configurations while simultaneously expanding hybrid availability across its lineup. The recent introduction of hybrid variants for traditionally rugged models like the Toyota 4Runner and Toyota Tacoma is likely to push these figures even higher.\n\nRather than betting everything on fully electric vehicles, Toyota’s multi-path strategy appears well aligned with current U.S. consumer preferences, where buyers seek improved fuel efficiency and lower emissions without the range anxiety or charging concerns associated with EVs.\n\nGiven the current trajectory, it would not be surprising if electrified vehicles surpass the 50 percent mark of Toyota’s U.S. sales as early as this year. At this point, the question is no longer whether Toyota will cross that threshold, but when.\n\nIn a market often portrayed as cooling on electrification, Toyota’s results highlight a more nuanced reality: Americans may be cautious about going fully electric, but they are embracing electrification in forms that fit seamlessly into their daily lives.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Autorepublika.com and has been republished with permission by Guessing Headlights.

    "description": "Iraq announces full withdrawal of US forces from its federal territory",
    "fullText": "Iraq’s government on Sunday said US forces had completed a “full withdrawal” from military facilities within the country’s federal territory, which excludes the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region where US troops remain.\n\nIraq’s defense ministry said the final contingent of US advisers had departed from Al-Asad Air Base in Anbar province in western Iraq, which hosted US troops for more than two decades.\n\nThe US military has been drawing down for several years after the Iraqi government called for it do so in 2023\n\nThe US-led coalition to fight against the Islamic State group, also withdrew from the Joint Operations Command headquarters, leaving the installations under full control of Iraqi security forces, the ministry statement added.\n\nUS forces still remain at Harir Air Base in Erbil province, located in the Kurdistan Region. Iraq’s central government does not fully control the Kurdish region in northern Iraq as it’s an autonomous federal entity with its own government, parliament and security forces, recognized by the Iraqi constitution.\n\nThe US military presence in Iraq has fluctuated greatly since the 2003 invasion. At its height, the US had 170,000 troops in Iraq. In 2011, former President Barack Obama withdrew US forces from the country. Around 5,000 troops were deployed to Iraq in 2014 at the request of the Iraqi government, seeking US assistance in the fight against ISIS.\n\nFrom December 2021, when the US military announced the end of its combat role in the country, the US has had roughly 2,500 troops in Iraq in an advise and assist capacity.\n\nThe Iraqi ministry released a video Saturday showing senior Iraqi military commanders walking through empty halls and corridors inside Al-Asad Air Base.\n\nThe US Department of Defense’s Central Command told CNN Sunday that “Iraqi Ministry of Defense’s earlier statement indicating the handover were factual,” without providing further details.\n\nThe withdrawal comes amid regional tensions between the US and Iran, as US President Donald Trump considers whether to strike Iran amid deadly street protests against the country’s authoritarian regime.\n\nUS forces stationed at the Al-Asad base have been attacked scores of times over the years by Iran and Iranian-backed groups.\n\nIn January 2020, Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on US forces at Al-Asad in retaliation for a drone strike at a Baghdad airport that killed Iran’s most powerful military commander, Qasem Soleimani. The heavy bombardment lasted for around two hours, targeting only the US areas of the shared base.\n\nFollowing the October 7, 2023, terror attacks in Israel, Iran-aligned militia groups launched a series of missile strikes on Al-Asad. In August 2024, five US service members and two US contractors were injured in an attack.\n\nIraqi officials on Sunday said its armed forces across all branches possess sufficient capability to secure the country and the future cooperation with the US will center on training, equipment acquisition, joint exercises, and operational coordination under bilateral agreements.\n\nWhile Iraq considers the coalition mission concluded on its territory, officials noted that coalition operations against ISIS and other terror groups continue in Syria. Baghdad expects logistical support to transit through the coalition’s air base in Erbil and did not rule out joint US-Iraqi counter-ISIS operations launched from Al-Asad if deemed necessary.\n\nThe US withdrawal may strengthen the government’s position in negotiations over the disarmament of non-state armed groups, as some of Iran-backed militias have cited the US presence to justify retaining their weapons.\n\nMilitias like Kataib Hezbollah and Harakat al-Nujaba, among Iraq’s most powerful armed groups and designated by the US as “terrorist entities,” rejected disarmament. They said they would surrender their weapons only once Iraq achieves full sovereignty, including the withdrawal of foreign forces from Iraq.\n\nThere were no immediate comments from the militias regarding the announcement. Although many have formally integrated into the Popular Mobilization Forces, they remain influential actors in Iraq’s security, political, and economic spheres.\n\nCNN’s Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed reporting.",

    "title": "Mortgage and refinance interest rates today, January 18, 2026: Weekly rates drop by 19 basis points",
    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance rates, which are down across the board since this time last week. The 30-year rate is under 6%. Lock in your rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nCurrent mortgage rates are under 6%. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has decreased by 19 basis points over the last month and is now 5.90%. The 15-year fixed rate has dropped by 16 basis points in this time, now sitting at 5.36%. To take advantage of today's low mortgage rates, shop with several mortgage lenders to find the best deal.\n\nMORE: Sub-6% rates: See which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nLearn whether now is a good time to refinance your mortgage.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage terms and interest rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use. It also considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when determining your estimated monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a more realistic idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate today is 5.90%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is lower than with a shorter-term loan.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.36% today. When deciding between a 15-year and a 30-year mortgage, consider your short-term versus long-term goals.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to accumulate. But the trade-off is that your monthly payment will be higher as you pay off the same amount in half the time.\n\nLet’s say you get a $300,000 mortgage. With a 30-year term and a 5.90% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,779, and you’d pay $340,587 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.36% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,429. But you’d only pay $137,224 in interest over the years.\n\nWith a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for the entire life of your loan. You will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage, though.\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a predetermined period of time. Then, the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remaining 23 years of your term.\n\nAdjustable rates typically start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, it’s possible your rate will go up. Lately, though, some fixed rates have been starting lower than adjustable rates. Talk to your lender about its rates before choosing one or the other.\n\nRead more about fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, great or excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So, if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nWaiting for rates to drop probably isn’t the best method to get the lowest mortgage rate right now. If you’re ready to buy, focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate.\n\nTo find the best mortgage lender for your situation, apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four companies. Just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame — doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score.\n\nWhen choosing a lender, don’t just compare interest rates. Look at the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR) — this factors in the interest rate, any discount points, and fees. The APR, which is also expressed as a percentage, reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money. This is probably the most important number to look at when comparing mortgage lenders.\n\nLearn 6 tips for choosing a mortgage lender.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate for purchasing a home is 5.90%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.36%. But these are national averages, so the average in your area could be different. Averages are typically higher in expensive parts of the U.S. and lower in less expensive areas.\n\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.91% right now, according to Zillow. However, you might get an even better rate with an excellent credit score, sizable down payment, and low debt-to-income ratio (DTI).\n\nNot much. According to its December forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.4% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate above 6% through next year, yet dipping down to 5.9% in Q4 2026.\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction. Choose the best mortgage lender for your needs.\n\nA mortgage refinance involves replacing your original home loan with a new one.

    "fullText": "It was bound to happen eventually, and it appears the calendar flipping to 2026 was the right time for one person to publicly consider that the question surrounding aliens may not be a \"what if,\" but instead, a \"when?\" There has been an increasing number of theories and beliefs surrounding the existence of aliens, and the topic has seemingly intensified over the past year. Now, a longtime former employee who spent 10 years at The Bank of England, has reportedly flipped the switch from theories to a full-blown warning about extraterrestrial life. Interestingly, one of the biggest reported driving factors behind this warning stems from the United States, and the belief that a significant disclosure is on the horizon.\n\nIn a story that features no shortage of eye-opening tidbits, Helen McCaw, who served as a senior analyst in financial security at The Bank of England, sent a message to the bank with a significant alien warning. The short of it? McCaw wrote to Andrew Bailey, the bank's governor, urging him to prepare for the possibility that the United States, specifically the White House, may confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life, as The Sunday Times reported.\n\nMcCaw's overarching concern includes her belief that if the White House were to declare this, it would significantly impact the markets and could ignite bank collapses. She cited the United States appearing to be \"partway through a multi-year process to declassify and disclose information\" regarding alien life forms, per The Times.\n\n\"The United States government appears to be partway through a multi-year process to declassify and disclose information on the existence of a technologically advanced non-human intelligence responsible for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs),\" she claimed.\n\nWhile there are no shortage of outspoken believers in extraterrestrial life issuing warnings and discussing the topic across social media platforms, the comments coming from a longtime member of the UK's central bank will undoubtedly turn heads.\n\nThe longtime Bank of England employee expanded on the topic, discussing the possibility of a \"power or intelligence greater than any government,\" referencing the \"unknown intentions\" that would come with it. McCaw added to her belief that the government's leadership and central banks may not be \"properly briefed\" on the topic of aliens or other life forms.\n\n\"If the UAP proves to be of non-human origin, we may have to acknowledge the existence of a power or intelligence greater than any government and with potentially unknown intentions,\" McCaw said.",

    "description": "Hundreds of delegates from Vietnam's ruling Communist Party gathered on Monday under tight security for a congress that will select the single-party",
    "fullText": "HANOI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Hundreds of delegates from Vietnam's ruling Communist Party gathered on Monday under tight security for a congress that will select the single-party country's top leader and set economic goals for the remainder of the decade.\n\nThe week-long event, which ​operates under opaque rules and convenes every five years, could cement and possibly expand power for the party's current general secretary, To Lam, who ‌has launched sweeping bureaucratic reforms at home and become Vietnam's public face overseas.\n\nLater in the week, on an unspecified day, about 1,600 delegates will elect a 200-person Central Committee, which will then pick ‌from a pre-arranged shortlist up to 17 to 19 members of the Politburo from which the general secretary is chosen.\n\nLam is seeking to retain his role and possibly take on the state presidency, which has recently been held by a military leader, officials briefed on the matter said. Lam, photographed smiling in state media as he entered the congress venue on Monday, is expected to address delegates on Tuesday.\n\nThe congress is likely to confirm him as general secretary, according to multiple officials, although surprises ⁠cannot be ruled out, while the decision about the presidency ‌is expected to be made at a later meeting where the outcome is even less clear.\n\nAfter the congress, the Politburo will nominate the heads of state, government and Parliament. Parliamentary elections will take place only after leaders are chosen by the ‍party.\n\nLam, 68, has launched several major reforms during his brief tenure as party chief, the country's most powerful job. He ascended to the position following the death of his predecessor, Nguyen Phu Trong, in July 2024.\n\nWidely viewed as a risk-taker, Lam introduced the most significant administrative reform in decades when he cut tens of thousands of jobs in an ​effort to speed up decisions. The impact has yet to be fully assessed as officials adapt, but approval timelines for some investment projects have shortened.\n\nThat ‌acceleration is tied in part to the scaling back of a sweeping anti‑corruption drive launched under Trong, an effort that Lam helped lead as public security minister. The campaign, which was meant to combat systemic bribery, at times paralysed government decision‑making and led to the downfall of senior figures - including two presidents - clearing Lam's path to the top.\n\nLam has also launched economic reforms and a burst of infrastructure projects, winning favour with foreign investors while stoking concerns about favouritism and waste.\n\nIn a country that allows no opposition, Lam has presided over a strengthening of the security forces and a tightening of controls over media and other critical ⁠voices.\n\nECONOMIC GROWTH, SECURITY TOP NEXT FIVE-YEAR AGENDA\n\nThe congress' delegates represent 5.6 million party members in ​a country of 100 million.\n\nUnder tight security - mobile phones will be jammed in the Hanoi building ​where the congress will take place and delegates, including those from Hanoi, are required to stay in designated accommodation - they will also refine the text of a resolution to be approved by the end of the congress, which is scheduled to wrap up ‍on January 25.\n\nA party draft released in ⁠October on the party's website suggests the final text will prioritise security and ambitious growth, targeting at least 10% annually over the next five years, from the 6.5% to 7.0% target that was missed in the first half of the decade.\n\nThe draft mentions security dozens of times and highlights ⁠the importance of diplomacy and defence in a \"more dangerous\" world. The party intends to increase its defence forces, especially in border areas, the draft text says.\n\nEnvironmental protection, which has been increasingly ‌debated recently in the heavily polluted country, has also gained prominence, according to Politburo member Nguyen Xuan Thang.",

    "description": "Near-weightless conditions can mutate genes and alter the physical structures of bacteria and phages, disrupting their normal interactions in ways that could help us treat drug-resistant infections.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nBacteria and the viruses that infect them, called phages, are locked in an evolutionary arms race. But that evolution follows a different trajectory when the battle takes place in microgravity, a study conducted aboard the International Space Station (ISS) reveals.\n\nAs bacteria and phages duke it out, bacteria evolve better defenses to survive while phages evolve new ways to penetrate those defenses. The new study, published Jan. 13 in the journal PLOS Biology, details how that skirmish unfolds in space and reveals insights that could help us design better drugs for antibiotic-resistant bacteria on Earth.\n\nIn the study, researchers compared populations of E. coli infected with a phage known as T7. One set of microbes was incubated aboard the ISS, while identical control groups were grown on Earth.\n\nThe analysis of the space-station samples revealed that microgravity fundamentally altered the speed and nature of phage infection.\n\nWhile the phages could still successfully infect and kill the bacteria in space, the process took longer than it did in the Earth samples. In an earlier study, the same researchers had hypothesized that infection cycles in microgravity would be slower because fluids don't mix as well in microgravity as they do in Earth's gravity.\n\n\"This new study validates our hypothesis and expectation,\" said lead study author Srivatsan Raman, an associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nOn Earth, the fluids bacteria and viruses exist within are constantly being stirred by gravity — warm water rises, cold water sinks, and heavier particles settle at the bottom. This keeps everything moving and bumping into each other.\n\nIn space, there is no stirring; everything just floats. So because the bacteria and phages weren't bumping into each other as often, phages had to adapt to a much slower pace of life and become more efficient at grabbing onto passing bacteria.\n\nExperts think understanding this alternative form of phage evolution could help them develop new phage therapies. These emerging treatments for infections use phages to kill bacteria or make the germs more vulnerable to traditional antibiotics.\n\n\"If we can work out what phages are doing on the genetic level in order to adapt to the microgravity environment, we can apply that knowledge to experiments with resistant bacteria,\" Nicol Caplin, a former astrobiologist at the European Space Agency who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. \"And this can be a positive step in the race to optimise antibiotics on Earth.\"\n\nWhole-genome sequencing revealed that both the bacteria and the phages on the ISS accumulated distinctive genetic mutations not observed in the samples on Earth. The space-based viruses accumulated specific mutations that boosted their ability to infect bacteria, as well as their ability to bind to bacterial receptors. Simultaneously, the E. coli developed mutations that protected against the phages' attacks — by tweaking their receptors, for instance — and enhanced their survival in microgravity.\n\nThen, the researchers used a technique called deep mutational scanning to examine the changes in the viruses' receptor-binding proteins. They found that the adaptations driven by the unique cosmic environment may have practical applications back home.\n\nWhen the phages were transported back to Earth and tested, the space-adapted changes in their receptor-binding protein resulted in increased activity against E. coli strains that commonly cause urinary tract infections. These strains are typically resistant to the T7 phages.\n\n\"It was a serendipitous finding,\" Raman said. \"We were not expecting that the [mutant] phages that we identified on the ISS would kill pathogens on Earth.\"\n\n—Antibiotic found hiding in plain sight could treat dangerous infections, early study finds\n\n—How fast can antibiotic resistance evolve?\n\n—Antibiotic resistance makes once-lifesaving drugs useless. Could we reverse it?\n\n\"These results show how space can help us improve the activity of phage therapies,\" said Charlie Mo, an assistant professor in the Department of Bacteriology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"However,\" Mo added, \"we do have to factor in the cost of sending phages into space or simulating microgravity on Earth to achieve these results.\"\n\nIn addition to helping fight infections in Earthbound patients, the research could help yield more effective phage therapies for use in microgravity, Mo suggested. \"This could be important for astronauts' health on long-term space missions — for example, missions to the moon or Mars, or prolonged ISS stays.\"",

    "fullText": "JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian rescuers on Sunday recovered a body in their search for 11 people aboard a plane that crashed while approaching a mountainous region on Sulawesi island.\n\nThe body of a man was retrieved from a ravine about 200 meters (656 feet) deep on the slope of Mount Bulusaraung, near scattered aircraft debris, said Muhammad Arif Anwar, who heads Makassar’s Search and Rescue Office.\n\nTeams also found additional wreckage, including parts of the aircraft frame and passenger seats, and visually identified what is believed to be the engine of the turboprop ATR 42-500 that crashed on Saturday afternoon, Anwar said.\n\nThe plane, operated by Indonesia Air Transport, was on its way from Yogyakarta on Indonesia's main island of Java to Makassar, the capital city of South Sulawesi province, when it vanished from radar shortly after being instructed by air traffic control to correct its approach alignment.\n\nThe plane was carrying eight crew members and three passengers from the Marine Affairs and Fisheries Ministry who were aboard as part of an airborne maritime surveillance mission.\n\nStrong winds, heavy fog and steep rugged terrain have slowed the search, said Maj. Gen. Bangun Nawoko, the South Sulawesi’s military commander. He said that visibility at the summit was about 5 meters (16 miles).\n\nRescuers spotted additional bodies lying along a steep cliff, but haven't been able to reach them yet, said Brig. Gen. Andre Clift Rumbayan, who leads the specialized search units.\n\nThe search was halted as darkness fell Sunday and was to resume on Monday morning.\n\nIndonesia relies heavily on air transport and ferries to connect its more than 17,000 islands. The Southeast Asian country has been plagued by transportation accidents in recent years, from plane and bus crashes to ferry sinkings.",

    "fullText": "Freiburg secured a hard-fought draw in Augsburg by scoring twice in the space of two minutes after starting the second-half with the hosts doing the same in five minutes. Julian Schuster is satisfied with the result after they suffered their first defeat of the year against RB Leipzig in midweek.\n\n“It’s frustrating that we went behind,” the Freiburg coach referred to their slow start after the break. “The reaction we showed with the fresh legs was very good, though. Then, we even scored a goal that was chalked off. Even if Augsburg created another chance, we can see the positives in the last half an hour.”\n\nIgor Matanovic, who scored Freiburg’s equalizer, saw his second goal chalked off due to the ball crossing the line in the buildup. “Both teams had so much space (to create chances). I think we would’ve had the chance to win if we played better in a couple of situations.”\n\nFreiburg will play two games at the Europa-Park in the space of four days as they host Köln after their final home game of the Europa League league phase stage against Maccabi Tel Aviv.",

He’s the only coach that has coached this long and does not have a tree. Guys are emotionally attached to him, not performance. A great coach, the measurement of greatness, it’s not based on personal experiences and relationships you have with them. It is purely on what you did as a coach. Did you get championships? Did you build disciples?”\n\nMORE: Exploring 5 wild Broncos QB options to replace Bo Nix\n\nHarrison wasn't done talking bad about his former coach.\n\n“So, a Hall of Fame should be making history for having the longest losing streak in playoff history?” Harrison wondered aloud.\n\nHarrison was crucial to Tomlin's Super Bowl.

    "fullText": "As Lexi Thompson steps away from the LPGA spotlight, the golf star is embracing a new chapter in her personal life. Turning heads off the course, Thompson recently celebrated her bachelorette party in style, offering fans a glimpse into her wedding preparations. The joyful milestone arrives amid her competitive hiatus, marking a moment of balance between career reflection and personal celebration as she prepares for the next phase of her life.\n\nLexi Thompson took to Instagram to share some moments from her bachelorette party.\n\n“So much fun at @moxiesusa for bachelorette celebrations,” captioned Thompson below a series of pictures from her bachelorette.\n\nThe LPGA Tour pro celebrated with her friends at the Moxies restaurant. Thompson is set to marry Max Provost in March 2026.\n\nBack in early 2025, the 30-year-old announced her engagement to Provost. According to the reports, Provost asked the all-important question to Thompson on New Year’s Day 2025, in Whistler, Canada. And much to his elation, the 1x major champion gave the nod, agreeing to be tied with Provost for life. While Max Provost is keeping his life very private, from his LinkedIn profile, we can see that he is a Clinical Sales Representative for Intuitive Surgical.\n\n“I work with physicians and surgeons to help with the adoption of daVinci robotics in surgery. I help enhance the lives of patients by offering and educating on a state-of-the-art minimally invasive surgical modality that leads to faster recovery, less complications, and a better overall quality of life,” his bio reads.\n\nAs of now, Thompson is semi-retired. Following her participation in the 2024 U.S. Women’s Open, Thompson declared that she will no longer participate in a full LPGA season from now on.\n\nThompson turned pro at just 15 years of age. She has, till now, clinched 15 professional titles, out of which 11 of her victories came in the LPGA Tour. Thus, when she announced a semi-retirement from her career, although fans were shocked, according to Thompson, the decision was exactly what she needed.\n\n“I want to have a family one day and just enjoy every experience of that and be there for every single moment. That’s the most important for me. I’ve only known golf as my life. So it’s nice to branch out and be able to enjoy other things,” she said in a statement after she announced her retirement in 2024.\n\nWith Thompson trying to soak in the essence of life, fans soon had their voices heard online.\n\nIn the Instagram post, Thompson shared how she has spent quality time with her friends. Witnessing the lavish celebration, one fan noted, “Well, that looks like fun, and you look gorgeous and so happy\n\n.” Another fan, too, echoed the same thoughts and wrote, “Looks like fun! Congratulations & enjoy the moment\n\nWith just weeks left for the D-Day to arrive, good wishes have already started pouring in for the LPGA golfer. One such comment read, “SOO Many congratulations\n\nLexi. Wonderful to see you happy\n\n”. Another fan chimed in, “Congratulations, Lexi.”\n\nAs Thompson had taken a break from the competitive realm by taking a semi-retirement, and fans would not be getting to see the star play in all the calendar events, one golf enthusiast mentioned, “Going to miss seeing you on the course this season.”\n\nThus, with things looking rosy for the 30-year-old, fans cannot wait to see her enjoy life to the fullest post her marriage.\n\nThe post Lexi Thompson Turns Heads at Her Bachelorette Party as Wedding Preps Begin Amid LPGA Hiatus appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

They visit the Hurricanes on Thursday before hosting Tampa Bay on Friday night.\n\n“As far as I know, he won't play tomorrow. Unless something drastically changed, I don't think he will,” coach Jeff Blashill said of Nazar. “So that would allow him another full practice at least and then see where we go from there.”\n\nBlashill also said Teuvo Teravainen won't play against the Jets because of an upper-body injury. The 31-year-old forward got hurt in the first period of last week's 4-1 loss to Edmonton.\n\nNazar, a first-round pick in the 2022 draft, has six goals and 15 assists in 33 games this season.

    "description": "Senegal beat Morocco to claim their second Afcon title despite walking off the pitch after a late penalty award which also sparked chaos in the stands.",
    "fullText": "Pape Gueye's extra-time goal was enough to seal a second Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) title for Senegal, after chaotic scenes at the end of normal time saw the West Africans walk off the pitch and Brahim Diaz miss a penalty for Morocco in the 24th minute of injury time.\n\nThe lengthy delay came after the spot kick was awarded via the intervention of the video assistant referee (VAR), sparking angry scenes on the touchline and in the crowd, with Senegal fans clashing with security after attempting to break on to the pitch.\n\nAfter waiting so long to take his penalty, Diaz was under immense pressure, having been handed the chance to end his country's 50-year wait to lift the Afcon trophy with essentially the final kick of the game, but his decision to chip the ball down the middle backfired horrendously as Edouard Mendy was able to stand his ground and collect in embarrassingly simple fashion.\n\nAfter 90 minutes which were largely devoid of obvious goalscoring opportunities, the unsavoury scenes at the end were a poor advert for African football, especially with Morocco talking up this tournament as a test event for co-hosting the 2030 Fifa World Cup.\n\nChances did come at both ends after Gueye's strike four minutes into extra time, but the closest Morocco came to an equaliser was when Nayef Aguerd powered a header against the bar from a corner.\n\nAnd as the rain poured down in Rabat, Morocco's dream of a first continental crown since 1976 was washed away in dramatic fashion.\n\n'An ambassador for African football' - Mane is Senegal's Afcon hero\n\nSenegal walk off in Afcon final over penalty award\n\nSenegal were understandably jubilant at the end, having somehow found a way to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, but the sight of celebrating players being separated from their supporters by massed ranks of police in riot gear said everything about the way this game finished.\n\nHaving won a first title by beating Egypt on penalties at the 2021 edition, many of the same players returned here for a second bite of the cherry, including talisman Sadio Mane, who has hinted heavily that this will be his last appearance at an Afcon.\n\nBut unlike in Cameroon, this time the Teranga Lions were up against the hosts and the fiery atmosphere inside the impressive Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium.\n\nA first-ever meeting between the two teams at a finals saw Morocco edge proceedings in the first half, but Senegal have the best openings.\n\nYassine Bounou made a good scrambling save at his far post to keep out Gueye's goalbound header from a corner, while the African goalkeeper of the year also denied Iliman Ndiaye with a trailing leg.\n\nThe start of the second half saw a fired up Morocco exert greater dominance, pinning back their opponents, but still struggling to create clear-cut chances.\n\nIn fact, the Atlas Lions got lucky at the start of injury time when Ismaila Sarr nodded the ball into the net after Abdoulaye Seck's initial header came back off the woodwork after a corner.\n\nHowever, referee Jean Jacques Ndala had already blown his whistle, awarding a very soft foul for contact between Seck and Morocco captain Achraf Hakimi.\n\nBut that was just the start of the drama, as what followed will inevitably be what this game is remembered for.\n\nWith eight minutes having originally been added on, Ndala was advised by VAR to check a tug by West Ham defender El Hadji Malick Diouf on Diaz from a corner, with the Congolese deciding to award the spot kick.\n\nWhat started out as fierce complaints by the Senegalese players quickly descended into chaos on the touchline as both benches emptied onto the pitch.\n\nHaving gone head-to-head with opposite number Walid Regragui, Senegal coach Pape Thiaw called his players down the tunnel, while West African fans, some wielding metal chairs, also attempted to fight their way on to the playing surface.\n\nFollowing a lengthy delay, with Mane the only Teranga Lions player who looked truly uncomfortable with the walk-off, everyone returned to the pitch and Diaz was finally able to take his penalty for what should have been a celebratory moment for his country.\n\nBut with history beckoning, the Real Madrid man tried to showboat with a Panenka and paid the price in a way which he is unlikely to ever forget.\n\nMorocco, Africa's top team in the world rankings, came into this tournament feeling like they had a date with destiny.\n\nFor more than a decade, King Mohammed VI has poured huge sums of money into the game, using it as a tool for societal and cultural change, a move which resulted in the Atlas Lions becoming the first African nation to reach a World Cup semi-final at Qatar 2022.\n\nBut this Afcon was supposed to be their crowing achievement, the moment to end a long trophy drought stretching back to 1976.\n\nInstead, they become just the fourth hosts to lose in a final - having seen the past 12 who have reach the showpiece end up as champions.\n\nThe moment which broke their hearts came from Villarreal man Gueye, a towering midfield presence who has been one of the tournament's standout players.\n\nHaving burst forward from just inside the Moroccan half, he shrugged off a tired-looking challenge from Hakimi just outside the box and smashed a left-foot rocket into the top right-hand corner, clipping the underside of the bar as it went in.\n\nMorocco did their best to fight back, with substitute Youssef En-Nesyri stooping to head just wide at the near post 10 minutes after Gueye's goal and Aguerd's header off the bar following in the second half of extra time.\n\nBut Senegal also had chances to extend their lead, with Paris St-Germain teenager Ibrahim Mbaye's slaloming run and shot blocked by a lunging Hakimi and Cherif Ndiaye denied by a brilliant double save from Bounou.\n\nAt the other end, Mendy was being bombarded with missiles thrown by fans behind his goal, with one invader making it onto the pitch next to the former Chelsea stopper before security managed to force him away.\n\nThe recriminations over the way in which this game ended will go on for some time - but Senegal are unlikely to care.\n\nIf this is to be Mane's final Afcon he has bowed out in style, and the sight of him being hoisted on to the shoulders of his team-mates, trophy in hand and having had the captain's armband thrust upon him, will hopefully last longer.",

    "description": "After the NFL regular season was spiced by debate over calls made or missed by the officials, it’s only natural for the playoffs to have such drama.",
    "fullText": "Even worse for the heartbroken Buffalo Bills as Ja’Quan McMillian ripped the football away from Brandin Cooks for the interception that gave the Denver Broncos new life in overtime of the Jan. 17 AFC divisional playoff game was the sight of back judge Scott Helverson instantly signaling a turnover.\n\nRather than a 39-yard completion that could have set up a potential game-winning field goal, the Bills saw victory snatched from their grasp in a hail of controversy.\n\nThe ruling from New York – where the NFL reviews all turnovers from its officiating command center at league headquarters – didn’t make it better for the Bills Mafia.\n\nAnd it will linger as another symbol of frustration for a franchise that has come up short again in its quest to get back to the Super Bowl.\n\n“It’s hard for me to understand why it was ruled the way it was ruled,” Bills coach Sean McDermott said during an emotional postgame news conference after the Broncos advanced to the AFC championship game with a 33-30 victory.\n\nSorry, Buffalo. It wouldn’t be the NFL without some sort of officiating controversy. After the dramatic regular season was spiced by several cases that inflamed debate over calls made or missed by the officials, it’s only natural for the playoffs to come wrapped with such drama.\n\nThe Bills – plus armchair quarterbacks, ex-players, informed analysts, internet influencers and probably others – maintained that Cooks should have been ruled down by contact after hauling in the rainbow throw from Josh Allen that traveled 55 yards in the air. Cooks and McMillian tumbled to the turf and rolled over with the nickel back emerging with the football.\n\nReferee Carl Cheffers explained that Cooks never had possession of the football as he crashed to the turf.\n\n“The defender is the one that completed the process of the catch, so the defender was awarded the ball,” Cheffers said in the Pro Football Writers Association (PFWA) pool report.\n\nMaybe so. Yet that hardly addresses the inconsistency that is often at the heart of debate concerning the calls or non-calls by NFL officials.\n\nHow many times have we seen a receiver barely touch the ground with a knee hitting the turf – as Cooks did – and getting credit for the catch?\n\nSure, there’s always a different perspective with freeze-frame video versus real-time eyesight. That’s part of what the officiating experts – in New York and on the field – undoubtedly have to process.\n\nIn any event, for Bills fans, the would-be catch by Cooks is their version of the “Dez Bryant caught it” controversy that dogged the Dallas Cowboys after the receiver’s apparent catch was ruled incomplete in an NFC divisional playoff loss at Green Bay in January 2015.\n\nOf course, McMillian wonders what the fuss is about.\n\n“I don’t really think he had complete control going down,” he said. “We were both fighting for the ball. I just made a play and basically took it out of his hands and came up with it.”\n\nAdding to Buffalo’s consternation were the two pass interference calls against Taron Johnson and Tre’Davious White, for 17 and 30 yards, respectively, that set up Wil Lutz’s chip-shot winning field goal.\n\nBlame the refs? Cheffers’ crew couldn’t be blamed for the DPI calls – Johnson pulled on Courtland Sutton’s arm as Bo Nix’s pass arrived. White hit intended target Marvin Mims, Jr. early – even in a game where it appeared the officials were not necessarily calling it tight.\n\nStill, you may never convince the Bills – stung in last year’s playoff by a questionable spot on an Allen run in crunch time of the AFC title game loss a Kansas City – that McMillian’s interception should have stood.\n\nMcDermott was unable to challenge the ruling for two reasons. All turnovers and scoring plays are automatically reviewed in New York at any point in the game. Besides, it was overtime, when coaches are unable to challenge a play as all replay reviews are initiated in New York.\n\nStill, credit McDermott for his next-best, last-gasp option: He called a timeout and requested a quick chat with Cheffers, who told him the turnover was confirmed in New York.\n\n“It was a rather rapid unfolding of the review, if there was a review, and so I called a timeout to try to slow it down,” McDermott said. “It would seem logical to me and make a lot of sense that the head official would walk over and want to go and take a look at it. Just to make sure that everybody from here who is in the stadium, to there (in New York) are on the same page. That’s too big of a play, in my estimation, too big of a play in a play that decided the game, potentially … to not even slow it down. That’s why I had to call the timeout.”\n\nThe controversy, nonetheless, will live on. Scrutiny on officials will likely intensify during the offseason as the NFL engages in negotiations with the union for officials as the expiration of their labor pact looms.\n\nSean Payton gets it. The Broncos coach had his own moment of officiating controversy in a high-stakes game during his tenure with the New Orleans Saints. A non-call of pass interference near the goal line stung New Orleans during an overtime loss to the Los Angeles Rams during the 2018 NFC Championship Game at the Superdome.\n\nHad the Broncos not survived on Sunday, Payton might have some sort of flashback – and surely been livid about an apparent missed call in overtime. Early on Buffalo’s final possession, it appeared that a holding call was missed as Allen threw from his end zone. A flag would have resulted in a safety.\n\n“A phenomenal play by ‘J-Mac,’” Payton said of McMillian’s interception. “But it should’ve ended really with a safety, which would’ve been the first in the history of football.”\n\nA playoff game ending on a penalty would have surely ignited some controversy.\n\nHey, there’s always next weekend.\n\nContact Jarrett Bell at jbell@usatoday.com or follow on X: @JarrettBell\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Bills vs Broncos interception controversy explained",

    "fullText": "Senegal's Africa Cup of Nations final match-winner Pape Gueye said his team had been fuelled by a sense of injustice after a controversial penalty award for Morocco which led to ugly scenes had almost cost them the title.\n\nThe match at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat was still goalless deep in injury time at the end of normal time when Morocco were awarded a spot-kick following a VAR check for a challenge on Brahim Diaz.\n\nAlready furious at having a goal disallowed at the other end for a soft-looking foul minutes earlier, Senegal reacted angrily to the decision and some of their players walked off the pitch in disgust.\n\nMeanwhile trouble broke out in the stands as some Senegalese fans tried to enter the field of play and became involved in fighting with security personnel.\n\nThe game was held up for almost 20 minutes before Diaz could take the penalty, and his weak kick was saved by Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.\n\nGueye then went on to score a brilliant goal in the fourth minute of extra time to give his team a 1-0 win and hand them the trophy.\n\n\"We had a feeling of injustice. Just before the penalty we thought we should have had a goal and the referee didn't go to VAR,\" said Villarreal midfielder Gueye, who added that Sadio Mane had urged the team to come back onto the pitch for the penalty.\n\n\"Sadio told us to come back on and we remobilised. Edouard then made the save, we stayed focused, got the goal and won the game.\"\n\nSenegal coach Pape Thiaw said he had told his team to walk off in the first place because they disagreed with the penalty decision, but he admitted that he should not have done so.\n\n\"After thinking about it, I realised that I shouldn't have asked them to go off. I apologise for that,\" Thiaw told French broadcaster beIN Sports.\n\n\"Sometimes you can react in the heat of the moment. Before that we scored a goal that was not given. But now we accept that referees do make mistakes and we apologise.\"\n\nIt was Senegal's second Cup of Nations title, four years after they claimed their first in Cameroon with a penalty shoot-out win in the final against Egypt.\n\nThe Lions of Teranga have also twice been runners-up, and remarkably Gueye's goal was the first Senegal have ever scored in four AFCON final appearances in total.\n\n\"We are very happy with the victory tonight,\" said Gueye, who pointed out that three Senegal players -- including regular starting right-back Krepin Diatta and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Pape Matar Sarr -- had been last-minute withdrawals from the final.\n\n\"We feel pride. We wanted to win tonight. We all saw what happened at the end of the match but we took the decision to come back onto the pitch and give everything, which we did.\"",

    "fullText": "Two English women’s teams became the first to pass £20million in annual revenues last season, according to the latest iteration of Deloitte’s Football Money League report.\n\nThe annual undertaking ranks football clubs worldwide by revenue, based on figures from the most recently completed season. The 2026 version, incorporating financials from 2024-25, is the fourth time Deloitte has included a women’s team ranking in a report that is now into its 29th year of publication.\n\nArsenal, who won the Champions League in May, topped the women’s listing for the first time, with revenues of £21.5m (€25.6m). Domestic rivals Chelsea trailed just behind (£21.3m), with the London clubs leaping above Barcelona Femeni (£18.5m), who led the way in 2023-24.\n\nThe report reflects continued revenue growth in women’s football, but there are caveats. For one, the United States, home to a slew of valuable women’s teams, is excluded. A note from Deloitte detailed the consultancy firm’s inability to obtain relevant information from clubs in the U.S., as well as other key women’s football markets, such as Australia and Sweden.\n\nAlso worth mentioning — and it applies to the men’s version of the report, too, which will be published later this week — is that an appearance on Deloitte’s list does not equate to financial stability. High revenues don’t necessarily equal profits. The report’s limited focus on turnover, alongside the fact that most clubs are yet to disclose last season’s accounts, means we don’t know what the world’s most prominent women’s teams spent on wages and the likes.\n\nChelsea had the third-highest revenues in 2023-24 at £11.5m, yet turned those into a deficit of £8.4m, a loss margin of 73 per cent. It is not yet known which women’s teams ran tight ships last season.\n\nEven allowing for those limitations, the report shows a clear driving force behind growing revenues in the women’s game: commercial income.\n\nOf the £132.2m collectively generated by the 15 highest-earning clubs in 2024-25, £95.8m came from commercial revenue streams. At 72 per cent of overall income, commercial earnings were more than double matchday and broadcast revenues combined. Eleven of the 12 clubs to disclose their splits of revenue and appear in this and last year’s lists enjoyed improved commercial income.\n\nThe largest growth, and the largest commercial income in women’s football, arrived at Chelsea, who more than doubled the revenue stream to £16m. That followed the internal sale of Chelsea Women to another business within the BlueCo sphere.\n\nThe transaction helped Chelsea’s men’s team comply with Premier League profitability and sustainability rules, a factor which was widely seen as the primary motive. Yet at the time of the reorganisation in May 2024, Chelsea said they hoped to “harness the full potential of the opportunity for women’s football” and, based on these latest figures, there are signs of them doing that.\n\nPer Deloitte’s report, that £16m commercial revenue was “driven by both attributions from club-wide sponsorship deals, as well as exclusive partnerships with major brands”. The latter was in evidence in July 2024 when Three, the telecommunications company, became the club’s first women’s-only principal partner, and other exclusive sponsorships have followed. D.Louise became the club’s first official jewellery partner in May 2025, followed four months later by Here We Flo, a period care brand.\n\nArsenal, too, boasted big commercial revenue last year, albeit there are questions around the origin of some of that amount. Per previous accounts for Arsenal Women, revenue includes ‘group income’, a figure which includes a support fee paid from the men’s team to the women’s to cover costs incurred. The Athletic does not have the 2024-25 accounts yet, but since the arrangement was introduced in June 2019, Arsenal Women have basically broken even every year, in part because the ‘revenue’ provided by the wider group is used.\n\nThat support fee is included in Deloitte’s commercial income figure, but it is unclear how much it comprised last season or previously. Per the basis of preparation note in the report, Deloitte advises the group income amount within Arsenal’s £13.6m commercial revenue “includes, among other components, revenue attributable to the women’s club from full club-wide commercial agreements, and revenue contributions from the men’s club”.\n\nAs with the men’s team, Emirates are Arsenal Women’s front-of-shirt sponsor and Adidas manufacture the kit. Those and other lead partners such as Sobha Realty and Visit Rwanda presumably make up the bulk of the commercial figure, but with no way of splitting the sum into revenue from external sources and that support fee, it is unclear how big Arsenal’s true commercial earnings are — or whether removing the support fee would see them fall from the top of the overall revenue list.\n\nTaken at face value, the commercial incomes of Chelsea and Arsenal’s women’s teams were higher than Sheffield United and Luton Town managed in the Premier League in 2023-24. Moreover, Arsenal’s £13.6m is higher than the most recent commercial income than 19 men’s EFL Championship clubs; for Chelsea, their £16m was higher than 21 clubs from the men’s second tier.\n\nIf there are question marks about their commercial figure, where Arsenal undoubtedly led the was in matchday income, with the £5.9m they earned from the gate more than six men’s EFL Championship clubs, per most recently available figures. It was close to double the second-highest women’s matchday income figure last season (Barcelona: £3.3m), and spoke to Arsenal’s using data analytics to appeal to attendees.\n\nNine of 11 Women’s Super League (WSL) home games were played at the Emirates Stadium, drawing average crowds of more than 34,000 and a high of 56,748 for the North London derby with Spurs last February. All 11 of Arsenal’s home league games will be played at the Emirates in 2025-26.\n\nGrowth at the gate was far from uniform, though, and after a record-breaking year of attendances in 2023-24, five WSL teams saw average gates drop. Nowhere was that more evident than at Manchester United, where a fall in attendances of a third led to a similar proportionate reduction in gate receipts.\n\nMatchday growth as a whole across the sampled clubs (excluding Paris Saint-Germain, who didn’t provide a split of revenues for last year’s edition) was just £3m, albeit that still represented a 19 per cent rise given the lowly starting point. The increase was, however, largely driven by a couple of outliers, principally Arsenal and Bayern Munich.\n\nGrowth was even more anaemic when it came to broadcast income, which stagnated as existing TV deals continued and performance-based payments offset between clubs. Lowly money from broadcast income highlights a stark juxtaposition between the women’s and men’s forms of the game. Where in the latter, hefty TV rights drove a surge in incomes and a focus on commercial revenues came later, for women’s teams, it is sponsorship deals and partnerships doing the heavy lifting.\n\nWSL teams will benefit from a new TV deal that began this season, but for the highest earners, commercial deals will remain the largest revenue driver.\n\nIn terms of league of origin, the women’s game has quickly come to mirror the men’s: the richest clubs primarily derive from England. Eight of the top 15 are from the WSL, the same number as in 2023-24.\n\nMade clear from this latest release of figures is the gulf between those at the top of women’s football and the rest. Arsenal and Chelsea surpass £20m, Barcelona are not too far off, then there is a big gap to the two Manchester clubs and Real Madrid, each of whom just topped £10m. Beyond them, the fall-off is even greater.\n\nThe revenue of women’s football’s top earners was double that of the fifth-highest earning club, and 4.8 times that of the 10th team on Deloitte’s list, Tottenham Hotspur. That dispersion of revenue has grown since 2023-24, when the highest earner generated 3.9 times the 10th-placed side.\n\nRevenue dispersion: high earner v 10th\n\nSuch disparity might sound familiar to the men’s form, but while the differences in monetary terms are far smaller, the dispersion as a multiple is higher in the women’s game. When Arsenal Women’s revenue was 4.8 times higher than Spurs last season, the huge earnings of Real Madrid in the men’s game were only 1.9 times higher than 10th-placed Chelsea in 2023-24. We will have to wait until later this week to see the men’s dispersion level for last season.\n\nRevenues in women’s football are plainly growing, and it should not be forgotten that the sport remains in almost a start-up stage. Jennifer Haskel of Deloitte’s Sport Business Group advises “the shift from the start-up phase to the established phase requires consistent time, investment and effort to develop the foundations in the right manner”.\n\nThat much is clear, and this report highlights the obvious need for women’s teams to improve matchday and broadcast incomes. Women’s teams are capitalising effectively on commercial markets men’s teams have historically not appealed to — generating more money from viewership, in person and on the sofa, is now an obvious target area.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nArsenal, Chelsea, NWSL, Sports Business, Women's Soccer\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "The AFC’s divisional round matchup between the Houston Texans and New England Patriots will likely go down as the most brutal game of this year’s playoffs. By the time each team had reached their locker room for the halftime break, there had already been a total of six turnovers committed, and neither C.J. Stroud nor Drake Maye were able to find much comfort in the pocket.\n\nNew England’s sophomore sensation endured five sacks and fumbled twice throughout the first three quarters of play, but in the end, he was still able to find Kayshon Boutte for a game-clinching 32-yard touchdown pass at the top of the fourth. Maye’s ability to overcome adversity on a routine basis has seen him draw several comparisons to his predecessor, Tom Brady, throughout the past several months.\n\nAccording to the team’s owner, Robert Kraft, there are “a lot of similarities” between the two of them that extend well beyond the football field. “They both have a sense of humility, and they are understated,” Kraft explained during his pregame appearance with NFL ESPN.\n\n“I saw Drake last year, when we had that horrible record, he did something that Tommy did in the locker room in the early years. He used to go around to every offensive lineman, even after we had a bad loss, and make, in a genuine way, make them feel he really respected what they did. Drake is such an understated, humble, young man. He comes from a great family. He married his seventh-grade sweetheart.”\n\nIn the eyes of Kraft, the best way to describe the former Tar Heel is by using the words “genuine” and “real.” If you were to ask the oddsmakers out in Las Vegas, however, they’d likely tell you that the term “Most Valuable Player” is more applicable.\n\nHaving led the league in completion percentage, yards gained per pass attempt, and passer rating, the 23-year-old closed the 2025 regular season as a slight underdog to Matthew Stafford for the regular season MVP award, but now that he’s headed to the AFC Championship, the only thing that’s on his mind right now is extending the dynasty that Brady built.\n\nFollowing their 28-16 win over the Texans, the Patriots saw their odds of winning the Super Bowl improve to +250, making them the second-largest favorite to win it all this year. The Seattle Seahawks continue to be the odds-on favorite, but seeing as the Denver Broncos will be without their QB1, Bo Nix, for next week’s match-up, New England figures to have the easiest remaining path to the title game.\n\nThat’s right, believe it or not, the Patriots are back in the conference championship for the first time since 2018. It won’t seem fair to all of the other fan bases out there, but it’s times like these where we are reminded that the gridiron doesn’t care about your feelings, and neither does Drake Maye.\n\nNew England will return to play on January 25th at Empower Field at Mile High on January 25th at 3:00 pm EST.\n\nThe post “He Married His Seventh-Grade Sweetheart”: Robert Kraft Finds ‘A Lot’ Of Similarities Between Drake Maye and Tom Brady appeared first on The SportsRush.",

An emotional Kyren Wilson is cutting a dejected and disconsolate figure in the dark and grey bowels of the York Barbican.\n\nNot only has he had family health issues to contend with, but a difficult campaign has been compounded by being forced to change the cue that he used to win the world title in 2024 - after it was damaged in a \"freak accident\".\n\nThe Englishman even says he was close to having a \"mental breakdown\" during his last-32 defeat by Elliot Slessor at the UK Championship - just last month.\n\nThen fast forward just six weeks to images of Wilson pouring out of Alexandra Palace on Sunday, as he lifted the Paul Hunter Trophy and celebrated his maiden Masters triumph with his family.\n\n\"It's amazing. Father Christmas was very kind to me,\" said Wilson, who auctioned off his beloved old cue for a children's cancer charity, raising £5,250.\n\n\"It was a complete freak accident, what happened to my cue, so there are no bad feelings there but it is so important to have something you can trust out there.\"\n\nArmed with a suitable replacement, Wilson, 34, made it third time lucky when he became the 26th winner of the Masters, having twice previously been defeated in the final.\n\nHis route to glory and a second Triple Crown title took him past Si Jiahui, Neil Robertson, Wu Yize and finally four-time world champion John Higgins, who is widely regarded as one of the game's greatest players.\n\n\"I'll be honest I thought at the UK Championship I was gone, I honestly didn't know if I was ever going to be back in the winners' enclosure,\" Wilson added.\n\n\"I have such a supportive family and I promised my mum she was going to have that bit of crystal [Masters trophy] on her dining room table.\n\n\"People don't see what happens behind closed doors but I was in a bad way at the UK - really, really suffering.\n\n\"To pick up a new cue and, after one month, to go and win the second biggest major is an incredible achievement.\"\n\nWilson defeats Higgins to claim first Masters title\n\nMasters results and previous winners",

This stretch is going to be absolutely brutal, with the team’s games coming against Maryland, Ohio State, USC and UCLA. How they split these games could end up being the difference between Iowa hosting and not for the NCAA Tournament, so at least 2 wins here would be ideal, making tonight’s game one of the most important to win.\n\nIt will be challenging though, as Michigan State’s only loss was a stunner, losing to Wisconsin on the road in early December. The team always manages to play Iowa hard, and tonight should be no exception. Let’s hope the home court advantage helps for the Hawkeyes. They’ll need strong performances once again from Hannah Stuelke, Ava Heiden, and Chit-Chat Wright to have their best shot at the win.\n\nIt will be interesting as well to see how freshman Addie Deal follows up her career-high 18 point performance against Oregon on Thursday night. If she can consistently score in what is sure to now be an expanded role, she adds another dimension to this Iowa squad that has, at times, struggled with shot creation.\n\nEmely Rodriguez is once again out for Iowa.\n\nShould be a great game.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New England Patriots punched their ticket to the AFC Championship on Sunday, January 18, with a hard-fought 28-16 victory over the Houston Texans. In a game defined by a relentless Foxborough snowstorm, Mike Vrabel’s squad overcame a turnover-heavy first half to secure the franchise's first conference title berth since 2019.\n\nThe matchup lived up to its billing as a defensive slugfest. While the Texans’ top-ranked unit made life difficult for Drake Maye, forcing him into four fumbles, the Patriots’ defense proved even more opportunistic. New England feasted on a record-tying four interceptions from C.J. Stroud, including a crucial Marcus Jones pick-six that swung the momentum for good. Despite the sloppy conditions, Maye’s three touchdown passes provided the necessary spark to push the Patriots past a Houston team that had dominated the Wild Card round.\n\nWith the win, the Patriots now look ahead to a high-stakes trip to higher altitudes next Sunday, January 25. Now, a new generation takes the stage as the Patriots aim to rewrite history and claim the all-time postseason wins record for themselves.\n\nHere is more on who the Patriots play next in the 2026 NFL playoffs.\n\nNFL divisional round picks, predictions\n\nRanking eight teams remaining in 2026 NFL playoffs\n\nNFL divisional round picks against the spread\n\nWith the win, the Patriots move on to the AFC Championship, facing the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Broncos squeaked past the Buffalo Bills and Josh Allen, automatically getting home-field advantage for the AFC Championship Game. Mile High is certainly no easy place to play, and Denver earned the right to host by clinching the No. 1 overall seed. Though Denver suffered a brutal blow when starting quarterback Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury.\n\nThe matchup carries heavy foreshadowing. The last time these two storied franchises met in the AFC Championship was exactly a decade ago in January 2016. That legendary \"Mile High\" battle served as the final postseason chapter of the Tom Brady vs. Peyton Manning rivalry — a game the Broncos won 20-18 on their way to a Super Bowl title.\n\nThis time around, with a new quarterback at the helm, New England is searching for revenge.",

The rapper has posted her hilarious, expletive-filled celebrations to Diggs' touchdowns on social media amidst the news that the pair welcomed their first child together in November.\n\nAnd now, Cardi B has gone through yet another rite of passage for sports fans celebrating their team's big win: dunking on analysts that predicted incorrectly.\n\nOn Sunday, the Patriots bested the Houston Texans 28-16 in a game that was basically over at the half thanks to C.J. Stroud's four interceptions. The loss was quite a stunning one for Texans supporters and especially for analysts that predicted Houston to come out on top. ESPN's NFL Live crew, for example, all picked the Texans in an incredibly amusing segment on the show this week.\n\nAs expected, the picks backfired tremendously and the Patriots cruised to the AFC Championship. However for the final blow, right after the clock hit zero, Cardi B swooped in to dunk on the NFL Live crew's disastrously incorrect predictions for Sunday's game with a short — but sweet — video response.\n\nTHEY DIDN’T BELIEVE IN US !!! I LIKE US!!!!! WE ALL WE GOT!!!!! WE ALL WE NEED !!!! #Patsnation https://t.co/pufQTNTIIw pic.twitter.com/GLa7dQy9Jr\n\n— Cardi B (@iamcardib) January 18, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Cardi B clapped back at NFL Live’s incorrect Patriots prediction",

    "description": "Trade talk is heating up in the PWHL, and the Vancouver Goldeneyes sound like they're involved.",
    "fullText": "The PWHL season is nearing the midway point and what has become abundantly clear is that teams falling behind are looking to make moves.\n\nThe only trade to date in this PWHL campaign came on the eve of the regular season when the Vancouver Goldeneyes sent Denisa Krisova to Minnesota in exchange for Anna Segedi.\n\nThere were a trio of trades on PWHL Draft day as well with New York swapping players with Toronto and Montreal, and Toronto and Vancouver also making a deal.\n\nAs the league standings continue to take shape, familiar trade partners could be in the mix again.\n\nVancouver came out of the expansion process with a roster that looked completely stacked with talent. What’s transpired since has been a run of underwhelming performances for the Goldeneyes, and the belief that despite a wealth of talent on their team, the mix isn’t working.\n\nWith Nina Jobst-Smith returning, followed by the return of Sarah Nurse, both coming back from injuries, the Vancouver Goldeneyes have experienced a influx to their roster.\n\nVancouver however, also has a group of players vastly underperforming from previous seasons who have seen their ice time on the decline as well. It's a long list for the Goldeneyes that could involve Brooke McQuigge, Michela Cava, Emma Greco, Izzy Daniel, and others.\n\nGeneral manager Cara Gardner Morey has been active in her early stages as a general manager making multiple deals, and another sounds like it's in the works.\n\nVancouver is certainly in the mix for an imminent trade.\n\nEveryone in the PWHL is open for business right now. The Ottawa Charge are believed to remain active on the trade market as they've been since the league was founded. General manager Mike Hirshfeld has made bold moves before such as a deal bringing in Jocelyne Larocque.\n\nOne area of need for the Charge remains their blueline where the Charge lack depth. With the loss of Shiann Darkangelo and Tereza Vanisova in the offseason however, secondary scoring in Ottawa has also been a concern. It's an issue that's been magnified by the early season struggles of Emily Clark, Katerina Mrazova, and Gabbie Hughes, as well as the transition time it's taking Anna Shokhina and Fanuza Kadirova to acclimatize to North America.\n\nThe Toronto Sceptres are another team who could be involved in a deal in the near future as the Sceptres continue to struggle to find chemistry both up front and on the blueline. Gina Kingsbury has pulled off multiple blockbuster deals including sending Larocque to Ottawa for Hayley Scamurra and Savannah Harmon, and the deal that brought Ella Shelton to Toronto at the draft. Kingsbury also has history with Vancouver making a draft day deal sending Kristen Campbell out west.",

Kiki Smith added 15 points, while Avery Gordon finished with 10 points and six rebounds.\n\nFor USC, Dunn delivered a standout performance with 29 points and five rebounds.

    "fullText": "To begin the season, most Boston Celtics fans assumed Anfernee Simons would be used as a trade chip on or near the Feb. 5 NBA trade deadline. Simons joined Boston as part of the deal that sent Jrue Holiday to the Portland Trail Blazers. The talented scorer is in the final year of his current contract and will become an unrestricted free agent in the summer.\n\nHowever, as the season has worn on, Simons has become a key member of the Celtics' rotation. He's grown into his role as the team's sixth man and currently ranks third in the NBA for total points off the bench. Due to his consistent impact, it's looking increasingly unlikely that Stevens parts with Simons before the trade deadline, and potentially looks to re-sign him during the summer.\n\nThe problem is, if Simons isn't part of a trade, Boston's chances of landing a high-level difference-maker will take a considerable hit. That issue only grows if you expect Sam Hauser to also be off limits. With all that in mind, Jack Simone and Sam LaFrance recently discussed the tough decisions Brad Stevens is facing in the coming weeks during an episode of the \"How 'Bout Them Celtics\" podcast.\n\nYou can watch the full podcast episode by clicking on the embedded video above.\n\nWatch or listen to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSpotify: https://bit.ly/40JRevf\n\nApple: https://apple.co/45sAUBG\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf\n\nThis article originally appeared on Celtics Wire: The Celtics face a trade deadline dilemma",

This season was supposed to be a gap year; however, Joe Mazzulla's coaching style has seen Boston emerge as a genuine contender in a wide-open Eastern Conference. Therefore, there are some sections of the fanbase that would like to see the Celtics become buyers before Feb. 5.\n\nThe Celtics need some additional talent at the center position, or someone who can play both the four and the five. Of course, Mazzulla must also prepare for the eventual return of Jayson Tatum, whether that be this season or next. Tatum is currently sidelined due to an Achilles tendon injury.\n\nDuring a recent episode of the \"Hardwood Knocks\" podcast, hosts Dan Favale and Bleacher Report's Grant Hughes discussed the impending trade deadline and what we can expect to see from the Celtics.

On a video game live stream, a person who claimed to be McGregor and sounded like the Irishman said because of the UFC's new broadcast deal with Paramount+, which eliminated the traditional pay-per-view model, his contract is, in essence, void and needs to be reworked.\n\nThat, the purported McGregor said, will take place in February.\n\nConor McGregor said he has to negotiate a new contract with the UFC next month 👀\n\n“My contract is essentially void right now.” pic.twitter.com/c7wVzFEkIG\n\n— Happy Punch (@HappyPunch) January 18, 2026\n\nIn July, it will be five years since McGregor (22-6 MMA, 10-4 UFC) last fought. He broke his leg in a second straight loss to Dustin Poirier at UFC 264. He coached Season 31 of \"The Ultimate Fighter\" opposite Michael Chandler (23-10 MMA, 2-5 UFC) and was supposed to fight him, but that never has come to fruition despite Chandler desperately pining for it, and McGregor consistently teasing it. UFC CEO Dana White recently took it off the table nearly entirely.\n\nSunday, the former UFC fighter continued his years-long spiral with a lengthy proclamation that he once again has seen the light – this time thanks to a hallucinogenic treatment in Mexico.\n\nThis past November, McGregor said he saw his own death, when it was going to happen, and how it would impact the four children he has with Dee Devlin, whom he recently married after years together. Then, he said, Jesus descended from heaven and put a crown on his head to save him during a hallucinogenic treatment in Mexico..\n\n\"To God, I am yours,\" McGregor posted on social media. \"Thank you for bestowing upon me this incredible blessing that I take with great care and absolute seriousness! I live my life per your word and nothing more.\"\n\nLast year, McGregor dropped out of a bid to become the next president of Ireland. He couldn't get support to even get his name on the ballot, so he wasn't actually in the race. McGregor has said he aspires to political office in the near future and has taken up a nationalistic right-wing rallying cry similar to Donald Trump in that pursuit. Like Trump, McGregor has multiple sexual assault accusations against him, and like Trump, a ruling against him for one, too.\n\nMcGregor was found liable for the 2018 sexual assault of Nikita Hand in a Dublin hotel. Then McGregor lost his appeal to have the decision reversed. After that, McGregor made a plea to his countrywomen and countrymen to stand with him in the wake of the mountain of civil and criminal charges against him over the years, and the civil rape and sexual assault trial that came home to roost. A poll found that just 7 percent of people said they would vote for McGregor to be president of Ireland.\n\nMcGregor also is part-owner of the BKFC and his appearances at those events are regular.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Conor McGregor purportedly says UFC contract void in Paramount era",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are one victory away from the Super Bowl following Sunday’s 28-16 win over the Houston Texans.\n\nNew England advanced to the AFC Championship Game in a sloppy, turnover-filled triumph over Houston. Following consecutive home wins, the Patriots will travel to Denver to face the Broncos for the conference title.\n\nAfter New England’s victory, the NFL announced the details for next weekend’s matchup. The Patriots will play the Broncos on Sunday, Jan. 25, at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nCBS will televise the AFC Championship Game, and viewers can also stream it on Paramount+.\n\nThe Patriots finished the regular season third in total offense, but their defense has carried them to double-digit playoff wins. They first sacked Justin Herbert six times in a 16-3 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers before locking down the Texans in the AFC Divisional Round.\n\nHouston averaged just 3.3 yards per play, gaining a mere 48 rushing yards on 22 carries. Making matters worse, C.J. Stroud threw four interceptions — one returned for a touchdown — and lost a fumble.\n\nThe Patriots will look to improve to 9-0 on the road when playing the Broncos, who survived a 33-30 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills. But the AFC West champions suffered a huge loss in the process, as quarterback Bo Nix broke his ankle at the end of the game.\n\nThat places former Patriots reserve Jarrett Stidham in line to make his fifth career start.

    "fullText": "Rockets' Kevin Durant set to move within one spot of Michael Jordan on all-time points list originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nKevin Durant is without a doubt one of the all-time greats, and he's starting to solidify that even more as he nears the end of his career.\n\nDurant is currently 7th on the all-time points list, and he's set to move up to 6th very soon.\n\nThat would mean that he's only one spot away from Michael Jordan, who sits 5th all-time in points.\n\nEntering Sunday night, Kevin Durant will only need 17 points to pass Dirk Nowitzki on the NBA's all-time points list, which would move Durant to #6 on the list.\n\nThat would mean Michael Jordan is next up to pass on the list. Jordan scored 32,292 points in his career and is 5th all-time on the points list.\n\nMORE: LeBron James has officially played against 1/3 of players in NBA history\n\nJordan trails only LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone and Kobe Bryant in this all-time stat.\n\nWith Durant averaging about 26 points this season, it would take him about 25-35 games, roughly, to pass Jordan on the list.\n\nAs long as Durant stays healthy, it should happen before the season ends, as he's still a reliable scorer night in and night out.\n\nHe's still a ways away from passing the likes of Kobe Bryant (4th all-time) after he passes Jordan on the list, but for now, he has his eyes set on passing one of the GOATs.\n\nSteph Curry is approaching an unbreakable three-point career milestone that you can't even fathom\n\nNBA insider hints at potential trade deadline swap between Yves Missi and former No. 6 pick/18 PPG scorer\n\nPistons showing serious interest in former No. 4 pick/DPOY\n\nGrizzlies asking price in potential Ja Morant-Bucks trade revealed by NBA insider\n\nBucks should trade for former No. 1 pick instead of Ja Morant, analyst suggests\n\nWhy Giannis Antetokounmpo is holding up the entire NBA trade market",

    "fullText": "The Australian Open is now underway, with plenty of upsets having already taken place in Melbourne.\n\nOn the ATP Tour, 20th seed Flavio Cobolli lost in the first round to Arthur Fery, who emerged through qualifying.\n\nAmerican hopeful Sebastian Korda also lost his first match, as did seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams on the WTA Tour.\n\nDefending champion Jannik Sinner will soon take on Hugo Gaston, while Madison Keys begins her title defence against Oleksandra Oliynykova.\n\nKeys’ chances of defending her title have now been discussed by former player Rennae Stubbs, who said on her podcast: “I don’t think she’s going to defend.\n\n“And the reason I say that, it’s not because she’s not capable, she’s arguably the best hitter of the ball in women’s tennis.\n\n“But she hasn’t had the same lead-up. She won Adelaide playing probably the best tennis of her life, came in here super confident.\n\n“Whereas she’s had a lot of injuries, she’s had an iteration to her service motion again. So I just think that she just doesn’t quite have the same confidence she had last year.\n\n“So I just don’t see her defending her title this year. I see Amanda [Anisimova] being the one who gets through there.”\n\nKeys lifted the trophy in Adelaide before the 2025 Australian Open, where she claimed her maiden Grand Slam title.\n\nAt this year’s Adelaide International, the American beat Tereza Valentova before losing her quarterfinal to Victoria Mboko.\n\nAnother player Stubbs was tasked with discussing was Naomi Osaka, who like Keys is a former Australian Open champion.\n\nShe has, however, won the Grand Slam twice and is a four-time Grand Slam champion in total, while she is also a former world number one.\n\nBut Stubbs said of Osaka: “Look, I just think again, she just doesn’t have the tennis under her belt that she needs coming in here.\n\n“Can she beat anyone on any given day? Absolutely. Naomi Osaka is a four-time champion of a major title.\n\n“She knows how to win them. But everyone is so good now, and she has to get more tennis under her belt.\n\n“I just don’t think she’s quite there enough to beat an Iga Swiatek or an [Elena] Rybakina or any of these players. But then again, who knows? We know she’s capable. She has the tools, that’s for sure.”\n\nOsaka, who warmed up for the Australian Open by playing for Japan at the United Cup, meets Antonia Ruzic in round one in Melbourne.",

    "description": "Senegal forward Sadio Mane is the hero once again, but this time for unexpected reasons as his side leaves the pitch during the chaotic Afcon final win over Morocco.",
    "fullText": "Sadio Mane was the hero for Senegal once again, but not for the reasons you would expect.\n\nThe former Liverpool and Bayern Munich forward claimed his second Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) crown on Sunday, with the Teranga Lions beating host nation Morocco in a final filled with controversy.\n\nIn stoppage time, Senegal head coach Pape Thiaw tried to usher his team off the field after Morocco were awarded a penalty in the 98th minute when defender El Hadji Malick Diouf brought down Brahim Diaz.\n\nWith the Senegal players back in the changing rooms, Mane was pictured entering and then ushering them back out on to the pitch, with the help of goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.\n\nRoughly 16 minutes after the spot-kick was awarded, Diaz's Panenka penalty was easily caught by Mendy in a nightmare moment for one of the stars of the tournament.\n\nAt 0-0 the game went to extra time. Pape Gueye rocketed in a winner and sealed a dramatic title.\n\nMane, who has said this will be his last Afcon, goes out as a leader - having been presented with the captain's armband by his team-mates before the trophy was lifted.\n\nHe told African media: \"Yes, it was I who convinced the team to return to the field.\n\n\"The players and the coach had decided to withdraw, and I didn't understand that decision, but finally, I told everyone to return immediately and to play no matter the cost.\"\n\nFormer Nigeria forward Daniel Amokachi told BBC World Service: \"Mane went the extra mile to get his team back and it has paid off.\n\n\"What an ambassador for football he is. We know the kind of person he is off the pitch and he knows what football is all about.\"\n\nFormer Morocco international Hassan Kachloul said \"Africa football and world football were losing\" until Mane intervened.\n\n\"What I like more than anything, the only player from the Senegalese team was Sadio Mane,\" he told E4.\n\n\"That shows the great man he is. He went back to the dressing room and brought those players back. Mane was the man to bring them back on.\"\n\nSenegal walk off in Afcon final over penalty award\n\nAfcon 2025: Senegal are champions after final descends into chaos\n\nFor Mane, it all started in Bambali.\n\nIt was in south-west Senegal that he began playing football on its red earth-lined streets and sandy pitches and where, aged 13, he watched Liverpool's famous comeback against AC Milan in the Champions League final in 2005.\n\nSince then he has gone on to lift both that prestigious trophy and the Premier League with the Reds, as well as claiming two Afcon titles with the Teranga Lions.\n\nMane scored the winning penalty against Egypt in the final of the 2021 edition and described it as \"the best day of my life and the best trophy of my life\".\n\nA stadium was named after him in the city of Sedhiou, just under 20km from his hometown, following that triumph as a recognition of his achievements.\n\nNow a two-time champion and 33 years old, Mane has capped off his Afcon career on an ultimate high.\n\nBut Gueye says the squad aim to convince Mane, who he called \"a legend of Senegal\", to change his mind about this being his final Afcon and remain with the team for at least the 2027 edition in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.\n\n\"We're going to try to keep him with us a bit longer, because he still has some great years to give,\" the 26-year-old Villarreal man told BBC Afrique.\n\n\"I heard what he said and we'll see what he decides to do. But we really want him to stay with us for many more years.\"\n\nMane, now plying his trade in Saudi Arabia with Al-Nassr, may have a glittering trophy cabinet but he has never forgotten his roots.\n\nHe won hearts with charitable acts in Bambali by pledging money to build a hospital and school, contributing to the construction of mosques and providing funds to aid the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHe also sent 300 Liverpool shirts to his hometown before the Anfield club's appearance in the 2018 Champions League final, which Real Madrid ultimately won 3-1.\n\n\"If Sadio comes here, he behaves very humbly, on a level with the people in Bambali,\" Fode Boucar Dahaba, the president of a regional league, told BBC Sport Africa on a visit to the village a few years ago.\n\n\"He doesn't want to stand out. The village gives all this love back to him.\"\n\nFamily members describe him as someone who is \"working for everybody\" and a \"good Muslim\".\n\nThat was evident during his time in England's top flight, when he helped clean the toilets at a mosque in Toxteth after one Liverpool victory.\n\n\"He wanted to remain discreet and wasn't doing it for publicity,\" said Abu Usamah Al-Tahabi, the imam at Al Rahma Mosque.\n\n\"He's not a person looking for fanfare. There's no arrogance.\"\n\nSenegal centre-back Moussa Niakhate hailed Mane as \"an incredible man\" in the lead-up to the final.\n\n\"I won't have enough time to describe what Sadio represents for African football, and more particularly for the Senegalese people,\" he added.\n\nMane has over 120 caps and is his country's record goalscorer with 53 goals.\n\nHe has so often been the hero on the pitch in recent years, and he intends to play at the World Cup later this year, where more great memories could be made.\n\nHe had an early penalty kick saved during the first half of the 2021 Afcon final but stepped up again to decide the shootout with Egypt in Yaounde.\n\nA little over a month later he settled their 2022 Fifa World Cup play-off against the Pharaohs in the same way - after that match also went the distance - although he ultimately missed out on the tournament in Qatar through injury.\n\nHe has mainly been a creative force at this year's Afcon finals, but his 78th-minute strike against Egypt, who were once again on the receiving end of Mane's magic, proved enough to send the Teranga Lions through to the final.\n\n\"That's what we expect from him,\" midfielder Idrissa Gana Gueye told the BBC World Service after his decisive intervention in Tangier on Wednesday.\n\n\"[He is] a big player and he needs to show it in big games. He showed it again.\"\n\nMane may have a humble demeanour and does not captain Senegal, but when he speaks his team-mates take note.\n\n\"In his pre-match speech [before playing Egypt] he motivated all of us,\" Pape Gueye said.\n\n\"He had the right words to make sure we went into the match fully focused.\n\n\"He has the experience of big matches, so he also knows how to calm us down. You can see it a lot in his gestures - he tells us to stay calm, even after we score or if we concede a goal.\"\n\nMane won the vast majority of his international caps under Aliou Cisse, who was in charge of the West Africans from 2015 to 2024, but current coach Pape Thiaw is understandably keen for his talisman to remain part of the national set-up.\n\n\"I think he made his decision in the heat of the moment and the country does not agree, and I as coach of the national team do not agree at all,\" Thiaw said.\n\n\"We would like to keep him for as long as possible.\"\n\nAll you need to know about Afcon 2025",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich’s Konrad Laimer spoke to the Bundesliga’s website in a recent interview. As part of the interview, he was asked what phase of his career he was in right now — both on the pitch and and from a personal perspective. @MiaSanMia recorded what he had to say to the league.\n\nThe Austrian international talked about getting older and what he has experienced. He responded with, “It’s always a bit tougher at a certain age. I’m 28, I’ve already experienced a fair bit. I’ve already played quite a few games and, yes, time always seems to pass so quickly. I actually still feel very young. You do notice that you’re a bit older, but it’s fun. I feel great and I feel I have many, many years left in me.”\n\nLaimer went on to talk about he can do to continue to play. “The most important thing is to look after your body. That’s a good thing when you’ve been playing football for a few years. I know what suits me, I know what doesn’t suit me. I know what I need, even during long weeks with tough games, to perform at 100 percent. At the moment, everything feels really, really good.”\n\nLaimer has a lot to look forward to at the moment. Bayern is clicking in all three competitions while Austria is prepping for a tough World Cup group. While Argentina will be the toughest, Argentina will have a great chance to move on to the knockout rounds. Laimer has a chance to be a pivotal part of both team’s successes.",

We accept the errors of the referee.\n\n\"We shouldn't have done it but it's done and now we present our apologies to football.\"\n\nThiaw, 44, was furious with referee Jean Jacques Ndala - who awarded the penalty after reviewing the incident on the VAR monitor - for ruling out a goal for his side moments earlier.\n\nCrystal Palace forward Ismaila Sarr had bundled home from close range, but his effort was chalked off for a foul by Abdoulaye Seck on Achraf Hakimi.\n\nAs several of the Senegal players followed Thiaw's request to leave the field, a section of their supporters threw objects and attempted to get on the field.\n\nSenegal only returned from the dressing room at the request of former Liverpool forward Sadio Mane.\n\nGueye then scored the only goal of the game with a stunning individual effort in the 94th minute.\n\nDiaz, substituted in the extra time, was left crestfallen as Morocco missed the chance to win a first Afcon title since 1976.\n\nAfter the game, Mendy insisted he was \"proud\" of the way Senegal - instructed by Mane - returned to the field to win their second Afcon title this decade.\n\n\"What did we say to each other? That's between us,\" said Mendy.\n\n\"We did it together and we came back together, that's all that matters. We can be proud tonight.\"\n\nMatch-winner Gueye added: \"We had a feeling of injustice. Just before the penalty we thought we should have had a goal and the referee didn't go to VAR.\n\n\"Sadio [Mane] told us to come back on and we remobilised. Edouard [Mendy] then made the save, we stayed focused, got the goal and won the game.\"\n\n'An ambassador for African football' - Mane is Senegal's Afcon hero\n\nDiaz will 'have nightmares' over Panenka failure\n\nAfcon 2025: Senegal are champions after final descends into chaos\n\nIt's an awful way for a tournament which had felt like such a great advert for African football to end.\n\nI couldn't believe the chaos I was witnessing from the commentary box, with some fans trying to get on to the pitch to my left and members of staff being separated down below me in the technical areas.\n\nThen the Senegal players walking down the tunnel. It was a terrible look for the Cup of Nations.\n\nIf I look back at the past few weeks covering this event there has been a huge amount of debate - more than most years - about refereeing decisions and VAR, with accusations from some journalists and fans that hosts Morocco were getting the rub of the green from some officials.\n\nIt even got to a point where refereeing appointments for certain games were becoming a talking point on social media, which put a lot of pressure on the officials before certain games.\n\nSenegal's complaints about the way they'd been treated leading up to the final - including what they felt was a lack of security when they arrived in Rabat on Friday and their lack of tickets - also increased the tension going into this game.\n\nNobody expected the scenes we witnessed after the penalty was awarded though, and this was all in front of the Fifa president Gianni Infantino who was here to present the trophy to the winning side.\n\nMorocco have been praised for the way they've organised this tournament - including from the big names like Mohamed Salah - with impressive infrastructure, stadiums and travel links.\n\nSadly for them though, with four years to go until they co-host the World Cup, the astonishing scenes before the Diaz penalty will probably be what will be most remembered about this tournament.\n\nThere is very little positive to say about the end of this game, but one person to come out of it well is Mane.\n\nHe was the one Senegal player who clearly did not want to walk down the tunnel and was telling his team-mates to come back out.\n\nHe also walked over to the Senegal fans after the full-time whistle, begging them to calm down.\n\nThere is now a line of armoured police in front of those fans to my left. It's been quite violent down there on several occasions.\n\nBefore Sunday's final in Rabat, the Senegal Football Federation (FSF) expressed \"serious concerns\" over the security of the team.\n\nThe 2021 winners were swarmed by fans when the team bus arrived in the Moroccan capital on Friday.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, the FSF also complained about the conditions of the hotel, number of tickets allocated to supporters and the fact that they were not offered a training pitch at Morocco's team base.\n\nThey said a \"lack of adequate security\" left players and staff \"at risk\".\n\n\"What happened yesterday was not normal,\" said Thiaw in his pre-match news conference.\n\n\"Given the number there, anything could have happened. My players could have been in danger.\n\n\"That type of thing should not happen between two brother countries.\"\n\nFormer Nigeria forward Efan Ekoku criticised Thiaw and his players, insisting their temporary refusal to play was \"not a good look for African football\".\n\n\"It [the penalty award] was soft,\" Ekoku told E4. \"It was foolish and reckless by El Hadji Malick Diouf, but the decision had been made and the players have to abide by that.\n\n\"You cannot do that [leave the pitch]. However aggrieved you feel at it you have got to let the referee and the rules [make the decision]... I have got some sympathy, but this is not a good look.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria's 2013 winner John Obi Mikel said he could \"understand the frustration\" but walking off is \"not what I want to see\".\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Brahim Diaz had the chance to win Afcon for Morocco, but his choice to try a Panenka ended up costing his side dearly as Senegal hit back to win the game in extra time.",
    "fullText": "It was a moment that will haunt Brahim Diaz for years to come.\n\nThe winger had a chance to write his name into Moroccan folklore after winning a penalty in the eighth minute of second-half added time with Africa Cup of Nations final against Senegal goalless.\n\nIt was a golden opportunity to end his country's 50-year wait to lift the Afcon trophy.\n\nBut Diaz, whose five goals had propelled the hosts to the final, tried a 'Panenka' chipped penalty. It backfired. Horrendously so. Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy stood his ground and caught the ball in embarrassingly simple fashion.\n\nThe former Manchester City player and tournament's top-scorer looked distraught as it began to sink in what he had done. Later, television cameras zoomed in on him on the Morocco bench, after he had been substituted in extra time, holding back tears.\n\nThe Real Madrid attacker had been made to wait around 17 minutes to take the kick after the majority of Senegal's players, including Mendy, marched off the pitch in protest at the award of the penalty.\n\n\"He had a lot of time before taking the penalty which must have disturbed him,\" said Morocco manager Walid Regragui.\n\n\"But we can't change what happened. That is how he chose to take the penalty. We need to look forwards now.\"\n\nDiaz's penalty turned out to be the last kick of normal time.\n\nFour minutes into extra time, Senegal's Pape Gueye lashed in what turned out to be the winner to leave Diaz and his Morocco team-mates heartbroken.\n\n\"I think Brahim Diaz is going to have a lot of nightmares in the coming days,\" former Morocco midfielder Hassan Kachloul said on Channel 4's coverage of the match.\n\nFormer Nigeria forward Daniel Amokachi added: \"Brahim Diaz threw away all of his glorious moments, scoring five goals in this tournament.\"\n\nAnd ex-Nigeria midfielder Jon Obi Mikel said the miss \"spoils everything Brahim Diaz has done well in this tournament\".\n\n\"He is going to be devastated,\" he added. \"This is going to be tough on him, for weeks, for months.\"\n\nEfan Ekoku, another former Nigeria international, said: \"It is a moment Brahim Diaz will never get over.\"\n\nSenegal win Afcon after chaotic final against Morocco\n\nSenegal walk off in Afcon final over penalty award\n\nAfcon 2025 podcast: Senegal are champions after final descends into chaos\n\nThe final was goalless deep into added time at the end of the second half when Diaz El Hadji Malick Diouf appeared to drag Diaz to the ground by his neck.\n\nDR Congo referee Jean-Jacques Ndala was sent to the pitchside monitor by the video assistant referee and, after a quick check, pointed to the penalty spot in the 98th minute.\n\nAlready incensed after a decision to disallow a Senegal goal in the 93rd minute, head coach Pape Thiaw tried to usher his team off the field, and several Senegal players left for the dressing room.\n\nFormer Liverpool striker Sadio Mane stayed on the pitch and tried to coax his Senegal team-mates back on to finish the match.\n\nWhen the penalty was eventually taken in the 114th minute, Diaz saw his tame attempt saved by Mendy.\n\nPape Gueye put Senegal in front four minutes into extra time. A few minutes later Diaz was substituted.\n\nThe last time Morocco won Afcon was the same year the first Panenka penalty was attempted.\n\nCzechoslovakia beat West Germany in the Euro 1976 final with probably the most famous penalty kick in history. During the shootout, midfielder Antonin Panenka waited for the goalkeeper to dive and then casually chipped the ball down the middle of the goal.\n\nSince the original, the 'Panenka' has been repeated and proven as a bona-fide - if high-risk - tactic by some of the biggest names on the most momentous occasions.\n\nZinedine Zidane scored one for France in the 2006 World Cup final, beating Italy keeper Gianluigi Buffon with an effort that went in off the crossbar.\n\nAndrea Pirlo cooly clipped one past Joe Hart as Italy beat England on penalties in the Euro 2012 quarter-final. Sergio Ramos followed suit as Spain knocked Portugal out of the semi-finals of the same tournament.\n\nLionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Thierry Henry, Neymar and Zlatan Ibrahimovic have all pulled it off.\n\nBut Diaz isn't the only player to see their attempt backfire on football's biggest stage. Zidane and Pirlo both missed Panenka's earlier in their career. Sergio Aguero, Raheem Sterling and Peter Crouch have all tried and failed.\n\nIn January, Brentford goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher made light work of an attempt in the Premier League by Sunderland's Enzo Le Fee.\n\nAdemola Lookman's dreadful attempt with the last kick of the game in a 1-0 defeat by West Ham in 2020 is up there with one of the worst Panenka penalties seen in recent years.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

Denver held on for a 33-30 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills in an instant classic in Saturday's divisional round game. Unfortunately, starting quarterback Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury in the extra frame and will be out for Denver's next game against the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship.\n\nThat means that backup QB Jarrett Stidham will get his first playoff start.\n\nDrake Maye led the Patriots — aided by five C.J. Stroud interceptions — to a 28-16 win over the Texans to earn a date in Denver.\n\nOddsmakers are making the Broncos historic home underdogs.\n\nDenver opened as a 4.5-point home underdog at BetMGM on Sunday night, which had already been pushed up to -5.5. That would be the biggest home underdog for a No. 1 seed in a conference championship game since at least 1970, per Sports Odds History. The total was set at 40.5 points.\n\nIt's Denver's first appearance in an AFC title game since 2016.",

    "fullText": "Brahim Diaz was left in tears after his fluffed ‘Panenka’-style penalty cost Morocco their first Africa Cup of Nations title in 50 years in a chaotic final against Senegal.\n\nThe Real Madrid midfielder contentiously won the spot-kick deep into second-half stoppage time with the game still goalless, giving the Atlas Lions a golden opportunity to snatch the continental crown.\n\nHowever, Senegal responded to the VAR verdict by staging a walk-off in protest, with manager Pape Thiaw ordering his players back into the dressing room in a 16-minute hiatus.\n\nWhen the Senegalese players were finally persuaded to re-emerge from the tunnel by talisman Sadio Mane, Diaz stepped up to the plate to take the spot-kick, only for goalkeeper Edouard Mendy to speak persistently to the 26-year-old to further delay the penalty.\n\nDiaz then inexplicably went for a ‘Panenka’ in the 24th minute of stoppage time and his weak penalty sailed tamely into the arms of Mendy.\n\nWith the game forced to extra time as a result, Pape Sarr went on to score the winner in stunning fashion for Senegal in the 94th minute, with his rocket of an effort proving the difference and denying the tournament hosts a first Afcon title since 1976.\n\nThe midfielder, who was substituted early into extra time, was seen in tears at full-time and looked completely dejected as he received the golden boot award from Fifa president Gianni Infantino, with his tally of five goals enough to see him end the tournament as top scorer.\n\nMendy was asked about his encounter with Diaz before the penalty was taken, replying: \"What did we say to each other? That's between us. We did it together and we came back together, that's all that matters. We can be proud tonight.”\n\nNigeria legend John Obi Mikel was left fearing the impact the performance could have on the player, who has seen an otherwise fantastic Afcon campaign ruined.\n\n“To do that it spoils everything Brahim Diaz has done well in this tournament. He is going to be devastated. This is going to be tough on him, for weeks, for months,” Mikel told E4.\n\n“Again, it is a shame to see. Brahim Diaz has had a superb tournament.

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots continued their remarkable turnaround this season by beating the Houston Texans 28-16 to reach the AFC Championship game.\n\nAfter winning just four games in his rookie season, quarterback Drake Maye led the Patriots to a 14-3 record and an unexpected play-off appearance.\n\nThe 23-year-old is a leading contender to be named the NFL's Most Valuable Player and overcame both snow and the vaunted Texans defence to win Sunday's Divisional Round game in Massachusetts.\n\nThat secured the Patriots' first AFC Championship game since 2019, when legendary quarterback Tom Brady and New England claimed their sixth Super Bowl victory.\n\nHouston's defence was ranked as the NFL's best this season and although the Texans claimed their first play-off win on the road last week, they have suffered a third straight exit at this stage.\n\nThe Patriots will be on away territory next week as they travel to face the Denver Broncos, the AFC's top seed, for a place in Super Bowl 60 on Sunday, 8 February.\n\nNFL play-offs: Patriots reach AFC Championship game, Rams v Bears to come\n\nMike Vrabel was Brady's team-mate for three of those Super Bowl wins and in his first season as New England's head coach, the Patriots claimed 10 more wins than in 2024 - tied for the biggest turnaround in NFL history.\n\nThe Patriots have been one of this season's best all-round teams, claiming the AFC's second seed and their first AFC East division title in seven years in Brady's last season in New England.\n\nIn Maye, the Patriots have finally found Brady's long-term successor. He is a year younger than the record seven-time Super Bowl winner was when he claimed his first NFL title in 2002, and in this match, the quarterback again showed a maturity beyond his years.\n\nBoth he and opposite number CJ Stroud struggled with the wintry conditions and Maye had four fumbles, two of them resulting in turnovers. He also had one interception and was sacked five times by Houston's fearsome pass rush.\n\nHowever, he also delivered three touchdown passes, two of them to help establish a 21-10 lead at half-time and the latter a 32-yard deep shot in the fourth quarter to Kayshon Boutte, who made a superb one-handed grab to seal victory.\n\nMeanwhile, after throwing just eight interceptions in 14 games during the regular season, Houston's third-year quarterback Stroud had four interceptions in the first half alone, with one of them returned for a touchdown by Marcus Jones.\n\nIronically, Maye will now go up against Jarrett Stidham, who was initially seen as Brady's successor when drafted in 2019 and was back-up for the legendary quarterback's final season in New England.\n\nAfter joining Denver in 2023, 29-year-old Stidham is now set for only the fifth start of his NFL career because Broncos' first-choice quarterback Bo Nix suffered a broken ankle in their Divisional Round win over Buffalo on Saturday.\n\nConference seed in brackets, all kick-off times GMT\n\nLos Angeles Rams (5) @ Chicago Bears (2) - 23:30\n\nAFC Championship: New England Patriots (2) @ Denver Broncos (1) - 20:00\n\nNFC Championship: Rams or Bears @ Seattle Seahawks (1) - 23:30\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "Heart Rate Variability",
    "description": "Your heart rate variability (HRV) is a powerful metric of your overall health. HRV measures the difference in time between each heartbeat, which fluctuates slightly. High HRV is generally considered better. Low HRV can be caused by medical conditions, stress, or intense fitness training.",
    "fullText": "Your heart rate variability (HRV) is a powerful—if complex—metric of your overall health. Your Apple Watch automatically measures HRV, including while sleeping. We’ll try to give an overview here, but you could really write a whole book on what HRV means.\n\nA healthy heart is not a metronome: as your heart beats, the timing between each beat shifts slightly. For example, one heart beat may come 900 millseconds after another, and then the next one 950 millseconds after that. That’s healthy and good.\n\nYour HRV measures the variation in time between these heart beats. The unit of HRV is millseconds, and a normal HRV is 18-76ms.\n\nWhile HRV is derived from heart rate, it’s actually a broader window into your overall health.\n\nThe main influence on HRV is your autonomic nervous system (ANS). Since your ANS is connected to your liver, kidney, stomach, brain, and more, HRV is actually a really powerful metric of many different organ systems in your body. We’ll cover the autonomic nervous system more below, including the how HRV sometimes reflects medical conditions like anxiety, depression, dysautonomia, digestive tract problems, and more.\n\nAnything between 18 to 76 ms is a normal heart rate variability. Within 18-76ms, higher HRVs are usually better.\n\nDepending on age and sex, below 18 ms is a low HRV. This is around the bottom 10%. An HRV above 76 ms would put you in the 90th percentile of Apple Watch users.\n\nThe Apple Watch measures the time of each heart beat using its optical heart rate sensor. Apple Watch calculates HRV using SDNN: the standard deviation between normal-to-normal heart beat intevals.\n\nSDNN is defined mathematically as:\n\nSDNN = sqrt(Σ(NN_i - mean(NN))² / (N - 1))\n\nHere’s an example. Let’s say your heart is beating around 60bpm. The spacing between heart beats isn’t going to be exactly 1 second—it will vary a little bit, beat to beat. Let’s say the first heart beat comes, then a second one 1040 ms later, then a third heart beat 960 ms later, then a final heart beat exactly 1000ms later. Your NN intervals are then 1040ms, 960ms, and 1000ms.\n\nYour average N-N (normal to normal) interval is 1000ms. The standard deviation is 32.6 ms. That means your HRV\nis 32.6 ms, using the SDNN method. Other wearables like Whoop use different formulas for HRV, such as RMSSD, which we’ll explain now.\n\nThere are several formulas to calculate HRV. The two most common are SDNN (used by Apple Watch) and RMSSD:\n\nHRV is influenced by your autonomic nervous system, which has two branches: the sympathetic nervous system (your “fight or flight” response) and the parasympathetic nervous system (your “rest and digest” response, which is controlled by the vagus nerve). When the sympathetic nervous system dominates, HRV is lower. When the parasympathetic nervous system dominates, HRV is higher.\n\nA low or high HRV can have many meanings and causes, including mental health, dysautonomia, diabetes, or simply stress. Let’s go\nthrough each potential cause.\n\nA common cause of temporary low HRV on your Apple Watch is stress or intense fitness training. However, medical conditions\ncan also cause low HRVs (or high HRVs). The most common conditions that affect HRV are dysautonomia, anxiety, depression, nerve damage, abnormal heart rhythms, and some gut health conditions.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of dysautonomia is imbalance between the sympathetic nervous system (often overactive) and the parasympathetic nervous system (often withdrawn). People with dysautonomia, POTS, and Long Covid often haver low HRV. While HRV itself is not used in diagnosis of POTS, the pattern of heart rate and blood pressure when going from laying to standing is. You can book an appointment with an Empirical Health doctor\nto get POTS testing and treatment.\n\nLow HRV can sometimes be a sign of depression or anxiety. Improving HRV through practices like mindfulness, physical activity, stress management, and medication can support better emotional regulation and mental health.\n\nNerve damage (for example, from diabetes) can cause low HRV. Nerve damage affects HRV by disrupting the balance and communication between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. When nerves responsible for these regulatory pathways are damaged, the body’s ability to adjust heart rate in response to stressors and environmental changes becomes impaired. This leads to a decrease in HRV.\n\nFinally, very low or high HRV can also be caused by an electrical problem in the heart (for example, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or supraventricular tachycardia). In these cases, an ECG can give more diagnostic information on exactly what is happening in the heart’s electrical system.\n\nThe image above shows two common abnormal heart rhythms, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, on an ECG. Atrial fibrillation is highly irregular, leading to high HRV. Atrial flutter is very regular, leading to no or low HRV. Either of these rhythms require attention from a medical professional.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 4 and above include an FDA-cleared ECG sensor that can help distinguish whether low or high HRV is caused by an abnormal heart rhythm. The current Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 9 (released in 2025) both include the ECG sensor, but not\nthe Apple Watch SE3.\n\nSince the vagus nerve is connected with your stomach, intenstines, liver, and so on, low HRV can sometimes be correlated with problems in the digestive tract.\n\nBecause HRV correlates with so much in the body, it’s a powerful metric but doesn’t give specific diagnostic information on exactly what’s wrong. If you have concerns or questions about HRV, it’s best to talk with a doctor about your specific medical situation. You can book an appointment through the Empirical Health app.\n\nWhat is HRV and what does it have to do with health?\n\nRaquel Rodriguez Martinez, MD, MPP\n\nYour guide to Apple Watch's heart rate monitor",

Of the 447 Palestinians killed between the ceasefire taking effect and Tuesday, at least 77 were killed by Israeli gunfire near the line, including 62 who crossed it, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.",
    "fullText": "CAIRO (AP) — A dividing line, at times invisible, can mean life or death for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThose sheltering near the territory's “yellow line” that the Israeli military withdrew to as part of the October ceasefire say they live in fear as Israeli soldiers direct near-daily fire at anyone who crosses or even lingers near it.\n\nOf the 447 Palestinians killed between the ceasefire taking effect and Tuesday, at least 77 were killed by Israeli gunfire near the line, including 62 who crossed it, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Among them were teenagers and young children, The Associated Press found.\n\nAnd although the military has placed some yellow barrels and concrete barriers delineating the limits of the Palestinian zone, the line is still unmarked in certain places and in others was laid nearly half a kilometer (0.3 miles) deeper than what was agreed to in the ceasefire deal, expanding the part of Gaza that Israel controls, according to Palestinians and mapping experts.\n\n“We stay away from the barrels. No one dares to get close” said Gaza City resident Ahmed Abu Jahal, noting that the markers are less than 100 meters (110 yards) from his house — instead of the roughly 500 meters (546 yards) outlined in a map put out by the Israeli military.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the military had acknowledged killing 57 people around the yellow line, saying most were militants. It said its troops are complying with the rules of engagement in order to counter militant groups, and are informing Palestinians of the line’s location and marking it on the ground to “reduce friction and prevent misunderstandings.”\n\nUnder the ceasefire, Israel withdrew its troops to a buffer zone that is up to 7 kilometers (4 miles) deep and includes most of Gaza's arable land, its elevated points and all of its border crossings. That hems more than 2 million Palestinians into a strip along the coastline and central Gaza.\n\nPeople of all ages, some already dead, have been showing up almost daily at the emergency room of Gaza City's Al-Ahli hospital with bullet wounds from straying near the line, said hospital director Fadel Naeem.\n\nAmid the vast destruction in Gaza, the demarcation line often isn't easy to detect, Naeem said. He recounted picking his way through undamaged paths during a recent visit to the southern city of Khan Younis. He didn't notice he was almost across the line until locals shouted at him to turn back, he said.\n\nThe Israeli military said most of the people it has killed crossing the line posed a threat to its troops. According to a military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military rules, troops issue audible warnings and then fire warning shots whenever someone crosses the line. Many civilians retreat when warning shots are fired, though some have been killed, the official acknowledged.\n\nKilled while playing near the line\n\nZaher Shamia, 17, lived with his grandfather in a tent 300 meters (330 yards) from the line in northern Gaza’s Jabaliya refugee camp. On Dec. 10, he was playing with his cousin and some friends near the line, according to video he took before his death.\n\nSuddenly, shots rang out and the video stopped. Soldiers approaching the line with an armored bulldozer had fired on the teens, hitting Zaher, said a witness.\n\nA neighbor eventually found Zaher’s body, which had been crushed by the bulldozer, said Zaher's grandfather, Kamal al-Beih: “We only recognized him from his head.\"\n\nTwo doctors, Mohamed Abu Selmiya and Rami Mhanna, confirmed that the teen had been killed by gunshots and then run over by a bulldozer. The military official said he was aware that Shamia was a civilian and that the military was looking into it.\n\nMaram Atta said that on Dec. 7, her 3-year-old daughter, Ahed al-Bayouk, was playing with siblings outside of their tent, which was near the yellow line along Gaza's southern coast. Atta was preparing lentils when she heard aircraft overhead, then shots.\n\nA stray projectile whizzed close to her and struck Ahed, who was dead before they reached the clinic.\n\n“I lost my daughter to what they keep calling a ‘ceasefire’” said Atta, crying. “What ceasefire are they talking about?”\n\nA military official denied the killing.\n\nThe line's exact location is ambiguous, differing on maps put out by the Israeli military and the White House.\n\nNeither matches the line troops appear to be marking on the ground, according to Palestinians and geolocation specialists.\n\nChris Osiek, an open source intelligence analyst and consultant, has geolocated a number of yellow blocks based on social media videos. He found at least four urban areas where troops set the blocks several hundred meters deeper into Gaza than the military map-specified yellow line.\n\n“This is basically what you get when you simply let Trump make an image and post it on Truth Social and let the IDF make their own,” he said, using the acronym for the military. “If it’s not a proper system, with coordinates that make it easy for people to navigate where it is, then you leave the ambiguity free for the IDF to interpret the yellow line how they basically want.”\n\nThe military official dismissed such criticism, saying any deviations from the map amount to just a few meters. But to Palestinians hemmed in by widespread destruction and displacement, every few meters lost is another house that can't be sheltered in — another they doubt will ever be returned.\n\n‘The line is getting very close’\n\nUnder the ceasefire, Israeli forces are only supposed to remain at the yellow line until a fuller withdrawal, though the agreement doesn't give a timeline for that. With the next steps in the deal lagging and troops digging into positions on the Israeli side, though, Palestinians wonder if they are witnessing a permanent land takeover.\n\nIn December, Israel’s defense minister described the yellow line as “a new border line — serving as a forward defensive line for our communities and a line of operational activity.”\n\nThe military has continued leveling buildings inside the Israeli-held zone, turning already damaged neighborhoods to moonscapes. Almost all of the city of Rafah, on Gaza's border with Egypt, has been razed over the past year. The army says this is necessary to destroy tunnels and prepare the area for reconstruction.\n\nIn some places, demolitions since the ceasefire have encroached beyond the official yellow line. Since November, troops have leveled a swath of Gaza City’s Tuffah neighborhood extending some 300 meters (330 yards) outside the Israeli-held zone, according to Oct. 14 and Dec. 18 satellite photos provided by Planet Labs.\n\nAbu Jahal moved back to his damaged house in Tuffah at the ceasefire's start. He said he frequently saw new yellow barrels appear and the military forcing out anyone living on its side of the markers.\n\nOn Jan. 7, Israeli fire hit a house near him, and the residents had to evacuate, he said. Abu Jahal said his family — including his wife, their child, and seven other relatives — may also have to leave soon.\n\n“The line is getting very close,” he said.",

    "fullText": "China is now a key market for global carmakers, and, surprisingly, buyers there are shifting back to sedans that offer serious tech. Automakers are pushing boundaries to get noticed, and Nissan is one of them. The brand launched two new electrified sedans and a refreshed Teana late last year – the latter being the more premium take on the Altima sold in the US.\n\nThe new Teana, built by Dongfeng Nissan, puts a big emphasis on tech and interior quality. It looks a class above what you’d expect from an Altima-based sedan. Part of that comes from a glowing AI speaker on the dash, but the real surprise is the material choice. Nissan worked with Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (MCC) to use Durabio, a plant-based plastic that looks and feels closer to crystal than the usual trim.\n\nIn China, buyers care about big screens, lighting, and how upscale a car feels. The Teana’s interior is built to make a strong first impression, and it stands out even more when you see it lit up at night.\n\nDurabio is more than just a marketing fluff. MCC developed it as a bio-based plastic using plant-derived isosorbide. It’s clearer and handles light better than regular polycarbonate, which helps create lighting that looks deep and high-end instead of cheap or artificial.\n\nOn the Teana, Durabio is used for the inverted-pyramid AI speaker that lights up with six pillars glowing in up to 256 colors. The material refracts light cleanly, giving it a crystal-like look without needing a clear coat. That saves manufacturing steps, lowers environmental footprint, and still meets automotive durability standards.\n\nTeana runs a Huawei-based operating system to go with Durabio. The end result is an interior that feels modern and thoughtfully put together (at least visually), not just a quick update.\n\nMeanwhile, the US-market Altima heads into 2026 with almost no changes from last year. It remains affordable and practical, but next to the Teana, it comes across as very restrained. Nissan still sells a lot of sedans in the US, with over 255,000 units last year (out of the brand's over 760,000-unit sales), but the Altima’s own sales dropped to 93,268 in 2025, down 18 percent from the year before.\n\nThat drop probably comes from the Altima’s age. The current model dates back to 2018, with its last big update in 2022. It no longer stands out for design or interior appeal. After seeing what Nissan has done with the Teana, it’s fair to ask (hope, even) if a more upscale, more distinctive Altima could bring buyers back to the midsize sedan segment.\n\nFor now, there’s no clear answer. But with China getting the more ambitious upgrades, it’s easy to see how a bit of that Durabio-inspired thinking could only help the Altima.\n\nView the 9 images of this gallery on the original article",

    "fullText": "A fight broke out at Knott’s Berry Farm in Orange County Saturday night after a guest allegedly tried to cut the line and was stopped by a worker, according to a witness who recorded the incident.\n\nVideo obtained by KTLA shows two guests and a security guard involved in an altercation near an outdoor entrance area at the park as a crowd watches and cheers from behind metal barricades. Several bystanders can be seen recording the scene on their phones.\n\nOne witness said the incident happened Saturday, Jan. 17, when a guest attempted to cut the line and was denied by a worker. Officials have not confirmed this information as of Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe witness said the situation escalated, and the same guest later swung at a security guard, causing the guard to suffer a nosebleed.\n\nFootage from the scene appeared to capture moments after the confrontation began. Two guests are seen — one seems to be attempting to mediate between another guest and the security guard with the nosebleed. The other guest manages to get around and hit the security guard, but is then immediately taken to the ground by the guard while the nearby line of people start to cheer.\n\nWhile the guard restrains the woman on the pavement and directs her to put her hands behind her back, another guard is seen standing nearby, monitoring the altercation and maintaining control of the area.\n\n“Knott’s staff did an excellent job in deescalting the situation, and made it less traumatic then it was even if her nose was bleeding and she was getting assaulted by the lady she did not use pepper spray or violence, she quickly got her on the floor,” said the witness.\n\nThe clip ends with the individual still on the ground as security remains on scene. The witness said that after the video concluded, law enforcement arrived on scene and handcuffed both guests who were seen in the video.\n\nIn a statement provided to KTLA, Knott’s Berry Farm said it is “committed to providing a safe and orderly environment for all guests and does not tolerate inappropriate behavior.” The park said all visitors are required to follow its Code of Conduct to maintain a family-friendly environment, and confirmed that Buena Park Police Department arrested two guests Saturday night for violating that policy.\n\nThe guests were removed from an attraction for allegedly jumping the line before the situation escalated into a physical confrontation involving a park employee and a security officer. Both guests were arrested and removed from the park, officials said.",

This is a geopolitical decision, and he's able to use the economic might of the US to avoid a hot war, so why wouldn't we do that?\"\n\nGreenland is strategically located in the Arctic, acting as a buffer between North America and Russia. It is also home to minerals important to the manufacturing of future technologies.\n\nTrump has recently said that at least part of his reasoning for wanting to annex Greenland is so it can house his Golden Dome missile defense project.\n\n\"The president is trying to avoid a conflict,\" Bessent said.\n\nThat project remains in early planning stages, however, and Denmark has never said it wouldn't allow Golden Dome infrastructure on its territory. The United States already has a military base in Greenland.\n\nThe spectre that the United States — recently emboldened by its surprise raid on Venezuela that netted its leader, Nicolás Maduro, allowing it to move to open the country's oil industry — could force Europe's hand by targeting its economy or even take Greenland by force, has rankled US allies across the Atlantic.\n\nEuropean Union leaders held an emergency meeting on Sunday, during which they called Trump's tariff threat economic blackmail.\n\n\"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,\" the eight EU nations targeted by Trump said in a joint statement released on Sunday.",

In SHRM's 2025 benefits survey, leave was the second-highest priority for workers — trailing only health benefits — for the fourth year in a row.\n\nA peer-reviewed study published in the Academy of Management in 2022 interviewed 50 professionals who had taken extended time off. All interviewees said they came back as better leaders.\n\nDJ DiDonna, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School and coauthor of the study, says everyone he interviewed wished they had taken one earlier.\n\nDiDonna told Business Insider that the best times for a sabbatical often coincide with natural life transitions, like a honeymoon, a newly empty nest, or the \"twilight career\" stage before retirement.\n\nThis collection brings together people who took that pause at different ages, for different reasons, and for vastly different lengths of time.\n\nIf you've taken an adult gap year yourself, I'd love to hear from you at akarplus@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican lawmakers are scrambling to contain President Donald Trump's threats of taking possession of Greenland, with some showing the most strident opposition to almost anything the Trump administration has done since taking office.\n\nThey gave floor speeches on the importance of NATO last week. They introduced bills meant to prevent the U.S. from attacking Denmark. And several traveled to Copenhagen to meet with Danish counterparts.\n\nBut it's not clear that will be enough, as the president continues to insist that he will take control of the Arctic island. It's raised fears of an end to NATO — a decades-old alliance that has been a pillar of American strength in Europe and around the globe — and raised questions on Capitol Hill and around the world about what Trump's aggressive, go-it-alone foreign policy will mean for world order.\n\n“When the most powerful military nation on earth threatens your territory through its president over and over and over again, you start to take it seriously,” Sen. Chris Coons told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Delaware Democrat organized the bipartisan trip to Denmark to “bring the temperature down a bit,” he said, as well as further talks about mutual military agreements in the Arctic. Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska accompanied a handful of Democrats on the trip. Also, Republican lawmakers joined in meetings in Washington last week with the Danish foreign minister and his Greenlandic counterpart where they discussed security agreements.\n\nYet it's clear Trump has other ideas. He said Saturday he will charge a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight European nations because of their opposition to his Greenland plans.\n\nTrump said on social media that because of modern weapons systems “the need to ACQUIRE is especially important.”\n\nThe pushback to Trump's Greenland plans\n\nKey Republicans have made clear they think that forcefully taking Greenland is out of the question. But so far, they've avoided directly rebuking Trump for his talk of possessing the island.\n\nTillis on social media called Trumps tariff plans “bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America’s allies.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters Thursday that “there’s certainly not an appetite here for some of the options that have been talked about or considered.”\n\nIn a floor speech, Thune's predecessor as Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell, warned that an attempt to seize Greenland would “shatter the trust of allies\" and tarnish Trump's legacy with a disastrous foreign policy decision.\n\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers alike see an obvious path to bolstering American interests in Greenland while keeping the relationship with NATO-ally Denmark intact.\n\nIn a meeting with lawmakers Thursday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt discussed how the countries could work together to develop critical mineral industries and military cooperation, Coons said. The diplomats also told the senators there is no evidence of Chinese or Russian activity in Greenland.\n\nTrump has made the argument that the U.S. should take Greenland before China or Russia do, prompting worry across Europe. Troops from several nations have been sent to Greenland in support of Denmark.\n\nMurkowski said on social media that “our NATO allies are being forced to divert attention and resources to Greenland, a dynamic that plays directly into Putin’s hands by threatening the stability of the strongest coalition of democracies the world has ever seen.”\n\nLawmakers are looking at a few options for taking a military attack on Greenland off the table. Still, the Trump administration has shown little if any willingness to get congressional approval before taking military action.\n\nLawmakers, including Republicans like Murkowski, are pushing legislation that would prohibit Department of Defense funds from being used to attack or occupy territory that belongs to other NATO members without their consent.\n\nThe Alaska senator also suggested Congress could act to nullify Trump's tariffs. Murkowski and several other Republicans have already helped pass resolutions last year meant to undo tariffs around the globe, but those pieces of legislation did not gain traction in the House. They would have also required Trump's signature or support from two-thirds of both chambers to override his veto.\n\nDemocrats have also found some traction with war powers resolutions meant to force the president to get congressional approval before engaging in hostilities. Republicans last week narrowly defeated one such resolution that would prohibit Trump from attacking Venezuela again, and Democrats think there could potentially be more Republicans who would support one applying to Greenland.\n\n“What I’ve noticed is these war powers resolutions, they do put some pressure on Republicans,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who has forced votes on several similar resolutions. He said the tactic has also compelled the Trump administration to provide lawmakers with briefings and commitments to get congressional approval before deploying troops.\n\nStill, while dismissing the Venezuela war powers resolution on Wednesday, Republican leaders made the argument that the legislation should be ruled out of order because the Trump administration has said there are currently no U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela.\n\nThat argument may set a precedent for future war powers resolutions, giving Republicans a way to avoid voting against Trump's wishes.\n\n“If you don't have boots on the ground, it's a moot point,” said Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, about war powers resolutions in general. He also argued that the prospect of taking Greenland over the objections of Denmark is nothing \"more than a hypothetical.”\n\nOther Republicans have expressed support for Trump's insistence that the U.S. possess Greenland, though they have downplayed the idea that the U.S. would take it by force.\n\nThat's left the strongest objections on the Republican side of the aisle coming from a handful of lawmakers who are leaving Congress next year.\n\nRep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told The Omaha World Herald that an invasion of Greenland would lead to Trump's impeachment — something he would “lean” towards supporting.\n\nTillis, another retiring Republican, has directed his criticism at Trump advisors like White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller.\n\n“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisors’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Jan 18 (Reuters) - Syrian troops fighting U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces seized the Omar oil field, the country’s largest, and the Conoco gas field in the eastern Deir Zor province as allied Arab tribal forces advanced ​in the oil-rich area along the border with Iraq, officials and security sources said on Sunday.\n\nThe takeover ‌of the oil fields that lie east of the Euphrates River — a main source of revenue for the Kurdish-led forces — was a major blow to ‌the group.\n\nSyrian government officials said the oil wealth the militia had controlled to sustain its self-administered region had deprived the state of much‑needed resources.\n\nSyrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa said last week it was unacceptable for a militia to control a quarter of the country and hold its main oil and commodities resources.\n\nThe Syrian army pressed ahead into predominantly Arab-populated areas of northeast Syria controlled ⁠by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), despite ‌U.S. calls to halt its advance.\n\nA government source said Kurdish-led forces were overcome after advances led by the Arab tribal fighters, allowing the government and its tribal allies to move into ‍a stretch of territory of more than 150 km along the eastern bank of the Euphrates stretching from Baghouz near the Iraqi border towards key towns, including al-Shuhail and Busayra.\n\nSyrian government officials said the advances effectively brought most of Deir al-Zor province — the country’s main ​oil- and wheat-producing area along the Euphrates — under their control.\n\nLate on Saturday, the army also took control of the ‌northern city of Tabqa and its adjacent dam, as well as the major Freedom Dam, formerly known as the Baath Dam, west of Raqqa.\n\nSyrian Kurdish authorities have not acknowledged the loss of those strategic sites and said fighting continued near the dam area, accusing Damascus of breaching an agreement on the withdrawal of forces from areas east of Aleppo to expand its offensive.\n\nSyrian Kurdish officials said factions aligned with the government were attacking their forces despite efforts to reach a peaceful ⁠outcome. The civil administration that runs the region said Damascus was intent ​on sowing divisions between Arabs and Kurds.\n\n“We are at a critical ​juncture. We either resist or live in dignity and face all types of injustice,” their statement said, urging residents of the majority-Arab areas to stand by the SDF.\n\n“We call on our people, especially ‍the youth, to take up arms ⁠and prepare to resist any attack. We are facing a war for our survival,” it added.\n\nThe government had called on SDF fighters — most of whom are from Arab tribes — to defect. It says hundreds have already ⁠switched sides and joined tribal forces fighting the SDF.\n\nDozens of Arab tribal leaders have said they had been marginalised under Kurdish leadership, a claim ‌the SDF denies, saying its ranks reflect the diversity of Syrian society.",

    "fullText": "Of all the explanations for Donald Trump’s attempt to seize Greenland, the most superficially attractive is that the President has dementia. In which case, why not just pretend to give it to him? Fly him to somewhere that looks green, throw a military parade, and tell him that’s it. Senile fantasy fulfilled.\n\nAlas, the rot goes so much deeper. Trump is not mad, he’s doing what America always does, just crassly and out in the open. This became clearer this week when I chanced upon a copy of Lament for a Nation by the Canadian philosopher George Grant, published in 1965.\n\nGrant wrote at a turning point in his country’s history. In 1957, Canada had elected a conservative PM called John Diefenbaker who was not unlike Nigel Farage or, indeed, Trump: populist, nationalist, deeply anti-Left. But when the Americans asked to put their nuclear weapons on his soil, Diefenbaker – to my surprise – said no.\n\nHe believed he had a right to do this because Nato is, on paper, an alliance of equals – and a necessity because once Canada became a missile base, all pretence of an independent foreign policy would end.\n\nThe business and cultural elite turned on Diefenbaker and the public kicked him out of office.\n\nAmerica, basking in the glow of Jack Kennedy, was then admired as the embodiment of modernity: nationalism seemed antiquated and eccentric. Thus, argued Grant, Canada’s nuclear surrender represented the final stage in a process of economic and cultural assimilation. A society so integrated into the American Way lacked not just the resources but, crucially, the imagination to stand on its own two feet.\n\nSo it goes with contemporary Europe, where American corporations dominate and profit, yet also avoid paying a lot of tax. Ireland, for example, has rightly denounced Trump’s tariff war on the nations that oppose his aggressive takeover of Greenland – yet the country is a model of globalist acquiescence at the cost of sovereignty. It has embraced free markets (low corporate taxes) and free movement (mass migration), with the result that Dublin is outwardly Irish – still beautiful – yet unaffordable and embroiled in a violent identity crisis.\n\nThese are economic policies that its elites justify as essential to modern nation building (“we need money, we need workers”), and it’s striking that the SNP has proposed doing similar things should Scotland gain independence. As Grant observed in 1965, the modern nation state can only develop by opening its arms to global capitalism, but global capitalism “entails the disappearance of those indigenous differences that give substance to nationalism.”\n\nIn short, American capital has made all of us rich, but it has also made us duplicates of the US. I’m convinced that many Britons are desperately unhappy, even mentally ill, because they don’t feel like themselves anymore.\n\nIt’s obvious in the way we now talk (badly) and emote (too often) but most apparent in our politics, which is imported and detached from our real history. Identity politics was Made in America: when federal agents shot and killed a protestor in Minnesota (murder in my book), Labour mayors felt obliged to write a letter of support for the Democrat mayor of Minneapolis. Why?\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, James Cleverly says his hero is Ronald Reagan, the Tories sell the good life in terms of Reaganite aspiration, and the infamous Jenrick memo, written to plot his defection to Reform, described him as the “new sheriff in town”. Its author spelt favourite without a “u”.\n\nThe party Rob joins has painted itself into a corner, having gambled its credentials on access to Trump and now forced to pretend there’s distance. Lo, even Brexit has been colonised. Outside of the European Union, said its Right-wing think-tankers, the only hope is a deal with America, a logic that even Keir Starmer has swallowed, pursuing regulatory alignment on the future of AI.\n\nOne suspects that for all Labour’s hatred of Elon Musk, it will never ban Twitter, because Trump will almost certainly apply sanctions.\n\nWe should not think of the President as un-American, as some embarrassed Americans call him, but the most American president ever, which is to say the ultimate liberal.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans, even if they disagree on practical policies, are both drawn from the philosophical tradition of liberalism, rooted in love of individual freedom, the unleashing of personal passion. Trump wants something, so he makes it happen. That’s what liberalism means, and it has infected us, too.\n\nIt’s why in the UK marriage and birth are out of style, pews are empty, and our top-rated TV show involves traitors killing faithfuls for cash (“she’s playing a blinder,” they say, as if human relations are a competitive sport).\n\nIf Britain is broken – and a country where the latest figures show 299,614 abortions a year, 40 for a cleft lip or palate, is definitely broken – it is because millions have chosen to maximise their freedom and wealth at the cost of social solidarity.\n\nThe Old Canada of John Diefenbaker, claimed Grant, was different because it combined the Tory paternalism of England with the ethics of French Catholicism, which said “virtue must be prior to freedom.” But these are gone, and Grant concluded that their demise was unavoidable because no nation can resist the power of America or the temptation of individualism.\n\nLiberalism ends, if not quite in world government, then in the whole world looking the same. What do the Japanese eat on Christmas Day? KFC.\n\nThis is why I watch the trade war for Greenland with distress and, I’m afraid, pessimism. Yes, Trump must be resisted. It is a question of dignity.\n\nBut until we Europeans wean ourselves off America, not just militarily or economically but psychologically, we really cannot function without it and will always surrender. It has dominated us for a long time; we’ve only noticed since the empire that pushed out investment suddenly started to suck it back in, a phenomenon that, again, is not unique to Trump. Joe Biden used subsidies and tax breaks to re-shore jobs in the US, away from the continent.\n\nThe irony is that alternative, more benign American political traditions do exist, but they’ve always been dismissed by Europeans as naive or dangerous because they wouldn’t bankroll our defence: libertarian among the Republicans, socialist among the Democrats. If only we’d had president Ron Paul or president Bernie Sanders. Greenland would go unmolested.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

We have to address that. It's been spoken about already but we have to address it again apparently.\n\n\"We have another 48 hours to assess it, ourselves and the staff, and we will debrief and then we have to act.\n\n\"I'd say there is something lacking at the moment and we want to change that.\"\n\nThis is the first season since 1980-81 that Liverpool have failed to beat any of the promoted sides at Anfield. They are seven points behind third-placed Aston Villa, who have a game in hand.\n\n\"That's the reality and we need support,\" Van Dijk added. \"I don't like boos from my own fans.\"",

Ifab believes this shows zero tolerance to concussion.\n\nA player who is believed to have experienced a concussion must be substituted and cannot go back on to the pitch.\n\nBut the Premier League argues permanent substitutions create a greater chance a team will risk leaving a player on the field.\n\nWith the temporary substitutes a player would be removed from the field for 10-15 minutes for a full medical assessment. If there is no concussion the player would then be able to return.",

There is reported interest in Como defender Jacabo Ramon – who is also attracting attention from Real Madrid – and Bournemouth's Marcos Senesi.\n\nSenesi, whose contract expires at the end of the season, is also a Juventus target, while the south-coast club have yet to receive any formal contact from Chelsea.\n\nChelsea had previously explored signing a centre-back for former manager Enzo Maresca last summer, but key target Dean Huijsen opted to join Real Madrid.\n\nOther options were assessed but Chelsea did not believe they could find a suitable alternative, contributing to one of Maresca's early frustrations that eventually played a part in his mid-season departure.\n\nThe desire to sign a ball-playing centre-back came after Levi Colwill sustained a serious knee injury in pre-season, although his recovery is progressing well and there is optimism he will feature later in the campaign. He remains central to Chelsea's long-term plans.\n\nThere is also growing expectation that both Trevoh Chalobah and Tosin Adarabioyo will reach a crossroads in the summer, when they will have two years remaining on their contracts and either sign new deals or face the possibility of being sold.",
