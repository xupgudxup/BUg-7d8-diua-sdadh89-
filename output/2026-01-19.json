    "fullText": "Freiburg secured a hard-fought draw in Augsburg by scoring twice in the space of two minutes after starting the second-half with the hosts doing the same in five minutes. Julian Schuster is satisfied with the result after they suffered their first defeat of the year against RB Leipzig in midweek.\n\n“It’s frustrating that we went behind,” the Freiburg coach referred to their slow start after the break. “The reaction we showed with the fresh legs was very good, though. Then, we even scored a goal that was chalked off. Even if Augsburg created another chance, we can see the positives in the last half an hour.”\n\nIgor Matanovic, who scored Freiburg’s equalizer, saw his second goal chalked off due to the ball crossing the line in the buildup. “Both teams had so much space (to create chances). I think we would’ve had the chance to win if we played better in a couple of situations.”\n\nFreiburg will play two games at the Europa-Park in the space of four days as they host Köln after their final home game of the Europa League league phase stage against Maccabi Tel Aviv.",

He’s the only coach that has coached this long and does not have a tree. Guys are emotionally attached to him, not performance.

    "fullText": "As Lexi Thompson steps away from the LPGA spotlight, the golf star is embracing a new chapter in her personal life. Turning heads off the course, Thompson recently celebrated her bachelorette party in style, offering fans a glimpse into her wedding preparations. The joyful milestone arrives amid her competitive hiatus, marking a moment of balance between career reflection and personal celebration as she prepares for the next phase of her life.\n\nLexi Thompson took to Instagram to share some moments from her bachelorette party.\n\n“So much fun at @moxiesusa for bachelorette celebrations,” captioned Thompson below a series of pictures from her bachelorette.\n\nThe LPGA Tour pro celebrated with her friends at the Moxies restaurant. Thompson is set to marry Max Provost in March 2026.\n\nBack in early 2025, the 30-year-old announced her engagement to Provost. According to the reports, Provost asked the all-important question to Thompson on New Year’s Day 2025, in Whistler, Canada. And much to his elation, the 1x major champion gave the nod, agreeing to be tied with Provost for life. While Max Provost is keeping his life very private, from his LinkedIn profile, we can see that he is a Clinical Sales Representative for Intuitive Surgical.\n\n“I work with physicians and surgeons to help with the adoption of daVinci robotics in surgery. I help enhance the lives of patients by offering and educating on a state-of-the-art minimally invasive surgical modality that leads to faster recovery, less complications, and a better overall quality of life,” his bio reads.\n\nAs of now, Thompson is semi-retired. Following her participation in the 2024 U.S. Women’s Open, Thompson declared that she will no longer participate in a full LPGA season from now on.\n\nThompson turned pro at just 15 years of age. She has, till now, clinched 15 professional titles, out of which 11 of her victories came in the LPGA Tour. Thus, when she announced a semi-retirement from her career, although fans were shocked, according to Thompson, the decision was exactly what she needed.\n\n“I want to have a family one day and just enjoy every experience of that and be there for every single moment. That’s the most important for me. I’ve only known golf as my life. So it’s nice to branch out and be able to enjoy other things,” she said in a statement after she announced her retirement in 2024.\n\nWith Thompson trying to soak in the essence of life, fans soon had their voices heard online.\n\nIn the Instagram post, Thompson shared how she has spent quality time with her friends. Witnessing the lavish celebration, one fan noted, “Well, that looks like fun, and you look gorgeous and so happy\n\n.” Another fan, too, echoed the same thoughts and wrote, “Looks like fun! Congratulations & enjoy the moment\n\nWith just weeks left for the D-Day to arrive, good wishes have already started pouring in for the LPGA golfer. One such comment read, “SOO Many congratulations\n\nLexi. Wonderful to see you happy\n\n”. Another fan chimed in, “Congratulations, Lexi.”\n\nAs Thompson had taken a break from the competitive realm by taking a semi-retirement, and fans would not be getting to see the star play in all the calendar events, one golf enthusiast mentioned, “Going to miss seeing you on the course this season.”\n\nThus, with things looking rosy for the 30-year-old, fans cannot wait to see her enjoy life to the fullest post her marriage.\n\nThe post Lexi Thompson Turns Heads at Her Bachelorette Party as Wedding Preps Begin Amid LPGA Hiatus appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

    "description": "Senegal beat Morocco to claim their second Afcon title despite walking off the pitch after a late penalty award which also sparked chaos in the stands.",
    "fullText": "Pape Gueye's extra-time goal was enough to seal a second Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) title for Senegal, after chaotic scenes at the end of normal time saw the West Africans walk off the pitch and Brahim Diaz miss a penalty for Morocco in the 24th minute of injury time.\n\nThe lengthy delay came after the spot kick was awarded via the intervention of the video assistant referee (VAR), sparking angry scenes on the touchline and in the crowd, with Senegal fans clashing with security after attempting to break on to the pitch.\n\nAfter waiting so long to take his penalty, Diaz was under immense pressure, having been handed the chance to end his country's 50-year wait to lift the Afcon trophy with essentially the final kick of the game, but his decision to chip the ball down the middle backfired horrendously as Edouard Mendy was able to stand his ground and collect in embarrassingly simple fashion.\n\nAfter 90 minutes which were largely devoid of obvious goalscoring opportunities, the unsavoury scenes at the end were a poor advert for African football, especially with Morocco talking up this tournament as a test event for co-hosting the 2030 Fifa World Cup.\n\nChances did come at both ends after Gueye's strike four minutes into extra time, but the closest Morocco came to an equaliser was when Nayef Aguerd powered a header against the bar from a corner.\n\nAnd as the rain poured down in Rabat, Morocco's dream of a first continental crown since 1976 was washed away in dramatic fashion.\n\n'An ambassador for African football' - Mane is Senegal's Afcon hero\n\nSenegal walk off in Afcon final over penalty award\n\nSenegal were understandably jubilant at the end, having somehow found a way to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, but the sight of celebrating players being separated from their supporters by massed ranks of police in riot gear said everything about the way this game finished.\n\nHaving won a first title by beating Egypt on penalties at the 2021 edition, many of the same players returned here for a second bite of the cherry, including talisman Sadio Mane, who has hinted heavily that this will be his last appearance at an Afcon.\n\nBut unlike in Cameroon, this time the Teranga Lions were up against the hosts and the fiery atmosphere inside the impressive Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium.\n\nA first-ever meeting between the two teams at a finals saw Morocco edge proceedings in the first half, but Senegal have the best openings.\n\nYassine Bounou made a good scrambling save at his far post to keep out Gueye's goalbound header from a corner, while the African goalkeeper of the year also denied Iliman Ndiaye with a trailing leg.\n\nThe start of the second half saw a fired up Morocco exert greater dominance, pinning back their opponents, but still struggling to create clear-cut chances.\n\nIn fact, the Atlas Lions got lucky at the start of injury time when Ismaila Sarr nodded the ball into the net after Abdoulaye Seck's initial header came back off the woodwork after a corner.\n\nHowever, referee Jean Jacques Ndala had already blown his whistle, awarding a very soft foul for contact between Seck and Morocco captain Achraf Hakimi.\n\nBut that was just the start of the drama, as what followed will inevitably be what this game is remembered for.\n\nWith eight minutes having originally been added on, Ndala was advised by VAR to check a tug by West Ham defender El Hadji Malick Diouf on Diaz from a corner, with the Congolese deciding to award the spot kick.\n\nWhat started out as fierce complaints by the Senegalese players quickly descended into chaos on the touchline as both benches emptied onto the pitch.\n\nHaving gone head-to-head with opposite number Walid Regragui, Senegal coach Pape Thiaw called his players down the tunnel, while West African fans, some wielding metal chairs, also attempted to fight their way on to the playing surface.\n\nFollowing a lengthy delay, with Mane the only Teranga Lions player who looked truly uncomfortable with the walk-off, everyone returned to the pitch and Diaz was finally able to take his penalty for what should have been a celebratory moment for his country.\n\nBut with history beckoning, the Real Madrid man tried to showboat with a Panenka and paid the price in a way which he is unlikely to ever forget.\n\nMorocco, Africa's top team in the world rankings, came into this tournament feeling like they had a date with destiny.\n\nFor more than a decade, King Mohammed VI has poured huge sums of money into the game, using it as a tool for societal and cultural change, a move which resulted in the Atlas Lions becoming the first African nation to reach a World Cup semi-final at Qatar 2022.\n\nBut this Afcon was supposed to be their crowing achievement, the moment to end a long trophy drought stretching back to 1976.\n\nInstead, they become just the fourth hosts to lose in a final - having seen the past 12 who have reach the showpiece end up as champions.\n\nThe moment which broke their hearts came from Villarreal man Gueye, a towering midfield presence who has been one of the tournament's standout players.\n\nHaving burst forward from just inside the Moroccan half, he shrugged off a tired-looking challenge from Hakimi just outside the box and smashed a left-foot rocket into the top right-hand corner, clipping the underside of the bar as it went in.\n\nMorocco did their best to fight back, with substitute Youssef En-Nesyri stooping to head just wide at the near post 10 minutes after Gueye's goal and Aguerd's header off the bar following in the second half of extra time.\n\nBut Senegal also had chances to extend their lead, with Paris St-Germain teenager Ibrahim Mbaye's slaloming run and shot blocked by a lunging Hakimi and Cherif Ndiaye denied by a brilliant double save from Bounou.\n\nAt the other end, Mendy was being bombarded with missiles thrown by fans behind his goal, with one invader making it onto the pitch next to the former Chelsea stopper before security managed to force him away.\n\nThe recriminations over the way in which this game ended will go on for some time - but Senegal are unlikely to care.\n\nIf this is to be Mane's final Afcon he has bowed out in style, and the sight of him being hoisted on to the shoulders of his team-mates, trophy in hand and having had the captain's armband thrust upon him, will hopefully last longer.",

    "description": "After the NFL regular season was spiced by debate over calls made or missed by the officials, it’s only natural for the playoffs to have such drama.",
    "fullText": "Even worse for the heartbroken Buffalo Bills as Ja’Quan McMillian ripped the football away from Brandin Cooks for the interception that gave the Denver Broncos new life in overtime of the Jan. 17 AFC divisional playoff game was the sight of back judge Scott Helverson instantly signaling a turnover.\n\nRather than a 39-yard completion that could have set up a potential game-winning field goal, the Bills saw victory snatched from their grasp in a hail of controversy.\n\nThe ruling from New York – where the NFL reviews all turnovers from its officiating command center at league headquarters – didn’t make it better for the Bills Mafia.\n\nAnd it will linger as another symbol of frustration for a franchise that has come up short again in its quest to get back to the Super Bowl.\n\n“It’s hard for me to understand why it was ruled the way it was ruled,” Bills coach Sean McDermott said during an emotional postgame news conference after the Broncos advanced to the AFC championship game with a 33-30 victory.\n\nSorry, Buffalo. It wouldn’t be the NFL without some sort of officiating controversy. After the dramatic regular season was spiced by several cases that inflamed debate over calls made or missed by the officials, it’s only natural for the playoffs to come wrapped with such drama.\n\nThe Bills – plus armchair quarterbacks, ex-players, informed analysts, internet influencers and probably others – maintained that Cooks should have been ruled down by contact after hauling in the rainbow throw from Josh Allen that traveled 55 yards in the air. Cooks and McMillian tumbled to the turf and rolled over with the nickel back emerging with the football.\n\nReferee Carl Cheffers explained that Cooks never had possession of the football as he crashed to the turf.\n\n“The defender is the one that completed the process of the catch, so the defender was awarded the ball,” Cheffers said in the Pro Football Writers Association (PFWA) pool report.\n\nMaybe so. Yet that hardly addresses the inconsistency that is often at the heart of debate concerning the calls or non-calls by NFL officials.\n\nHow many times have we seen a receiver barely touch the ground with a knee hitting the turf – as Cooks did – and getting credit for the catch?\n\nSure, there’s always a different perspective with freeze-frame video versus real-time eyesight. That’s part of what the officiating experts – in New York and on the field – undoubtedly have to process.\n\nIn any event, for Bills fans, the would-be catch by Cooks is their version of the “Dez Bryant caught it” controversy that dogged the Dallas Cowboys after the receiver’s apparent catch was ruled incomplete in an NFC divisional playoff loss at Green Bay in January 2015.\n\nOf course, McMillian wonders what the fuss is about.\n\n“I don’t really think he had complete control going down,” he said. “We were both fighting for the ball. I just made a play and basically took it out of his hands and came up with it.”\n\nAdding to Buffalo’s consternation were the two pass interference calls against Taron Johnson and Tre’Davious White, for 17 and 30 yards, respectively, that set up Wil Lutz’s chip-shot winning field goal.\n\nBlame the refs? Cheffers’ crew couldn’t be blamed for the DPI calls – Johnson pulled on Courtland Sutton’s arm as Bo Nix’s pass arrived. White hit intended target Marvin Mims, Jr. early – even in a game where it appeared the officials were not necessarily calling it tight.\n\nStill, you may never convince the Bills – stung in last year’s playoff by a questionable spot on an Allen run in crunch time of the AFC title game loss a Kansas City – that McMillian’s interception should have stood.\n\nMcDermott was unable to challenge the ruling for two reasons. All turnovers and scoring plays are automatically reviewed in New York at any point in the game. Besides, it was overtime, when coaches are unable to challenge a play as all replay reviews are initiated in New York.\n\nStill, credit McDermott for his next-best, last-gasp option: He called a timeout and requested a quick chat with Cheffers, who told him the turnover was confirmed in New York.\n\n“It was a rather rapid unfolding of the review, if there was a review, and so I called a timeout to try to slow it down,” McDermott said. “It would seem logical to me and make a lot of sense that the head official would walk over and want to go and take a look at it. Just to make sure that everybody from here who is in the stadium, to there (in New York) are on the same page. That’s too big of a play, in my estimation, too big of a play in a play that decided the game, potentially … to not even slow it down. That’s why I had to call the timeout.”\n\nThe controversy, nonetheless, will live on. Scrutiny on officials will likely intensify during the offseason as the NFL engages in negotiations with the union for officials as the expiration of their labor pact looms.\n\nSean Payton gets it. The Broncos coach had his own moment of officiating controversy in a high-stakes game during his tenure with the New Orleans Saints. A non-call of pass interference near the goal line stung New Orleans during an overtime loss to the Los Angeles Rams during the 2018 NFC Championship Game at the Superdome.\n\nHad the Broncos not survived on Sunday, Payton might have some sort of flashback – and surely been livid about an apparent missed call in overtime. Early on Buffalo’s final possession, it appeared that a holding call was missed as Allen threw from his end zone. A flag would have resulted in a safety.\n\n“A phenomenal play by ‘J-Mac,’” Payton said of McMillian’s interception. “But it should’ve ended really with a safety, which would’ve been the first in the history of football.”\n\nA playoff game ending on a penalty would have surely ignited some controversy.\n\nHey, there’s always next weekend.\n\nContact Jarrett Bell at jbell@usatoday.com or follow on X: @JarrettBell\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Bills vs Broncos interception controversy explained",

    "fullText": "Senegal's Africa Cup of Nations final match-winner Pape Gueye said his team had been fuelled by a sense of injustice after a controversial penalty award for Morocco which led to ugly scenes had almost cost them the title.\n\nThe match at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat was still goalless deep in injury time at the end of normal time when Morocco were awarded a spot-kick following a VAR check for a challenge on Brahim Diaz.\n\nAlready furious at having a goal disallowed at the other end for a soft-looking foul minutes earlier, Senegal reacted angrily to the decision and some of their players walked off the pitch in disgust.\n\nMeanwhile trouble broke out in the stands as some Senegalese fans tried to enter the field of play and became involved in fighting with security personnel.\n\nThe game was held up for almost 20 minutes before Diaz could take the penalty, and his weak kick was saved by Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.\n\nGueye then went on to score a brilliant goal in the fourth minute of extra time to give his team a 1-0 win and hand them the trophy.\n\n\"We had a feeling of injustice. Just before the penalty we thought we should have had a goal and the referee didn't go to VAR,\" said Villarreal midfielder Gueye, who added that Sadio Mane had urged the team to come back onto the pitch for the penalty.\n\n\"Sadio told us to come back on and we remobilised. Edouard then made the save, we stayed focused, got the goal and won the game.\"\n\nSenegal coach Pape Thiaw said he had told his team to walk off in the first place because they disagreed with the penalty decision, but he admitted that he should not have done so.\n\n\"After thinking about it, I realised that I shouldn't have asked them to go off. I apologise for that,\" Thiaw told French broadcaster beIN Sports.\n\n\"Sometimes you can react in the heat of the moment. Before that we scored a goal that was not given. But now we accept that referees do make mistakes and we apologise.\"\n\nIt was Senegal's second Cup of Nations title, four years after they claimed their first in Cameroon with a penalty shoot-out win in the final against Egypt.\n\nThe Lions of Teranga have also twice been runners-up, and remarkably Gueye's goal was the first Senegal have ever scored in four AFCON final appearances in total.\n\n\"We are very happy with the victory tonight,\" said Gueye, who pointed out that three Senegal players -- including regular starting right-back Krepin Diatta and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Pape Matar Sarr -- had been last-minute withdrawals from the final.\n\n\"We feel pride. We wanted to win tonight. We all saw what happened at the end of the match but we took the decision to come back onto the pitch and give everything, which we did.\"",

    "fullText": "Two English women’s teams became the first to pass £20million in annual revenues last season, according to the latest iteration of Deloitte’s Football Money League report.\n\nThe annual undertaking ranks football clubs worldwide by revenue, based on figures from the most recently completed season. The 2026 version, incorporating financials from 2024-25, is the fourth time Deloitte has included a women’s team ranking in a report that is now into its 29th year of publication.\n\nArsenal, who won the Champions League in May, topped the women’s listing for the first time, with revenues of £21.5m (€25.6m). Domestic rivals Chelsea trailed just behind (£21.3m), with the London clubs leaping above Barcelona Femeni (£18.5m), who led the way in 2023-24.\n\nThe report reflects continued revenue growth in women’s football, but there are caveats. For one, the United States, home to a slew of valuable women’s teams, is excluded. A note from Deloitte detailed the consultancy firm’s inability to obtain relevant information from clubs in the U.S., as well as other key women’s football markets, such as Australia and Sweden.\n\nAlso worth mentioning — and it applies to the men’s version of the report, too, which will be published later this week — is that an appearance on Deloitte’s list does not equate to financial stability. High revenues don’t necessarily equal profits. The report’s limited focus on turnover, alongside the fact that most clubs are yet to disclose last season’s accounts, means we don’t know what the world’s most prominent women’s teams spent on wages and the likes.\n\nChelsea had the third-highest revenues in 2023-24 at £11.5m, yet turned those into a deficit of £8.4m, a loss margin of 73 per cent. It is not yet known which women’s teams ran tight ships last season.\n\nEven allowing for those limitations, the report shows a clear driving force behind growing revenues in the women’s game: commercial income.\n\nOf the £132.2m collectively generated by the 15 highest-earning clubs in 2024-25, £95.8m came from commercial revenue streams. At 72 per cent of overall income, commercial earnings were more than double matchday and broadcast revenues combined. Eleven of the 12 clubs to disclose their splits of revenue and appear in this and last year’s lists enjoyed improved commercial income.\n\nThe largest growth, and the largest commercial income in women’s football, arrived at Chelsea, who more than doubled the revenue stream to £16m. That followed the internal sale of Chelsea Women to another business within the BlueCo sphere.\n\nThe transaction helped Chelsea’s men’s team comply with Premier League profitability and sustainability rules, a factor which was widely seen as the primary motive. Yet at the time of the reorganisation in May 2024, Chelsea said they hoped to “harness the full potential of the opportunity for women’s football” and, based on these latest figures, there are signs of them doing that.\n\nPer Deloitte’s report, that £16m commercial revenue was “driven by both attributions from club-wide sponsorship deals, as well as exclusive partnerships with major brands”. The latter was in evidence in July 2024 when Three, the telecommunications company, became the club’s first women’s-only principal partner, and other exclusive sponsorships have followed. D.Louise became the club’s first official jewellery partner in May 2025, followed four months later by Here We Flo, a period care brand.\n\nArsenal, too, boasted big commercial revenue last year, albeit there are questions around the origin of some of that amount. Per previous accounts for Arsenal Women, revenue includes ‘group income’, a figure which includes a support fee paid from the men’s team to the women’s to cover costs incurred. The Athletic does not have the 2024-25 accounts yet, but since the arrangement was introduced in June 2019, Arsenal Women have basically broken even every year, in part because the ‘revenue’ provided by the wider group is used.\n\nThat support fee is included in Deloitte’s commercial income figure, but it is unclear how much it comprised last season or previously. Per the basis of preparation note in the report, Deloitte advises the group income amount within Arsenal’s £13.6m commercial revenue “includes, among other components, revenue attributable to the women’s club from full club-wide commercial agreements, and revenue contributions from the men’s club”.\n\nAs with the men’s team, Emirates are Arsenal Women’s front-of-shirt sponsor and Adidas manufacture the kit. Those and other lead partners such as Sobha Realty and Visit Rwanda presumably make up the bulk of the commercial figure, but with no way of splitting the sum into revenue from external sources and that support fee, it is unclear how big Arsenal’s true commercial earnings are — or whether removing the support fee would see them fall from the top of the overall revenue list.\n\nTaken at face value, the commercial incomes of Chelsea and Arsenal’s women’s teams were higher than Sheffield United and Luton Town managed in the Premier League in 2023-24. Moreover, Arsenal’s £13.6m is higher than the most recent commercial income than 19 men’s EFL Championship clubs; for Chelsea, their £16m was higher than 21 clubs from the men’s second tier.\n\nIf there are question marks about their commercial figure, where Arsenal undoubtedly led the was in matchday income, with the £5.9m they earned from the gate more than six men’s EFL Championship clubs, per most recently available figures. It was close to double the second-highest women’s matchday income figure last season (Barcelona: £3.3m), and spoke to Arsenal’s using data analytics to appeal to attendees.\n\nNine of 11 Women’s Super League (WSL) home games were played at the Emirates Stadium, drawing average crowds of more than 34,000 and a high of 56,748 for the North London derby with Spurs last February. All 11 of Arsenal’s home league games will be played at the Emirates in 2025-26.\n\nGrowth at the gate was far from uniform, though, and after a record-breaking year of attendances in 2023-24, five WSL teams saw average gates drop. Nowhere was that more evident than at Manchester United, where a fall in attendances of a third led to a similar proportionate reduction in gate receipts.\n\nMatchday growth as a whole across the sampled clubs (excluding Paris Saint-Germain, who didn’t provide a split of revenues for last year’s edition) was just £3m, albeit that still represented a 19 per cent rise given the lowly starting point. The increase was, however, largely driven by a couple of outliers, principally Arsenal and Bayern Munich.\n\nGrowth was even more anaemic when it came to broadcast income, which stagnated as existing TV deals continued and performance-based payments offset between clubs. Lowly money from broadcast income highlights a stark juxtaposition between the women’s and men’s forms of the game. Where in the latter, hefty TV rights drove a surge in incomes and a focus on commercial revenues came later, for women’s teams, it is sponsorship deals and partnerships doing the heavy lifting.\n\nWSL teams will benefit from a new TV deal that began this season, but for the highest earners, commercial deals will remain the largest revenue driver.\n\nIn terms of league of origin, the women’s game has quickly come to mirror the men’s: the richest clubs primarily derive from England. Eight of the top 15 are from the WSL, the same number as in 2023-24.\n\nMade clear from this latest release of figures is the gulf between those at the top of women’s football and the rest. Arsenal and Chelsea surpass £20m, Barcelona are not too far off, then there is a big gap to the two Manchester clubs and Real Madrid, each of whom just topped £10m. Beyond them, the fall-off is even greater.\n\nThe revenue of women’s football’s top earners was double that of the fifth-highest earning club, and 4.8 times that of the 10th team on Deloitte’s list, Tottenham Hotspur. That dispersion of revenue has grown since 2023-24, when the highest earner generated 3.9 times the 10th-placed side.\n\nRevenue dispersion: high earner v 10th\n\nSuch disparity might sound familiar to the men’s form, but while the differences in monetary terms are far smaller, the dispersion as a multiple is higher in the women’s game. When Arsenal Women’s revenue was 4.8 times higher than Spurs last season, the huge earnings of Real Madrid in the men’s game were only 1.9 times higher than 10th-placed Chelsea in 2023-24. We will have to wait until later this week to see the men’s dispersion level for last season.\n\nRevenues in women’s football are plainly growing, and it should not be forgotten that the sport remains in almost a start-up stage. Jennifer Haskel of Deloitte’s Sport Business Group advises “the shift from the start-up phase to the established phase requires consistent time, investment and effort to develop the foundations in the right manner”.\n\nThat much is clear, and this report highlights the obvious need for women’s teams to improve matchday and broadcast incomes. Women’s teams are capitalising effectively on commercial markets men’s teams have historically not appealed to — generating more money from viewership, in person and on the sofa, is now an obvious target area.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nArsenal, Chelsea, NWSL, Sports Business, Women's Soccer\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "The AFC’s divisional round matchup between the Houston Texans and New England Patriots will likely go down as the most brutal game of this year’s playoffs. By the time each team had reached their locker room for the halftime break, there had already been a total of six turnovers committed, and neither C.J. Stroud nor Drake Maye were able to find much comfort in the pocket.\n\nNew England’s sophomore sensation endured five sacks and fumbled twice throughout the first three quarters of play, but in the end, he was still able to find Kayshon Boutte for a game-clinching 32-yard touchdown pass at the top of the fourth. Maye’s ability to overcome adversity on a routine basis has seen him draw several comparisons to his predecessor, Tom Brady, throughout the past several months.\n\nAccording to the team’s owner, Robert Kraft, there are “a lot of similarities” between the two of them that extend well beyond the football field. “They both have a sense of humility, and they are understated,” Kraft explained during his pregame appearance with NFL ESPN.\n\n“I saw Drake last year, when we had that horrible record, he did something that Tommy did in the locker room in the early years. He used to go around to every offensive lineman, even after we had a bad loss, and make, in a genuine way, make them feel he really respected what they did. Drake is such an understated, humble, young man. He comes from a great family. He married his seventh-grade sweetheart.”\n\nIn the eyes of Kraft, the best way to describe the former Tar Heel is by using the words “genuine” and “real.” If you were to ask the oddsmakers out in Las Vegas, however, they’d likely tell you that the term “Most Valuable Player” is more applicable.\n\nHaving led the league in completion percentage, yards gained per pass attempt, and passer rating, the 23-year-old closed the 2025 regular season as a slight underdog to Matthew Stafford for the regular season MVP award, but now that he’s headed to the AFC Championship, the only thing that’s on his mind right now is extending the dynasty that Brady built.\n\nFollowing their 28-16 win over the Texans, the Patriots saw their odds of winning the Super Bowl improve to +250, making them the second-largest favorite to win it all this year. The Seattle Seahawks continue to be the odds-on favorite, but seeing as the Denver Broncos will be without their QB1, Bo Nix, for next week’s match-up, New England figures to have the easiest remaining path to the title game.\n\nThat’s right, believe it or not, the Patriots are back in the conference championship for the first time since 2018. It won’t seem fair to all of the other fan bases out there, but it’s times like these where we are reminded that the gridiron doesn’t care about your feelings, and neither does Drake Maye.\n\nNew England will return to play on January 25th at Empower Field at Mile High on January 25th at 3:00 pm EST.\n\nThe post “He Married His Seventh-Grade Sweetheart”: Robert Kraft Finds ‘A Lot’ Of Similarities Between Drake Maye and Tom Brady appeared first on The SportsRush.",

An emotional Kyren Wilson is cutting a dejected and disconsolate figure in the dark and grey bowels of the York Barbican.\n\nNot only has he had family health issues to contend with, but a difficult campaign has been compounded by being forced to change the cue that he used to win the world title in 2024 - after it was damaged in a \"freak accident\".\n\nThe Englishman even says he was close to having a \"mental breakdown\" during his last-32 defeat by Elliot Slessor at the UK Championship - just last month.\n\nThen fast forward just six weeks to images of Wilson pouring out of Alexandra Palace on Sunday, as he lifted the Paul Hunter Trophy and celebrated his maiden Masters triumph with his family.\n\n\"It's amazing. Father Christmas was very kind to me,\" said Wilson, who auctioned off his beloved old cue for a children's cancer charity, raising £5,250.\n\n\"It was a complete freak accident, what happened to my cue, so there are no bad feelings there but it is so important to have something you can trust out there.\"\n\nArmed with a suitable replacement, Wilson, 34, made it third time lucky when he became the 26th winner of the Masters, having twice previously been defeated in the final.\n\nHis route to glory and a second Triple Crown title took him past Si Jiahui, Neil Robertson, Wu Yize and finally four-time world champion John Higgins, who is widely regarded as one of the game's greatest players.\n\n\"I'll be honest I thought at the UK Championship I was gone, I honestly didn't know if I was ever going to be back in the winners' enclosure,\" Wilson added.\n\n\"I have such a supportive family and I promised my mum she was going to have that bit of crystal [Masters trophy] on her dining room table.\n\n\"People don't see what happens behind closed doors but I was in a bad way at the UK - really, really suffering.\n\n\"To pick up a new cue and, after one month, to go and win the second biggest major is an incredible achievement.\"\n\nWilson defeats Higgins to claim first Masters title\n\nMasters results and previous winners",

    "fullText": "Jan Jensen and the No. 11 Iowa Women’s basketball team (15-2,6-0 B1G) begin their toughest stint of the season tonight, starting things off with a home matchup against the No. 15 Michigan State Spartans (17-1, 6-1 B1G). This stretch is going to be absolutely brutal, with the team’s games coming against Maryland, Ohio State, USC and UCLA. How they split these games could end up being the difference between Iowa hosting and not for the NCAA Tournament, so at least 2 wins here would be ideal, making tonight’s game one of the most important to win.\n\nIt will be challenging though, as Michigan State’s only loss was a stunner, losing to Wisconsin on the road in early December. The team always manages to play Iowa hard, and tonight should be no exception. Let’s hope the home court advantage helps for the Hawkeyes. They’ll need strong performances once again from Hannah Stuelke, Ava Heiden, and Chit-Chat Wright to have their best shot at the win.\n\nIt will be interesting as well to see how freshman Addie Deal follows up her career-high 18 point performance against Oregon on Thursday night. If she can consistently score in what is sure to now be an expanded role, she adds another dimension to this Iowa squad that has, at times, struggled with shot creation.\n\nEmely Rodriguez is once again out for Iowa.\n\nShould be a great game. I won’t be around too much in the comments as I’ll once again be at the game, but be respectful, have fun, and cheer us on to victory. I’ll have a post up sometime this week as well.\n\nDate: January 18, 2026\nTime: 7 p.m. CST\nMatchup: No. 11 Iowa Hawkeyes vs. No. 15 Michigan State Spartans \nLocation: Carver-Hawkeye Arena – Iowa City, IA \nTV: Big Ten Network",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New England Patriots punched their ticket to the AFC Championship on Sunday, January 18, with a hard-fought 28-16 victory over the Houston Texans. In a game defined by a relentless Foxborough snowstorm, Mike Vrabel’s squad overcame a turnover-heavy first half to secure the franchise's first conference title berth since 2019.\n\nThe matchup lived up to its billing as a defensive slugfest. While the Texans’ top-ranked unit made life difficult for Drake Maye, forcing him into four fumbles, the Patriots’ defense proved even more opportunistic. New England feasted on a record-tying four interceptions from C.J. Stroud, including a crucial Marcus Jones pick-six that swung the momentum for good. Despite the sloppy conditions, Maye’s three touchdown passes provided the necessary spark to push the Patriots past a Houston team that had dominated the Wild Card round.\n\nWith the win, the Patriots now look ahead to a high-stakes trip to higher altitudes next Sunday, January 25. Now, a new generation takes the stage as the Patriots aim to rewrite history and claim the all-time postseason wins record for themselves.\n\nHere is more on who the Patriots play next in the 2026 NFL playoffs.\n\nNFL divisional round picks, predictions\n\nRanking eight teams remaining in 2026 NFL playoffs\n\nNFL divisional round picks against the spread\n\nWith the win, the Patriots move on to the AFC Championship, facing the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Broncos squeaked past the Buffalo Bills and Josh Allen, automatically getting home-field advantage for the AFC Championship Game. Mile High is certainly no easy place to play, and Denver earned the right to host by clinching the No. 1 overall seed. Though Denver suffered a brutal blow when starting quarterback Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury.\n\nThe matchup carries heavy foreshadowing. The last time these two storied franchises met in the AFC Championship was exactly a decade ago in January 2016. That legendary \"Mile High\" battle served as the final postseason chapter of the Tom Brady vs. Peyton Manning rivalry — a game the Broncos won 20-18 on their way to a Super Bowl title.\n\nThis time around, with a new quarterback at the helm, New England is searching for revenge.",

ESPN's NFL Live crew, for example, all picked the Texans in an incredibly amusing segment on the show this week.\n\nAs expected, the picks backfired tremendously and the Patriots cruised to the AFC Championship.

    "fullText": "The PWHL season is nearing the midway point and what has become abundantly clear is that teams falling behind are looking to make moves.\n\nThe only trade to date in this PWHL campaign came on the eve of the regular season when the Vancouver Goldeneyes sent Denisa Krisova to Minnesota in exchange for Anna Segedi.\n\nThere were a trio of trades on PWHL Draft day as well with New York swapping players with Toronto and Montreal, and Toronto and Vancouver also making a deal.\n\nAs the league standings continue to take shape, familiar trade partners could be in the mix again.\n\nVancouver came out of the expansion process with a roster that looked completely stacked with talent. What’s transpired since has been a run of underwhelming performances for the Goldeneyes, and the belief that despite a wealth of talent on their team, the mix isn’t working.\n\nWith Nina Jobst-Smith returning, followed by the return of Sarah Nurse, both coming back from injuries, the Vancouver Goldeneyes have experienced a influx to their roster.\n\nVancouver however, also has a group of players vastly underperforming from previous seasons who have seen their ice time on the decline as well. It's a long list for the Goldeneyes that could involve Brooke McQuigge, Michela Cava, Emma Greco, Izzy Daniel, and others.\n\nGeneral manager Cara Gardner Morey has been active in her early stages as a general manager making multiple deals, and another sounds like it's in the works.\n\nVancouver is certainly in the mix for an imminent trade.\n\nEveryone in the PWHL is open for business right now. The Ottawa Charge are believed to remain active on the trade market as they've been since the league was founded. General manager Mike Hirshfeld has made bold moves before such as a deal bringing in Jocelyne Larocque.\n\nOne area of need for the Charge remains their blueline where the Charge lack depth. With the loss of Shiann Darkangelo and Tereza Vanisova in the offseason however, secondary scoring in Ottawa has also been a concern. It's an issue that's been magnified by the early season struggles of Emily Clark, Katerina Mrazova, and Gabbie Hughes, as well as the transition time it's taking Anna Shokhina and Fanuza Kadirova to acclimatize to North America.\n\nThe Toronto Sceptres are another team who could be involved in a deal in the near future as the Sceptres continue to struggle to find chemistry both up front and on the blueline. Gina Kingsbury has pulled off multiple blockbuster deals including sending Larocque to Ottawa for Hayley Scamurra and Savannah Harmon, and the deal that brought Ella Shelton to Toronto at the draft. Kingsbury also has history with Vancouver making a draft day deal sending Kristen Campbell out west.",

    "fullText": "The USC women's basketball team ended a four-game losing streak by dominating Purdue 83-57 at Galen Center on Sunday.\n\nUSC guard Kennedy Smith returned to the court after missing three games while recovering from a lower leg injury.\n\nThe Trojans (11-7, 3-4 Big Ten) built early offensive momentum and opened up an 11-point lead against Purdue (10-8, 2-5), setting a strong tone during the first half.\n\nUSC maintained control by scoring nine points to start the second quarter before a foul on Vivian Iwuchukwu sent Purdue forward Lana McCarthy to the free-throw line, where she recorded the Boilermakers’ first points of the period.\n\nThe Trojans responded with a three-pointer from Kara Dunn, continuing to apply pressure on the offensive end.\n\nAlthough Purdue found a rhythm and cut into the deficit, the Boilermakers were unable to take the lead and the Trojans entered halftime with a commanding 42–27 advantage.\n\nUSC’s offense remained consistent throughout the second half, converting scoring opportunities and following through on shots as the Trojans maintained control of the game.\n\nPurdue guard Tara Daye led the Boilermakers with 21 points and 10 rebounds. Kiki Smith added 15 points, while Avery Gordon finished with 10 points and six rebounds.\n\nFor USC, Dunn delivered a standout performance with 29 points and five rebounds. Jazzy Davidson was limited to three points in the first half, but the freshman star found her rhythm after halftime and finished with 13 points and six assists.\n\nLondynn Jones added 15 points, and Iwuchukwu contributed seven points and four rebounds.\n\nUSC will try to build on its win during a grueling Big Ten stretch, with games at No. 15 Michigan State Thursday, at No. 8 Michigan next Sunday and at home against No. 11 Iowa on Jan. 29.\n\n In your inbox every Monday morning.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "The Boston Celtics will have some tough decisions to make ahead of the Feb. 5 trade deadline",
    "fullText": "To begin the season, most Boston Celtics fans assumed Anfernee Simons would be used as a trade chip on or near the Feb. 5 NBA trade deadline. Simons joined Boston as part of the deal that sent Jrue Holiday to the Portland Trail Blazers. The talented scorer is in the final year of his current contract and will become an unrestricted free agent in the summer.\n\nHowever, as the season has worn on, Simons has become a key member of the Celtics' rotation. He's grown into his role as the team's sixth man and currently ranks third in the NBA for total points off the bench. Due to his consistent impact, it's looking increasingly unlikely that Stevens parts with Simons before the trade deadline, and potentially looks to re-sign him during the summer.\n\nThe problem is, if Simons isn't part of a trade, Boston's chances of landing a high-level difference-maker will take a considerable hit. That issue only grows if you expect Sam Hauser to also be off limits. With all that in mind, Jack Simone and Sam LaFrance recently discussed the tough decisions Brad Stevens is facing in the coming weeks during an episode of the \"How 'Bout Them Celtics\" podcast.\n\nYou can watch the full podcast episode by clicking on the embedded video above.\n\nWatch or listen to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSpotify: https://bit.ly/40JRevf\n\nApple: https://apple.co/45sAUBG\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf\n\nThis article originally appeared on Celtics Wire: The Celtics face a trade deadline dilemma",

    "fullText": "There's just over a week until the Feb. 5 trade deadline, and Boston Celtics fans will be patiently waiting to see whether Brad Stevens decides to make a move. This season was supposed to be a gap year; however, Joe Mazzulla's coaching style has seen Boston emerge as a genuine contender in a wide-open Eastern Conference. Therefore, there are some sections of the fanbase that would like to see the Celtics become buyers before Feb. 5.\n\nThe Celtics need some additional talent at the center position, or someone who can play both the four and the five. Of course, Mazzulla must also prepare for the eventual return of Jayson Tatum, whether that be this season or next. Tatum is currently sidelined due to an Achilles tendon injury.\n\nDuring a recent episode of the \"Hardwood Knocks\" podcast, hosts Dan Favale and Bleacher Report's Grant Hughes discussed the impending trade deadline and what we can expect to see from the Celtics. Will Stevens take a big swing? Will he look to get the Celtics under the luxury tax apron? Or, is Boston set to stand pat and see how far the current roster can take them?\n\nYou can watch the full podcast episode by clicking on the embedded video above.\n\nWatch or listen to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSpotify: https://bit.ly/40JRevf\n\nApple: https://apple.co/45sAUBG\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf\n\nThis article originally appeared on Celtics Wire: What can Celtics fans expect ahead of the trade deadline?",

    "fullText": "With each passing couple months, the chances that Conor McGregor ever will fight in the UFC get slimmer and slimmer.\n\nThat's not something the former fighter or his fans likely ever would admit, or the UFC brass, for that matter, but that's just the cold, hard math.\n\nAnd if a person purporting to be McGregor is to be trusted, there may be another hint now available about his future. On a video game live stream, a person who claimed to be McGregor and sounded like the Irishman said because of the UFC's new broadcast deal with Paramount+, which eliminated the traditional pay-per-view model, his contract is, in essence, void and needs to be reworked.\n\nThat, the purported McGregor said, will take place in February.\n\nConor McGregor said he has to negotiate a new contract with the UFC next month 👀\n\n“My contract is essentially void right now.” pic.twitter.com/c7wVzFEkIG\n\n— Happy Punch (@HappyPunch) January 18, 2026\n\nIn July, it will be five years since McGregor (22-6 MMA, 10-4 UFC) last fought. He broke his leg in a second straight loss to Dustin Poirier at UFC 264. He coached Season 31 of \"The Ultimate Fighter\" opposite Michael Chandler (23-10 MMA, 2-5 UFC) and was supposed to fight him, but that never has come to fruition despite Chandler desperately pining for it, and McGregor consistently teasing it. UFC CEO Dana White recently took it off the table nearly entirely.\n\nSunday, the former UFC fighter continued his years-long spiral with a lengthy proclamation that he once again has seen the light – this time thanks to a hallucinogenic treatment in Mexico.\n\nThis past November, McGregor said he saw his own death, when it was going to happen, and how it would impact the four children he has with Dee Devlin, whom he recently married after years together. Then, he said, Jesus descended from heaven and put a crown on his head to save him during a hallucinogenic treatment in Mexico..\n\n\"To God, I am yours,\" McGregor posted on social media. \"Thank you for bestowing upon me this incredible blessing that I take with great care and absolute seriousness! I live my life per your word and nothing more.\"\n\nLast year, McGregor dropped out of a bid to become the next president of Ireland. He couldn't get support to even get his name on the ballot, so he wasn't actually in the race. McGregor has said he aspires to political office in the near future and has taken up a nationalistic right-wing rallying cry similar to Donald Trump in that pursuit. Like Trump, McGregor has multiple sexual assault accusations against him, and like Trump, a ruling against him for one, too.\n\nMcGregor was found liable for the 2018 sexual assault of Nikita Hand in a Dublin hotel. Then McGregor lost his appeal to have the decision reversed. After that, McGregor made a plea to his countrywomen and countrymen to stand with him in the wake of the mountain of civil and criminal charges against him over the years, and the civil rape and sexual assault trial that came home to roost. A poll found that just 7 percent of people said they would vote for McGregor to be president of Ireland.\n\nMcGregor also is part-owner of the BKFC and his appearances at those events are regular.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Conor McGregor purportedly says UFC contract void in Paramount era",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are one victory away from the Super Bowl following Sunday’s 28-16 win over the Houston Texans.\n\nNew England advanced to the AFC Championship Game in a sloppy, turnover-filled triumph over Houston. Following consecutive home wins, the Patriots will travel to Denver to face the Broncos for the conference title.\n\nAfter New England’s victory, the NFL announced the details for next weekend’s matchup. The Patriots will play the Broncos on Sunday, Jan. 25, at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nCBS will televise the AFC Championship Game, and viewers can also stream it on Paramount+.\n\nThe Patriots finished the regular season third in total offense, but their defense has carried them to double-digit playoff wins. They first sacked Justin Herbert six times in a 16-3 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers before locking down the Texans in the AFC Divisional Round.\n\nHouston averaged just 3.3 yards per play, gaining a mere 48 rushing yards on 22 carries. Making matters worse, C.J. Stroud threw four interceptions — one returned for a touchdown — and lost a fumble.\n\nThe Patriots will look to improve to 9-0 on the road when playing the Broncos, who survived a 33-30 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills. But the AFC West champions suffered a huge loss in the process, as quarterback Bo Nix broke his ankle at the end of the game.\n\nThat places former Patriots reserve Jarrett Stidham in line to make his fifth career start. The former fourth-round pick has a 78.3 passer rating with eight touchdowns and eight interceptions.\n\nJason Kelce Celebrates ‘Pitbull’ Patriots Defensive Standout",

She won Adelaide playing probably the best tennis of her life, came in here super confident.\n\n“Whereas she’s had a lot of injuries, she’s had an iteration to her service motion again. So I just think that she just doesn’t quite have the same confidence she had last year.\n\n“So I just don’t see her defending her title this year. I see Amanda [Anisimova] being the one who gets through there.”\n\nKeys lifted the trophy in Adelaide before the 2025 Australian Open, where she claimed her maiden Grand Slam title.\n\nAt this year’s Adelaide International, the American beat Tereza Valentova before losing her quarterfinal to Victoria Mboko.\n\nAnother player Stubbs was tasked with discussing was Naomi Osaka, who like Keys is a former Australian Open champion.\n\nShe has, however, won the Grand Slam twice and is a four-time Grand Slam champion in total, while she is also a former world number one.\n\nBut Stubbs said of Osaka: “Look, I just think again, she just doesn’t have the tennis under her belt that she needs coming in here.\n\n“Can she beat anyone on any given day? Absolutely. Naomi Osaka is a four-time champion of a major title.\n\n“She knows how to win them. But everyone is so good now, and she has to get more tennis under her belt.\n\n“I just don’t think she’s quite there enough to beat an Iga Swiatek or an [Elena] Rybakina or any of these players. But then again, who knows? We know she’s capable.

    "fullText": "Sadio Mane was the hero for Senegal once again, but not for the reasons you would expect.\n\nThe former Liverpool and Bayern Munich forward claimed his second Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) crown on Sunday, with the Teranga Lions beating host nation Morocco in a final filled with controversy.\n\nIn stoppage time, Senegal head coach Pape Thiaw tried to usher his team off the field after Morocco were awarded a penalty in the 98th minute when defender El Hadji Malick Diouf brought down Brahim Diaz.\n\nWith the Senegal players back in the changing rooms, Mane was pictured entering and then ushering them back out on to the pitch, with the help of goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.\n\nRoughly 16 minutes after the spot-kick was awarded, Diaz's Panenka penalty was easily caught by Mendy in a nightmare moment for one of the stars of the tournament.\n\nAt 0-0 the game went to extra time. Pape Gueye rocketed in a winner and sealed a dramatic title.\n\nMane, who has said this will be his last Afcon, goes out as a leader - having been presented with the captain's armband by his team-mates before the trophy was lifted.\n\nHe told African media: \"Yes, it was I who convinced the team to return to the field.\n\n\"The players and the coach had decided to withdraw, and I didn't understand that decision, but finally, I told everyone to return immediately and to play no matter the cost.\"\n\nFormer Nigeria forward Daniel Amokachi told BBC World Service: \"Mane went the extra mile to get his team back and it has paid off.\n\n\"What an ambassador for football he is. We know the kind of person he is off the pitch and he knows what football is all about.\"\n\nFormer Morocco international Hassan Kachloul said \"Africa football and world football were losing\" until Mane intervened.\n\n\"What I like more than anything, the only player from the Senegalese team was Sadio Mane,\" he told E4.\n\n\"That shows the great man he is. He went back to the dressing room and brought those players back. Mane was the man to bring them back on.\"\n\nSenegal walk off in Afcon final over penalty award\n\nAfcon 2025: Senegal are champions after final descends into chaos\n\nFor Mane, it all started in Bambali.\n\nIt was in south-west Senegal that he began playing football on its red earth-lined streets and sandy pitches and where, aged 13, he watched Liverpool's famous comeback against AC Milan in the Champions League final in 2005.\n\nSince then he has gone on to lift both that prestigious trophy and the Premier League with the Reds, as well as claiming two Afcon titles with the Teranga Lions.\n\nMane scored the winning penalty against Egypt in the final of the 2021 edition and described it as \"the best day of my life and the best trophy of my life\".\n\nA stadium was named after him in the city of Sedhiou, just under 20km from his hometown, following that triumph as a recognition of his achievements.\n\nNow a two-time champion and 33 years old, Mane has capped off his Afcon career on an ultimate high.\n\nBut Gueye says the squad aim to convince Mane, who he called \"a legend of Senegal\", to change his mind about this being his final Afcon and remain with the team for at least the 2027 edition in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.\n\n\"We're going to try to keep him with us a bit longer, because he still has some great years to give,\" the 26-year-old Villarreal man told BBC Afrique.\n\n\"I heard what he said and we'll see what he decides to do. But we really want him to stay with us for many more years.\"\n\nMane, now plying his trade in Saudi Arabia with Al-Nassr, may have a glittering trophy cabinet but he has never forgotten his roots.\n\nHe won hearts with charitable acts in Bambali by pledging money to build a hospital and school, contributing to the construction of mosques and providing funds to aid the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHe also sent 300 Liverpool shirts to his hometown before the Anfield club's appearance in the 2018 Champions League final, which Real Madrid ultimately won 3-1.\n\n\"If Sadio comes here, he behaves very humbly, on a level with the people in Bambali,\" Fode Boucar Dahaba, the president of a regional league, told BBC Sport Africa on a visit to the village a few years ago.\n\n\"He doesn't want to stand out. The village gives all this love back to him.\"\n\nFamily members describe him as someone who is \"working for everybody\" and a \"good Muslim\".\n\nThat was evident during his time in England's top flight, when he helped clean the toilets at a mosque in Toxteth after one Liverpool victory.\n\n\"He wanted to remain discreet and wasn't doing it for publicity,\" said Abu Usamah Al-Tahabi, the imam at Al Rahma Mosque.\n\n\"He's not a person looking for fanfare. There's no arrogance.\"\n\nSenegal centre-back Moussa Niakhate hailed Mane as \"an incredible man\" in the lead-up to the final.\n\n\"I won't have enough time to describe what Sadio represents for African football, and more particularly for the Senegalese people,\" he added.\n\nMane has over 120 caps and is his country's record goalscorer with 53 goals.\n\nHe has so often been the hero on the pitch in recent years, and he intends to play at the World Cup later this year, where more great memories could be made.\n\nHe had an early penalty kick saved during the first half of the 2021 Afcon final but stepped up again to decide the shootout with Egypt in Yaounde.\n\nA little over a month later he settled their 2022 Fifa World Cup play-off against the Pharaohs in the same way - after that match also went the distance - although he ultimately missed out on the tournament in Qatar through injury.\n\nHe has mainly been a creative force at this year's Afcon finals, but his 78th-minute strike against Egypt, who were once again on the receiving end of Mane's magic, proved enough to send the Teranga Lions through to the final.\n\n\"That's what we expect from him,\" midfielder Idrissa Gana Gueye told the BBC World Service after his decisive intervention in Tangier on Wednesday.\n\n\"[He is] a big player and he needs to show it in big games. He showed it again.\"\n\nMane may have a humble demeanour and does not captain Senegal, but when he speaks his team-mates take note.\n\n\"In his pre-match speech [before playing Egypt] he motivated all of us,\" Pape Gueye said.\n\n\"He had the right words to make sure we went into the match fully focused.\n\n\"He has the experience of big matches, so he also knows how to calm us down. You can see it a lot in his gestures - he tells us to stay calm, even after we score or if we concede a goal.\"\n\nMane won the vast majority of his international caps under Aliou Cisse, who was in charge of the West Africans from 2015 to 2024, but current coach Pape Thiaw is understandably keen for his talisman to remain part of the national set-up.\n\n\"I think he made his decision in the heat of the moment and the country does not agree, and I as coach of the national team do not agree at all,\" Thiaw said.\n\n\"We would like to keep him for as long as possible.\"\n\nAll you need to know about Afcon 2025",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich’s Konrad Laimer spoke to the Bundesliga’s website in a recent interview. As part of the interview, he was asked what phase of his career he was in right now — both on the pitch and and from a personal perspective. @MiaSanMia recorded what he had to say to the league.\n\nThe Austrian international talked about getting older and what he has experienced. He responded with, “It’s always a bit tougher at a certain age. I’m 28, I’ve already experienced a fair bit. I’ve already played quite a few games and, yes, time always seems to pass so quickly. I actually still feel very young. You do notice that you’re a bit older, but it’s fun. I feel great and I feel I have many, many years left in me.”\n\nLaimer went on to talk about he can do to continue to play. “The most important thing is to look after your body. That’s a good thing when you’ve been playing football for a few years. I know what suits me, I know what doesn’t suit me. I know what I need, even during long weeks with tough games, to perform at 100 percent. At the moment, everything feels really, really good.”\n\nLaimer has a lot to look forward to at the moment. Bayern is clicking in all three competitions while Austria is prepping for a tough World Cup group. While Argentina will be the toughest, Argentina will have a great chance to move on to the knockout rounds. Laimer has a chance to be a pivotal part of both team’s successes.",

    "fullText": "Senegal beat Morocco to win the Africa Cup of Nations for a second time - but only after the final was overshadowed when they temporarily refused to play after the hosts were awarded a controversial stoppage-time penalty with the match goalless.\n\nVillarreal midfielder Pape Gueye scored the only goal in the fourth minute of extra time to seal a second triumph in five years for the Lions.\n\nBut the game was marred by late controversy as Senegal head coach Pape Thiaw tried to usher his team off the field when Morocco were awarded a spot-kick in the 98th minute as a result of defender El Hadji Malick Diouf bringing down Brahim Diaz.\n\nThough when the penalty was eventually taken in the 114th minute, Real Madrid forward Diaz saw his Panenka attempt saved by Edouard Mendy.\n\nIn his post-match press conference, Morocco coach Walid Regragui said Senegal's actions were \"shameful\" and do not \"honour Africa\".\n\nThiaw, meanwhile, saw his media briefing cancelled after a ruckus broke out in the press room.\n\nBut in an interview with BeIN Sport, he accepted that he should not have ordered his team off the field.\n\n\"We didn't agree,\" he said. \"I don't want to go over all the incidents. I apologise for the football.\n\n\"After reflecting on it I made them come back [on the pitch] - you can react in the heat of the moment. We accept the errors of the referee.\n\n\"We shouldn't have done it but it's done and now we present our apologies to football.\"\n\nThiaw, 44, was furious with referee Jean Jacques Ndala - who awarded the penalty after reviewing the incident on the VAR monitor - for ruling out a goal for his side moments earlier.\n\nCrystal Palace forward Ismaila Sarr had bundled home from close range, but his effort was chalked off for a foul by Abdoulaye Seck on Achraf Hakimi.\n\nAs several of the Senegal players followed Thiaw's request to leave the field, a section of their supporters threw objects and attempted to get on the field.\n\nSenegal only returned from the dressing room at the request of former Liverpool forward Sadio Mane.\n\nGueye then scored the only goal of the game with a stunning individual effort in the 94th minute.\n\nDiaz, substituted in the extra time, was left crestfallen as Morocco missed the chance to win a first Afcon title since 1976.\n\nAfter the game, Mendy insisted he was \"proud\" of the way Senegal - instructed by Mane - returned to the field to win their second Afcon title this decade.\n\n\"What did we say to each other? That's between us,\" said Mendy.\n\n\"We did it together and we came back together, that's all that matters. We can be proud tonight.\"\n\nMatch-winner Gueye added: \"We had a feeling of injustice. Just before the penalty we thought we should have had a goal and the referee didn't go to VAR.\n\n\"Sadio [Mane] told us to come back on and we remobilised. Edouard [Mendy] then made the save, we stayed focused, got the goal and won the game.\"\n\n'An ambassador for African football' - Mane is Senegal's Afcon hero\n\nDiaz will 'have nightmares' over Panenka failure\n\nAfcon 2025: Senegal are champions after final descends into chaos\n\nIt's an awful way for a tournament which had felt like such a great advert for African football to end.\n\nI couldn't believe the chaos I was witnessing from the commentary box, with some fans trying to get on to the pitch to my left and members of staff being separated down below me in the technical areas.\n\nThen the Senegal players walking down the tunnel. It was a terrible look for the Cup of Nations.\n\nIf I look back at the past few weeks covering this event there has been a huge amount of debate - more than most years - about refereeing decisions and VAR, with accusations from some journalists and fans that hosts Morocco were getting the rub of the green from some officials.\n\nIt even got to a point where refereeing appointments for certain games were becoming a talking point on social media, which put a lot of pressure on the officials before certain games.\n\nSenegal's complaints about the way they'd been treated leading up to the final - including what they felt was a lack of security when they arrived in Rabat on Friday and their lack of tickets - also increased the tension going into this game.\n\nNobody expected the scenes we witnessed after the penalty was awarded though, and this was all in front of the Fifa president Gianni Infantino who was here to present the trophy to the winning side.\n\nMorocco have been praised for the way they've organised this tournament - including from the big names like Mohamed Salah - with impressive infrastructure, stadiums and travel links.\n\nSadly for them though, with four years to go until they co-host the World Cup, the astonishing scenes before the Diaz penalty will probably be what will be most remembered about this tournament.\n\nThere is very little positive to say about the end of this game, but one person to come out of it well is Mane.\n\nHe was the one Senegal player who clearly did not want to walk down the tunnel and was telling his team-mates to come back out.\n\nHe also walked over to the Senegal fans after the full-time whistle, begging them to calm down.\n\nThere is now a line of armoured police in front of those fans to my left. It's been quite violent down there on several occasions.\n\nBefore Sunday's final in Rabat, the Senegal Football Federation (FSF) expressed \"serious concerns\" over the security of the team.\n\nThe 2021 winners were swarmed by fans when the team bus arrived in the Moroccan capital on Friday.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, the FSF also complained about the conditions of the hotel, number of tickets allocated to supporters and the fact that they were not offered a training pitch at Morocco's team base.\n\nThey said a \"lack of adequate security\" left players and staff \"at risk\".\n\n\"What happened yesterday was not normal,\" said Thiaw in his pre-match news conference.\n\n\"Given the number there, anything could have happened. My players could have been in danger.\n\n\"That type of thing should not happen between two brother countries.\"\n\nFormer Nigeria forward Efan Ekoku criticised Thiaw and his players, insisting their temporary refusal to play was \"not a good look for African football\".\n\n\"It [the penalty award] was soft,\" Ekoku told E4. \"It was foolish and reckless by El Hadji Malick Diouf, but the decision had been made and the players have to abide by that.\n\n\"You cannot do that [leave the pitch]. However aggrieved you feel at it you have got to let the referee and the rules [make the decision]... I have got some sympathy, but this is not a good look.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria's 2013 winner John Obi Mikel said he could \"understand the frustration\" but walking off is \"not what I want to see\".\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Brahim Diaz had the chance to win Afcon for Morocco, but his choice to try a Panenka ended up costing his side dearly as Senegal hit back to win the game in extra time.",
    "fullText": "It was a moment that will haunt Brahim Diaz for years to come.\n\nThe winger had a chance to write his name into Moroccan folklore after winning a penalty in the eighth minute of second-half added time with Africa Cup of Nations final against Senegal goalless.\n\nIt was a golden opportunity to end his country's 50-year wait to lift the Afcon trophy.\n\nBut Diaz, whose five goals had propelled the hosts to the final, tried a 'Panenka' chipped penalty. It backfired. Horrendously so. Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy stood his ground and caught the ball in embarrassingly simple fashion.\n\nThe former Manchester City player and tournament's top-scorer looked distraught as it began to sink in what he had done. Later, television cameras zoomed in on him on the Morocco bench, after he had been substituted in extra time, holding back tears.\n\nThe Real Madrid attacker had been made to wait around 17 minutes to take the kick after the majority of Senegal's players, including Mendy, marched off the pitch in protest at the award of the penalty.\n\n\"He had a lot of time before taking the penalty which must have disturbed him,\" said Morocco manager Walid Regragui.\n\n\"But we can't change what happened. That is how he chose to take the penalty. We need to look forwards now.\"\n\nDiaz's penalty turned out to be the last kick of normal time.\n\nFour minutes into extra time, Senegal's Pape Gueye lashed in what turned out to be the winner to leave Diaz and his Morocco team-mates heartbroken.\n\n\"I think Brahim Diaz is going to have a lot of nightmares in the coming days,\" former Morocco midfielder Hassan Kachloul said on Channel 4's coverage of the match.\n\nFormer Nigeria forward Daniel Amokachi added: \"Brahim Diaz threw away all of his glorious moments, scoring five goals in this tournament.\"\n\nAnd ex-Nigeria midfielder Jon Obi Mikel said the miss \"spoils everything Brahim Diaz has done well in this tournament\".\n\n\"He is going to be devastated,\" he added. \"This is going to be tough on him, for weeks, for months.\"\n\nEfan Ekoku, another former Nigeria international, said: \"It is a moment Brahim Diaz will never get over.\"\n\nSenegal win Afcon after chaotic final against Morocco\n\nSenegal walk off in Afcon final over penalty award\n\nAfcon 2025 podcast: Senegal are champions after final descends into chaos\n\nThe final was goalless deep into added time at the end of the second half when Diaz El Hadji Malick Diouf appeared to drag Diaz to the ground by his neck.\n\nDR Congo referee Jean-Jacques Ndala was sent to the pitchside monitor by the video assistant referee and, after a quick check, pointed to the penalty spot in the 98th minute.\n\nAlready incensed after a decision to disallow a Senegal goal in the 93rd minute, head coach Pape Thiaw tried to usher his team off the field, and several Senegal players left for the dressing room.\n\nFormer Liverpool striker Sadio Mane stayed on the pitch and tried to coax his Senegal team-mates back on to finish the match.\n\nWhen the penalty was eventually taken in the 114th minute, Diaz saw his tame attempt saved by Mendy.\n\nPape Gueye put Senegal in front four minutes into extra time. A few minutes later Diaz was substituted.\n\nThe last time Morocco won Afcon was the same year the first Panenka penalty was attempted.\n\nCzechoslovakia beat West Germany in the Euro 1976 final with probably the most famous penalty kick in history. During the shootout, midfielder Antonin Panenka waited for the goalkeeper to dive and then casually chipped the ball down the middle of the goal.\n\nSince the original, the 'Panenka' has been repeated and proven as a bona-fide - if high-risk - tactic by some of the biggest names on the most momentous occasions.\n\nZinedine Zidane scored one for France in the 2006 World Cup final, beating Italy keeper Gianluigi Buffon with an effort that went in off the crossbar.\n\nAndrea Pirlo cooly clipped one past Joe Hart as Italy beat England on penalties in the Euro 2012 quarter-final. Sergio Ramos followed suit as Spain knocked Portugal out of the semi-finals of the same tournament.\n\nLionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Thierry Henry, Neymar and Zlatan Ibrahimovic have all pulled it off.\n\nBut Diaz isn't the only player to see their attempt backfire on football's biggest stage. Zidane and Pirlo both missed Panenka's earlier in their career. Sergio Aguero, Raheem Sterling and Peter Crouch have all tried and failed.\n\nIn January, Brentford goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher made light work of an attempt in the Premier League by Sunderland's Enzo Le Fee.\n\nAdemola Lookman's dreadful attempt with the last kick of the game in a 1-0 defeat by West Ham in 2020 is up there with one of the worst Panenka penalties seen in recent years.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "It's been an amazing season for the Denver Broncos, who rode a 14-3 record to the No. 1 seed in the AFC and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Denver held on for a 33-30 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills in an instant classic in Saturday's divisional round game. Unfortunately, starting quarterback Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury in the extra frame and will be out for Denver's next game against the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship.\n\nThat means that backup QB Jarrett Stidham will get his first playoff start.\n\nDrake Maye led the Patriots — aided by five C.J. Stroud interceptions — to a 28-16 win over the Texans to earn a date in Denver.\n\nOddsmakers are making the Broncos historic home underdogs.\n\nDenver opened as a 4.5-point home underdog at BetMGM on Sunday night, which had already been pushed up to -5.5. That would be the biggest home underdog for a No. 1 seed in a conference championship game since at least 1970, per Sports Odds History. The total was set at 40.5 points.\n\nIt's Denver's first appearance in an AFC title game since 2016.",

    "fullText": "Brahim Diaz was left in tears after his fluffed ‘Panenka’-style penalty cost Morocco their first Africa Cup of Nations title in 50 years in a chaotic final against Senegal.\n\nThe Real Madrid midfielder contentiously won the spot-kick deep into second-half stoppage time with the game still goalless, giving the Atlas Lions a golden opportunity to snatch the continental crown.\n\nHowever, Senegal responded to the VAR verdict by staging a walk-off in protest, with manager Pape Thiaw ordering his players back into the dressing room in a 16-minute hiatus.\n\nWhen the Senegalese players were finally persuaded to re-emerge from the tunnel by talisman Sadio Mane, Diaz stepped up to the plate to take the spot-kick, only for goalkeeper Edouard Mendy to speak persistently to the 26-year-old to further delay the penalty.\n\nDiaz then inexplicably went for a ‘Panenka’ in the 24th minute of stoppage time and his weak penalty sailed tamely into the arms of Mendy.\n\nWith the game forced to extra time as a result, Pape Sarr went on to score the winner in stunning fashion for Senegal in the 94th minute, with his rocket of an effort proving the difference and denying the tournament hosts a first Afcon title since 1976.\n\nThe midfielder, who was substituted early into extra time, was seen in tears at full-time and looked completely dejected as he received the golden boot award from Fifa president Gianni Infantino, with his tally of five goals enough to see him end the tournament as top scorer.\n\nMendy was asked about his encounter with Diaz before the penalty was taken, replying: \"What did we say to each other? That's between us. We did it together and we came back together, that's all that matters. We can be proud tonight.”\n\nNigeria legend John Obi Mikel was left fearing the impact the performance could have on the player, who has seen an otherwise fantastic Afcon campaign ruined.\n\n“To do that it spoils everything Brahim Diaz has done well in this tournament. He is going to be devastated. This is going to be tough on him, for weeks, for months,” Mikel told E4.\n\n“Again, it is a shame to see. Brahim Diaz has had a superb tournament. He scored five goals and he has been the star man. It is sad to see him do such a thing. Just put your foot through it.”",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots continued their remarkable turnaround this season by beating the Houston Texans 28-16 to reach the AFC Championship game.\n\nAfter winning just four games in his rookie season, quarterback Drake Maye led the Patriots to a 14-3 record and an unexpected play-off appearance.\n\nThe 23-year-old is a leading contender to be named the NFL's Most Valuable Player and overcame both snow and the vaunted Texans defence to win Sunday's Divisional Round game in Massachusetts.\n\nThat secured the Patriots' first AFC Championship game since 2019, when legendary quarterback Tom Brady and New England claimed their sixth Super Bowl victory.\n\nHouston's defence was ranked as the NFL's best this season and although the Texans claimed their first play-off win on the road last week, they have suffered a third straight exit at this stage.\n\nThe Patriots will be on away territory next week as they travel to face the Denver Broncos, the AFC's top seed, for a place in Super Bowl 60 on Sunday, 8 February.\n\nNFL play-offs: Patriots reach AFC Championship game, Rams v Bears to come\n\nMike Vrabel was Brady's team-mate for three of those Super Bowl wins and in his first season as New England's head coach, the Patriots claimed 10 more wins than in 2024 - tied for the biggest turnaround in NFL history.\n\nThe Patriots have been one of this season's best all-round teams, claiming the AFC's second seed and their first AFC East division title in seven years in Brady's last season in New England.\n\nIn Maye, the Patriots have finally found Brady's long-term successor. He is a year younger than the record seven-time Super Bowl winner was when he claimed his first NFL title in 2002, and in this match, the quarterback again showed a maturity beyond his years.\n\nBoth he and opposite number CJ Stroud struggled with the wintry conditions and Maye had four fumbles, two of them resulting in turnovers. He also had one interception and was sacked five times by Houston's fearsome pass rush.\n\nHowever, he also delivered three touchdown passes, two of them to help establish a 21-10 lead at half-time and the latter a 32-yard deep shot in the fourth quarter to Kayshon Boutte, who made a superb one-handed grab to seal victory.\n\nMeanwhile, after throwing just eight interceptions in 14 games during the regular season, Houston's third-year quarterback Stroud had four interceptions in the first half alone, with one of them returned for a touchdown by Marcus Jones.\n\nIronically, Maye will now go up against Jarrett Stidham, who was initially seen as Brady's successor when drafted in 2019 and was back-up for the legendary quarterback's final season in New England.\n\nAfter joining Denver in 2023, 29-year-old Stidham is now set for only the fifth start of his NFL career because Broncos' first-choice quarterback Bo Nix suffered a broken ankle in their Divisional Round win over Buffalo on Saturday.\n\nConference seed in brackets, all kick-off times GMT\n\nLos Angeles Rams (5) @ Chicago Bears (2) - 23:30\n\nAFC Championship: New England Patriots (2) @ Denver Broncos (1) - 20:00\n\nNFC Championship: Rams or Bears @ Seattle Seahawks (1) - 23:30\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "Heart Rate Variability",
    "description": "Your heart rate variability (HRV) is a powerful metric of your overall health. HRV measures the difference in time between each heartbeat, which fluctuates slightly. High HRV is generally considered better. Low HRV can be caused by medical conditions, stress, or intense fitness training.",
    "fullText": "Your heart rate variability (HRV) is a powerful—if complex—metric of your overall health. Your Apple Watch automatically measures HRV, including while sleeping. We’ll try to give an overview here, but you could really write a whole book on what HRV means.\n\nA healthy heart is not a metronome: as your heart beats, the timing between each beat shifts slightly. For example, one heart beat may come 900 millseconds after another, and then the next one 950 millseconds after that. That’s healthy and good.\n\nYour HRV measures the variation in time between these heart beats. The unit of HRV is millseconds, and a normal HRV is 18-76ms.\n\nWhile HRV is derived from heart rate, it’s actually a broader window into your overall health.\n\nThe main influence on HRV is your autonomic nervous system (ANS). Since your ANS is connected to your liver, kidney, stomach, brain, and more, HRV is actually a really powerful metric of many different organ systems in your body. We’ll cover the autonomic nervous system more below, including the how HRV sometimes reflects medical conditions like anxiety, depression, dysautonomia, digestive tract problems, and more.\n\nAnything between 18 to 76 ms is a normal heart rate variability. Within 18-76ms, higher HRVs are usually better.\n\nDepending on age and sex, below 18 ms is a low HRV. This is around the bottom 10%. An HRV above 76 ms would put you in the 90th percentile of Apple Watch users.\n\nThe Apple Watch measures the time of each heart beat using its optical heart rate sensor. Apple Watch calculates HRV using SDNN: the standard deviation between normal-to-normal heart beat intevals.\n\nSDNN is defined mathematically as:\n\nSDNN = sqrt(Σ(NN_i - mean(NN))² / (N - 1))\n\nHere’s an example. Let’s say your heart is beating around 60bpm. The spacing between heart beats isn’t going to be exactly 1 second—it will vary a little bit, beat to beat. Let’s say the first heart beat comes, then a second one 1040 ms later, then a third heart beat 960 ms later, then a final heart beat exactly 1000ms later. Your NN intervals are then 1040ms, 960ms, and 1000ms.\n\nYour average N-N (normal to normal) interval is 1000ms. The standard deviation is 32.6 ms. That means your HRV\nis 32.6 ms, using the SDNN method. Other wearables like Whoop use different formulas for HRV, such as RMSSD, which we’ll explain now.\n\nThere are several formulas to calculate HRV. The two most common are SDNN (used by Apple Watch) and RMSSD:\n\nHRV is influenced by your autonomic nervous system, which has two branches: the sympathetic nervous system (your “fight or flight” response) and the parasympathetic nervous system (your “rest and digest” response, which is controlled by the vagus nerve). When the sympathetic nervous system dominates, HRV is lower. When the parasympathetic nervous system dominates, HRV is higher.\n\nA low or high HRV can have many meanings and causes, including mental health, dysautonomia, diabetes, or simply stress. Let’s go\nthrough each potential cause.\n\nA common cause of temporary low HRV on your Apple Watch is stress or intense fitness training. However, medical conditions\ncan also cause low HRVs (or high HRVs). The most common conditions that affect HRV are dysautonomia, anxiety, depression, nerve damage, abnormal heart rhythms, and some gut health conditions.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of dysautonomia is imbalance between the sympathetic nervous system (often overactive) and the parasympathetic nervous system (often withdrawn). People with dysautonomia, POTS, and Long Covid often haver low HRV. While HRV itself is not used in diagnosis of POTS, the pattern of heart rate and blood pressure when going from laying to standing is. You can book an appointment with an Empirical Health doctor\nto get POTS testing and treatment.\n\nLow HRV can sometimes be a sign of depression or anxiety. Improving HRV through practices like mindfulness, physical activity, stress management, and medication can support better emotional regulation and mental health.\n\nNerve damage (for example, from diabetes) can cause low HRV. Nerve damage affects HRV by disrupting the balance and communication between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. When nerves responsible for these regulatory pathways are damaged, the body’s ability to adjust heart rate in response to stressors and environmental changes becomes impaired. This leads to a decrease in HRV.\n\nFinally, very low or high HRV can also be caused by an electrical problem in the heart (for example, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or supraventricular tachycardia). In these cases, an ECG can give more diagnostic information on exactly what is happening in the heart’s electrical system.\n\nThe image above shows two common abnormal heart rhythms, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, on an ECG. Atrial fibrillation is highly irregular, leading to high HRV. Atrial flutter is very regular, leading to no or low HRV. Either of these rhythms require attention from a medical professional.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 4 and above include an FDA-cleared ECG sensor that can help distinguish whether low or high HRV is caused by an abnormal heart rhythm. The current Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 9 (released in 2025) both include the ECG sensor, but not\nthe Apple Watch SE3.\n\nSince the vagus nerve is connected with your stomach, intenstines, liver, and so on, low HRV can sometimes be correlated with problems in the digestive tract.\n\nBecause HRV correlates with so much in the body, it’s a powerful metric but doesn’t give specific diagnostic information on exactly what’s wrong. If you have concerns or questions about HRV, it’s best to talk with a doctor about your specific medical situation. You can book an appointment through the Empirical Health app.\n\nWhat is HRV and what does it have to do with health?\n\nRaquel Rodriguez Martinez, MD, MPP\n\nYour guide to Apple Watch's heart rate monitor",

    "fullText": "CAIRO (AP) — A dividing line, at times invisible, can mean life or death for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThose sheltering near the territory's “yellow line” that the Israeli military withdrew to as part of the October ceasefire say they live in fear as Israeli soldiers direct near-daily fire at anyone who crosses or even lingers near it.\n\nOf the 447 Palestinians killed between the ceasefire taking effect and Tuesday, at least 77 were killed by Israeli gunfire near the line, including 62 who crossed it, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Among them were teenagers and young children, The Associated Press found.\n\nAnd although the military has placed some yellow barrels and concrete barriers delineating the limits of the Palestinian zone, the line is still unmarked in certain places and in others was laid nearly half a kilometer (0.3 miles) deeper than what was agreed to in the ceasefire deal, expanding the part of Gaza that Israel controls, according to Palestinians and mapping experts.\n\n“We stay away from the barrels. No one dares to get close” said Gaza City resident Ahmed Abu Jahal, noting that the markers are less than 100 meters (110 yards) from his house — instead of the roughly 500 meters (546 yards) outlined in a map put out by the Israeli military.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the military had acknowledged killing 57 people around the yellow line, saying most were militants. It said its troops are complying with the rules of engagement in order to counter militant groups, and are informing Palestinians of the line’s location and marking it on the ground to “reduce friction and prevent misunderstandings.”\n\nUnder the ceasefire, Israel withdrew its troops to a buffer zone that is up to 7 kilometers (4 miles) deep and includes most of Gaza's arable land, its elevated points and all of its border crossings. That hems more than 2 million Palestinians into a strip along the coastline and central Gaza.\n\nPeople of all ages, some already dead, have been showing up almost daily at the emergency room of Gaza City's Al-Ahli hospital with bullet wounds from straying near the line, said hospital director Fadel Naeem.\n\nAmid the vast destruction in Gaza, the demarcation line often isn't easy to detect, Naeem said. He recounted picking his way through undamaged paths during a recent visit to the southern city of Khan Younis. He didn't notice he was almost across the line until locals shouted at him to turn back, he said.\n\nThe Israeli military said most of the people it has killed crossing the line posed a threat to its troops. According to a military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military rules, troops issue audible warnings and then fire warning shots whenever someone crosses the line. Many civilians retreat when warning shots are fired, though some have been killed, the official acknowledged.\n\nKilled while playing near the line\n\nZaher Shamia, 17, lived with his grandfather in a tent 300 meters (330 yards) from the line in northern Gaza’s Jabaliya refugee camp. On Dec. 10, he was playing with his cousin and some friends near the line, according to video he took before his death.\n\nSuddenly, shots rang out and the video stopped. Soldiers approaching the line with an armored bulldozer had fired on the teens, hitting Zaher, said a witness.\n\nA neighbor eventually found Zaher’s body, which had been crushed by the bulldozer, said Zaher's grandfather, Kamal al-Beih: “We only recognized him from his head.\"\n\nTwo doctors, Mohamed Abu Selmiya and Rami Mhanna, confirmed that the teen had been killed by gunshots and then run over by a bulldozer. The military official said he was aware that Shamia was a civilian and that the military was looking into it.\n\nMaram Atta said that on Dec. 7, her 3-year-old daughter, Ahed al-Bayouk, was playing with siblings outside of their tent, which was near the yellow line along Gaza's southern coast. Atta was preparing lentils when she heard aircraft overhead, then shots.\n\nA stray projectile whizzed close to her and struck Ahed, who was dead before they reached the clinic.\n\n“I lost my daughter to what they keep calling a ‘ceasefire’” said Atta, crying. “What ceasefire are they talking about?”\n\nA military official denied the killing.\n\nThe line's exact location is ambiguous, differing on maps put out by the Israeli military and the White House.\n\nNeither matches the line troops appear to be marking on the ground, according to Palestinians and geolocation specialists.\n\nChris Osiek, an open source intelligence analyst and consultant, has geolocated a number of yellow blocks based on social media videos. He found at least four urban areas where troops set the blocks several hundred meters deeper into Gaza than the military map-specified yellow line.\n\n“This is basically what you get when you simply let Trump make an image and post it on Truth Social and let the IDF make their own,” he said, using the acronym for the military. “If it’s not a proper system, with coordinates that make it easy for people to navigate where it is, then you leave the ambiguity free for the IDF to interpret the yellow line how they basically want.”\n\nThe military official dismissed such criticism, saying any deviations from the map amount to just a few meters. But to Palestinians hemmed in by widespread destruction and displacement, every few meters lost is another house that can't be sheltered in — another they doubt will ever be returned.\n\n‘The line is getting very close’\n\nUnder the ceasefire, Israeli forces are only supposed to remain at the yellow line until a fuller withdrawal, though the agreement doesn't give a timeline for that. With the next steps in the deal lagging and troops digging into positions on the Israeli side, though, Palestinians wonder if they are witnessing a permanent land takeover.\n\nIn December, Israel’s defense minister described the yellow line as “a new border line — serving as a forward defensive line for our communities and a line of operational activity.”\n\nThe military has continued leveling buildings inside the Israeli-held zone, turning already damaged neighborhoods to moonscapes. Almost all of the city of Rafah, on Gaza's border with Egypt, has been razed over the past year. The army says this is necessary to destroy tunnels and prepare the area for reconstruction.\n\nIn some places, demolitions since the ceasefire have encroached beyond the official yellow line. Since November, troops have leveled a swath of Gaza City’s Tuffah neighborhood extending some 300 meters (330 yards) outside the Israeli-held zone, according to Oct. 14 and Dec. 18 satellite photos provided by Planet Labs.\n\nAbu Jahal moved back to his damaged house in Tuffah at the ceasefire's start. He said he frequently saw new yellow barrels appear and the military forcing out anyone living on its side of the markers.\n\nOn Jan. 7, Israeli fire hit a house near him, and the residents had to evacuate, he said. Abu Jahal said his family — including his wife, their child, and seven other relatives — may also have to leave soon.\n\n“The line is getting very close,” he said.",

    "fullText": "China is now a key market for global carmakers, and, surprisingly, buyers there are shifting back to sedans that offer serious tech. Automakers are pushing boundaries to get noticed, and Nissan is one of them. The brand launched two new electrified sedans and a refreshed Teana late last year – the latter being the more premium take on the Altima sold in the US.\n\nThe new Teana, built by Dongfeng Nissan, puts a big emphasis on tech and interior quality. It looks a class above what you’d expect from an Altima-based sedan. Part of that comes from a glowing AI speaker on the dash, but the real surprise is the material choice. Nissan worked with Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (MCC) to use Durabio, a plant-based plastic that looks and feels closer to crystal than the usual trim.\n\nIn China, buyers care about big screens, lighting, and how upscale a car feels. The Teana’s interior is built to make a strong first impression, and it stands out even more when you see it lit up at night.\n\nDurabio is more than just a marketing fluff. MCC developed it as a bio-based plastic using plant-derived isosorbide. It’s clearer and handles light better than regular polycarbonate, which helps create lighting that looks deep and high-end instead of cheap or artificial.\n\nOn the Teana, Durabio is used for the inverted-pyramid AI speaker that lights up with six pillars glowing in up to 256 colors. The material refracts light cleanly, giving it a crystal-like look without needing a clear coat. That saves manufacturing steps, lowers environmental footprint, and still meets automotive durability standards.\n\nTeana runs a Huawei-based operating system to go with Durabio. The end result is an interior that feels modern and thoughtfully put together (at least visually), not just a quick update.\n\nMeanwhile, the US-market Altima heads into 2026 with almost no changes from last year. It remains affordable and practical, but next to the Teana, it comes across as very restrained. Nissan still sells a lot of sedans in the US, with over 255,000 units last year (out of the brand's over 760,000-unit sales), but the Altima’s own sales dropped to 93,268 in 2025, down 18 percent from the year before.\n\nThat drop probably comes from the Altima’s age. The current model dates back to 2018, with its last big update in 2022. It no longer stands out for design or interior appeal. After seeing what Nissan has done with the Teana, it’s fair to ask (hope, even) if a more upscale, more distinctive Altima could bring buyers back to the midsize sedan segment.\n\nFor now, there’s no clear answer. But with China getting the more ambitious upgrades, it’s easy to see how a bit of that Durabio-inspired thinking could only help the Altima.\n\nView the 9 images of this gallery on the original article",

    "fullText": "A fight broke out at Knott’s Berry Farm in Orange County Saturday night after a guest allegedly tried to cut the line and was stopped by a worker, according to a witness who recorded the incident.\n\nVideo obtained by KTLA shows two guests and a security guard involved in an altercation near an outdoor entrance area at the park as a crowd watches and cheers from behind metal barricades. Several bystanders can be seen recording the scene on their phones.\n\nOne witness said the incident happened Saturday, Jan. 17, when a guest attempted to cut the line and was denied by a worker. Officials have not confirmed this information as of Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe witness said the situation escalated, and the same guest later swung at a security guard, causing the guard to suffer a nosebleed.\n\nFootage from the scene appeared to capture moments after the confrontation began. Two guests are seen — one seems to be attempting to mediate between another guest and the security guard with the nosebleed. The other guest manages to get around and hit the security guard, but is then immediately taken to the ground by the guard while the nearby line of people start to cheer.\n\nWhile the guard restrains the woman on the pavement and directs her to put her hands behind her back, another guard is seen standing nearby, monitoring the altercation and maintaining control of the area.\n\n“Knott’s staff did an excellent job in deescalting the situation, and made it less traumatic then it was even if her nose was bleeding and she was getting assaulted by the lady she did not use pepper spray or violence, she quickly got her on the floor,” said the witness.\n\nThe clip ends with the individual still on the ground as security remains on scene. The witness said that after the video concluded, law enforcement arrived on scene and handcuffed both guests who were seen in the video.\n\nIn a statement provided to KTLA, Knott’s Berry Farm said it is “committed to providing a safe and orderly environment for all guests and does not tolerate inappropriate behavior.” The park said all visitors are required to follow its Code of Conduct to maintain a family-friendly environment, and confirmed that Buena Park Police Department arrested two guests Saturday night for violating that policy.\n\nThe guests were removed from an attraction for allegedly jumping the line before the situation escalated into a physical confrontation involving a park employee and a security officer. Both guests were arrested and removed from the park, officials said.",

    "fullText": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says President Donald Trump is serious about annexing Greenland.\n\nTrump amped up the rhetoric on Saturday, announcing on Truth Social that the United States would impose new tariffs on Denmark, which controls Greenland, and other European countries unless they hand Greenland over.\n\nSpeaking to Kristen Welker on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Bessent said Trump's push to take over Greenland was not an empty land grab but a strategy to prevent future conflict.\n\n\"The national emergency is avoiding a national emergency,\" Bessent said. \"It is a strategic decision by the president. This is a geopolitical decision, and he's able to use the economic might of the US to avoid a hot war, so why wouldn't we do that?\"\n\nGreenland is strategically located in the Arctic, acting as a buffer between North America and Russia. It is also home to minerals important to the manufacturing of future technologies.\n\nTrump has recently said that at least part of his reasoning for wanting to annex Greenland is so it can house his Golden Dome missile defense project.\n\n\"The president is trying to avoid a conflict,\" Bessent said.\n\nThat project remains in early planning stages, however, and Denmark has never said it wouldn't allow Golden Dome infrastructure on its territory. The United States already has a military base in Greenland.\n\nThe spectre that the United States — recently emboldened by its surprise raid on Venezuela that netted its leader, Nicolás Maduro, allowing it to move to open the country's oil industry — could force Europe's hand by targeting its economy or even take Greenland by force, has rankled US allies across the Atlantic.\n\nEuropean Union leaders held an emergency meeting on Sunday, during which they called Trump's tariff threat economic blackmail.\n\n\"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,\" the eight EU nations targeted by Trump said in a joint statement released on Sunday.",

I drafted a resignation email.\n\nWhen my boss called me in, she surprised me: \"Take some time off,\" she said. \"Come back to manage a new launch later this year.\"\n\nMy plan for a year off collapsed into two months.\n\nIt began quietly in India at a yoga retreat near Kerala and ended with an adventure in Indonesia, climbing Mount Bromo and motorbiking through Yogyakarta.\n\nIt wasn't a true gap year, but it was long enough to reset. The next year, I stepped into my boss's role, leading the creative team I'd almost left behind.\n\nThat experience made me realize that time off doesn't have to derail a career — it can redefine it.\n\nI wasn't a student with few obligations or a 20-something who hadn't settled on a career path.

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican lawmakers are scrambling to contain President Donald Trump's threats of taking possession of Greenland, with some showing the most strident opposition to almost anything the Trump administration has done since taking office.\n\nThey gave floor speeches on the importance of NATO last week. They introduced bills meant to prevent the U.S. from attacking Denmark. And several traveled to Copenhagen to meet with Danish counterparts.\n\nBut it's not clear that will be enough, as the president continues to insist that he will take control of the Arctic island. It's raised fears of an end to NATO — a decades-old alliance that has been a pillar of American strength in Europe and around the globe — and raised questions on Capitol Hill and around the world about what Trump's aggressive, go-it-alone foreign policy will mean for world order.\n\n“When the most powerful military nation on earth threatens your territory through its president over and over and over again, you start to take it seriously,” Sen. Chris Coons told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Delaware Democrat organized the bipartisan trip to Denmark to “bring the temperature down a bit,” he said, as well as further talks about mutual military agreements in the Arctic. Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska accompanied a handful of Democrats on the trip. Also, Republican lawmakers joined in meetings in Washington last week with the Danish foreign minister and his Greenlandic counterpart where they discussed security agreements.\n\nYet it's clear Trump has other ideas. He said Saturday he will charge a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight European nations because of their opposition to his Greenland plans.\n\nTrump said on social media that because of modern weapons systems “the need to ACQUIRE is especially important.”\n\nThe pushback to Trump's Greenland plans\n\nKey Republicans have made clear they think that forcefully taking Greenland is out of the question. But so far, they've avoided directly rebuking Trump for his talk of possessing the island.\n\nTillis on social media called Trumps tariff plans “bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America’s allies.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters Thursday that “there’s certainly not an appetite here for some of the options that have been talked about or considered.”\n\nIn a floor speech, Thune's predecessor as Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell, warned that an attempt to seize Greenland would “shatter the trust of allies\" and tarnish Trump's legacy with a disastrous foreign policy decision.\n\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers alike see an obvious path to bolstering American interests in Greenland while keeping the relationship with NATO-ally Denmark intact.\n\nIn a meeting with lawmakers Thursday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt discussed how the countries could work together to develop critical mineral industries and military cooperation, Coons said. The diplomats also told the senators there is no evidence of Chinese or Russian activity in Greenland.\n\nTrump has made the argument that the U.S. should take Greenland before China or Russia do, prompting worry across Europe. Troops from several nations have been sent to Greenland in support of Denmark.\n\nMurkowski said on social media that “our NATO allies are being forced to divert attention and resources to Greenland, a dynamic that plays directly into Putin’s hands by threatening the stability of the strongest coalition of democracies the world has ever seen.”\n\nLawmakers are looking at a few options for taking a military attack on Greenland off the table. Still, the Trump administration has shown little if any willingness to get congressional approval before taking military action.\n\nLawmakers, including Republicans like Murkowski, are pushing legislation that would prohibit Department of Defense funds from being used to attack or occupy territory that belongs to other NATO members without their consent.\n\nThe Alaska senator also suggested Congress could act to nullify Trump's tariffs. Murkowski and several other Republicans have already helped pass resolutions last year meant to undo tariffs around the globe, but those pieces of legislation did not gain traction in the House. They would have also required Trump's signature or support from two-thirds of both chambers to override his veto.\n\nDemocrats have also found some traction with war powers resolutions meant to force the president to get congressional approval before engaging in hostilities. Republicans last week narrowly defeated one such resolution that would prohibit Trump from attacking Venezuela again, and Democrats think there could potentially be more Republicans who would support one applying to Greenland.\n\n“What I’ve noticed is these war powers resolutions, they do put some pressure on Republicans,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who has forced votes on several similar resolutions. He said the tactic has also compelled the Trump administration to provide lawmakers with briefings and commitments to get congressional approval before deploying troops.\n\nStill, while dismissing the Venezuela war powers resolution on Wednesday, Republican leaders made the argument that the legislation should be ruled out of order because the Trump administration has said there are currently no U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela.\n\nThat argument may set a precedent for future war powers resolutions, giving Republicans a way to avoid voting against Trump's wishes.\n\n“If you don't have boots on the ground, it's a moot point,” said Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, about war powers resolutions in general. He also argued that the prospect of taking Greenland over the objections of Denmark is nothing \"more than a hypothetical.”\n\nOther Republicans have expressed support for Trump's insistence that the U.S. possess Greenland, though they have downplayed the idea that the U.S. would take it by force.\n\nThat's left the strongest objections on the Republican side of the aisle coming from a handful of lawmakers who are leaving Congress next year.\n\nRep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told The Omaha World Herald that an invasion of Greenland would lead to Trump's impeachment — something he would “lean” towards supporting.\n\nTillis, another retiring Republican, has directed his criticism at Trump advisors like White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller.\n\n“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisors’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” he said.",

    "description": "Syrian troops fighting U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces seized the Omar oil field, the country’s largest, and the Conoco gas field in the eastern Deir Zor province as allied Arab",
    "fullText": "Jan 18 (Reuters) - Syrian troops fighting U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces seized the Omar oil field, the country’s largest, and the Conoco gas field in the eastern Deir Zor province as allied Arab tribal forces advanced ​in the oil-rich area along the border with Iraq, officials and security sources said on Sunday.\n\nThe takeover ‌of the oil fields that lie east of the Euphrates River — a main source of revenue for the Kurdish-led forces — was a major blow to ‌the group.\n\nSyrian government officials said the oil wealth the militia had controlled to sustain its self-administered region had deprived the state of much‑needed resources.\n\nSyrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa said last week it was unacceptable for a militia to control a quarter of the country and hold its main oil and commodities resources.\n\nThe Syrian army pressed ahead into predominantly Arab-populated areas of northeast Syria controlled ⁠by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), despite ‌U.S. calls to halt its advance.\n\nA government source said Kurdish-led forces were overcome after advances led by the Arab tribal fighters, allowing the government and its tribal allies to move into ‍a stretch of territory of more than 150 km along the eastern bank of the Euphrates stretching from Baghouz near the Iraqi border towards key towns, including al-Shuhail and Busayra.\n\nSyrian government officials said the advances effectively brought most of Deir al-Zor province — the country’s main ​oil- and wheat-producing area along the Euphrates — under their control.\n\nLate on Saturday, the army also took control of the ‌northern city of Tabqa and its adjacent dam, as well as the major Freedom Dam, formerly known as the Baath Dam, west of Raqqa.\n\nSyrian Kurdish authorities have not acknowledged the loss of those strategic sites and said fighting continued near the dam area, accusing Damascus of breaching an agreement on the withdrawal of forces from areas east of Aleppo to expand its offensive.\n\nSyrian Kurdish officials said factions aligned with the government were attacking their forces despite efforts to reach a peaceful ⁠outcome. The civil administration that runs the region said Damascus was intent ​on sowing divisions between Arabs and Kurds.\n\n“We are at a critical ​juncture. We either resist or live in dignity and face all types of injustice,” their statement said, urging residents of the majority-Arab areas to stand by the SDF.\n\n“We call on our people, especially ‍the youth, to take up arms ⁠and prepare to resist any attack. We are facing a war for our survival,” it added.\n\nThe government had called on SDF fighters — most of whom are from Arab tribes — to defect. It says hundreds have already ⁠switched sides and joined tribal forces fighting the SDF.\n\nDozens of Arab tribal leaders have said they had been marginalised under Kurdish leadership, a claim ‌the SDF denies, saying its ranks reflect the diversity of Syrian society.",

In which case, why not just pretend to give it to him? Fly him to somewhere that looks green, throw a military parade, and tell him that’s it. Senile fantasy fulfilled.",
    "fullText": "Of all the explanations for Donald Trump’s attempt to seize Greenland, the most superficially attractive is that the President has dementia. In which case, why not just pretend to give it to him? Fly him to somewhere that looks green, throw a military parade, and tell him that’s it. Senile fantasy fulfilled.\n\nAlas, the rot goes so much deeper. Trump is not mad, he’s doing what America always does, just crassly and out in the open. This became clearer this week when I chanced upon a copy of Lament for a Nation by the Canadian philosopher George Grant, published in 1965.\n\nGrant wrote at a turning point in his country’s history. In 1957, Canada had elected a conservative PM called John Diefenbaker who was not unlike Nigel Farage or, indeed, Trump: populist, nationalist, deeply anti-Left. But when the Americans asked to put their nuclear weapons on his soil, Diefenbaker – to my surprise – said no.\n\nHe believed he had a right to do this because Nato is, on paper, an alliance of equals – and a necessity because once Canada became a missile base, all pretence of an independent foreign policy would end.\n\nThe business and cultural elite turned on Diefenbaker and the public kicked him out of office.\n\nAmerica, basking in the glow of Jack Kennedy, was then admired as the embodiment of modernity: nationalism seemed antiquated and eccentric. Thus, argued Grant, Canada’s nuclear surrender represented the final stage in a process of economic and cultural assimilation. A society so integrated into the American Way lacked not just the resources but, crucially, the imagination to stand on its own two feet.\n\nSo it goes with contemporary Europe, where American corporations dominate and profit, yet also avoid paying a lot of tax. Ireland, for example, has rightly denounced Trump’s tariff war on the nations that oppose his aggressive takeover of Greenland – yet the country is a model of globalist acquiescence at the cost of sovereignty. It has embraced free markets (low corporate taxes) and free movement (mass migration), with the result that Dublin is outwardly Irish – still beautiful – yet unaffordable and embroiled in a violent identity crisis.\n\nThese are economic policies that its elites justify as essential to modern nation building (“we need money, we need workers”), and it’s striking that the SNP has proposed doing similar things should Scotland gain independence. As Grant observed in 1965, the modern nation state can only develop by opening its arms to global capitalism, but global capitalism “entails the disappearance of those indigenous differences that give substance to nationalism.”\n\nIn short, American capital has made all of us rich, but it has also made us duplicates of the US. I’m convinced that many Britons are desperately unhappy, even mentally ill, because they don’t feel like themselves anymore.\n\nIt’s obvious in the way we now talk (badly) and emote (too often) but most apparent in our politics, which is imported and detached from our real history. Identity politics was Made in America: when federal agents shot and killed a protestor in Minnesota (murder in my book), Labour mayors felt obliged to write a letter of support for the Democrat mayor of Minneapolis. Why?\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, James Cleverly says his hero is Ronald Reagan, the Tories sell the good life in terms of Reaganite aspiration, and the infamous Jenrick memo, written to plot his defection to Reform, described him as the “new sheriff in town”. Its author spelt favourite without a “u”.\n\nThe party Rob joins has painted itself into a corner, having gambled its credentials on access to Trump and now forced to pretend there’s distance. Lo, even Brexit has been colonised. Outside of the European Union, said its Right-wing think-tankers, the only hope is a deal with America, a logic that even Keir Starmer has swallowed, pursuing regulatory alignment on the future of AI.\n\nOne suspects that for all Labour’s hatred of Elon Musk, it will never ban Twitter, because Trump will almost certainly apply sanctions.\n\nWe should not think of the President as un-American, as some embarrassed Americans call him, but the most American president ever, which is to say the ultimate liberal.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans, even if they disagree on practical policies, are both drawn from the philosophical tradition of liberalism, rooted in love of individual freedom, the unleashing of personal passion. Trump wants something, so he makes it happen. That’s what liberalism means, and it has infected us, too.\n\nIt’s why in the UK marriage and birth are out of style, pews are empty, and our top-rated TV show involves traitors killing faithfuls for cash (“she’s playing a blinder,” they say, as if human relations are a competitive sport).\n\nIf Britain is broken – and a country where the latest figures show 299,614 abortions a year, 40 for a cleft lip or palate, is definitely broken – it is because millions have chosen to maximise their freedom and wealth at the cost of social solidarity.\n\nThe Old Canada of John Diefenbaker, claimed Grant, was different because it combined the Tory paternalism of England with the ethics of French Catholicism, which said “virtue must be prior to freedom.” But these are gone, and Grant concluded that their demise was unavoidable because no nation can resist the power of America or the temptation of individualism.\n\nLiberalism ends, if not quite in world government, then in the whole world looking the same. What do the Japanese eat on Christmas Day? KFC.\n\nThis is why I watch the trade war for Greenland with distress and, I’m afraid, pessimism. Yes, Trump must be resisted. It is a question of dignity.\n\nBut until we Europeans wean ourselves off America, not just militarily or economically but psychologically, we really cannot function without it and will always surrender. It has dominated us for a long time; we’ve only noticed since the empire that pushed out investment suddenly started to suck it back in, a phenomenon that, again, is not unique to Trump. Joe Biden used subsidies and tax breaks to re-shore jobs in the US, away from the continent.\n\nThe irony is that alternative, more benign American political traditions do exist, but they’ve always been dismissed by Europeans as naive or dangerous because they wouldn’t bankroll our defence: libertarian among the Republicans, socialist among the Democrats. If only we’d had president Ron Paul or president Bernie Sanders. Greenland would go unmolested.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Chelsea have held talks to sign Rennes centre-back Jeremy Jacquet during the winter transfer window.\n\nThe Blues have spoken to both Rennes and the 20-year-old's agent over a January move but are currently being quoted more than £60m to secure a deal this month.\n\nThe France Under-21 international is known to be interested in the move although BBC Sport understands there is substantial rival interest.\n\nThe talks follow an internal decision at Stamford Bridge to bring forward plans to sign a centre-back by six months, instead of waiting until the summer.\n\nAlternative options will also be considered. There is reported interest in Como defender Jacabo Ramon – who is also attracting attention from Real Madrid – and Bournemouth's Marcos Senesi.\n\nSenesi, whose contract expires at the end of the season, is also a Juventus target, while the south-coast club have yet to receive any formal contact from Chelsea.\n\nChelsea had previously explored signing a centre-back for former manager Enzo Maresca last summer, but key target Dean Huijsen opted to join Real Madrid.\n\nOther options were assessed but Chelsea did not believe they could find a suitable alternative, contributing to one of Maresca's early frustrations that eventually played a part in his mid-season departure.\n\nThe desire to sign a ball-playing centre-back came after Levi Colwill sustained a serious knee injury in pre-season, although his recovery is progressing well and there is optimism he will feature later in the campaign. He remains central to Chelsea's long-term plans.\n\nThere is also growing expectation that both Trevoh Chalobah and Tosin Adarabioyo will reach a crossroads in the summer, when they will have two years remaining on their contracts and either sign new deals or face the possibility of being sold.",

He remains in police custody at this time.\n\n\"Enquiries are ongoing and we would ask members of the public not to speculate whilst the investigation continues.\"\n\nThe Football Association of Wales (FAW) confirmed to BBC Sport Wales it was looking into the incident.\n\nA statement read: \"Tier-three matches fall under the jurisdiction of the FAW. The FAW is aware of the incident and will be reviewing it.\"\n\nMatch data shows referee Richard Gwyn Edwards did not issue any red cards during the contest, which was won 3-2 by hosts Porthmadog.",

    "fullText": "Arsenal may have left Nottingham Forest on Saturday night regretting a missed opportunity. The reality is they will actually never have a better chance of ending a Premier League title drought stretching back to 'The Invincibles' of 2004.\n\nMikel Arteta's side have emerged from the weekend with an advantage stretched to seven points as the chasing pack aiming to put them under pressure stumbled badly.\n\nArsenal and Arteta will rightly urge caution, but the Gunners will never forgive themselves if they do not claim the crown that has proved so elusive, faced with the domination of Manchester City and the successes of Liverpool.\n\nWhen every circumstance is examined, this feels like the 'now or never' season for Arteta's Arsenal.\n\nIf they fail to win the title this season from such a position, the regrets will run deep. Everything is in place for a triumphant surge towards the finishing tape.\n\nBack-to-back goalless draws has left some questioning Arsenal's firepower but, with the tightest defence in the league and their rivals continually slipping up, it would take a brave person to back against them now.\n\nBigger leads have been lost at the top of the Premier League before - and later in the season - but none of the teams below them are showing signs of producing the consistency needed to challenge them.\n\nManchester City failed to turn up the pressure valve before Arsenal travelled to the City Ground by losing the derby at Manchester United - a fourth straight match without a win.\n\nAnd then, here at Villa Park, Aston Villa saw their hopes of leap-frogging Pep Guardiola's side into second place undone as excellent Everton secured a fully deserved win.\n\nAs for reigning champions Liverpool, they have mounted a miserable defence of their crown, Saturday's disappointing draw against Burnley at Anfield that provoked jeers from their fans leaving them fourth, a distant 14 points behind Arsenal.\n\nVilla had won their previous 11 games at home, but Everton threatened the decisive moments long before Thierno Barry cashed in on keeper Emi Martinez's decision to turn a routine stop into an item for his showreel with a classy finish.",
