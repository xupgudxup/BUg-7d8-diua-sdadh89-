    "fullText": "Way-Too-Early college football rankings for 2026: Indiana, Ohio State, Georgia out in front originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWay-Too-Early Top 25 lists do serve a purpose.\n\nWe get the same push-back every year. How could you possibly rank teams this early with NIL and the transfer portal increasing volatility from year to year in the 12-team College Football Playoff era?\n\nUseless? Nah. This is a useful exercise as a baseline for the 2026-27 college football season.\n\nIt's fun to take a swing at what next season might look like, too.\n\nWe had Penn State, Clemson and LSU in the top 10 on this list last season, and it didn't work out. So what? We also had five of the 10 P4 playoff teams, and two \n\nNo. 1 Indiana plays for the CFP championship on Monday against No. 10 Miami. We had the Hoosiers at No. 10 and Hurricanes at No. 20 in 2025, and it's hard to read both teams given the number of experienced players both teams will lose. It's as combustible as ever after the transfer portal quarterback shuffle, and Sporting News Way Too Early Top 25 reflects that.\n\nThere will be changes before August – and we anticipate this could get nuked by the end of September next season. Guess what? That is the fun part.\n\nMORE CFP CHAMPIONSHIP GAME NEWS:\n\nExpert prediction of Indiana-Miami final\n\nCurt Cignetti's past meets his future in semis\n\nRoster breakdown: Who has more blue-chippers?\n\nWhy Miami gets to keep all CFP revenue\n\nIs Indiana better than Joe Burrow-led LSU?\n\nMiami's run has a March Madness feel\n\nWhy would we doubt Curt Cignetti? The Hoosiers will have heavy losses to the 2026 NFL Draft – including potential No. 1 pick Fernando Mendoza – but Indiana will combine returners such as receiver Charlie Becker and defensive tackle Rolijah Hardy with another strong portal class. TCU quarterback Josh Hoover (3,472 yards, 29 TDs, 13 INTs), Boston College running back Turbo Richard (749 yards, 9 TDs), Michigan State receiver Nick Marsh (662 yards, 6 TDs) and Kansas State edge rusher Tobi Osunsanmi (4 sacks) lead the changes. Indiana had a top-25 recruiting class, too. Ohio State and USC visit Memorial Stadium this year.\n\nMORE: Curt Cignetti's past met its future during College Football Playoff\n\nOhio State coach Ryan Day still has yet to name a new offensive coordinator after Brian Hartline left for South Florida. Defensive coordinator Matt Patricia is back to run what will be a re-tooled defense led by defensive lineman Kenyatta Jackson Jr.  Heisman Trophy finalist Julian Sayin (3,610 yards, 32 TDs, 8 INTs), running back Bo Jackson (1,090 yards, 6 TDs) and receiver Jeremiah Smith (1,243 yards, 12 TDs) return on offense. Five-star freshman Chris Henry Jr. also should make an instant impact. The schedule is high level with road trips to Texas, Iowa, USC and Indiana and home games against Oregon and Michigan.\n\nThe Bulldogs won back-to-back SEC championships under coach Kirby Smart – and quarterback Gunner Stockton returns after a solid first season as a starter. Tackle Monroe Freeling and linebacker CJ Allen declared for the NFL Draft, but running back Nate Frazier (947 yards, 6 TDs) and tackle Earnest Greene are back. Linebacker Raylen Wilson and safety KJ Bolden will be anchors for a solid defense. Road trips to Alabama (Oct. 10) and Ole Miss (Nov. 7) are the marquee games on the schedule.\n\nMORE: Transfer portal winners and losers\n\nArch Manning returns at quarterback, and so does the preseason hype. He will have a loaded group of receivers with Ryan Wingo, Emmett Mosley V and Auburn transfer Cam Coleman – who had 13 TD receptions the last two seasons. Arizona State transfer running back Raleek Brown (1,141 yards, 4) and NC State transfer back  offset Hollywood Smothers (939 yards, 6 TDs) the loss of leading rusher Tre Wisner. Will the Longhorns' offensive line be better? They nabbed Wake Forest's starting left tackle Melvin Siani just before the portal closed. Pitt linebacker Rasheem Biles and Florida State linebacker Justin Cryer add to the defense – which welcomes the return of defensive coordinator Will Muschamp. The Longhorns have a return home game against Ohio State (Sept. 12), and the SEC schedule does not offer many breaks.\n\nHow will the Irish respond to this year's playoff snub under coach Marcus Freeman, who is 43-12 since taking over as head coach? Quarterback CJ Carr – who had 2,751 yards, 24 TDs and six interceptions – is a Heisman Trophy contender. Running back Aneyas Williams and receivers Jaden Greathouse and Jordan Faison should work behind an experienced offensive line. Ohio State transfer wide receiver Quincy Porter is a nice addition. All-American cornerback Leonard Moore is back along with senior linebacker Drayk Bowen. Notre Dame opens with Wisconsin (Sept. 6) at Lambeau Field, and the home matchup with Miami (Nov. 7) will be huge.\n\nMORE: Marcus Freeman choosing ND shows college sports aren't doomed\n\nDante Moore (3,565 yards, 30 TDs, 10 INTs) returns at starting quarterback for the Ducks, and Nebraska transfer Dylan Raiola also is in the QB room. That's a fantastic start for coach Dan Lanning, who replaces coordinators Will Stein and Tosh Lupoi with Drew Mehringer and Chris Hampton. The defense added Minnesota safety Koi Perich – one of the most-exciting players in college football. The Ducks have settled in the Big Ten as an every-year contender, and the schedule features matchups against Ohio State, Michigan and USC.\n\nTexas Tech isn't done yet after making its first CFP appearance under Joey McGuire. The Red Raiders landed Cincinnati quarterback Brendan Sorsby – who had 2,800 passing yards, 28 TDs and seven interceptions. Auburn transfer Malcolm Simmons averaged 18.3 yards per catch. The defense loses impact players such as Jacob Rodriguez, David Bailey and Lee Hunter – so there is work to do to replicate that dominance from 2025. San Diego State edge rusher Trey White – who had 19.5 sacks the last two seasons – and Kansas State transfer Austin Romaine – who has 184 career tackles – should help.\n\nMORE: Brendan Sorsby tops SN's transfer portal QB rankings\n\nThe Hurricanes enjoyed the long-awaited break-through to a CFP championship game under Mario Cristobal, but there will likely be heavy losses from a veteran roster starting at quarterback with Carson Beck. Miami stole Darian Mensah away from Duke just before the CFP championship game. Receiver Malachi Toney and defensive tackle Justin Scott are back – but there will be some interesting roster decisions after the CFP championship game.\n\nCan Brent Venables get Oklahoma back to the College Football Playoff? Quarterback John Mateer, receiver Isaiah Sategna and leading tackler Kip Lewis are returning, but 26 players have entered the portal. Texas receiver Parker Livingstone is a solid pickup, and Michigan linebacker Cole Sullivan adds to a defense that also returns defensive tackle David Stone, Peyton Bowen and Eli Bowen. Oklahoma plays at Michigan (Sept. 12) and Georgia (Sept. 26) in the first month.\n\nHow will Pete Golding navigate his first full season as head coach? Dynamic quarterback Trinidad Chambliss is suing the NCAA to be eligible for another season. If Chambliss is denied, then Auburn transfer quarterback Deuce Knight would likely be the starter. Running back Kewan Lacy (1,567 yards, 24 TDs) is back, and the Rebels did not have a massive exodus in the portal. LSU visits Vaught-Hemingway Stadium on Sept. 19 in Lane Kiffin's return.\n\nThe Cougars are 23-4 the last two seasons. Quarterback Bear Bachmeier and Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year LJ Martin are back from a team that was on the cusp of the College Football Playoff, but the Cougars will have to replace receiver Chase Roberts and BYU added four tackles – including USC's Walker Lyons – via the transfer portal. Linebacker Isaiah Glasker and safety Faleatu Satuala are the key returners on defense. Utah and Notre Dame are the marquee games on the schedule.\n\nThis will be a telling third year for Kalen DeBoer. Ty Simpson declared for the NFL Draft, meaning the quarterback competition between Austin Mack and Keelon Russell is front and center. The Crimson Tide have 20 players who left via the transfer portal, and running back Daniel Hill and receiver Ryan Williams are key returners – but the offense line will need to be rebuilt again. Safety Brady Hubbard is back on defense. Early-season home games against Florida State (Sept. 19) and Georgia (Oct. 10) will be a good gauge for where the Crimson Tide stand.\n\nThird-year coach Mike Elko can build off a CFP appearance. Quarterback Marcel Reed ranked fifth in the SEC with 3,169 passing yards. Reuben Owens III returns and will take on a lead role at running back, and Alabama transfer receiver Isaiah Horton is a key addition. The defense will have to replace the production from All-American Cashius Howell – and the schedule is tougher this time with road trips to LSU (Sept. 26), Alabama (Oct. 24) and Oklahoma (Nov. 24) before the home finale against Texas (Nov. 27).\n\nThe Trojans are 16-10 since joining the Big Ten, and this is another prove-it year for Lincoln Riley. Quarterback Jayden Maiava returns. He ranked fourth in the FBS with 3,711 passing yards. The Trojans also brought in the top recruiting class in the country. Defensive coordinator D'Anton Lynn left for Penn State, however, and the Trojans lost 20 players in the transfer portal. Trips to Indiana and Penn State and home games against Ohio State and Oregon are the highlights.\n\nMorgan Scalley takes over for longtime coach Kyle Whittingham, and the Utes should be right back in the mix in the Big 12 race. Quarterbacks Devin Damper and Byrd Ficklin both return, and leading rusher Wayshawn Parker (981 yards, 6 TDs) is back. Safety Tao Johnson is a top returner on defense. Utah closed the season with six straight victories and averaged 46.5 points per game. Will that momentum carrry over with Scalley?\n\nWhittingham takes over at Michigan after Sherrone Moore was fired. New offensive coordinator Jason Beck will get to work with quarterback Bryce Underwood, who had 2,418 yards, 11 TDs and nine interceptions as a freshman. Jordan Marshall and five-star freshman Savion Hiter from a strong backfield, and Texas transfer Jamie Ffrench adds to the receiver room. Utah edge rusher John Henry Daley – who had 11.5 sacks – is a portal prize. The Wolverines play Oklahoma on Sept. 12 and face Indiana, Oregon and Ohio State in Big Ten play.\n\nHow will Lane Kiffin fare in Year 1 at LSU? The “Portal King” reeled in Arizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt and nine receivers via the transfer portal. Running back Caden Durham also is back. Linebacker Whit Weeks returns to what should be a healthier defense, and Boise State safety Ty Benefield will be a star in this defense.  September features the home opener at Clemson (Sept. 5), Kiffin's return to Ole Miss (Sept. 19) and a home game against Texas A&M (Sept. 26).\n\nPenn State hired Matt Campbell, and 22 players from Iowa State followed him to Happy Valley, including veteran quarterback Rocco Becht (2,584 yards, 16 TDs, 9 INTs). It's an overhaul at almost every position, and the running back room features Iowa State's Carson Hansen and Ohio State transfer James Peoples. We trust Campbell, but this feels like a transition season despite a friendly schedule that does not include Indiana, Ohio State or Oregon.\n\nThis could be Jeff Brohm's best team if Ohio State transfer Lincoln Kienholz takes command of the starting quarterback job. Running backs Isaac Brown (884 yards, 7 TDs) and Keyjuan Brown (704 yards, 6 TDs) are back, and edge rusher Clev Lubin (8.5 sacks, 13.5 TFLs) also returns. Brohm has 27 players coming in via the portal, including Vanderbilt receiver Tre Richardson (806 yards, 7 TDs). The Cardinals have a showcase opener against Ole Miss (Sept. 5) at Nissan Stadium in Nashville, Tenn.\n\nIowa is in its customary spot under long-time coach Kirk Ferentz in these rankings. Wake Forest transfer Jeremy Hecklinski and Hank Brown will battle for the starting QB job. Kamari Moulton returns at running back, and Kade Pieper will anchor the offensive line. Zach Lutmer (71 tackles, 3 INTs) leads the defense. Iowa State, Ohio State, Nebraska and Wisconsin all visit Kinnick Stadium. The Hawkeyes have finished between No. 16 and No. 25 six of the last eight seasons.\n\nThe Cougars are a legit Big 12 sleeper contender under coach Willie Fritz. Quarterback Conner Weigman, Oregon transfer running back Makhi Hughes and receiver Amare Thomas – who had 966 yards and 12 TDs – lead the offense. Five-star quarterback Keisean Henderson could get opportunities too. Tulane guard Shadre Hurst – a second-team SN All-America pick – beefs up the offensive line. The defense has to replace its top two tacklers. A road trip to Texas Tech could be the best game on the Big 12 schedule.\n\nThe Illini are 19-7 the last two seasons under Bret Bielema. Luke Altmyer is gone, and East Carolina transfer Katin Houser is a solid replacement. A supporting cast of running back Caa'Lil Valentine (614 yards, 4 TDs) and receivers Collin Dixon (548 yards, 5 TDs) and Hudson Clement (454 yards, 3 TDs) is back. The defense will have to replace the production left by edge rusher Gabe Jacas. Illinois faces Duke (Sept. 12) early, and the Big Ten schedule features matchups against Oregon and at Ohio State.\n\nSMU is 20-7 with a CFP appearance under Rhett Lashlee since joining the ACC. Quarterback Kevin Jennings returns for his senior season. The Mustangs picked up East Carolina receiver Yanick Smith (583 yards, 5 TDs) via the portal. SMU plays at Notre Dame, and the conference schedule is favorable outside of a trip to Louisville. The Mustangs will be right back in the ACC championship hunt.\n\nDemond Williams (3,065 passing yards, 25 TDs, 8 INTs) is returning at quarterback for Washington after a brief interlude with LSU. He also had 611 rushing yards and six TDs. Oregon running back Jayden Limar is a portal find who replaces Adam Mohamed, who transferred to Cal. Coach Jedd Fisch reeled in a top-10 recruiting class, too. Washington has home games with Indiana and Penn State and road tests at Oregon and USC.\n\nWill Eddie Robinson Coach of the year Clark Lea capitalize on the momentum created by Diego Pavia and All-American tight end Eli Stowers in 2025? Five-star freshman quarterback Jared Curtis is up next, and the Commodores added 16 players via the transfer portal. Clemson safety Ricardo Jones joins CJ Heard in the secondary, and linebacker Bryan Longwell – who has 70 tackles – also returns. The Commodores won't surprise anybody this year – and the matchups with Georgia (Oct. 3) and Alabama (Nov. 14) will tell the tale.\n\nManny Diaz led the Blue Devils to an ACC championship this season, but losing Mensah is a huge blow, especially with backup Henry Belin IV also gone. Running back Nate Sheppard – who had 1,132 yards and 11 TDs – also returns. Duke added 14 players via the transfer portal. The Blue Devils should be one of the best offenses in the ACC, and an early-season game at Illinois (Sept. 12) is a good barometer for success.\n\nDo you believe James Franklin can guide a quick turn-around at Virginia Tech? He flipped several Nittany Lions' recruits and brought 12 Penn State players from the transfer portal, and that includes quarterback Ethan Grunkemeyer. This might be a year early, especially with a schedule that includes road trips to Clemson, SMU and Miami.",

    "fullText": "Paddy Pimblett is preparing for the biggest fight of his career as he gets ready to face Justin Gaethje in the UFC 324 main event.\n\nThe fight takes place on January 24 at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, with the interim lightweight title on the line. Both fighters are entering the bout with confidence, knowing that victory could lead to a unification fight for the undisputed championship later this year.\n\nIt marks Pimblett’s first pay-per-view headliner and his toughest challenge yet. Gaethje, a former interim champion, brings experience and knockout power, while Pimblett’s creativity and endurance have made him one of the sport’s rising stars.\n\nTom Aspinall offered insight into Pimblett’s preparations ahead of the fight, saying: “It’s top secret stuff, so you guys can’t see it. But very interesting. It’s always interesting with Paddy because he does a lot of unorthodox things.”\n\n“It’s nice to watch a bit of Paddy in the gym doing stuff that I’ve not seen him do before in the Octagon. I know that he’s got it and that he can do it well. So we’ll see if he puts any of this into his fight with Gaethje,” he added.\n\nAspinall’s comments have fuelled curiosity among fans about what Pimblett might showcase on fight night.\n\nKnown for his energy and unpredictability, Pimblett has reportedly been adding new technical layers to his striking while sharpening his grappling base to handle Gaethje’s pressure style.\n\nContinuing his thoughts, Aspinall said: “There’s been a couple of times where I’ve thought Paddy’s had big tests in front of him and he’s passed them, and he showed me in his last fight he can really stick to a game plan, and he’s going to need that with Gaethje. So, I’m going to go Paddy.”\n\nThe heavyweight champion’s backing reflects the belief within Team Pimblett that discipline will be key to victory. Gaethje’s aggression and leg kicks have caused problems for elite opponents, but Pimblett’s growing composure and fight IQ could help him turn the tide if he avoids early exchanges.\n\nAnalysts expect Pimblett to use his footwork and counter timing to frustrate Gaethje before finding openings late in the fight. For Pimblett, a win in Las Vegas would not only secure the interim belt but also redefine his standing in the lightweight division.\n\nFor Gaethje, it is a chance to prove that experience still trumps momentum in one of the most competitive divisions in the sport.\n\nWith both fighters motivated and styles that promise chaos, UFC 324 could deliver one of the most memorable main events of the year.",

    "description": "Patrick Reed played on three professionalc circuits in 2025, but none of the were the PGA Tour,. He says he'd consider returning if he was given the opportunity",
    "fullText": "DUBAI — Patrick Reed is a true golfer of the world.\n\nIt’s why he’s in the Middle East to kick off his 2026 season with three DP World Tour events before the LIV Golf season starts next month. That globetrotting commitment to both the DP World and Asian tours is why he’s still ranked No. 41 in the world, despite LIV not receiving Official World Golf Ranking points.\n\nEarlier this month, the 2018 Masters champion was enjoying a well-earned rest following his 32-event 2025 season when news broke that fellow LIV golfer Brooks Koepka was going back to the PGA Tour via the newly established Returning Member Program. The plan was created for LIV players who have not been a PGA Tour member for two years and who have won the Masters, U.S. Open, PGA Championship, Open Championship or Players Championship from 2022-2025. Only Koepka, Cameron Smith, Bryson DeChambeau and Jon Rahm were eligible, and the latter three said last week they would continue to play on LIV.\n\nReed, who has played on LIV since its 2022 inaugural season and has one individual victory in 45 total starts, didn’t have the ability to consider the opportunity, but at the Dubai Invitational on Saturday, he was asked, hypothetically, if he would think about returning. “I mean, of course; if it were up to me, I'd play everywhere,” Reed said.\n\nHe does play everywhere. In 2025, the Texan teed up in 14 LIV events, four majors, 10 DP World Tour tournaments and four Asian Tour stops. “I'm already playing on three tours, why not add one more?” he added with a laugh. “I always enjoyed my time out there on the PGA Tour. Let's be honest, out there, it's the best tour in the world. Look at what they've done in golf … I could see myself playing there at some point again. But right now, you just never know; everything's so fluid.”\n\nSince donning the green jacket in 2018, Reed, 35, has been a regular feature in majors. He was fourth at the U.S. Open at Shinnecock immediately after his Masters victory and 10th at the 2019 Open Championship. He logged top-10s at Augusta National in 2020 and 2021 before becoming a serious Masters contender again. Reed finished T-4 in 2023 and T-3 last year, where he was genuinely in the hunt on the back nine on Sunday.\n\nDespite that form in golf’s four biggest events recently, Reed is not eligible for the Returning Member Program, given it rewards major victories after LIV debuted in 2022.\n\n“Right now, it's not even a decision,” Reed said. “That was for ’22 and on winners. So, I definitely would have to think about it … if that number [came] down to 2018. Right now, it's hard to say really what we're going to do or anything like that. Right now, the biggest thing is trying to play some good golf these [two] weeks, not only to solidify myself out here on DP, but to have a good momentum going into the year.”\n\nReed, a nine-time PGA Tour winner, was given honorary life membership on the DP World Tour in 2019 due to his staunch support of the European circuit. His commitment will run even deeper this year when he is likely to be paying fines for each LIV event he plays that conflicts with a DP World Tour tournament. The amount of each fine is not known.\n\nAs reported by The Telegraph, LIV Golf has paid fines in the past on behalf of its players but will no longer do so in 2026. That won’t stop Reed though, although he says he’d “love for it to be resolved.”\n\n“I always plan on showing my support on this tour and it's not going to stop me,” Reed said. “Starting this year, any fines or anything like that will go on the players, not on LIV. Right now, playing [these three] DP World Tour events [before the LIV season starts Feb. 4], I'm not getting fined.\n\n“Me travelling and playing around the world … it helps this tour, but also it's something I've always held true to my heart and wanted to do. So, if that's what it takes [paying the fines], that's what it takes.\n\n“I've always wanted to be a worldwide player,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Steelers predicted to hire Super Bowl-winning assistant as next head coach originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers are set to hire their fourth head coach since 1970 in 2026, as the franchise has been moving quickly to schedule interviews with candidates and find their replacement for Mike Tomlin, who stepped down last week.\n\nPittsburgh has been selective with whom they'll interview, but one strong candidate for the Steelers' head coaching job is Los Angeles Rams head coach Chris Shula.\n\nShula is still in the playoffs, as the Rams picked up an overtime win over the Chicago Bears in the divisional round on Sunday. However, he interviewed virtually with Pittsburgh last Friday, and Bleacher Report's Erik Beaston predicts Shula will be the Steelers' next head coach.\n\nHere is what Beaston had to say about Pittsburgh's coaching search, and why Shula would be a logical hire:\n\n\"As for the Steelers, a head coaching candidate with an offensive mindset would represent a fresh start, although the team has been defined by its defense throughout its long and illustrious history.\"\n\nShula has established himself as an elite head coaching candidate this year, leading the Rams' defense to a top-ten scoring finish. Los Angeles has had to play high-powered offenses all season, but the moment hasn't been too big for Shula.\n\nMoving in a new direction and hiring an offensive coach would be a refreshing move from the Steelers. However, if the team sticks with their franchise identity and brings in another defensive coach, Shula is the obvious hire.\n\nThe 39-year-old is a promising defensive mind and would be able to take a capable offensive coordinator from the Sean McVay tree with him to the Steelers.\n\nRams passing coordinator Nate Scheelhaase, who is receiving interest as an offensive coordinator and even a head coach, would be a logical OC fit in Pittsburgh with Shula.\n\nThe grandson of Hall of Fame Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula, Chris, could be the next great defensive-minded head coach. Though the head coaching market is deep, the Steelers shouldn't pass on the opportunity to hire Shula.\n\nJosh Allen sheds tears during postgame presser after loss to Broncos\n\nBills veteran announces desire to only play for Buffalo or retire\n\nBrowns rumor could complicate Giants' offensive coordinator search\n\nSeahawks playoff win is bad news for Raiders, Ravens, Dolphins\n\nKenneth Walker contract looms large after dominant game vs. 49ers",

In her first season of GB3, she secured her first podium finish in the series, and she will look to build on that momentum in her second year.\n\nPulling already has a strong relationship with Rodin Motorsport, having competed with the team in the 2024 season of British Formula 4, F1 Academy, GB3 and having become a Rodin Cars brand ambassador.\n\n\"You thought I was finished? Well, this chapter isn't done,\" the former F1 Academy driver said in a social media video. \"I have a lot more to prove and some unfinished business.

    "fullText": "Miami will be playing for a national championship on its home field Monday night as it squares off against the Indiana Hoosiers in Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nThe Hurricanes are one of the most dominant college football programs of the last 50 years, and they are looking to add their sixth national title in this game. However, to an entire generation of college football fans, Miami's appearance in a CFP title game is anything but typical.\n\nThe national title drought for the Hurricanes has lasted 24 years, as they last claimed a trophy during the 2001 season. Miami hasn't even played for a national title since the 2002 season — in which it lost to Ohio State in overtime on a now-infamous pass interference penalty.\n\nThe decades since have not been kind to the Hurricanes. They won 11 games the following year in 2003, but that was the last double-digit win total until a 10-win season under Mark Richt in 2017. After that, the 'Canes didn't reach double-digit wins again until 2024 under Mario Cristobal, who has now won 23 games over the last two campaigns.\n\nMiami football is inarguably \"back,\" and a win over the Hoosiers to claim its sixth national championship would only further solidify that fact.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: When was Miami football's last national championship appearance?",

    "fullText": "UEFA have confirmed their choice of match officials for Tuesday’s game between Arsenal and Inter Milan, with an almost fully Portuguese group in charge for the fixture.\n\nJoao Pinheiro will referee the match, assisted by Bruno Jesus and Luciano Maia. Joao Goncalves will be the fourth official.\n\nThen Tiago Martins will be on VAR, with Carlos del Cerro Grande as the assistant VAR. Del Cerro is the one non-Portuguese official on the match, as he hails from Spain.\n\nReferee Pinheiro has never taken charge of an Arsenal match before, though he has refereed a number of other English teams including Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City, Chelsea, Manchester United, and others.\n\nThe same is true of VAR official Tiago Martins, who has also never refereed the Gunners. So the match officials should be coming to this game almost completely fresh.\n\nThe “almost” is because Pinheiro has refereed hosts Inter Milan once before, taking a group stage match against RB Leipzig back in 2024. Inter won the match 1-0, though they felt aggrieved at a couple of the decisions given against them.\n\nIn terms of his general refereeing experience, Pinheiro reffed the UEFA Super Cup between PSG and Spurs earlier this season, as well as the Allianz Cup between Sporting CP and Benfica last January.\n\nThe ref will be very familiar with Viktor Gyokeres, who scored penalties for Sporting in normal time and in the shootout of that match.\n\nAfter Arsenal were denied a clear spot-kick away to Inter last season, only to see the opposition awarded a penalty for a soft handball call, the Gunners will just hope the officiating gives them a fair chance this time around.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Chicago Bears may have staged another miraculous resurrection in the NFC’s Divisional round of this postseason, but they ultimately suffered the knockout punch from the visiting Los Angeles Rams.\n\nOn a freezing Sunday in the city where defense was deified, the resilient yet erratic Rams – despite surrendering a seven-point lead in the final minute of regulation – emerged from their corner to defeat the Chicago Bears 20-17 in overtime. The haymaker came on kicker Harrison Mevis’s game-winning conversion in the extra period, a 42-yard drive-ender following a turnover with 3:19 to go.\n\nA clip posted on social media captures Williams' immediate reaction, displaying heavy disappointment, exhaustion, and internal processing following the final whistle. The footage shows QB dealing with the suddenness of the playoff exit:\n\nQB Caleb Williams is emotional after the Chicago Bears' playoff loss pic.twitter.com/ADkI6hDlmU\n\n— MOHAMMAD ASIF ANSARI (@WriterMohammad) January 19, 2026\n\n\"It was cool in the moment,\" Williams said during his post-game comments regarding the late equalizer. \"I can appreciate the organization. The city of Chicago. I can appreciate the sacrifice and growth we've had as a team. And I can appreciate the growth I've had and the trust I've had with Ben and my teammates. Those are the things I can appreciate.\"\n\nThe Bears were on the ropes at regulation’s conclusion, with quarterback Caleb Williams – the record-setting second-year starter – throwing a game-tying touchdown to tight end Cole Kmet on a scrambling play similar to the heroics he displayed throughout the regular season with just 18 seconds remaining. The 14-yard score required the ball to travel 51.2 yards through the air after Williams retreated 20 yards to escape defensive pressure, making it one of the most improbable completions of the postseason. However, the momentum shifted on the opening possession of overtime when Rams safety Kamren Curl intercepted a deep pass from Williams. This turnover set up a game-winning drive led by Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, effectively ending the Bears' 12-game winning streak.\n\nWilliams finished the evening with 257 yards through the air, completing 23 of 42 attempts for two touchdowns. Overall, the quarterback tossed three interceptions – a career-high mark against Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, who received credit for a game plan that stifled the Chicago offense for much of the evening. Analysts pointed to the Rams' defensive front, led by Jared Verse, as a deciding factor in disrupting the Chicago passing lanes. Despite the interceptions, head coach Ben Johnson maintained that Williams did not show nerves during the high-stakes game, describing the rookie as an \"eraser\" who compensates for coaching mistakes.\n\n“He's an eraser, you know,” Johnson said. “I have plenty of bad calls each and every week and he helps make it right for me. I know he's feeling it because we didn't win.”\n\nCaleb Williams has been the most resilient leader that the Chicago franchise has drafted in decades, setting a modern NFL record for a first-year starter by leading seven fourth-quarter comeback wins. These frequent late-game heroics led regional sports networks to refer to the squad as the \"Cardiac Bears\" throughout the 2025 campaign.\n\nThe loss concluded a historic season for the Chicago franchise, as Williams moved into fourth place on the Bears' all-time playoff passing list with 619 career yards and tied Jim McMahon and Rex Grossman for second in franchise history with four playoff passing touchdowns, according to FOX Sports.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams will face the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship next weekend, immediately following their survival at Soldier Field.\n\nThe Bears will begin their offseason exit process immediately, with Williams stating he intends to review game film to improve his footwork and accuracy. The quarterback plans to organize offseason sessions with his receivers to ensure they are prepared for training camp.\n\nMatthew Stafford credits Dennis Allen for disrupting Rams offense\n\n'The elements weren't a factor': Caleb Williams dismisses weather critique\n\nWhat did Caleb Williams see on that miraculous TD pass to Cole Kmet?\n\nA look at the postgame handshake between Sean McVay, Ben Johnson",

    "fullText": "Senegal faces potential sanctions from the Confederation of African Football (CAF) after their team controversially walked off the pitch during the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) final against hosts Morocco.\n\nThe dramatic protest, sparked by a late penalty decision, briefly halted play before Senegal ultimately secured victory in extra-time.\n\nThe incident unfolded in the eighth minute of stoppage time when Morocco was awarded a penalty following a VAR review, moments after Senegal had a goal disallowed.\n\nHead coach Pape Thiaw led his players off the field in protest, causing a 16-minute delay before play resumed.\n\nMorocco's Brahim Diaz subsequently missed the spot-kick, and Senegal went on to win the match thanks to a spectacular extra-time strike from Pape Gueye.\n\nDespite their triumph, Senegal's celebrations are likely to be overshadowed by disciplinary action.\n\nTournament organisers, the CAF, have condemned the behaviour. In a statement, the confederation said: \"CAF condemns the unacceptable behaviour of some players and officials during the TotalEnergies CAF Africa Cup of Nations Morocco 2025 final between Morocco and Senegal in Rabat last night.\n\n“CAF strongly condemns any inappropriate behaviour which occurs during matches, especially those targeting the refereeing team or match organisers. CAF is reviewing all footage and will refer the matter to competent bodies for appropriate action to be taken against those found guilty.\"\n\nFormer Liverpool forward Sadio Mane appeared reluctant to join the protest, later stating that his country would have been \"crazy\" not to finish the game.\n\nHe told reporters: \"It would have been a shame and sad to see this kind of scenario happen. Just imagine for a second going into the locker rooms and the football match stopping there. I think that would convey a negative image of our football. I think Africa today does not deserve that.\n\n“African football has evolved in an incredible way and the proof is that it is followed all over the world. So, on my side, I did what I had to do.\n\n“I think it would be crazy to not play this game because what, the referee gave a penalty and we go out of the game? I think that would be the worst thing, especially in African football. I’d rather lose than this kind of thing happen to our football.\"\n\nSenegal's head coach, Pape Thiaw, later apologised for his actions. Speaking to beIN Sports, he admitted: \"After reflecting on it, I made them come back (on the pitch) – you can react in the heat of the moment. We accept the errors of the referee. We shouldn’t have done it but it’s done and now we present our apologies to football.\"\n\nHowever, Morocco's head coach Walid Regragui criticised Thiaw for instigating the walk-off.\n\nHe stated: \"The image we’ve given of Africa is shameful. A coach who asks his players to leave the field. What Pape did does not honour Africa. Thiaw wasn’t classy. But he is a champion, so he can say whatever he wants. We stopped the match in the eyes of the world for 10 minutes.\"\n\nThe incident has cast a shadow over Senegal's victory, with the CAF's impending disciplinary action set to address the controversial protest that briefly marred the continent's premier football final.",

It was a controversial decision, but you have to respect his honesty.\n\nRaheem Sterling, Axel Disasi, and Ben Chilwell were among those moved aside in what became known as Chelsea’s “bomb squad”.\n\nChilwell eventually moved on to Strasbourg while both Disasi and Sterling are still searching for new clubs this month after nearly two years out of the picture.\n\nLiam Rosenior did say he planned to speak with Disasi and Sterling, but it is not clear if those conversations have taken place yet.\n\nAxel Disasi did himself no favours with his recent showing for Chelsea’s Under-21s, struggling in a heavy 6-2 defeat to Benfica.\n\nBut despite that performance, interest in him has not gone away.\n\nSpeaking on a live stream for X (formerly known as Twitter), Ben Jacobs noted that both Roma and Lyon have shown interest in the centre-back.\n\n“You have Axel Disasi, a centre-back at Chelsea, who is available, and Saudi clubs plus Roma and Lyon have made inquiries. Raheem Sterling as well, but I’m told he doesn’t want to move to Saudi Arabia or MLS.”\n\nChelsea currently have Wesley Fofana, Tosin Adarabioyo, Trevoh Chalobah and Levi Colwill as their primary options in the heart of defence.\n\nBut with Colwill unlikely to return before the season ends, the club has been forced to look elsewhere.\n\nWith that in mind, Jeremy Jacquet has emerged as a potential target for Chelsea.\n\nReports suggest that Jacquet has already agreed personal terms with the club.",

    "fullText": "Arne Slot’s time seems to be running out at Liverpool and speculation is mounting over who could replace the Dutchman.\n\nSeveral of the Reds’ biggest rivals have parted ways with their head coaches this season, including Manchester United and Chelsea.\n\nChelsea have already appointed a new permanent manager, Liam Rosenior, but Manchester United have taken a different approach, appointing former player Michael Carrick as an interim boss until the end of the season.\n\nIf Slot was relieved of his duties, and Liverpool did choose to follow in the footsteps of United, there are a number of contenders who could take interim charge of the club.\n\nSteven Gerrard has been widely discussed as the obvious candidate to take temporary control of Liverpool if Slot is sacked, but there is another obvious candidate that is already at the club.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nLiverpool’s under 21 manager, Rob Page, has put together an excellent run to start 2026, one that was compounded by the young Reds’ 7-0 win over Arsenal on Saturday.\n\nPage is the former manager of the Welsh national team and made over 400 senior appearances before turning to coaching.\n\nThe Welshman is familiar with the club and could be the man to right the ship at Anfield, with his extensive knowledge of Liverpool academy talents likely a big positive in the eyes of Michael Edwards and Richard Hughes.\n\nPage’s only previous experience coaching club sides is limited to stints with Port Vale and Northampton Town, but his U21 side are undefeated in 2026 and he would represent a cheaper option than Gerrard for the interim Liverpool job.\n\nSlot's job is under immense pressure, but Liverpool are still expected to give the Dutchman time to turn performances around and secure his future at Anfield.\n\nIf Slot cannot turn things around, and Liverpool do decide to appoint an interim manager until the end of the season, Rob Page has cemented himself as one of the obvious candidates for the job.",

    "fullText": "The false start after the winter break is complete! Before Christmas, Bayer Leverkusen was still in third place in the Bundesliga, but within three matchdays, they plummeted to sixth place.\n\nA 1:4 defeat against VfB and a 0:1 loss at TSG Hoffenheim is the record after the restart. Although the Werkself still has one game less due to the postponed match against Hamburger SV, captain Robert Andrich was clear after the defeat in Sinsheim.\n\n\"Of course, there are situations where we as a team have to be clear: What do we want to play—and how do we want to approach the games? It doesn't help if four people are playing one way and three people another. Then you can't win anything,\" he said in an interview with 'ZDF'.\n\nCoach Kasper Hjulmand is now challenged to ensure that everyone pulls together again in the future. So that the upcoming packed weeks don't go wrong for Leverkusen.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "The standout fixture in the penultimate round of Champions League group-stage matches sees leaders Arsenal face off against Inter Milan on Tuesday.\n\nWith progress into the knockout stages already assured, the visitors will head to Italy aiming to preserve the only 100% record left in Europe’s premier club competition.\n\nSince returning from their Italian Super Cup sojourn in Saudi Arabia, where they were beaten on penalties by Bologna, Inter have put together a strong run of results to take charge of the Serie A title race.\n\nCristian Chivu’s men have won five of their last six matches, picking up 16 points from a possible 18 to sit three points clear of city rivals AC Milan.\n\nMost recently, the Nerazzuri scraped past Udinese 1-0 thanks to Lautaro Martinez’s 20th-minute opener at the Bluenergy Stadium on Saturday.\n\nHaving made significant strides on the domestic front over the last couple of weeks, Inter will now look to take one step closer towards securing a guaranteed spot in the UCL round of 16.\n\nSitting sixth in the league phase with 12 points from six matches, Inter are set for their toughest continental test of the season so far, although Tuesday’s hosts have a good record in this fixture, with three wins from the previous four encounters.\n\nLike Inter, Arsenal are also in the driving seat for league glory, sitting seven points clear at the top of the Premier League table.\n\nWhile Mikel Arteta’s men would have been disappointed not have fully capitalised on Manchester City’s derby defeat to Manchester United, Saturday’s goalless stalemate against Nottingham Forest extended their unbeaten run to 11 matches across all competitions.\n\nThis kicked off with a 3-0 thrashing of Club Brugge in Arsenal’s last Champions League outing, leaving them with 18 points from a possible 18, three clear of Bayern Munich in second place.\n\nArsenal have already beaten Bayern and Atletico Madrid in the UCL this season, and the Gunners will be confident of making another statement of intent against heavyweight opponents.\n\nOnly Tuesday’s visitors have conceded fewer goals (one) than their hosts (four), suggesting that a low-scoring affair is on the cards here.",

The Belgian forward had attracted the interest of Atlético Madrid, but a move in January now appears to be unlikely, with the La Liga club now turning their focuses to signing a midfielder following the departure of Conor Gallagher to Tottenham.\n\nWhilst a move in the immediate future looks unlikely, the striker isn’t short of potential suitors ahead of a move in the summer transfer window. Premier League clubs including Newcastle United, West Ham United and Crystal Palace are all admirers of the 20-year-old. However, it is believed that the Les Dogues attacker favours a move to Spain.\n\nThe Ligue 1 club are unwilling to let one of their key attackers leave in the winter window following Hamza Igamane’s long-term injury. To deter interested clubs, the French outfit have set an asking price of €40m for Fernandez-Pardo.",

In 2024, Indiana extended their partnership with Adidas, which will run until 2034.\n\nIt might be confusing, but even though the Hurricanes will be playing at home, they have been designated the away team.

The significance of this for those who are superstitious, Miami has not lost a game this season in these uniforms. In fact, they are 5-0 on the season and wore the same all-whites in their playoff wins over Texas A&M and Ohio State.\n\nDespite this being an \"away\" game, it will feel anything but that for the Hurricanes. The university put out a statement to those planning on attending, encouraging the Hurricanes faithful to wear orange.\n\nThis will undoubtedly produce a striking contrast with the all-white uniforms on the field.",

    "description": "McGregor has not fought since 2021, when he suffered a broken leg, and he is desperate to compete at the White House in June",
    "fullText": "Conor McGregor has claimed his UFC contract is “void” and due to be renegotiated, as the mixed martial arts promotion enters a new broadcast era.\n\nSaturday will bring UFC 324, the company’s first event to stream live on Paramount+, after the UFC parted ways with ESPN at the end of 2025.\n\nAnd McGregor has suggested that this new broadcast deal, which marks the end of the UFC’s pay-per-view (PPV) model, means he is due to renegotiate his contract with the promotion.\n\n“They’ve got a new deal with Paramount... and my contract essentially is void right now, because there’s no more PPV, whereas my contract was based on PPV sales,” McGregor claimed on a live stream with Caylus on Sunday.\n\n“I’m the highest-generating PPV fighter of all time [in the UFC],” the former champion continued. “The PPV system is done. I’m due a new contract.\n\n“So, we’re going into negotiations in February, and I’m very interested to see how it goes.”\n\nMcGregor, 37, has not fought since July 2021, when he suffered a broken leg in a second straight loss to Dustin Poirier. However, the Irishman has long been keen on an in-ring return, and he has his eyes on the UFC’s planned White House event in June.\n\nYet UFC president Dana White has been non-committal. “We’ll see if Conor’s going to come back or not,” was his latest comment on the prospect of McGregor fighting on the South Lawn, while he was adamant that the former dual-weight champion will not face Michael Chandler.\n\n“No, that was a couple years ago,” said White, referencing the fact that McGregor and Chandler were linked in 2023 and were close to fighting in 2024, only for McGregor to withdraw from the bout on two weeks’ notice due to a broken toe. White said last week he would “not entertain” McGregor vs Chandler.\n\nStill, McGregor pushes for a return in the coming months, and he tweeted on Sunday: “The body of work I have put in to date, along with its depth, is timeless. I really feel younger and fresher than ever, and only still warming up. You will doubt me at your own peril.”\n\nMcGregor can not compete before April, with the Irishman currently serving an anti-doping ban due to multiple whereabouts failures. The 18-month suspension, which was announced in October, is backdated to September 2023, when McGregor recorded his third whereabouts failure.\n\nWith McGregor free to return in spring, however, and with White ruling out Chandler as an opponent, talk has turned to whom “Notorious” might face.\n\nOne name that has been mentioned in the MMA world is Jorge Masvidal, with whom McGregor was briefly linked several years ago.\n\nMasvidal retired from MMA in 2023 after a fourth consecutive loss, and he has since boxed once, losing to old rival Nate Diaz – whom Masvidal stopped in the UFC in 2019.\n\n“You never know, right?” the America, 41, told MMA Junkie last week, discussing a possible fight with McGregor. “I can say some big news. I have some fight news coming soon, and it’s very big news. I can’t deny or confirm what you just said.\n\n“You’ve got to just let the chips fall where they may, but definitely some big news headed towards the MMA community. Combination of things. I can’t... Some of it is like, level 5-only access, so I can’t really say too much, but I am training for something big, I can say that.\n\n“I can’t deny or confirm any of that right now, but maybe hopefully soon I can. I don’t know, I would want to say soon – like, maybe 10 days, something like that, I should have more confirmation on it.\n\n“I wouldn’t mind getting out there and f***ing doing my thing on the White House. That’s the only fight I come back for [...] I’m [US president Donald] Trump’s favourite fighter, that’s all you’ve got to keep in mind. Just remember that at all times.”",

    "fullText": "A plush toy horse designed as a cheerful Chinese New Year mascot has galloped into unexpected popularity — with an ironic twist.\n\nCreated for the upcoming Year of the Horse in the Chinese zodiac, it was originally meant to wear an upturned smile. Instead, due to a production error at a factory in Yiwu, Zhejiang province — widely known as the world's capital of small commodities — the toy left the assembly line with its mouth stitched into a distinct, down-turned pout.\n\n\"It was simply a worker's mistake — the mouth was sewn upside down,\" factory owner Zhang Huoqing said in an interview on Friday.\n\nThe story began when a social media user in Hangzhou, the provincial capital, received the flawed toy and contacted customer service to request a replacement. After posting photos of its melancholic expression online, the plush unexpectedly surged to fame.\n\nNetizens quickly dubbed it the \"cry-cry horse\", and demand for the \"accidental edition\" flooded in. By Sunday, the hashtag #YiwuCryCry-HorseGoneViral had garnered about 100 million views on the social media platform Sina Weibo.\n\nThe toy's forlorn pout, paired with determined eyes, was swiftly embraced as a \"cyber mouthpiece\" for a generation of office workers. It embodies a collective sentiment of maintaining outward composure while enduring internal pressure — a feeling often described by the popular term \"cattle-and-horse\", a euphemism for being overworked.\n\n\"It's a true depiction of the 'cattle-and-horse' mindset,\" one user wrote. Another added, \"It's quite adorable and looks really stubborn. For the Year of the Horse, let's make it a determined and hardworking one.\"\n\nWang Bin, a professor of social media communication at Renmin University of China, interpreted the trend as a psychological response to widespread social fatigue. He said the plush toy functions as an emotional anchor for consumers grappling with uncertainty and daily pressures.\n\n\"Everyone feels exhausted and faces many uncertainties about the future,\" Wang said, adding that the toy serves as a form of emotional comfort that people can buy.\n\nThe factory in Yiwu seized the moment with remarkable speed, pivoting production almost overnight. The number of assembly lines dedicated to the toy expanded from two to more than 10, with workers now meticulously trained to replicate the signature \"sad\" mouth — the very flaw they had once been instructed to avoid.\n\nThe identity of the original artisan responsible for the error remains unknown. Zhang said the company would award a bonus to the entire production team in recognition of their role in the toy's unexpected success.\n\nDespite the frenzy, the company has pledged to keep the retail price fixed at 25 yuan ($3.5).\n\nIts rapid rise to popularity underscores a shifting industrial paradigm whereby manufacturers increasingly prioritize consumer feedback, turning sentiment into a key factor in new product launches, said Zhu Huasheng, a professor at Beijing Normal University who studies industrial clusters.\n\n\"The success is not just about supply chain agility,\" Zhu said. \"The internet-driven thinking of vendors played a major role.\"\n\nHe pointed to Yiwu — known as the \"world's supermarket\" — as a prime example of how online sentiment can now be translated almost instantly into physical products.\n\nFor decades, Yiwu has relied on flexible networks of small suppliers capable of rapid retooling and small-batch production. What has changed, Zhu said, is the addition of a digital layer. Social media and online platforms now provide real-time, high-resolution data on niche emotional trends, allowing factories to identify and validate new market signals almost overnight.\n\n\"Consumers, especially young people, are no longer passive buyers but active participants,\" he said.\"Their emotional expressions can directly shape what gets made.\"\n\nThe \"cry-cry horse\" illustrates this system in action. Yiwu's sprawling commercial complex, home to more than 75,000 wholesale booths, has long served as a bellwether for disposable consumer trends and a sourcing base for global bargain retailers.\n\nHowever, the toy industry remains notoriously fickle, and viral crazes often last only months. Zhu said manufacturers in Yiwu are keenly aware of the \"burst\" nature of internet trends. Their strategy centers on hyper-agile production — riding the wave at its peak and winding down quickly.\n\nLow per-unit costs help minimize financial risk, and the dense local supply network allows labor and materials to be swiftly redirected to other products. Ultimately, Zhu said, the strength of such hubs lies less in predicting a trend's longevity than in mastering the logistics of a short life cycle — maximizing returns within a narrow window before enthusiasm fades.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Letter signed by figures on right and left of party says UK should follow Australia’s example by enacting ban\n\nMore than 60 Labour MPs have written to Keir Starmer urging him to back a social media ban for under-16s, with peers due to vote on the issue this week.\n\nThe MPs, who include select committee chairs, former frontbenchers and MPs from the right and left of the party, are looking to put pressure on the prime minister as calls mount for the UK to follow Australia’s precedent.\n\nStarmer has said he is open to a ban but members of the House of Lords are looking to force the issue when they vote this week on an amendment to the children, wellbeing and schools bill that would enact one within a year of the bill passing.\n\nThe vote could pit Labour peers against the prime minister, who is understood to want to wait to assess the evidence from the Australian ban, which came into force in December.\n\nIn the letter, which was organised by Fred Thomas, the Labour MP for Plymouth Moor View, the MPs say: “Across our constituencies, we hear the same message: children are anxious, unhappy, and unable to focus on learning. They are not building the social skills needed to thrive, nor having the experiences that will prepare them for adulthood.”\n\nThey add: “Around the world, governments are recognising the severity of this crisis and taking action.” Noting existing or pending legislation in Australia, Denmark, France, Norway, New Zealand and Greece, they say: “We believe the onus must be placed on technology platforms, not parents, to prevent underage access. We would support a model similar to Australia’s that requires companies to take meaningful steps to enforce age limits.”\n\nThey conclude: “We urge the government to show leadership on this issue by introducing a minimum age for social media access of 16 years old.”\n\nThe signatories of the letter represent a wide spectrum of opinion within the party. They include Helen Hayes, the chair of the education select committee, and Florence Eshalomi, the chair of the housing and local government committee.\n\nOthers include Vicky Foxcroft, the former whip who helped lead the rebellion against the government’s proposed welfare cuts, and Catherine McKinnell, a former education minister. The letter has support from some on the left of the party such as Richard Burgon, and on the right such as the prominent “blue Labour” MP Jonathan Hinder.\n\nThe weight of Commons support for a ban will put further pressure on the prime minister, who has previously been sceptical about whether such a move would work, but who told MPs at a recent meeting that he would be open to one in theory.\n\nIn recent days, government figures have stressed they are concerned that a ban could force children on to the dark web, and they want to see more evidence before committing to enforcing one in the UK.\n\nOne source close to Starmer said: “In principle, Keir is in favour of a ban. We can all see the dangers and worry about what is happening to young people’s minds. But there are still big obstacles to overcome with implementation. We can already see that from Australia. We need to take our time and make sure we get this right.”\n\nA Downing Street figure suggested Starmer could give a ban his symbolic support soon, but the government would then take its time over implementation, “ironing out” any difficulties first.\n\nThey said: “It’s Keir’s direction of travel but there’s lots of hurdles to overcome first. We’re not going to rush into this.”\n\nLisa Nandy, the culture secretary, told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday: “There are strong arguments for banning under-16s from social media but there are also real concerns raised by the NSPCC and others about whether it pushes children to darker, less-regulated places on the internet.”\n\nThose arguments were reinforced over the weekend by Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, the teenager who took her own life after looking at suicide content online. Russell told the BBC’s Newscast he opposed what he called “sledgehammer-like techniques like bans”.\n\nThe prime minister’s position will be put to the test this week when peers vote on an amendment by the Conservative member John Nash to the children wellbeing and schools bill proposing enacting an age limit within 12 months of the bill’s passage.\n\nLabour has not said how it intends to vote on the issue yet but several peers are expected to support it regardless of whips’ instructions.\n\nThey include the former MP Luciana Berger, who has co-signed Nash’s amendment. She told the Guardian: “The proposal for raising the social media age limit for under-16s enjoys huge support – across the country and within the Labour party. Social media is catastrophically harming children and we must act now to protect them. I urge peers to back our amendment on Wednesday so we can give young people their childhood back.”",

    "description": "AI is asbestos in the walls of our tech society, stuffed there by monopolists run amok. A serious fight against it must strike at its roots\nI am a science-fiction writer, which means that my job is to make up futuristic parables about our current techno-social arrangements to interrogate not just what a gadget does, but who it does it for, and who it does it to.\nWhat I do not do is predict the future.

    "fullText": "I am a science-fiction writer, which means that my job is to make up futuristic parables about our current techno-social arrangements to interrogate not just what a gadget does, but who it does it for, and who it does it to.\n\nWhat I do not do is predict the future. No one can predict the future, which is a good thing, since if the future were predictable, that would mean we couldn’t change it.\n\nNow, not everyone understands the distinction. They think science-fiction writers are oracles. Even some of my colleagues labor under the delusion that we can “see the future”.\n\nThen there are science-fiction fans who believe that they are reading the future. A depressing number of those people appear to have become AI bros. These guys can’t shut up about the day that their spicy autocomplete machine will wake up and turn us all into paperclips has led many confused journalists and conference organizers to try to get me to comment on the future of AI.\n\nThat’s something I used to strenuously resist doing, because I wasted two years of my life explaining patiently and repeatedly why I thought crypto was stupid, and getting relentlessly bollocked by cryptocurrency cultists who at first insisted that I just didn’t understand crypto. And then, when I made it clear that I did understand crypto, they insisted that I must be a paid shill.\n\nThis is literally what happens when you argue with Scientologists, and life is just too short. That said, people would not stop asking – so I’m going to explain what I think about AI and how to be a good AI critic. By which I mean: “How to be a critic whose criticism inflicts maximum damage on the parts of AI that are doing the most harm.”\n\nIn automation theory, a “centaur” is a person who is assisted by a machine. Driving a car makes you a centaur, and so does using autocomplete.\n\nA reverse centaur is a machine head on a human body, a person who is serving as a squishy meat appendage for an uncaring machine.\n\nFor example, an Amazon delivery driver, who sits in a cabin surrounded by AI cameras that monitor the driver’s eyes and take points off if the driver looks in a proscribed direction, and monitors the driver’s mouth because singing is not allowed on the job, and rats the driver out to the boss if they do not make quota.\n\nThe driver is in that van because the van cannot drive itself and cannot get a parcel from the curb to your porch. The driver is a peripheral for a van, and the van drives the driver, at superhuman speed, demanding superhuman endurance.\n\nObviously, it’s nice to be a centaur, and it’s horrible to be a reverse centaur. There are lots of AI tools that are potentially very centaurlike, but my thesis is that these tools are created and funded for the express purpose of creating reverse centaurs, which none of us want to be.\n\nBut like I said, the job of a science-fiction writer is to do more than think about what the gadget does, and drill down on who the gadget does it for and who the gadget does it to. Tech bosses want us to believe that there is only one way a technology can be used. Mark Zuckerberg wants you to think that it is technologically impossible to have a conversation with a friend without him listening in. Tim Cook wants you to think that it is impossible for you to have a reliable computing experience unless he gets a veto over which software you install and without him taking 30 cents out of every dollar you spend. Sundar Pichai wants you to think that it is for you to find a webpage unless he gets to spy on you from asshole to appetite.\n\nThis is all a kind of vulgar Thatcherism. Margaret Thatcher’s mantra was: “There is no alternative.” She repeated this so often they called her “Tina” Thatcher: There. Is. No. Alternative.\n\n“There is no alternative” is a cheap rhetorical slight. It’s a demand dressed up as an observation. “There is no alternative” means: “stop trying to think of an alternative.”\n\nI’m a science-fiction writer – my job is to think of a dozen alternatives before breakfast.\n\nSo let me explain what I think is going on here with this AI bubble and who the reverse-centaur army is serving, and sort out the bullshit from the material reality.\n\nStart with monopolies: tech companies are gigantic and they don’t compete, they just take over whole sectors, either on their own or in cartels.\n\nGoogle and Meta control the ad market. Google and Apple control the mobile market, and Google pays Apple more than $20bn a year not to make a competing search engine, and of course, Google has a 90% search market share.\n\nNow, you would think that this was good news for the tech companies, owning their whole sector.\n\nBut it’s actually a crisis. You see, when a company is growing, it is a “growth stock”, and investors really like growth stocks. When you buy a share in a growth stock, you are making a bet that it will continue to grow. So growth stocks trade at a huge multiple of their earnings. This is called the “price to earnings ratio” or “PE ratio”.\n\nBut once a company stops growing, it is a “mature” stock, and it trades at a much lower PE ratio. So for every dollar that Target – a mature company – brings in, it is worth $10. It has a PE ratio of 10, while Amazon has a PE ratio of 36, which means that for every dollar Amazon brings in, the market values it at $36.\n\nIt’s wonderful to run a company that has a growth stock. Your shares are as good as money. If you want to buy another company or hire a key worker, you can offer stock instead of cash. And stock is very easy for companies to get, because shares are manufactured right there on the premises, all you have to do is type some zeros into a spreadsheet, while dollars are much harder to come by. A company can only get dollars from customers or creditors.\n\nSo when Amazon bids against Target for a key acquisition or a key hire, Amazon can bid with shares they make by typing zeros into a spreadsheet, and Target can only bid with dollars they get from selling stuff to us or taking out loans, which is why Amazon generally wins those bidding wars.\n\nThat’s the upside of having a growth stock. But here is the downside: eventually a company has to stop growing. Like, say you get a 90% market share in your sector, how are you going to grow?\n\nIf you are an exec at a dominant company with a growth stock, you have to live in constant fear that the market will decide that you are not likely to grow any further. Think of what happened to Facebook in the first quarter of 2022. They told investors that they experienced slightly slower growth in the US than they had anticipated, and investors panicked. They staged a one-day, $240bn sell-off. A quarter-trillion dollars in 24 hours! At the time, it was the largest, most precipitous drop in corporate valuation in human history.\n\nThat’s a monopolist’s worst nightmare, because once you’re presiding over a “mature” firm, the key employees you have been compensating with stock experience a precipitous pay drop and bolt for the exits, so you lose the people who might help you grow again, and you can only hire their replacements with dollars – not shares.\n\nThis is the paradox of the growth stock. While you are growing to domination, the market loves you, but once you achieve dominance, the market lops 75% or more off your value in a single stroke if they do not trust your pricing power.\n\nWhich is why growth-stock companies are always desperately pumping up one bubble or another, spending billions to hype the pivot to video or cryptocurrency or NFTs or the metaverse or AI.\n\nI am not saying that tech bosses are making bets they do not plan on winning. But winning the bet – creating a viable metaverse – is the secondary goal. The primary goal is to keep the market convinced that your company will continue to grow, and to remain convinced until the next bubble comes along.\n\nSo this is why they’re hyping AI: the material basis for the hundreds of billions in AI investment.\n\nNow I want to talk about how they’re selling AI. The growth narrative of AI is that AI will disrupt labor markets. I use “disrupt” here in its most disreputable tech-bro sense.\n\nThe promise of AI – the promise AI companies make to investors – is that there will be AI that can do your job, and when your boss fires you and replaces you with AI, he will keep half of your salary for himself and give the other half to the AI company.\n\nThat is the $13tn growth story that Morgan Stanley is telling. It’s why big investors are giving AI companies hundreds of billions of dollars. And because they are piling in, normies are also getting sucked in, risking their retirement savings and their family’s financial security.\n\nNow, if AI could do your job, this would still be a problem. We would have to figure out what to do with all these unemployed people.\n\nBut AI can’t do your job. It can help you do your job, but that does not mean it is going to save anyone money.\n\nTake radiology: there is some evidence that AI can sometimes identify solid-mass tumors that some radiologists miss. Look, I’ve got cancer. Thankfully, it’s very treatable, but I’ve got an interest in radiology being as reliable and accurate as possible.\n\nLet’s say my hospital bought some AI radiology tools and told its radiologists: “Hey folks, here’s the deal. Today, you’re processing about 100 X-rays per day. From now on, we’re going to get an instantaneous second opinion from the AI, and if the AI thinks you’ve missed a tumor, we want you to go back and have another look, even if that means you’re only processing 98 X-rays per day. That’s fine, we just care about finding all those tumors.”\n\nIf that’s what they said, I’d be delighted. But no one is investing hundreds of billions in AI companies because they think AI will make radiology more expensive, not even if that also makes radiology more accurate. The market’s bet on AI is that an AI salesman will visit the CEO of Kaiser and make this pitch: “Look, you fire nine out of 10 of your radiologists, saving $20m a year. You give us $10m a year, and you net $10m a year, and the remaining radiologists’ job will be to oversee the diagnoses the AI makes at superhuman speed – and somehow remain vigilant as they do so, despite the fact that the AI is usually right, except when it’s catastrophically wrong.\n\n“And if the AI misses a tumor, this will be the human radiologist’s fault, because they are the ‘human in the loop’. It’s their signature on the diagnosis.”\n\nThis is a reverse centaur, and it is a specific kind of reverse centaur: it is what Dan Davies calls an “accountability sink”. The radiologist’s job is not really to oversee the AI’s work, it is to take the blame for the AI’s mistakes.\n\nThis is another key to understanding – and thus deflating – the AI bubble. The AI can’t do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can’t do your job. This is key because it helps us build the kinds of coalitions that will be successful in the fight against the AI bubble.\n\nIf you are someone who is worried about cancer, and you are being told that the price of making radiology too cheap to meter, is that we are going to have to rehouse America’s 32,000 radiologists, with the trade-off that no one will ever be denied radiology services again, you might say: “Well, OK, I’m sorry for those radiologists, and I fully support getting them job training or UBI or whatever. But the point of radiology is to fight cancer, not to pay radiologists, so I know what side I’m on.”\n\nAI hucksters and their customers in the C-suites want the public on their side. They want to forge a class alliance between AI deployers and the people who enjoy the fruits of the reverse centaurs’ labor. They want us to think of ourselves as enemies to the workers.\n\nNow, some people will be on the workers’ side because of politics or aesthetics. But if you want to win over all the people who benefit from your labor, you need to understand and stress how the products of the AI will be substandard. That they are going to get charged more for worse things. That they have a shared material interest with you.\n\nWill those products be substandard? There is every reason to think so.\n\nThink of AI software generation: there are plenty of coders who love using AI. Using AI for simple tasks can genuinely make them more efficient and give them more time to do the fun part of coding, namely, solving really gnarly, abstract puzzles. But when you listen to business leaders talk about their AI plans for coders, it’s clear they are not hoping to make some centaurs.\n\nThey want to fire a lot of tech workers – 500,000 over the past three years – and make the rest pick up their work with coding, which is only possible if you let the AI do all the gnarly, creative problem solving, and then you do the most boring, soul-crushing part of the job: reviewing the AI’s code.\n\nAnd because AI is just a word-guessing program, because all it does is calculate the most probable word to go next, the errors it makes are especially subtle and hard to spot, because these bugs are nearly indistinguishable from working code.\n\nFor example: programmers routinely use standard “code libraries” to handle routine tasks. Say you want your program to slurp in a document and make some kind of sense of it – find all the addresses, say, or all the credit card numbers. Rather than writing a program to break down a document into its constituent parts, you’ll just grab a library that does it for you.\n\nThese libraries come in families, and they have predictable names. If it’s a library for pulling in an html file, it might be called something like lib.html.text.parsing; and if it’s a for docx file, it’ll be lib.docx.text.parsing.\n\nBut reality is messy, humans are inattentive and stuff goes wrong, so sometimes, there will be another library, say, one for parsing pdfs, and instead of being called lib.pdf.text.parsing, it’s called lib.text.pdf.parsing. Someone just entered an incorrect library name and it stuck. Like I said, the world is messy.\n\nNow, AI is a statistical inference engine. All it can do is predict what word will come next based on all the words that have been typed in the past. That means that it will “hallucinate” a library called lib.pdf.text.parsing, because that matches the pattern it’s already seen. And the thing is, malicious hackers know that the AI will make this error, so they will go out and create a library with the predictable, hallucinated name, and that library will get automatically sucked into the AI’s program, and it will do things like steal user data or try to penetrate other computers on the same network.\n\nAnd you, the human in the loop – the reverse centaur – you have to spot this subtle, hard-to-find error, this bug that is indistinguishable from correct code. Now, maybe a senior coder could catch this, because they have been around the block a few times, and they know about this tripwire.\n\nBut guess who tech bosses want to preferentially fire and replace with AI? Senior coders. Those mouthy, entitled, extremely highly paid workers, who don’t think of themselves as workers. Who see themselves as founders in waiting, peers of the company’s top management. The kind of coder who would lead a walkout over the company building drone-targeting systems for the Pentagon, which cost Google $10bn in 2018.\n\nFor AI to be valuable, it has to replace high-wage workers, and those are precisely the workers who might spot some of those statistically camouflaged AI errors.\n\nIf you can replace coders with AI, who can’t you replace with AI? Firing coders is an ad for AI.\n\nWhich brings me to AI art – or “art” – which is often used as an ad for AI, even though it is not part of AI’s business model.\n\nLet me explain: on average, illustrators do not make any money. They are already one of the most immiserated, precarious groups of workers out there. If AI image-generators put every illustrator working today out of a job, the resulting wage-bill savings would be undetectable as a proportion of all the costs associated with training and operating image-generators. The total wage bill for commercial illustrators is less than the kombucha bill for the company cafeteria at just one of OpenAI’s campuses.\n\nThe purpose of AI art – and the story of AI art as a death knell for artists – is to convince the broad public that AI is amazing and will do amazing things. It is to create buzz. Which is not to say that it is not disgusting that former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati told a conference audience that “some creative jobs shouldn’t have been there in the first place”.\n\nIt’s supposed to be disgusting. It’s supposed to get artists to run around and say: “The AI can do my job, and it’s going to steal my job, and isn’t that terrible?“\n\nBut can AI do an illustrator’s job? Or any artist’s job?\n\nLet’s think about that for a second. I have been a working artist since I was 17 years old, when I sold my first short story. Here’s what I think art is: it starts with an artist, who has some vast, complex, numinous, irreducible feeling in their mind. And the artist infuses that feeling into some artistic medium. They make a song, a poem, a painting, a drawing, a dance, a book or a photograph. And the idea is, when you experience this work, a facsimile of the big, numinous, irreducible feeling will materialize in your mind.\n\nBut the image-generation program does not know anything about your big, numinous, irreducible feeling. The only thing it knows is whatever you put into your prompt, and those few sentences are diluted across a million pixels or a hundred-thousand words, so that the average communicative density of the resulting work is indistinguishable from zero.\n\nIt is possible to infuse more communicative intent into a work: writing more detailed prompts, or doing the selective work of choosing from among many variants, or directly tinkering with the AI image after the fact, with a paintbrush or Photoshop or the Gimp. And if there will ever be a piece of AI art that is good art – as opposed to merely striking, interesting or an example of good draftsmanship – it will be thanks to those additional infusions of creative intent by a human.\n\nAnd in the meantime, it’s bad art. It’s bad art in the sense of being “eerie”, the word that cultural theorist Mark Fisher used to describe “when there is something present where there should be nothing, or there is nothing present when there should be something”.\n\nAI art is eerie because it seems like there is an intender and an intention behind every word and every pixel, because we have a lifetime of experience that tells us that paintings have painters, and writing has writers. But it is missing something. It has nothing to say, or whatever it has to say is so diluted that it is undetectable.\n\nWe should not simply shrug our shoulders and accept Thatcherism’s fatalism: “There is no alternative.”\n\nSo what is the alternative? A lot of artists and their allies think they have an answer: they say we should extend copyright to cover the activities associated with training a model.\n\nAnd I am here to tell you they are wrong. Wrong because this would represent a massive expansion of copyright over activities that are currently permitted – for good reason. I’ll explain:\n\nAI training involves scraping a bunch of webpages, which is unambiguously legal under present copyright law. Next, you perform analysis on those works. Basically, you count stuff on them: count pixels and their colors and proximity to other pixels; or count words. This is obviously not something you need a license for.\n\nAnd after you count all the pixels or the words, it is time for the final step: publishing them. Because that is what a model is: a literary work (that is, a piece of software) that embodies a bunch of facts about a bunch of other works, word and pixel distribution information, encoded in a multidimensional array.\n\nAnd again, copyright absolutely does not prohibit you from publishing facts about copyrighted works. And again, no one should want to live in a world where someone else gets to decide which factual statements you can publish.\n\nBut hey, maybe you think this is all sophistry. Maybe you think I’m full of shit. That’s fine. It wouldn’t be the first time someone thought that.\n\nAfter all, even if I’m right about how copyright works now, there’s no reason we couldn’t change copyright to ban training activities, and maybe there’s even a clever way to wordsmith the law so that it only catches bad things we don’t like, and not all the good stuff that comes from scraping, analyzing and publishing – such as search engines and academic scholarship.\n\nWell, even then, you’re not gonna help out creators by creating this new copyright. We have monotonically expanded copyright since 1976, so that today, copyright covers more kinds of works, grants exclusive rights over more uses, and lasts longer.\n\nAnd today, the media industry is larger and more profitable than it has ever been, and also – the share of media industry income that goes to creative workers is lower than it has ever been, both in real terms, and as a proportion of those incredible gains made by creators’ bosses at the media company.\n\nIn a creative market dominated by five publishers, four studios, three labels, two mobile app stores, and a single company that controls all the ebooks and audiobooks, giving a creative worker extra rights to bargain with is like giving your bullied kid more lunch money.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how much lunch money you give the kid, the bullies will take it all. Give that kid enough money and the bullies will hire an agency to run a global campaign proclaiming: “Think of the hungry kids! Give them more lunch money!”\n\nCreative workers who cheer on lawsuits by the big studios and labels need to remember the first rule of class warfare: things that are good for your boss are rarely what’s good for you.\n\nA new copyright to train models will not get us a world where models are not used to destroy artists, it will just get us a world where the standard contracts of the handful of companies that control all creative labor markets are updated to require us to hand over those new training rights to those companies. Demanding a new copyright just makes you a useful idiot for your boss.\n\nWhen really what they’re demanding is a world where 30% of the investment capital of the AI companies go into their shareholders’ pockets. When an artist is being devoured by rapacious monopolies, does it matter how they divvy up the meal?\n\nWe need to protect artists from AI predation, not just create a new way for artists to be mad about their impoverishment.\n\nIncredibly enough, there is a really simple way to do that. After more than 20 years of being consistently wrong and terrible for artists’ rights, the US Copyright Office has finally done something gloriously, wonderfully right. All through this AI bubble, the Copyright Office has maintained – correctly – that AI-generated works cannot be copyrighted, because copyright is exclusively for humans. That is why the “monkey selfie” is in the public domain. Copyright is only awarded to works of human creative expression that are fixed in a tangible medium.\n\nAnd not only has the Copyright Office taken this position, they have defended it vigorously in court, repeatedly winning judgments to uphold this principle.\n\nThe fact that every AI-created work is in the public domain means that if Getty or Disney or Universal or Hearst newspapers use AI to generate works – then anyone else can take those works, copy them, sell them or give them away for nothing. And the only thing those companies hate more than paying creative workers, is having other people take their stuff without permission.\n\nThe US Copyright Office’s position means that the only way these companies can get a copyright is to pay humans to do creative work. This is a recipe for centaurhood. If you are a visual artist or writer who uses prompts to come up with ideas or variations, that’s no problem, because the ultimate work comes from you. And if you are a video editor who uses deepfakes to change the eyelines of 200 extras in a crowd scene, then sure, those eyeballs are in the public domain, but the movie stays copyrighted.\n\nBut creative workers do not have to rely on the US government to rescue us from AI predators. We can do it ourselves, the way the writers did in their historic writers’ strike. The writers brought the studios to their knees. They did it because they are organized and solidaristic, but also are allowed to do something that virtually no other workers are allowed to do: they can engage in “sectoral bargaining”, whereby all the workers in a sector can negotiate a contract with every employer in the sector.\n\nThat has been illegal for most workers since the late 1940s, when the Taft-Hartley Act outlawed it. If we are gonna campaign to get a new law passed in hopes of making more money and having more control over our labor, we should campaign to restore sectoral bargaining, not to expand copyright.\n\nAI is a bubble and bubbles are terrible.\n\nBubbles transfer the life savings of normal people who are just trying to have a dignified retirement to the wealthiest and most unethical people in our society, and every bubble eventually bursts, taking their savings with it.\n\nBut not every bubble is created equal. Some bubbles leave behind something productive. Worldcom stole billions from everyday people by defrauding them about orders for fiber optic cables. The CEO went to prison and died there. But the fiber outlived him. It’s still in the ground. At my home, I’ve got 2gb symmetrical fiber, because AT&T lit up some of that old Worldcom dark fiber.\n\nIt would have been better if Worldcom had not ever existed, but the only thing worse than Worldcom committing all that ghastly fraud would be if there was nothing to salvage from the wreckage.\n\nI do not think we will salvage much from cryptocurrency, for example. When crypto dies, what it will leave behind is bad Austrian economics and worse monkey jpegs.\n\nAI is a bubble and it will burst. Most of the companies will fail. Most of the datacenters will be shuttered or sold for parts. So what will be left behind?\n\nWe will have a bunch of coders who are really good at applied statistics. We will have a lot of cheap GPUs, which will be good news for, say, effects artists and climate scientists, who will be able to buy that critical hardware at pennies on the dollar. And we will have the open-source models that run on commodity hardware, AI tools that can do a lot of useful stuff, like transcribing audio and video; describing images; summarizing documents; and automating a lot of labor-intensive graphic editing – such as removing backgrounds or airbrushing passersby out of photos. These will run on our laptops and phones, and open-source hackers will find ways to push them to do things their makers never dreamed of.\n\nIf there had never been an AI bubble, if all this stuff arose merely because computer scientists and product managers noodled around for a few years coming up with cool new apps, most people would have been pleasantly surprised with these interesting new things their computers could do. We would call them “plugins”.\n\nIt’s the bubble that sucks, not these applications. The bubble doesn’t want cheap useful things. It wants expensive, “disruptive” things: big foundation models that lose billions of dollars every year.\n\nWhen the AI-investment mania halts, most of those models are going to disappear, because it just won’t be economical to keep the datacenters running. As Stein’s law has it: “Anything that can’t go on forever eventually stops.”\n\nThe collapse of the AI bubble is going to be ugly. Seven AI companies currently account for more than a third of the stock market, and they endlessly pass around the same $100bn IOU.\n\nAI is the asbestos in the walls of our technological society, stuffed there with wild abandon by a finance sector and tech monopolists run amok. We will be excavating it for a generation or more.\n\nTo pop the bubble, we have to hammer on the forces that created the bubble: the myth that AI can do your job, especially if you get high wages that your boss can claw back; the understanding that growth companies need a succession of ever more outlandish bubbles to stay alive; the fact that workers and the public they serve are on one side of this fight, and bosses and their investors are on the other side.\n\nBecause the AI bubble really is very bad news, it’s worth fighting seriously, and a serious fight against AI strikes at its roots: the material factors fueling the hundreds of billions in wasted capital that are being spent to put us all on the breadline and fill all our walls with hi-tech asbestos.\n\nCory Doctorow is a science fiction author, activist and journalist.

    "fullText": "A product manager at Meta says vibe coding has changed what it means to do his job — even though he has no technical background and still finds code \"terrifying.\"\n\nZevi Arnovitz said in an episode of \"Lenny's Podcast\" released Sunday that discovering AI coding tools in mid-2024 marked a turning point in his career.\n\nIt felt like he was handed \"superpowers,\" Arnovitz said.\n\nUnderstanding how to use AI intentionally is \"one of the biggest game changers that will make you much better as a PM,\" he said, referring to product management.\n\nArnovitz joined Meta in September last year after about three years as a product manager at website-building company Wix, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nArnovitz said he has rebuilt his workflow around AI. He uses vibe coding tools like Cursor alongside models from Anthropic and Google to explore product ideas, generate build plans, execute code, review it, and update documentation.\n\nThe shift reshaped his role as a product manager. Instead of merely acting as a coordinator between engineering and design, Arnovitz operates more like a product owner with the capability to execute.\n\n\"Everyone's going to become a builder,\" he said. \"We're going to see that a lot in the next coming years.\"\n\nStill, Arnovitz said there are limits to what non-technical product managers should take on. He said he doesn't think product managers should be shipping complex infrastructure changes or big projects.\n\nAI has enabled product managers to take on smaller UI projects by building the feature and then handing the code to a developer for final review and completion, he added.\n\nAs AI tools improve, Arnovitz said titles and responsibilities are likely to \"collapse,\" and product managers should treat vibe coding as a \"collaborative learning opportunity\" with their engineering teams.\n\nThe rise of AI coding tools is blurring the lines for traditional roles, making it easier for non-technical workers, including product managers, to build products directly.\n\nFigma CEO Dylan Field said in October on \"Lenny's Podcast\" that AI has pushed many workers to experiment with building products.\n\nTasks that once required deep engineering expertise can now be done with vibe coding tools, he said.\n\n\"I think that we're seeing more designers, engineers, product managers, researchers, all these different folks that are involved in the product development process dip their toe into the other roles,\" he said.\n\n\"We're all product builders, and some of us are specialized in our particular area,\" he added.\n\nThat same thinking is showing up in how companies train new hires. LinkedIn replaced its long-running associate product manager program with an associate product builder track in January.\n\n\"We're going to teach them how to code, design, and PM at LinkedIn,\" said the company's former chief product officer, Tomer Cohen, in an episode of \"Lenny's Podcast\" published in December. It's more about training people \"who can flex across,\" he added.\n\nCohen, who spent nearly 14 years at LinkedIn, left the company in January and now works as an advisor, according to his LinkedIn profile.",

    "fullText": "Russia has plans to more than double production of its Iranian-designed attack drones to 1,000 per day, said Ukrainian Armed Forces' commander in chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi.\n\n\"The enemy plans to significantly increase production to use up to 1,000 drones per day,\" Syrskyi said of these drones.\n\nHe was speaking in an interview published on Sunday by the local media outlet LB.Ua, in which he commented on a wide range of topics, including the effectiveness of Ukraine's deep strikes into Russia and the balance of power in drone warfare.\n\nSyrskyi gave a precise assessment of Russia's current Shahed manufacturing, saying that Moscow can now produce 404 Shahed drones \"of various types\" every day.\n\nThese Russian delta-wing drones are closely modeled after Iran's loitering munitions. Moscow manufactures its own versions, dubbed Gerans, as well as cheaper decoys called Gerberas.\n\nRussia typically deploys a mix of strike drones and decoys when launching long-range attacks into Ukraine, and can send hundreds in a single night.\n\nSyrskyi did not say if Russia's daily Shahed production included Gerberas, nor did he break down exact production figures for each type of Shahed-type drone. The Geran-1 and Geran-2, propeller-driven drones that can fly up to 115 mph, are more common than the faster, jet-powered Geran-3.\n\nLaunching 1,000 Shahed-type drones a day would be a massive surge in Russia's attack capability. Moscow has generally been deploying 5,000 to 6,000 Shaheds a month against Ukraine, and half to four-fifths of these are usually strike variants.\n\nPer an analysis by the Institute for Science and International Security, Russia launched an average of 166 Shahed drones per day in December 2025. However, it's known to sometimes pause or reduce the intensity of its strikes to accumulate a stockpile for later use in a single large wave.\n\nCost is a major advantage for Shaheds. Each is estimated to cost between $20,000 and $70,000, making it cheaper and easier to manufacture than a conventional missile and providing Russia with a way to scale up its strike capability more sustainably.\n\nResource-strapped Ukraine has responded by seeking cheaper complements for its air defense network, including the growing use of small interceptor drones.\n\nStill, Russia's monthly use of Shahed-type drones has remained largely stagnant for the last six months. Moscow has, meanwhile, been experimenting with the loitering munitions, such as equipping them with air-to-air missiles or rear-facing cameras.\n\nSyrskyi's public assessment also comes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned on Friday that his country was running low on ammunition for Western-supplied air defense systems.\n\nZelenskyy said that Ukraine had just secured a replenished stock of those munitions, but before that, it was fielding \"several systems without missiles.\"\n\n\"Today I can say this openly, because today, I have those missiles,\" he said.\n\nAs for other drones used in the war, Syrskyi said that Russia and Ukraine were now evenly matched in production quantity. Both Kyiv and Moscow have sporadically claimed the advantage on this front in recent years.\n\n\"The question is in quality. In conventional drones, quality is on our side. In fiber optics, unfortunately, we are only catching up with the enemy,\" Syrskyi said.",

    "fullText": "FedEx's CEO said he wants \"super humanoid robots\" with a \"couple of elbows\" to automate processes in his warehouses.\n\nRaj Subramaniam, chief executive of the global e-commerce and transportation company, spoke in an interview with The New York Times, published on Sunday, about his approach to technology.\n\nSpeaking about automating certain parts of the delivery process, Subramaniam said that regular humanoid robots won't be up to the task for FedEx's warehouses.\n\n\"Truck unloading and truck loading are a very difficult problem for robotics to solve — packages come in every size, shape, and weight,\" he said.\n\nHe added, \"We're not looking for humanoid robots — we're looking for super humanoid robots, because maybe they need to have a couple of elbows. More degrees of freedom.\"\n\nThe executive said that FedEx is still in the pilot stage for these robots, and was \"not ready for prime time yet.\"\n\nBeyond humanoid robots, he said, FedEx was drilling down on AI, training on data from its 17 million deliveries daily around the world to predict delivery times for its customers accurately.\n\nSubramaniam has been the company's CEO since 2022, acting as the second CEO in the company's history. FedEx's stock is up about 11% in the past year.\n\nOther e-commerce and logistics giants, such as Amazon and GXO, have begun testing humanoid robots in their warehouses.\n\nIn August, GXO's chief automation officer told Business Insider that the company was \"going really broad and aggressive on the category.\"\n\nAnd Amazon has a fleet of more than 750,000 robots working in its fulfillment process, which help with picking, packing, and transporting packages to loading docks. A Morgan Stanley note in February wrote that the robots could save Amazon $10 billion annually by 2030.\n\nHowever, Boston Dynamics' CTO told TechCrunch in 2023 interview that the human form might not be the most ideal for a robot to complete warehouse tasks.",

    "description": "Remote work endures despite stricter RTO policies at Fortune 100 companies, as managers give the nod for more flexible arrangements.",
    "fullText": "Remote work is far from dead — it's just learned to live in the shadows.\n\nThink of a big-name company, and there's a good chance it's rolled out a return-to-office mandate in the past couple of years. Amazon, AT&T, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Paramount Skydance have adopted a five-day-a-week office mandate, while Microsoft, Intel, and Starbucks have tightened their hybrid policies.\n\nAs of the second quarter of 2025, a majority of Fortune 100 employees were subject to a full-time office mandate — up from just 5% two years prior — according to Placer.ai, a location intelligence and foot traffic data firm. Over the same period, the average number of required in-office days a week at these companies rose from 2.6 to 3.9, according to real estate consulting firm JLL.\n\nHowever, data reflecting how many US workers are actually in the office tells a different story, said Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University who studies remote work.\n\nBloom said actual work-from-home rates have remained fairly stable in recent years. He referred to it as \"work-from-home dark matter\" — a nod to the invisible material that makes up much of the universe. Like dark matter, remote work appears to be widespread, Bloom said, but may often be procured through special exceptions or flying under the radar.\n\n\"We keep hearing endless stories of companies pushing employees to return, but we just don't see much of this in the survey, swipe-card or cellphone tracking data,\" he said.\n\nFor companies, the apparent disconnect between rising return-to-office mandates and actual office attendance raises questions about whether employees and managers are complying with RTO policies. For workers, it suggests there may be more opportunities to work from home than they realize.\n\nBloom's research, published on the WFH Research website he co-founded, shows that the share of work-from-home days in the US has held fairly steady over the past two years — fluctuating between roughly 25% and 30%. Bureau of Labor Statistics data backs this up.\n\nBloom pointed to a few potential explanations for why work-from-home rates have remained resilient. One is that while fully remote arrangements have declined sharply since the height of the pandemic, hybrid setups — with employees splitting time between home and the office — have been adopted by many employers.\n\nAdditionally, Bloom hypothesized that some employees have secured exceptions that allow them to work from home more frequently than their company's official policy permits. He believes many of these arrangements are \"off the record\" — granted by individual managers without formal company approval.\n\nBloom said one reason some managers might allow these exceptions is that they're often evaluated based on their team's performance. If a manager is concerned that top employees will quit or become less productive under stricter in-office requirements, they may decide to offer more flexibility.\n\n\"Managers are allowing employees extra days at home because they are high performers or hard to replace in their jobs,\" he said, adding, \"Managers ultimately care about their team performance.\"\n\nOne of these off-the-record exceptions was granted to a Wisconsin-based mother of three who works in a corporate role at a manufacturing company. When her employer announced a five-day-a-week in-office policy in 2023, she worried a two-hour round-trip commute would make it difficult to manage her childcare responsibilities. After an \"off-the-record\" conversation with her manager, she was told that as long as she came in a few days a week — especially for key in-person meetings — they wouldn't give her any trouble.\n\n\"If I need to work from home for whatever reason, whether it's work or personal reasons, then that's OK,\" she said.\n\nNot every work-from-home exception is off the record. After struggling to make it into the office following day care drop-off, Georg Loewen, a senior director of digital marketing at a public relations agency, said his manager formally exempted him — for the time being — from the company's three-day-a-week in-office policy.\n\n\"If drop-off ran long or parking didn't work out, I'd just work from home,\" said Loewen, who's in his 30s and lives in New Jersey.\n\nLoewen said he sometimes worries about how his arrangement might be perceived by coworkers who don't have the same flexibility, but that he has consistently felt supported.\n\nBloom said he often hears about West Coast employees who are granted additional work-from-home flexibility because they have regular calls with colleagues in China or India that take place outside standard business hours. He also cited a case in which the head of a department at a Fortune 500 company was allowed to work remotely so his son, who had a health issue, could live near a specialist hospital.\n\nThe survival of remote work isn't just about individual exceptions. While large employers have made headlines with return-to-office mandates, many smaller businesses and startups have quietly continued to offer flexibility.\n\nA report published last year by Flex Index, a platform that tracks flexible work policies, found that as of the third quarter of 2025, businesses with fewer than 500 employees were much more likely to offer flexible arrangements than Fortune 100 companies. And according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about half of US private-sector workers are employed at companies with fewer than 500 employees.\n\nLeslie Snipes is among the workers who have benefited from the flexibility of working at a small business. Snipes, a director of marketing at a Los Angeles-based creative agency with around 15 employees, said her 60- to 90-minute commute through LA traffic quickly took a toll during her first few months on the job. After speaking with her manager, she received formal approval to work almost exclusively remotely. She said she typically goes into the office once or twice a month to \"show face\" and connect with colleagues.\n\n\"I feel less stressed, since I'm not spending hours sitting in traffic,\" said Snipes, who's in her 30s. \"It's a setup I wouldn't have unless I asked.\"\n\nIn addition to the explanations mentioned above, lower office attendance may also reflect limited desk availability at some offices.\n\nSome employees, however, have simply ignored RTO policies without their managers' approval — a move made easier, in some cases, by geographically distributed teams. Others have turned to \"coffee badging,\" the practice of swiping into the office, grabbing a coffee, and leaving shortly afterward to meet attendance requirements.\n\nIf a weaker job market persists and companies increasingly use attendance-tracking tools, more workers may be compelled to return to the office. On the flipside, a rebound in the labor market could empower workers to push for greater flexibility.\n\nAmid this uncertainty, Bloom said he's confident in the long-term outlook of remote work.\n\n\"Work from home is here to stay,\" he said. \"But it's mostly hybrid, and it seems it's mostly off-record.\"\n\nJuliana Kaplan contributed to this story.",

Few of his colleagues are willing to go there yet.\n\n\"In terms of the actual policy prescription, it's something that I haven't made a determination yet on,\" Democratic Rep.

Mark Pocan of Wisconsin told Business Insider. \"He's pointing out the right problems.\"\n\nRepublicans have been generally dismissive of Sanders's idea. Even Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a major critic of the AI industry, signaled he wouldn't go as far.\n\n\"If these AI companies want to build these data centers and local folks want to give them permits for it, I mean, that's up to local voters,\" Hawley told Business Insider.\n\nA handful of Sanders's progressive allies are backing him up. Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota told Business Insider that a moratorium \"would be a good idea,\" while Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan issued a full-throated endorsement in a post on X.\n\n\"I fully support the call for a national AI data center moratorium,\" Tlaib wrote.\n\nAnd while few Democrats have fully endorsed the idea, it's spurring a conversation within the party about the impact of data centers and AI.\n\n\"I don't want a moratorium on data centers but Bernie is right that we are sleepwalking past risks which alarm even the optimists,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii wrote on X last month.\n\n\"What we do know is that these AI data centers are just uncontrollably jacking up people's energy costs,\" Ocasio-Cortez told Business Insider. \"There are a lot of problems that arise from these data centers, and I think that they certainly should not be getting the blank check from Congress.\"\n\n\"Bernie makes clear that the debate over AI is not about states rights or affordability,\" White House Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks wrote on X in December. \"He would block new data centers even if states want them & they generate their own power. It's about stopping progress completely so China wins the AI race.\"\n\nYet even the administration has come to recognize that data centers are engendering local resistance, in large part due to rising electricity costs.\n\nLast week, President Donald Trump declared that he wanted Big Tech firms to \"pay their own way\" on data centers, with AI companies footing more of the bill for the electricity their facilities consume.\n\n\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nAnd on Friday, the administration and a group of governors called on a major power grid operator to hold a new emergency power auction amid rising costs driven by AI data centers.",

    "description": "Rural hospitals are disappearing across America, with hundreds more under financial distress. It's leaving patients without care options.",
    "fullText": "Emergency rooms, maternity wards, and intensive care units are vanishing across rural America.\n\nThe phenomenon is leaving millions of people without access to medical services. Some now have to travel long distances for their annual checkup, while others worry paramedics won't arrive in time if they need help. Hospitals are major employers, and closures can leave hundreds of people without a job.\n\nThere are a few reasons why this is happening, and has been for decades. Smaller patient populations in rural areas make it difficult for hospitals to cover their operating costs, aging equipment and facilities can become too expensive to fix, and a change in ownership can tip an already-struggling hospital into the red.\n\nThis longstanding problem is also likely to get much worse — and quickly. Medicaid changes in President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act will limit key sources of federal funding to these hospitals, risking future closures. And the administration's $50 billion investment in rural health initiatives might not be enough to offset the harm.\n\nHere's what to know about closures in your area.\n\nSince 2005, 110 of the US' rural hospitals have closed permanently, 24 of which have shut their doors in the last five years. Researchers at The University of North Carolina found that the majority of these hospitals are in especially small and isolated locations, leaving residents with few options to see a doctor for preventive or urgent care. And many of these closure locations are near one another, creating healthcare deserts.\n\nNearly 800 more rural hospitals are currently at risk closure due to financial distress, the Center for Healthcare Equity and Reform estimates.\n\nSome struggling hospitals don't shut down completely. Eighty five rural hospitals have downsized since 2005, stopping all inpatient care while still offering some outpatient services. A formerly complete hospital, for example, might be repurposed into an urgent care, nursing home, or rehab facility.\n\nThis strategy saves money, but can come at the expense of patients. Over 500 hospitals closed their labor and delivery departments in the last decade, more than half of which were in rural areas.\n\nScaled-down hospitals are occasionally repurposed into rural emergency centers, which are designed to handle immediate trauma cases. These hospitals are stand-alone ERs and don't exceed an average patient stay of 24 hours.\n\nSince CMS began tracking it in January 2023, 42 rural hospitals have been converted into these emergency centers.\n\nAnd, while rural America is hardest hit by funding challenges, urban areas aren't immune. A recent report from the Government Accountability Office found that more urban hospitals closed than opened between 2019 to 2023, with many reporting financial distress and outdated equipment in the years before closure.\n\nBusiness Insider is diving into the business of hospitals and Americans' access to healthcare.

    "description": "Akaash Vishal Hazarika, a senior software engineer, explains how AI integration and prompt engineering are changing hiring in Big Tech software roles.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Akaash Vishal Hazarika, a 29-year-old senior software engineer based in Seattle. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been a Big Tech employee for the past eight years, working at Google, Amazon, Splunk, and now Salesforce. I've had a front-row seat to witness the changes in the tech landscape.\n\nI've learned which skill sets software engineers need to land a job offer in the AI era. Tech companies agree that AI makes engineers more productive, so engineers are expected to use it to build things more quickly and reliably.\n\nI personally make heavy use of AI to help me with boilerplate stuff so that I can concentrate on the hard stuff, like system design and complex business logic.\n\nWhen I was interviewing for software engineering jobs in 2020, LeetCode and system design were the de facto standards for cracking a job interview. Job seekers who had an advanced understanding of data structures and algorithms would come out on top.\n\nToday, this is just the baseline expectation. AI is now widely used for coding, review, and design, so tech companies, especially startups, expect more from candidates.\n\nSome skills remain the same: Software engineers still need a problem-solving mindset and should know how to scale systems and leverage cloud services. New hires must now also understand prompt engineering — how to leverage AI to code a solution more efficiently.\n\nYou need to be able to use AI for error handling and bug fixing. AI systems integration is another important new skill that involves incorporating AI into existing workflows, scaling AI systems, and determining when to use traditional versus AI solutions for business decisions.\n\nYou're still expected to have fundamental knowledge of core system design, data structures, and algorithms. You can still expect interviewers to test your problem-solving approaches, and if you know how to make the correct tradeoffs in time and space. Interviewers still care about debugging skills, since AI makes a lot of fundamental logic errors.\n\nYou also need to be prepared for some new things. I've seen firsthand that working with AI assistants in live screen-sharing mode is now allowed in some interviews. Interviewers are looking to see if you can help them achieve their business outcomes by combining software engineering skills with AI prompting.\n\nIn an interview I had with a Silicon Valley startup in 2024, I expected the hiring team to give traditional coding challenges. I was taken aback when I was given a huge code file and asked to debug a buggy behavior, and the interviewers explicitly said I could use AI assistance.\n\nI ignored the invitation to use AI, thinking I was supposed to do it myself, and ended up spending a lot of time on the problem to no avail. I failed that interview. That was an eye-opener for me about AI's new role in this field.\n\nYou may also be asked system design questions about where AI should be integrated into the current business workflow, or to discuss the trade-offs of using AI and traditional approaches in various problem contexts.\n\nDuring my own system design interviews, I noticed companies starting to ask questions about how to integrate AI to enhance existing systems and support a particular model lifecycle in terms of infrastructure. What I've seen is that companies give access to a small codebase and expect you to deliver a small feature in about one hour, which is impossible without AI. With AI, you can roll it out easily.\n\nI've also been asked behavioral questions, like \"How do you plan to evaluate the use of AI in order to make the workflow better?\" and \"How do you plan to balance automation and manual oversight?\"\n\nFor new graduates, here's how to show hiring teams that you're equipped for the emerging needs of the software engineering role.\n\nStart by contributing to open-source projects on AI or any other GitHub project. This demonstrates that you can navigate a production codebase and work on it independently to build a new feature or fix a bug. For solo repositories, include a README that explains the rationale for your decision.\n\nIncorporate the use of AI in traditional repositories to demonstrate hands-on experience with AI integration. Don't just deploy and run it locally — try to deploy it to the cloud. Many cloud providers provide free student credits.\n\nFocus on prompting AI to drive intended outcomes more effectively by providing structured input and output. Skills like AWS or GCP cloud certifications demonstrate your ability to be a keen learner.\n\nLearn different problem-solving patterns and practice these skills regularly. Muscle memory and pattern recognition go a long way.\n\nFor experienced software engineers, your biggest asset is your deep engineering experience — here are three tips that will help you in 2026 and beyond.\n\nPairing years of engineering expertise with impressive AI skills will get the attention of hiring managers. Consider boning up on these complementary skills:\n\nSenior software engineers don't just build; they also need to strategize and innovate. Try to understand the trade-offs of relying on a third-party API versus using an open-source one and fine-tuning it for your business purposes. Questions on cost, reliability, and maintainability should always be top of mind as you develop an AI product mindset.\n\nIdentify workflows that have a great deal of manual involvement in your current job, and use AI to see if you can improve them. You can leverage AI to help you brainstorm on how to make it more efficient.\n\nBoth veteran and newbie engineers should stay curious: find out the cool technologies and AI agents available in today's market, but don't abandon fundamental engineering approaches. The hybrid understanding of these technologies is what makes you valuable.\n\nIf I were interviewing, I'd position myself as a 'hybrid engineer.' Don't just be a pure coder or just a prompt engineer. Be the bridge.",

    "description": "Eryn Bostwick said that her high student-loan payments have prevented her from moving forward with IVF treatment.",
    "fullText": "College was always the goal for Eryn Bostwick.\n\nAs a first-generation college student, Bostwick, 37, said her parents wanted to ensure she had the opportunities they didn't have, and they believed that earning a college degree would provide her with financial stability.\n\nBostwick's parents weren't wrong — data show that a four-year college degree leads to higher earnings than a high school diploma. However, to accomplish that goal, Bostwick had to take out student loans and Pell grants. She said she wasn't fully aware of the long-term ramifications of the debt.\n\nShe now has just over $55,000 in student loan debt, which she accrued while pursuing a bachelor's, master's, and Ph.D. at public universities with the goal of becoming a college professor. As a result, she's put off major life decisions, like adding to her family.\n\n\"I've always been very careful about when I would feel comfortable bringing a child into this world,\" Bostwick told Business Insider.\n\nIn vitro fertilization, or IVF, was the only way Bostwick could have a child due to existing medical conditions. While Bostwick and her husband were able to afford the initial rounds of treatments, Bostwick left her full-time job in Texas to move back to Ohio to be closer to family, and she was unable to find a job that paid enough to cover IVF, student-loan payments, and her other expenses.\n\nShe now works as a part-time teacher at two different colleges, with an income in the low five figures.\n\n\"Could we go through IVF? Sure, but then we wouldn't be able to afford actually having a child,\" Bostwick said. \"It just felt like there's too much hanging over our heads.\"\n\nMany student-loan borrowers have told Business Insider that they've had to put off major life decisions, like having children, retiring, or purchasing a home, due to their high debt loads. The year ahead could bring even more financial strain to borrowers — President Donald Trump's Education Department will begin implementing a repayment overhaul in July, which includes new repayment plans with higher monthly payments.\n\nThe uncertainty of what's to come in the student-loan industry has borrowers like Bostwick wary of making major life decisions that could become significant financial burdens.\n\n\"It feels like any power was taken from me, all because of a decision I made when I was 18 years old that I didn't completely comprehend, that my parents didn't completely comprehend, that I felt was necessary in order to create this better life for myself,\" Bostwick said. \"And now it's really just become a noose around my neck.\"\n\nBostwick said she has 71 qualifying payments toward the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years, or 120 qualifying payments.\n\nHowever, she is also enrolled in the SAVE plan, created by former President Joe Biden and intended to provide borrowers with cheaper monthly payments and a shorter timeline to debt relief. Borrowers on the plan have been in forbearance since July 2024 due to litigation, meaning that PSLF borrowers have not been receiving credit toward forgiveness during that period.\n\nAdditionally, Trump's administration announced a proposed settlement to eliminate the plan. If a court approves the settlement, SAVE borrowers would have a limited time to enroll in a new income-driven repayment plan with higher payments.\n\n\"The law is clear: if you take out a loan, you must pay it back,\" Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement alongside the announcement of the proposed settlement.\n\nIt's not that simple, Bostwick said. Many of the students she teaches are first-generation, like herself, and they pursued higher education because they were told it's the best way to achieve upward mobility and financial stability. Given her experience with student debt, Bostwick said she \"makes it her mission\" to ensure her students are aware of the implications of taking out loans, and that a degree isn't always necessary to pursue certain career paths.\n\n\"I've never once heard somebody say they don't want to be able to take out loans and never pay them back,\" Bostwick said. \"They want to be able to pay their loans back, but the current system makes it nearly impossible.\"\n\nTrump's Department of Education said it's working to improve the system. It just concluded negotiations on proposals aimed at preventing borrowers from taking out unaffordable debt, and it has previously said that its changes to repayment are aimed at reducing complexity in the student-loan industry.\n\nBostwick said she isn't getting her hopes up.\n\n\"I just feel like I've constantly been trying to keep my head above the water, and it's never really been good enough,\" she said. \"It's unbelievably frustrating.\"\n\nHave a story to share?

    "fullText": "Cameron Brink is on a mission to get jacked.\n\nSure, she's is already a pro athlete for the WNBA. But the Los Angeles Sparks forward has become \"kind of a snob\" about building muscle.\n\n\"I'm stronger than I've ever been, and that's because I've tried to be genuinely intentional about what I'm putting in my body and my routine,\" she told me for Business Insider.\n\nBrink recently gushed over Zoom with me about her favorite strength training exercises (Bulgarian split squats) and equipment (a Keiser leg extension machine at her trainer's house), laughing a little at herself. It's a level of gym nerdiness that would have been unheard of for her a few years ago.\n\nBut \"that's what ACL recovery does to you,\" Brink said. Last season marked her return from a 2024 injury, and since then, she's been all about lifting weights.\n\nFor maximum muscle-building, Brink has also doubled down on optimizing protein, partnering with nutrition app MyFitnessPal, which she uses to stay on track.\n\n\"Something I never realized is how much protein I actually need,\" she said.\n\nAt a listed height of 6' 4\" (Brink said she's actually an inch taller), getting enough fuel can feel like a full-time job.\n\n\"I'm doing things that the average person doesn't do. So that's where I really needed to start tracking my protein and my macros. And it really made a huge difference,\" Brink said.\n\nThe rising star of women's basketball gave me the rundown on her low-stress approach to food tracking, and what's on the menu for a typical day in her life.\n\nBrink's game plan for good nutrition starts the night before a busy day.\n\nIn the evenings, she preps the next day's breakfast: overnight oats or chia pudding, mixed with protein powder, berries, and honey.\n\nThe combo is full of carbohydrates for energy, including quick-digesting carbs for a short-term boost, along with slower-digesting complex carbs so Brink can stay full and focused on training. Her breakfast also packs in plenty of protein for muscle growth and fiber for gut health.\n\nNext up is coffee — Brink saves it for after the first meal of the day, to help provide more stable energy and prevent a crash later.\n\n\"I've shifted to having my caffeine after I have my breakfast, which I feel like has made a huge difference,\" she said.\n\nBrink also has a daily supplement regimen that includes iron, vitamin D, and muscle-building creatine.\n\nThen comes a chef-prepared lunch at the Sparks' training facility, where Brink often opts for two pieces of salmon with a side of Japanese sweet potatoes and asparagus. Lunch is followed by a nap.\n\nThroughout the day, Brink said she relies on snacks like bananas, dates with almond butter, or almonds.\n\nBefore a game, her go-to fuel source is classic peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.\n\n\"I love peanut butter and jelly. That's what really fuels me through the game is just having some of the protein from the peanut butter, but a lot of carbs,\" she said.\n\nOn nights when she's not playing, Brink makes dinner with her fiancé, former Stanford rower Ben Felter, who handles the protein while she preps the sides like pasta salad or baked potatoes.\n\nBrink also treats herself, especially on the weekends, with food from Dave's Hot Chicken or In-N-Out Burger.\n\nShe said it's important to keep a flexible approach to eating so she doesn't feel guilty or obsess over what's on her plate.\n\n\"I'm not going to beat myself up like, 'Oh, I should have had 30 more grams of protein or something.' It's just something I can build on for the next day,\" Brink said.",

    "description": "Oculus founder Palmer Luckey said Meta's VR cuts targeted subsidized game studios that were crowding out developers and distorting the industry.",
    "fullText": "Meta's decision to cut more than a thousand jobs in Reality Labs and wind down parts of its metaverse strategy has reignited fears that the company is quietly backing away from virtual reality.\n\nOculus founder Palmer Luckey says that interpretation is wrong — and misses a deeper problem the cuts may actually solve.\n\nIn a series of posts on X on Monday, Luckey said that Meta's Reality Labs layoffs, which The New York Times reported were roughly 10% to 15% of the division's 15,000 employees, do not signal retreat.\n\nMeta still employs the largest VR workforce in the world, he said, dwarfing competitors \"by about an order of magnitude.\"\n\nFrom a numbers perspective, Luckey framed the layoffs as \"six months of normal churn concentrated into 60 days,\" not an existential blow.\n\nThe more consequential shift, he said, lies in where the cuts landed.\n\nAccording to Luckey, most of the eliminated roles were tied to first-party content — Meta-owned studios building internally developed VR games.\n\nThose teams, he said, had become a growing problem for the broader VR ecosystem.\n\n\"Meta heavily subsidizing their own (with money, marketing, placement, etc) at the expense of core technical progress and platform stability doesn't make sense,\" Luckey wrote. \"Crowding out the rest of the entire ecosystem, even less so.\"\n\nLuckey said third-party developers — even efficient, well-run studios — struggled to compete against Meta-owned teams backed by budgets that far exceeded what the market could realistically return.\n\nThe irony, he added, was that strong reviews and polished execution only worsened the imbalance by pulling attention and sales away from independent creators.\n\n\"People will point out that these teams did an awesome job and got awesome reviews from critics and customers alike — yes, and fucked up though it is, that makes the problem even worse!\" he wrote.\n\nIn a capital-constrained environment, Luckey said, Meta's resources are better spent on core technology and platform stability than on competing directly with developers it needs to keep VR viable.\n\nHe also framed the move as a return to Oculus's original philosophy. Internally, he said, the company aimed \"to NOT be Nintendo\" — avoiding a closed, first-party-dominated model in favor of building an ecosystem that others could profit from.\n\nLuckey acknowledged the human cost of layoffs and said he felt \"really bad for the people impacted.\"\n\nStill, he said that scaling back first-party content is ultimately \"a good thing for the long-term health of the industry,\" even if it's uncomfortable in the short term.",

    "title": "An Alaskan mine that's been in political limbo for years might be the key to satisfying America's huge appetite for copper",
    "description": "S&P Global said in a recent analysis that copper supply would fall short of demand for the next 15 years, barring significant increases in production.",
    "fullText": "Copper prices are soaring, and supply is expected to badly lag demand in the coming decade, but a small Alaska mine that's been in political limbo for years might hold the key to meeting the voracious appetite for the metal.\n\nBristol Bay is located in the southwest corner of Alaska, in the easternmost arm of the Bering Sea. The area boasts one of the nation's richest sockeye salmon runs. It's also home to a stalled project to mine a resource that's highly important to the AI infrastructure boom.\n\nLocals know all about the Pebble Mine project. The site was touted as having the potential to bring an economic windfall to the remote area, but was stalled by an EPA ruling. The wrangling over the project has gone on for over a decade and has spanned three presidential administrations—but with a copper shortage looming, the mining project has been thrust back into the spotlight.\n\nCopper prices are up sharply, breaking above $12,000 a ton for the first time in the last week and rising more than 40% in 12 months. The AI buildout is one factor that's sent demand soaring. However, a study by S&P Global this month said that supply will fall massively short between now and 2040, barring a sizable increase in production.\n\nThe firm predicts that copper production will peak in 2030, leaving the world roughly 10 million metric tons short by 2040.\n\nThe Pebble Mine project sits on vast copper and gold reserves. However, its operations have been blocked since 2014 under an Environmental Protection Agency provision that has remained in place across the Obama, Biden, and Trump administrations.\n\n\"Pebble is a world-class deposit,\" Deantha Skibinski, who serves as executive director of the Alaska Miners Association, told Business Insider. \"The copper in the ground at the pebble project is immense.\"\n\nShe added that there are few copper producers in the US with the type of reserves that Pebble Mine is sitting on. The project's owner says the site is the world's largest undeveloped store of both copper and gold. It also has large deposits of molybdenum and silver, two metals that also play a role in the AI buildout.\n\nSkibinski recalled the EPA's 2014 decision to block the mine during its exploratory phase after it failed a watershed assessment.\n\n\"What they did, which we contend is not legal, is that they issued the 404(c) veto preemptively, meaning before the company went into permitting,\" she said. \"And that is unprecedented.\"\n\nPebble Limited responded with a lawsuit, kicking off a long, complicated legal saga. More than a decade later, the mine is still not in operation.\n\nNow, as the US under Trump scrambles to secure domestic supplies of critical materials, Skibinski thinks the Pebble Mine project should get another look by the administration.\n\n\"You would think that the government should fully examine, transparently and honestly, how to get more mines that produce copper and other minerals online,\" she said. \"But when you talk about what it actually takes, there are many that say they're not interested in going that route.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump expressed support for other Alaska mining endeavors during his first term, including the Pebble Mine and a project that would open up the state's mineral-rich Ambler Mining District. But the New York Times reported in 2020 that Donald Trump Jr. opposed the mine's construction, citing the potential environmental impacts.\n\nA spokesperson for Trump Jr. did not return a request for comment. The White House did not reply to a request for comment about the administration's current stance on the Pebble Mine project.\n\n\"It is crucial for the President and all the federal agencies that may be holding up Pebble to understand that copper is vital for meeting our needs of a modern society that relies on it,\" said Lisa Reimers, an area native and the CEO of construction and logistics company Iliamna Development. \"Pebble Mine is an important project for the United States so we are not to be dependent on foreign companies for copper.\"",

    "title": "Some flight attendants at ultra-low-cost carriers make more than United crew. Here's how much they earn.",
    "description": "United's roughly 28,000 flight attendants haven't seen a raise since 2020. Allegiant's new contract has now outpaced United at almost every level.",
    "fullText": "Ultra-low-cost carriers often lure passengers with rock-bottom fares, in part by paying flight attendants less than those at legacy carriers.\n\nBut pay for entry-level flight attendants at these airlines has ticked up to compete with the Big 3 airlines, American, Delta, and United, and in one case, surpassed it due to the nearly six-year United negotiations.\n\nThe moment may not last. United's flight attendants are widely expected to secure significant raises once a new contract is finalized — which would once again widen the pay gap between legacy and ULCCs that has been the norm.\n\nBased on ultra-low-cost carrier labor contracts reviewed by Business Insider, Allegiant flight attendants start at about $30 an hour and reach a top base pay of roughly $66 after 12 years of service. That will increase to $31 and $68 when the contractual annual raise hits in April.\n\nCompetitors Spirit and Frontier — each with around 4,000 cabin crew — start at roughly $22 and $25 per hour, respectively, and both top out at about $60 per hour. But Frontier's maximum rate is unusually slow to kick in, taking 19 years to reach, compared to the more typical 13 years.\n\nFrontier's 13-year base pay is about $50 an hour. Glassdoor puts the median annual pay among US flight attendants at about $68,000.\n\nThese base rates don't account for taxes, per diem, or other forms of compensation, such as overtime, holiday, and night-flying premiums.\n\nPer diem is a small hourly stipend paid for time spent away from a crew member's home base while on trips and typically runs about $2 to $3 an hour, depending on the airline. Airlines also offer flight attendants free personal flights as part of their employment benefits.\n\nStill, those at United earn more than Spirit and Frontier, paying first-years about $28 and veteran crew about $67, but those base rates are outpaced by Allegiant.\n\nAllegiant and its roughly 1,700 flight attendants ratified a new five-year contract in April 2024, securing an average wage increase of 41% over the life of the deal. As a result, most Allegiant crew earn a higher base rate than their United counterparts.\n\nThe gap varies — roughly $1 to $8 an hour, depending on seniority — but can add up to several thousand dollars in extra annual income. United's roughly 28,000 flight attendants, by contrast, haven't seen a raise since 2020.\n\nContract negotiations have stretched into 2026 after United union members rejected a tentative agreement in July 2025 that would have boosted pay by 44% over the life of the proposed five-year contract, and offered boarding pay.\n\nStill, United crew members can boost their pay significantly by picking up extra hours and working premium international trips.\n\nAllegiant told Business Insider that its merger with Sun Country wouldn't change its flight attendant contract until the deal is done. After that, it will continue talks with the National Mediation Board and union leadership \"about the process that makes the most sense for both our employees and the company.\"\n\nSpirit and Frontier's contracts are up for renegotiation, meaning crew members are earning outdated pay during the process. Spirit's Chapter 11 bankruptcy forced flight attendants to temporarily accept pay cuts, but their base pay remains the same.\n\nHere are the lowest and highest base wages at the three ULCCs, per their contracts. The figures reflect the minimum hourly guarantee for lineholders, who are flight attendants with fixed monthly schedules.\n\nReserve crew, who are on standby to cover flights at a moment's notice, usually have a higher guarantee, so the lineholder base represents the minimum pay a flight attendant can typically expect hourly and yearly. All annual estimates are before tax or extra earnings.\n\nOverall, crew often spend more time on duty than they are paid for, as their regular hourly wage generally applies only to time the plane is in motion — not to layovers, deplaning, or delays while the plane is at the gate.\n\nAllegiant's minimum guarantee is 75 hours a month for reserves and lineholders, in most cases. Come April, when the contractual raise kicks in, Allegiant's entire base pay scale will be higher than United's.\n\nAllegiant's rates will max out at roughly $33 and $72 by April 2028, or about $30,000 and $65,000 a year. United's base pay, by contrast, ranges from about $24,600 to roughly $57,000.\n\nWhile reserve crew members have a pay guarantee of 75 hours a month, Frontier lineholders don't have a minimum. But lines generally fall between 60 and 120 hours, with 60 hours serving as the expected low end. Frontier's pay scale goes up to year 19.\n\nSpirit's reserve crew and lineholder minimum is 72 hours. Its flight attendants recently agreed to temporarily reduce their pay amid the airline's second bankruptcy.\n\nAn amended contract shows that, as of January 1, crew now earn less overtime and holiday pay and face a cap on per diem, among other cuts, saving Spirit $15 million annually. The airline also furloughed about 1,800 cabin crew in December.\n\nA United spokesperson previously told Business Insider that many of the airline's flight attendants earn more than $100,000 a year because they have the flexibility to work extra hours and the seniority to secure higher-paying trips, particularly international ones.\n\nFor example, Allegiant is a fully domestic airline that does not operate long-haul routes, which at United typically pay about $2 more per hour and generate slightly higher per diem.\n\nAllegiant also largely relies on an out-and-back schedule, with flight attendants usually returning to their home base the same day — a core part of its ultra-low-cost strategy to cut hotel and per diem expenses. United and Spirit's scheduling relies on more frequent overnights.\n\nFrontier recently shifted to a model similar to Allegiant, with roughly 90% of its planes and crews returning to base each night. While this appeals to flight attendants who value being home, it has been controversial because it reduces earnings opportunities.\n\nAirlines also differ in minimum monthly guarantees. United reserve crew members receive 78 hours, compared with 75 at Allegiant, though Allegiant lineholders get four more guaranteed hours than United lineholders.\n\nUnited crews also receive a nice bonus every year through profit sharing. It was 5.3% of eligible earnings in 2024, and 9% in 2025 — a benefit largely absent at ULCCs.",

It was restocked by Lego but is now sold out again.\n\nWith an 18+ age rating, the Lego collection is aimed at adults, with Pokémon references that go back to the franchise's first generation.\n\nJay Ong, the author of Jay's Brick Blog, a Lego news hub recognized by the company's ambassador network, told Business Insider that this collection hits the sweet spot for adults who have a \"voracious appetite for toys and experiences that feed into their childhood nostalgia.\"\n\nIt's \"the perfect marriage of two beloved brands at the peak of their respective popularities. Fans have been waiting decades for official Lego Pokémon sets,\" he said.\n\nThe 6,838-piece Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise set began appearing on eBay on Monday last week. The most expensive set that has sold since then cost $1,289.99. Others have resold for between $690 and $1,150, the listings show.\n\nOne item that seemed to be a popular target for resellers was the free gift with purchase, or GWP, that came with the Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise set: the Kanto Region Badge Collection.\n\nThe badge collection consists of a 312-piece video game collectible set described on the Lego website as \"nostalgic.\" Scalpers are reselling this for north of $200.\n\n\"Historically, GWP sets have a very limited production run, so when they're sold out, Lego will usually not make any more,\" Tiago Catarino, a former Lego model designer and content creator with over 570,000 subscribers on YouTube, told Business Insider.\n\n\"This is the perfect type of product for resellers and people trying to make some of their money back on their purchases.\"\n\nLego said in a press release that the badge collection will be available as a GWP with the Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise set from February 27 to March 3, until stocks last.\n\nA spokesperson for Lego declined to comment on the allocation of the promotion.\n\nThe resale market may also appeal to fans who do not want to — or cannot afford to — buy the $650 set to access the badge collection.\n\n\"They may prefer just buying it outright, which creates further demand for these GWPs,\" Lego blogger Ong said.\n\nJesus Rosado, a 32-year-old Pokémon collector, listed the Venusaur, Charizard, and Blastoise set, with the badge collection and a Pokémon Center — which can only be purchased with Lego loyalty points — for $1,499.00 on eBay.\n\nLego's loyalty program enables members to earn points by purchasing sets on the official website and in participating stores, which can then be exchanged for discounts and rewards.\n\nDespite originally buying the set for himself, after seeing how much the GWP was selling for on eBay, Rosado decided to wait until the set sold out before listing his preorder.\n\nReselling, especially of recent releases, is frowned upon in the Lego community. One eBay user called Rosado a \"pathetic scalper\" via an eBay message, which was shared with Business Insider.\n\n\"Yes, I am a scalper in that sense of the word, where I'm buying the product to resell. But I'm not a large entity — I'm just an individual,\" Rosado said.\n\n\"It's no different than someone going out and mowing lawns to earn a couple extra dollars on the weekend or someone who does, you know, nail tech services on the side. So it's not my main bread and butter. It is just a side gig,\" he said.\n\nLego has an established reselling scene, with numerous platforms and physical stores dedicated to buying and selling Lego.\n\nDiscontinued and rare products can fetch hundreds or even thousands of dollars in the secondary market.\n\n\"As Lego achieves more mainstream popularity, this has attracted more resellers, speculators, and investors looking to exploit imbalances between supply and demand,\" said Ong, Jay's Brick Blog author.\n\nHowever, while Lego is used by some people as an alternative investment, it is not on the same scale and intensity as Pokémon cards.\n\nInfluencer and WWE wrestler Logan Paul said he planned to auction his rare Pokémon card — which he bought for $5.3 million — early this year.\n\n\"From my understanding, if the Lego community is big on the scalper/reselling side of things, the Pokémon community matches that by tenfold,\" said Catarino, Lego content creator.",

    "title": "The Supreme Court is about to weigh in on the Fed's independence in a case that goes beyond Jerome Powell",
    "description": "The Fed's independence is being tested. Here's what SCOTUS justices could say on Wednesday about Trump's efforts to fire Fed board member Lisa Cook.",
    "fullText": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday is scheduled to hear arguments over President Donald Trump's attempts to fire a sitting Federal Reserve board member.\n\nLisa Cook, whom Trump tried to remove in August, has asked the high court to ensure she can keep her job. She's argued that the \"cause\" Trump cited, which involves allegations of mortgage irregularities, is a pretext. The efforts to fire her are based on politics, not economic data or job performance, her lawyers say.\n\nThe case has broad implications for the central bank's independence at a critical moment. Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell accused Trump's Justice Department of an unprecedented attempt to pressure him with what he described as a sham criminal probe.\n\nAs Powell continues to battle what he has described as improper political interference, the Cook case tests a separate but related legal question: Can the president of the United States unseat a sitting Fed governor for any reason?\n\nJosh Chafetz, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown Law School, predicted the criminal investigation into Powell could make the Supreme Court justices more inclined to \"put the brakes\" on Trump's efforts to pressure the Fed.\n\n\"John Roberts doesn't want to throw the global economy into turmoil,\" Chafetz said, referring to the chief justice.\n\nOver the past year, the Supreme Court has greenlit Trump's firing of other independent agency leaders. At the same time, the majority of justices have said they would treat the Federal Reserve with special deference.\n\nIn Wednesday's oral arguments, we'll learn more about just how special the Fed really is.\n\nThe Federal Reserve — like the Federal Trade Commission and National Labor Relations Board — was created by Congress as an independent agency, structured to insulate its members from political winds. Presidents appoint board members for staggered 14-year terms. Cook, a Biden appointee, has until 2038 before her term expires.\n\nOver the years, the Supreme Court has chipped away at the independence of similarly constructed agencies.\n\nIn 2020, it ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent agency with a single director, could have its leader fired by the president \"at will\" — meaning for any reason whatsoever — rather than \"for cause.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has suggested it may soon allow \"at will\" firings of leaders of independent agencies led by multi-member boards, too. In December, it heard oral arguments for a lawsuit brought by Rebecca Slaughter, who Trump fired from the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nTrump's letter firing Slaughter didn't identify any cause, even though the Supreme Court has previously said presidents need to meet that standard to remove FTC commissioners. And unlike Cook, the Supreme Court has allowed Slaughter to be removed from her post while additional legal proceedings play out.\n\nThe Supreme Court hasn't yet issued a final ruling in Slaughter's case. But during oral arguments in December, several Republican-appointed justices indicated they could deal a death blow to a 90-year-old case that recognized limits to the president's ability to fire members of independent agencies. The landmark unanimous ruling said agencies like the FTC were \"quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative,\" a structure intended to safeguard them from \"political domination.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts referred to the 1935 opinion, known as Humphrey's Executor, as \"a dried husk.\" Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett both asked Slaughter's lawyer if he could cite different Supreme Court precedents that would allow her to keep her job.\n\nDuring the past year's legal battles between the Trump administration and independent agency leaders, the justices have gone out of their way to single out the independence of the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn May, a majority of justices allowed Trump to remove members from two independent agencies — the Merit Systems Protection Board and National Labor Relations Board — but said the Federal Reserve's \"for cause removal protections\" would need to be considered with its \"distinct historical tradition\" in mind.\n\n\"The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States,\" the justices wrote in an unsigned opinion.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh took pains during oral arguments in the Slaughter case to indicate that he was inclined to give the Federal Reserve special treatment.\n\nWhile questioning Solicitor General John Sauer, Kavanaugh asked about drawing \"a principled, sensible line\" that would distinguish the Federal Reserve from other agencies.\n\n\"The other side says that your position would undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve and they have concerns about that, and I share those concerns,\" Kavanaugh told Sauer.\n\nAlthough most Americans don't interact with the Fed directly, its policies affect their everyday lives. By controlling the direction of interest rates, the central bank determines the cost of borrowing and returns on savings. The Fed and its independence are the cornerstones of the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency.\n\nTo hear Cook's lawyers and prominent economists tell it, the potential damage is extraordinarily high. If Trump can fire her, then the door is open for future presidents to steamroll the Fed and cause economic chaos, they say.\n\n\"We can think about the Cook removal as seeking a roadmap from the court for how to potentially remove other governors, including Jerome Powell,\" said Lev Menand, a professor of administrative law and financial institutions at Columbia Law School.\n\nIn his attempt to fire Cook, Trump cited a criminal referral from Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who said Cook lied on mortgage forms.\n\nThat apparent deceitfulness, according to Trump, made Cook ill-suited for her role in setting interest rates.\n\nThere is no public indication that, in the months since Pulte's letter, the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into Cook's mortgage paperwork.\n\nThe Trump administration has maintained that the president can fire a Federal Reserve board member for any reason and that courts don't have the power to second-guess any \"for cause\" justifications.\n\nCook's attorneys argue that such freedom defeats the entire purpose of \"for cause\" limitations, turning Fed board members into \"at will\" government employees. They also say that \"for cause\" justifications can only involve conduct during Cook's service — not years-old mortgage paperwork.\n\n​​With the Powell investigation \"hovering\" over the Cook case, the justices may be more wary of giving Trump the flexibility he wants to get rid of Cook, Chafetz said.\n\n\"If the president gets to define anything as 'cause,' and that's completely unreviewable, then that is serving at the pleasure of the president,\" Chafetz said.",

    "description": "Luxury watch trends for 2026 could include Cartier rising in popularity among buyers and smaller dial sizes gaining ground.",
    "fullText": "First-time watch buyers are driving new buying patterns that are shaping what's to come in the watch market in 2026.\n\nNew buyers are increasingly viewing watches as both a personal style statement and a long-term purchase worth saving for, industry insiders say.\n\nThe first-time watch buyer is getting younger and smarter about where and when they're purchasing their pieces.\n\nThe secondhand luxury market is benefiting, with the resale market expected to reach as much as $360 billion by 2030, according to an October report from Boston Consulting Group and the pre-owned fashion marketplace Vestiaire Collective.\n\nYounger shoppers are gravitating toward clean lines and recognizable designs, suggesting this year's watch boom may be defined less by flash and more by restraint.\n\n\"If 2025 was the year people started flirting with watches, 2026 is the year they commit — especially younger buyers,\" watch marketplace Swiss Watch Expo CEO Eugene Tutunikov said.\n\nWe asked two pre-owned watch dealers and a stylist what they think will be the hottest watch trends in 2026. Here's what they said:\n\nCartier had a moment with Gen Z watch lovers in 2025, and watch dealers expect it to build on that momentum in 2026. Although Rolex is expected to remain king, Cartier is predicted to be in high demand this year.\n\nPop icon Taylor Swift recently gave the watches her stamp of approval. The singer was spotted wearing a Cartier Santos Demoiselle in her engagement announcement photos in August.\n\n\"Cartier has officially crossed from 'fashion favorite' to 'smart buy.'\" Tutunikov said. \"It's what style-driven clients want, but also what savvy buyers trust to hold value. In 2026, Cartier isn't slowing down — it's setting the pace.\"\n\nThree models have driven the recent interest from Gen Z in particular: the entry-level Tank, the sportier Santos, and the dressy Panthère, Chrono24 previously shared with Business Insider.\n\nSmaller watches, suitable for everyday wear, are becoming more popular. Larger pieces, typically considered those more than 40 millimeters, are out, Altieri said.\n\n\"Case sizes around 36 to 40 millimeters, clean dials, and versatile designs that work every day are resonating more than bold statement pieces,\" he said.\n\nReginald Ferguson, stylist and founder of New York Fashion Geek, said 36 to 40 millimeters will likely be the sweet spot for watch buyers in 2026.\n\nWatches are more than styling pieces these days. Tutunikov told Business Insider that they're sentimental keepsakes that can make memories more tangible. He's seeing more parents gift watches to their kids, for example.\n\n\"We're seeing more families skip the big graduation trip and choose a watch instead,\" Tutunikov said. \"It's emotional, permanent, and tied to a moment in time — you wear that memory every day.\"\n\nWatches are also considered investments, making them a gift that keeps on giving.",

    "description": "Capitalism is alive and well in the private sector, where many employers have higher expectations and care less about loyalty.",
    "fullText": "A few years ago, HR practitioner T. Tara Turk-Haynes hired yoga instructors and meditation gurus to help employees handle burnout at the media company where she worked.\n\nShe's not doing anything like that today.\n\nWellness perks are no longer \"a thing,\" said Turk-Haynes, now an independent HR consultant in Los Angeles. \"Attracting and retaining talent is not a business challenge right now.\"\n\nThe white-collar workplace has gotten a lot less cuddly in the past few years, as the economic bargain between employers and employees has been redefined. Perks have vanished, in-office mandates are on the rise, and layoffs continue even as profits hold up — changes that reflect a system that prioritizes shareholder returns over stakeholder capitalism and corporate loyalty.\n\nWith job openings thinning, wages struggling to keep pace with inflation, and AI looming as a threat to entire occupations, the recalibration is altering how advancement and compensation are determined inside companies — a new reality that some workers view as destabilizing, and others see as a long-overdue reset.\n\n\"When COVID happened, there was a shift in power from employers to employees with the Great Resignation,\" said Jessica Kriegel, chief strategy officer at workplace consulting firm Culture Partners in Sacramento, Calif. \"The pendulum swung really far. Now it's swinging back.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Meta began rolling out a new employee evaluation program that ties career advancement and financial rewards to measurable impact, while Citi CEO Jane Fraser issued a memo saying she expects higher performance this year and to see \"the last vestiges of old, bad habits fall away.\"\n\nIn August, AT&T's John Stankey told managers the company had moved away from a tenure-based \"employment deal\" toward one \"focused on rewarding capability, contribution, and commitment.\"\n\nMeanwhile, some CEOs, particularly those aligned with the Trump administration, have become more outspoken about their political views, suggesting diminished concern about alienating talent. In November, Palantir CEO Alex Karp told analysts on an earnings call that his software company is the first \"to be completely anti-woke.\"\n\nThe shift toward a more explicitly capitalistic workplace is taking hold even as leaders across the political spectrum are championing increased government involvement in private enterprise. The US, for example, has recently taken equity stakes in about a dozen private companies—an unusual expansion of direct federal ownership in the private sector.\n\nNow, even though the economy is relatively healthy, most employers are planning to trim or maintain head count this year, survey data show, while white-collar workers are job-hugging and bracing for more layoffs.\n\n\"There is pressure on CEOs from investors and shareholders to continue to grow,\" said Kriegel. \"And that pressure is getting pushed down onto employees.\"\n\nThe current moment stands apart, though it's not the first time the pendulum has shifted toward employers.\n\nThe dot-com bust in the early 2000s and the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2009 also cooled hiring. Both events, however, coincided with steep stock market declines, whereas the post-pandemic period has been marked by generally strong results on Wall Street.\n\n\"The stock market's doing well, record-setting, and yet companies are squeezing their employees,\" said Peter Cappelli, professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.\n\nThe rise of AI has also posed a new existential threat to workers. Many employers see the potential for the technology to replace human talent through automation, and some have cited AI directly or indirectly as a reason for layoffs.\n\n\"Before asking for more headcount and resources, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI,\" wrote Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke in an April memo to the company's employees.\n\nTo be sure, employers' labor costs — typically their largest expense — are on the rise.\n\nFor one, the average price of employer-sponsored health insurance in the US is expected to increase 6.7% this year, up from 4.5% in 2024, according to consulting firm Mercer.\n\nBusinesses have also incurred a new expense: AI investments, including chatbot licenses and employee training. Research firm IDC forecasts that US-based firms will spend roughly $320 billion on AI hardware, software, and services this year.\n\nThose costs come as corporate leaders are navigating what they describe as a shakier economic environment. Mentions of \"economic uncertainty\" on US public company earnings calls more than doubled in 2025 compared with the prior year, according to market-intelligence platform AlphaSense.\n\nEmployment experts say the uncertainty helps explain why the job market has been stuck in a low-hire, low-fire state.\n\nEven as large companies such as Starbucks, Southwest Airlines, and Disney announced massive layoffs last year, the overall rate of layoffs and discharges stayed below historical norms, Labor Department data show.\n\nThe result is a labor market full of contradictions, said Nicole Bachaud, an economist at ZipRecruiter. \"That's why it feels so weird,\" she said.\n\nThe unemployment rate finished last year at 4.4%, near historic lows.\n\nStill, many professionals lack confidence in the job market as career opportunities in once-reliable sectors, such as technology and the federal government, have thinned.\n\n\"Psychologically, it's damaging,\" said Lars Schmidt, a recruiting executive in the Washington, D.C., area.\n\nIn industries where jobs were plentiful, workers generally knew how long it would take to find a new position if they craved change. Now, \"most people don't have any safe prediction of what that may be,\" Schmidt said.\n\nAnother drag on confidence is the bleak employment outlook. A recent survey of US CEOs by the Yale School of Management shows that nearly two-thirds plan to maintain or reduce head count in 2026.\n\nFurther, average annual pay increases are forecast to remain flat in 2026, despite continued high inflation and after shrinking in recent years, according to Mercer.\n\nThese factors may help explain why workers feel economically insecure. Nearly a third of Americans expect their finances to worsen this year, according to a December survey by Bankrate. That is the highest level of pessimism since 2018, when the personal-finance site began asking consumers about their financial outlook.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, workers are increasingly reluctant to quit. The US quit rate has fallen below pre-pandemic norms, federal data show, even as more employers mandate five days in the office and track workers' hours and AI usage.\n\nAll of this leaves workers with little appetite for pushback, said Jeff LeBlanc, a management lecturer at Bentley University. \"You're not going to see a big revolt,\" he said. \"I don't think people have it in them right now.\"\n\nThough the overall job market forecast is gloomy, there are some bright spots for workers.\n\nDemand is robust for people who can build out AI applications across industries, said Aditya Challapally, who teaches a course for Stanford Online about generative AI. \"This is a small, but rapidly growing niche,\" he said.\n\nAI fluency can help just about anyone get ahead in their career, added Challapally. Workers who understand AI are \"able to move faster, make better decisions, and take on higher-leverage work,\" he said.\n\nHiring is also strong in healthcare, social assistance, and leisure and hospitality, according to recent data from the US Labor Department.\n\nLaura Ullrich, director of economic research at job site Indeed, expects the overall labor market to improve as long as the economy continues to grow. \"This low-hire, low-fire environment cannot last forever,\" she said. \"At some point, companies will need to start hiring more.\"\n\nIn the meantime, some workers are regaining a sense of control by taking on freelance or contract gigs that they could parley into full-time work should they get laid off. Others are starting their own businesses, tapping AI tools to get up and running quickly.\n\nAdopting a side hustle is safer than quitting a job and launching a search for a new one right now because the market is just so competitive, said John Ferguson, an HR consultant and former chief human resources officer at NASCAR.\n\n\"If you don't have the next opportunity lined up, I encourage you to stay where you are,\" he said. \"But also plan your exit strategy.\"",

    "title": "Martin Luther King Jr. was talking about a universal basic income before it was cool",
    "description": "Martin Luther King Jr. advocated for a guaranteed annual income in his 1967 book \"Where Do We Go From Here?\"",
    "fullText": "Billionaire tech bros like Sam Altman and Elon Musk like to think they operate on the futuristic fringe.\n\nOn at least one subject that is trendy in tech circles, however, they are way late: basic income.\n\nNearly six decades ago, Martin Luther King Jr. advocated for a form of basic income not unlike what AI leaders today suggest could be the salve to mitigate AI's impact on the workforce.\n\nKing wrote in his 1967 book, \"Where Do We Go From Here?\" that a guaranteed annual income could ultimately create \"widespread economic security.\"\n\n\"Personal conflicts between husband, wife, and children will diminish when the unjust measurement of human worth on a scale of dollars is eliminated,\" he wrote.\n\nA universal basic income is a recurring cash payment provided to all citizens of a population regardless of socioeconomic standing. A guaranteed basic income, on the other hand, refers to recurring cash payments made to specific citizens, such as those belonging to a certain socioeconomic group, for a set period of time.\n\nThe idea of a basic income has gained traction in recent years. Many US cities and counties have launched pilot programs, and some have made those programs permanent.\n\nKing's book came three years after former President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, making it illegal to discriminate based on race, color, sex, religion, or national origin. It was a time of widespread social unrest.\n\nIn the book, King sought to address ways for the community to move forward together, including addressing issues like poverty through a guaranteed annual income.\n\nIn his book, King wrote that proposing such an idea in the early 1900s \"would have been greeted with ridicule and denunciation as destructive of initiative and responsibility.\"\n\nIn fact, little has changed a century later. Some opponents of basic income programs still argue that the cash will dissuade workers from working. Numerous studies, however, have shown that recipients don't work less and often use the cash to find better work by taking classes and upskilling.\n\n\"At that time, economic status was considered the measure of the individual's abilities and talents. And in the thinking of that day, the absence of worldly goods indicated a want of industrious habits and moral fiber,\" King wrote. \"We've come a long way in our understanding of human motivation and of the blind operation of our economic system.\"\n\nKing wrote that shifts in the economy and discrimination can push people toward \"constant or frequent unemployment against their will.\"\n\nAs a result, he wrote that Americans must either create employment opportunities or create income so people can become active consumers. Unemployed citizens could take on jobs focused on boosting social good, King wrote.\n\nA guaranteed income program, he wrote, could help address social ills and improve mental health.\n\n\"If our nation can spend thirty-five billion dollars a year to fight an unjust, evil war in Vietnam, and twenty billion dollars to put a man on the moon, it can spend billions of dollars to put God's children on their own two feet right here on earth,\" King wrote.\n\nIn the nearly 60 years since \"Where Do We Go From Here?\" was published, basic income programs have remained a divisive topic.\n\nTechnologists like Musk, Altman, and Bill Gates believe some form of basic income will be necessary when AI is so smart it can do most anyone's jobs, including theirs.\n\nA handful of politicians have also advocated for basic income programs. A group of lawmakers last year proposed a nationwide guaranteed basic income pilot program spanning three years and 10,000 Americans. The monthly payments would cover the cost of a 2-bedroom apartment.\n\n\"Increasing automation and advancing AI have the potential to expand human flourishing. However, the concentration of control of those technologies into the hands of a few billionaires may mean the eventual loss of the livelihoods of millions of Americans,\" the lawmakers said in the press release.\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang also pushed for a universal basic income during his 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nThere remains, however, stiff resistance to the idea. Yang, despite promising $1,000 monthly checks to all adult Americans, dropped out early in the 2020 Democratic primaries after a poor showing.\n\nSome conservative politicians have pushed back against basic income programs, arguing that they discourage work, are expensive to fund, and amount to socialism.\n\n\"Is money a birthright now? Do we just get born and get money from the government?\" Republican Rep. John Gillette told Business Insider. \"Because I think the Founding Fathers would say that is very contrary to our capitalist system and encouraging people to work.\"\n\nDespite such political backlash, cities and counties all over the country have experimented with pilot programs.\n\nThey often provide groups of low-income Americans with no-strings-attached monthly checks over a period of a year or more, and then report their findings.\n\nIn one recent example, the New York City Council launched a new guaranteed basic income program for young residents navigating homelessness in December.\n\nIt's the kind of effort King would likely have supported.\n\n\"The dignity of the individual will flourish when the decisions concerning his life are in his own hands, when he has the assurance that his income is stable and certain, and when he knows that he has the means to seek self-improvement,\" King wrote in his book.",

    "fullText": "County Antrim Shield final: Cliftonville v Carrick Rangers\n\nVenue: Seaview, Belfast Date: Tuesday, 20 January Kick-off: 19:45 GMT\n\nCoverage: Live coverage on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app\n\nWhen asked what name has been on the County Antrim Shield the most, people's immediate response would likely be Linfield.\n\nHowever, the answer for who has had their name on it the most after the Blues may be more complicated than that as, after Ards' victory in 1994, a fan carved his name into the back of the trophy.\n\nRemaining on the shield for over 30 years, the engraving has only been removed in the last few seasons when Queen's University added a bar to the back of the trophy to help winner's lift it.\n\nBut how did someone's nickname end up on one of Northern Ireland's four senior trophies for so long?\n\nEvery fan has a different reaction when their club get their hands on a trophy that they have waited on for so long. Some are overcome with happiness, some may leap for joy and some shed a tear but not many turn to permanent markers.\n\nThe north Down side faced Crusaders in the 1994 showdown and sealed the trophy for the third time in their history when substitute David Straney scored twice in the final 10 minutes at the Oval.\n\nArds hadn't won a trophy in 20 years at that stage and lifelong fan Michael Kennedy, nicknamed Ned, was determined to make the moment last.\n\n\"The County Antrim Shield has always held a special place in Ards' fans hearts and when we won it, that evening, it came back to the club when we were playing at Castlereagh Park,\" Ards FC historian Adrian Monaghan told BBC Sport NI.\n\n\"We didn't have a proper trophy cabinet and the one we did have would have never held the County Antrim Shield, so what happened was the trophy went out into the lounge and was propped up.\n\n\"The club was open to all hours and then Ned said that he was going to write something on the back of it, so he wrote his name and Ards FC in indelible marker. We did not think much about it at the time.\"\n\nThe trophy kickstarted a successful spell for Roy Coyle's side, who went on to win the League Cup the following season before competing in the Uefa Intertoto Cup shortly after.\n\nThe years around the millennium proved to be challenging for the side who lost their home ground, Castlereagh Park, in 2000 but the engraving gave the fans something to laugh about during the anniversary dinner 15 years after the win.\n\n\"When collecting the trophy in 2009 at Solitude, they asked, 'do you know a fella called Ned?' Then showed me the back of the trophy and his name was still there,\" he continued.\n\n\"We had a good laugh that Ards would always have their name on the trophy and that is when we took the photo.\n\n\"Now, if Ned was still alive, he would find it hilarious that we are still talking about it.\"\n\nArds' only appearance in the showpiece since was in 2004, but they were beaten 2-0 by Linfield, so their name remained on the trophy four times, three times on the front and in pen on the back.\n\nNow the name is removed meaning that Ards could also be the only name to be removed.",

    "fullText": "Daniil Medvedev says he is trying to be \"as positive on the court as I am in life\" after he finally snapped his losing streak at Grand Slams with victory in the Australian Open first round.\n\nThe Russian - known for his fiery outbursts on court - suffered first-round defeats at the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open in 2025.\n\nBut he avoided a fourth successive early exit with an assured victory over Dutchman Jesper de Jong at Melbourne Park on Monday.\n\nThe 7-5 6-2 7-6 (7-2) win on Margaret Court Arena took his record to 6-0 this season after he triumphed at the Brisbane International earlier in January.\n\nSo, perhaps Medvedev - who destroyed a net camera in his lone Grand Slam win last season - is reaping the benefits of his \"big push to try to be more positive\".\n\n\"So far I'm doing it well,\" the 2021 US Open winner said.\n\n\"We don't know what's coming, but just trying to be positive on the court as I am in life.\"",

    "description": "Launching the Creusot Devlog!",
    "fullText": "Welcome to the Creusot Devlog, where we blog about the development of Creusot project,\na deductive verifier for Rust.\n\nThe plan is to have posts accompany our monthly releases, highlighting key features\nand writing about happenings in and around Creusot.\n\nLast week, the Creusot Team went to POPL 2026, a major academic PL conference.\n\nWe presented a tutorial on Creusot. More details below.\n\nArnaud Golfouse gave a talk at the CPP workshop (Certified Programs and Proofs):\n\nOne more Creusot paper will appear in JFLA 2026, a French-speaking academic conference taking place next week. This paper is about verifying an implementation of a tricky tree traversal algorithm (see also Threaded binary tree on Wikipedia) using Creusot:\n\nAlso next week, Li-yao Xia will give another presentation of Creusot at the RFMIG meeting\n(Rust Formal Methods Interest Group), online, on Monday, January 26 at 18:00 GMT (19:00 in France). It will focus on a work-in-progress case study:\nverifying slice methods in Rust's core library.\n\nCreusot 0.9.0 was released earlier this month, right before the start of POPL.\n\nThe Creusot tutorial walks you through the process of verifying a Rust program with Creusot.\nThe tutorial is available in the creusot-rs/tutorial repository.\nYou don't even need to install anything: you can try Creusot online in your browser! See the README \n\nThis uses a DevContainer, made possible by recently added support for installing Creusot with Nix.\n\nThis is a convenience enhancement for type invariants.\n\nA type invariant is a property that all values of a type should satisfy.\nThis is a natural way to encode well-formedness conditions of many data structures.\n\nFor example, below is a type of \"ordered pairs\", OPair,\nwith the type invariant that its fields are indeed ordered.\n\nevery function whose interface involves that type will implicitly assert its type invariant\nin the function's preconditions and postconditions.\n\nThe problem arises when we use such a type in a loop. For example:\n\nIn that loop, we call self.bump, which requires self to satisfy its type invariant.\n\nPreviously, we had to explicitly state the loop invariant, that the type invariant is preserved by each iteration of the loop body:\n\nThis kind of condition easy to forget for newcomers,\nand becomes quite cumbersome as more type invariants are involved.\n\nNow this invariant is automatically inserted by Creusot.\n\nThat's not all. It may still be desirable to write loops\nthat don't preserve the type invariant—for example, in the initialization\nof a complex data structure.\n\nAlthough one might imagine a flag to toggle this behavior, we propose an\nautomatic but conservative solution that guesses right in most cases:\na type invariant is inserted in a loop invariant only if the last\nwrite to a given variable before (re)entering the loop comes from\na function boundary.\n\nFor the example above,\nself is written to by the caller of the function first, and then\n\nso we can safely insert that type invariant as a loop invariant.\n\nFor a counterexample, below we replaced the bump call with a direct\nassignment to a field of self. Such assignments are not required to\npreserve the type invariant of self in general (even though in this case it does).\nIndeed, we expect field assignments to occur as part of the implementation\nof a data structure, temporarily breaking type invariants.\nConsequently, Creusot does not insert the type invariant implicitly in this case.\nThe user can still provide it if necessary.\n\nCreusot decides whether to insert such type invariants by performing\na little static analysis, a standard exercise in compiler writing.\n\nThis analysis also detects mutable variables that are not actually written to,\nso that Creusot can also insert invariants that say \"this value hasn't changed\nsince the beginning of the loop\".\n\nCreusot's standard library has been renamed from creusot_contracts\nto creusot_std.\n\nThis library provides macros to enable writing contracts (requires, etc.),\nand it also contains contracts for the Rust standard library, hence the\nold name creusot_contracts. The new name creusot_std better conveys the\nidea that it's a fundamental library to be imported by all Creusot users.\n\nThe creusot_std library now features a flag std which can be disabled\nfor no_std projects. This is part of ongoing work to support the verification\nof low-level embedded code.\n\nDisabling std reduces the dependencies of creusot_std to core and alloc.\nThis removes contracts for a few data structures such as hashmaps.\nIn the future, it may be possible to avoid the dependency on alloc as well,\nbut it seems that most no_std projects also depend on alloc anyway.\n\nCreusot takes its first step in the formal verification of concurrent programs.\nOur first working example is parallel_add\n(for comparison, here is the equivalent Rust code without ghost annotations).\n\nThis builds on top of the aforementioned work on ghost ownership presented at CPP 2026.\nFor concurrency, this release makes two key additions to the creusot_std library:\nthe AtomicI32\ntype—a ghost-aware wrapper around std::sync::atomic::AtomicI32—and\na notion of AtomicInvariant inspired by Iris, a separation logic framework in Rocq.\nFor now, this only supports sequential consistency. There is ongoing\nwork to also provide support for relaxed memory models.\n\nStay tuned for future updates on Creusot!",

    "fullText": "on January 19, 2026 at 1:16AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nDuring the fighting game heyday of the 1990s, there were loads of options available on the Super Nintendo, with classics such as Street Fighter 2, Mortal Kombat, and Killer Instinct being household names. However, as time passed and Nintendo experimented with unconventional hardware compared to Sony or Microsoft, the chances you’d find a fighting game on that system that wasn’t developed by Nintendo diminished. That’s not to say there weren’t options, but things were a bit barren for quite a while.\n\nThankfully, we now live in happier times where, thanks to the Switch’s hybrid console and handheld approach, the genre has seen a resurgence. Here you’ll find a diverse list ranging from competitive arcade brawlers and platform fighters to retro collections and some less conventional picks. A few of these are also console exclusive, meaning you won’t find them anywhere else.\n\nAll of the listed games will work on Nintendo Switch 2, and in some cases, it’s recommended that you only play them on the newer handheld. You’ll mostly see better load times across the board, but there’s occasionally added visual clarity and improved frame rates that make specific titles that are available on other platforms a bit more comparable. Silky smooth gameplay is mandatory to play fighting games well, as players need time to react to incoming blows, and thankfully, in the cases where the Switch 1 doesn’t achieve these requirements, the Switch 2 picks up the slack.\n\nOnly one of these fighting games is mandatory for any Switch library, and that’s Super Smash Bros Ultimate. This platform fighter boasts a massive roster featuring some of the most popular video game characters. We’re not just talking about the Nintendo-owned ones, as characters originally made by Konami, Capcom, Sega, Bandai Namco, and many more are part of the 69 fighters with unique moves, with several more acting as ‘Echo’ skins that function the same, but may have subtle animation movements; for example, Samus runs while Dark Samus floats. The DLC takes this base roster number up to 82, and it’s honestly essential to get the most out of this ambitious game.\n\nSmash Ultimate isn’t just a bloated game with a huge roster of fighters to unlock. Every character has its own Classic mode that features a bespoke lineup of opponents, including one of several boss fights based on key franchises. This even includes newcomers Simon and Richter Belmont, who do fight Dracula at the end of their Classic mode. You also have local multiplayer with different rules and support for up to eight players, including wider levels to support the boosted player count. There’s also The World of Light, a lengthy campaign where you move around several board game-like areas and, with the help of spirits you equip to boost your stats, fight augmented clones of fighters created by a reality-ending cosmic deity to unlock the path ahead.\n\nOn Switch 2, the load times are lightning fast, giving you quicker win screens and making modes like Squad Strike instantly load in new characters instead of stuttering for a short time. It’s very minor and likely due to the hardware rather than a specific Switch 2 update, but it’s welcome nonetheless. You’ll likely already have Super Smash Bros Ultimate, as it’s essential for anyone who has or had the Nintendo Switch. If you don’t, though, it’s probably the most feature-rich fighting game on the platform and well worth picking up.\n\nThe only Nintendo console Street Fighter 6 is playable on is the Switch 2, but it’s a fantastic return to form for Capcom’s premier fighting game. Its roster is the best in the series so far, ranging from the classic World Warriors from Street Fighter 2 to newcomers with a variety of different fighting styles. It’s also got the most diverse base mechanics in a Street Fighter game to date, adding a Drive gauge that enables you to parry, counter, and dash with a few different button combinations, letting you press the advantage or weather a particularly destructive combo.\n\nStreet Fighter 6 is split into three different rooms. Arcade, Training, and local Versus modes are all part of the offline branch, while World Tour has you create a custom character’s appearance, fighting against the world’s best fighters to gain stats and learn new moves via the main cast who act as mentors. You also have online lobbies, which allow players to match up against each other with conventional characters, as well as use their World Tour fighter in special battles, and even play a rotating selection of classic Capcom Arcade games.\n\nSwitch 2 owners also get the first couple of seasons of DLC characters at no extra cost, featuring eight bonus fighters to play as in the various arcade and versus modes, as well as become your mentor in World Tour. Online also feels really good, featuring rollback netcode and crossplay with the other versions. In comparison to the PC or other console versions, Street Fighter 6 on Switch 2 doesn’t have quite as detailed visuals. However, it has decent performance, as long as you set the console to 120Hz, which gives you tighter button inputs for snappier reaction times. Even though the exclusive gyro modes are gimmicky at best, you’re not getting a significantly nerfed version if you can only get the Switch 2 version.\n\nDragon Ball FighterZ is the best anime fighter available, and also one of the best team fighters. With a roster that includes favorites from the mainline Dragon Ball Z and Super shows, as well as DLC that adds Dragon Ball GT and the DBZ movie villains, it’s clear that Arc System Works loves the late Akira Toriyama’s most famous work. The moves for each feel like a natural fit, with supers capable of an explosive Destructive Finish if you hit an opponent with low health, while show-referencing Dramatic Finishes require specific stages and a button or special move. Thanks to Arc System Works’ stunning cell-shading techniques, FighterZ also closely resembles the look of the anime itself, occasionally surpassing it when reenacting key moments from the show, such as the end of Goku vs Frieza on Namek or Teen Gohan vs. Perfect Cell.\n\nCompared to other 3v3 fighters, there are several mechanics to learn. Auto-combos allow new players to hit their opponent with entire strings, ending in a devastating super move. This makes it accessible to just about anyone, but Dragon Ball FighterZ also rewards timing with its other mechanics. Deflection of basic projectiles is possible with a button press, and the Dragon Rush closes the gap between you in an instant, catching your rival off guard. There’s also a story mode featuring three distinct arcs and a brand new fighter, Android 21, whose design was approved by Toriyama.\n\nWhile there’s no specific Switch 2 upgrade, Dragon Ball FighterZ did get a significant balance patch in October 2025 that introduces a brand new Z-Reflect mechanic. We also got confirmation that SSJ4 Goku (Daima) will be a new character added to the roster in 2026. Unfortunately, there’s still no word on whether we’ll ever see crossplay support in the future. However, since Arc System Works is still actively updating it outside of minor balance patches, there’s a slim chance.\n\nArc System Works also has its own fighting game series on the Switch family of consoles, and it’s also the most accessible one in the series. Guilty Gear Strive is a reboot of sorts, slimming down the mechanics of this anime fighter to make it more forgiving for newcomers while also keeping just enough depth for veterans. Key mechanics include ways to defend yourself from oncoming attacks, such as Faultless Defense, which is handy for negating and pushing away an attacker. That said, it also features four different types of Roman Cancel, a universal technique that lets players cancel moves to extend combos at the cost of some of the Tension gauge (this game’s version of a super meter).\n\nIn addition to the many arcade, training, and online modes, all of which run buttery smooth on the Switch, there are also two full-length story modes. Despite being non-playable in-engine Original Video Animations (OVAs), similar to those released directly to home video in the 1990s, they look stunning, do a decent job of expanding the universe, and give vital context to character rivalries and motivations. The soundtrack also stands out as each song has lyrics that are meaningful to the characters it’s associated with.\n\nThis recommendation does come with a caveat. While it was a little behind the other versions for a good few months, Guilty Gear Strive on the Switch now has ranked matches and all of the Season 4 characters, which include, among others, Kushinada from Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. Unfortunately, the sole sticking point is that the Switch version cannot link to Xbox, PlayStation, or PC fighters, severely limiting the online fighting pool. Hopefully, this is next on the list of changes, but until then, Strive is perfectly playable and handles very well on the Nintendo console.\n\nMortal Kombat 1 is a big departure from NetherRealm Studios’ long-running fighting series, in that you now fight with a partner by your side. In many ways, it takes inspiration from Capcom’s original Marvel vs. Capcom. By summoning what MK1 calls a Kameo character, you can extend your combos with one of three different moves. This adds to the core mechanics that remain unchanged from Mortal Kombat 9, which give you powered-up special moves, combo breakers, and powerful X-Ray attacks. Of course, there are also a huge number of gory fatalities, including ones performed by Kameo characters and even the long-awaited return of Animalities, where your character turns into a giant animal to kill your opponent’s dazed fighter.\n\nWhere NetherRealm’s games are great to play with friends or online, and generally Mortal Kombat 1 is great at this too, the single-player offerings are substantial enough to recommend them even if you don’t care about multiplayer. The campaign is a reboot of sorts to the established Mortal Kombat canon, redefining relationships between its cast, along with big twists that make it a thoroughly enjoyable romp and unlock a playable fighter for finishing it. There are also seasonal Krypt modes, giving players unlockable goodies as a reward for overcoming fights with conditions that are more often than not stacked against you, as well as Tower modes for a more arcade-like experience.\n\nWith all of this said, we only recommend Mortal Kombat 1 if you own a Switch 2. While it has seen many patches since the day one launch, even now on the base Switch, it looks as if someone’s smeared vaseline all over your screen. Its frequent frame rate stuttering, particularly when calling in Kameo characters, means you’ll drop combos and experience a lack of responsiveness throughout. The Switch 2 stabilizes the frame rate to a constant 60fps, and while it still doesn’t hit the visual highs of the PC version, it is now of decent enough quality that we can recommend it.\n\nIf you have a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription, Soulcalibur 2 is one of the backwards-compatible GameCube games on offer at launch, and it’s the best version. It’s not just because it features Link from The Legend of Zelda as a guest character; the performance is a little tighter compared to the PS2 version, which was subject to frame hitching. While the Xbox did have 720p visuals, it lacked widescreen support. With modern upscaling options available via the Switch 2’s GameCube emulation, the improved resolution means significantly less these days.\n\nSo aside from Link and the fairly sizable roster, what makes Soulcalibur 2 so special? Much like the Dreamcast port of the previous game, which was actually better in every way compared to the arcade version, with some excellent mechanics that became series staples, such as revisions to the Guard Impact system to simplify what’s effective against each type of attack. Other defensive options include the Guard Break, which counters attacks and leaves the opponent open to blows of your own. It also feels faster than previous games in the series, and thanks to the improvements in GameCube emulation over the years, this version feels as good, if not better, than the original did.\n\nSoulcalibur 2 includes multiple game modes that were popular at the time, such as robust training, a survival gauntlet, and even some that are unlockable via the exclusive Weapon Master campaign. This single-player mode has players travel the world in search of challenges, such as fighting while a gale blows you towards the edge of the arena, or entire dungeons filled with enemies and traps. It’s how you unlock all the bonus characters and just about everything else that Soulcalibur 2 has to offer. While a bit primitive compared to Mortal Kombat 1’s Krypt, it’s still a fantastic addition.\n\nWhile Tekken hasn’t graced the Switch family of consoles as of yet, the closest you’ll get for now is Pokkén Tournament DX. This upgraded port of the Wii U spinoff includes 21 Pokémon to choose from in battle, with two more added as DLC. Each one has two different movesets; the Field Phase uses projectiles, and the Duel Phase is more like a conventional Tekken game. Landing a certain number of blows will shift the phases, keeping both players on their toes and opening up new strategies. Players can also use Support Pokémon to aid them with one-time effects, while the Burst Mode allows for temporary buffs and Mega Evolution.\n\nModes include the Ferrum League, where you compete in battles to increase your rankings in the various Leagues, as well as single and local battles against a friend for shorter bouts that you can customize the rules to add special items or even fight in teams of three. You can also take part in daily challenges that give you skill points for completing each objective. Skill points earned this way increase that Pokémon’s stats, while Poké Gold earned can be used to alter your avatar’s appearance.\n\nIt runs well on the original Switch, and while there are no noticeable performance upgrades on the Switch 2, outside of faster loading times, it’s perfectly playable on the system. It’s worth noting that some Pokémon in the roster received new Mega Evolutions in Pokémon Legends ZA, so it’s unlikely that Mega Chandelure and any new forms from the Mega Dimension DLC will appear in the future.\n\nNot many of SNK’s fighting games are available on the Switch family of consoles just yet, but we’d imagine that more will be coming now that the Switch 2 is more widely available. However, the Switch did at least get Samurai Shodown, the revival of SNK’s historical weapon-based four-button fighter, which is less focused on combos and more on spacing (or footsies, as the fighting game community commonly defines it). Counters are especially painful, especially if you manage to land a heavy attack. Your opponent will certainly feel it as a chunk of their health bar suddenly disappears.\n\nSamurai Shodown’s simple controls make it more accessible by default, and by emphasizing deliberate strikes over combos, you have less complexity overall. But it’s still a game that punishes carelessness, as disarming an opponent is possible and can be devastating. Meanwhile, the Rage Gauge allows you to perform one-time super moves that will almost certainly end the round. Blood splatters and violence aside, Samurai Shodown’s visuals are breathtakingly beautiful, with its striking character designs and gorgeous, scenic stage designs.\n\nOf all the games on this list, Samurai Shodown feels the most barren. Its lack of game modes means that you’re getting a more arcade-like experience. However, this streamlined approach does make it more affordable than a bigger-budget title. Though there are no upgrades with the Switch 2, the base game did get several DLC characters, including Baiken from the Guilty Gear series as the first-ever crossover character.\n\nArms is unique compared to the rest of the fighting games on this list. Its motion-based controls and modular hand combinations give its roster of pugilists a tad more flexibility. While all the moves are technically shared across every character, meaning you don’t need to memorize all sorts of different combinations, how each brawler or even each hand choice executes a move gives the game much-needed complexity. Fighters begin with access to just three hand types. However, you can unlock more via the Arms Getter mode, where you spend coins to participate in a minigame for a chance to win new hand types for that character.\n\nGetting coins means conquering the arcade-like Grand Prix, as well as playing some of the more unusual sports-like modes like V-Ball or Hoops, or challenging a gauntlet of 100 enemies. You can also play online in ranked matches, experience the chaotic party mode that bundles up to 20 players in one lobby, or connect Switch systems wirelessly for a party-style match for up to eight devices at once.\n\nArms is another one of those fighting games that’s improved significantly when played on the Switch 2, boasting faster loading times, improved image quality, and a boost to the frame rate. It also features HDR support, taking full advantage of the Switch 2’s LCD screen, which is capable of displaying those vibrant colors. Taking full advantage of all the game’s multiplayer modes years after launch might be a hard sell, especially the local wireless mode, but with the new upgrades to the base game, it may still be worth a look for a fun game night.\n\nFor years, there was no way to play the games in this collection without resorting to emulation, but Marvel vs. Capcom: Fighting Collection brings the entire classic arcade series in one bundle. These are perfect ports of all 7 Capcom-developed Marvel games, from X-Men: Children of the Atom to Marvel vs Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, and even The Punisher as a bonus beat-em-up option. Some of the included games have features that you can toggle between to add secret fighters, tinker with the light intensity so it’s not as disruptive, and even reactivate a glitch that was patched out of one game in the collection.\n\nEach one of the emulated fighting games has its merit. You can see how the series evolved from a rather basic fighter in X-Men: Children of the Atom, how the divisive Infinity Stones affect Marvel Super Heroes gameplay, when the series began to focus on multi-fighter teams with X-Men vs. Street Fighter, the assists that appear in Marvel vs. Capcom, and finally, the 3v3 fights that define Marvel vs. Capcom 2. These games inspired the development of the more modern games on this list, such as Dragon Ball FighterZ and Mortal Kombat 1.\n\nIncluded in the collection is a Museum where you can see the key art, pamphlets, and instruction cards for every game. You also get to view scans of the character design drawings and stage concepts, preserving a little bit of history in a convenient place, and listen to both the original soundtracks (we still have Marvel vs Capcom 2’s music on loop), and remixes especially created for the collection. While there are a handful of Capcom arcade compilations available for the Switch, this is the only one that feels somewhat essential to own, just in case it disappears once more.\n\nWhile we’re still waiting for the sequel to grace the Switch 2, hopefully in the not-too-distant future, Rivals of Aether is the best platform fighter not officially made by Nintendo. Created as a spiritual sequel to a fan-made demake of the original Super Smash Bros running on the Game Boy, this 2D fighter takes lots of inspiration from the team’s previous project. Your chosen champion conjures the elements to knock the competition off the stage, while also affecting the stage in some way.\n\nCharacters are mostly original animal-based designs that represent one of the four elements. Bugs that throw massive rocks, fire-breathing lions, and even an orca-bear hybrid that throws puddles to teleport out of are just some of the weird and wonderful designs available. Rivals of Aether also features a few guest characters from well-known indie games, namely Ori and Shovel Knight, who fit in surprisingly well with the rest of the cast.\n\nCompared to the latest Super Smash Bros, Rivals of Aether doesn’t quite have the staying power due to a lack of modes. However, the available ones are well worth playing, such as the single-player Story mode that has you hop around each of the citadels for the base roster, where you must battle set characters to progress. You can also opt to fight in the co-op wave-based Abyss Endless mode, or challenge each of your buddies to a round of tetherball where you hit a ball tied to a string from your side to wrap it around a column to win points. Rivals of Aether may not be the most original game mechanically, but that doesn’t stop it from being a fun platform fighter alternative.\n\nIn SpiderHeck, you play as arachnids with laser swords and blasters. You and your opponents will hop around one of the many maps on offer in a first-to-eight-wins contest, where one false move could spell certain doom. Striking a rival’s weapon will make you bounce a fair distance, and each one has a limited number of uses, meaning you’ll frequently be scrambling for a new one.\n\nIt’s not just your rivals that you need to worry about, as spring pads will propel you and ordinance, such as bombs and rockets, in the direction they’re facing. There’s also the lava surrounding the battlefield that will fry you. While relatively simple to control as far as platform fighters are concerned, it’s tough to master the controls, particularly if you’re not used to similar rope-swinging mechanics such as any of the Worms games.\n\nNeverjam has, since launch, added more maps to scuttle your way across, as well as parkour challenges that become fiendishly difficult as you swing around using your webs. There are also tons of cool hats you can unlock to make your slick spider stand out from the crowd. There’s also the Tower of Heck, a cooperative mode that limits the weapon types on offer and can be played single-player. This chaotic creepy-crawly combat simulator is best played with three other players around a sofa, Joy-Cons in hand, with no prior experience and a bunch of drinks and snacks to whittle away an evening.",

    "title": "Bizarre Facts You Probably Didn't Know About Yellowstone National Park",
    "description": "Yellowstone National Park is one of the most popular and fascinating parks in the U.S. Naturally, there are quite a few bizarre things associated with it.",
    "fullText": "The otherworldly landscapes of Yellowstone National Park have captured imaginations for centuries, with their bubbling mud pots, peculiar rainbow-colored pools, and dramatic geysers that shoot skyward on a schedule all of their own. Yet while this strange geothermal wonderland is famous for its mind-blowing physical features, it's also home to strange secrets and seemingly unexplained phenomena that are even more bizarre.\n\nYellowstone became the world's first national park in 1872, to protect the unusual ecosystem and its wild inhabitants. Today, Yellowstone is one of the most popular parks in the U.S. with over 4.7 million visitors each year. That sounds like a lot, but at 3,472 square miles, Yellowstone is so vast that it's easy to lose the crowds and head off into the wilderness. It's an enigmatic and intriguing place — one that we may never fully understand — but this air of mystery just adds to the appeal.\n\nFor instance, did you know that Yellowstone Lake \"sings\" in winter, or that, according to some, parts of the park are \"haunted?\" In this article we'll reveal both science and speculation as we uncover some of the weirdest mysteries of Yellowstone. We'll introduce you to spooky ghosts, a lost thistle-eating explorer, and a bunch of heat-loving organisms that seem otherworldly. Knowing the following bizarre facts about Yellowstone will help deepen your experience of this famous but odd national park.\n\nYellowstone in winter is magical, with frozen waterfalls glistening in the sun, and snow-laden forests resonating with the howls of wolves. At the hot springs, water continues to bubble, while the rising steam gives everything nearby an ethereal coating of frost. Yet nothing is as eerie as the mysterious musical noises that can be heard coming from Yellowstone Lake.\n\nThis strange symphony of sound occurs when the lake is frozen sometime between December and May. Since the 19th century, explorers and park workers have reported hearing haunting \"lake music\" coming from the ice. One of the first records comes from Captain Hiram Chittenden's 1895 book \"Yellowstone National Park,\" in which he writes \"a most singular and interesting acoustic phenomenon of this region ... is the occurrence of strange and indefinable overhead sounds.\" He goes on to say that the noises are similar to \"the ringing of telegraph wires or the humming of a swarm of bees.\" Other visitors have heard deep pipe organ notes and even the sounds of flying birds. Meanwhile, supervisor park ranger Kristine Brunsman commented to Thrillist that \"in December 2020, I heard songs I'd never heard before — akin to sonar pings or the call of a whale.\"\n\nDespite several scientific studies, no one knows the true source of these sounds. One theory suggests that water flowing beneath the ice causes cracks which spread, thus creating these bizarre noises. Other scientists have suggested that the sounds are the result of earthquakes, air whirlpools, or temperature inversions, but no conclusive evidence has been found. Yellowstone is one of the best U.S. national parks for winter hiking, so next time you visit, listen out for nature's extraordinary music.\n\nYou might already be aware that there's a volcano beneath Yellowstone National Park, but did you know that it's a supervolcano? It's active too, as evidenced by the ongoing geothermal activity in the park, with explosive geysers, bubbling mud pools, and steaming hot springs characterizing the wild landscape. It's a weird feeling, knowing that just by visiting Yellowstone, you're walking on top of a supervolcano.\n\nYellowstone was named a supervolcano after a series of massive eruptions. The first, which occurred 2.1 million years ago, is believed to have been one of the largest volcanic eruptions in the world. The second followed 1.3 million years ago, while the third and most recent mega eruption was 631,000 years ago. This latter event created the Yellowstone Caldera as we know it today. There have been several smaller eruptions in the following centuries, and Yellowstone remains one of the largest active volcanoes on the planet.\n\nSo, what about the future? Yellowstone will likely erupt again, but probably not for thousands, or even millions of years, so visitors today needn't worry. The area is closely monitored by geologists at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, and it's predicted that any future eruption in the region would be preceded by a long period of intense volcanic activity — likely lava flows — giving plenty of warning for evacuation.\n\nYellowstone is a hotbed of volcanic activity, with more than 10,000 active hydrothermal features like mud pools, fumaroles, and hot springs punctuating the wild landscape. Yet the stars of the show are undoubtedly the geysers, as they spew water skywards during spectacular eruptions. There are up to 700 active geysers within the national park each year, which is astonishing since there are fewer than 500 annually erupting geysers in the rest of the world combined.\n\nThis vibrant geyser basin has a unique ecological environment, which means each geyser behaves a little differently compared to the next. Some geysers have predictable eruptions which are helpful for visitor viewing, but most are more erratic in their behavior. Old Faithful is considered the most famous geyser in Yellowstone, thanks to its easy access and regular eruptions, which occur approximately every 35 to 120 minutes. Each eruption lasts for up to 5 minutes, with the blast sometimes reaching 184 feet.\n\nMeanwhile, Grand Geyser is the world's tallest predictable geyser, with water bursts shooting up to 200 feet. Less reliable is Steamboat Geyser, which is more temperamental in its timing with months or even years passing between major eruptions. Yet if you get lucky and manage to catch the event, you'll witness water plumes of over 300 feet, sometimes lasting for around 40 minutes. You can check the latest Yellowstone geyser eruption predictions on the National Park Service website.\n\nOne of the most bizarre tales to come out of Yellowstone National Park was from an 1877 expedition (via Yellowstone Gate), during which the explorers used Old Faithful to wash their clothes. The following year, team member Frank D. Carpenter published his travelogue \"The Wonders of Geyser Land: A Trip to the Yellowstone National Park,\" giving an account of the unusual experiment.\n\nHe writes that while camped near the geyser, the explorers decided to do their washing in Old Faithful since \"such an opportunity for \"boiling clothes\" will not be presented again soon.\" The team used several methods to secure their garments, including wrapping them in a pillowcase and weighing them down with stones. They then \"repaired to the laundry, Old Faithful\" before casting the clothing into the water. The bundles sank below the surface, and for a moment the onlookers thought their possessions were gone forever. Yet after a few moments, the geyser blew and the wide-eyed explorers watched the \"clothes, jacket, rags ... shoot up to a distance of a hundred feet or more.\" Upon retrieving the items, Frank and his companions were delighted to discover that they were all clean.\n\nSince then, irresponsible visitors have thrown all manner of objects into Yellowstone's geysers, from handkerchiefs and soap to coins and even couches. However, in more recent years, attitudes toward the environment have changed, and today one of the most upsetting mistakes tourists make in Yellowstone is throwing objects into thermal pools. The park service work hard to recover trash from the water, and throwing objects into Yellowstone's hydrothermal pools is now prohibited.\n\nThere's a remote area of Yellowstone covering 50 square miles in Idaho nicknamed the Zone of Death, where federal jurisdiction is in conflict with the Constitution's Sixth Amendment. This means that in theory, murder, or any other serious crime, could go unpunished here due to a technicality.\n\nAlthough Yellowstone sits mainly in Wyoming, it also spills over the border into the neighboring states of Montana and Idaho. To avoid lengthy arguments about authority, Congress declared the park to be federal, rather than state property. It then assigned jurisdiction of Yellowstone to the U.S. District Court of Wyoming in 1872, thereby creating a bizarre legal loophole. Meanwhile, the Sixth Amendment promises a public trial in the state where the murder is carried out, yet in the remote Idaho section of the park, there aren't any residents. This means that a jury cannot be formed, and therefore a trial would be impossible. It's an unusual conflict, and one that hasn't yet been resolved. It's not thought that anyone has tested this legal loophole, luckily.\n\nOne of the most peculiar features in Yellowstone National Park is the brightly colored water in some of the thermal pools. The vibrant oranges, yellows, greens, and blues bring an otherworldly feel to the landscape, showing off another weird side of nature. For years, people assumed these vivid hues were caused by minerals, because people assumed no living organism could survive in such hot or acidic conditions. Yet scientists now believe that trillions of microscopic creatures invisible to the human eye are responsible for the strange colors.\n\nKnown as thermophiles, these unseen organisms thrive in intensely hot environments, on the edge of existence. They likely descend from the first microorganisms on Earth, and their presence in such extreme conditions supports the theory that there could be life on Mars.\n\nEven more bizarrely, the color comes from the thermophilic microbes themselves. When you see the rings of orange, yellow, and green in the thermal pools, you're actually looking at huge amounts of these strange microorganisms, all bunched together to form a mass of color. Different thermophiles flourish in different temperatures, so the distinct color variations in the pools indicate the change in water temperature while also showing where one species stops and another begins. The best places to see these unusual color changes include Grand Prismatic Spring, Morning Glory Pool, and Rainbow Pool. Go around midday when the sun is overhead to see the colors at their most vivid.\n\nYellowstone is a place of mystery, so it's not surprising that several people have disappeared without trace in the national park over the years, mirroring similar bizarre tales from the Grand Canyon. From an elk hunter who went missing in 1991 to an 8-year-old boy who vanished from a picnic area in 1966, many disappearances remain unsolved. However, there are happy endings to some misadventures, with the strangest being the story of Truman Everts, a former tax collector from Montana who claimed he was saved by a helpful ghost.\n\nIn 1870, Everts took part in the Washburn-Langford-Doane expedition into Yellowstone, with the aim of charting the wild territory, according to Idaho Falls Magazine. It was during this trip that Old Faithful was given its name, thanks to the regularity of the eruptions. Part way through the expedition, Everts got lost near Yellowstone Lake at the onset of winter. His pack horse ran off with his supplies, leaving him to fend for himself for 37 days in the wilderness.\n\nRemarkably, Everts lived to tell the tale, despite being close to starvation. Having survived a mountain lion attack and a forest fire which he inadvertently started, the explorer sustained himself by eating thistle roots before, according to his account, a ghostly stranger led him to safety (via Cowboy State Daily). Everts claimed that a ghostly apparition warned him against climbing a dangerous mountain, instead urging him to head in a safer direction, retracing his steps to the Yellowstone River. He also claimed the ghost accompanied him during the long trek until he was eventually found by a search party. Whether his experiences were truth or delusion, it's certainly one of the more bizarre tales from Yellowstone.\n\nMost lakes in the world drain into a single sea or ocean, but Yellowstone's Isa Lake drains into two. In fact, this is the only natural lake in the world with water running into both the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. There are a couple of explanations for this bizarre double drainage phenomenon.\n\nFirstly, Isa Lake lies on top of the Continental Divide between Yellowstone's Old Faithful and West Thumb Geyser Basin, with the watersheds of the two oceans on either side. This means that water from the lake will understandably drain in both directions. Strangely, however, it's not that simple. You'd think that the west side of the lake would drain into the Pacific and the east side into the Atlantic, but it's actually the other way around, thanks to Yellowstone's unusual topography. In fact, the western end of the lake flows into the Firehole River, and eventually the Atlantic Ocean, while the eastern end makes its way into the Columba River before reaching the Pacific Ocean, especially during springtime when the winter snows melt.\n\nIn 2010, a millionaire art dealer from New Mexico named Forrest Fenn hid a treasure chest containing valuables from his collection worth around $2 million. After being diagnosed with cancer, Fenn had decided to have a bit of fun with his wealth, which he knew he couldn't take with him when he died. He then wrote a challenging poem containing clues about the location of the chest, leading hundreds of thousands of people from around the world on a decade-long quest for gold.\n\nDespite the initial reason for the mission, and the fact that several questers sadly perished while trying to find the treasure, this bizarre story does have a cheerful conclusion. Fenn ended up beating his cancer and lived long enough to see the hunt come to an end.\n\nThe chest was eventually found in 2020 by a medical student called Jack Stuef. He'd been searching for the treasure for 2 years before finding it hidden in Yellowstone National Park, reportedly beside Nine Mile Hole. Fenn spent many holidays in Yellowstone when he was young, which is perhaps why he buried his treasure here. Inside the chest were gold nuggets, jewels, coins, and antiques, most of which Stuef sold for $1.26 million to help clear his medical school debts.\n\nBison are possibly the most iconic mammals in Yellowstone, and astonishingly, there have been free-ranging herds living here since prehistoric times. Scientific analysis of lake sediment from Yellowstone uncovered the presence of ancient bison dung, thereby revealing that these animals were living here around 2,300 years ago. It's incredible to think that way before they became symbols of the American West, the bison of Yellowstone were roaming the valleys and mountains in this region.\n\nThousands of individuals now graze within the national park, and today the population is the largest on U.S. public land after surviving an extinction threat from hunting and poaching in the 1800s and 1900s. The bison are a popular sight for Yellowstone visitors, and the herds have a year-round presence in the Hayden and Lamar valleys.\n\nIf you want to see bison but don't fancy battling the summer crowds, one of the best times of year to visit Yellowstone National Park for wildlife viewing is spring. The roads are open again after the winter snow closures, and the plains are teeming with newborns. It's a great time to see bison calves taking their first wobbly steps. If you can't get enough of these prehistoric icons, you can also see bison roam in other parks like Montana's National Bison Range and Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota.\n\nOld hotels and ghost sightings seem to go hand in hand, so it stands to reason that Yellowstone's Old Faithful Inn has a few spooky stories up its sleeve. This presumably-haunted inn opened in 1904, and is believed to have been collecting shadowy inhabitants ever since.\n\nOne of the most grisly tales features the ghost of a headless, teenage bride, who is said to roam around the inn after a fateful honeymoon in 1915. According to the legend, she met her horrific demise in Room 127 after an argument with her gambler husband. Her missing head was rumored to be later discovered hidden on the hotel's crow's nest walkway. The subsequent disappearance of the husband led to much speculation, but the murder was never solved. While there's little evidence to support this myth, several hotel guests have reported sightings of the headless girl over the years, in the bedroom and on the crow's nest staircase.\n\nOther ghostly occurrences at the Old Faithful Inn include footsteps in the hotel corridors when no one else is around, doors opening and closing by themselves, and a floating female apparition in 19th century clothing by the bed in Room 2. One worker even said she witnessed a fire extinguisher moving all by itself, turning upside down as she walked past. If you're staying at the inn and fancy a spot of ghost hunting, book into Room 127 or Room 2 for the best chance of a paranormal encounter.\n\nReady to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips?",

Few things test communication, adaptability, and friendship like trying to serve meals under pressure, while hot-headed customers or food inspectors breathe down your neck.\n\nThe games on this list turn simple mechanics into high-stakes teamwork, and push the limits of even the most laid-back friendships. Many of the games are perfect for players of all ages, those who are new to gaming, and people looking for a casual experience with friends. As long as you don't cry over split milk, you'll get a lot out of these culinary co-op classics.\n\nIf you like a co-op experience but can't stand to use the kitchen when someone else is in there (valid), check out our best couch co-op games list for similar vibes without the foodie flavour.\n\nOvercooked! All You Can Eat is often the first name that comes up when people talk about co-op cooking games, and for good reason. This collection brings together multiple Overcooked experiences into one package, focusing entirely on the cooperative chaos offered by the franchise. Players work together to prepare, cook, and serve dishes across a series of increasingly absurd kitchens, many of which actively interfere with your ability to function as a team, so pretty standard for the catering industry.\n\nIdeal for players who enjoy fast-paced action and don’t mind getting a little heated in the kitchen, Overcooked! All You Can Eat is especially well-suited for local co-op sessions, where you can embrace your inner Gordon Ramsay and get your point across in an instant. This edition also features an assist mode, where several accessibility options mean everyone can join in, whatever their chef-ing ability. Overcooked also made it onto our best Xbox co-op games list, and works flawlessly either locally or online.\n\nGameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom\n\nYou can probably guess the premise of One Armed Cook without much prompting: you're a cook and you have one arm. But the simple concept gives way to hours of physics-based fun when you consider that between you and a friend, you'll have all the required arms. The game very quickly goes from \"I'm not doing too badly, considering,\" to \"oh my god the floor is covered in onions,\" so if you want the video game equivalent of a three-legged race, you don't have to look much further.\n\nCarrying ingredients, chopping food, and assembling dishes often requires both of you working in sync, especially when dealing with awkward customers or a full house. One Armed Cook is best enjoyed by pals who appreciate goofy, unpredictable gameplay and don’t mind failing spectacularly on the way to success.\n\nPlateUp! blends the more traditional elements of co-op cooking with light restaurant management, meaning it's as much about planning ahead as it is about the actual execution of each dish. It's another of the more popular entries on the list, but continues to prove itself in the multiplayer arena, even against more recent games. Players work together to run a restaurant over 15 in-game days, choosing layouts, upgrading equipment, and deciding how to handle increasingly demanding customers. Every three days, you then have to choose a card that will permanently impact the game from there on--sometimes for the worse.\n\nUnlike more linear level-based cooking games, PlateUp! leans toward rogue-lite mechanics, changing things up with every full game. Decisions made early--such as kitchen layout or menu/card choices--directly affect later runs. Cooking, serving, cleaning, and managing customer flow all happen simultaneously, making teamwork essential and genuinely challenging.\n\nDiner Bros 2 asks a lot of you, so if you want a co-op cooking game with a bit of bite, this is the one for you. Alongside serving up delicious dishes, you'll have to keep enhancing your restaurant, optimizing its layout, impressing food critics, learning new recipes, hiring staff, and even dealing with sneaky customers who try to dine-n-dash. There are no gimmicks or environmental hazards, just good honest work and the potential of a thriving business driving you forward.\n\nThe game emphasizes clear task-division, meaning it's best with four friends, but can also be played alone (by hiring staff) or with two players. One player might focus on blasting through all the cooking while another handles serving and cleanup, but the most effective teams adjust roles dynamically depending on customer flow. Progression unlocks new content, encouraging players to improve efficiency and coordination over time, so you'll find plenty of replayability here, too.\n\nGalaxy Burger is a little different from many of the games on this list, as there's no frantic energy and no chaotic time limits. It's a laid-back game with no stress, where you and up to seven friends can create cosmic burgers for aliens, space creatures, and mecha cats. Different burgers require different ingredients and combinations, meaning you'll be prepping all manner of accompaniments, toppings, and side dishes to complete challenges.\n\nIf you're sick of cooking co-op games making you frustrated, stressed, or even downright angry, Galaxy Burger offers an alternative in chilled, casual cooking in which gentle creativity is rewarded. Galaxy Burger doesn’t reinvent the genre, but it adds enough thematic flair to keep teamwork feeling fresh. Plus, some of the cats are really cute.\n\nWitchtastic handles like a co-op cooking game, but throws in a witchy twist by having you and your pals brew potions instead of preparing food. Speed is the key, as you want those potions flying out of there ASAP. While there is a single-player campaign, it's a lot more fun to team up and scurry around increasingly elaborate cooking setups.\n\nIf you're a big fan of cozy games, Witchtastic might appeal with its cottagecore cauldron-in-a-forest vibes--just watch out for ghouls, wolves, and other halloween-y horrors that might distract you from your noble pursuit. Between foraging, scooting about on a broomstick, and customising your witch, there's always something to do between brewing sessions.\n\nCook Serve Delicious 3 is a lot to explain. It's a co-op cooking game set in dystopian future America where cyborgs mingle with humans--and instead of freaking out about this, you're taking your food truck on a road trip. If there is such a thing, this is basically the Dark Souls of cooking games, so if you want something that'll pose a genuine challenge to you and your friends (perhaps to knock a smug pal down a peg or two), you'll want to check the series out. It's one of those great two-player co-op games that'll reward you handsomely if you reach its incredibly high bar for challenge.\n\nSingle-player is supported in the campaign, but local co-op is where Cook Serve Delicious 3 really shines. Between rounds, you'll upgrade and customize your food truck, expand your menu, and travel across the war-torn future USA, before launching into another round of trying to cater to the hungry masses. When on-shift, you and your friends will have to coordinate almost seamlessly in an unforgiving onslaught of demanding customers. The game packs a ridiculous 387 levels, so you've got plenty of time to hone those chopping, flipping, and frying skills.\n\nLet’s Cook Together 2 is a wholesome co-op game that can be played with just about anyone, but works best with younger kids. The game rewards cooperative puzzle-solving and well-timed cooking collaboration, with kitchens designed as challenges that require players to coordinate movements, timing, and task execution to complete recipes efficiently. It's a great introduction to co-op gaming for your less-experienced kids or siblings, and offers more than 250 levels to try.\n\nFast reflexes aren't much of a consideration in Let's Cook Together 2's lower difficulty levels; you just need to be able to communicate, plan ahead, and support each other. Everything you need to serve up your dishes is scattered across a wide room, so sometimes you're going to have to throw stuff with perfect timing.\n\nShakes on a Plane centers on cooperative milkshake-making in unusual environments, but we'll loosely group milkshakes into cooking for now. Players work together to fulfill orders while dealing with airplane kitchens that move, tilt, or change unexpectedly, as they gain altitude and deal with turbulence, demanding passengers, and even aliens.\n\nThe game thrives on shared chaos, and although it does offer single-player, we personally think it's not the best way to play it. Having multiple players support you in co-op makes it easier and more engaging, allowing you to progress at a comfortable pace. At its heart it's a fairly cluttered Overcooked clone, but the unique concept and fun setting make it a good alternative party game if you're not afraid of heights.\n\nBone’s Cafe combines cooperative cooking with a creepy-cute aesthetic, tasking players with running a cafe filled with undead workers and patrons. Players work together to preparing dishes, serving customers, and managing shared responsibilities--as well as literally raising the dead.\n\nCoordination and timing are hugely important, with progression introducing new recipes and challenges that require better teamwork. Decorate and upgrade your cafe, and increase your Skull Ranking for better rewards, all while trying to automate and streamline your work. The cute pixel art belies the fact that your job is to strategically attract, kill, and harvest customers for fresh ingredients and use their souls to raise an undead army. Adorable.",

Only one player needs a copy of the game, as everyone else can join using their mobile devices as their controller.\n\nPeak was one of our absolute favourite games of 2025, rising above the \"friendslop\" allegations and offering something genuinely interesting and varied in nature. It's a smartly simple game, allowing players to create their own solutions to the main challenge-- climbing a mountain--as well as the smaller challenges that goal throws your way. You could get slowed down by any number of environmental and weather-related hazards, relying on your friends and wits to make it to the top unscathed--it's no easy feat.\n\nThe procedurally generated mountain changes each day, so your judgments can sometimes land you in hot water and sometimes reward you with an incredible result. Work together to get to your ultimate goal or cave in and eat each other, it's up to you. We've put together a few of the best Peak mods that we think improve the experience, so even mastering the mountain doesn't need to be the end.\n\nBack in October of 2025, RV There Yet came speeding out of nowhere to become a Steam smash hit, zooming past 1.3 million sales in just one week. It seems the premise caught many peoples' eye--drive a chaotic RV around/through/over an array of obstacles and use your puzzle-solving brain to help it along if it gets stuck. Between driving and winching sessions, you'll also have to contend with dangerous wildlife. This is anything but a relaxing end to your camping holiday.\n\nBridges, ravines, bumps, and steep hills all present their own challenges, requiring you and your friends to work together to get this damn vehicle home. Once you've tumbled, scrambled, and trundled over the original terrain map, there's also a snowy winter map filled with its own unique hazards to try out.\n\nEscape The Backrooms is one of the best co-op horror games to come out of the last six months, offering both a slightly-silly dynamic and a genuinely unsettling vibe that culminates in a ridiculous, fun time with friends. There have been a number of Backrooms-themed games in recent years, but this one is your best bet for polished and well-rounded co-op fun. If you find liminal spaces inherently creepy, this one's for you.\n\nPlayers are tasked with traversing more than 30 creepy Backrooms through long corridors and suspicious facilities. All the while, a collection of horrifying entities stalk you, waiting patiently in the corner of your eyesight. It'll take a lot of communication and coordination from your friends to successfully escape when literally everything around you could be the enemy, but proximity voice chat means they're always listening....\n\nWobbly Life is an open-world physics sandbox for curious groups of comrades who want nothing more than to explore. Take on a series of jobs, complete wacky missions, and spend your hard-earned cash on items to customize your space and express yourself. The game is suitable for all ages, making it a great release to introduce kids to sandbox gaming. Once they've got a familiarity with the genre, you can move them on to some of the best sandbox games from our comprehensive list.\n\nRather surprisingly, the rights to Wobby Life have been secured by Prime Universe Films, meaning the game could become one of more than 50 games currently being adapted for film or TV. Prime Universe Films have previously adapted Hitman into a series of movies, so who knows where this could end up.\n\nRepublic of Jungle is for all those social deduction fans out there looking for games like Among Us or The Wolf Among Us. If you and your friends enjoy a bit of sneaky deception, or if you're confident you know each other well enough to pull the wool over their eyes, Republic of Jungle is a stylish, compact, and free-to-play game that allows you to do just that. It's great for larger groups of friends and people who enjoy quick-fire party games with a heavy dose of bluffing. Between Loyalists and Leakers, it might cause some rifts.\n\nThe game asks you all to play as advisers to the president, whose re-election depends on you keeping his secrets and committing to his campaign. A few of you will be designated as Leakers, subtly undermining him and passing privileged information to the press. It's up to the Loyalists to weed out the Leakers and secure a campaign victory.\n\nSync or Sink is still in Steam Early Access, but we're confident recommending it as a short but enjoyable two-player experience. It's also free, so you've got nothing to lose. Both players are trapped on an old Cold War submarine, but separated by distance. You can't see each other, but you can use your walkie-talkies to communicate. The only catch is, these function like real walkie-talkies, so you can't speak over each other, and coordination is everything.\n\nYou'll need to keep the ship running if you want to stay alive, doing urgent repairs, managing your resources, and keeping each other safe in an increasingly hazardous environment. You really, really want to team up with someone you're sure you can trust.\n\nSonic Racing: CrossWorlds is a bright, colorful, chaotic good time in which you and your pals can race each other at breakneck speed, gathering gadgets and powerups as you go. All your favourite characters are here, like Tails, Knuckles, Shadow, Amy Rose, Eggman, and--of course--Sonic, but there are also some unexpected Sega figureheads among the racers, including Persona 5's Joker, SpongeBob, and even Pac-Man. You can see the full list on our guide to Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds characters.\n\nThe game includes 24 tracks and 15 CrossWorlds, where characters from various franchises collide (quite literally). You can use local split-screen or online play to work together as a team or compete against other drivers from across the world. If you've got a geographically scattered friendship group, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds might be a good shout, as up to 12 of you can join at once online.\n\nGameSpot and Fanatical are owned by Fandom\n\nMars First Logistics came out of Early Access back in September 2025, and it didn't disappoint. The game looks fantastic and handles like a dream, presenting you with a big open world in which you can largely do just about anything you set your mind to.\n\nYour task is to help Martians complete their various building projects by moving cargo from A to B. You'll do this with up to three friends, building transport vehicles and overcoming the challenges of strange shapes, fragile items, and unpredictable gravity. Vehicles can be assembled from over 100 different parts in almost any configuration, so the sky is quite literally the limit.\n\nWe gave Absolum a 9/10 in our review, praising its excellent fusion of beat-'em-up and roguelike elements, as well as its tight, rewarding combat mechanics. The game's gorgeous and fully-realised setting only serves to further the immersion in its branching paths and many sidequests, letting you explore at your own pace. There's a lot to love about this October 2025 sleeper hit, which offers a new challenge every time you play.\n\nBut Absolum is even better with friends, supporting couch and online co-op with another player. Elemental combat powers can be combined between the two of you, and timing is key, as you'll both be able to chain attacks into a spectacular blow if you hit things just right. Absolum is definitely one of the best roguelikes to come out of 2025.\n\nGrounded 2 is one of the best Xbox-exclusives we had in 2025, but also a great and fully-fleshed out multiplayer co-op experience for up to four friends. It's still in development, but can be played through Game Pass while the bugs (hehe) get ironed out.\n\nWith player characters shrunk down to the size of ants, even the smallest critter can pose a giant threat as you and your pals wield home-made weapons and rely on stealth, cunning, and teamwork to make it through alive. Don't forget to check out our Grounded 2 guides if you need a push in the right direction.",

    "description": "Don't buy into the narrative that Roth conversions are the best option for every retiree.",
    "fullText": "Required minimum distributions or RMDs are usually framed as a financial disaster. A ticking time bomb that should be avoided.\n\nIn contrast, Roth conversions tend to be presented as an unambiguously savvy move. Pay taxes today, convert to a Roth IRA and watch your money grow tax-free.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

Should I panic? Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nThis is a tidy but incomplete narrative.\n\nRoth conversions may be a good fit for many Americans saving for retirement, but for a sizable minority, RMDs might make some sense.\n\nThe difference is more about psychology and behavior than tax math.\n\nHere’s a closer look at why RMDs get such a bad rap and why, for some retirees, it could be preferable.\n\nAt age 73, most investors are subject to minimum withdrawals from their pre-tax retirement accounts such as 401(k) plans and traditional IRAs, per Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules [1].\n\nFor control-oriented retirees, the notion of the government dictating when and how much you can tap into your nest egg is deeply unappealing.\n\nThat lack of flexibility is enough to push them to Roth conversions instead.\n\nHowever, by 73, most retirees are halfway through their retirement. At this age, they qualify for Medicare and Social Security.\n\nThey’ve also depleted some of their nest egg and likely have a better sense of how to manage their retirement budget in the most efficient way.\n\nFor some, the prospect of RMDs isn’t a financial disaster. In fact, under specific circumstances, it could offer some psychological relief.\n\nFor some retirees, RMDs force them to unlock money they would otherwise have been reluctant to use.\n\nRoughly half (46%) of all retirees said spending their own money creates a sense of anxiety, according to the Alliance for Lifetime Income’s 2024 Protected Retirement Income and Planning (PRIP) Study (2).\n\nNearly 41% said they don’t know how to stage withdrawals from their various retirement accounts. About 49% said they don’t know how to manage RMDs.\n\nDeeply ingrained spending and saving habits can be difficult to break in your 70s. For these retirees, RMDs can be a forcing mechanism to finally enjoy the fruits of their labor.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING/SHANGHAI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Tesla is poised to be one of the first automakers to benefit from Canada's move to remove 100% tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, thanks to its early efforts to ship cars from its Shanghai plant there and its established ​Canadian sales network, experts say.\n\nUnder the deal announced last Friday, Canada will allow up to 49,000 vehicles to be imported annually ‌from China with a tariff of 6.1% on most-favoured nation terms. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the quota could rise to reach 70,000 vehicles within five years.\n\nHowever, under one clause ‌in the agreement, half of the quota will be reserved for vehicles under 35,000 CAD ($25,189). Tesla model prices are all above that number.\n\nWhile many Chinese automakers will be keen to seize the opportunity as they expand exports, Tesla has an advantage as it in 2023 already equipped its Shanghai plant, its biggest and most cost-efficient factory globally, to build and export a Canada-specific version of its Model Y.\n\nThe U.S. automaker had that same year started shipping the car ⁠from Shanghai to Canada, boosting Canadian imports of automobiles ‌from China to its largest port, Vancouver, by 460% year over year to 44,356 in 2023.\n\nBut it was forced to stop in 2024 and switched to shipping from its U.S. and Berlin factories after Ottawa imposed 100% tariffs, citing ‍a wish to counter what they called China's intentional state-directed policy of overcapacity.\n\nNow, it ships Model Ys produced in Berlin to Canada, but more variants such as cheaper Model 3s are mostly built in China.\n\n\"This new agreement could allow resumption of those exports rather quickly,\" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of research firm AutoForecast Solutions.\n\nTesla ​has an existing network of 39 stores in Canada, whereas Chinese rivals such as BYD and Nio do not yet have a sales presence ‌there, and it can also likely move faster with marketing plans as it only has four core models, far fewer than its Chinese competitors.\n\n\"Tesla indeed has an advantage with its offering of a few models, versions and simple production lines so that it can be flexible to sell cars produced in any country in any markets to achieve the best cost efficiency,\" said Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.\n\nOther brands that exported cars made in China to Canada before the tariffs included Volvo and Polestar, which are both ⁠owned by China's automaking group Geely.",

    "description": "Where did it all go?",
    "fullText": "Mars is absolutely dripping with evidence that the red planet was once a striking blue, complete with glistening lakes, snaking rivers, and vast oceans. Now, scientists have calculated the 'sea level' during the wettest time known in Martian history.\n\nExamining data from three satellites, scientists in Italy and Switzerland homed in on a canyon called Coprates Chasma – itself part of Valles Marineris, the largest canyon network in the Solar System.\n\nThere, satellite images showed fan-shaped deposits that look suspiciously like the kind of river deltas that form on our home planet when running water meets a standing body.\n\n\"Delta structures develop where rivers debouch into oceans, as we know from numerous examples on Earth,\" says Fritz Schlunegger, geomorphologist at the University of Bern in Switzerland.\n\n\"The structures that we were able to identify in the images are clearly the mouth of a river into an ocean.\"\n\nAll of the delta-like structures were found at elevations of 3,650 to 3,750 meters (11,975 to 12,300 feet) below the Martian surface reference level. That puts it at about 1,000 meters above the deepest point in Valles Marineris, and would make for a sea roughly the size of our own Arctic Ocean.\n\n\"We were able to provide evidence for the deepest and largest former ocean on Mars to date – an ocean that stretched across the northern hemisphere of the planet,\" says Ignatius Argadestya, geologist at the University of Bern.\n\nThe researchers estimate that the deposits were laid around 3 billion years ago, which would make this period \"the time with the largest availability of surface water on Mars,\" they write. Intriguingly, that's a few hundred million years later than previous estimates for the existence of a Martian ocean.\n\nWhether all this water escaped up or drained down, increasing evidence points to a lush and potentially habitable past for our currently dry, dusty neighbor. Since life appeared on Earth relatively quickly, there's a chance that Mars was also briefly home to early organisms of some kind.\n\nThe researchers suggest that these newly identified coastlines might represent some of the most promising places to search for traces of ancient extraterrestrials.\n\nThe research was published in the journal npj Space Exploration.\n\nNASA Brings Astronauts Home Early After Unprecedented Medical Issue in Space\n\nNASA Plans to Put a Nuclear Reactor on The Moon.

    "fullText": "Democratic strategist James Carville on Saturday appeared on Fox News and joined the growing swell of Republicans with his forecast of a “wipeout” of their party in this year’s midterm elections — a prediction that took “Saturday in America” host Kayleigh McEnany aback.\n\nThe discussion was largely prompted by a New York Times op-ed published Thursday by David Plouffe, a political consultant and ex-adviser to former President Barack Obama, who predicted that the Democratic Party will inevitably lose the 2028 presidential election.\n\nPolitics: Pentagon Readies 1,500 Troops For Potential Minnesota Deployment: U.S. Officials\n\nPlouffe argued that the party is “still in crisis” after President Donald Trump swept all seven swing states in the 2024 election, and that Democrats currently have “no credible path” to retake the White House after recent adjustments to the electoral college map.\n\nWhen asked about his thoughts, Carville said he isn’t too concerned about that.\n\n“David is a big-brained guy who’s looking into 2030, what happens in the 2030 census, and that’s good,” he said. “I’m looking at the 2026 elections, and frankly, it’s going to be a wipeout. The Democrats are going to pick up at a minimum 25 seats, maybe as high as 45.”\n\nCarville continued, “In all likelihood, the Democrats are going to carry the Senate, and I think we’re shaping up very well for the 2028 election. But I don’t know, 2030 is…I’m 81, that might be on the other side of my horizon, to be frank with you.”\n\nPolitics: 'It Will Be Done!!!': Trump Issues Ominous New Greenland Warning In Late-Night Rant\n\nThis surprised McEnany, who recently cast an opposite prediction about the midterms.\n\n“Yeah, so, 25 to 45 seats,” she said. “That’s a bold prediction, and you are crushing my prediction on ‘The Five,’ which was that [liberal co-host] Jessica Tarlov would have an unhappy night and Republicans would overperform — which I still believe.”\n\nMcEnany continued, “The trend lines are very good, James, when you look at inflation coming down, when you look at GDP. You think an economic revival, that I think will come, cannot demolish the trend you’re seeing?”\n\nCarville acknowledged, “Well, I guess anything is possible.”\n\nThings took a considerably more serious turn when Carville noted that Republicans might not lose a thing — as Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that “we shouldn’t even have an election” — and said Trump was clearly “hinting at the fact he’s going to try to call them off.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed Thursday that the president was “simply joking” and “speaking facetiously” when he said this, arguing to reporters that Trump simply meant, “We’re doing such a great job … maybe we should just keep rolling.”\n\nPolitics: Donald Trump Backs Primary Challenge To GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy\n\nMcEnany agreed with Carville that “the important thing” right now is to ensure they happen.\n\nWhile he inaccurately predicted that then-Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris would beat Trump in 2024, his forecast of trouble for the GOP aligns with concerns shared among current and former Fox News hosts, as well as GOP consultant Karl Rove.\n\nBen Shapiro Issues Dire Midterms Prediction For The GOP\n\nStephen Miller Says Might Makes Right In Potential U.S. Takeover Of Greenland\n\nCNN Host Picks Apart Pundit's Defense Of Walz, Frey Investigation: 'You Can't Do It'",

    "description": "Despite midterm elections in November, Wall Street expects the S&P 500 to deliver double-digit returns over the next year.",
    "fullText": "The S&P 500 has usually performs poorly during midterm election years, declining by an average 18% at some point before November.\n\nThe stock market usually performs well after midterm elections (as policy uncertainty dissipates), returning an average of 14% during the next six months.\n\nWall Street's consensus estimate puts the S&P 500 at 8,085 by January 2027, which implies more than 16% upside from its current level of 6,940.\n\n10 stocks we like better than S&P 500 Index ›\n\nThe S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), the most popular benchmark for the U.S. stock market, has delivered double-digit returns in three consecutive years. Wall Street expects the index to extend its streak in 2026, but midterm election years typically involve sharp declines.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nThe S&P 500 has consistently performed poorly during midterm election years since it was created in 1957. Here are two facts investors should know.\n\nThe S&P 500 has returned an average of 1% during midterm election years, but the index has declined by an average of 7% during those years when a new president sits in the White House.\n\nThe S&P 500 has suffered an average intra-year drawdown of 18% during midterm election years, meaning history says the index will drop 18% at some point in 2026.\n\nWhat explains that trend? Midterm elections create uncertainty, especially because the political party in power tends to lose seats in Congress. Investors are unsure where to put money because they are unsure whether the president will retain enough congressional votes to maintain the status quo. Uncertainty is poison to the stock market.\n\nHowever, policy uncertainty dissipates quickly after the midterm election results are finalized, and the stock market tends to deliver strong returns. In fact, Carson Research says the six-month period following a midterm election (i.e., November through April) is the strongest of the four-year presidential cycle. The S&P 500 has added an average of 14% in those six months.\n\nDoes that mean you should sell your stocks today and buy them back in November? Nope. Attempts to time the market often backfire. Famous fund manager Peter Lynch once said, \"Far more money has been lost by investors trying to anticipate corrections, or trying to time the market, than has been lost in corrections themselves.\"\n\nIndeed, the S&P 500 has done quite well during some midterm election years. The index's return has ranged from up 38% to down 30%, and its largest intra-year decline has ranged from 4% to 38%. Most Wall Street analysts expect 2026 to be one of the better midterm election years.",

    "fullText": "The body of one of 11 people on board a plane that crashed in eastern Indonesia was found on Sunday with the debris of the aircraft.\n\nThe Indonesia Air Transport passenger plane went missing in mid-flight on Saturday after losing contact with air traffic control in the South Sulawesi province. It had been flying from Yogyakarta, on the island of Java, to Makassar, on Sulawesi island.\n\nSearch and rescue workers found the body in a steep mountain ravine, but poor weather conditions, including fog, and harsh terrain forced them to delay its recovery until Monday.\n\nThe team also found wreckage believed to be the fuselage, tail and windows of the ATR 42-500 turboprop, according to Muhammad Arif Anwar, a local official. Other wreckage, including the plane’s engine and passenger seats, has also been found.\n\nThree government workers and eight crew members were believed to be on board the plane as part of an aerial monitoring mission for Indonesia’s ministry of marine affairs and fisheries.\n\nThe plane crashed into Mount Bulusaraung in Bantimurung-Bulusaraung National Park, which borders the city of Makassar, Mr Anwar said. The crash site is approximately 1,500km north east of Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital city.\n\nThe official added that a unit had been deployed by air to search for the 10 remaining passengers and crew.\n\nThe search mission on land and air has involved more than 1,000 people, including members of the air force, police and volunteers.\n\nThe cause of the crash remains to be determined. In a statement, IAT‍ said the aircraft had had technical problems but was declared safe before flying to Makassar.\n\nIndonesia is heavily reliant on air transport to connect the thousands of islands making up the archipelago. The country has a poor record of aviation safety, with several fatal crashes in recent years.\n\nIn 2015, all 54 people on board an ATR 42-300 died after it crashed into a mountain in the Papua region.\n\nIn September, a helicopter crash killed all eight people on board in the South Kalimantan province. Less than two weeks later, four people had died in a helicopter crash in Papua.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "U.S. Army Reserve Black Hawk pilot Chris Busby, 28, and Stephanie Kenny-Velasquez, 25, went to an Austin courthouse to get their marriage certificate on Dec. 3.",
    "fullText": "U.S. Army Reserve Black Hawk pilot Chris Busby, 28, and Stephanie Kenny-Velasquez, 25, went to an Austin courthouse to get their marriage certificate on Dec. 3.\n\nRoughly 48 hours later, Velasquez entered a Houston Immigration and Customs Enforcement office for a routine check-in and never emerged, Busby said. The uncertainty has left the newlywed questioning whether his time serving the country was worth it, he said.\n\n“Stephanie is beautiful, she is smart, she’s amazing,” he said. “If it means sacrificing myself or my career to free her, I will do it.”\n\nBusby, who enlisted in the Army Reserve in 2015, has spent the last six weeks looking for ways to free his wife from detention. Despite his years of service and their recent nuptials, Velasquez was denied bond on Jan. 9, according to her lawyer.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment. The Department of Justice declined to comment on Velasquez’s case.\n\nVelasquez came to the United States in 2021 hoping to start a new life far from the violence and political instability of her native Venezuela. She does not have a criminal record and presented herself to immigration officials in Miami when she arrived in the country.\n\nIn the meantime, Velasquez, 25, settled into life in Austin. She picked up a job at a local car wash and took classes to get her real estate license.\n\nThe couple met in March and Busby, 28, immediately knew she was the one.\n\n“I’ve never met anyone like her,” he said. “She came here and just wanted to be the best.”\n\nTheir families had no idea that the couple planned to marry, and that’s how Busby said he wanted it. Busby said he was saving up money from his glass installation business to pay for a big wedding down the line.\n\nVelasquez had an asylum case pending at the time of her detention.\n\nHer brother, Oscar, described his younger sister as ambitious and driven. She hoped to start her own company one day and diligently saved money from working at the car wash and helping Busby with his window tinting business. She was studying for her real estate exam on the car ride to her immigration check-in, her husband said, adding that the test was scheduled for the following week.\n\n“She worked so hard for everything she had,” her brother said. “She was so happy.”\n\nBut on the day his sister was scheduled to check in with immigration officials, the family remained worried that Velasquez could be swept up in President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown despite her recent marriage and pending asylum case, he said.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have fled political repression and economic crisis in recent years, arriving in the United States seeking asylum or other legal protections like temporary protected status, or TPS.\n\nTrump moved to revoke TPS for many Venezuelans, which has been in place since 2023, and from other countries as part of his agenda to restrict immigration. That has been allowed to move forward while legal challenges to the action make their way through the courts.\n\n“We left to have a better future, more opportunities. Now if we go outside, we could be stopped by ICE,” Oscar said.\n\nLike other Venezuelans who have emigrated, Oscar said returning to Venezuela right now is unthinkable following the ouster of Nicolás Maduro. The country is far too dangerous and unstable for them to return, he said.\n\nVelasquez was transferred to the Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, nearly three hours away from Austin. Since she entered detention her hair has thinned, Busby said. She sleeps fitfully in a bunk bed surrounded by 80 women, who share seven tablets to contact loved ones and lawyers, Busby said. They are allowed one visit per week and given food that is barely edible, he added.\n\nThe stress has taken a toll on Velasquez, according to her husband.\n\n“The girl is 25 years old. She should not be looking like she’s pushing 40,” Busby said.\n\nThe couple is now hoping for a Hail Mary in the form of the military’s Parole in Place program, which is intended to provide legal protections for spouses who lack U.S citizenship.\n\nBut the administration has slowly chipped away at the program, and a 2024 court ruling ended a Biden-era expansion called Keeping Families Together, which added stepchildren to the list of eligible relatives.\n\nA message on the initiative’s website said the Department of Homeland Security would no longer accept applications or adjudicate ones that were pending. The agency did not immediately respond to a request clarifying whether the Parole in Place program still applies to spouses.\n\n“I’m trying my hardest but there is so little I can do,” Busby said. “I just want her out of there.”\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "fullText": "The next stop on Donald Trump’s world tour—or takeover—may be America’s northern neighbor.\n\nThe president, 79, has turned his attention toward Canada, fixating on what he sees as vulnerabilities along its northern border that could be exploited by U.S. adversaries Russia or China, two U.S. officials, a senior administration official, and three former senior U.S. officials told NBC News.\n\n“They certainly need to up their game when it comes to Arctic capabilities,” one official told the outlet, adding that Canada’s northern border “is not acceptable given today’s threats” and that “the status quo is not enough.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly complained about what he views as Canada’s weak defenses, sparking conversations with Canadian officials about a broader Arctic security strategy, NBC reported. Among the initiatives that have caught Trump’s interest are expanded U.S. maritime patrols and the purchase of additional icebreakers—specialized ships designed to operate in ice-covered waters—operating in or around Canadian territory.\n\n“Trump is really worried about the U.S. continuing to drift in the Western Hemisphere and is focused on this,” one official told NBC.\n\nThey added: “At the end of the day, this is to stop Russia and China from having a further presence in the Arctic.”\n\nWith 3.85 million square miles and 40 million residents, Canada is the largest target on Trump’s growing list of potential land grabs.\n\nThe conversations come as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Friday, signaling an effort to deepen ties between the two countries. Carney became the first Canadian leader to visit China since 2017.\n\nTrump’s fixation on Canada, aides say, is part of a broader effort to “solidify” the Western Hemisphere—and falls in line with his aggressive campaign to acquire Greenland, the semiautonomous Danish territory.\n\n“Canada stands to benefit from the U.S. having Greenland,” one administration official said.\n\nCarney on Friday voiced support for Denmark’s NATO membership and said Greenland—home to roughly 57,000 residents and located northeast of Canada—should determine its own future.\n\nTrump’s increasingly frequent assertions that “We do need Greenland, absolutely,” for defense purposes, have rattled Denmark, whose leaders have repeatedly warned they will not give up the world’s largest island, and that an American takeover would end NATO.\n\nWhite House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller asserted on Saturday that under “the law,” nations were not entitled to their territory if they were unable to defend it. The Trump aide belittled the Danish government, saying its “tiny” military was failing to adequately protect Greenland.\n\n“With respect to Denmark, Denmark is a tiny country with a tiny economy, and a tiny military,” Miller said of Fox’s Hannity.\n\n“They cannot defend Greenland. They cannot control the territory of Greenland. Under every understanding of law that has existed about territorial control for 500 years, to control a territory you have to be able to defend a territory, improve territory, inhabit a territory. Denmark has failed on every single one of these tests.”\n\nMeanwhile, officials told NBC that the White House has voiced similar criticisms of Canada, which has increased its defense spending but continues to fall short of NATO’s goal.\n\n“The world doesn’t see Canada as a major force when it comes to defense,” the official told NBC.\n\nTrump has previously said “it’s highly unlikely” he would use military force against Canada. But after his shock invasion of Venezuela and the abduction of then-President Nicholas Maduro on Jan. 3., the president has not ruled out deploying U.S. military troops to countries including Colombia, U.S. ally Mexico, and Greenland.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House and to Carney’s representatives for comment.",

    "fullText": "If you can't beat 'em, eat 'em, right? At least, that's the growing attitude of many across the United States who have exhausted most other methods of dealing with invasive species.\n\nAccording to the National Wildlife Federation, the growing \"invasivorism\" movement is encouraging people to help restore ecological balance by eating the species that don't belong.\n\nWhen invasive plants and animals spread, they crowd out native species, damage habitats, and throw ecosystems out of sync. Traditionally, managing them has meant costly removals or chemical controls.\n\nBut chefs, scientists, and local communities are testing a different approach: creating demand for invasive species as food, so removing them becomes part of everyday life.\n\nOne of the most cited examples is the lionfish, a striking but destructive reef predator that has spread rapidly through the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. With few natural predators and an enormous appetite, lionfish can wipe out native fish populations in a matter of years.\n\nIn Florida, divers, fisheries biologists, and restaurants teamed up to turn the invader into a menu item. Events like Lionfish Restaurant Week helped show diners that ordering dinner could also support reef recovery.\n\nWould you take a gardening class if it were free?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThis approach is catching on elsewhere, too. An invasive Hawaiian fish, called the Ta'ape, is beginning to find its place on the menus of seafood restaurants. In Mississippi, locals are making a similar push for nutria, an invasive South American rodent.\n\n\"This is not Fear Factor,\" conservation biologist Joe Roman told National Wildlife magazine. \"You want something tasty.\"\n\nRoman, who runs the Eat the Invaders project, argues that food is one of the fastest ways to get people invested in protecting local ecosystems.\n\nWhile eating invasive species will not solve the problem on its own, reducing populations through what scientists call \"functional extinction\" can give native species a fighting chance.\n\nUnlike many environmental fixes, this one comes with a clear upside for everyday people: delicious new flavors, and a chance to participate in conservation without changing their entire lifestyle.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara questioned the actions of the ICE agent who shot and killed protester Renee Good earlier this month during an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday. O’Hara said the agent violated “basic steps” that officers know about approaching vehicles.\n\nCorrespondent Cecilia Vega said the shooting has become a national “Rorschach test,” where some Americans see a “senseless killing” and others see an “officer defending his life.”\n\nO’Hara said he has watched clips of the incident — and come away asking why the officer was in front of Good’s SUV right before the shooting.\n\n“It’s not clear to me why he appears to be in the path of the vehicle more than once,” O’Hara said. “When you approach someone in a vehicle in a law enforcement encounter, there are very basic steps you take to ensure the officer’s safety and de-escalate the situation.”\n\nVega then said Vice President JD Vance put the blame for the shooting “squarely” on Good the day after the attack. She also said Homeland Security officials accused Good and her partner of “stalking” immigration officers; Vega did not mention DHS shared footage last week of Good blocking traffic for three minutes with her vehicle before agents approached her.\n\nCBS News reported this week the ICE agent — Jonathan Ross — suffered internal bleeding after being struck by Good’s vehicle right before he opened fire.\n\nO’Hara told 60 Minutes he was in favor of “targeted, precise pre-planned operations on violent offenders,” which he said are a “good thing.”\n\n“But I’m concerned that people in the [Trump] administration don’t understand the reality of what is happening on the street,” he added.\n\nThe 60 Minutes crew also captured a heckler shouting at O’Hara that he was a “pig” who was enabling ICE while they he was walking-and-talking to Vega.\n\n“People have a right to say disrespectful things… however, they cannot physically obstruct law enforcement from performing a function,” O’Hara said. “Those things are illegal.”\n\nThe post Minneapolis Police Chief Questions ICE Agent Who Shot Renee Good — Tells 60 Minutes He Violated ‘Basic Steps’ of Being An Officer first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "PARIS/OSLO, Jan 19 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump in a written message to Norway's prime minister said he no longer feels obligated \"to think purely of Peace\" because he ​had not been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and he repeated his demand for control of Greenland.\n\nThe ‌note, shared widely with other nations by the U.S. administration, was in response to a brief message to Trump from Norway's Prime Minister Jonas ‌Gahr Stoere and Finnish President Alexander Stubb opposing his decision to impose tariffs on European allies over their refusal to let the U.S. take control of Greenland, Stoere said in a statement.\n\nIn their message, Stoere and Stubb pointed to the need to de-escalate the rhetoric and requested a phone call with Trump, the Norwegian premier's statement said. Trump's response came only a ⁠short time after they had sent their ‌message.\n\nTRUMP SAYS HE'LL FOCUS ON WHAT'S RIGHT FOR U.S.\n\n\"Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer ‍feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,\" Trump wrote in his response, which was seen by Reuters.\n\nTrump has openly campaigned for ​the Nobel Peace Prize, which last year was awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.\n\n\"I have several times ‌explained clearly to Trump the well-known fact that it is an independent Nobel Committee, and not the Norwegian government, which awards the prize,\" Stoere said.\n\nMachado gave Trump her gold medal during a White House meeting last week, though the Norwegian Nobel Committee has said the prize cannot be transferred, shared or revoked.\n\nThe Nobel Committee did not immediately reply on Monday to a request for comment.\n\nIn his message to Stoere, Trump also again questioned Danish sovereignty over Greenland, saying: \"Denmark cannot ⁠protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they ​have a 'right of ownership' anyway?\"\n\n\"There are no written documents, it's only that ​a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also.\"\n\nDanish sovereignty over the vast, mineral-rich island is documented in a series of binding legal instruments including a ‍treaty agreed in 1814. The ⁠U.S. has repeatedly recognised that Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\nTrump concluded his message to Stoere with typical ebullience.\n\n\"I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO ⁠should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President ‌DJT.\"",

    "description": "It was an ugly, brutal playoff win, but the Rams found a way. A defense that refused to break. From a team who cut their kicker, then called one to save their season.",
    "fullText": "CHICAGO — He emerged from the tunnel into a swirling, frozen gloom, with the whisper of an NFC Championship game wrapped in a wool hat.\n\nThe score was tied 10-10. His offense, listless. The grip on the season was as numb as the wet fingers frozen from heavy snow.\n\nSean McVay looked at his players, their breath clouding the frigid air, and delivered a three-word sermon that would become a prophecy, a plea, and a lifeline.\n\nWhat followed was 90 minutes of playoff football distilled to its raw, brutal essence. The Los Angeles Rams' 20-17 overtime victory over the Chicago Bears is a continued quest for redemption after their season ended a year ago in the Divisional Round.\n\nIn a contest where the Los Angeles Rams' most maligned units became their saviors, where their brilliant quarterback battled his own form, and where their meticulous coach nearly cost them everything.\n\nWhen the final, arcing kick from Harrison \"The Thiccer Kicker\" Mevis sliced through the gray haze and between the uprights, it was more than a game-winner.\n\nAll year, the Rams' special teams had been in disarray, a festering wound.\n\nKicks were blocked. Field goals sailed wide.\n\nThey fired their coordinator. They released a long snapper. They cut our kicker.\n\nThe move to Mevis was a desperate Hail Mary.\n\nAnd in this frozen hell, their kicker became a Godsend.\n\nHis 42-yard winner was an act of supreme pressure, a redemption arc written in ice.\n\n\"I felt really confident,\" McVay said. \"The weather had calmed down… I was very confident he would make that.\"\n\nThe operation—snap, hold, kick—was flawless in conditions designed for failure.\n\nIf special teams provided the final punctuation, the Rams' secondary authored the game's most defiant stanzas.\n\nA perceived weakness became an unyielding fortress.\n\nCobie Durant set the tone early, picking off Caleb Williams on the goal line. Kam Curl was a force, a sure-tackling missile whose night crescendoed with the play of the season: a leaping, game-sealing interception of Williams in overtime.\n\nIn a mix of awe and absolution, McVay exhaled, \"What a freaking play by Cam Curl,\" McVay said.\n\nThey played with a collective amnesia for their reputation, attacking the ball, confusing a young quarterback, and proving that heart can be a scheme.\n\n\"Our defense was outstanding,\" McVay said. \"They carried us tonight.\"\n\nThey had to because the offense and its architect stumbled.\n\nMatthew Stafford, the likely MVP, 1-9 in cold, rainy and frigid games since joining the Rams, fought the elements and a vicious Bears defense to a 20-of-42, 258-yard stalemate.\n\nHe was sacked four times. His rhythm, absent. Yet, when absolute clarity was demanded, he was crystalline. He found Puka Nacua, who was limited to 5 catches and 56 yards, for a critical third-down conversion in OT.\n\nHe dropped a dime to Davante Adams on the sideline—a throw Adams called \"a pinky-to-pinky catch\"—that required video review to believe.\n\n\"I tried to put it to a spot… he's as long as it gets at corner,\" Stafford said. \"What a hell of a catch.\"\n\nBut Stafford's path was nearly blocked by his own coach.\n\nWith a chance to ice the game late in the fourth, leading 17-10, McVay faced a critical third-and-1. Opposed to throwing for the first, McVay played it safe and opted to run the ball with Kyren Williams.\n\nThe play was stuffed. The ensuing Ethan Evans punt was shanked.\n\nBears quarterback Caleb Williams then authored his own miracle, a 51-yard heave to Cole Kmet for a touchdown with 18 seconds left.\n\nMcVay didn't hide from the error.\n\n\"I make a terrible third down and one call. No excuse for that. Should have used the timeout… I can be better for our group. I will be better,\" McVay said.\n\nHis honesty was as stark as the Chicago cold.\n\nYet, the Rams found a way. They always do.\n\nStafford, the grizzled gunslinger, is now one game away from contending for his second Super Bowl.\n\nThe only thing standing in his way—the Seattle Seahawks. A division rival. A house of horrors. The site of a brutal collapse just a month ago.\n\n\"It's a huge challenge to go play in Seattle,\" Stafford said. \"We've done it once this year, and what a hell of a game that was… I'm sure excited to be in this opportunity.\"\n\nIn the visitor's locker room, soaked in sweat and satisfaction, McVay's halftime command echoed.\n\nHis team found a way not by being perfect, but by being persistent.\n\nNot with an award-winning performance, but with a defiant, collective scream into the blizzard.\n\nThe special teams are reborn. The secondary, redeemed. The quarterback, resilient. The kicker, clutch.\n\nThey survived themselves. They survived the cold. They survived chaos.\n\nNow, they head north, with one more mountain to climb, the echoes of a simple command now their battle cry: Find a way.",

    "fullText": "SYDNEY, N.S. — American netminder Bianca Birittieri made an incredible 38 saves, while linemates Emily Pohl and Lindsay Stepnowski scored in the first and second, to help lead the United States to a 2-0 gold medal victory Sunday night at U18 Women's Worlds in Nova Scotia — and not just any gold medal world championship win at that.\n\nThe Americans reclaimed gold medal bragging rights, marking their 10th title at the IIHF Under-18 Women's World Championship, and did so on Canadian ice, in front of a sold-out crowd of more than 5,000 fans at Centre 200 in Cape Breton Island.\n\nNot only did they fight against a sea of red and white spectators and a strong, skilled Canadian squad, but according to the International Ice Hockey Federation, this American contingent is the first national under-18 team to ever win \"perfect gold\" at U18 Women's Worlds, which means the stripes and stars squad never trailed an opponent and were never tied throughout the entire week-and-a-half-long international tournament.\n\nThis was a history-making world championship.\n\nThe U.S. coaching staff told its team to \"do the same thing we've been doing,\" Pohl said to media of the stick-to-habits message she and her teammates followed throughout the tournament, since it proved so successful, and ultimately \"perfect\" in the IIHF stats.\n\n\"Obviously, I think we did it well,\" Pohl said, a big smile on her face and a gold medal wrapped around her neck, teammates Taila Hansen and Birittieri at her side.\n\n\"We just played fast, re-loaded(ed) pucks and just worked our hearts out,\" added Hansen, whose smile matched her teammates and message echoed what head coach Courtney Kennedy told media after the game.\n\n\"They've been training and buying in every day, all the time,\" said Kennedy, whose lineage hails from Glace Bay on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, slight tears forming in her eyes as she spoke of her late grandmother and family from the host province for the world championship.\n\n\"We were kind of hard on them in terms of trying to understand the system,\" Kennedy said. \"It's not a crazy system — it's literally play from your heart and play for each other, and they chose to do that, and... watching them today, they chose time and time again to play the right way.\"\n\nBut truth be told, while earlier tournament games featured large gaps between teams, in particular between the top two North American squads and their opponents, this gold medal game could have gone either way, with one single play able to make the difference at any time. As women's hockey followers know, this is par for the course between the long-time rivals.\n\nAs for starting Birittieri in the crease Sunday, \"there were saves she made that just stole the momentum... and you can just take the wind out of the sails of a team, and you need that, \" Kennedy said of why she picked her for the gold medal game.\n\n\"There's one save, one save in a game that can almost put the nail in the coffin, and she made that one save; I want to say it was on Milani on that left side, I was like, 'wow,' and you could just feel it,\" Kennedy said.\n\n\"Because that Canada team is incredibly talented and they did nothing but play their hearts out, too,\" she said.\n\nAs for Brittieri, \"it's always an hounour to wear the jersey, and to get the chance to play in the gold medal game and get the win is just incredible,\" the humbl goalie told reporters, flanked by Hansen, Pohl and their gold medals.\n\nBoth sides of the border stepped onto the ice Sunday night prepared, but Pohl's goal came early at 14:08 in the first on an assist from Hansen, and that set an intense but winning pace for the United States.\n\n\"She executed it perfectly; I just had to tap it in,\" Pohl said of the opening the scoring with help from her linemate.\n\n\"I was going up to the dot and was like what are we going to do,\" Hansen said of her assist. \"I was going to (put it back)... but then I was like, 'no, go forward,' and it worked out.\"\n\nHansen also helped out on Stepnowski's goal at 18:17 in the second period to seal the deal for the Americans, who were able to hold Canada's determined offence at bay through the remainder of the game despite the red and white crashing the net, pulling netminder Lea-Rose Charrois for 11 seconds late in the third in an attempt to create a scoring chance, and a much-needed timeout to strategize a potential late-game comeback — which is always possible when Canada and the United States face off.\n\nFor her part, Lea-Rose Charrois made 25 saves to help keep Canada in the game.\n\n\"We started really strong,\" Canadian head coach Vicky Sunohara said in the mixed zone. \"The skating, puck in deep, the forechecking. I thought we had opportunities, but we didn't bury the puck ,and there were times when we shot when we didn't have anybody driving the net, and gave their goalie confidence; didn't really challenge her.\n\n\"I think for the most part, though, you get one in and it could change the momentum,\" Sunohara agreed with a single play potentially changing the game.\n\n\"I thought we gave it everything we had; they're a very good team and they worked hard for 60 minutes, so I'm not taking anything away from them.\"\n\n\"I think as a group we did reallly well,\" agreed Canadian captain Hayley McDonald, a silver medal around her neck despite a tear-stained face.\n\n\"It's truly an honour to play not just for your country, but on home turf, and having this game sold out is amazing,\" she said.\n\nBut Canada's best efforts couldn't stop the U.S. from its \"perfect gold\" at the 2026 rematch of U18 worlds past.\n\nThe IIHF also handed out its individual awards after Sunday's gold medal game, with 16-year-old American forward Jane Daley of Medfield, Mass., winning most valuable player for her 12 goals and oustanding offence on behalf of the world champions.\n\nLeading the All-Star Team, which was voted on by accredited media attending the event, she was joined by American captain and defender Margaret Averill, along with Canadian forwards Adrianna Milani and Sofia Ismael, as well as red and white blueliner Megan Mossey.\n\nTop goalie honours went to Switzerland's Norina Schrupowski, who made 149 saves on a whopping 159 shots to post an impressive 93.71 save percentage over 227 minutes between the crease, according to IIHF official stats.\n\nThe IIHF Directorate also handed out awards, including Best Goalkeeper to Schrupowski, Best Defender to Averill and Best Forward to Daley.\n\n\"USA Hockey has a really high standard and they recruit the best players,\" Hansen said of the philopshy behind the American road to gold, which could set the standard for what happens on the ice at the 2026 Olympic Winter Games in Milano, Italy.\n\n\"The coaches, the staff, everyone,\" she said. \"I think just buying into what they say and doing it for each other, they really preach that, doing it for the teammate next to you, holding that rope for them... that kind of sets the standard, and everyone knows that at all levels.\"",

    "title": "Williams: Why Marty Brennaman has big interest in national title game",
    "description": "Williams: Luke Brennaman is all in on being a Brennaman. And Marty and Thom are all in on the Indiana University junior's broadcasting aspirations.",
    "fullText": "You have a lot of melodrama in you, Luke. This is a (bleeping) baseball game, not World War III.\n\nYou rose to the occasion, Luke. You were really close to perfection. So happy for you.\n\nJust a sampling of the daily text messages that aspiring play-by-play man Luke Brennaman receives from his baseball hall-of-fame broadcasting grandfather, who even Luke affectionately calls Marty. The texts are equal parts educational, entertaining, critical and complimentary – and 100 percent Marty Brennaman.\n\nLuke Brennaman has gone all in on being a Brennaman. And so Marty and Luke’s dad, broadcaster Thom Brennaman, have gone all in on helping the third member of their family try to reach his goal of becoming a big-league broadcaster someday.\n\nThat journey continues Monday night in Miami, where 20-year-old Luke will call the national championship game between the Indiana Hoosiers and Miami Hurricanes for IU’s student radio station. Luke, a Mariemont High graduate, is a junior in IU's broadcasting program. He is the student radio station's co-sports director and also does work for the student television station.\n\nMarty and Thom will be intently tuned into WIUX-FM 99.1, excited to hear the next step in Luke's journey to potentially making the Brennamans just the second family to have at least three generations of big-league baseball broadcasters. The family of Chicago Cubs legend Harry Caray has had four generations of major-league broadcasters.\n\nThe national championship game will be a broadcasting milestone for the Brennamans. Luke will do what his father once did for Fox back in the BCS days and call a national championship game. No other father and son have broadcast a national college football championship game, Thom believes. Thom, who now calls college games for the CW Network and hosts the morning drive talk show on 700 WLW, called three BCS title games.\n\nLet's go ahead and get this out of the way: Luke isn't counting on the family name to get him to the big leagues. His biggest champions are also his biggest critics, starting with Marty, who also pulls no punches with his grandson.\n\n\"Maybe down the road the last name will make a difference,\" Marty told me in an interview last summer. \"But I told Luke, ‘Don’t think that’s going to allow you to skate into a situation. It boils down to what kind of talent you got.’ \"\n\nMarty continued: \"He has a great passion for being good. He’s very professional. He works at it. He has talent.\"\n\nMarty constantly texts Luke during IU football broadcasts, even calls him at halftime or immediately after the broadcast to give feedback. The \"you rose to the occasion\" text came right after Luke finished calling Indiana's Rose Bowl win against Alabama.\n\n\"You get that text, and it’s like, ‘Wow, this is livin’ right here,’ ” Luke said.\n\nLuke is confident like Marty and Thom. Thom worries about Luke staying humble. Marty's texts help take care of that.\n\nMarty invented brutal honesty in broadcasting during his 46 years calling Cincinnati Reds games on radio, and those texts weren't always so glowing last summer. Luke had landed an unpaid job calling games in the Cape Cod Baseball League, a collegiate wooden-bat summer league. It's not just for college baseball players, but also aspiring broadcasters.\n\nWhen Luke landed the job, which typically goes to college seniors, he realized big-time broadcasting could actually be in his future. Marty and Thom realized it, too, and changed their approach. They've never pushed Luke to pursue broadcasting, but the Cape Cod League job made Marty and Thom have serious conversations with Luke about what it really takes.\n\n\"They were always, 'Do as much as you can, but figure out if you like it,' \" Luke said. \"Early in my sophomore year, I decided I really like this, but wondered when am I going to get good at it? They did such a good job of guiding me and letting me figure it out on my own.\"\n\nLuke added: \"The feedback was always, ‘You did great.’ Then I got the Cape Cod League job. The critique went from 'we're glad you're doing it' to Marty saying: 'What the (bleep) does \"on the bump mean\"? Never say that again.' \"\n\nLuke came home from IU after spring semester for three weeks before heading off to New England to call 44 games in 55 days for the Harwich Mariners. Those three weeks were better than any college course.\n\n\"My dad told me, 'If you’re going to call baseball, you have to know baseball. Do you know how the infield fly works? Well, you better or else you’re going to get eaten alive.’ He said, 'You’re not ready.' He was feeling the magnitude of this. I bought a book called 'The Baseball Thesaurus' and I bought in.\"\n\nLuke and Thom started calling games in the family's Terrace Park living room each night. Luke had to be there at 6 p.m. They'd turn on random games on MLB's television package, mute the TV, call the game radio style and \"annoy the hell out of my mom,\" Luke said. Luke was play-by-play. Thom was color analyst. If the game went to commercial, they'd click to a different game and keep going.\n\n\"I got addicted to it,\" Luke said. \"We'd call four straight innings and get dinner. Then I'd tell my dad, 'Come on, give me three more innings.' \"\n\nThey took the show on the road to Great American Ball Park. Thom, the former long-time TV play-by-play voice of the Reds, arranged with the team to use an empty TV/radio booth for him and Luke to do a practice broadcast. They called two Reds games from the ballpark and recorded them.\n\nLuke learned nuances, such as referring to a pitch count by saying \"2-and-1\" rather than \"2 balls and 1 strike\" – little things to make the broadcast more concise.\n\nLuke believes he wouldn't have made it through the summer without those sessions with dad. Marty and Thom listened to all of Luke's Cape Cod broadcasts. Marty and his wife, Amanda, visited Luke in New England.\n\nOne of Marty's big lessons is not getting overly excited about meaningless plays early in a game. That's where the \"World War III\" text came in, when Marty heard Luke get too excited about an inconsequential walk. Marty was as tough on Luke as he was on some of those Reds players and managers.\n\n\"I called my dad and said, 'If Marty keeps telling me not to say stuff, I may have to go on the air and not speak,' \" Luke said, laughing.\n\nLuke doesn't necessarily look to emulate Marty or Thom on air. He's studied his dad much more than he has Marty. Growing up, it was only natural to watch the Reds on TV in the living room and not listen much on the radio. Luke loves his dad's style, and several times a week goes on YouTube and rewatches clips from Thom's days calling the NFL and college football for Fox and Reds games.\n\nLuke also makes sure to watch his dad call ACC football and basketball games on The CW.\n\n\"I’ve loved my dad’s ability to be a critical of a manager,\" Luke said. \"He’s only able to do that because he knows the game so well. The one thing I’ve taken from both my dad and Marty: I love how they were both so confident in everything they said on the air. That is something my dad ingrained me.\"\n\nContact columnist Jason Williams at jwilliams@enquirer.com\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Marty Brennaman's texts inspire grandson at Indiana University",

    "fullText": "Bears QB Caleb Williams leaves NFL fans speechless with viral USC Houdini-like TD vs. Rams originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Chicago Bears' 2025-26 NFL postseason run came to a close Sunday night from a chilly Soldier Field, as the Los Angeles Rams took advantage of a Caleb Williams interception in a 17-17 overtime period that led to the Rams' eventual game-winning 42-yard field goal from kicker Harrison Mevis to send them to the NFC Championship next Sunday vs. the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe game never reaches the extra session, however, without Williams' late-game heroics. The Bears put together one last drive late in the fourth quarter, needing to convert a fourth-and-4 to keep the season afloat. Twenty-seven seconds remained in regulation, as Williams went to work.\n\nWilliams avoided pressure, scrambling to find tight end Cole Kmet in the back left corner of the end zone to keep the season alive for a bit longer.\n\nThe pass, reminiscent of those that led Williams' Bears to victories against the Packers in Week 16 and the NFC Wildcard Playoffs, has gone viral again.\n\nAnd again, a moment Chicago fans won't forget has to be seen to be believed for those who have not.\n\nMore: Is Fernando Mendoza the model QB?

Between the growth, the hard times, the good times, and just being able to be in the locker room with the guys that we had and the guys that are gonna be here [next year]. So, I'm excited.

    "fullText": "The Michael Carrick era began in glorious fashion, as Manchester United overpowered noisy neighbours Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday.\n\nWhat the new caretaker head coach got spot on was his tactics and his utilisation of the squad. For far too long under Ruben Amorim, round pegs have been shoved into square holes.\n\nBut not the legendary midfielder. He played players in their natural positions, as seen from Bruno Fernandes occupying the No.10 position behind the striker and playing a free role like he used to under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.\n\nThe Portuguese was at the centre of everything good, and also picked up an assist for the first goal scored by Bryan Mbeumo.\n\nDespite the stunning return to form, the club captain is reportedly open to leaving in the summer, having grown disillusioned with the owners and the project.\n\nINEOS were said to be open to his departure last summer as well, and there is plenty of interest from both within Europe and the Saudi Pro League.\n\nBut if the Portugal international leaves, the Red Devils will need an incredible signing to offset the loss. And as per SportsBoom, the Red Devils feel Morgan Gibbs-White would be the perfect attacking signing.\n\nThe 20-time English league champions were even ready to invest in January, but given Nottingham Forest’s precarious league form, they will not sell their talisman this month.\n\nBut they are fully aware that United will return in the summer, and they will find competition in the form of Chelsea.\n\nForest are likely to demand a staggering €80-85 million for the England international, whether they receive such a high fee remains to be seen.\n\n25/26 season stats via Transfermarkt\n\n“Nottingham Forest are standing firm over the future of their star midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White. The club hierarchy has made it clear that the player is not for sale in the January transfer window, despite persistent interest from Premier League giants Manchester United and Chelsea.\n\n“However, fresh updates from sources close to the situation suggest that Manchester United and Chelsea have been tracking the playmaker for a long time. Both clubs are expected to renew their efforts in the summer window.\n\n“Manchester United are reportedly in the market for a creative spark in the final third, while Chelsea’s strategy of building a young, dynamic squad keeps Morgan Gibbs-White high on their shortlist.\n\n“From a financial perspective, if a move eventually materialises, the valuation is expected to reach a staggering €80-85 million.”\n\nThe 25-year-old already has six goals and three assists to his name despite Forest’s struggles, while last season, he registered seven goals and 10 assists.\n\nMorgan Gibbs-White could prove an astute signing, but not for the price being quoted. He is not the only Forest player on the club’s radar with INEOS likely to go after Elliot Anderson to solve their midfield woes.\n\nFeature image Clive Brunskill via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Despite leaving Liverpool as one of the most highly regarded coaches in world football in 2024, Jurgen Klopp said he never thought of himself as amongst the game's best.\n\n\"I never considered myself a world-class coach,\" Klopp told AFP and other media in an interview in Leipzig, \"because I still had so many questions when I finished.\"\n\n\"I was like 'how can I be world-class with these questions still?'\"\n\nAfter starting out at Mainz, where he took the club to the top flight for the first time, Klopp moved to Borussia Dortmund, where he won two Bundesliga titles and reached the 2013 Champions League final.\n\nAfter signing with Liverpool in 2015, Klopp's Reds won every trophy on offer, including the Champions League and Premier League.\n\nIn his new role as Red Bull's global head of football, where he oversees a multi-club structure with teams including RB Leipzig, New York Red Bulls and Paris FC, Klopp said that he wants to help coaches answer those questions.\n\n\"My role with the coaches is to be the guy I never had. I sat in my office very, very, very often, very, very, very alone.\n\n\"A lot of people gave me advice and have great ideas... It's great to have ideas, but it's really not that easy to make the final decision.\n\n\"I want to be in moments when I know they are alone, or feel alone. I want to be there.\"\n\nKlopp oversaw the firing of then-Leipzig coach Marco Rose, a long-time friend, in 2025 and said that being on the other side felt odd.\n\n\"Grave-digger of the coaches -- that's a title I never wanted to win!\"\n\n- 'I never watch the goals back' -\n\nFrom taking Mainz to the Bundesliga to breaking Liverpool's Premier League drought, Klopp improved clubs and players wherever he went.\n\nOften taking over with teams at a low ebb, the coach would try and put things in perspective.\n\n\"How did I start a game? I would say 'the worst news is you can lose it' -- so let's try and win it... Do not try to avoid defeat -- try to win.\"\n\nThe coach said he told his players: \"Giving your all doesn't mean you will get anything, but it's your only chance to get something. That's pretty much how you do it.\n\n\"We gave everything -- and sometimes we got something.\"\n\nKlopp said that media and fans were too focused on results.\n\n\"I never watch the goals back, because I want to understand the game to the left and the right of the result.\n\n\"I want to understand why it happened... Results are the result of the performance. So we worked on the performance and the results came later.\"\n\nThe 58-year-old said that he \"didn't take any pride\" out of trophy ceremonies and parades.\n\n\"I love being a part of it, not in the middle of it.

He has a god-given talent which everyone knows from his coaching jobs.\n\n\"He can catch people in five to 10 minutes.\"\n\nSchaefer said that Klopp plays an important role in player recruitment by \"talking to families, talking to players about our vision, about our project.\n\n\"You know if Jurgen Klopp is in the room.\"\n\nSince stepping down at Anfield, Klopp has been linked to an array of high-profile coaching jobs, but said that a return to the dugout is unlikely.\n\n\"I don't expect to change my mind, but I don't know.\n\n\"We're building a house right now and my missus wanted to have a really big trophy room.

    "fullText": "It already seems clear Real Madrid coach Alvaro Arbeloa believes success with the record 15-time European champions will only come with the careful management of egos at the club.\n\nLos Blancos host Monaco on Tuesday in the Champions League as they bid to consolidate their position in the top eight of the league phase and put a turbulent spell behind them.\n\nThe Spanish Super Cup defeat by Barcelona in Xabi Alonso's last game at the helm and Arbeloa's debut Copa del Rey humiliation shook the club, with fans exhibiting their feelings on Saturday as they whistled their own players.\n\nMadrid beat Levante 2-0 in La Liga but there was an immense show of dissent, with Arbeloa and star players Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham notably in the firing line.\n\nArbeloa's predecessor Alonso's downfall started when, despite beating Barcelona in the Clasico in October, he substituted Vinicius and the Brazilian responded furiously.\n\nAlonso also upset Fede Valverde by playing him at out of position and rotated Jude Bellingham, until eventually the pressure on him from within the dressing room told.\n\nThe Basque coach returned Vinicius and Bellingham to their near-untouchable star status, results did not follow and eventually Alonso was forced out.\n\nArbeloa's approach seems to be to lavish the club's most talented players with the kind of affection shown by Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane during their successful stints at the club.\n\nEven though Vinicius struggled in the cup exit at second-tier Albacete, Arbeloa hailed the forward, to a near-absurd degree considering the circumstances.\n\n\"(He wanted) to carry the team on his shoulders, to attack and never hide, that's the Vini I want to see,\" said Arbeloa.\n\nHe followed that up by highlighting Vinicius's previous achievements after he was whistled against Levante, insisting the way forward was to feed him at every opportunity.\n\n\"I'll ask his team-mates to find him more, give him the ball as much as possible,\" said Arbeloa. \"I am proud to be his coach.\"\n\nBellingham was extremely poor against Barca in the Spanish Super Cup final and has scored once in his last 11 games.\n\n\"Up close he's even better than on television, his experience, maturity, leadership...\" said Arbeloa of the Englishman on Saturday.\n\n\"He's one of the team's leaders, the same as Kylian, Vini or Fede. They are players called on to do great things for Real Madrid... when things aren't going well, we have to look for them continuously... we have to make them happy.\"\n\nIt is not just the players under him whom Arbeloa has to take care of, but also president Florentino Perez above.\n\nAsked about some fans chanting for the president to resign, Arbeloa changed his tune somewhat regarding the atmosphere at the Bernabeu, having said supporters had the right to express themselves.\n\n\"(The whistles) aren't from people who don't love Florentino, they are from people who don't love Real Madrid,\" said Arbeloa, laying bare his loyalty to the Madrid chief.\n\n\"We're lucky to have a president who is the most important person, along with Santiago Bernabeu, in the history of this club.\"\n\nOne player who was not targeted by Madrid's fans on Saturday is top goalscorer Kylian Mbappe.\n\nUnlike many of his team-mates the French superstar has had no performance issues this season, netting 30 goals in 26 games across all competitions.\n\nMbappe played against Levante, despite initially being expected to miss the game while recovering from a knee sprain, winning and converting a penalty for the opener.\n\nBarring any setbacks, Mbappe should start against his former side on Tuesday, looking to extend his lead at the top of the European scoring chart.\n\nDespite Mbappe's knee issue Arbeloa did not substitute him or any of the team's main stars against Levante, evading the pitfalls of his predecessor.\n\nHowever once the team's leaders and stars are happy, making them perform together is another question entirely.\n\nIt is a jigsaw puzzle Ancelotti could not solve in his last season, nor Alonso in the months he had at the helm.\n\nWhen Vinicius and Bellingham were the main attackers, Madrid had enough balance to win a La Liga and Champions League double in 2024. Mbappe's subsequent arrival left the team top-heavy.\n\nWith the situation around the club a little calmer, the Monaco game could offer a glimpse into how Arbeloa plans to get the attackers to click without betraying the defence behind them.",

    "description": "The Lakers got a much-needed win on Sunday against a strong Raptors squad.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Lakers' recent extended slump continued on Saturday when they lost 132-116 to the Portland Trail Blazers. In that game, they were without Luka Doncic, Denadre Ayton and Jaxson Hayes, but all three returned to action on Sunday when they hosted the Toronto Raptors.\n\nThe Raptors came into Sunday's game with a 25-18 record, which had them in fourth place in the Eastern Conference, and they boast arguably the NBA's best fast-break attack. It looked like the Lakers were in for another stiff test and possibly their 13th loss in 22 games.\n\nThey found themselves behind 30-21 at the end of the first quarter because of the lackluster defense that has become a habit for them over the last several weeks. But they responded with 11 unanswered points and a 24-6 overall run to start the second quarter. After most of the second and third quarters were close, L.A. went on an 11-3 run to end the third period, and after that, it opened things up en route to a 110-93 victory.\n\nToronto's 93 points were a season low for it, and it shot only 41.8% from the field and 21.9% from 3-point range. Los Angeles started to employ a zone defense in the second quarter that helped turn the tide, and it also outrebounded the Raptors by five and held them to 14 fast-break points. With a 25-16 record, L.A. remains in sixth place in the Western Conference and has a half-game cushion over the seventh-place Phoenix Suns.\n\nSmart helped hold Raptors starting point guard Immanuel Quickley, who came into this game averaging 16.5 points a game, to nine points on 4-of-9 field-goal shooting. Offensively, he made half of his six shot attempts and two of his three 3-point attempts, and he finished with eight points, five rebounds, three assists and one steal, but he committed five turnovers in 25 minutes.\n\nFor the second straight game, LaRavia contributed next to nothing offensively. He made one of his five shot attempts and ended up with two points, to go along with five rebounds, two assists and one steal in 19 minutes.\n\nAyton got the ball fairly often in the first half, allowing him to log 12 points by halftime. The Lakers continued to feed him the ball in prime scoring position throughout the game, and he took full advantage by making all 10 of his shot attempts and five of his six free throw attempts, giving him 25 points. He also grabbed 13 rebounds and added one assist and one block in 33 minutes.\n\nDoncic scored 18 points in the first half, but he was just 5-of-14 from the field during that time, and he had three of his shots blocked by Raptors forward Collin Murray-Boyles. He shot even more poorly in the second half and ended up 8-of-23 overall from the field, although he did go 5-of-12 from 3-point land.\n\nDoncic finished this game with 25 points, seven assists, two rebounds, one steal and one block in 34 minutes.\n\nJames played 32 minutes and shot 9-of-17 from the floor, allowing him to finish with 24 points, seven assists, four rebounds and two blocks. When the Lakers went on that 24-6 run early in the second quarter, he scored nine points to ignite that spurt.\n\nIn 17 minutes, Vincent hit two of his five shot attempts and finished with five points, two assists, one rebound and one steal.\n\nAfter missing three straight games with a hamstring ailment, Hayes played 13 minutes and had two points and five rebounds to help L.A.'s cause.\n\nHachimura may not be fully back in game shape and rhythm after missing seven straight games with a calf injury. But he made a decent contribution on Sunday with 10 points on 4-of-10 shooting in 21 minutes off the bench. However, he didn't have a single rebound, assist, steal or block.\n\nVanderbilt was very active in this contest, and it resulted in him putting up good numbers across the board. In 21 minutes, he grabbed nine rebounds and added two points, one assist, two steals and two blocks. He was a significant factor when the Lakers established a sizable lead late in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter, especially defensively and on the boards.\n\nOne night after scoring 21 points on 9-of-12 shooting, Timme got 16 minutes and went 1-of-4 overall and 1-of-2 from downtown. He finished with three points, three rebounds and two assists.\n\nAll four players were on the court for the final 2:17 of this game. Knecht, the younger James and Bufkin went scoreless and didn't attempt a single shot, while Smith made one of his three shot attempts and had three points.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers player grades: L.A. wins going away against Raptors",

    "fullText": "The NFC Championship Game is set, and it will feature a familiar matchup as the Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams meet for the third time this season, with Seattle opening as the favorite.\n\nOddsmakers at BetOnline.ag have installed the Seahawks as 2.5-point favorites over the Rams in the NFC title game, with the over/under set at 47 points. The opening line reflects a shift from the lookahead number, which had Seattle favored by just one point before the weekend’s playoff results.\n\nThe matchup marks the third meeting between the NFC West rivals this season, with each team winning once at home. The Rams took the first meeting by two points at SoFi Stadium, while the Seahawks answered with a dramatic, comeback one-point overtime victory in Seattle, setting the stage for a tightly contested rubber match with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line.\n\nSeattle’s status as the favorite is also reflected in the updated Super Bowl LX futures. The Seahawks are currently listed as the overall favorites at 3/2 (+150), ahead of the Rams, who sit at 11/5 (+220). The New England Patriots are third at 11/4 (+275), followed by the Denver Broncos at 11/1.\n\nThe Rams’ shorter odds compared to most remaining teams underscore how narrow the gap is perceived to be between the NFC finalists, despite Seattle being favored at home. The Seahawks’ defense and home-field advantage have played a significant role in the early betting action, while the Rams’ ability to keep both regular-season meetings close has kept expectations of another tight game high.\n\nIn the AFC, the betting landscape has also shifted. With Broncos quarterback Bo Nix out with an injury, the AFC Championship Game line has moved significantly, reopening at New England -4 before climbing to Patriots -6.\n\nDespite four teams being eliminated over the weekend, Denver’s Super Bowl odds have lengthened from 8/1 to 11/1, reflecting increased uncertainty around their path to a title without Nix.\n\nFor now, the focus remains on the NFC, where the Seahawks and Rams will meet once more, this time with the conference crown and a Super Bowl berth at stake.",

    "fullText": "Matthew Stafford has spent most of the 2025 season making quarterback play look effortless, but Sunday’s divisional playoff game against the Chicago Bears was a rare quiet afternoon by his standards. The veteran passer failed to throw a touchdown for the first time all year, completing just 20 of 42 attempts for 258 yards in the Rams’ gritty 20–17 overtime victory.\n\nEven in a win that sent Los Angeles to the NFC Championship, Stafford was his own harshest critic. Despite the celebration around him, Stafford didn’t hide from his uneven performance. Speaking after the game, he admitted he never found his usual rhythm.\n\n“No, I definitely didn’t get into a great rhythm today, there’s no question about that,” Stafford said post-game. “Had some opportunities in the pass game, just some things that made it tough. Obviously, I can be better.”\n\nThe Bears’ remarkable season came to a heartbreaking end at SoFi Stadium. Chicago had captured the NFC North, knocked off the Packers in the wild-card round, and taken organizational steps that hadn’t been seen in decades. They nearly added another chapter to that story, rallying in the final minute when Caleb Williams found Cole Kmet on a stunning fourth-down strike to tie the game with 17 seconds left.\n\nOvertime, however, belonged to the Rams. Williams threw a costly interception on a potential game-winning drive, and Los Angeles methodically moved into range for Harrison Mevis, who drilled a 42-yard field goal to seal the victory. The Rams now advance to face the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship, while Chicago is left watching two teams sitting exactly where it hopes to be next season. So, despite the sub-par stat line, Stafford isn’t all that regretful.\n\n“But playoff football is about winning the football game. I played great, threw for a bunch of yards last year in the snow and we lost, and that sucks. I’m happy to have played a little bit worse today and go home with a win. We’ll take that.”\n\nHis stat line backed up the self-assessment: a 47.6 percent completion rate, no touchdowns, no interceptions, and a 67.4 passer rating. It was far from the form that had defined his regular season.\n\nOne off night doesn’t erase what has been a historic campaign. It wouldn’t be a stretch to call this the best season of Stafford’s 17-year career. The 37-year-old averaged 276.9 passing yards per game and eclipsed 4,600 yards for the fifth time, highlighted by a 457-yard explosion against Seattle in Week 16.\n\nHe finished the regular season with more than 45 touchdown passes, leading the league by a wide margin —Jared Goff’s 34 was the next closest total — while throwing just eight interceptions despite consistently pushing the ball downfield. Those numbers kept him firmly in the MVP conversation even as the Rams split their final six games.\n\nSunday’s matchup showed a different version of the Rams offense. Los Angeles leaned heavily on the pass early, asking Stafford to drop back 40 times in regulation while running just seven times in the first half. The ground game found more life after the break, but the contest remained tight thanks to Chicago’s balanced attack of 160 rushing yards on 39 attempts.\n\nIn the end, style points didn’t matter. The Rams capitalized when it counted, and Stafford, despite his first touchdown-less outing, did enough to move his team one step closer to the Super Bowl.\n\nThe post “I Can Be Better”: Matthew Stafford Gets Honest About 0-TD Game vs. Bears Despite 45+ TDs This Season appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills’ 2025-2026 NFL season ended in heartbreak, and quarterback Josh Allen did not hide the toll it took on him. Following the Bills’ playoff loss to the Denver Broncos, Allen cried while addressing reporters, apologizing to his teammates and expressing disappointment over how the season concluded.\n\nThe Bills’ campaign came to an end on January 17, after a defeat to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Divisional Round. Speaking at the post-game press conference, Josh Allen struggled to hold back tears as he addressed the result and his mindset following the loss. “It’s extremely difficult,” Allen said. He continued, “I feel like I let my teammates down tonight.”\n\nWhen asked why the defeat affected him so profoundly, Allen explained that the game featured several moments the team failed to capitalize on. He said there were “missed opportunities throughout the game,” before adding, “It’s been a long season. I hate how it ended, and that’s gonna stick with me for a long time.”\n\nJosh Allen also addressed what he told his teammates in the immediate aftermath of the loss, making it clear that emotions were still raw in the locker room. “I haven’t been doing a lot of talking,” Allen admitted. “I love my teammates, and I’m extremely sorry, and I’m extremely disappointed in how this ended,” he continued. The game itself ended in overtime, when Will Lutz converted a 24-yard field goal to secure the win for the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe press conference also came at a meaningful time in Allen’s personal life, as his wife, Hailee Steinfeld, is currently pregnant and expecting the couple’s first child.\n\nWith the victory, Denver advanced to the AFC Championship Game, where the top-seeded team will face either the New England Patriots or the Houston Texans on January 25. The opponent will be determined following the Patriots-Texans matchup on January 18.\n\nThe post Bills’ Josh Allen Cries After Loss: ‘I Let My Teammates Down’ appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "CHICAGO (AP) — Caleb Williams' last throw in regulation was a backpedaling, fourth-down rainbow that landed in Cole Kmet's hands in the corner of the end zone for a breathtaking touchdown.\n\nHis last throw of the game was the beginning of the end for Chicago's surprising season.\n\nWilliams almost rallied the Bears to another memorable win on Sunday night. But he threw his third interception in overtime and Matthew Stafford drove the Los Angeles Rams to Harrison Mevis' winning field goal in a 20-17 victory in the divisional round of the playoffs.\n\n“It's tough. In these moments, you feel that you let your team down,” Williams said. “You feel this or that. It’s a good lesson learned for us, first time being in this situation for me and for us as a team. I’m excited for what’s to come. But obviously going to go back and watch this and figure out how I can be better, and that’s the exciting part.”\n\nThe 24-year-old Williams led Chicago to an NFL-record seven wins this season when trailing in last 2 minutes of regulation. He threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to DJ Moore with 1:43 left in a 31-27 victory over Green Bay in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nThis time, the Bears (12-7) were losing 17-10 when they got the ball back with 1:50 left in the fourth quarter. And, just like before, Williams delivered.\n\nFacing a fourth-and-4 at the Rams 14 with 27 seconds left, Williams took a shotgun snap and surveyed the field. The No. 1 pick in the 2024 draft was forced to backpedal as the pocket collapsed, and he scampered all the way back to the 40 with Jared Verse, Josaiah Stewart and Braden Fiske all in pursuit for the Rams.\n\nWilliams turned, saw Kmet in the end zone and threw the ball in his direction just as Verse and Stewart got to the second-year QB.\n\n“I ended up getting a little bit of pressure, so try and break contain and just break angles and slow those guys down so that when I do turn around, I can have a little bit more time possibly to find somebody,” Williams said, “and they did a good job containing me, so I just gained a little bit more depth, and I saw Cole one-on-one over there.”\n\nKmet wrestled with Rams cornerback Cobie Turner before hauling in the pass, sending a charge through the crowd of 60,253 on a frigid night at Soldier Field.\n\n“It felt like a pretty easy pitch-and-catch and kind of felt like it was in slow motion,” Kmet said. “I can’t believe Caleb.”\n\nBears coach Ben Johnson called the throw “ridiculous.”\n\n“There’s some things that you just can’t coach. ... He’s got a knack, he’s clutch,” Johnson said.\n\nAccording to Next Gen Stats, Williams' pass traveled 51.2 yards in the air for the longest completed pass by air distance in the red zone since at least 2016. He made the throw from 26.5 yards behind the line of scrimmage; no quarterback since 2016, according to Next Gen Stats, had completed a pass from a depth of more than 22 yards.\n\nIt had a completion probability of 17.8%.\n\n“It was the most special throw that I’ve ever seen. I’ve seen him do that so many times this year,” Bears safety Kevin Byard said.\n\nWilliams also threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Moore on fourth down on the first play of the second quarter. But his three interceptions were costly.\n\nThe Bears had a chance to win the game in overtime. They drove to the Los Angeles 48 before Williams was picked off by Rams safety Kam Curl on a deep ball intended for Moore.\n\n“Just a miscommunication between him and I,” Williams said. \"Tried to flatten him off under the safety, and he kept it vertical from what I saw, obviously, in the moment.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New England Patriots are heading to the AFC Championship Game after taking care of the Houston Texans on Sunday.\n\nThe team will take on the Denver Broncos, who recently found out that starting quarterback Bo Nix will miss the rest of the postseason with a broken ankle. The Broncos were able to beat the Buffalo Bills anyway, but it'll be tough to move forward without their quarterback.\n\nHowever, not everybody is penciling the Patriots into the Super Bowl.\n\nFormer NFL quarterback Nick Foles was watching the game and wanted to remind everybody about something. Foles mentioned that the Patriots \"struggle against backup QBs\" in championship-style games.\n\n\"Note for the Broncos and their fans: I know it has been an emotional 24 hours. I feel for Bo and the team, and I'm sending prayers for a strong recovery,\" Foles said. \"A positive note going into the game versus the Patriots is that they struggle against backup QBs in championship-type games.\"\n\nOf course, Foles is referring to Super Bowl LII, where he stepped in as the backup quarterback and led the Philadelphia Eagles to a win over the Patriots.\n\nIn that game, Foles played like a star, throwing for 373 yards and three touchdowns. The famous \"Philly Special\" play was born that night, and the Patriots received plenty of grief for losing to a backup quarterback.\n\nFoles went on to play one more season with the Eagles after that Super Bowl before signing a massive free agent contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2019.\n\nIt was a hilarious note from Foles, but the situations aren't exactly the same.\n\nFoles was the backup, but he had already been a Pro Bowler once in his career. The quarterback was a reliable veteran passer and one of the best backups in the league.\n\nThe Broncos, though, have to rely on Jarrett Stidham. Stidham has just over 1,400 yards and eight touchdown passes in his career and has never played in a playoff game.\n\nInterestingly, Stidham did spend two seasons with the Patriots, and now he has a chance to prove himself against one of his former teams.\n\nPatrick Mahomes comments on offensive coordinator Matt Nagy\n\nSteelers urged to replace Aaron Rodgers with SEC star\n\nSteelers could find new coach in a familiar place\n\nCould Steelers trade for former first-round pick?\n\nStephen A.

    "description": "Senegal walked off the pitch in protest to a contentious late penalty decision against them, before Brahim Diaz stunningly missed his spot-kick with an inexplicable ‘Panenka’ effort",
    "fullText": "Senegal have been crowned Africa Cup of Nations champions after one of the most chaotic and perplexing conclusions to a major final in football history.\n\nAfter what had been a frantic but goalless game so far, the clash descended into carnage in second-half stoppage time after two controversial decisions against Senegal, the second being a last-gasp penalty for Morocco, led to manager Pape Thiaw dragging his team off the pitch and into the dressing room in protest.\n\nTeranga Lions talisman Sadio Mane remained on the touchline before retrieving his team after a lengthy delay, with referee Jean-Jacques Ndala losing complete control of the match.\n\nBrahim Diaz, who went down softly to win the spot-kick, then stepped up to take the penalty in the 24th minute of additional time, only to see his abysmal ‘Panenka’ attempt float into the arms of Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy, with the game therefore forced into extra time.\n\nPape Sarr went on to score the winner in stunning fashion for Senegal in the 94th minute, with his rocket of an effort proving the difference and denying the Atlas Lions a first Afcon title since 1976.\n\nSenegal thought they had snatched victory at the death when Ismaila Sarr bundled the ball home in the second minute of stoppage time, heading home after Abdoulaye Seck saw his effort ricochet off the post. However, the whistle went very quickly for a soft foul on Achraf Hakimi, who had been brushed off by Seck as the Paris Saint-Germain star tried to hinder the defender.\n\nThiaw and the Senegal players were clearly outraged by Ndala’s decision, which did not appear to receive much of a VAR check. The game swiftly got back underway with the score still goalless.\n\nThree minutes later, Diaz went down in the box under the challenge of left-back El Hadji Malick Diouf, claiming he had been tugged to the ground by the West Ham man. With Diaz vehemently protesting that he had been fouled, the incident was taken to VAR before Ndala was called to the monitor.\n\nOfficials and players jostled with each other while the referee consulted the touchline screen and when Ndala returned to the pitch to award a last-minute spot-kick, giving Morocco a golden chance to snatch Afcon glory, the final plunged into chaos.\n\nThiaw ordered his players off the pitch in protest to what was another soft decision against his Senegal side, initially keeping them on the touchline before dragging them into the dressing room. A handful of Morocco players remained in the box, waiting to take their potentially match-winning penalty as they consulted the referee.\n\nIn the midst of the mayhem, Senegal fans clashed with security as they tried to invade the pitch, with some seen being forcibly carried away. Senegal talisman Mane, however, stayed on the pitch in an act of defiance against his manager’s orders, with the former Liverpool winger clearly keen to get the match restarted. Yet with the Senegal team nowhere to be seen, the outcome of the final hung in the balance.\n\nMane ran into the dressing room to retrieve his players and after a 16-minute hiatus, the Senegal squad returned to the Stade Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium turf to allow Morocco to take their penalty. In what he says was his last ever Afcon match, Mane was evidently instrumental on getting his teammates back on the pitch, with Thiaw eventually giving in and similarly instructing his players to return.\n\nDiaz, the tournament’s top scorer with five goals, stepped up to the plate in the 24th minute of stoppage time, with further delays coming about as goalkeeper Mendy persistently came off his line to speak to the Real Madrid midfielder, perhaps in a bid to put him off.\n\nWhen Diaz eventually took the spot-kick, he inexplicably tried a ‘Panenka’-style chip and has weak penalty sailed tamely into the arms of Mendy, passing up on the opportunity to deliver Morocco a first Afcon title in 50 years. The reaction of the Senegal players - hardly celebrating before turning and running up the other end - raised the eyebrows of viewers.\n\nDiaz was later shown in tears after the match and was completely dejected as he received his golden boot award from Fifa president Gianni Infantino.\n\nWith Diaz’s miss forcing the game to extra time, Thiaw's men, fuelled by a sense of injustice, regrouped and forced their way in front when Gueye surged forward and blasted a left-foot piledriver past Morocco goalkeeper Bono and in off the underside of the crossbar.\n\nBono later denied Cherif Ndiaye a second with a stunning double save and Gueye's contribution ultimately proved decisive.",

    "fullText": "Erling Haaland put in a tired and poor performance for Manchester City in their 2-nil loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford. Manchester City’s top scorer has carried a heavy workload up front in the absence of Omar Marmoush due to international duty, and the injuries suffered by Savinho and Oscar Bobb haven’t helped matters. Haaland is trying hard, but he does seem to need a rest. Omar Marmoush is set to return from international duty with Egypt. With the African Cup of Nations now complete, Marmoush is set to rejoin the City squad. Help is on the way for Manchester City’s attack, but Marmoush may not be available for City’s next match against Bodø/Glimt in the Champions League.\n\nThe return of Omar Marmoush will give Pep Guardiola another option to use up front. Erling Haaland needs a rest, and Omar Marmoush is the player to give him the rest that he needs. With AFCON now complete, Marmoush is set to link up with the Manchester City squad. The hope is that Marmoush will be available for Manchester City’s Champions League league phase fixture against Bodø/Glimt in Norway on Tuesday night. But Pep Guardiola is unsure if Marmoush will be ready to feature at the Aspmyra Stadion.\n\nSpeaking after his team’s derby defeat to Manchester United, Pep Guardiola was asked if Omar Marmoush would be available for Manchester City’s next match against Bodø/Glimt. Guardiola said he didn’t think Marmoush would play in Norway. When asked about Omar Marmoush’s availability, he told the media: “No I don’t think so.”\n\nAlthough Omar Marmoush hasn’t offered much for Manchester City so far this season, they do need the Egyptian international back and firing. So far this season, Marmoush has scored one goal and added one assist in 15 appearances in all competitions. Marmoush has mainly featured as a substitute this season, coming on in the closing stages of matches. He also suffered a knee injury earlier this season, which was a major setback for him.\n\nOmar Marmoush is too good to be a substitute. When fully fit and in form, he offers a completely different threat than Erling Haaland. Marmoush’s movement and intelligent runs in the final third make him a dangerous player. He also has the ability to produce spectacular long-range shots, so Pep Guardiola’s side needs Marmoush back. Hopefully, he has rediscovered his touch and form while playing for Egypt at the African Cup of Nations.\n\nManchester City are about to get a boost with the return of Omar Marmoush. He may not feature in City’s upcoming Champions League fixture against Bodø/Glimt, but he is almost back and ready to contribute for Pep Guardiola’s side, and that is welcome news for City given what lies ahead this season.",

    "fullText": "NFL power rankings: Three reasons Seahawks, Patriots, Rams and Broncos will (and won't) win Super Bowl 60 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWho will win Super Bowl 60? The wide-open 2025-2026 NFL playoffs started with a combined 14 teams from the AFC and NFC, but it's down to four with the conference championship matchups now set for next Sunday.\n\nThe AFC has held form, with the No. 1 seed Denver Broncos (14-3) ready to host the No. 2 seed New England Patriots (14-3). The best team in the NFC, the No. 1 seed Seattle Seahawks (14-3) will host the No. 5 Los Angeles Rams (12-5) in another NFC West rubber match.\n\nAny one of those teams can either win the Super Bowl or fall flat in the league semifinals. Based on each team's odds to finish the playoffs undefeated and raise the Lombardi Trophy, here's looking at why the Seahawks, Patriots, Rams and Broncos will succeed or fail through the last two rounds:\n\n(Futures odds courtesy of Caesars Sportsbook)\n\nThe Seahawks led the NFL scoring defense (16.6 points allowed per game) and were third in total defense (282.8 yards per game) during the regular season. They were No. 2 against the run (92.6 yards per game) and No. 9 against the pass (190.3). They lived up to that reputation and then some in obliterating the 49ers in the divisional round of the playoffs, 41-6.\n\nMORE: How Seahawks smacked 49ers behind dominant defense\n\nThey are in sync with the pressure and coverage and just erased San Francisco's running game. Outside of some issues covering backs and tight ends, Seattle has no defensive weaknesses. They are starting to channel much of the classic \"Legion of Boom\" energy from their Super Bowl 48-winning team.\n\nThe Seahawks ran the ball on 50.6 percent of their offensive plays, No. 2 in the NFL behind only the Ravens. They were No. 7 in rushing yards per game, averaging 126.2 yards. With a blowout in the divisional round, Seattle rushed the ball at a 63.5 percent clip, producing 175 yards on 33 attempts, with Kenneth Walker III (116 yards, 3 TDs) carrying the load after Zach Charbonnet (knee) got hurt.\n\nWhen Seattle can run the ball at a high clip, it takes a lot of pressure off Sam Darnold in the passing game. With their offensive line getting great interior blocking, it's a tough rushing attack to stop.\n\nThe Seahawks' run blocking has been on point and Klint Kubiak has done well to keep the offense balanced so it maintains explosiveness, too.\n\nSam Darnold has responded in his reunion with Kubiak, playing well off the running game. It's wise to trust elite breakout wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba to make the big plays needed all the way through the end zone. Darnold has also hit on well-timed deep shots to other wideouts and made good use of his tight ends when called upon. Darnold has been fortunate to land in another QB-friendly system after his big season with Minnesota.\n\n1. Too little from the passing game\n\nDarnold is falling into the Trent Dilfer-Brad Johnson category of potential Super Bowl quarterbacks. He is more of a complementary strong supporter on a team led by defense and the running game. However, Darnold should be prepared to try to win another shootout in Seattle with Matthew Stafford after not needing to much to beat the 49ers.\n\nFor such a dominant team, the Seahawks were minus-3 in turnover margin during the regular season. They were second in the NFL with their 28 giveaways and Darnold threw 14 of Seattle's 15 interceptions. Although they crushed the 49ers in the turnover battle, 3-0, to reverse that trend, the Rams will be out looking for mistakes from Darnold.\n\nThe Seahawks were a middle of the pack offense on third down this season, converting on 39.8 percent of third-down chances. Seattle's third down struggles were highlighted in the divisional round, going 4-for-10 (40 percent) in the playoff rout of the 49ers. The Seahawks will need do better at sustaining drives or meet a playoff exit.\n\nThe Patriots' secondary was active and a big reason why they thwarted the Texans' makeshift receiving corps. C.J. Stroud saw some pressure, but his bad passes cost him because New England was opportunistic. New England also was all over ripping into Justin Herbert and his receivers in the wild-card round. The defense, not the offense, is why the Patriots remain alive, one game away from the Super Bowl.\n\nMaye got out of some his early playoff jitters and kinks against the Texans and Chargers, facing a lot more pressure in two senses and being less accurate and careful with the ball. But after a hot finish vs. Houston's brutal all-around defensive test with little help from the traditional running game, Maye should have a lot more confidence he can do what Josh Allen did in Denver to the Broncos' defense, only minus the turnovers.\n\nMORE: Why Patriots won't get away with sloppy Drake Maye vs. Bo Nix-less Broncos\n\nMike Vrabel and Josh McDaniels have proved to be strong Belichickian proxies for New England with Maye and the young defensive talent making their jobs much easier to execute at a high level. Vrabel has wasted no time returning to the ranks off top NFL coaches, picking up where left off with lesser teams in Tennessee.\n\nMaye has gotten sloppy with his ball security when running or keeping pass plays alive in the pocket. He has also thrown an interception in each of his first two playoff games, and luckily hasn't been picked off more with some anomalous inaccuracy. The Patriots must win the turnover battle all-around to win the war.\n\nMORE: Texans can't take advantage of Drake Maye's turnover troubles\n\nMaye is in Year 2. Everyone's adjusting to the Vrabel-McDaniels era after one bad transitional year with Jerod Mayo. There is some youth serving well on the defense despite its green nature. The Patriots are a facing a tight-nit Broncos' defense and would get either the swarming Seahawks or the savvier Sean McVay-led Rams in the Super Bowl.\n\nThe Patriots tend to give up touchdowns deep when their opponents can sustain long drives. They made the Texans look better in this major area of struggle on Sunday. Not holding for field goals on a couple drives can make the biggest difference for Maye and the offense moving forward.\n\nMcVay is the best coach in the NFL, considering his offensive play-calling acumen, motivational skills and situational understanding. He took advantage of a flawed field to push the team toward its first championship under him in Super Bowl 56. His offensive staff and defensive coordinator Chris Shula crush it every week, too.\n\nMORE: Why Sean McVay-Ben Johnson postgame handshake was cordial\n\n2. Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua and Davante Adams\n\nStafford might have more chemistry with Nacua and Adams than he did with Cooper Kupp and his other receivers four years ago. Nacua is off to a historic start with his production and Adams' red zone dominance has further stamped his Hall of Fame career. Stafford has been on point getting them the ball and it's also opened up big plays downfield and after the catch for the tight ends and other receivers.\n\n3. A strong defensive front seven\n\nThe back end of the Rams' defense has had some coverage breakdowns at corner and safety, exploitable in several matchups. The Rams won their last Super Bowl with Aaron Donald as the linchpin and Jalen Ramsey as the mercenary. Now they've a rebuilt a stout disruptive corps with Jared Verse, Kobie Turner, Braden Fiske, Nate Landman and other active youngsters.\n\n1. Not running the ball enough or effectively\n\nThe Rams have a good rushing attack, especially in short yardage and in the red zone. They stuck with the run 31 times against the Bears, with Kyren Williams scoring both of their TDs. But they averaged only 3.6 yards a carry and couldn't put the game away with the rushing attack in the fourth quarter. They can't get afford to get stuck being too one-dimensional for Stafford's sake.\n\nThe Rams made some huge interceptions against Caleb Williams to help survive in the divisional round. But they also had some major coverage breakdowns and benefitted from a few just-missed connections and drops by the Bears receivers.\n\nMcVay tends to be old-school for still being a young hotshot calling the offensive shots at age 39. For example, he could have trusted Stafford and the passing game to run out the clock with one more first down in regulation, but invited the Bears back in with a late short punt. Some tougher fourth-down calls might be required to outlast the Seahawks plus either the Patriots or Broncos.\n\nSean Payton and defensive coordinator Vance Joseph have been on point, coaching complementary football. Payton has the experience of winning Super Bowl 44 while leading the Saints and will extract the most out of his now more injury-riddled roster one last time. That includes scheming to make backup Jarrett Stidham semi-successful filling in for Bo Nix.\n\nThe Broncos dodged a bullet with cornerback Patrick Surtain returning vs. the Bills. They also saw more playmakers come though in the secondary behind good pressure on Allen, led by Ja'Quan McMillan in the slot corner role. Nik Bonitto and others set Denver up for success against the Bills and should be ready to tee off against Drake Maye and the Patriots.\n\nWith Nix out for the season with a broken bone in his ankle, his early legacy of being a clutch late-game quarterback may rub off with the whole team. Expect Denver to rally around Stidham to come through in the end.\n\n1. No Bo Nix and more offensive injuries\n\nStidham will likely need to go to work minus wide receivers Pat Bryant and Troy Franklin, just as the young targets were starting to come through for Nix. Now Stidham is dealing with a short-handed receiving corps on top of being rusty and jittery playing against his first NFL team at home.\n\nMORE:Why Nick Foles thinks Broncos have a chance after Bo Nix injury\n\nThe Broncos didn't find a reliable rushing attack even against the Bills' porous run defense, with Nix's scrambling leading the way in the running game. The team misses the power and juice of JK Dobbins with rookie RJ Harvey providing only some flashes without power-running substance. If the Broncos can't take pressure off Stidham with the running game vs. a nasty Patriots run defense, Stidham should be prepared to see a lot of heat in his face.\n\nSurtain and McMillan saved the day in many ways against the Bills, but the Broncos are not known for making big plays on the ball with only 10 interceptions and four fumble recoveries from the regular season. They need to be sound fundamentally for Vance Joseph and win the situational battles on third down and in the red zone. Any little crack in coverage and Maye will exploit it for chunk passes downfield with his fearless, big arm.",

    "fullText": "Sean McVay did not have a great night coaching against the Chicago Bears, making some questionable calls for the Los Angeles Rams offense. He admitted to having an off night, but all that matters is the Rams won and are moving on to the NFC title game.\n\nMcVay was grateful his players performed well enough to get the win, showing them appreciation and a lot of respect in the locker room after the Rams’ victory. He gave a passionate speech at Soldier Field before the Rams packed up for Los Angeles, crediting them for overcoming adversity and not giving up when things didn’t go their way.\n\nHe singled out Kamren Curl for his outstanding night, recording 13 tackles, two passes defensed and a game-changing interception in overtime.\n\n“How about my (expletive) man Kam Curl!” McVay yelled.\n\nKicker Harrison Mevis also got a shoutout from McVay for delivering the game-winner from 42 yards out, sending the Rams to the NFC title game.\n\n“And then, finding a way to end the (expletive). Where’s Mevis at?!” he shouted, giving the big kicker a big hug.\n\nBATTLED. ADVANCED. ONTO THE NEXT. 🗣️ pic.twitter.com/oUjReIUmqu\n\n— Los Angeles Rams (@RamsNFL) January 19, 2026\n\nUp next for the Rams are the Seahawks, who will be the home team in next weekend’s NFC title game.\n\n“Let’s get our (expletive) minds right for Seattle,” McVay said to close it out.\n\nThe Rams have a great chance to reach their third Super Bowl under McVay, which would be a remarkable stretch in only nine seasons at the helm. One more win and they’ll be back in the big game with a chance to win another Lombardi.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rams Wire: Rams' Sean McVay gives passionate locker room speech after playoff win",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nKevin Durant made some major NBA history during the Houston Rockets’ 119-110 win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday night.\n\nWith his point production in the contest, Durant moved into sixth place on the NBA’s all-time scoring list, passing Dallas Mavericks legend Dirk Nowitzki in the process.

He always was supportive of my career and my game. So, you know to be up there with a legend like that, it's just insane. And be right under Michael Jordan, it's crazy man.\n\n\"I want to continue to keep stacking, keep climbing up the charts, just see how I finish. It's been amazing so far.\"\n\nNow, only five players have ever scored more points than Durant in the NBA. Those five players are LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan.\n\nDurant now needs just 731 points to pass Jordan to move into the top five on the all-time scoring list – a fitting place to be for one of the best scorers we’ve ever seen.\n\nJa Morant addresses ongoing trade speculation with just three words\n\nLeBron James quotes Jay-Z to tease eventual retirement\n\nDillon Brooks blasts Grizzlies for how he was treated by team",

    "description": "The St. Xavier Bombers won their 42nd team title and the Mason girls took home a fourth consecutive gold trophy at the 2026 Southwest Ohio Classic.",
    "fullText": "The Southwest Ohio Classic is a Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend tradition in Cincinnati. It's billed as the largest high school swimming meet of its kind in the country and has produced some of the greatest swimming moments in this city's history.\n\nThe 2026 edition was no different. Over two days at 11 different sites, swimmers and divers worked to continue their impressive seasons while also using the weekend as a tune-up for the fast-approaching postseason.\n\nHere are five of the biggest storylines from this year's meet. Complete results can be found here.\n\nThe Kings senior and Georgia signee recorded one of the greatest performances in meet history, breaking four meet records, two of which she set last year.\n\nShe won the 100-yard backstroke and 100-yard butterfly in back-to-back fashion on Saturday, but had a little more time in between her 200-yard individual medley and 200-yard backstroke victories on Sunday.\n\n\"I was just thinking about my training and what I've been training for, and trying to keep my technique and strategy together and do what I've been practicing. I think that I executed that really well,\" Schweikert said.\n\nShe is the two-time defending Division I 100-yard backstroke state champion and won the 100-yard butterfly in 2025 but may switch up her postseason regimen this time around. She called the individual medley a mental challenge but is starting to like that event.\n\n\"Honestly, I do better with no expectation. It's kind of just getting in and swimming. So keeping that up and not having the expectations, just practicing what I've been practicing. You have no idea what you're capable of until you do it,\" Schweikert said.\n\nAdditional multi-event winners include St. Xavier's Chase Grisi, Mason's Bella Teply and Dana Fairbanks, Roger Bacon's Reese Reilly, Milford's Brady Campbell, Elder's Reese Morgan and Springfield Shawnee's Madi Lee. All except Campbell, Morgan and Lee are seniors, showcasing just how deep this year's senior class is. Expect to see the majority of those names atop the podium in Canton in the last weekend of February.\n\n\"We have a lot of great athletes in our senior class this year and it's always exciting to see everybody swim fast and show what Cincinnati can do as a whole,\" Reilly said.\n\nThe Roger Bacon senior and Duke signee is the two-time defending DII 100-yard breaststroke winner and set a school record in the 100-yard butterfly this season. She missed the meet record by one-tenth of a second but won her second event of the weekend after claiming the 200-yard breaststroke on Saturday.\n\n\"Just a few things that I could clean up, like my walls. But overall, I think it was a good swim and that the rest of the season has a lot of potential, too,\" Reilly said.\n\nThe race for the girls team title was tight at the top as Mason won with 445 points, St. Ursula recorded its third runner-up finish in four years with 414 points and Ursuline came in third with 400 points.\n\n\"We want to continue the momentum moving into the end of the season, but it's so hard to tell what the future holds. We see two of the best teams right here, right now, so it's a really good gauge to see what what we're getting into and what we have to play with,\" head coach Grace Seibert said.\n\nThe Lions also took third place at the 2025 DI state meet with 169 points, just 26 behind Mason. It was their best finish since they claimed back-to-back titles in 2013 and 2014. They were bolstered by now-seniors Melia Eckman, Alyssa Uhlman and Grier Gordon, and junior Norah Smyth winning the 400-yard freestyle relay but have several key contributors making their way through the ranks.\n\nWhile Eckman won the 50-yard freestyle, freshman Kaia Pohlmeyer took second place in the 50-yard breaststroke. Junior Maisie Moran is also a promising backstroke and individual medley swimmer.\n\n\"Even though we have a lot of seniors, I think we have a lot of depth that can help carry us through,\" Seibert said.\n\nCampbell became Milford's first swimming state champion when he claimed the 2025 DI 50-yard freestyle. He also swam on the 200- and 400-yard freestyle relays that placed third, the highest relay finishes in school history.\n\nAt the 2026 Southwest Ohio Classic, he won the 50- and 100-yard freestyles, the 100-yard breaststroke and the 100-yard butterfly. The breaststroke is his newest stroke but as one of the top swimmers in the state, he caught on to it naturally.\n\n\"I kind of just got into it last year at our conference meet. I found out I have a passion or a liking for it and ever since, I've just been working on it in practice,\" Campbell said.\n\nStill just a junior, he said one of his events in the postseason will definitely be the butterfly, where he was the 2025 state runner-up. In the next few weeks, he will explore his options for which freestyle distance he will contest.\n\n\"This season's been great for me. I've opened a bunch of doors for those different distances. For the freestyle, it's still kind of up in the air. The 50, 100 and 200, they all have great competition and I've just been getting better at all three,\" Campbell said.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of the girls program, the Comets boys team showed over the weekend that it should contend for a second straight top five placement at the state meet.\n\nMason actually led St. Xavier in the team standings heading into the final event, but a Bomber win in the 400-yard freestyle relay saw them keep their Southwest Classic undefeated streak alive. The margin between St. Xavier and Mason was one of the closest in meet history, with the Bombers winning with 703 points to Mason's 696.5.\n\n\"We've been super excited ever since state last year. We've had a goal, since a lot of us are seniors and juniors, to make this year as special as possible,\" Mason senior Aidan Jansen said.\n\nLast year's state team consisted of five juniors (Jansen, Ethan Tu, Robert Wall, Liam Clark, Yassin Ghobril) and five sophomores (Mulenga Cole, Noah Kirk, Samyak Ramchandre, Max Vazquez, Austin Zhong). All made valuable contributions over the weekend. Even sophomore Jake Xu, who swam in the 500-yard freestyle prelims as a freshman, has improved. He won the Southwest Classic 1,650-yard freestyle in 16:11.42, overtaking St. X's Alex Nixon midway through the race.\n\n\"We've got a lot of events with a lot of guys that are really good, and even with the four person limit on the lineup, it's gonna be hard because we've got so many people who are so good,\" Jansen said.\n\nThe two finals sessions saw some of the fastest times in meet history as seven meet records were broken in Saturday night's finals session and two more fell on Sunday night, including the oldest record in meet history.\n\nGirls 200-yard freestyle: Michelle Dean, Bellbrook, 1:47.57 (previously set by Finneytown's Buffy Kreiger with a time of 1:48.64 in 1985)\n\nBoys 200-yard freestyle: Chase Grisi, St. Xavier, 1:36.39 (Jason Zhao, Indian Hill, 1:37.41, 2025)\n\nBoys 50-yard freestyle: Brady Campbell, Milford, 20.06 seconds (Aaron Sequira, Walnut Hills, 20.18 seconds, 2020)\n\nGirls 500-yard freestyle: Bella Teply, Mason, 4:51.01 (Amanda Smith, Indian Hill, 2007, and Zoe Thatcher, Mason, 2013, 4:53.1)\n\nBoys 200-yard freestyle relay: St. Xavier, 1:21.47 (St. Xavier, 1:22.42, 2017)\n\nGirls 100-yard backstroke: Maya Schweikert, Kings, 53.23 seconds (Schweikert, 53.28 seconds, 2025)\n\nGirls 100-yard butterfly: Maya Schweikert, Kings, 53.51 seconds (Ella Jo Piersma, Seven Hills, 55.1 seconds, 2022)\n\nGirls 200-yard individual medley: Maya Schweikert, Kings, 2:00.41 (Jenny Forster, Centerville, 2:01.15, 2005)\n\nGirls 200-yard backstroke: Maya Schweikert, Kings, 1:55.33 (Schweikert, 1:56.93, 2025)\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Records fall, postseason prep begins at 2026 Southwest Ohio Classic",

    "description": "Seven years ago we traveled to Scunthorpe United under Jack Ross - can you guess the score?!",
    "fullText": "Jack Ross really wasn’t that far away, but if I ask you to guess the score from a game in his first season as manager, you can probably guess. Even seven years down the line, that scoreline is etched on our brains when it comes to thinking about the 2018-19 season.\n\nConsidering the circumstances that he took the job, it was a good season on paper. Ross came from Scotland to take on what was probably one of the hardest jobs in football at that time, and he took to the training pitch on his first day without the relevant number of players to put out a matchday squad.\n\nIt was vital that we got off to a good start against Charlton Athletic on the opening day, and it seemed like it would only end in promotion, considering we’d lost only two games before the turn of the year. For the conversation to come, around a quarter of those league games before New Year’s Day ended 1-1.\n\n2019 began with a 1-0 win at Blackpool, but then the next two games ended in a 1-1 draw. On this day eight years ago, we travelled to Scunthorpe United, which puts our current position into perspective.\n\nStuart McCall had recently taken charge at Scunthorpe and had won the previous four successive games, so it was never going to be easy, but Sunderland were clearly off the pace from the off. Jon McLaughlin was required to save the lads on several occasions to stop the home side from taking the lead.\n\nRoss’ side was comfortable in possession, but it rarely went anywhere and chances were at a premium as it went into the break goalless. Around the hour mark, Josh Maja did his thing. It came from good work by Reece James, who supplied Maja to glance the ball home.\n\nInstead of taking the game to the hosts and putting the game to bed, we aimed to frustrate them, which meant they stayed in the game. As it got closer to the final whistle, both sides became more desperate, but with a few minutes to go, it happened.\n\nAdam Hammil hit an unstoppable shot from the edge of the box that curled into the top corner to give Scunthorpe a point that they deserved and once again left Sunderland regretting not putting the game out of sight.\n\nSunderland: McLaughlin, James, Dunne, Flanagan, O’Nien, Power, Cattermole, Gooch, McGeady, Maja (Watmore), Maguire (Wyke) Subs: Ruiter, Matthews, Oviedo, McGeouch, Baldwin\n\nScunthorpe: Alnwick, Borthwick-Jackson, McMahon, Ojo (Hammil), Perch, Novak, Thomas (Lund), Burgess, Sutton (Van Veen), McArdle, Wooton Subs: Flatt, Webster, Lewis, McGahey",

    "description": "The Arizona Cardinals are undergoing some big changes this offseason, so why not start over at quarterback as well?",
    "fullText": "Cardinals urged to replace Kyler Murray with 30-TD SEC star originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals are undergoing some big changes this offseason.\n\nThe team endured a terrible season in 2025 and moved on from head coach Jonathan Gannon as a result. Now, the team is looking for a new coaching staff and could potentially be looking for a new quarterback as well.\n\nKyler Murray, who's been the team's passer since 2019, played in just five games this year. Even when Murray played, the results were underwhelming, and his massive contract isn't conducive to being a backup.\n\nAs a result, Jacob Infante of PFSN recently published a full seven-round mock draft that has the Cardinals taking a rookie quarterback.\n\nInfante has the Cardinals waiting until the third round and selecting Ole Miss quarterback Trinidad Chambliss. Chambliss is currently in a legal battle to get one more year of college eligibility, but the expectation is that he will enter the draft.\n\nRegarding Chambliss and the Cardinals, Infante offered the following:\n\nThere are valid concerns with Trinidad Chambliss: he has an average arm, he’s undersized, and he started at the D1 level for only one year. That said, there’s also a lot to like. He’s a naturally accurate passer with impressive anticipation behind his throws, and he came in clutch in key situations for Ole Miss this year.\n\nSomeone will take a chance on him early, given how many NFL teams need quarterbacks this offseason.\n\nAs Infante mentioned, Chambliss only has one year of starting experience at the D1 level, but that one year was incredibly impressive.\n\nIn 2025 with Ole Miss, Chambliss threw for 3,937 yards with 22 touchdowns and just three interceptions. The quarterback also rushed for 527 yards and eight touchdowns, accounting for 30 total scores in 13 starts.\n\nBefore 2025, Chambliss played at DII Ferris State, where he won two national championships. The quarterback isn't the biggest, but he is bigger than Murray, and has a strong arm and nice mobility.\n\nIt wouldn't be easy to move on from Murray, though. The only way the team wouldn't have to eat a ton of dead money is if they traded Murray after June 1. In that scenario, the team would free up about $35 million in cap space.\n\nPatrick Mahomes comments on offensive coordinator Matt Nagy\n\nSteelers urged to replace Aaron Rodgers with SEC star\n\nSteelers could find new coach in a familiar place\n\nCould Steelers trade for former first-round pick?\n\nStephen A. Smith ripped by Jets reporter for controversial comments\n\nMike McDaniel could find a new job soon",

    "title": "How Might Sunderland Handle Any Further January Departures?",
    "description": "Phil Smith assesses the lie of the land at the Stadium of Light, and who might be in line for an exit this month",
    "fullText": "I think everyone can agree that the summer transfer window was a huge success.\n\nThe signs are that January will be a lot quieter with the majority of work focused on outgoings. Given the numbers in the “bomb squad” — plus those out on loan — has the club left itself with a problem?\n\nObviously the most effort will go into moving on those exiled from first-team training but still at the club — and there’s has already been some success with Timothée Pembélé, Jay Matete and Joe Anderson at new clubs, leaving Abdoullah Ba and Ian Poveda looking for a way out.\n\nThere are also a few current “bench warmers” who might leave.\n\nThe most obvious one is Dan Neil, with Anthony Patterson another. However, Régis Le Bris has stated he wants a replacement before Patterson can move on, so that one is less likely. Elsewhere, Harrison Jones and Leo Hjelde might go out on loan but regardless of his contract situation, I can’t see why the club would want to move Dennis Cirkin on.​\n\nThe problem that is rapidly coming into view is what to do with the current (eight) first-team loan players. Of Niall Huggins, Patrick Roberts, Nazariy Rusyn, Jenson Seelt, Hemir, Adil Aouchiche, Alan Browne and Milan Aleksić, it appears that none — other than perhaps Seelt — has a future at the club.\n\nThat’s a lot to move on, so has the club been negligent in collecting so many players with no future? Like any club, there has been a huge turnover of players since the 2021/2022 season — some permanent, most loans.\n\nMany, such as Alex Pritchard and Danny Batth, were great servants, whereas others, like Leon Dajaku, weren’t. Maybe we lost a little on transfer deals for some players, but no huge sums. Of course, wages are also an issue, but I doubt we were paying out significant sums.\n\nRoberts and Huggins arrived in the 2021-22 season, so let’s start an analysis.\n\nOf the bomb squad, only Poveds could be classed as an “established” player and of the loanees, only Roberts, Rusyn, Browne and perhaps Aouchiche. Most new arrivals, such as Trai Hume and Eliezer Mayenda, were brought in as “ones for the future”.\n\nOf the players signed from the 2021-22 season to the end of the 2024-25 season, Hume, Dan Ballard, Romaine Mundle, Mayenda and Wilson Isidor are now first-teamers in the Premier League. Jack Clarke and Jobe Bellingham made significant contributions and delivered a large profit when they moved on, but what about the rest?\n\nWe could argue all day about what counts as a “successful” transfer. As everyone seems obsessed with data, maybe a data scientist could provide some clues.\n\nIn his book How To Win The Premier League (a great read, by the way), Ian Graham suggests that if a player purchased for more than £10 million fails to start 50% of the league games played in the following two seasons, the transfer should be classed as a failure.\n\nGraham also states that 46% of players bought for £10 million or more across all teams in the Premier League between 1992 and January 2021 failed to reach the 50% mark in the seasons immediately after their arrival.\n\nUnfortunately, that model can’t be applied to Sunderland — at least not yet. Under the current ownership, no player was purchased for anywhere near £10 million until the last transfer window, and as mentioned above, we bought more development players than established.\n\nI suggest a reasonable measure of success would be if a player participated in twenty games (roughly half a season) during their Sunderland career. This takes account of the transfer strategy, our League One/Championship status, low transfer fees and relatively low wages.\n\nFrom the “bomb squad” and loanees, only four (Pembélé, Anderson, Poveda and Aleksic) failed to hit the twenty-appearance mark. Given we found a few gems along the way and collected some hefty transfer fees, I don’t think it’s reasonable to complain.\n\nNow, just for a bit of fun, let’s apply Graham’s model to the last transfer window.\n\nTen players came in for fees rumoured to be over £10 million: Habib Diarra, Simon Adingra, Enzo Le Fée, Brian Brobbey, Chemsdine Talbi, Noah Sadiki, Granit Xhaka, Nordi Mukiele, Omar Alderete and Robin Roefs.\n\nAssuming they all stay for two seasons, then how many will pass the test? I’ll take a punt on eight. If I’m right, that’s impressive business!",

    "description": "For Sunderland fan Deborah Laverick, the opportunity to spread the word of Sunlun to the people of Africa at AFCON 2026 was an opportunity she couldn’t pass up!",
    "fullText": "Like most Sunderland fans, I had heard of AFCON but truthfully only knew the basics.\n\nBut after a week in Marrakech, I was increasingly aware of my Mambas, Super Eagles, Zebras, Leopards, Elephants and had even figured out that Bafana Bafana that I kept hearing about was in fact the nickname of the South Africa team and not one of their players.\n\nUpon arrival at the airport there were lots of fans milling about taking photos with AFCON displays. One lucky group of South Africans were competition winners who had been tasked with supporting their first game and they started singing as soon as they got off the plane.\n\nYou may have seen lots of empty seats at matches that did not involve Morocco. There has been lots of discussion about whether Moroccans were not supporting AFCON. Unfortunately, the experience of obtaining tickets on the digital-only platform was problematic. Before you even tried, you needed to set up a Fan ID where your phone’s NFC had to scan the chip in your passport. I know several people who never got past this process.\n\nThey also cut off ticket sales 24 hours before kick-off without prior warning. African football fans tend to purchase last minute so no doubt thousands of ticket sales were lost for each match.\n\nFor this reason, myself and several pals missed out on South Africa vs Angola, a match where I was directly emailed by the ticket office to say it was sold out, but in fact only had an attendance of 4,013.\n\nThe empty seats were such a concern that in Agadir at Egypt vs Zimbabwe, an announcement was made shortly before kick-off that the stadium had opened for free entry. Consequently, by the end of the first half the stadium had filled up with Moroccan locals.\n\nOne of the highlights for me was the Fanzone based at Camellos, which we went to for Morocco vs Comoros. We arrived several hours before kick-off and the traditional music and dancing had already started outside the entrance. The Fanzone itself was impressive. A vast space with lots of activities for kids (including what can only be described as sumo wrestling football).\n\nThere were lots of photo opportunities with AFCON posters, which were noteworthy, as Adingra was a chosen poster boy.\n\nThere was a party zone in the corporate area where the singing and dancing reached a new level of intensity and a vast viewing space with three large screens, pre-match entertainment and a stage with in-built fireworks for the big moments. Singing and dancing fans paraded in waving flags and flares and singing.\n\nWe were very excited for the atmosphere with thousands of fans packed into the viewing zone.\n\nBizarrely though, when the match started, it was watched in virtual silence. We returned to the main square at half-time to watch the screen there. Again, thousands of fans, but an unanticipated calm. Although people cheered when Morocco scored, a return to an eerie silence occurred within a minute.\n\nLater, I discussed this with locals and they asked “Were there lots of police around?” I said “Yes” and they stated “Then that is why. It would be louder if you watched in cafes.”\n\nPerhaps the strangest phenomenon was when the match finished the screens were instantly turned off and, like a dispersing flashmob, the Square returned to its usual joyful, noisy hustle and bustle. The snakes, monkeys and traditional musicians were back in place within minutes.\n\nThe Game – Ivory Coast vs Mozambique. Stade de Marrakech\n\nFinally, Christmas Eve and the big match with Mozambique’s Reinildo arrived.\n\nMy friend Nassima and I headed off in the rain on her motorbike with a bag full of last season’s strips that Sunderland AFC had kindly donated to this wannabe Mackem Santa. Epic fail, however, in forgetting my Santa hat and being unable to find a replacement in the souks.\n\nSunderland AFC had asked me to wear a red and white Reinildo shirt, and as we flew along the motorway, I heard another motorbike shout, “Hey Sunderland, Reinildo. We met you in the souks.” Now, on my first day exploring, I might have been a bit excited, running around and singing football songs with all the souk owners.\n\nSo both bikes joined in a rendition of “He’s in your head, in your head, Talbi, Talbi, Talbi ii ii.”\n\nWe arrived at the Stade de Marrakech, a stadium with a capacity of 45,240. The attendance was 13,041 which still generated a great atmosphere despite the failings of the stadium which had a running track between pitch and fans and also had some kind of artificial hybrid surface which seemed to upend players in the rain.\n\nThis was after we had had to walk about a kilometre to the stadium and go through at least six ticket checkpoints. Nassima and I gave out strips to as many fans as we could and turned our part of the stands red and white in the hope Reinildo would see.\n\nWe clocked that strips will be taken back to eight different nations spreading the Mackem joy – Mozambique, Morocco, Ivory Coast, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Denmark, America and France (from where I discovered a Talbi lookalike called Adam). Reinildo lined up as a centre-back but alas the result was not meant to be, although watching Amad score for the Ivory Coast was wonderful. To borrow from a recent Welbeck quote, we all know Amad is a Mackem at heart, so still an early Christmas pressie for this fan.\n\nAFCON was an absolute privilege to experience and I would recommend it to any fan. AFCON 2027 will take place in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. A shout out to barman Hamza who educated me on all aspects of this magnificent tournament and put the Sunderland vs Brighton match on for me.\n\nIf you would like to learn more follow the official social media which goes by the name ‘TotalEnergies Africa Cup of Nations’ which I found invaluable. And to give you a lasting smile on your face, enjoy Reinildo’s singing and dancing with his Mamba teammates in this YouTube clip. Cracking singing and dancing by Reinildo!\n\nI hope he brings it back to the SOL.",

    "fullText": "One player who was conspicuous by his absence when Michael Carrick named his first Manchester United squad was Joshua Zirkzee.\n\nThe Dutchman has started only four Premier League games all season, as former head coach Ruben Amorim was clearly not a fan.\n\nWith his minutes drastically reduced, the Netherlands international was keen to jump ship in January, with AS Roma pushing hard for his signature.\n\nThey had proposed an initial loan with a conditional obligation and had even submitted their contract with the 24-year-old’s representatives.\n\n25/26 season stats via Transfermarkt\n\nHowever, Amorim’s sack meant an exit was blocked and it was decided that the former Bologna ace would not be allowed to leave in winter.\n\nThe Giallorossi finally admitted defeat, but with Amad and Bryan Mbeumo back, and Benjamin Sesko’s red-hot form, the former Bayern Munich star is unlikely to start too many games.\n\nWhich is why Juventus have identified him as their Plan B in case they fail to persuade Crystal Palace to part with Jean-Philippe Mateta as per Teamtalk.\n\n“Juventus have an eye on Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee in case they fail in their bid to sign Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta, sources confirm.\n\n“There is a belief that he will still do well back in Serie A, where he had a good spell with Bologna.\n\n“Roma tried to sign him this month but ran into difficulties after Ruben Amorim departed – so even a deal for the United man would not be easy, even though he is keen on a new challenge.”\n\nDespite Joshua Zirkzee being open to the possibility, it will be a difficult deal to crack unless INEOS bring in another forward.\n\nWith Champions League qualification the goal, the co-owners cannot afford to leave Carrick short in the second-half of the campaign.\n\nThe versatile forward is currently injured, and it will be interesting to see if he makes the matchday squad for the game against Arsenal. Should his chances continue to be limited, he might yet push for an exit later in the window.\n\nFeature image Molly Darlington via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "title": "Lasses Review: Pride In Defeat As Sunderland’s FA Cup Journey Ends",
    "description": "Charlotte Patterson reports from Eppleton as Sunderland Women’s FA Cup campaign was curtailed by London City Lionesses",
    "fullText": "The Adobe Women’s FA Cup clash between Sunderland AFC Women and London City Lionesses at Eppleton Colliery Welfare Ground was always destined to be a stern test for the Lasses.\n\nWith London City arriving as one of the most possession-dominant and technically proficient sides in the competition, Sunderland knew they would need to adapt tactically to withstand the pressure, and adapt they did, shifting from their usual 4-2-3-1 formation to a more compact and defensively resilient 5-2-3 setup designed to absorb the Lionesses’ attacking waves and strike on the counter.\n\nFrom the opening whistle, the Lionesses asserted their dominance in possession, moving the ball with precision and intent.\n\nSunderland, however, weren’t passive observers and their five-player back line — marshalled superbly by Rhiannon Roberts, Hannah Greenwood and Brianna Westrup — held firm, maintaining shape and discipline. Jessica Brown and Louise Griffiths flanked the triple pairing, whilst Emily Scarr and Katie Kitching dropped deep to support defensively.\n\nGrace Moloney was largely untroubled in the opening forty five minutes. Aside from a dangerous cross that she punched clear with authority, she had little else to do — a testament to the defensive wall erected in front of her.\n\nThe Lionesses’ attempts to penetrate the final third were repeatedly thwarted, with Sunderland’s midfield duo of Natasha Fenton and Marissa Sheva working tirelessly to close passing lanes and disrupt rhythm.\n\nKitching, deployed on the wing rather than in her usual number ten role, showed tremendous work rate, tracking back and doubling up defensively when needed. Scarr mirrored that commitment on the opposite flank, never shirking her duties and often initiating the press when the Lionesses looked to build from the back.\n\nDespite the Lionesses’ territorial advantage, they were severely restricted in terms of clear-cut chances — Sunderland’s compact shape and aggressive pressing in key areas ensuring that shots on target were virtually non-existent in the first half.\n\nSunderland even had their own chances to take the lead when Eleanor Dale’s shot looked set to beat the keeper until a last-second block sent it over the bar. Fenton also went close when her shot ricocheted off the post as she aimed for the bottom corner after the set piece.\n\nThe deadlock was broken shortly after the interval.\n\nA moment of quality from the visitors saw Grace Geyoro slip the ball through to Wassa Sangaré, who timed her run perfectly and slotted past Moloney with composure. It was a cruel blow for Sunderland, who’d defended with such heart and organisation.\n\nHowever, the goal seemed to galvanise the Lasses and Sunderland began to grow into the game, pushing higher up the pitch and enjoying spells of possession. Fenton and Sheva started to find pockets of space, and Brown began to link play more effectively in midfield.\n\nSubstitutions followed as Sunderland looked to inject fresh energy and chase an equaliser.\n\nKaty Watson and Izzy Atkinson replaced Dale and Kitching in order to add some much-needed fresh legs, whilst Scarr moved into a forward position. London City responded with changes of their own, introducing their big guns in Danielle van de Donk, Saki Kumagai, Nikita Parris and Kosovare Asllani in order to regain control.\n\nDespite Sunderland’s increased intent, the visitors’ defence remained resolute.\n\nBalls into the box were swiftly dealt with, and Elene Lete was never truly tested. Sunderland’s best moments came from wide areas, with Kitching and Scarr continuing to drive forward, but the final ball lacked the precision needed to unlock the defence.\n\nSheva did have an opportunity int he dying moments of the game with a cross-shot, but it wasn’t enough to trouble the goalkeeper or to send the fans into frenzied celebrations.\n\nAs the referee blew for full time, the scoreline read 0-1 to London City Lionesses.\n\nOn paper, it was a narrow defeat; in reality, it had been a performance that spoke volumes about Sunderland’s character, determination, and tactical discipline.\n\nTo face such a technically gifted side and limit them to a single goal from a set piece was a remarkable achievement. The back line — led by Roberts and Westrup — was immense throughout, constantly organising, communicating and throwing bodies in front of shots, and Moloney’s calm presence behind them added further assurance.\n\nKitching and Scarr’s defensive contributions were vital, while Fenton and Sheva battled relentlessly in midfield. Though Sunderland didn’t manage to test Lete, their second half response showed bravery and ambition.\n\nThis tie will be remembered not for the scoreline, but for the spirit Sunderland showed. Against one of the strongest sides in the competition, they stood firm, adapted intelligently and fought for every ball. The tactical switch to a 5-2-3 was bold and effective, and the players executed it with discipline and heart.\n\nAlthough the journey ends here, the performance lays a foundation of belief as Sunderland proved they can go toe-to-toe with elite opposition, and that resilience, unity and tactical clarity can bridge gaps in quality.\n\nThe Lasses may have exited the cup, but they did so with heads held high and with the respect of everyone who witnessed their fight.\n\nThe reaction from supporters in the stands and across social media reflected a mixture of pride, frustration and admiration for the sheer resilience Sunderland showed throughout the ninety minutes.\n\nMany fans arrived at Eppleton fully aware of the scale of the challenge ahead, and that sense of realism shaped the tone of the post‑match conversation. Rather than dwelling on the defeat, the overwhelming sentiment was one of respect for a team that refused to fold under relentless pressure.\n\nSupporters were quick to highlight the tactical shift to a 5‑2‑3, acknowledging that it was a necessary adjustment against a London City side packed with technical quality and attacking threat.\n\nFans also praised the discipline with which the players executed the plan, noting how rare it is to see a team maintain concentration so consistently when forced to defend for long spells. The back line in particular drew widespread acclaim, and Roberts and Westrup were spoken about with genuine affection, with supporters describing them as “warriors, leaders, and the heartbeat of the performance”.\n\nSome remarked that the pair seemed to grow stronger the more London City pushed, organising the line with authority and throwing themselves into challenges with a commitment that resonated deeply with the crowd.\n\nThere was also a great deal of admiration for the work rate of players who were asked to operate outside their usual roles.\n\nKitching earned praise for her relentless tracking back and willingness to graft for the team, whilst Scarr received similar recognition, with fans noting how tirelessly she pressed, covered space, and supported the wing‑backs. Supporters appreciated that both players sacrificed their natural attacking instincts for the good of the collective, embodying the spirit that has long defined Sunderland sides across generations.\n\nEven in defeat, fans found encouragement in the way the team responded after going a goal down.\n\nThe shift in momentum during the second half was widely acknowledged, with many supporters commenting that Sunderland grew braver, more assertive and more confident in possession. While the final ball never quite materialised, the intent was there and fans were quick to point out that few teams manage to wrestle back any control against the Lionesses once they fall behind.\n\nThat resilience and refusal to retreat into their shells was something supporters clung to as a sign of progress and character — but of course, there was disappointment too.\n\nSome fans expressed frustration that Sunderland never truly tested Lete, feeling that the team deserved at least one clear chance to reward their defensive heroics. Others lamented the fine margins of cup football, reflecting on how a single lapse or moment of quality can decide a tie even when the overall performance is strong.\n\nBut even these frustrations were tempered by a sense of perspective. Supporters recognised the gulf in resources and squad depth between the two sides, and many commented that to lose by only one goal — and to do so while restricting the Lionesses to so few genuine opportunities — was an achievement in itself.\n\nWhat united the fanbase most was pride — pride in the fight, the discipline and the togetherness — and the applause at full time was extended and heartfelt.\n\nIt wasn’t polite appreciation of a beaten side but genuine acknowledgement of a group of players who’d emptied the tank for the badge. Online, fans echoed that sentiment, describing the performance as “brave”, “resolute”, “full of heart” and “everything you want to see from a Sunderland side”.\n\nThere was also a sense of optimism threaded through the reaction. Supporters spoke about the foundations being laid, the identity being strengthened and the belief that performances like this — even in defeat — can galvanise a squad.\n\nMany pointed out that if Sunderland can defend like that against one of the strongest sides in the competition, they can take confidence into the league and future cup campaigns. The message was clear: this wasn’t a loss that deflated the fanbase — it was one that reinforced their connection to the team.\n\nIn the end, the fan reaction captured the essence of Sunderland Women’s performance: gritty, determined, and full of character.\n\nSupporters left Eppleton knowing their team had given everything and while the cup run ends here, the pride in the performance will linger far longer than the disappointment of the result.\n\nLondon City Lionesses 1 (Geyoro 51’)\n\nSunderland: Moloney, Greenwood, Roberts; Griffiths, Scarr, Dale; Kitching, Brown, Fenton; Sheva, Westrup\n\nSubstitutes: Blench, Paxton, Finn, Cassap, McInnes, Atkinson, Watson, Jones, Blades\n\nLondon City Lionesses: Lete, Fernández, Pattinson; Pérez, Godfrey, Franssi; Roddar, Goodwin, Sangaré; Kennedy, Geyoro\n\nSubstitutes: Orman, Goldie, Corrales, Kumagai, Asllani, Van de Donk, Linari, Parris, Brown",

    "title": "Brian Brobbey Is Sunderland’s Explosive Spearhead!",
    "description": "Brobbey’s influence on this team is growing and he’s regularly giving seasoned top flight defenders a hell of a battle!",
    "fullText": "If you occasionally find yourself pining for the days of the FA Carling Premiership — a time when Nintendo, Northern Rock and Harcros Building Supplies were advertised pitchside, VAR was merely a pipe dream and “low blocks” weren’t part of the footballing vernacular — Brian Brobbey’s display against Crystal Palace on Saturday might well have been right up your street.\n\nSimply put, it was a throwback to an era during which strikers gave as good as they got, where they took their licks but kept coming back for more, and where brute strength and determination often won out.\n\nIn the first instance, it’s important to highlight that after an understandably low-key start to his Sunderland career, Brobbey has been looking better and better with every game he’s played, and the contempt with which he treated the ball as he lashed it past Vicario at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was that of a player whose desire to prove himself in English football is as strong as the force contained within his thigh muscles and his boots.\n\nHere’s a talented footballer given a chance by Sunderland after experiencing some turbulent times at Ajax, and boy, is he determined to make the most of it.\n\nWe’d already seen glimpses of what Brobbey could do if given a chance.\n\nAfter setting up Chemsdine Talbi’s winner against Chelsea, there was a dramatic equaliser against Arsenal, a fine header against Bournemouth and of course that goal against Spurs, but as a complete performance, this was about as impressive as it gets and given the praise that was lavished on Brobbey and Sunderland’s signing of him by former Tottenham manager Martin Jol, it can only draw more positive attention and ensure that his confidence continues to soar.\n\nAgainst Palace, Brobbey was an absolute force of nature.\n\nHe bullied the visiting defence mercilessly, refused to be cowed in the face of little protection from referee Rob Jones, and completed the Sunderland comeback with a sublime finish over Dean Henderson. He was on the receiving end of plenty of rough stuff from the visiting defenders as they struggled to deal with his threat, but he kept coming back for more — the sign of a centre forward who’s certainly up for the fight.\n\nPurists may cry foul and it’s fair to say that his confrontational approach would be sniffed at by many coaches, but in an era during which we often expect strikers to combine silky skills, dead-eye accuracy in front of goal and statistics that keep the analysts happy, there’s something brutally effective and undeniably captivating about Brobbey’s style of play, and this was highlighted to devastating effect against the Eagles.\n\nCricket writer Simon Barnes once said of legendary Australian batsman Steve Waugh that he “wanted to defeat you personally” and in Brobbey’s on-pitch body language, his “no backwards steps” mentality and his fiery competitiveness, I see a striker who relishes every physical duel and every ounce of needle, and for whom getting the better of an opposing defender is a matter of real pride.\n\nWith that in mind, is Brobbey channelling the trauma of his personal strife and using it as a source of motivation every time he steps out onto the pitch?\n\nGiven what he went through and the frankly appalling troubles he endured during his latter days in Amsterdam, you could understand why he’s perhaps being driven by an almost primitive sense of rage, a burning desire to make up for any lost time and to show that the Eredivisie — itself the subject of all manner of cracks about average strikers — does in fact produce centre forwards whose game can be fine-tuned in order to suit the demands of the Premier League.\n\nOne thing is for sure: his popularity among the Sunderland fanbase is growing and it’s easy to see why Régis Le Bris has placed so much trust in him as our first-choice striker. Wilson Isidor remains a superb alternative but at the moment — and with players picked on merit — Brobbey is our spearhead and it’ll take some effort to prise that number nine shirt from his muscular torso.\n\nWe’ve always loved abrasive players who give as good as they get and in this young Dutch marksman, we seem to have signed a centre forward who combines supreme physical attributes with an eye for goal that’s starting to pay dividends on a more frequent basis.\n\nHe’s clearly working very hard. He’s operating in an environment in which players who reach and maintain certain standards will always find favour — and he’s giving seasoned Premier League defenders a hell of a battle every time he lines up in a red and white shirt.\n\nFurthermore, if the goals (and in this case, the strike that sealed victory for the Lads) continue to come, the arguments about the need for Sunderland to sign a “genuine goalscoring striker” will also be rendered moot, and that’ll be no mean feat.\n\nLet’s keep showing him the love — and hopefully he’ll continue to deliver!",

    "fullText": "NFL playoff picks, predictions: Patriots hold off Broncos, Rams upset Seahawks to advance to Super Bowl 60 originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nConference championship weekend will determine who reaches Super Bowl 60 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., on Feb. 8.\n\nDenver and Seattle advanced on divisional playoff weekend.\n\nThe Broncos will host the AFC championship game for the seventh time in franchise history, but the dominant storyline is the loss of Bo Nix, who suffered a broken bone in his right ankle in the 33-30 victory against Buffalo and will be replaced by Jarrett Stidham. New England beat Houston 28-16 in the AFC divisional playoffs behind second-year quarterback Drake Maye and a defense that forced four turnovers.\n\nDenver has beaten the New England Patriots in the AFC championship game in two past meetings.\n\nThe AFC championship game will be at 3 p.m. on CBS.\n\nThe Seahawks hammered the San Francisco 49ers 49-6 in the NFC divisional playoffs. Sam Darnold earned his first playoff victory, and Kenneth Walker III had three TD runs. The Rams survived a 20-17 overtime classic at Chicago in the NFC divisional round, and Matthew Stafford has a chance to get to a second Super Bowl with coach Sean McVay, who is looking for a third appearance.\n\nHere are Sporting News' picks for the AFC and NFC Championship games (odds courtesy of Caesars):\n\nNew England Patriots (-5.5) at Denver Broncos\n\nIt is a fun coaching matchup between Sean Payton and Mike Vrabel, who can take New England to the Super Bowl in his first season.\n\nStidham made two starts with coach Sean Payton in the 2023 season. How much will the Patriots speed up the seventh-year quarterback on his reads? Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud threw four interceptions and took three sacks. The Broncos will have to rely on the running game more – which averaged just 3.2 yards per carry against the Bills. RJ Harvey and Jaleel McLaughlin need to be more effective against a Patriots’ defense that allowed 48 rushing yards against the Texans. New England’s defense that features linebackers Robert Spillane and Christian Elliss.\n\nHow much will Stidham be able to test New England in the passing game? Carlton Davis - who did not have an interception in the regular season – had two picks. The Patriots will take chances in coverage on Stidham, and Denver also has uncertainty at the receiver position. Troy Franklin suffered a hamstring injury in the divisional playoffs, and that leaves Courtland Sutton, Marvin Mims and Lil’Jordan Humphrey at receiver. How much success will the Broncos have on third down in the intermediate range?\n\nBreaking down Broncos' QB depth chart behind Bo Nix\n\nCan the Broncos still win the Super Bowl without Bo Nix?\n\nGet to know new Broncos QB1, Jarrett Stidham\n\nDenver’s defense also will face more pressure to keep this a low-scoring game. Maye will be on the spot, too, especially in his first road playoff start. The Broncos generated five turnovers and three sacks against the Bills, and linebacker Nik Bonitto had a sack and two forced fumbles. There will be opportunities against Maye, who had four fumbles against the Texans, and the pressure has to land. The Patriots can lean on the running game with Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson, and that should help Maye settle in on the road.\n\nMaye has been trustworthy on the road this season, too. He’s 8-0 with an average 273.5 yards, 17 TDs and three interceptions on the road this season. This is Maye’s first start at Empower Field at Mile High, and the Broncos were 9-1 S/U at home this season and 2-0 S/U as a home underdog. It’s still a tough environment, and the Broncos are 6-1 S/U all time at home in the AFC championship game. Pittsburgh beat Denver 34-17 in the 2005 AFC championship game on Jan. 22, 2006.\n\nPatriots defense picks apart Texans to advance to AFC Championship\n\nC.J. Stroud's four first-half INTs doom Texans\n\nWhy Patriots can't afford another sloppy Drake Maye playoff performance\n\nWhere C.J. Stroud's disastrous day ranks among most turnovers in a playoff game\n\nCan Stidham pull a Jeff Hostettler – who led the Giants to a Super Bowl XXV victory after Phil Simms was injured. Hostettler had two regular-season starts before the playoffs. A week might not be enough time for Denver here. It’s just going to be tough to pull this off without the Patriots imploding on the road.\n\nLos Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-2.5)\n\nThe two regular-season matchups were decided by a combined total of three points, including a wild 38-37 overtime thriller on Dec. 18. The NFC West rivals split the regular-season series, and three of the last four meetings at Seattle have gone into overtime.\n\nWalker is coming off a huge game, and he had 11 carries for 100 yards and a TD in the last meeting. The Rams allowed 160 rushing yards against the Bears, so Seattle can be patient with the two-headed rushing attack of Walker and Zach Charbonnet. Jared Verse has to be a difference maker off the edge for Los Angeles.\n\nThat should help Darnold – who finished 51 of 78 (65.4%) for an average of 274.5 yards, two TDs and six interceptions in the two regular-season meetings against the Rams. Jaxon Smith-Njigba had 17 catches for 201 yards and a TD in those two games, and that is the matchup Seattle needs to win consistently in the passing game. Five different Los Angeles players had interceptions in those games, and the Rams intercepted Caleb Williams three times in the divisional playoff win. Turnovers will be key here, especially on the road.\n\nHow swarming Seattle defense is peaking at right time\n\nWatch Rashid Shaheed take opening kickoff for TD\n\nThis is another opportunity for Stafford, who had a 57.1% completion percentage in those two meetings but also did not take a sack. He had 457 yards and three TDs in the last meeting. Will Seattle coach Michael Macdonald choose to dial up the pressure in order to take Stafford out of rhythm with receivers Puka Nacua and Davante Adams? Tight end Cody Parkinson had 10 carries for 90 yards and a TD in two playoff games, too. The Rams also will look to establish the running game with Kyren Williams and Blake Corum. The Seahawks allowed 5.3 yards per carry in their regular-season loss in the Rams and 3.2 yards per carry in the win.\n\nThe Rams were 4-5 S/U on the road, but they are 1-1 ATS as an underdog in the regular season, but they have won S/U as a road favorite each of the last two weeks. Seattle is 8-2 S/U and 6-4 ATS at home. The Seahawks are 3-0 S/U at home in the NFC championship game.\n\nIt's shaping up to be another instant classic between these rivals, but the Rams had a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter in that last meeting and they have survived two tough road games. Does Stafford have one more road victory in him? It's hard not to trust the MVP-caliber quarterback in this matchup.\n\nRams fend off Bears' comeback attempt to advance to NFC Championship\n\nCaleb Williams overtime interception dooms Bears\n\nWatch Caleb Williams uncork spectacular TD pass to Cole Kmet to force overtime",

    "fullText": "Morocco head coach Walid Regragui called Senegal counter-part Pape Thiaw “shameful” after he led his players off the pitch in protest during a chaotic end to the Africa Cup of Nations final.\n\nSenegal were angered by a controversial decision to award Morocco a penalty in the final minute of stoppage time and, fuelled by a sense of injustice, Thiaw called on his players to return to the dressing room.\n\nAfter a delay of around 15 minutes, talisman Sadio Mane, who had remained on the field, convinced his team-mates to return to the pitch, where Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy saved Brahim Diaz’s ‘Panenka’ penalty.\n\nSenegal went on to win their second Africa Cup of Nations title thanks to Pape Gueye’s goal in extra time, but the final and tournament was overshadowed by the chaos.\n\n“The image we’ve given of Africa is shameful,” Regragui said during his post-match press conference. “A coach who asks his players to leave the field... What Pape did does not honour Africa. He wasn’t classy. But he is a champion, so he can say whatever he wants.”\n\nSenegal are likely to face a punishment for their actions, including their head coach. Thiaw was jeered as he entered his post-match press conference in Rabat, but later accepted that Senegal had made the wrong decision.\n\n“I apologise for football,” Thiaw said in a later interview with BeIN Sport. “After reflection, I had them come back. Sometimes, you can react in the heat of the moment. We shouldn't have done it but it's done and now we present our apologies to football.”",

    "fullText": "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano is the man who never sleeps, and he put out his latest info on Jeremy Jacquet to Chelsea over night.\n\nIt’s the big Chelsea transfer story of this January window so far, with The Blues looking to get a deal tied up to sign the rising French centre back from Rennes this month.\n\nRomano had the latest out on what is happening with transfer negotiations, with Chelsea’s directors out in France now looking to get a fee agreed with the French side.\n\nJeremy Jacquet in action for Rennes in Ligue 1.\n\nIn quotes picked up on X, Romano said:\n\n“Not an easy negotiation between Chelsea and Rennes for Jacquet. Rennes want really important money as they believe he’s one of the best young defenders in the world. New contacts this week to try get closer to final price and structure. Rosenior approved it.\n\n“Chelsea owners and directors are involved working on the Jacquet deal. Rennes want to go over the Doku sale, which means their request is 70m euros.”\n\nThat equates to around £60.7m. Seems like a lot of money. But I believe Chelsea will be paying slightly less than that and will pay a lower base fee and have a favourable structure for them.\n\nFormer Chelsea player and manager Ruud Gullit has been questioning whether Chelsea is the right club for the development of fellow Dutch man Jorrel Hato, in some rare comments from the former midfield player.\n\nAnd a reminder as we head back to the main story for the this one. Chelsea have already agreed personal terms with Jeremy Jacquet ahead of trying to agree the fee. So that side is all done and dusted.",

    "description": "Deandre Ayton goes a perfect 10-for-10 with 25 points in the Lakers' 110-93 win over the Raptors on Sunday",
    "fullText": "The Lakers are back in the win column after taking down the Toronto Raptors 110-93 at Crypto.com Arena on Thursday behind a perfect night from their starting center, Deandre Ayton.\n\nAyton became the third player in franchise history to be perfect from the field with at least 10 shot attempts, finishing the game with 25 points and 13 rebounds on 10-for-10 shooting. He joined Wilt Chamberlain (March 11, 1969) and Mitch Kupchak (Nov. 20, 1981) as the only Lakers to do so.\n\nIt was the third time this season Ayton finished perfect from the field and with double-digit scoring.\n\nAlong with the Lakers' starting bigman's best performance of the season, Luka Dončić and LeBron James also finished with over 20 points in the Lakers' 25th win of the season.\n\nDončić made his return to the lineup after being sidelined against the Trail Blazers on Saturday, finishing with 25 points and seven assists. James played in both back-to-back games for the second time this season and in a row, finishing with 24 points, seven rebounds and four assists.\n\nAfter producing solid minutes in the road loss in Portland, Drew Timme earned more minutes from coach JJ Redick and even got words of approval from James himself after the game, resulting in the sophomore getting some early minutes against the Raptors.\n\nRedick started Timme to begin the second quarter after the Lakers struggled to a slow start, trailing 30-23 at the end of the first quarter. Redick went with a big lineup that included Marcus Smart, Jarred Vanderbilt, Drew Timme, James and Ayton to begin the second.\n\nThat group outmatched and even outperformed Toronto, outscoring them 15-3. The Lakers rode that momentum for the rest of the quarter, but Raptors big man Sandro Mamukelashvili, yes, him, gave the Lakers fits, keeping the score close. Mamukelashvili finished with 20 points on eight-of-12 shooting.\n\nThe Lakers ended the first half with a one-point lead after Dončić beat the horn with his signature patented step-back 3 that got the sold-out crowd buzzing. After a back-and-forth third-quarter start, the Lakers slowly pulled away with the score.\n\nTheir efficiency in the third kept them riding the momentum, hitting five of their 10 attempts from 3 and eight of 12 from two. The Lakers' push had them outscore the Raptors 32-26 in the third and finally put them away with a 23-13 score in the fourth.\n\nThe Lakers improved to 25-16  and 12-8 at home as they still remain in the sixth spot in the West.\n\nThey concluded five games in six days but will now go on an eight-game road trip, starting in Denver on Tuesday.",

    "description": "Under Michael Carrick, Old Trafford will have to go through a process of deAmorimisation – but there is a lopsided look to a squad that requires another rebuilding job",
    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola’s 55th birthday fell on Sunday. It may not be his happiest. The present could come in the form of Marc Guehi, when he signs. But if Guardiola’s mood may be altered by perhaps the most comprehensive derby defeat he has suffered in almost a decade in Manchester, he might have been facing another manager to celebrate a birthday in January. A year earlier, Ruben Amorim remarked that, after two months at Manchester United, he felt 50, not 40.\n\nTwo weeks after leaving, maybe Amorim is fresher-faced and youthful again. But he did win his first Manchester derby in charge. So, 13 months later, did Michael Carrick. Yet a bad day for Guardiola could also be seen as a similarly damaging one for Amorim.\n\nCarrick’s superlative start was in part an indictment of the man who was supposed to be United’s answer to Guardiola. Much that has happened in the last fortnight is that the previous interim Darren Fletcher started by switching to a back four. He conjured three goals in two games from Benjamin Sesko, after two in 17 for Amorim. Fletcher, though, did not win.\n\nCarrick did. With a back four, with flying wingers, with Bruno Fernandes as a No 10, with Kobbie Mainoo in the midfield. His choices showed a decisiveness, and the way his gameplan was executed reflected well on a coaching staff drawn from United, England and Middlesbrough. Yet the flippant explanation may be simply that Carrick did the opposite of everything Amorim did. There was a fast start, a second half that was won, a clean sheet: this was rarely the Amorim way.\n\nBut the same 11 players could have been configured in Amorim’s beloved 3-4-3. And yet, of the 10 outfield players Carrick selected, only one had really occupied the same position under Amorim this season: Casemiro as one of two central midfielders. Mainoo, after all, had not been granted a Premier League start, Lisandro Martinez and Harry Maguire had tended to play in back threes, while there were no full-backs or wingers.\n\nIt was hard to escape the sense United had been held back by dogmatic decision-making. Mainoo is an incomplete midfielder, and not a defensive one, but he is also a far better one than Amorim ever seemed to acknowledge. But for regime change, Mainoo may have been eyeing a loan move this month. Amorim deemed him Fernandes’ understudy for the No 8 position: but the captain has been the most consistently creative player in the division. His through ball for Bryan Mbeumo’s goal constituted an argument for using him as a No 10.\n\nThere is a temptation to see much of the match as a reaction to Amorim’s departure. United looked liberated. There was a bond between players and crowd which, while the match-going public never turned on Amorim, showed the public felt happier. “One important thing that Michael Carrick said was ‘use the energy of the people’,” said Martinez.\n\nA reason why United tend have an excellent record in the short-term reigns of their former players turned temporary managers is that they can seem glad to see the supposed permanent choice gone. And if that may reflect badly on the players who can deliver more for an interim, whatever their official title, than the man who was supposed to be in charge for years, it can sometimes seem a return to reason.\n\nBut if United are in a process of deAmorimisation, it comes with complications. He inherited a squad unsuited to 3-4-3 and remodelled it. Now it is imbalanced to play 4-2-3-1. Instead of a model of two players for every position, there is a lopsided look. There are three whose best position is No 10, in Fernandes, Cunha and Mason Mount, but only three who prefer to be in the centre of midfield, in Casemiro, Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte. United always intended to target midfielders this summer. They look still shorter of them now.\n\nBut after Amorim alienated and exiled Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, there is no real specialist left winger in this squad; or if Patrick Dorgu counts, after his terrific derby display, then there is a lone out-and-out left-back. All of which could mean United lack players for key roles later in the season.\n\nMeanwhile, there was always the problem that Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo could both covet the same spot, when each is clearly among United’s finest players. Amorim’s answer was often to play them as right wing-back and No 10; Carrick used them as winger and striker.\n\nPart of Amorim’s legacy was to add to United’s rebuilding job in the summer; as became clear of late, director of football Jason Wilcox’s preference was for a back four. That attempt to deAmorimise even while he was still in a job may have led to his departure.\n\nCarrick’s Premier League record in charge of United, spread across two spells, is wins over Arsenal and City, with a draw at Chelsea. It is Arsenal next, so he must hope to extend his run as the scourge of the elite. But Amorim’s greater failings came against the mid-table and bottom-half teams. United’s February and March fixture list is full of such sides. So the test, once again, will be to prove the opposite of Amorim then.",

    "fullText": "Britain's Francesca Jones sobbed loudly on court as injury wrecked her hopes of a first main-draw win at the Australian Open.\n\nEarly retirements became a theme on day two in Melbourne, with men's eighth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime and qualifier Marina Stakusic - who was taken off court in a wheelchair - both forced to retire after cramping.\n\nBritish number three Jones struggled to move from the early stages of her first-round match against Polish qualifier Linda Klimovicova on Monday.\n\nThe distraught 25-year-old valiantly tried to continue but ultimately quit when trailing 6-2 3-2.\n\nA groin injury had forced Jones out of a match at last week's Auckland International, but it was a glute problem that led to her retirement against Klimovicova.\n\nShe took a medical timeout at the end of the first set and received further attention from the physio after the third and fifth games of the second set.\n\nThe world number 71 was broken to love in the fifth game and was left in tears while receiving treatment.\n\nAfter getting back to her feet, Jones signalled to Klimovicova that she could not continue.\n\nRiverside walk & nap prepare Raducanu for dominant win\n\nThere was a sombre atmosphere on the court, with the crowd applauding sympathetically as Jones limped off with a towel covering her head.\n\nJones, who has a rare genetic condition which means she plays with a modified grip, has defied the odds to compete among the elite.\n\nAfter a difficult 2024 where she found herself outside the world's top 150, Jones planned to retire in 2025 if her ranking did not improve.\n\nInstead, she enjoyed a life-changing season that pumped new energy into her tennis career.\n\nJones had received direct entry into the Australian Open main draw for the first time, but this marked a sad exit to what had been a proud moment.\n\nThe heat hit 30C in Melbourne but it is common for players to compete in much higher temperatures. By mid-afternoon the Australian Open's heat stress scale, read 1.4 out of five - deemed 'temperature playing conditions'.\n\nCanada's Auger-Aliassime came into the Australian Open as part of the group tipped to challenge clear favourites Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner for the men's title.\n\nThe 25-year-old surged into the world's top five after finishing last season with a flourish, including a run to the US Open semi-finals.\n\nBut he fell at the first hurdle in Melbourne despite taking the opening set against Portugal's Nuno Borges.\n\n\"I can't recall ever in my life this [happening this] early in a tournament, this early in a match,\" Auger-Aliassime said after quitting when trailing 3-6 6-4 6-4.\n\n\"I don't have all the answers now.\"\n\nCramping was the root of the dramatic scenes involving Stakusic.\n\nThe Canadian world number 127 went down in the third set of her first-round match against Australia's Priscilla Hon.\n\nA rubdown with ice did not improve the spasm in Stakusic's leg, forcing her to quit when trailing 1-6 6-4 5-3.\n\nMedical staff and Hon helped her in to a wheelchair before the 21-year-old was taken off court.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "India’s big four outsourcers – HCL, Infosys, TCS and Wipro – have essentially stopped hiring, perhaps coinciding with their increased use of AI to power their practices.\n\nThe four companies have all announced quarterly results in the last ten days and appear to be in decent health. HCL reported $3.8 billion revenue, up 7.4 percent year over year. Infosys pulled in $5.1 billion, up 1.7 percent year over year. TCS revenue of $7.5 billion represented a three percent increase. Wipro’s $2.6 billion revenue represented a 5.5 percent year over year improvement.\n\nIndia’s top tech companies often hire more than 10,000 people a quarter, a rate of recruitment that more-than offsets attrition and sees their headcounts rise substantially. Wipro increased its payroll by 6,500 people last quarter and Infosys hired 5,000 more – muted growth by their standards – while TCS and HCL went backward by 11,000 and 261 people respectively.\n\nOver the last year, the four companies added just 3,910 staff, an unusually slow rate of hiring.\n\nPerhaps coincidentally, all four companies told investors they’re using more AI to deliver services for clients, either by adopting the technology to streamline their own work or by adding it to the tools they deliver to customers. Infosys has gone meta with its efforts, by creating a tool that uses AI to create Global Capability Centers, the company’s term for offshored and/or outsourced operations it runs for clients in India, that use AI to improve customers’ operations.\n\nAll also report that clients are hungry for AI expertise, so they can put the technology to work streamlining their operations. As you would expect, on earnings calls the outsourcers’ execs reached for metrics to describe their success with AI. For HCL that was pointing to 60 of its priority customers adopting one of its AI services. At TCS, the trophy win was using AI to accelerate the pace of software builds for a major client. Wipro is chuffed about the rate of adoption for its AI-infused operations tools WINGS and WEGA.\n\nThe four companies are all hiring people with AI skills as fast as they can find them while also training senior staff who are yet to wrap their heads around the tech, a new twist on the services industry’s balancing act of trying to keep margins high by having inexperienced and low-salaried juniors handle much client work after high-cost seniors lead with consultancy.\n\nInvestors weren’t spooked by what they heard, with the four companies’ share prices steady – other than Infosys, which popped five percent. ®",

    "fullText": "The Independent has some terrifying news: Apparently the opening line to Beowulf has been misinterpreted for 200 years? Hwæt:\n\nIt is perhaps the most important word in one of the greatest and most famous sentences in the history of the English language.\n\nYet for more than two centuries “hwæt” has been misrepresented as an attention-grabbing latter-day “yo!” designed to capture the interest of its intended Anglo-Saxon audience urging them to sit down and listen up to the exploits of the heroic monster-slayer Beowulf.\n\nAccording to an academic at the University of Manchester, however, the accepted definition of the opening line of the epic poem – including the most recent translation by the late Seamus Heaney - has been subtly wide of the mark.\n\nIn a new paper due to be published this month Dr George Walkden argues that the use of the interrogative pronoun “hwæt” (rhymes with cat) means the first line is not a standalone command but informs the wider exclamatory nature of the sentence which was written by an unknown poet between 1,200 and 1,300 years ago.\n\nAccording to the historical linguist, rather than reading: “Listen! We have heard of the might of the kings” the Old English of “Hwæt! We Gar-Dena in gear-dagum, þeod-cyninga, þrym gefrunon, hu ða æþelingas ellen fremedon!” should instead be understood as: “How we have heard of the might of the kings.”\n\nDr Walkden said his conclusion – based on the positioning of the word relative to the verb within 141 other clauses studied – would put him at odds with the conventional wisdom on the subject.\n\n“I’d like to say that the interpretation I have put forward should be taken into a count by future translations,” he said.\n\nThe new translation could also cast light on those that might have been listening in the flickering light of the ancient campfires to the daring tale.\n\n“It shows that perhaps the Anglo-Saxon audiences were better behaved than we thought because it doesn’t say `Oi you, listen to this!’” Perhaps they were more appreciative,” he added.\n\nThe confusion is believed to date back to Jakob Grimm, one of the Grimm Brothers, who wrote in 1837 that “hwæt” was a “pure interjection”.\n\nSince then it has variously been translated as “What ho!” “Hear me!” “Attend!” “Indeed!” and more recently “So!” by Seamus Heaney in 2000.\n\nThis is despite the research suggesting that the Anglo Saxons made little use of the exclamation mark or indeed much other punctuation beyond the full stop or the occasional semi colon.\n\nFind the full story at The Independent.",

    "title": "The War on Drugs Is Why Your Bus Never Showed Up",
    "description": "Your bus didn’t show up because someone who could have driven it wasn’t allowed to take the job. Not because they couldn’t do it safely. Because they smoked weed two weeks ago.",
    "fullText": "You’re standing at the bus stop. The app said the bus would arrive in 3 minutes. Then 5 minutes. Then it just disappears from the tracker entirely. No bus. No explanation. Just another 45-minute wait for the next one, assuming that one actually shows up.\n\nThis isn’t a story about infrastructure or funding.\n\nIt’s about United States federal drug policy.\n\nMore than 90% of transit agencies across the US can’t hire enough bus drivers.1 Not because people don’t want the jobs—because federal law won’t let them take them.\n\nIn Baltimore, one in five buses don’t complete their runs.2 LA Metro is short 600 drivers and cancels 10% of scheduled service every single day.3 Miami postponed its entire bus network redesign because it couldn’t find people to drive the new routes.4\n\nBefore the pandemic, LA Metro missed 1-2% of scheduled trips. Now it’s 10%. That’s not a marginal decline—that’s system failure.\n\nHere’s the problem: Under federal law (49 CFR Part 382), anyone with a commercial driver’s license must pass DOT drug tests that include marijuana.5 No exceptions.\n\nThis applies to every transit bus operator in America, regardless of what state law says about marijuana.\n\nNotably, these mandates do not apply to Uber or Lyft drivers.\n\nThe tests don’t measure impairment–they detect THC metabolites that linger for weeks after use.\n\nSomeone who smoked on Saturday tests positive on Monday despite being completely sober.\n\nOne positive test goes into a federal database and effectively ends your driving career.\n\nAccording to 2024 federal data, 44 million American adults used marijuana in the past month.6\n\nThat’s 15% of the US adult population—-the exact population transit agencies need to recruit from.\n\nTransit agencies are desperate to hire. They’re offering bonuses, raising wages, running recruitment campaigns.\n\nBut federal policy immediately disqualifies 15-25% of otherwise qualified applicants before they even walk in the door.\n\nThink about that math. There are 159,000 transit bus operators nationwide.7\n\nAgencies report shortages of 600-800 drivers at single large systems.\n\nThe workforce shortage is measured in thousands and federal policy is excluding millions.\n\nIn 24 states, recreational marijuana is already legal. In 38 states, medical marijuana is legal.8\n\nYou can walk into a licensed dispensary in Los Angeles, Denver, or Seattle, buy marijuana legally, use it at home on the weekend, and be permanently barred from driving a bus on Monday.\n\nEight states have passed laws explicitly protecting workers from employment discrimination based on off-duty marijuana use.9\n\nBut all those protections include an exception: they don’t apply if federal law requires drug testing. The state laws can’t override DOT regulations.\n\nSo someone in California (where marijuana has been legal for years) can be fired from a bus driving job or never hired in the first place for doing something that’s completely legal under state law.\n\nNot because they’re impaired at work, but because they tested positive for something they did on their own time that violated no state law.\n\nWhen agencies can’t hire drivers, the consequences are immediate and measurable:\n\nBuses don’t show up. Before the shortage, major agencies completed 98-99% of scheduled runs. Now many are at 85-90%. Each missed bus means missed connections, doubled wait times, and overcrowded buses when one finally arrives.\n\nRoutes get cut. Rhode Island cut service on 21 routes citing driver shortages.10 Pittsburgh reduced scheduled service by 4%.11 These aren’t strategic decisions—they’re forced reductions because there aren’t enough people to drive the buses that already exist.\n\nRiders give up. When you can’t trust the bus to show up, you stop planning your life around it. You buy a car. You take an Uber. You move closer to work. The system loses riders not because of a single bad trip, but because unreliability makes it unusable.\n\nRemoving marijuana from CDL drug testing wouldn’t cost transit agencies anything. They don’t need to buy new buses, build new facilities, or hire more mechanics. They just need access to the millions of workers federal law currently bars them from hiring.\n\nRight now agencies are spending thousands per driver on signing bonuses and retention incentives—band-aids that don’t fix the underlying problem.\n\nMeanwhile, 44 million Americans who could do the job are legally prohibited from applying.\n\nThe current policy forces agencies to compete for the 75-85% of adults who haven’t used marijuana recently, while excluding a massive pool of qualified workers for no reason related to job performance or safety.\n\nThe tests don’t measure safety. They measure past use.\n\nSomeone can be stone sober, fully capable of safely operating a bus, and still fail a marijuana test from use days or weeks earlier.\n\nMeanwhile, the same test won’t catch someone who’s exhausted, hungover, on cold medicine, or impaired by any number of other factors that actually affect driving.\n\nNew York’s Department of Labor has explicitly said employers can’t test for marijuana because the tests don’t measure workplace impairment—they measure past behavior that has no bearing on current job performance.12\n\nIf safety is the concern, there are performance-based impairment tests that measure actual ability to do the job, regardless of cause.\n\nThose tests would catch impairment from any \n\nCurrent marijuana testing doesn’t do that.\n\nFederal marijuana policy treats cannabis like heroin—Schedule I, high potential for abuse, no medical value. That classification is why transit agencies must test for it. It’s also completely divorced from reality, medical research, and the laws in 38 states.\n\nThe fix is simple: remove marijuana from DOT drug testing requirements. That’s it. Transit agencies could immediately start hiring from a pool of 44 million additional workers. Service would improve overnight at zero cost to taxpayers.\n\nThe buses exist. The routes are planned. The riders are waiting.\n\nThe only thing missing is drivers—and federal drug policy is the reason they can’t get hired.\n\nYour bus didn’t show up because someone who could have driven it wasn’t allowed to take the job.\n\nNot because they couldn’t do it safely.\n\nBecause they smoked weed two weeks ago.\n\nAmerican Public Transportation Association, Transit Workforce Shortage Study (2022) ↩\n\nGoverning, A Bus Driver Shortage Threatens Transit (October 31, 2022) ↩\n\nStreetsblog LA, Missed Runs and Crowded Buses: Metro Falls Short of Restoring Full Pre-COVID Transit Service (October 1, 2021) ↩\n\nTransitCenter, Bus Operators in Crisis (2022) ↩\n\nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, 49 CFR Part 382 - Controlled Substances and Alcohol Use and Testing ↩\n\nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Key Substance Use and Mental Health Indicators in the United States: Results from the 2024 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2024) ↩\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment and Wages: Bus Drivers, Transit and Intercity (May 2024) ↩\n\nMarijuana Policy Project, Cannabis Legalization and Employment Protections ↩\n\nGovDocs, Marijuana Laws by State: Employee Protections (August 20, 2025) ↩\n\nGoverning, A Bus Driver Shortage Threatens Transit (October 31, 2022) ↩\n\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette, Port Authority to reduce service because of driver shortage (May 19, 2022) ↩\n\nAnderson Kill, New York Bans Employers From Testing (Most) Employees And Job Applicants For Marijuana (June 16, 2025) ↩",

    "description": "The Minnesota governor signed a police reform package that included tightening the criteria for the permitted use of deadly force by peace officers.",
    "fullText": "The Jan. 7, 2026, killing of Renee Nicole Good by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis sparked a wave of online claims about what the law allows when officers confront moving vehicles. Text shared in multiple social media posts appeared to cite Minnesota Statutes Section 609.066 as justification for the killing, claiming that accelerating a car toward an officer automatically \"creates an immediate, life-threatening danger\" and the officer \"doesn't need to wait until impact\" before using deadly force.\n\nMinnesota Statutes Section 609.066 is a real law that outlines when officers can use deadly force, but it doesn't mention cars. Rather than a direct quote from the law, the text shared in social media posts appeared to be an internet user's interpretation of the law in the context of the Good killing. We've reached out to the user who appeared to have first shared the text to ask whether they meant it as commentary or intended to suggest that the law literally contained this language.\n\nSome posts that shared the text also claimed Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz had signed the law into effect. Walz did, in 2020, sign a police reform package that included tightening the criteria for the use of deadly force outlined in Section 609.066, but he did not create the law, which has been in effect since 1978.\n\nSection 609.066 specifically concerns Minnesota peace officers. Because the officer who shot Good is a federal agent, the Minnesota peace officer statute does not apply to his actions.\n\nThe Jan. 7, 2026, killing of Renee Nicole Good in her car by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis sparked a wave of online claims about what the law allows when officers confront moving vehicles after federal authorities said the agent fatally shot Good, who was in her car, in an act of self-defense.\n\nIn the days that followed the shooting, one widely shared piece of text appeared to cite Minnesota Statutes Section 609.066 as justification for the killing. According to the posts, that law asserts that if a driver accelerates toward an officer standing in front of a car, that automatically creates an \"immediate, life-threatening danger\" and the officer \"doesn't need to wait until impact\" before using deadly force.\n\nOne X post (archived) making the claim that the officer acted legally under Minnesota law read:\n\n🚨Minnesota Statutes § 609.066\nIf a driver accelerates toward an officer standing in front of the vehicle, this creates an immediate, life-threatening danger.\n\nThe officer doesn't need to wait until impact; they can act based on the apparent intent and proximity.\n\nThe purported law spread across social media platforms, including Instagram, TikTok, X and Facebook, with some users posting the text in comment threads under news coverage about the shooting.\n\nSome versions paired the same text with an additional claim that it was \"signed into law by Governor Tim Walz on July 23, 2020,\" after \"a special legislative session.\"\n\nHowever, the alleged paragraph was not a direct quote from Minnesota Statutes Section 609.066. The real statute sets a case-by-case standard requiring an objectively reasonable belief, based on the totality of the circumstances, that deadly force is necessary. It doesn't directly address the scenario of a car driving toward an officer — in other words, the text shared in social media posts appeared to be an internet user's interpretation of the law in the context of Good's killing.\n\nMoreover, while Walz did, on July 23, 2020, sign a police reform package that amended Minnesota's existing use-of-force laws, those changes did not add the wording being shared online.\n\nFinally, the law mentioned in the post was a state law — it wouldn't govern a federal agent such as the ICE officer who shot Good.\n\nThe claim circulated in two main versions. The first was as a legal-sounding passage presented as either a quote or a summary of Minnesota Statutes Section 609.066 and the second version claimed the \"bill was signed into law by Governor Tim Walz on July 23, 2020.\"\n\nThe earliest instance of the text we found dates to Jan. 7, 2026, when the X account @ScummyMummy511 posted it along with an image seeming to show Good's car about to hit the officer.\n\nAs we previously reported, the user admitted the image featured in the post was generated using artificial intelligence. While federal officials described the shooting as self-defense and said Good used her vehicle to strike or threaten an ICE agent, multiple independent analyses of the available video found the SUV's front wheels turned to the right as it began moving forward and the shots were fired as the vehicle moved past the agent.\n\nThe earliest example we found linking the claim to Walz's signature was a Facebook post by Eric Chance Stone (archived). The account's description read, \"Destroyer of False Narratives.\" Other users shared the same text, often as a screenshot of that post.\n\nWe contacted both users to ask for the source of their information and whether they meant the posts as commentary rather than a literal reflection of Minnesota law, and we'll update this article if they respond. It's worth noting that the @ScummyMummy511 X user's account had a label reading \"Parody account\"; it was unclear whether they meant the text in the post satirically.\n\nThe wording that spread across social media posts does not appear in Minnesota law.\n\nSection 609.066 of the Minnesota Statutes, titled \"Authorized use of deadly force by peace officers,\" defines \"deadly force\" as force used to cause, or that creates a substantial risk of causing, death or great bodily harm, and it treats the intentional discharge of a firearm \"at a vehicle in which another person is believed to be\" as deadly force.\n\nHowever, the statute doesn't literally say that a vehicle moving toward an officer automatically makes deadly force lawful, like the paragraph shared on social media suggests. Rather, it states the use of deadly force is justified only if an objectively reasonable officer would believe it is necessary to protect against death or great bodily harm, emphasizing the \"totality of the circumstances.\"\n\nSubdivision 2 of Minnesota Statutes Section 609.066, titled \"Use of deadly force,\" states in full:\n\n(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 609.06 or 609.065, the use of deadly force by a peace officer in the line of duty is justified only if an objectively reasonable officer would believe, based on the totality of the circumstances known to the officer at the time and without the benefit of hindsight, that such force is necessary:\n\n(1) to protect the peace officer or another from death or great bodily harm, provided that the threat:\n\n(i) can be articulated with specificity;\n\n(ii) is reasonably likely to occur absent action by the law enforcement officer; and\n\n(iii) must be addressed through the use of deadly force without unreasonable delay; or\n\n(2) to effect the arrest or capture, or prevent the escape, of a person whom the peace officer knows or has reasonable grounds to believe has committed or attempted to commit a felony and the officer reasonably believes that the person will cause death or great bodily harm to another person under the threat criteria in clause (1), items (i) to (iii), unless immediately apprehended.\n\n(b) A peace officer shall not use deadly force against a person based on the danger the person poses to self if an objectively reasonable officer would believe, based on the totality of the circumstances known to the officer at the time and without the benefit of hindsight, that the person does not pose a threat of death or great bodily harm to the peace officer or to another under the threat criteria in paragraph (a), clause (1), items (i) to (iii).\n\nMoreover, Minnesota Statutes Section 609.066 governs the use of deadly force by Minnesota peace officers. Minnesota's Peace Officer Standards & Training Board notes it regulates Minnesota peace officers, but \"does not license or regulate standards for federal officers\" such as U.S. Marshals, FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration agents, Border Patrol \"or others employed by the federal government.\" In other words, the quoted law wouldn't be the rule governing an ICE agent such as the federal officer who killed Good.\n\nFinally, Walz did sign a real police reform package on July 23, 2020 — the Minnesota Police Accountability Act. Among other changes, the law amended Minnesota Statute Section 609.066, Subdivision 2 (\"Use of deadly force\"), first passed in 1978, tightening the standard to emphasize that deadly force is justified only when an \"objectively reasonable\" officer would believe it is necessary, based on the totality of the circumstances and without the benefit of hindsight, and adding specific threat criteria. Those revisions took effect March 1, 2021.\n\nA screenshot showing how the text changed is embedded below:\n\nTherefore, the reform didn't insert the phrasing shared in the posts. It revised Section 609.066 to stress an objectively reasonable standard based on the totality of the circumstances and added specific threat criteria — a framework that could apply some vehicle-related cases, although the law doesn't directly mention that scenario.\n\nFor further reading, Snopes has investigated many rumors involving Good's death, including a claim that video showed a federal officer defacing a memorial to her.\n\n\"Anger and Outrage Spills onto Minneapolis Streets after ICE Officer's Fatal Shooting of Renee Good.\" AP News, 8 Jan. 2026, https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-immigration-enforcement-crackdown-woman-shot-5158ce0838305b491c95db97b970cd03.\n\nChapter 1 - MN Laws. https://www.revisor.mn.gov/laws/2020/2/1/#laws.0.9.0:~:text=Sec.%2010.,March%201%2C%202021.

    "title": "Researchers uncover shocking new use for cocoa beans that could affect entire planet — and it has nothing to do with chocolate",
    "description": "Biochar could potentially capture a few billion tons of environmentally damaging gases every year.",
    "fullText": "A novel way to counter climate change is taking place in the German port city of Hamburg.\n\nIt's a process that begins with cocoa bean shells going in one end of a factory and coming out as a black powder called biochar, which is doing its part to slow climate change.\n\nBiochar is a black powder also known as \"black gold,\" and it's produced by — in this case — heating cocoa husks in a room that has no oxygen to a temperature of 1,112 degrees Fahrenheit, according to Phys.org. Biochar producers can also use other organic wastes as raw materials.\n\nThe process prevents plant-warming toxic gases from entering the atmosphere, and the final product can be turned into fertilizer or an ingredient for concrete that is environmentally friendlier than traditional concrete, per Phys.org.\n\nBiochar captures the carbon dioxide present in the husks of the cocoa shells from the European plant mentioned above, and this method can be implemented by any other facility.\n\nIf the cocoa shells were discarded conventionally, the carbon within the unused byproduct would be released into the atmosphere during its decomposition.\n\nRather than following the usual disposal method, where the carbon within the unused cocoa shells would be released into the atmosphere, which heats up the planet, it is instead stored in the biochar for a very long time.\n\nDavid Houben, an environmental scientist at the UniLaSalle Institute in France, told Phys.org that the biochar could hold onto the planet-warming gas for centuries.\n\nThe United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says that biochar could potentially capture billions of tons of the environmentally damaging gases released by our species every year.\n\nThis is important because human activities, such as electricity production and transportation, spew around 77 billion tons of planet-warming gases into the atmosphere each year. So far, this warming has triggered an increase in heatwaves, floods, droughts, and forest fires over the past few decades.\n\nSome experts believe implementing renewable energy to reduce the amount of planet-warming emissions into the atmosphere isn't enough and that it may already be too late to prevent the most damaging effects of a warming planet.\n\nThat's why carbon sequestration, or the process of removing the planet-warming gases we've already injected into the atmosphere, is considered so important by many climate experts, and the use of biochar does exactly that.\n\nHowever, the production of biochar is still difficult to scale up to the levels where it could actually slow the overheating of the planet.\n\n\"To ensure the system stores more carbon than it produces, everything needs to be done locally, with little or no transport. Otherwise it makes no sense,\" Houben, the environmental scientist, told Phys.org.\n\nHowever, even though challenges remain, the number of biochar initiatives is increasing rapidly. As reported by Phys.org, the production of biochar is expected to nearly double this year compared to last year.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for easy tips to save more, waste less, and help yourself while helping the planet.",

    "fullText": "Designing a Formula 1 engine has helped Ford gain the edge against Chinese cars, Ford's CEO Jim Farley said.\n\nFord announced in 2023 that it would supply Oracle Red Bull Racing with its engines from 2026. On Friday, Red Bull unveiled its car for the 2026 Formula 1 season, powered by the Red Bull Ford Powertrains engine.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg published on Sunday, Farley was asked how developing the engine has helped him deliver better value for his customers.\n\n\"It's a long list, but I would say the real signature for me is really the software — the control software for the hybrid system, predictive failure components,\" Farley said.\n\nAnd designing better software is a key step to beating Chinese cars, he said.\n\n\"These are the essence of the new software-defined vehicle globally to beat China, and they are really good,\" he added. \"We need these capabilities from Formula 1, and we can put them right in the Transit van.\"\n\nWorking on the F1 engine with Red Bull has helped Ford understand LLMs and predict component failures, which can benefit both Red Bull driver Max Verstappen and Ford's customers.\n\nThis is not Ford's first foray into F1. It supplied engines for the race from 1967 until 2004.\n\nFarley has, on several occasions, gushed about the tech capabilities of China's automobiles. In October 2024, he said he had been driving an EV from the Chinese tech giant Xiaomi for half a year and didn't want to give it up.\n\nAnd in July, speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Farley said, \"They have far superior in-vehicle technology,\" citing Xiaomi's phone-to-car pairing capabilities.\n\nChinese automobile companies, particularly EV makers, have gone all in on smart technology in recent years. An executive of CATL, a Chinese EV battery manufacturer, said during the World Economic Forum last year that China's automakers were retiring the traditional term \"EVs\" in favor of \"EIVs,\" or electric intelligent vehicles.\n\nAnd after the Chinese AI company DeepSeek launched its R1 model last year, major automakers like BYD, Geely, and Great Wall Motor said they would integrate it into their cars.",

    "description": "Harvey's CEO reveals the demo tactic that helped him win early customers for his legal AI startup: Going straight at lawyers' arguments.",
    "fullText": "Harvey's CEO says his earliest demos worked because they went straight for lawyers' arguments.\n\nWinston Weinberg said in an episode of the \"Sequoia Capital\" podcast published Thursday that once he got lawyers on a call to demo his legal AI tool, he knew he had only seconds to grab their attention.\n\nInstead of walking through features, the cofounder and chief executive of the legal AI startup pulled publicly available court filings that the lawyers had written and prompted Harvey to critique them.\n\n\"I would try to come up with prompts that were like, 'This is bad,'\" Weinberg said.\n\n\"Because they're a litigator and I'm basically attacking something that they just wrote, they would instantly read the screen,\" he added.\n\nWeinberg said the approach was risky because early versions of the tool could hallucinate, and a bad output could kill a conversation instantly.\n\n\"But the times that they got it right, it was over,\" Weinberg said, referring to moments when the analysis landed and won the lawyer's attention.\n\nHarvey is one of the most closely watched startups in legal AI, aiming to transform how Big Law firms work. In December, the company said it had reached a valuation of $8 billion after a funding round led by A16z.\n\nWeinberg said he relied on cold outreach in Harvey's early days, messaging thousands of lawyers on LinkedIn to secure early calls.\n\n\"I'd been practicing law for like eight months,\" Weinberg said of the period when he started the company. \"I didn't have any connections.\"\n\nThe legal AI sector is expanding fast, and Weinberg said the scale of the opportunity is forcing constant change inside Harvey.\n\nHe said the company's rapid growth has pushed him to \"reinvent\" himself as a founder every few months, often rethinking leadership hires and company structure to keep up with demand.\n\nDespite Harvey's rise to an $8 billion valuation, Weinberg has played down the idea of a single dominant winner in legal tech. In a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" session last month, he said the market is simply too large.\n\n\"There are around 10 million global legal professionals, and Harvey serves just single-digit percentage points of them,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think a single player is going to capture all of the pretty enormous amount of value that will be created in the next 10 years in this space,\" he added.\n\nWeinberg said the global legal market is worth roughly $1 trillion, yet only about $30 billion is spent on technology.\n\nInvestor interest has followed the shift. Legal-tech startups raised $3.2 billion last year, according to Business Insider's December analysis of Crunchbase data and deals.\n\nAI adoption is also accelerating inside law firms. Five of the 10 largest US law firms by revenue told Business Insider in July that they were using AI in their workflows, including for document review and spotting compliance risks.",

    "fullText": "Patti Smith, 79, says aging hasn't slowed her down. Instead, it's made her more determined to keep creating for as long as she can.\n\nDuring an appearance on Monday's episode of \"Talk Easy with Sam Fragoso,\" the punk icon spoke about her decadeslong career and how aging has sharpened her awareness of time.\n\n\"I'm going to be 79 years old. You know, my mother only lived to be 82 and suddenly, chronology has a different meaning,\" Smith told podcast host Sam Fragoso. Smith turned 79 on December 30.\n\nSmith said she \"never thought a whole lot\" about how much time she had left, but that's changed in recent years.\n\n\"Because I've always sort of been a youngish person and always, you know, survived whatever came up. But you start thinking about it, you know, not intentionally, but you know, when I think about it, in just a little over a year, I'll be 80 years old. That's a number,\" Smith said.\n\n\"And I have so much to do and so many things I want to do, so many things I want to write,\" she said.\n\nSmith added that she sometimes experiences feelings that are \"a little dark.\"\n\n\"Sometimes we feel disenfranchised, even from ourselves, but we come back like a boomerang,\" she said.\n\nBut even at her age, Smith says she still sees herself as a worker.\n\n\"I work every day. I work hard. It might not always be something that the people will see or anyone will benefit by, but I do my work. Whether it's a domestic task or writing a poem or doing a performance or speaking to you, I do my work,\" she said.\n\nDuring the conversation, Smith also reflected on the losses she has experienced over the years.\n\nHer husband, Fred Smith, died of heart failure in 1994, a few weeks before her brother died after a stroke. Smith had previously lost her longtime pianist, Richard Sohl, in 1990 and her close friend and collaborator, Robert Mapplethorpe, in 1989.\n\nSmith said that caring for her two young children gave her a reason to keep going.\n\n\"And I love life, you know. I've always loved life,\" she said, adding that she has \"always fought to live.\"\n\n\"I am happy every day that I have an opportunity to do new work or find new work or you know, experience something, even nature,\" Smith said.\n\nWhen asked how she manages to keep moving forward, she said desire has always been her driving force.\n\n\"At the worst of times, I didn't ever have a moment where I didn't want to live. I could say I didn't want to have to live without Fred, but in the end, I didn't want to end my life, you know?\" she said.\n\nShe also believes in the resilience of humans and says that she tries not to take the loss of her loved ones personally.\n\n\"In fact, people have often said, 'I can't believe of all that happened to you,' and I would say, 'It didn't happen to me, it happened to them,'\" she said.\n\nInstead, Smith says those trials she faced in life have made her want to live more fiercely.\n\n\"I'm just one of those people that just wants to live. I mean, I'd love to live till 102,\" she said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Smith has talked about growing older. In May 2024, she spoke about coming to terms with her changing appearance on the \"Wiser Than Me with Julia Louis-Dreyfus\" podcast.\n\n\"I had a very youthful appearance for a long time. And in the last couple of years, I can see my aging process. So I felt OK, as long as I do good work. As long as I can do good work and can be reasonably pleased with my appearance. That's fine with me. I'm not so deeply connected with that anymore,\" Smith said.",

    "title": "Americans Are Embracing Toyota’s Electrified Lineup at Record Levels",
    "description": "Toyota’s 2025 results prove that hybrids are the heart of the U.S. market. With nearly 50% of sales now electrified, models like the Camry and RAV4 are leading a pragmatic shift toward efficiency, even as full EVs and hydrogen models remain niche.",
    "fullText": "Despite widespread discussion about slowing momentum for fully electric vehicles in the United States, Toyota’s latest sales results tell a very different story about electrification as a whole. In 2025, the Japanese automaker achieved a milestone year in the U.S. market, proving that while battery-electric vehicles may face headwinds, consumer demand for electrified powertrains remains exceptionally strong.\n\nAccording to official figures, Toyota sold a total of 1,051,397 electrified vehicles in the United States during 2025. This figure includes hybrids, fully electric vehicles, and a small number of hydrogen fuel-cell models. Put into perspective, nearly 49 percent of all Toyota vehicles sold last year were powered at least in part by an electric motor.\n\nCompared with 2024, Toyota’s electrified vehicle sales grew by 19 percent, a substantial increase for a brand that already operates at a massive scale. The primary driver behind this growth is clear: hybrids.\n\nThe best example is the Toyota Camry, which is now offered exclusively as a hybrid in the U.S. market. In 2025, Camry recorded an impressive 316,185 sales, reinforcing Toyota’s decision to fully commit its most popular sedan to hybrid-only power.\n\nThe Toyota Corolla Hybrid also delivered its strongest sales year ever, reflecting growing acceptance of hybrid technology among mainstream buyers. Meanwhile, the large SUV Toyota Sequoia, now sold only as a hybrid, further strengthened Toyota’s electrification strategy by proving that even traditionally fuel-hungry segments can successfully transition to hybrid powertrains.\n\nWhile hybrids continue to surge, Toyota’s fully electric and hydrogen-powered models tell a more modest story. The brand’s sole battery-electric offering, marketed under the Toyota bZ nameplate, saw sales decline by 15.9 percent year over year. Deliveries fell from 18,570 units in 2024 to 15,609 in 2025.\n\nAn even sharper drop affected the hydrogen-powered Toyota Mirai, where demand fell by 57.9 percent. Sales decreased from 499 units in 2024 to just 210 vehicles last year. In absolute terms, however, hydrogen models remain a very small part of Toyota’s overall sales picture in the United States.\n\nThese results make one thing clear: at least for now, hybrids are the backbone of Toyota’s electrification success, while full EVs and fuel-cell vehicles play a supporting role.\n\nWhen results from Toyota’s luxury division are included, the impact of electrification becomes even more pronounced. Across Toyota Motor North America, electrified vehicles accounted for 47 percent of total U.S. sales in 2025.\n\nAt Lexus, electrified models made up 35.6 percent of total sales, marking a new record for the brand. Lexus delivered 131,851 vehicles equipped with partial or full electrification, underscoring how hybrid systems are increasingly accepted even in the premium segment.\n\nCombined, Toyota and Lexus delivered a total of 1,183,248 electrified vehicles in the U.S. market during 2025.\n\nFrom an industry standpoint, these numbers are highly significant. They demonstrate what happens when a high-volume manufacturer transitions its most popular models to hybrid-only configurations while simultaneously expanding hybrid availability across its lineup. The recent introduction of hybrid variants for traditionally rugged models like the Toyota 4Runner and Toyota Tacoma is likely to push these figures even higher.\n\nRather than betting everything on fully electric vehicles, Toyota’s multi-path strategy appears well aligned with current U.S. consumer preferences, where buyers seek improved fuel efficiency and lower emissions without the range anxiety or charging concerns associated with EVs.\n\nGiven the current trajectory, it would not be surprising if electrified vehicles surpass the 50 percent mark of Toyota’s U.S. sales as early as this year. At this point, the question is no longer whether Toyota will cross that threshold, but when.\n\nIn a market often portrayed as cooling on electrification, Toyota’s results highlight a more nuanced reality: Americans may be cautious about going fully electric, but they are embracing electrification in forms that fit seamlessly into their daily lives.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Autorepublika.com and has been republished with permission by Guessing Headlights.

    "description": "Iraq announces full withdrawal of US forces from its federal territory",
    "fullText": "Iraq’s government on Sunday said US forces had completed a “full withdrawal” from military facilities within the country’s federal territory, which excludes the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region where US troops remain.\n\nIraq’s defense ministry said the final contingent of US advisers had departed from Al-Asad Air Base in Anbar province in western Iraq, which hosted US troops for more than two decades.\n\nThe US military has been drawing down for several years after the Iraqi government called for it do so in 2023\n\nThe US-led coalition to fight against the Islamic State group, also withdrew from the Joint Operations Command headquarters, leaving the installations under full control of Iraqi security forces, the ministry statement added.\n\nUS forces still remain at Harir Air Base in Erbil province, located in the Kurdistan Region. Iraq’s central government does not fully control the Kurdish region in northern Iraq as it’s an autonomous federal entity with its own government, parliament and security forces, recognized by the Iraqi constitution.\n\nThe US military presence in Iraq has fluctuated greatly since the 2003 invasion. At its height, the US had 170,000 troops in Iraq. In 2011, former President Barack Obama withdrew US forces from the country. Around 5,000 troops were deployed to Iraq in 2014 at the request of the Iraqi government, seeking US assistance in the fight against ISIS.\n\nFrom December 2021, when the US military announced the end of its combat role in the country, the US has had roughly 2,500 troops in Iraq in an advise and assist capacity.\n\nThe Iraqi ministry released a video Saturday showing senior Iraqi military commanders walking through empty halls and corridors inside Al-Asad Air Base.\n\nThe US Department of Defense’s Central Command told CNN Sunday that “Iraqi Ministry of Defense’s earlier statement indicating the handover were factual,” without providing further details.\n\nThe withdrawal comes amid regional tensions between the US and Iran, as US President Donald Trump considers whether to strike Iran amid deadly street protests against the country’s authoritarian regime.\n\nUS forces stationed at the Al-Asad base have been attacked scores of times over the years by Iran and Iranian-backed groups.\n\nIn January 2020, Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on US forces at Al-Asad in retaliation for a drone strike at a Baghdad airport that killed Iran’s most powerful military commander, Qasem Soleimani. The heavy bombardment lasted for around two hours, targeting only the US areas of the shared base.\n\nFollowing the October 7, 2023, terror attacks in Israel, Iran-aligned militia groups launched a series of missile strikes on Al-Asad. In August 2024, five US service members and two US contractors were injured in an attack.\n\nIraqi officials on Sunday said its armed forces across all branches possess sufficient capability to secure the country and the future cooperation with the US will center on training, equipment acquisition, joint exercises, and operational coordination under bilateral agreements.\n\nWhile Iraq considers the coalition mission concluded on its territory, officials noted that coalition operations against ISIS and other terror groups continue in Syria. Baghdad expects logistical support to transit through the coalition’s air base in Erbil and did not rule out joint US-Iraqi counter-ISIS operations launched from Al-Asad if deemed necessary.\n\nThe US withdrawal may strengthen the government’s position in negotiations over the disarmament of non-state armed groups, as some of Iran-backed militias have cited the US presence to justify retaining their weapons.\n\nMilitias like Kataib Hezbollah and Harakat al-Nujaba, among Iraq’s most powerful armed groups and designated by the US as “terrorist entities,” rejected disarmament. They said they would surrender their weapons only once Iraq achieves full sovereignty, including the withdrawal of foreign forces from Iraq.\n\nThere were no immediate comments from the militias regarding the announcement. Although many have formally integrated into the Popular Mobilization Forces, they remain influential actors in Iraq’s security, political, and economic spheres.\n\nCNN’s Piper Hudspeth Blackburn contributed reporting.",

    "title": "Mortgage and refinance interest rates today, January 18, 2026: Weekly rates drop by 19 basis points",
    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance rates, which are down across the board since this time last week. The 30-year rate is under 6%. Lock in your rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nCurrent mortgage rates are under 6%. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has decreased by 19 basis points over the last month and is now 5.90%. The 15-year fixed rate has dropped by 16 basis points in this time, now sitting at 5.36%. To take advantage of today's low mortgage rates, shop with several mortgage lenders to find the best deal.\n\nMORE: Sub-6% rates: See which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nLearn whether now is a good time to refinance your mortgage.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage terms and interest rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use. It also considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when determining your estimated monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a more realistic idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate today is 5.90%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is lower than with a shorter-term loan.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.36% today. When deciding between a 15-year and a 30-year mortgage, consider your short-term versus long-term goals.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to accumulate. But the trade-off is that your monthly payment will be higher as you pay off the same amount in half the time.\n\nLet’s say you get a $300,000 mortgage. With a 30-year term and a 5.90% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,779, and you’d pay $340,587 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.36% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,429. But you’d only pay $137,224 in interest over the years.\n\nWith a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for the entire life of your loan. You will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage, though.\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a predetermined period of time. Then, the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remaining 23 years of your term.\n\nAdjustable rates typically start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, it’s possible your rate will go up. Lately, though, some fixed rates have been starting lower than adjustable rates. Talk to your lender about its rates before choosing one or the other.\n\nRead more about fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, great or excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So, if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nWaiting for rates to drop probably isn’t the best method to get the lowest mortgage rate right now. If you’re ready to buy, focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate.\n\nTo find the best mortgage lender for your situation, apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four companies. Just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame — doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score.\n\nWhen choosing a lender, don’t just compare interest rates. Look at the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR) — this factors in the interest rate, any discount points, and fees. The APR, which is also expressed as a percentage, reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money. This is probably the most important number to look at when comparing mortgage lenders.\n\nLearn 6 tips for choosing a mortgage lender.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate for purchasing a home is 5.90%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.36%. But these are national averages, so the average in your area could be different. Averages are typically higher in expensive parts of the U.S. and lower in less expensive areas.\n\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.91% right now, according to Zillow. However, you might get an even better rate with an excellent credit score, sizable down payment, and low debt-to-income ratio (DTI).\n\nNot much. According to its December forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.4% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate above 6% through next year, yet dipping down to 5.9% in Q4 2026.\n\nThe best mortgage lenders offer low interest rates, a range of loan programs, and high customer satisfaction. Choose the best mortgage lender for your needs.\n\nA mortgage refinance involves replacing your original home loan with a new one. Learn how to refinance a mortgage loan and decide if it's the right choice for you.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nYou can usually refinance your mortgage with the same bank or lender, but you don’t have to. Learn the pros and cons of using the same lender.\n\nYou can get a low-cost refinance by shopping for mortgage lenders or boosting your credit score.

    "fullText": "It was bound to happen eventually, and it appears the calendar flipping to 2026 was the right time for one person to publicly consider that the question surrounding aliens may not be a \"what if,\" but instead, a \"when?\" There has been an increasing number of theories and beliefs surrounding the existence of aliens, and the topic has seemingly intensified over the past year. Now, a longtime former employee who spent 10 years at The Bank of England, has reportedly flipped the switch from theories to a full-blown warning about extraterrestrial life. Interestingly, one of the biggest reported driving factors behind this warning stems from the United States, and the belief that a significant disclosure is on the horizon.\n\nIn a story that features no shortage of eye-opening tidbits, Helen McCaw, who served as a senior analyst in financial security at The Bank of England, sent a message to the bank with a significant alien warning. The short of it? McCaw wrote to Andrew Bailey, the bank's governor, urging him to prepare for the possibility that the United States, specifically the White House, may confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life, as The Sunday Times reported.\n\nMcCaw's overarching concern includes her belief that if the White House were to declare this, it would significantly impact the markets and could ignite bank collapses. She cited the United States appearing to be \"partway through a multi-year process to declassify and disclose information\" regarding alien life forms, per The Times.\n\n\"The United States government appears to be partway through a multi-year process to declassify and disclose information on the existence of a technologically advanced non-human intelligence responsible for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs),\" she claimed.\n\nWhile there are no shortage of outspoken believers in extraterrestrial life issuing warnings and discussing the topic across social media platforms, the comments coming from a longtime member of the UK's central bank will undoubtedly turn heads.\n\nThe longtime Bank of England employee expanded on the topic, discussing the possibility of a \"power or intelligence greater than any government,\" referencing the \"unknown intentions\" that would come with it. McCaw added to her belief that the government's leadership and central banks may not be \"properly briefed\" on the topic of aliens or other life forms.\n\n\"If the UAP proves to be of non-human origin, we may have to acknowledge the existence of a power or intelligence greater than any government and with potentially unknown intentions,\" McCaw said.",

    "description": "Hundreds of delegates from Vietnam's ruling Communist Party gathered on Monday under tight security for a congress that will select the single-party",
    "fullText": "HANOI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Hundreds of delegates from Vietnam's ruling Communist Party gathered on Monday under tight security for a congress that will select the single-party country's top leader and set economic goals for the remainder of the decade.\n\nThe week-long event, which ​operates under opaque rules and convenes every five years, could cement and possibly expand power for the party's current general secretary, To Lam, who ‌has launched sweeping bureaucratic reforms at home and become Vietnam's public face overseas.\n\nLater in the week, on an unspecified day, about 1,600 delegates will elect a 200-person Central Committee, which will then pick ‌from a pre-arranged shortlist up to 17 to 19 members of the Politburo from which the general secretary is chosen.\n\nLam is seeking to retain his role and possibly take on the state presidency, which has recently been held by a military leader, officials briefed on the matter said. Lam, photographed smiling in state media as he entered the congress venue on Monday, is expected to address delegates on Tuesday.\n\nThe congress is likely to confirm him as general secretary, according to multiple officials, although surprises ⁠cannot be ruled out, while the decision about the presidency ‌is expected to be made at a later meeting where the outcome is even less clear.\n\nAfter the congress, the Politburo will nominate the heads of state, government and Parliament. Parliamentary elections will take place only after leaders are chosen by the ‍party.\n\nLam, 68, has launched several major reforms during his brief tenure as party chief, the country's most powerful job. He ascended to the position following the death of his predecessor, Nguyen Phu Trong, in July 2024.\n\nWidely viewed as a risk-taker, Lam introduced the most significant administrative reform in decades when he cut tens of thousands of jobs in an ​effort to speed up decisions. The impact has yet to be fully assessed as officials adapt, but approval timelines for some investment projects have shortened.\n\nThat ‌acceleration is tied in part to the scaling back of a sweeping anti‑corruption drive launched under Trong, an effort that Lam helped lead as public security minister. The campaign, which was meant to combat systemic bribery, at times paralysed government decision‑making and led to the downfall of senior figures - including two presidents - clearing Lam's path to the top.\n\nLam has also launched economic reforms and a burst of infrastructure projects, winning favour with foreign investors while stoking concerns about favouritism and waste.\n\nIn a country that allows no opposition, Lam has presided over a strengthening of the security forces and a tightening of controls over media and other critical ⁠voices.\n\nECONOMIC GROWTH, SECURITY TOP NEXT FIVE-YEAR AGENDA\n\nThe congress' delegates represent 5.6 million party members in ​a country of 100 million.\n\nUnder tight security - mobile phones will be jammed in the Hanoi building ​where the congress will take place and delegates, including those from Hanoi, are required to stay in designated accommodation - they will also refine the text of a resolution to be approved by the end of the congress, which is scheduled to wrap up ‍on January 25.\n\nA party draft released in ⁠October on the party's website suggests the final text will prioritise security and ambitious growth, targeting at least 10% annually over the next five years, from the 6.5% to 7.0% target that was missed in the first half of the decade.\n\nThe draft mentions security dozens of times and highlights ⁠the importance of diplomacy and defence in a \"more dangerous\" world. The party intends to increase its defence forces, especially in border areas, the draft text says.\n\nEnvironmental protection, which has been increasingly ‌debated recently in the heavily polluted country, has also gained prominence, according to Politburo member Nguyen Xuan Thang.",

    "fullText": "Wayne Rooney says Manchester United's younger fans got a \"taste of what it was like under Sir Alex Ferguson\" during their 2-0 win over Manchester City - and hopes it is a glimpse of what is to come under Michael Carrick.\n\nCarrick, 44, was appointed as United's interim head coach on Tuesday until the end of the season, replacing the sacked Ruben Amorim.\n\nGoals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu secured a deserved victory over Pep Guardiola's City on Saturday at a raucous Old Trafford.\n\nRooney, who won five Premier League titles alongside Carrick at United, thinks there was a big difference in the home crowd under the leadership of his former team-mate.\n\n\"I wasn't at the stadium, I was in the BBC studios, but did you see the difference in the stadium? Even when he [Michael Carrick] walked out before the game and he's trying to pump the crowd up,\" Rooney said on the latest edition of BBC podcast The Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n\"I think the fans felt something yesterday. They got a taste of what it was like under Sir Alex Ferguson. Some of the young fans who have been through a terrible time over the last 10, 13 years, really, since Fergie left.\n\n\"They haven't witnessed a team perform that well. I've been part of some of those teams as well. I've played in some of them.\n\n\"They haven't witnessed a team perform that well, with that energy and that belief in their fighting and being brave with the ball, but also being resilient and tough to play against.\n\n\"Them fans felt that yesterday and hopefully that's a glimpse of what we've got coming in the next 16 games.\"",

    "description": "Near-weightless conditions can mutate genes and alter the physical structures of bacteria and phages, disrupting their normal interactions in ways that could help us treat drug-resistant infections.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nBacteria and the viruses that infect them, called phages, are locked in an evolutionary arms race. But that evolution follows a different trajectory when the battle takes place in microgravity, a study conducted aboard the International Space Station (ISS) reveals.\n\nAs bacteria and phages duke it out, bacteria evolve better defenses to survive while phages evolve new ways to penetrate those defenses. The new study, published Jan. 13 in the journal PLOS Biology, details how that skirmish unfolds in space and reveals insights that could help us design better drugs for antibiotic-resistant bacteria on Earth.\n\nIn the study, researchers compared populations of E. coli infected with a phage known as T7. One set of microbes was incubated aboard the ISS, while identical control groups were grown on Earth.\n\nThe analysis of the space-station samples revealed that microgravity fundamentally altered the speed and nature of phage infection.\n\nWhile the phages could still successfully infect and kill the bacteria in space, the process took longer than it did in the Earth samples. In an earlier study, the same researchers had hypothesized that infection cycles in microgravity would be slower because fluids don't mix as well in microgravity as they do in Earth's gravity.\n\n\"This new study validates our hypothesis and expectation,\" said lead study author Srivatsan Raman, an associate professor in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nOn Earth, the fluids bacteria and viruses exist within are constantly being stirred by gravity — warm water rises, cold water sinks, and heavier particles settle at the bottom. This keeps everything moving and bumping into each other.\n\nIn space, there is no stirring; everything just floats. So because the bacteria and phages weren't bumping into each other as often, phages had to adapt to a much slower pace of life and become more efficient at grabbing onto passing bacteria.\n\nExperts think understanding this alternative form of phage evolution could help them develop new phage therapies. These emerging treatments for infections use phages to kill bacteria or make the germs more vulnerable to traditional antibiotics.\n\n\"If we can work out what phages are doing on the genetic level in order to adapt to the microgravity environment, we can apply that knowledge to experiments with resistant bacteria,\" Nicol Caplin, a former astrobiologist at the European Space Agency who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. \"And this can be a positive step in the race to optimise antibiotics on Earth.\"\n\nWhole-genome sequencing revealed that both the bacteria and the phages on the ISS accumulated distinctive genetic mutations not observed in the samples on Earth. The space-based viruses accumulated specific mutations that boosted their ability to infect bacteria, as well as their ability to bind to bacterial receptors. Simultaneously, the E. coli developed mutations that protected against the phages' attacks — by tweaking their receptors, for instance — and enhanced their survival in microgravity.\n\nThen, the researchers used a technique called deep mutational scanning to examine the changes in the viruses' receptor-binding proteins. They found that the adaptations driven by the unique cosmic environment may have practical applications back home.\n\nWhen the phages were transported back to Earth and tested, the space-adapted changes in their receptor-binding protein resulted in increased activity against E. coli strains that commonly cause urinary tract infections. These strains are typically resistant to the T7 phages.\n\n\"It was a serendipitous finding,\" Raman said. \"We were not expecting that the [mutant] phages that we identified on the ISS would kill pathogens on Earth.\"\n\n—Antibiotic found hiding in plain sight could treat dangerous infections, early study finds\n\n—How fast can antibiotic resistance evolve?\n\n—Antibiotic resistance makes once-lifesaving drugs useless. Could we reverse it?\n\n\"These results show how space can help us improve the activity of phage therapies,\" said Charlie Mo, an assistant professor in the Department of Bacteriology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study.\n\n\"However,\" Mo added, \"we do have to factor in the cost of sending phages into space or simulating microgravity on Earth to achieve these results.\"\n\nIn addition to helping fight infections in Earthbound patients, the research could help yield more effective phage therapies for use in microgravity, Mo suggested. \"This could be important for astronauts' health on long-term space missions — for example, missions to the moon or Mars, or prolonged ISS stays.\"",

Gen. Bangun Nawoko, the South Sulawesi’s military commander. He said that visibility at the summit was about 5 meters (16 miles).\n\nRescuers spotted additional bodies lying along a steep cliff, but haven't been able to reach them yet, said Brig. Gen. Andre Clift Rumbayan, who leads the specialized search units.\n\nThe search was halted as darkness fell Sunday and was to resume on Monday morning.\n\nIndonesia relies heavily on air transport and ferries to connect its more than 17,000 islands. The Southeast Asian country has been plagued by transportation accidents in recent years, from plane and bus crashes to ferry sinkings.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMike Tomlin stepped down from the Pittsburgh Steelers' head coaching gig after 19 seasons.\n\nThat stretch included a Super Bowl victory and didn't include a single losing season.\n\nNow, it appears Tomlin is at least taking a break before he continues coaching.\n\nThat has allowed some discussion of his legacy. And on a recent podcast appearance by Steelers legend James Harrison, he spoke with former Browns star Joe Haden about Tomlin.\n\nMORE: Bills are wasting Josh Allen's prime, and it's time to fire Sean McDermott\n\nHaden asked Harrison if Tomlin is a Hall of Famer.\n\n“To me, I can’t give him a Hall of Fame coach (nod) because he hasn’t made disciples,” Harrison went on. “You’re telling me You’re telling me you’re a Hall of Fame coach, but no one has followed you?… That can’t be the thing. He’s the only coach that has coached this long and does not have a tree. Guys are emotionally attached to him, not performance. A great coach, the measurement of greatness, it’s not based on personal experiences and relationships you have with them. It is purely on what you did as a coach. Did you get championships? Did you build disciples?”\n\nMORE: Exploring 5 wild Broncos QB options to replace Bo Nix\n\nHarrison wasn't done talking bad about his former coach.\n\n“So, a Hall of Fame should be making history for having the longest losing streak in playoff history?” Harrison wondered aloud.\n\nHarrison was crucial to Tomlin's Super Bowl. He had a 100-yard interception return for a touchdown against the Arizona Cardinals in that game.\n\nApparently, he thinks Tomlin should've won more without him, too.\n\nBrowns can draft the brother of a Cavs' NBA star\n\nA.J.

    "fullText": "As Lexi Thompson steps away from the LPGA spotlight, the golf star is embracing a new chapter in her personal life. Turning heads off the course, Thompson recently celebrated her bachelorette party in style, offering fans a glimpse into her wedding preparations. The joyful milestone arrives amid her competitive hiatus, marking a moment of balance between career reflection and personal celebration as she prepares for the next phase of her life.\n\nLexi Thompson took to Instagram to share some moments from her bachelorette party.\n\n“So much fun at @moxiesusa for bachelorette celebrations,” captioned Thompson below a series of pictures from her bachelorette.\n\nThe LPGA Tour pro celebrated with her friends at the Moxies restaurant. Thompson is set to marry Max Provost in March 2026.\n\nBack in early 2025, the 30-year-old announced her engagement to Provost. According to the reports, Provost asked the all-important question to Thompson on New Year’s Day 2025, in Whistler, Canada. And much to his elation, the 1x major champion gave the nod, agreeing to be tied with Provost for life. While Max Provost is keeping his life very private, from his LinkedIn profile, we can see that he is a Clinical Sales Representative for Intuitive Surgical.\n\n“I work with physicians and surgeons to help with the adoption of daVinci robotics in surgery. I help enhance the lives of patients by offering and educating on a state-of-the-art minimally invasive surgical modality that leads to faster recovery, less complications, and a better overall quality of life,” his bio reads.\n\nAs of now, Thompson is semi-retired. Following her participation in the 2024 U.S. Women’s Open, Thompson declared that she will no longer participate in a full LPGA season from now on.\n\nThompson turned pro at just 15 years of age. She has, till now, clinched 15 professional titles, out of which 11 of her victories came in the LPGA Tour. Thus, when she announced a semi-retirement from her career, although fans were shocked, according to Thompson, the decision was exactly what she needed.\n\n“I want to have a family one day and just enjoy every experience of that and be there for every single moment. That’s the most important for me. I’ve only known golf as my life. So it’s nice to branch out and be able to enjoy other things,” she said in a statement after she announced her retirement in 2024.\n\nWith Thompson trying to soak in the essence of life, fans soon had their voices heard online.\n\nIn the Instagram post, Thompson shared how she has spent quality time with her friends. Witnessing the lavish celebration, one fan noted, “Well, that looks like fun, and you look gorgeous and so happy\n\n.” Another fan, too, echoed the same thoughts and wrote, “Looks like fun! Congratulations & enjoy the moment\n\nWith just weeks left for the D-Day to arrive, good wishes have already started pouring in for the LPGA golfer. One such comment read, “SOO Many congratulations\n\nLexi. Wonderful to see you happy\n\n”. Another fan chimed in, “Congratulations, Lexi.”\n\nAs Thompson had taken a break from the competitive realm by taking a semi-retirement, and fans would not be getting to see the star play in all the calendar events, one golf enthusiast mentioned, “Going to miss seeing you on the course this season.”\n\nThus, with things looking rosy for the 30-year-old, fans cannot wait to see her enjoy life to the fullest post her marriage.\n\nThe post Lexi Thompson Turns Heads at Her Bachelorette Party as Wedding Preps Begin Amid LPGA Hiatus appeared first on EssentiallySports.",

They visit the Hurricanes on Thursday before hosting Tampa Bay on Friday night.\n\n“As far as I know, he won't play tomorrow. Unless something drastically changed, I don't think he will,” coach Jeff Blashill said of Nazar. “So that would allow him another full practice at least and then see where we go from there.”\n\nBlashill also said Teuvo Teravainen won't play against the Jets because of an upper-body injury. The 31-year-old forward got hurt in the first period of last week's 4-1 loss to Edmonton.\n\nNazar, a first-round pick in the 2022 draft, has six goals and 15 assists in 33 games this season.

    "description": "Senegal beat Morocco to claim their second Afcon title despite walking off the pitch after a late penalty award which also sparked chaos in the stands.",
    "fullText": "Pape Gueye's extra-time goal was enough to seal a second Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) title for Senegal, after chaotic scenes at the end of normal time saw the West Africans walk off the pitch and Brahim Diaz miss a penalty for Morocco in the 24th minute of injury time.\n\nThe lengthy delay came after the spot kick was awarded via the intervention of the video assistant referee (VAR), sparking angry scenes on the touchline and in the crowd, with Senegal fans clashing with security after attempting to break on to the pitch.\n\nAfter waiting so long to take his penalty, Diaz was under immense pressure, having been handed the chance to end his country's 50-year wait to lift the Afcon trophy with essentially the final kick of the game, but his decision to chip the ball down the middle backfired horrendously as Edouard Mendy was able to stand his ground and collect in embarrassingly simple fashion.\n\nAfter 90 minutes which were largely devoid of obvious goalscoring opportunities, the unsavoury scenes at the end were a poor advert for African football, especially with Morocco talking up this tournament as a test event for co-hosting the 2030 Fifa World Cup.\n\nChances did come at both ends after Gueye's strike four minutes into extra time, but the closest Morocco came to an equaliser was when Nayef Aguerd powered a header against the bar from a corner.\n\nAnd as the rain poured down in Rabat, Morocco's dream of a first continental crown since 1976 was washed away in dramatic fashion.\n\n'An ambassador for African football' - Mane is Senegal's Afcon hero\n\nSenegal walk off in Afcon final over penalty award\n\nSenegal were understandably jubilant at the end, having somehow found a way to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, but the sight of celebrating players being separated from their supporters by massed ranks of police in riot gear said everything about the way this game finished.\n\nHaving won a first title by beating Egypt on penalties at the 2021 edition, many of the same players returned here for a second bite of the cherry, including talisman Sadio Mane, who has hinted heavily that this will be his last appearance at an Afcon.\n\nBut unlike in Cameroon, this time the Teranga Lions were up against the hosts and the fiery atmosphere inside the impressive Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium.\n\nA first-ever meeting between the two teams at a finals saw Morocco edge proceedings in the first half, but Senegal have the best openings.\n\nYassine Bounou made a good scrambling save at his far post to keep out Gueye's goalbound header from a corner, while the African goalkeeper of the year also denied Iliman Ndiaye with a trailing leg.\n\nThe start of the second half saw a fired up Morocco exert greater dominance, pinning back their opponents, but still struggling to create clear-cut chances.\n\nIn fact, the Atlas Lions got lucky at the start of injury time when Ismaila Sarr nodded the ball into the net after Abdoulaye Seck's initial header came back off the woodwork after a corner.\n\nHowever, referee Jean Jacques Ndala had already blown his whistle, awarding a very soft foul for contact between Seck and Morocco captain Achraf Hakimi.\n\nBut that was just the start of the drama, as what followed will inevitably be what this game is remembered for.\n\nWith eight minutes having originally been added on, Ndala was advised by VAR to check a tug by West Ham defender El Hadji Malick Diouf on Diaz from a corner, with the Congolese deciding to award the spot kick.\n\nWhat started out as fierce complaints by the Senegalese players quickly descended into chaos on the touchline as both benches emptied onto the pitch.\n\nHaving gone head-to-head with opposite number Walid Regragui, Senegal coach Pape Thiaw called his players down the tunnel, while West African fans, some wielding metal chairs, also attempted to fight their way on to the playing surface.\n\nFollowing a lengthy delay, with Mane the only Teranga Lions player who looked truly uncomfortable with the walk-off, everyone returned to the pitch and Diaz was finally able to take his penalty for what should have been a celebratory moment for his country.\n\nBut with history beckoning, the Real Madrid man tried to showboat with a Panenka and paid the price in a way which he is unlikely to ever forget.\n\nMorocco, Africa's top team in the world rankings, came into this tournament feeling like they had a date with destiny.\n\nFor more than a decade, King Mohammed VI has poured huge sums of money into the game, using it as a tool for societal and cultural change, a move which resulted in the Atlas Lions becoming the first African nation to reach a World Cup semi-final at Qatar 2022.\n\nBut this Afcon was supposed to be their crowing achievement, the moment to end a long trophy drought stretching back to 1976.\n\nInstead, they become just the fourth hosts to lose in a final - having seen the past 12 who have reach the showpiece end up as champions.\n\nThe moment which broke their hearts came from Villarreal man Gueye, a towering midfield presence who has been one of the tournament's standout players.\n\nHaving burst forward from just inside the Moroccan half, he shrugged off a tired-looking challenge from Hakimi just outside the box and smashed a left-foot rocket into the top right-hand corner, clipping the underside of the bar as it went in.\n\nMorocco did their best to fight back, with substitute Youssef En-Nesyri stooping to head just wide at the near post 10 minutes after Gueye's goal and Aguerd's header off the bar following in the second half of extra time.\n\nBut Senegal also had chances to extend their lead, with Paris St-Germain teenager Ibrahim Mbaye's slaloming run and shot blocked by a lunging Hakimi and Cherif Ndiaye denied by a brilliant double save from Bounou.\n\nAt the other end, Mendy was being bombarded with missiles thrown by fans behind his goal, with one invader making it onto the pitch next to the former Chelsea stopper before security managed to force him away.\n\nThe recriminations over the way in which this game ended will go on for some time - but Senegal are unlikely to care.\n\nIf this is to be Mane's final Afcon he has bowed out in style, and the sight of him being hoisted on to the shoulders of his team-mates, trophy in hand and having had the captain's armband thrust upon him, will hopefully last longer.",

    "description": "After the NFL regular season was spiced by debate over calls made or missed by the officials, it’s only natural for the playoffs to have such drama.",
    "fullText": "Even worse for the heartbroken Buffalo Bills as Ja’Quan McMillian ripped the football away from Brandin Cooks for the interception that gave the Denver Broncos new life in overtime of the Jan. 17 AFC divisional playoff game was the sight of back judge Scott Helverson instantly signaling a turnover.\n\nRather than a 39-yard completion that could have set up a potential game-winning field goal, the Bills saw victory snatched from their grasp in a hail of controversy.\n\nThe ruling from New York – where the NFL reviews all turnovers from its officiating command center at league headquarters – didn’t make it better for the Bills Mafia.\n\nAnd it will linger as another symbol of frustration for a franchise that has come up short again in its quest to get back to the Super Bowl.\n\n“It’s hard for me to understand why it was ruled the way it was ruled,” Bills coach Sean McDermott said during an emotional postgame news conference after the Broncos advanced to the AFC championship game with a 33-30 victory.\n\nSorry, Buffalo. It wouldn’t be the NFL without some sort of officiating controversy. After the dramatic regular season was spiced by several cases that inflamed debate over calls made or missed by the officials, it’s only natural for the playoffs to come wrapped with such drama.\n\nThe Bills – plus armchair quarterbacks, ex-players, informed analysts, internet influencers and probably others – maintained that Cooks should have been ruled down by contact after hauling in the rainbow throw from Josh Allen that traveled 55 yards in the air. Cooks and McMillian tumbled to the turf and rolled over with the nickel back emerging with the football.\n\nReferee Carl Cheffers explained that Cooks never had possession of the football as he crashed to the turf.\n\n“The defender is the one that completed the process of the catch, so the defender was awarded the ball,” Cheffers said in the Pro Football Writers Association (PFWA) pool report.\n\nMaybe so. Yet that hardly addresses the inconsistency that is often at the heart of debate concerning the calls or non-calls by NFL officials.\n\nHow many times have we seen a receiver barely touch the ground with a knee hitting the turf – as Cooks did – and getting credit for the catch?\n\nSure, there’s always a different perspective with freeze-frame video versus real-time eyesight. That’s part of what the officiating experts – in New York and on the field – undoubtedly have to process.\n\nIn any event, for Bills fans, the would-be catch by Cooks is their version of the “Dez Bryant caught it” controversy that dogged the Dallas Cowboys after the receiver’s apparent catch was ruled incomplete in an NFC divisional playoff loss at Green Bay in January 2015.\n\nOf course, McMillian wonders what the fuss is about.\n\n“I don’t really think he had complete control going down,” he said. “We were both fighting for the ball. I just made a play and basically took it out of his hands and came up with it.”\n\nAdding to Buffalo’s consternation were the two pass interference calls against Taron Johnson and Tre’Davious White, for 17 and 30 yards, respectively, that set up Wil Lutz’s chip-shot winning field goal.\n\nBlame the refs? Cheffers’ crew couldn’t be blamed for the DPI calls – Johnson pulled on Courtland Sutton’s arm as Bo Nix’s pass arrived. White hit intended target Marvin Mims, Jr. early – even in a game where it appeared the officials were not necessarily calling it tight.\n\nStill, you may never convince the Bills – stung in last year’s playoff by a questionable spot on an Allen run in crunch time of the AFC title game loss a Kansas City – that McMillian’s interception should have stood.\n\nMcDermott was unable to challenge the ruling for two reasons. All turnovers and scoring plays are automatically reviewed in New York at any point in the game. Besides, it was overtime, when coaches are unable to challenge a play as all replay reviews are initiated in New York.\n\nStill, credit McDermott for his next-best, last-gasp option: He called a timeout and requested a quick chat with Cheffers, who told him the turnover was confirmed in New York.\n\n“It was a rather rapid unfolding of the review, if there was a review, and so I called a timeout to try to slow it down,” McDermott said. “It would seem logical to me and make a lot of sense that the head official would walk over and want to go and take a look at it. Just to make sure that everybody from here who is in the stadium, to there (in New York) are on the same page. That’s too big of a play, in my estimation, too big of a play in a play that decided the game, potentially … to not even slow it down. That’s why I had to call the timeout.”\n\nThe controversy, nonetheless, will live on. Scrutiny on officials will likely intensify during the offseason as the NFL engages in negotiations with the union for officials as the expiration of their labor pact looms.\n\nSean Payton gets it. The Broncos coach had his own moment of officiating controversy in a high-stakes game during his tenure with the New Orleans Saints. A non-call of pass interference near the goal line stung New Orleans during an overtime loss to the Los Angeles Rams during the 2018 NFC Championship Game at the Superdome.\n\nHad the Broncos not survived on Sunday, Payton might have some sort of flashback – and surely been livid about an apparent missed call in overtime. Early on Buffalo’s final possession, it appeared that a holding call was missed as Allen threw from his end zone. A flag would have resulted in a safety.\n\n“A phenomenal play by ‘J-Mac,’” Payton said of McMillian’s interception. “But it should’ve ended really with a safety, which would’ve been the first in the history of football.”\n\nA playoff game ending on a penalty would have surely ignited some controversy.\n\nHey, there’s always next weekend.\n\nContact Jarrett Bell at jbell@usatoday.com or follow on X: @JarrettBell\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Bills vs Broncos interception controversy explained",

    "fullText": "Senegal's Africa Cup of Nations final match-winner Pape Gueye said his team had been fuelled by a sense of injustice after a controversial penalty award for Morocco which led to ugly scenes had almost cost them the title.\n\nThe match at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat was still goalless deep in injury time at the end of normal time when Morocco were awarded a spot-kick following a VAR check for a challenge on Brahim Diaz.\n\nAlready furious at having a goal disallowed at the other end for a soft-looking foul minutes earlier, Senegal reacted angrily to the decision and some of their players walked off the pitch in disgust.\n\nMeanwhile trouble broke out in the stands as some Senegalese fans tried to enter the field of play and became involved in fighting with security personnel.\n\nThe game was held up for almost 20 minutes before Diaz could take the penalty, and his weak kick was saved by Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.\n\nGueye then went on to score a brilliant goal in the fourth minute of extra time to give his team a 1-0 win and hand them the trophy.\n\n\"We had a feeling of injustice. Just before the penalty we thought we should have had a goal and the referee didn't go to VAR,\" said Villarreal midfielder Gueye, who added that Sadio Mane had urged the team to come back onto the pitch for the penalty.\n\n\"Sadio told us to come back on and we remobilised. Edouard then made the save, we stayed focused, got the goal and won the game.\"\n\nSenegal coach Pape Thiaw said he had told his team to walk off in the first place because they disagreed with the penalty decision, but he admitted that he should not have done so.\n\n\"After thinking about it, I realised that I shouldn't have asked them to go off. I apologise for that,\" Thiaw told French broadcaster beIN Sports.\n\n\"Sometimes you can react in the heat of the moment. Before that we scored a goal that was not given. But now we accept that referees do make mistakes and we apologise.\"\n\nIt was Senegal's second Cup of Nations title, four years after they claimed their first in Cameroon with a penalty shoot-out win in the final against Egypt.\n\nThe Lions of Teranga have also twice been runners-up, and remarkably Gueye's goal was the first Senegal have ever scored in four AFCON final appearances in total.\n\n\"We are very happy with the victory tonight,\" said Gueye, who pointed out that three Senegal players -- including regular starting right-back Krepin Diatta and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Pape Matar Sarr -- had been last-minute withdrawals from the final.\n\n\"We feel pride. We wanted to win tonight. We all saw what happened at the end of the match but we took the decision to come back onto the pitch and give everything, which we did.\"",

    "fullText": "Two English women’s teams became the first to pass £20million in annual revenues last season, according to the latest iteration of Deloitte’s Football Money League report.\n\nThe annual undertaking ranks football clubs worldwide by revenue, based on figures from the most recently completed season. The 2026 version, incorporating financials from 2024-25, is the fourth time Deloitte has included a women’s team ranking in a report that is now into its 29th year of publication.\n\nArsenal, who won the Champions League in May, topped the women’s listing for the first time, with revenues of £21.5m (€25.6m). Domestic rivals Chelsea trailed just behind (£21.3m), with the London clubs leaping above Barcelona Femeni (£18.5m), who led the way in 2023-24.\n\nThe report reflects continued revenue growth in women’s football, but there are caveats. For one, the United States, home to a slew of valuable women’s teams, is excluded. A note from Deloitte detailed the consultancy firm’s inability to obtain relevant information from clubs in the U.S., as well as other key women’s football markets, such as Australia and Sweden.\n\nAlso worth mentioning — and it applies to the men’s version of the report, too, which will be published later this week — is that an appearance on Deloitte’s list does not equate to financial stability. High revenues don’t necessarily equal profits. The report’s limited focus on turnover, alongside the fact that most clubs are yet to disclose last season’s accounts, means we don’t know what the world’s most prominent women’s teams spent on wages and the likes.\n\nChelsea had the third-highest revenues in 2023-24 at £11.5m, yet turned those into a deficit of £8.4m, a loss margin of 73 per cent. It is not yet known which women’s teams ran tight ships last season.\n\nEven allowing for those limitations, the report shows a clear driving force behind growing revenues in the women’s game: commercial income.\n\nOf the £132.2m collectively generated by the 15 highest-earning clubs in 2024-25, £95.8m came from commercial revenue streams. At 72 per cent of overall income, commercial earnings were more than double matchday and broadcast revenues combined. Eleven of the 12 clubs to disclose their splits of revenue and appear in this and last year’s lists enjoyed improved commercial income.\n\nThe largest growth, and the largest commercial income in women’s football, arrived at Chelsea, who more than doubled the revenue stream to £16m. That followed the internal sale of Chelsea Women to another business within the BlueCo sphere.\n\nThe transaction helped Chelsea’s men’s team comply with Premier League profitability and sustainability rules, a factor which was widely seen as the primary motive. Yet at the time of the reorganisation in May 2024, Chelsea said they hoped to “harness the full potential of the opportunity for women’s football” and, based on these latest figures, there are signs of them doing that.\n\nPer Deloitte’s report, that £16m commercial revenue was “driven by both attributions from club-wide sponsorship deals, as well as exclusive partnerships with major brands”. The latter was in evidence in July 2024 when Three, the telecommunications company, became the club’s first women’s-only principal partner, and other exclusive sponsorships have followed. D.Louise became the club’s first official jewellery partner in May 2025, followed four months later by Here We Flo, a period care brand.\n\nArsenal, too, boasted big commercial revenue last year, albeit there are questions around the origin of some of that amount. Per previous accounts for Arsenal Women, revenue includes ‘group income’, a figure which includes a support fee paid from the men’s team to the women’s to cover costs incurred. The Athletic does not have the 2024-25 accounts yet, but since the arrangement was introduced in June 2019, Arsenal Women have basically broken even every year, in part because the ‘revenue’ provided by the wider group is used.\n\nThat support fee is included in Deloitte’s commercial income figure, but it is unclear how much it comprised last season or previously. Per the basis of preparation note in the report, Deloitte advises the group income amount within Arsenal’s £13.6m commercial revenue “includes, among other components, revenue attributable to the women’s club from full club-wide commercial agreements, and revenue contributions from the men’s club”.\n\nAs with the men’s team, Emirates are Arsenal Women’s front-of-shirt sponsor and Adidas manufacture the kit. Those and other lead partners such as Sobha Realty and Visit Rwanda presumably make up the bulk of the commercial figure, but with no way of splitting the sum into revenue from external sources and that support fee, it is unclear how big Arsenal’s true commercial earnings are — or whether removing the support fee would see them fall from the top of the overall revenue list.\n\nTaken at face value, the commercial incomes of Chelsea and Arsenal’s women’s teams were higher than Sheffield United and Luton Town managed in the Premier League in 2023-24. Moreover, Arsenal’s £13.6m is higher than the most recent commercial income than 19 men’s EFL Championship clubs; for Chelsea, their £16m was higher than 21 clubs from the men’s second tier.\n\nIf there are question marks about their commercial figure, where Arsenal undoubtedly led the was in matchday income, with the £5.9m they earned from the gate more than six men’s EFL Championship clubs, per most recently available figures. It was close to double the second-highest women’s matchday income figure last season (Barcelona: £3.3m), and spoke to Arsenal’s using data analytics to appeal to attendees.\n\nNine of 11 Women’s Super League (WSL) home games were played at the Emirates Stadium, drawing average crowds of more than 34,000 and a high of 56,748 for the North London derby with Spurs last February. All 11 of Arsenal’s home league games will be played at the Emirates in 2025-26.\n\nGrowth at the gate was far from uniform, though, and after a record-breaking year of attendances in 2023-24, five WSL teams saw average gates drop. Nowhere was that more evident than at Manchester United, where a fall in attendances of a third led to a similar proportionate reduction in gate receipts.\n\nMatchday growth as a whole across the sampled clubs (excluding Paris Saint-Germain, who didn’t provide a split of revenues for last year’s edition) was just £3m, albeit that still represented a 19 per cent rise given the lowly starting point. The increase was, however, largely driven by a couple of outliers, principally Arsenal and Bayern Munich.\n\nGrowth was even more anaemic when it came to broadcast income, which stagnated as existing TV deals continued and performance-based payments offset between clubs. Lowly money from broadcast income highlights a stark juxtaposition between the women’s and men’s forms of the game. Where in the latter, hefty TV rights drove a surge in incomes and a focus on commercial revenues came later, for women’s teams, it is sponsorship deals and partnerships doing the heavy lifting.\n\nWSL teams will benefit from a new TV deal that began this season, but for the highest earners, commercial deals will remain the largest revenue driver.\n\nIn terms of league of origin, the women’s game has quickly come to mirror the men’s: the richest clubs primarily derive from England. Eight of the top 15 are from the WSL, the same number as in 2023-24.\n\nMade clear from this latest release of figures is the gulf between those at the top of women’s football and the rest. Arsenal and Chelsea surpass £20m, Barcelona are not too far off, then there is a big gap to the two Manchester clubs and Real Madrid, each of whom just topped £10m. Beyond them, the fall-off is even greater.\n\nThe revenue of women’s football’s top earners was double that of the fifth-highest earning club, and 4.8 times that of the 10th team on Deloitte’s list, Tottenham Hotspur. That dispersion of revenue has grown since 2023-24, when the highest earner generated 3.9 times the 10th-placed side.\n\nRevenue dispersion: high earner v 10th\n\nSuch disparity might sound familiar to the men’s form, but while the differences in monetary terms are far smaller, the dispersion as a multiple is higher in the women’s game. When Arsenal Women’s revenue was 4.8 times higher than Spurs last season, the huge earnings of Real Madrid in the men’s game were only 1.9 times higher than 10th-placed Chelsea in 2023-24. We will have to wait until later this week to see the men’s dispersion level for last season.\n\nRevenues in women’s football are plainly growing, and it should not be forgotten that the sport remains in almost a start-up stage. Jennifer Haskel of Deloitte’s Sport Business Group advises “the shift from the start-up phase to the established phase requires consistent time, investment and effort to develop the foundations in the right manner”.\n\nThat much is clear, and this report highlights the obvious need for women’s teams to improve matchday and broadcast incomes. Women’s teams are capitalising effectively on commercial markets men’s teams have historically not appealed to — generating more money from viewership, in person and on the sofa, is now an obvious target area.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nArsenal, Chelsea, NWSL, Sports Business, Women's Soccer\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "The AFC’s divisional round matchup between the Houston Texans and New England Patriots will likely go down as the most brutal game of this year’s playoffs. By the time each team had reached their locker room for the halftime break, there had already been a total of six turnovers committed, and neither C.J. Stroud nor Drake Maye were able to find much comfort in the pocket.\n\nNew England’s sophomore sensation endured five sacks and fumbled twice throughout the first three quarters of play, but in the end, he was still able to find Kayshon Boutte for a game-clinching 32-yard touchdown pass at the top of the fourth. Maye’s ability to overcome adversity on a routine basis has seen him draw several comparisons to his predecessor, Tom Brady, throughout the past several months.\n\nAccording to the team’s owner, Robert Kraft, there are “a lot of similarities” between the two of them that extend well beyond the football field. “They both have a sense of humility, and they are understated,” Kraft explained during his pregame appearance with NFL ESPN.\n\n“I saw Drake last year, when we had that horrible record, he did something that Tommy did in the locker room in the early years. He used to go around to every offensive lineman, even after we had a bad loss, and make, in a genuine way, make them feel he really respected what they did. Drake is such an understated, humble, young man. He comes from a great family. He married his seventh-grade sweetheart.”\n\nIn the eyes of Kraft, the best way to describe the former Tar Heel is by using the words “genuine” and “real.” If you were to ask the oddsmakers out in Las Vegas, however, they’d likely tell you that the term “Most Valuable Player” is more applicable.\n\nHaving led the league in completion percentage, yards gained per pass attempt, and passer rating, the 23-year-old closed the 2025 regular season as a slight underdog to Matthew Stafford for the regular season MVP award, but now that he’s headed to the AFC Championship, the only thing that’s on his mind right now is extending the dynasty that Brady built.\n\nFollowing their 28-16 win over the Texans, the Patriots saw their odds of winning the Super Bowl improve to +250, making them the second-largest favorite to win it all this year. The Seattle Seahawks continue to be the odds-on favorite, but seeing as the Denver Broncos will be without their QB1, Bo Nix, for next week’s match-up, New England figures to have the easiest remaining path to the title game.\n\nThat’s right, believe it or not, the Patriots are back in the conference championship for the first time since 2018. It won’t seem fair to all of the other fan bases out there, but it’s times like these where we are reminded that the gridiron doesn’t care about your feelings, and neither does Drake Maye.\n\nNew England will return to play on January 25th at Empower Field at Mile High on January 25th at 3:00 pm EST.\n\nThe post “He Married His Seventh-Grade Sweetheart”: Robert Kraft Finds ‘A Lot’ Of Similarities Between Drake Maye and Tom Brady appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "Picture the scene. An emotional Kyren Wilson is cutting a dejected and disconsolate figure in the dark and grey bowels of the York Barbican.\n\nNot only has he had family health issues to contend with, but a difficult campaign has been compounded by being forced to change the cue that he used to win the world title in 2024 - after it was damaged in a \"freak accident\".\n\nThe Englishman even says he was close to having a \"mental breakdown\" during his last-32 defeat by Elliot Slessor at the UK Championship - just last month.\n\nThen fast forward just six weeks to images of Wilson pouring out of Alexandra Palace on Sunday, as he lifted the Paul Hunter Trophy and celebrated his maiden Masters triumph with his family.\n\n\"It's amazing.

    "description": "The Hawkeyes enter the toughest stretch of their schedule yet with a huge home matchup against Michigan State",
    "fullText": "Jan Jensen and the No. 11 Iowa Women’s basketball team (15-2,6-0 B1G) begin their toughest stint of the season tonight, starting things off with a home matchup against the No. 15 Michigan State Spartans (17-1, 6-1 B1G). This stretch is going to be absolutely brutal, with the team’s games coming against Maryland, Ohio State, USC and UCLA. How they split these games could end up being the difference between Iowa hosting and not for the NCAA Tournament, so at least 2 wins here would be ideal, making tonight’s game one of the most important to win.\n\nIt will be challenging though, as Michigan State’s only loss was a stunner, losing to Wisconsin on the road in early December. The team always manages to play Iowa hard, and tonight should be no exception. Let’s hope the home court advantage helps for the Hawkeyes. They’ll need strong performances once again from Hannah Stuelke, Ava Heiden, and Chit-Chat Wright to have their best shot at the win.\n\nIt will be interesting as well to see how freshman Addie Deal follows up her career-high 18 point performance against Oregon on Thursday night. If she can consistently score in what is sure to now be an expanded role, she adds another dimension to this Iowa squad that has, at times, struggled with shot creation.\n\nEmely Rodriguez is once again out for Iowa.\n\nShould be a great game. I won’t be around too much in the comments as I’ll once again be at the game, but be respectful, have fun, and cheer us on to victory. I’ll have a post up sometime this week as well.\n\nDate: January 18, 2026\nTime: 7 p.m. CST\nMatchup: No. 11 Iowa Hawkeyes vs. No. 15 Michigan State Spartans \nLocation: Carver-Hawkeye Arena – Iowa City, IA \nTV: Big Ten Network",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe New England Patriots punched their ticket to the AFC Championship on Sunday, January 18, with a hard-fought 28-16 victory over the Houston Texans. In a game defined by a relentless Foxborough snowstorm, Mike Vrabel’s squad overcame a turnover-heavy first half to secure the franchise's first conference title berth since 2019.\n\nThe matchup lived up to its billing as a defensive slugfest. While the Texans’ top-ranked unit made life difficult for Drake Maye, forcing him into four fumbles, the Patriots’ defense proved even more opportunistic. New England feasted on a record-tying four interceptions from C.J. Stroud, including a crucial Marcus Jones pick-six that swung the momentum for good. Despite the sloppy conditions, Maye’s three touchdown passes provided the necessary spark to push the Patriots past a Houston team that had dominated the Wild Card round.\n\nWith the win, the Patriots now look ahead to a high-stakes trip to higher altitudes next Sunday, January 25. Now, a new generation takes the stage as the Patriots aim to rewrite history and claim the all-time postseason wins record for themselves.\n\nHere is more on who the Patriots play next in the 2026 NFL playoffs.\n\nNFL divisional round picks, predictions\n\nRanking eight teams remaining in 2026 NFL playoffs\n\nNFL divisional round picks against the spread\n\nWith the win, the Patriots move on to the AFC Championship, facing the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Broncos squeaked past the Buffalo Bills and Josh Allen, automatically getting home-field advantage for the AFC Championship Game. Mile High is certainly no easy place to play, and Denver earned the right to host by clinching the No. 1 overall seed. Though Denver suffered a brutal blow when starting quarterback Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury.\n\nThe matchup carries heavy foreshadowing. The last time these two storied franchises met in the AFC Championship was exactly a decade ago in January 2016. That legendary \"Mile High\" battle served as the final postseason chapter of the Tom Brady vs. Peyton Manning rivalry — a game the Broncos won 20-18 on their way to a Super Bowl title.\n\nThis time around, with a new quarterback at the helm, New England is searching for revenge.",

Stroud's four interceptions. The loss was quite a stunning one for Texans supporters and especially for analysts that predicted Houston to come out on top. ESPN's NFL Live crew, for example, all picked the Texans in an incredibly amusing segment on the show this week.\n\nAs expected, the picks backfired tremendously and the Patriots cruised to the AFC Championship.

    "description": "Trade talk is heating up in the PWHL, and the Vancouver Goldeneyes sound like they're involved.",
    "fullText": "The PWHL season is nearing the midway point and what has become abundantly clear is that teams falling behind are looking to make moves.\n\nThe only trade to date in this PWHL campaign came on the eve of the regular season when the Vancouver Goldeneyes sent Denisa Krisova to Minnesota in exchange for Anna Segedi.\n\nThere were a trio of trades on PWHL Draft day as well with New York swapping players with Toronto and Montreal, and Toronto and Vancouver also making a deal.\n\nAs the league standings continue to take shape, familiar trade partners could be in the mix again.\n\nVancouver came out of the expansion process with a roster that looked completely stacked with talent. What’s transpired since has been a run of underwhelming performances for the Goldeneyes, and the belief that despite a wealth of talent on their team, the mix isn’t working.\n\nWith Nina Jobst-Smith returning, followed by the return of Sarah Nurse, both coming back from injuries, the Vancouver Goldeneyes have experienced a influx to their roster.\n\nVancouver however, also has a group of players vastly underperforming from previous seasons who have seen their ice time on the decline as well. It's a long list for the Goldeneyes that could involve Brooke McQuigge, Michela Cava, Emma Greco, Izzy Daniel, and others.\n\nGeneral manager Cara Gardner Morey has been active in her early stages as a general manager making multiple deals, and another sounds like it's in the works.\n\nVancouver is certainly in the mix for an imminent trade.\n\nEveryone in the PWHL is open for business right now. The Ottawa Charge are believed to remain active on the trade market as they've been since the league was founded. General manager Mike Hirshfeld has made bold moves before such as a deal bringing in Jocelyne Larocque.\n\nOne area of need for the Charge remains their blueline where the Charge lack depth. With the loss of Shiann Darkangelo and Tereza Vanisova in the offseason however, secondary scoring in Ottawa has also been a concern. It's an issue that's been magnified by the early season struggles of Emily Clark, Katerina Mrazova, and Gabbie Hughes, as well as the transition time it's taking Anna Shokhina and Fanuza Kadirova to acclimatize to North America.\n\nThe Toronto Sceptres are another team who could be involved in a deal in the near future as the Sceptres continue to struggle to find chemistry both up front and on the blueline. Gina Kingsbury has pulled off multiple blockbuster deals including sending Larocque to Ottawa for Hayley Scamurra and Savannah Harmon, and the deal that brought Ella Shelton to Toronto at the draft. Kingsbury also has history with Vancouver making a draft day deal sending Kristen Campbell out west.",

    "fullText": "To begin the season, most Boston Celtics fans assumed Anfernee Simons would be used as a trade chip on or near the Feb. 5 NBA trade deadline. Simons joined Boston as part of the deal that sent Jrue Holiday to the Portland Trail Blazers. The talented scorer is in the final year of his current contract and will become an unrestricted free agent in the summer.\n\nHowever, as the season has worn on, Simons has become a key member of the Celtics' rotation. He's grown into his role as the team's sixth man and currently ranks third in the NBA for total points off the bench. Due to his consistent impact, it's looking increasingly unlikely that Stevens parts with Simons before the trade deadline, and potentially looks to re-sign him during the summer.\n\nThe problem is, if Simons isn't part of a trade, Boston's chances of landing a high-level difference-maker will take a considerable hit. That issue only grows if you expect Sam Hauser to also be off limits. With all that in mind, Jack Simone and Sam LaFrance recently discussed the tough decisions Brad Stevens is facing in the coming weeks during an episode of the \"How 'Bout Them Celtics\" podcast.\n\nYou can watch the full podcast episode by clicking on the embedded video above.\n\nWatch or listen to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSpotify: https://bit.ly/40JRevf\n\nApple: https://apple.co/45sAUBG\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf\n\nThis article originally appeared on Celtics Wire: The Celtics face a trade deadline dilemma",

    "description": "The Boston Celtics' front office has some decisions to make before the Feb. 5 trade deadline",
    "fullText": "There's just over a week until the Feb. 5 trade deadline, and Boston Celtics fans will be patiently waiting to see whether Brad Stevens decides to make a move. This season was supposed to be a gap year; however, Joe Mazzulla's coaching style has seen Boston emerge as a genuine contender in a wide-open Eastern Conference. Therefore, there are some sections of the fanbase that would like to see the Celtics become buyers before Feb. 5.\n\nThe Celtics need some additional talent at the center position, or someone who can play both the four and the five. Of course, Mazzulla must also prepare for the eventual return of Jayson Tatum, whether that be this season or next. Tatum is currently sidelined due to an Achilles tendon injury.\n\nDuring a recent episode of the \"Hardwood Knocks\" podcast, hosts Dan Favale and Bleacher Report's Grant Hughes discussed the impending trade deadline and what we can expect to see from the Celtics. Will Stevens take a big swing? Will he look to get the Celtics under the luxury tax apron? Or, is Boston set to stand pat and see how far the current roster can take them?\n\nYou can watch the full podcast episode by clicking on the embedded video above.\n\nWatch or listen to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSpotify: https://bit.ly/40JRevf\n\nApple: https://apple.co/45sAUBG\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf\n\nThis article originally appeared on Celtics Wire: What can Celtics fans expect ahead of the trade deadline?",

    "fullText": "With each passing couple months, the chances that Conor McGregor ever will fight in the UFC get slimmer and slimmer.\n\nThat's not something the former fighter or his fans likely ever would admit, or the UFC brass, for that matter, but that's just the cold, hard math.\n\nAnd if a person purporting to be McGregor is to be trusted, there may be another hint now available about his future. On a video game live stream, a person who claimed to be McGregor and sounded like the Irishman said because of the UFC's new broadcast deal with Paramount+, which eliminated the traditional pay-per-view model, his contract is, in essence, void and needs to be reworked.\n\nThat, the purported McGregor said, will take place in February.\n\nConor McGregor said he has to negotiate a new contract with the UFC next month 👀\n\n“My contract is essentially void right now.” pic.twitter.com/c7wVzFEkIG\n\n— Happy Punch (@HappyPunch) January 18, 2026\n\nIn July, it will be five years since McGregor (22-6 MMA, 10-4 UFC) last fought. He broke his leg in a second straight loss to Dustin Poirier at UFC 264. He coached Season 31 of \"The Ultimate Fighter\" opposite Michael Chandler (23-10 MMA, 2-5 UFC) and was supposed to fight him, but that never has come to fruition despite Chandler desperately pining for it, and McGregor consistently teasing it. UFC CEO Dana White recently took it off the table nearly entirely.\n\nSunday, the former UFC fighter continued his years-long spiral with a lengthy proclamation that he once again has seen the light – this time thanks to a hallucinogenic treatment in Mexico.\n\nThis past November, McGregor said he saw his own death, when it was going to happen, and how it would impact the four children he has with Dee Devlin, whom he recently married after years together. Then, he said, Jesus descended from heaven and put a crown on his head to save him during a hallucinogenic treatment in Mexico..\n\n\"To God, I am yours,\" McGregor posted on social media. \"Thank you for bestowing upon me this incredible blessing that I take with great care and absolute seriousness! I live my life per your word and nothing more.\"\n\nLast year, McGregor dropped out of a bid to become the next president of Ireland. He couldn't get support to even get his name on the ballot, so he wasn't actually in the race. McGregor has said he aspires to political office in the near future and has taken up a nationalistic right-wing rallying cry similar to Donald Trump in that pursuit. Like Trump, McGregor has multiple sexual assault accusations against him, and like Trump, a ruling against him for one, too.\n\nMcGregor was found liable for the 2018 sexual assault of Nikita Hand in a Dublin hotel. Then McGregor lost his appeal to have the decision reversed. After that, McGregor made a plea to his countrywomen and countrymen to stand with him in the wake of the mountain of civil and criminal charges against him over the years, and the civil rape and sexual assault trial that came home to roost. A poll found that just 7 percent of people said they would vote for McGregor to be president of Ireland.\n\nMcGregor also is part-owner of the BKFC and his appearances at those events are regular.\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Conor McGregor purportedly says UFC contract void in Paramount era",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are one victory away from the Super Bowl following Sunday’s 28-16 win over the Houston Texans.\n\nNew England advanced to the AFC Championship Game in a sloppy, turnover-filled triumph over Houston. Following consecutive home wins, the Patriots will travel to Denver to face the Broncos for the conference title.\n\nAfter New England’s victory, the NFL announced the details for next weekend’s matchup. The Patriots will play the Broncos on Sunday, Jan. 25, at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nCBS will televise the AFC Championship Game, and viewers can also stream it on Paramount+.\n\nThe Patriots finished the regular season third in total offense, but their defense has carried them to double-digit playoff wins. They first sacked Justin Herbert six times in a 16-3 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers before locking down the Texans in the AFC Divisional Round.\n\nHouston averaged just 3.3 yards per play, gaining a mere 48 rushing yards on 22 carries. Making matters worse, C.J. Stroud threw four interceptions — one returned for a touchdown — and lost a fumble.\n\nThe Patriots will look to improve to 9-0 on the road when playing the Broncos, who survived a 33-30 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills. But the AFC West champions suffered a huge loss in the process, as quarterback Bo Nix broke his ankle at the end of the game.\n\nThat places former Patriots reserve Jarrett Stidham in line to make his fifth career start. The former fourth-round pick has a 78.3 passer rating with eight touchdowns and eight interceptions.\n\nJason Kelce Celebrates ‘Pitbull’ Patriots Defensive Standout",

    "fullText": "The Australian Open is now underway, with plenty of upsets having already taken place in Melbourne.\n\nOn the ATP Tour, 20th seed Flavio Cobolli lost in the first round to Arthur Fery, who emerged through qualifying.\n\nAmerican hopeful Sebastian Korda also lost his first match, as did seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams on the WTA Tour.\n\nDefending champion Jannik Sinner will soon take on Hugo Gaston, while Madison Keys begins her title defence against Oleksandra Oliynykova.\n\nKeys’ chances of defending her title have now been discussed by former player Rennae Stubbs, who said on her podcast: “I don’t think she’s going to defend.\n\n“And the reason I say that, it’s not because she’s not capable, she’s arguably the best hitter of the ball in women’s tennis.\n\n“But she hasn’t had the same lead-up. She won Adelaide playing probably the best tennis of her life, came in here super confident.\n\n“Whereas she’s had a lot of injuries, she’s had an iteration to her service motion again. So I just think that she just doesn’t quite have the same confidence she had last year.\n\n“So I just don’t see her defending her title this year. I see Amanda [Anisimova] being the one who gets through there.”\n\nKeys lifted the trophy in Adelaide before the 2025 Australian Open, where she claimed her maiden Grand Slam title.\n\nAt this year’s Adelaide International, the American beat Tereza Valentova before losing her quarterfinal to Victoria Mboko.\n\nAnother player Stubbs was tasked with discussing was Naomi Osaka, who like Keys is a former Australian Open champion.\n\nShe has, however, won the Grand Slam twice and is a four-time Grand Slam champion in total, while she is also a former world number one.\n\nBut Stubbs said of Osaka: “Look, I just think again, she just doesn’t have the tennis under her belt that she needs coming in here.\n\n“Can she beat anyone on any given day? Absolutely. Naomi Osaka is a four-time champion of a major title.\n\n“She knows how to win them. But everyone is so good now, and she has to get more tennis under her belt.\n\n“I just don’t think she’s quite there enough to beat an Iga Swiatek or an [Elena] Rybakina or any of these players. But then again, who knows? We know she’s capable. She has the tools, that’s for sure.”\n\nOsaka, who warmed up for the Australian Open by playing for Japan at the United Cup, meets Antonia Ruzic in round one in Melbourne.",

    "fullText": "Sadio Mane was the hero for Senegal once again, but not for the reasons you would expect.\n\nThe former Liverpool and Bayern Munich forward claimed his second Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) crown on Sunday, with the Teranga Lions beating host nation Morocco in a final filled with controversy.\n\nIn stoppage time, Senegal head coach Pape Thiaw tried to usher his team off the field after Morocco were awarded a penalty in the 98th minute when defender El Hadji Malick Diouf brought down Brahim Diaz.\n\nWith the Senegal players back in the changing rooms, Mane was pictured entering and then ushering them back out on to the pitch, with the help of goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.\n\nRoughly 16 minutes after the spot-kick was awarded, Diaz's Panenka penalty was easily caught by Mendy in a nightmare moment for one of the stars of the tournament.\n\nAt 0-0 the game went to extra time. Pape Gueye rocketed in a winner and sealed a dramatic title.\n\nMane, who has said this will be his last Afcon, goes out as a leader - having been presented with the captain's armband by his team-mates before the trophy was lifted.\n\nHe told African media: \"Yes, it was I who convinced the team to return to the field.\n\n\"The players and the coach had decided to withdraw, and I didn't understand that decision, but finally, I told everyone to return immediately and to play no matter the cost.\"\n\nFormer Nigeria forward Daniel Amokachi told BBC World Service: \"Mane went the extra mile to get his team back and it has paid off.\n\n\"What an ambassador for football he is. We know the kind of person he is off the pitch and he knows what football is all about.\"\n\nFormer Morocco international Hassan Kachloul said \"Africa football and world football were losing\" until Mane intervened.\n\n\"What I like more than anything, the only player from the Senegalese team was Sadio Mane,\" he told E4.\n\n\"That shows the great man he is. He went back to the dressing room and brought those players back. Mane was the man to bring them back on.\"\n\nSenegal walk off in Afcon final over penalty award\n\nAfcon 2025: Senegal are champions after final descends into chaos\n\nFor Mane, it all started in Bambali.\n\nIt was in south-west Senegal that he began playing football on its red earth-lined streets and sandy pitches and where, aged 13, he watched Liverpool's famous comeback against AC Milan in the Champions League final in 2005.\n\nSince then he has gone on to lift both that prestigious trophy and the Premier League with the Reds, as well as claiming two Afcon titles with the Teranga Lions.\n\nMane scored the winning penalty against Egypt in the final of the 2021 edition and described it as \"the best day of my life and the best trophy of my life\".\n\nA stadium was named after him in the city of Sedhiou, just under 20km from his hometown, following that triumph as a recognition of his achievements.\n\nNow a two-time champion and 33 years old, Mane has capped off his Afcon career on an ultimate high.\n\nBut Gueye says the squad aim to convince Mane, who he called \"a legend of Senegal\", to change his mind about this being his final Afcon and remain with the team for at least the 2027 edition in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.\n\n\"We're going to try to keep him with us a bit longer, because he still has some great years to give,\" the 26-year-old Villarreal man told BBC Afrique.\n\n\"I heard what he said and we'll see what he decides to do. But we really want him to stay with us for many more years.\"\n\nMane, now plying his trade in Saudi Arabia with Al-Nassr, may have a glittering trophy cabinet but he has never forgotten his roots.\n\nHe won hearts with charitable acts in Bambali by pledging money to build a hospital and school, contributing to the construction of mosques and providing funds to aid the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHe also sent 300 Liverpool shirts to his hometown before the Anfield club's appearance in the 2018 Champions League final, which Real Madrid ultimately won 3-1.\n\n\"If Sadio comes here, he behaves very humbly, on a level with the people in Bambali,\" Fode Boucar Dahaba, the president of a regional league, told BBC Sport Africa on a visit to the village a few years ago.\n\n\"He doesn't want to stand out. The village gives all this love back to him.\"\n\nFamily members describe him as someone who is \"working for everybody\" and a \"good Muslim\".\n\nThat was evident during his time in England's top flight, when he helped clean the toilets at a mosque in Toxteth after one Liverpool victory.\n\n\"He wanted to remain discreet and wasn't doing it for publicity,\" said Abu Usamah Al-Tahabi, the imam at Al Rahma Mosque.\n\n\"He's not a person looking for fanfare. There's no arrogance.\"\n\nSenegal centre-back Moussa Niakhate hailed Mane as \"an incredible man\" in the lead-up to the final.\n\n\"I won't have enough time to describe what Sadio represents for African football, and more particularly for the Senegalese people,\" he added.\n\nMane has over 120 caps and is his country's record goalscorer with 53 goals.\n\nHe has so often been the hero on the pitch in recent years, and he intends to play at the World Cup later this year, where more great memories could be made.\n\nHe had an early penalty kick saved during the first half of the 2021 Afcon final but stepped up again to decide the shootout with Egypt in Yaounde.\n\nA little over a month later he settled their 2022 Fifa World Cup play-off against the Pharaohs in the same way - after that match also went the distance - although he ultimately missed out on the tournament in Qatar through injury.\n\nHe has mainly been a creative force at this year's Afcon finals, but his 78th-minute strike against Egypt, who were once again on the receiving end of Mane's magic, proved enough to send the Teranga Lions through to the final.\n\n\"That's what we expect from him,\" midfielder Idrissa Gana Gueye told the BBC World Service after his decisive intervention in Tangier on Wednesday.\n\n\"[He is] a big player and he needs to show it in big games. He showed it again.\"\n\nMane may have a humble demeanour and does not captain Senegal, but when he speaks his team-mates take note.\n\n\"In his pre-match speech [before playing Egypt] he motivated all of us,\" Pape Gueye said.\n\n\"He had the right words to make sure we went into the match fully focused.\n\n\"He has the experience of big matches, so he also knows how to calm us down. You can see it a lot in his gestures - he tells us to stay calm, even after we score or if we concede a goal.\"\n\nMane won the vast majority of his international caps under Aliou Cisse, who was in charge of the West Africans from 2015 to 2024, but current coach Pape Thiaw is understandably keen for his talisman to remain part of the national set-up.\n\n\"I think he made his decision in the heat of the moment and the country does not agree, and I as coach of the national team do not agree at all,\" Thiaw said.\n\n\"We would like to keep him for as long as possible.\"\n\nAll you need to know about Afcon 2025",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich’s Konrad Laimer spoke to the Bundesliga’s website in a recent interview. As part of the interview, he was asked what phase of his career he was in right now — both on the pitch and and from a personal perspective. @MiaSanMia recorded what he had to say to the league.\n\nThe Austrian international talked about getting older and what he has experienced. He responded with, “It’s always a bit tougher at a certain age. I’m 28, I’ve already experienced a fair bit. I’ve already played quite a few games and, yes, time always seems to pass so quickly. I actually still feel very young. You do notice that you’re a bit older, but it’s fun. I feel great and I feel I have many, many years left in me.”\n\nLaimer went on to talk about he can do to continue to play. “The most important thing is to look after your body. That’s a good thing when you’ve been playing football for a few years. I know what suits me, I know what doesn’t suit me. I know what I need, even during long weeks with tough games, to perform at 100 percent. At the moment, everything feels really, really good.”\n\nLaimer has a lot to look forward to at the moment. Bayern is clicking in all three competitions while Austria is prepping for a tough World Cup group. While Argentina will be the toughest, Argentina will have a great chance to move on to the knockout rounds. Laimer has a chance to be a pivotal part of both team’s successes.",

    "fullText": "Senegal beat Morocco to win the Africa Cup of Nations for a second time - but only after the final was overshadowed when they temporarily refused to play after the hosts were awarded a controversial stoppage-time penalty with the match goalless.\n\nVillarreal midfielder Pape Gueye scored the only goal in the fourth minute of extra time to seal a second triumph in five years for the Lions.\n\nBut the game was marred by late controversy as Senegal head coach Pape Thiaw tried to usher his team off the field when Morocco were awarded a spot-kick in the 98th minute as a result of defender El Hadji Malick Diouf bringing down Brahim Diaz.\n\nThough when the penalty was eventually taken in the 114th minute, Real Madrid forward Diaz saw his Panenka attempt saved by Edouard Mendy.\n\nIn his post-match press conference, Morocco coach Walid Regragui said Senegal's actions were \"shameful\" and do not \"honour Africa\".\n\nThiaw, meanwhile, saw his media briefing cancelled after a ruckus broke out in the press room.\n\nBut in an interview with BeIN Sport, he accepted that he should not have ordered his team off the field.\n\n\"We didn't agree,\" he said. \"I don't want to go over all the incidents. I apologise for the football.\n\n\"After reflecting on it I made them come back [on the pitch] - you can react in the heat of the moment. We accept the errors of the referee.\n\n\"We shouldn't have done it but it's done and now we present our apologies to football.\"\n\nThiaw, 44, was furious with referee Jean Jacques Ndala - who awarded the penalty after reviewing the incident on the VAR monitor - for ruling out a goal for his side moments earlier.\n\nCrystal Palace forward Ismaila Sarr had bundled home from close range, but his effort was chalked off for a foul by Abdoulaye Seck on Achraf Hakimi.\n\nAs several of the Senegal players followed Thiaw's request to leave the field, a section of their supporters threw objects and attempted to get on the field.\n\nSenegal only returned from the dressing room at the request of former Liverpool forward Sadio Mane.\n\nGueye then scored the only goal of the game with a stunning individual effort in the 94th minute.\n\nDiaz, substituted in the extra time, was left crestfallen as Morocco missed the chance to win a first Afcon title since 1976.\n\nAfter the game, Mendy insisted he was \"proud\" of the way Senegal - instructed by Mane - returned to the field to win their second Afcon title this decade.\n\n\"What did we say to each other? That's between us,\" said Mendy.\n\n\"We did it together and we came back together, that's all that matters. We can be proud tonight.\"\n\nMatch-winner Gueye added: \"We had a feeling of injustice. Just before the penalty we thought we should have had a goal and the referee didn't go to VAR.\n\n\"Sadio [Mane] told us to come back on and we remobilised. Edouard [Mendy] then made the save, we stayed focused, got the goal and won the game.\"\n\n'An ambassador for African football' - Mane is Senegal's Afcon hero\n\nDiaz will 'have nightmares' over Panenka failure\n\nAfcon 2025: Senegal are champions after final descends into chaos\n\nIt's an awful way for a tournament which had felt like such a great advert for African football to end.\n\nI couldn't believe the chaos I was witnessing from the commentary box, with some fans trying to get on to the pitch to my left and members of staff being separated down below me in the technical areas.\n\nThen the Senegal players walking down the tunnel. It was a terrible look for the Cup of Nations.\n\nIf I look back at the past few weeks covering this event there has been a huge amount of debate - more than most years - about refereeing decisions and VAR, with accusations from some journalists and fans that hosts Morocco were getting the rub of the green from some officials.\n\nIt even got to a point where refereeing appointments for certain games were becoming a talking point on social media, which put a lot of pressure on the officials before certain games.\n\nSenegal's complaints about the way they'd been treated leading up to the final - including what they felt was a lack of security when they arrived in Rabat on Friday and their lack of tickets - also increased the tension going into this game.\n\nNobody expected the scenes we witnessed after the penalty was awarded though, and this was all in front of the Fifa president Gianni Infantino who was here to present the trophy to the winning side.\n\nMorocco have been praised for the way they've organised this tournament - including from the big names like Mohamed Salah - with impressive infrastructure, stadiums and travel links.\n\nSadly for them though, with four years to go until they co-host the World Cup, the astonishing scenes before the Diaz penalty will probably be what will be most remembered about this tournament.\n\nThere is very little positive to say about the end of this game, but one person to come out of it well is Mane.\n\nHe was the one Senegal player who clearly did not want to walk down the tunnel and was telling his team-mates to come back out.\n\nHe also walked over to the Senegal fans after the full-time whistle, begging them to calm down.\n\nThere is now a line of armoured police in front of those fans to my left. It's been quite violent down there on several occasions.\n\nBefore Sunday's final in Rabat, the Senegal Football Federation (FSF) expressed \"serious concerns\" over the security of the team.\n\nThe 2021 winners were swarmed by fans when the team bus arrived in the Moroccan capital on Friday.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, the FSF also complained about the conditions of the hotel, number of tickets allocated to supporters and the fact that they were not offered a training pitch at Morocco's team base.\n\nThey said a \"lack of adequate security\" left players and staff \"at risk\".\n\n\"What happened yesterday was not normal,\" said Thiaw in his pre-match news conference.\n\n\"Given the number there, anything could have happened. My players could have been in danger.\n\n\"That type of thing should not happen between two brother countries.\"\n\nFormer Nigeria forward Efan Ekoku criticised Thiaw and his players, insisting their temporary refusal to play was \"not a good look for African football\".\n\n\"It [the penalty award] was soft,\" Ekoku told E4. \"It was foolish and reckless by El Hadji Malick Diouf, but the decision had been made and the players have to abide by that.\n\n\"You cannot do that [leave the pitch]. However aggrieved you feel at it you have got to let the referee and the rules [make the decision]... I have got some sympathy, but this is not a good look.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria's 2013 winner John Obi Mikel said he could \"understand the frustration\" but walking off is \"not what I want to see\".\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Brahim Diaz had the chance to win Afcon for Morocco, but his choice to try a Panenka ended up costing his side dearly as Senegal hit back to win the game in extra time.",
    "fullText": "It was a moment that will haunt Brahim Diaz for years to come.\n\nThe winger had a chance to write his name into Moroccan folklore after winning a penalty in the eighth minute of second-half added time with Africa Cup of Nations final against Senegal goalless.\n\nIt was a golden opportunity to end his country's 50-year wait to lift the Afcon trophy.\n\nBut Diaz, whose five goals had propelled the hosts to the final, tried a 'Panenka' chipped penalty. It backfired. Horrendously so. Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy stood his ground and caught the ball in embarrassingly simple fashion.\n\nThe former Manchester City player and tournament's top-scorer looked distraught as it began to sink in what he had done. Later, television cameras zoomed in on him on the Morocco bench, after he had been substituted in extra time, holding back tears.\n\nThe Real Madrid attacker had been made to wait around 17 minutes to take the kick after the majority of Senegal's players, including Mendy, marched off the pitch in protest at the award of the penalty.\n\n\"He had a lot of time before taking the penalty which must have disturbed him,\" said Morocco manager Walid Regragui.\n\n\"But we can't change what happened. That is how he chose to take the penalty. We need to look forwards now.\"\n\nDiaz's penalty turned out to be the last kick of normal time.\n\nFour minutes into extra time, Senegal's Pape Gueye lashed in what turned out to be the winner to leave Diaz and his Morocco team-mates heartbroken.\n\n\"I think Brahim Diaz is going to have a lot of nightmares in the coming days,\" former Morocco midfielder Hassan Kachloul said on Channel 4's coverage of the match.\n\nFormer Nigeria forward Daniel Amokachi added: \"Brahim Diaz threw away all of his glorious moments, scoring five goals in this tournament.\"\n\nAnd ex-Nigeria midfielder Jon Obi Mikel said the miss \"spoils everything Brahim Diaz has done well in this tournament\".\n\n\"He is going to be devastated,\" he added. \"This is going to be tough on him, for weeks, for months.\"\n\nEfan Ekoku, another former Nigeria international, said: \"It is a moment Brahim Diaz will never get over.\"\n\nSenegal win Afcon after chaotic final against Morocco\n\nSenegal walk off in Afcon final over penalty award\n\nAfcon 2025 podcast: Senegal are champions after final descends into chaos\n\nThe final was goalless deep into added time at the end of the second half when Diaz El Hadji Malick Diouf appeared to drag Diaz to the ground by his neck.\n\nDR Congo referee Jean-Jacques Ndala was sent to the pitchside monitor by the video assistant referee and, after a quick check, pointed to the penalty spot in the 98th minute.\n\nAlready incensed after a decision to disallow a Senegal goal in the 93rd minute, head coach Pape Thiaw tried to usher his team off the field, and several Senegal players left for the dressing room.\n\nFormer Liverpool striker Sadio Mane stayed on the pitch and tried to coax his Senegal team-mates back on to finish the match.\n\nWhen the penalty was eventually taken in the 114th minute, Diaz saw his tame attempt saved by Mendy.\n\nPape Gueye put Senegal in front four minutes into extra time. A few minutes later Diaz was substituted.\n\nThe last time Morocco won Afcon was the same year the first Panenka penalty was attempted.\n\nCzechoslovakia beat West Germany in the Euro 1976 final with probably the most famous penalty kick in history. During the shootout, midfielder Antonin Panenka waited for the goalkeeper to dive and then casually chipped the ball down the middle of the goal.\n\nSince the original, the 'Panenka' has been repeated and proven as a bona-fide - if high-risk - tactic by some of the biggest names on the most momentous occasions.\n\nZinedine Zidane scored one for France in the 2006 World Cup final, beating Italy keeper Gianluigi Buffon with an effort that went in off the crossbar.\n\nAndrea Pirlo cooly clipped one past Joe Hart as Italy beat England on penalties in the Euro 2012 quarter-final. Sergio Ramos followed suit as Spain knocked Portugal out of the semi-finals of the same tournament.\n\nLionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Thierry Henry, Neymar and Zlatan Ibrahimovic have all pulled it off.\n\nBut Diaz isn't the only player to see their attempt backfire on football's biggest stage. Zidane and Pirlo both missed Panenka's earlier in their career. Sergio Aguero, Raheem Sterling and Peter Crouch have all tried and failed.\n\nIn January, Brentford goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher made light work of an attempt in the Premier League by Sunderland's Enzo Le Fee.\n\nAdemola Lookman's dreadful attempt with the last kick of the game in a 1-0 defeat by West Ham in 2020 is up there with one of the worst Panenka penalties seen in recent years.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

Denver held on for a 33-30 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills in an instant classic in Saturday's divisional round game. Unfortunately, starting quarterback Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury in the extra frame and will be out for Denver's next game against the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship.\n\nThat means that backup QB Jarrett Stidham will get his first playoff start.\n\nDrake Maye led the Patriots — aided by five C.J.

That would be the biggest home underdog for a No. 1 seed in a conference championship game since at least 1970, per Sports Odds History. The total was set at 40.5 points.\n\nIt's Denver's first appearance in an AFC title game since 2016.",

    "description": "Diaz inexplicably went for a ‘Panenka’ attempt in the 24th minute of stoppage time and his weak penalty sailed tamely into the arms of Mendy",
    "fullText": "Brahim Diaz was left in tears after his fluffed ‘Panenka’-style penalty cost Morocco their first Africa Cup of Nations title in 50 years in a chaotic final against Senegal.\n\nThe Real Madrid midfielder contentiously won the spot-kick deep into second-half stoppage time with the game still goalless, giving the Atlas Lions a golden opportunity to snatch the continental crown.\n\nHowever, Senegal responded to the VAR verdict by staging a walk-off in protest, with manager Pape Thiaw ordering his players back into the dressing room in a 16-minute hiatus.\n\nWhen the Senegalese players were finally persuaded to re-emerge from the tunnel by talisman Sadio Mane, Diaz stepped up to the plate to take the spot-kick, only for goalkeeper Edouard Mendy to speak persistently to the 26-year-old to further delay the penalty.\n\nDiaz then inexplicably went for a ‘Panenka’ in the 24th minute of stoppage time and his weak penalty sailed tamely into the arms of Mendy.\n\nWith the game forced to extra time as a result, Pape Sarr went on to score the winner in stunning fashion for Senegal in the 94th minute, with his rocket of an effort proving the difference and denying the tournament hosts a first Afcon title since 1976.\n\nThe midfielder, who was substituted early into extra time, was seen in tears at full-time and looked completely dejected as he received the golden boot award from Fifa president Gianni Infantino, with his tally of five goals enough to see him end the tournament as top scorer.\n\nMendy was asked about his encounter with Diaz before the penalty was taken, replying: \"What did we say to each other? That's between us. We did it together and we came back together, that's all that matters. We can be proud tonight.”\n\nNigeria legend John Obi Mikel was left fearing the impact the performance could have on the player, who has seen an otherwise fantastic Afcon campaign ruined.\n\n“To do that it spoils everything Brahim Diaz has done well in this tournament. He is going to be devastated. This is going to be tough on him, for weeks, for months,” Mikel told E4.\n\n“Again, it is a shame to see. Brahim Diaz has had a superb tournament. He scored five goals and he has been the star man. It is sad to see him do such a thing. Just put your foot through it.”",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots continued their remarkable turnaround this season by beating the Houston Texans 28-16 to reach the AFC Championship game.\n\nAfter winning just four games in his rookie season, quarterback Drake Maye led the Patriots to a 14-3 record and an unexpected play-off appearance.\n\nThe 23-year-old is a leading contender to be named the NFL's Most Valuable Player and overcame both snow and the vaunted Texans defence to win Sunday's Divisional Round game in Massachusetts.\n\nThat secured the Patriots' first AFC Championship game since 2019, when legendary quarterback Tom Brady and New England claimed their sixth Super Bowl victory.\n\nHouston's defence was ranked as the NFL's best this season and although the Texans claimed their first play-off win on the road last week, they have suffered a third straight exit at this stage.\n\nThe Patriots will be on away territory next week as they travel to face the Denver Broncos, the AFC's top seed, for a place in Super Bowl 60 on Sunday, 8 February.\n\nNFL play-offs: Patriots reach AFC Championship game, Rams v Bears to come\n\nMike Vrabel was Brady's team-mate for three of those Super Bowl wins and in his first season as New England's head coach, the Patriots claimed 10 more wins than in 2024 - tied for the biggest turnaround in NFL history.\n\nThe Patriots have been one of this season's best all-round teams, claiming the AFC's second seed and their first AFC East division title in seven years in Brady's last season in New England.\n\nIn Maye, the Patriots have finally found Brady's long-term successor. He is a year younger than the record seven-time Super Bowl winner was when he claimed his first NFL title in 2002, and in this match, the quarterback again showed a maturity beyond his years.\n\nBoth he and opposite number CJ Stroud struggled with the wintry conditions and Maye had four fumbles, two of them resulting in turnovers. He also had one interception and was sacked five times by Houston's fearsome pass rush.\n\nHowever, he also delivered three touchdown passes, two of them to help establish a 21-10 lead at half-time and the latter a 32-yard deep shot in the fourth quarter to Kayshon Boutte, who made a superb one-handed grab to seal victory.\n\nMeanwhile, after throwing just eight interceptions in 14 games during the regular season, Houston's third-year quarterback Stroud had four interceptions in the first half alone, with one of them returned for a touchdown by Marcus Jones.\n\nIronically, Maye will now go up against Jarrett Stidham, who was initially seen as Brady's successor when drafted in 2019 and was back-up for the legendary quarterback's final season in New England.\n\nAfter joining Denver in 2023, 29-year-old Stidham is now set for only the fifth start of his NFL career because Broncos' first-choice quarterback Bo Nix suffered a broken ankle in their Divisional Round win over Buffalo on Saturday.\n\nConference seed in brackets, all kick-off times GMT\n\nLos Angeles Rams (5) @ Chicago Bears (2) - 23:30\n\nAFC Championship: New England Patriots (2) @ Denver Broncos (1) - 20:00\n\nNFC Championship: Rams or Bears @ Seattle Seahawks (1) - 23:30\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "Heart Rate Variability",
    "description": "Your heart rate variability (HRV) is a powerful metric of your overall health. HRV measures the difference in time between each heartbeat, which fluctuates slightly. High HRV is generally considered better. Low HRV can be caused by medical conditions, stress, or intense fitness training.",
    "fullText": "Your heart rate variability (HRV) is a powerful—if complex—metric of your overall health. Your Apple Watch automatically measures HRV, including while sleeping. We’ll try to give an overview here, but you could really write a whole book on what HRV means.\n\nA healthy heart is not a metronome: as your heart beats, the timing between each beat shifts slightly. For example, one heart beat may come 900 millseconds after another, and then the next one 950 millseconds after that. That’s healthy and good.\n\nYour HRV measures the variation in time between these heart beats. The unit of HRV is millseconds, and a normal HRV is 18-76ms.\n\nWhile HRV is derived from heart rate, it’s actually a broader window into your overall health.\n\nThe main influence on HRV is your autonomic nervous system (ANS). Since your ANS is connected to your liver, kidney, stomach, brain, and more, HRV is actually a really powerful metric of many different organ systems in your body. We’ll cover the autonomic nervous system more below, including the how HRV sometimes reflects medical conditions like anxiety, depression, dysautonomia, digestive tract problems, and more.\n\nAnything between 18 to 76 ms is a normal heart rate variability. Within 18-76ms, higher HRVs are usually better.\n\nDepending on age and sex, below 18 ms is a low HRV. This is around the bottom 10%. An HRV above 76 ms would put you in the 90th percentile of Apple Watch users.\n\nThe Apple Watch measures the time of each heart beat using its optical heart rate sensor. Apple Watch calculates HRV using SDNN: the standard deviation between normal-to-normal heart beat intevals.\n\nSDNN is defined mathematically as:\n\nSDNN = sqrt(Σ(NN_i - mean(NN))² / (N - 1))\n\nHere’s an example. Let’s say your heart is beating around 60bpm. The spacing between heart beats isn’t going to be exactly 1 second—it will vary a little bit, beat to beat. Let’s say the first heart beat comes, then a second one 1040 ms later, then a third heart beat 960 ms later, then a final heart beat exactly 1000ms later. Your NN intervals are then 1040ms, 960ms, and 1000ms.\n\nYour average N-N (normal to normal) interval is 1000ms. The standard deviation is 32.6 ms. That means your HRV\nis 32.6 ms, using the SDNN method. Other wearables like Whoop use different formulas for HRV, such as RMSSD, which we’ll explain now.\n\nThere are several formulas to calculate HRV. The two most common are SDNN (used by Apple Watch) and RMSSD:\n\nHRV is influenced by your autonomic nervous system, which has two branches: the sympathetic nervous system (your “fight or flight” response) and the parasympathetic nervous system (your “rest and digest” response, which is controlled by the vagus nerve). When the sympathetic nervous system dominates, HRV is lower. When the parasympathetic nervous system dominates, HRV is higher.\n\nA low or high HRV can have many meanings and causes, including mental health, dysautonomia, diabetes, or simply stress. Let’s go\nthrough each potential cause.\n\nA common cause of temporary low HRV on your Apple Watch is stress or intense fitness training. However, medical conditions\ncan also cause low HRVs (or high HRVs). The most common conditions that affect HRV are dysautonomia, anxiety, depression, nerve damage, abnormal heart rhythms, and some gut health conditions.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of dysautonomia is imbalance between the sympathetic nervous system (often overactive) and the parasympathetic nervous system (often withdrawn). People with dysautonomia, POTS, and Long Covid often haver low HRV. While HRV itself is not used in diagnosis of POTS, the pattern of heart rate and blood pressure when going from laying to standing is. You can book an appointment with an Empirical Health doctor\nto get POTS testing and treatment.\n\nLow HRV can sometimes be a sign of depression or anxiety. Improving HRV through practices like mindfulness, physical activity, stress management, and medication can support better emotional regulation and mental health.\n\nNerve damage (for example, from diabetes) can cause low HRV. Nerve damage affects HRV by disrupting the balance and communication between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. When nerves responsible for these regulatory pathways are damaged, the body’s ability to adjust heart rate in response to stressors and environmental changes becomes impaired. This leads to a decrease in HRV.\n\nFinally, very low or high HRV can also be caused by an electrical problem in the heart (for example, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or supraventricular tachycardia). In these cases, an ECG can give more diagnostic information on exactly what is happening in the heart’s electrical system.\n\nThe image above shows two common abnormal heart rhythms, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, on an ECG. Atrial fibrillation is highly irregular, leading to high HRV. Atrial flutter is very regular, leading to no or low HRV. Either of these rhythms require attention from a medical professional.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 4 and above include an FDA-cleared ECG sensor that can help distinguish whether low or high HRV is caused by an abnormal heart rhythm. The current Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 9 (released in 2025) both include the ECG sensor, but not\nthe Apple Watch SE3.\n\nSince the vagus nerve is connected with your stomach, intenstines, liver, and so on, low HRV can sometimes be correlated with problems in the digestive tract.\n\nBecause HRV correlates with so much in the body, it’s a powerful metric but doesn’t give specific diagnostic information on exactly what’s wrong. If you have concerns or questions about HRV, it’s best to talk with a doctor about your specific medical situation. You can book an appointment through the Empirical Health app.\n\nWhat is HRV and what does it have to do with health?\n\nRaquel Rodriguez Martinez, MD, MPP\n\nYour guide to Apple Watch's heart rate monitor",

    "fullText": "CAIRO (AP) — A dividing line, at times invisible, can mean life or death for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThose sheltering near the territory's “yellow line” that the Israeli military withdrew to as part of the October ceasefire say they live in fear as Israeli soldiers direct near-daily fire at anyone who crosses or even lingers near it.\n\nOf the 447 Palestinians killed between the ceasefire taking effect and Tuesday, at least 77 were killed by Israeli gunfire near the line, including 62 who crossed it, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Among them were teenagers and young children, The Associated Press found.\n\nAnd although the military has placed some yellow barrels and concrete barriers delineating the limits of the Palestinian zone, the line is still unmarked in certain places and in others was laid nearly half a kilometer (0.3 miles) deeper than what was agreed to in the ceasefire deal, expanding the part of Gaza that Israel controls, according to Palestinians and mapping experts.\n\n“We stay away from the barrels. No one dares to get close” said Gaza City resident Ahmed Abu Jahal, noting that the markers are less than 100 meters (110 yards) from his house — instead of the roughly 500 meters (546 yards) outlined in a map put out by the Israeli military.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the military had acknowledged killing 57 people around the yellow line, saying most were militants. It said its troops are complying with the rules of engagement in order to counter militant groups, and are informing Palestinians of the line’s location and marking it on the ground to “reduce friction and prevent misunderstandings.”\n\nUnder the ceasefire, Israel withdrew its troops to a buffer zone that is up to 7 kilometers (4 miles) deep and includes most of Gaza's arable land, its elevated points and all of its border crossings. That hems more than 2 million Palestinians into a strip along the coastline and central Gaza.\n\nPeople of all ages, some already dead, have been showing up almost daily at the emergency room of Gaza City's Al-Ahli hospital with bullet wounds from straying near the line, said hospital director Fadel Naeem.\n\nAmid the vast destruction in Gaza, the demarcation line often isn't easy to detect, Naeem said. He recounted picking his way through undamaged paths during a recent visit to the southern city of Khan Younis. He didn't notice he was almost across the line until locals shouted at him to turn back, he said.\n\nThe Israeli military said most of the people it has killed crossing the line posed a threat to its troops. According to a military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military rules, troops issue audible warnings and then fire warning shots whenever someone crosses the line. Many civilians retreat when warning shots are fired, though some have been killed, the official acknowledged.\n\nKilled while playing near the line\n\nZaher Shamia, 17, lived with his grandfather in a tent 300 meters (330 yards) from the line in northern Gaza’s Jabaliya refugee camp. On Dec. 10, he was playing with his cousin and some friends near the line, according to video he took before his death.\n\nSuddenly, shots rang out and the video stopped. Soldiers approaching the line with an armored bulldozer had fired on the teens, hitting Zaher, said a witness.\n\nA neighbor eventually found Zaher’s body, which had been crushed by the bulldozer, said Zaher's grandfather, Kamal al-Beih: “We only recognized him from his head.\"\n\nTwo doctors, Mohamed Abu Selmiya and Rami Mhanna, confirmed that the teen had been killed by gunshots and then run over by a bulldozer. The military official said he was aware that Shamia was a civilian and that the military was looking into it.\n\nMaram Atta said that on Dec. 7, her 3-year-old daughter, Ahed al-Bayouk, was playing with siblings outside of their tent, which was near the yellow line along Gaza's southern coast. Atta was preparing lentils when she heard aircraft overhead, then shots.\n\nA stray projectile whizzed close to her and struck Ahed, who was dead before they reached the clinic.\n\n“I lost my daughter to what they keep calling a ‘ceasefire’” said Atta, crying. “What ceasefire are they talking about?”\n\nA military official denied the killing.\n\nThe line's exact location is ambiguous, differing on maps put out by the Israeli military and the White House.\n\nNeither matches the line troops appear to be marking on the ground, according to Palestinians and geolocation specialists.\n\nChris Osiek, an open source intelligence analyst and consultant, has geolocated a number of yellow blocks based on social media videos. He found at least four urban areas where troops set the blocks several hundred meters deeper into Gaza than the military map-specified yellow line.\n\n“This is basically what you get when you simply let Trump make an image and post it on Truth Social and let the IDF make their own,” he said, using the acronym for the military. “If it’s not a proper system, with coordinates that make it easy for people to navigate where it is, then you leave the ambiguity free for the IDF to interpret the yellow line how they basically want.”\n\nThe military official dismissed such criticism, saying any deviations from the map amount to just a few meters. But to Palestinians hemmed in by widespread destruction and displacement, every few meters lost is another house that can't be sheltered in — another they doubt will ever be returned.\n\n‘The line is getting very close’\n\nUnder the ceasefire, Israeli forces are only supposed to remain at the yellow line until a fuller withdrawal, though the agreement doesn't give a timeline for that. With the next steps in the deal lagging and troops digging into positions on the Israeli side, though, Palestinians wonder if they are witnessing a permanent land takeover.\n\nIn December, Israel’s defense minister described the yellow line as “a new border line — serving as a forward defensive line for our communities and a line of operational activity.”\n\nThe military has continued leveling buildings inside the Israeli-held zone, turning already damaged neighborhoods to moonscapes. Almost all of the city of Rafah, on Gaza's border with Egypt, has been razed over the past year. The army says this is necessary to destroy tunnels and prepare the area for reconstruction.\n\nIn some places, demolitions since the ceasefire have encroached beyond the official yellow line. Since November, troops have leveled a swath of Gaza City’s Tuffah neighborhood extending some 300 meters (330 yards) outside the Israeli-held zone, according to Oct. 14 and Dec. 18 satellite photos provided by Planet Labs.\n\nAbu Jahal moved back to his damaged house in Tuffah at the ceasefire's start. He said he frequently saw new yellow barrels appear and the military forcing out anyone living on its side of the markers.\n\nOn Jan. 7, Israeli fire hit a house near him, and the residents had to evacuate, he said. Abu Jahal said his family — including his wife, their child, and seven other relatives — may also have to leave soon.\n\n“The line is getting very close,” he said.",

    "fullText": "China is now a key market for global carmakers, and, surprisingly, buyers there are shifting back to sedans that offer serious tech. Automakers are pushing boundaries to get noticed, and Nissan is one of them. The brand launched two new electrified sedans and a refreshed Teana late last year – the latter being the more premium take on the Altima sold in the US.\n\nThe new Teana, built by Dongfeng Nissan, puts a big emphasis on tech and interior quality. It looks a class above what you’d expect from an Altima-based sedan. Part of that comes from a glowing AI speaker on the dash, but the real surprise is the material choice. Nissan worked with Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (MCC) to use Durabio, a plant-based plastic that looks and feels closer to crystal than the usual trim.\n\nIn China, buyers care about big screens, lighting, and how upscale a car feels. The Teana’s interior is built to make a strong first impression, and it stands out even more when you see it lit up at night.\n\nDurabio is more than just a marketing fluff. MCC developed it as a bio-based plastic using plant-derived isosorbide. It’s clearer and handles light better than regular polycarbonate, which helps create lighting that looks deep and high-end instead of cheap or artificial.\n\nOn the Teana, Durabio is used for the inverted-pyramid AI speaker that lights up with six pillars glowing in up to 256 colors. The material refracts light cleanly, giving it a crystal-like look without needing a clear coat. That saves manufacturing steps, lowers environmental footprint, and still meets automotive durability standards.\n\nTeana runs a Huawei-based operating system to go with Durabio. The end result is an interior that feels modern and thoughtfully put together (at least visually), not just a quick update.\n\nMeanwhile, the US-market Altima heads into 2026 with almost no changes from last year. It remains affordable and practical, but next to the Teana, it comes across as very restrained. Nissan still sells a lot of sedans in the US, with over 255,000 units last year (out of the brand's over 760,000-unit sales), but the Altima’s own sales dropped to 93,268 in 2025, down 18 percent from the year before.\n\nThat drop probably comes from the Altima’s age. The current model dates back to 2018, with its last big update in 2022. It no longer stands out for design or interior appeal. After seeing what Nissan has done with the Teana, it’s fair to ask (hope, even) if a more upscale, more distinctive Altima could bring buyers back to the midsize sedan segment.\n\nFor now, there’s no clear answer. But with China getting the more ambitious upgrades, it’s easy to see how a bit of that Durabio-inspired thinking could only help the Altima.\n\nView the 9 images of this gallery on the original article",

    "fullText": "A fight broke out at Knott’s Berry Farm in Orange County Saturday night after a guest allegedly tried to cut the line and was stopped by a worker, according to a witness who recorded the incident.\n\nVideo obtained by KTLA shows two guests and a security guard involved in an altercation near an outdoor entrance area at the park as a crowd watches and cheers from behind metal barricades. Several bystanders can be seen recording the scene on their phones.\n\nOne witness said the incident happened Saturday, Jan. 17, when a guest attempted to cut the line and was denied by a worker. Officials have not confirmed this information as of Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe witness said the situation escalated, and the same guest later swung at a security guard, causing the guard to suffer a nosebleed.\n\nFootage from the scene appeared to capture moments after the confrontation began. Two guests are seen — one seems to be attempting to mediate between another guest and the security guard with the nosebleed. The other guest manages to get around and hit the security guard, but is then immediately taken to the ground by the guard while the nearby line of people start to cheer.\n\nWhile the guard restrains the woman on the pavement and directs her to put her hands behind her back, another guard is seen standing nearby, monitoring the altercation and maintaining control of the area.\n\n“Knott’s staff did an excellent job in deescalting the situation, and made it less traumatic then it was even if her nose was bleeding and she was getting assaulted by the lady she did not use pepper spray or violence, she quickly got her on the floor,” said the witness.\n\nThe clip ends with the individual still on the ground as security remains on scene. The witness said that after the video concluded, law enforcement arrived on scene and handcuffed both guests who were seen in the video.\n\nIn a statement provided to KTLA, Knott’s Berry Farm said it is “committed to providing a safe and orderly environment for all guests and does not tolerate inappropriate behavior.” The park said all visitors are required to follow its Code of Conduct to maintain a family-friendly environment, and confirmed that Buena Park Police Department arrested two guests Saturday night for violating that policy.\n\nThe guests were removed from an attraction for allegedly jumping the line before the situation escalated into a physical confrontation involving a park employee and a security officer. Both guests were arrested and removed from the park, officials said.",

    "fullText": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says President Donald Trump is serious about annexing Greenland.\n\nTrump amped up the rhetoric on Saturday, announcing on Truth Social that the United States would impose new tariffs on Denmark, which controls Greenland, and other European countries unless they hand Greenland over.\n\nSpeaking to Kristen Welker on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Bessent said Trump's push to take over Greenland was not an empty land grab but a strategy to prevent future conflict.\n\n\"The national emergency is avoiding a national emergency,\" Bessent said. \"It is a strategic decision by the president. This is a geopolitical decision, and he's able to use the economic might of the US to avoid a hot war, so why wouldn't we do that?\"\n\nGreenland is strategically located in the Arctic, acting as a buffer between North America and Russia. It is also home to minerals important to the manufacturing of future technologies.\n\nTrump has recently said that at least part of his reasoning for wanting to annex Greenland is so it can house his Golden Dome missile defense project.\n\n\"The president is trying to avoid a conflict,\" Bessent said.\n\nThat project remains in early planning stages, however, and Denmark has never said it wouldn't allow Golden Dome infrastructure on its territory. The United States already has a military base in Greenland.\n\nThe spectre that the United States — recently emboldened by its surprise raid on Venezuela that netted its leader, Nicolás Maduro, allowing it to move to open the country's oil industry — could force Europe's hand by targeting its economy or even take Greenland by force, has rankled US allies across the Atlantic.\n\nEuropean Union leaders held an emergency meeting on Sunday, during which they called Trump's tariff threat economic blackmail.\n\n\"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,\" the eight EU nations targeted by Trump said in a joint statement released on Sunday.",

The next year, I stepped into my boss's role, leading the creative team I'd almost left behind.\n\nThat experience made me realize that time off doesn't have to derail a career — it can redefine it.\n\nI wasn't a student with few obligations or a 20-something who hadn't settled on a career path. I was an established professional stepping away when the stakes were high.\n\nExtended time off can carry long-term costs — lower earnings, disrupted savings, slower compounding — but for some, the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nDavid Burkus, an organizational psychologist and author, began researching sabbaticals in 2015.\n\n\"People report better mental and physical health, increased confidence, and a greater sense of purpose after an extended break,\" Burkus told Business Insider.\n\nHe also notes the benefits for employers: Teams cross-train, share knowledge, and become less dependent on a few \"indispensable\" people.\n\nPaid sabbaticals are still a rarity in the US. Society for Human Resource Management data showed that 5% of companies offered them in 2019, rising to 7% by 2023.\n\nAnd despite employers not rolling them out broadly, employees are increasingly seeking time off. In SHRM's 2025 benefits survey, leave was the second-highest priority for workers — trailing only health benefits — for the fourth year in a row.\n\nA peer-reviewed study published in the Academy of Management in 2022 interviewed 50 professionals who had taken extended time off. All interviewees said they came back as better leaders.\n\nDJ DiDonna, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School and coauthor of the study, says everyone he interviewed wished they had taken one earlier.\n\nDiDonna told Business Insider that the best times for a sabbatical often coincide with natural life transitions, like a honeymoon, a newly empty nest, or the \"twilight career\" stage before retirement.\n\nThis collection brings together people who took that pause at different ages, for different reasons, and for vastly different lengths of time.\n\nIf you've taken an adult gap year yourself, I'd love to hear from you at akarplus@businessinsider.com.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican lawmakers are scrambling to contain President Donald Trump's threats of taking possession of Greenland, with some showing the most strident opposition to almost anything the Trump administration has done since taking office.\n\nThey gave floor speeches on the importance of NATO last week. They introduced bills meant to prevent the U.S. from attacking Denmark. And several traveled to Copenhagen to meet with Danish counterparts.\n\nBut it's not clear that will be enough, as the president continues to insist that he will take control of the Arctic island. It's raised fears of an end to NATO — a decades-old alliance that has been a pillar of American strength in Europe and around the globe — and raised questions on Capitol Hill and around the world about what Trump's aggressive, go-it-alone foreign policy will mean for world order.\n\n“When the most powerful military nation on earth threatens your territory through its president over and over and over again, you start to take it seriously,” Sen. Chris Coons told The Associated Press.\n\nThe Delaware Democrat organized the bipartisan trip to Denmark to “bring the temperature down a bit,” he said, as well as further talks about mutual military agreements in the Arctic. Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska accompanied a handful of Democrats on the trip. Also, Republican lawmakers joined in meetings in Washington last week with the Danish foreign minister and his Greenlandic counterpart where they discussed security agreements.\n\nYet it's clear Trump has other ideas. He said Saturday he will charge a 10% import tax starting in February on goods from eight European nations because of their opposition to his Greenland plans.\n\nTrump said on social media that because of modern weapons systems “the need to ACQUIRE is especially important.”\n\nThe pushback to Trump's Greenland plans\n\nKey Republicans have made clear they think that forcefully taking Greenland is out of the question. But so far, they've avoided directly rebuking Trump for his talk of possessing the island.\n\nTillis on social media called Trumps tariff plans “bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America’s allies.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters Thursday that “there’s certainly not an appetite here for some of the options that have been talked about or considered.”\n\nIn a floor speech, Thune's predecessor as Republican leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell, warned that an attempt to seize Greenland would “shatter the trust of allies\" and tarnish Trump's legacy with a disastrous foreign policy decision.\n\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers alike see an obvious path to bolstering American interests in Greenland while keeping the relationship with NATO-ally Denmark intact.\n\nIn a meeting with lawmakers Thursday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt discussed how the countries could work together to develop critical mineral industries and military cooperation, Coons said. The diplomats also told the senators there is no evidence of Chinese or Russian activity in Greenland.\n\nTrump has made the argument that the U.S. should take Greenland before China or Russia do, prompting worry across Europe. Troops from several nations have been sent to Greenland in support of Denmark.\n\nMurkowski said on social media that “our NATO allies are being forced to divert attention and resources to Greenland, a dynamic that plays directly into Putin’s hands by threatening the stability of the strongest coalition of democracies the world has ever seen.”\n\nLawmakers are looking at a few options for taking a military attack on Greenland off the table. Still, the Trump administration has shown little if any willingness to get congressional approval before taking military action.\n\nLawmakers, including Republicans like Murkowski, are pushing legislation that would prohibit Department of Defense funds from being used to attack or occupy territory that belongs to other NATO members without their consent.\n\nThe Alaska senator also suggested Congress could act to nullify Trump's tariffs. Murkowski and several other Republicans have already helped pass resolutions last year meant to undo tariffs around the globe, but those pieces of legislation did not gain traction in the House. They would have also required Trump's signature or support from two-thirds of both chambers to override his veto.\n\nDemocrats have also found some traction with war powers resolutions meant to force the president to get congressional approval before engaging in hostilities. Republicans last week narrowly defeated one such resolution that would prohibit Trump from attacking Venezuela again, and Democrats think there could potentially be more Republicans who would support one applying to Greenland.\n\n“What I’ve noticed is these war powers resolutions, they do put some pressure on Republicans,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who has forced votes on several similar resolutions. He said the tactic has also compelled the Trump administration to provide lawmakers with briefings and commitments to get congressional approval before deploying troops.\n\nStill, while dismissing the Venezuela war powers resolution on Wednesday, Republican leaders made the argument that the legislation should be ruled out of order because the Trump administration has said there are currently no U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela.\n\nThat argument may set a precedent for future war powers resolutions, giving Republicans a way to avoid voting against Trump's wishes.\n\n“If you don't have boots on the ground, it's a moot point,” said Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, about war powers resolutions in general. He also argued that the prospect of taking Greenland over the objections of Denmark is nothing \"more than a hypothetical.”\n\nOther Republicans have expressed support for Trump's insistence that the U.S. possess Greenland, though they have downplayed the idea that the U.S. would take it by force.\n\nThat's left the strongest objections on the Republican side of the aisle coming from a handful of lawmakers who are leaving Congress next year.\n\nRep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told The Omaha World Herald that an invasion of Greenland would lead to Trump's impeachment — something he would “lean” towards supporting.\n\nTillis, another retiring Republican, has directed his criticism at Trump advisors like White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller.\n\n“The fact that a small handful of ‘advisors’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Jan 18 (Reuters) - Syrian troops fighting U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces seized the Omar oil field, the country’s largest, and the Conoco gas field in the eastern Deir Zor province as allied Arab tribal forces advanced ​in the oil-rich area along the border with Iraq, officials and security sources said on Sunday.\n\nThe takeover ‌of the oil fields that lie east of the Euphrates River — a main source of revenue for the Kurdish-led forces — was a major blow to ‌the group.\n\nSyrian government officials said the oil wealth the militia had controlled to sustain its self-administered region had deprived the state of much‑needed resources.\n\nSyrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa said last week it was unacceptable for a militia to control a quarter of the country and hold its main oil and commodities resources.\n\nThe Syrian army pressed ahead into predominantly Arab-populated areas of northeast Syria controlled ⁠by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), despite ‌U.S. calls to halt its advance.\n\nA government source said Kurdish-led forces were overcome after advances led by the Arab tribal fighters, allowing the government and its tribal allies to move into ‍a stretch of territory of more than 150 km along the eastern bank of the Euphrates stretching from Baghouz near the Iraqi border towards key towns, including al-Shuhail and Busayra.\n\nSyrian government officials said the advances effectively brought most of Deir al-Zor province — the country’s main ​oil- and wheat-producing area along the Euphrates — under their control.\n\nLate on Saturday, the army also took control of the ‌northern city of Tabqa and its adjacent dam, as well as the major Freedom Dam, formerly known as the Baath Dam, west of Raqqa.\n\nSyrian Kurdish authorities have not acknowledged the loss of those strategic sites and said fighting continued near the dam area, accusing Damascus of breaching an agreement on the withdrawal of forces from areas east of Aleppo to expand its offensive.\n\nSyrian Kurdish officials said factions aligned with the government were attacking their forces despite efforts to reach a peaceful ⁠outcome. The civil administration that runs the region said Damascus was intent ​on sowing divisions between Arabs and Kurds.\n\n“We are at a critical ​juncture. We either resist or live in dignity and face all types of injustice,” their statement said, urging residents of the majority-Arab areas to stand by the SDF.\n\n“We call on our people, especially ‍the youth, to take up arms ⁠and prepare to resist any attack. We are facing a war for our survival,” it added.\n\nThe government had called on SDF fighters — most of whom are from Arab tribes — to defect. It says hundreds have already ⁠switched sides and joined tribal forces fighting the SDF.\n\nDozens of Arab tribal leaders have said they had been marginalised under Kurdish leadership, a claim ‌the SDF denies, saying its ranks reflect the diversity of Syrian society.",

    "description": "Of all the explanations for Donald Trump’s attempt to seize Greenland, the most superficially attractive is that the President has dementia. In which case, why not just pretend to give it to him? Fly him to somewhere that looks green, throw a military parade, and tell him that’s it. Senile fantasy fulfilled.",
    "fullText": "Of all the explanations for Donald Trump’s attempt to seize Greenland, the most superficially attractive is that the President has dementia. In which case, why not just pretend to give it to him? Fly him to somewhere that looks green, throw a military parade, and tell him that’s it. Senile fantasy fulfilled.\n\nAlas, the rot goes so much deeper. Trump is not mad, he’s doing what America always does, just crassly and out in the open. This became clearer this week when I chanced upon a copy of Lament for a Nation by the Canadian philosopher George Grant, published in 1965.\n\nGrant wrote at a turning point in his country’s history. In 1957, Canada had elected a conservative PM called John Diefenbaker who was not unlike Nigel Farage or, indeed, Trump: populist, nationalist, deeply anti-Left. But when the Americans asked to put their nuclear weapons on his soil, Diefenbaker – to my surprise – said no.\n\nHe believed he had a right to do this because Nato is, on paper, an alliance of equals – and a necessity because once Canada became a missile base, all pretence of an independent foreign policy would end.\n\nThe business and cultural elite turned on Diefenbaker and the public kicked him out of office.\n\nAmerica, basking in the glow of Jack Kennedy, was then admired as the embodiment of modernity: nationalism seemed antiquated and eccentric. Thus, argued Grant, Canada’s nuclear surrender represented the final stage in a process of economic and cultural assimilation. A society so integrated into the American Way lacked not just the resources but, crucially, the imagination to stand on its own two feet.\n\nSo it goes with contemporary Europe, where American corporations dominate and profit, yet also avoid paying a lot of tax. Ireland, for example, has rightly denounced Trump’s tariff war on the nations that oppose his aggressive takeover of Greenland – yet the country is a model of globalist acquiescence at the cost of sovereignty. It has embraced free markets (low corporate taxes) and free movement (mass migration), with the result that Dublin is outwardly Irish – still beautiful – yet unaffordable and embroiled in a violent identity crisis.\n\nThese are economic policies that its elites justify as essential to modern nation building (“we need money, we need workers”), and it’s striking that the SNP has proposed doing similar things should Scotland gain independence. As Grant observed in 1965, the modern nation state can only develop by opening its arms to global capitalism, but global capitalism “entails the disappearance of those indigenous differences that give substance to nationalism.”\n\nIn short, American capital has made all of us rich, but it has also made us duplicates of the US. I’m convinced that many Britons are desperately unhappy, even mentally ill, because they don’t feel like themselves anymore.\n\nIt’s obvious in the way we now talk (badly) and emote (too often) but most apparent in our politics, which is imported and detached from our real history. Identity politics was Made in America: when federal agents shot and killed a protestor in Minnesota (murder in my book), Labour mayors felt obliged to write a letter of support for the Democrat mayor of Minneapolis. Why?\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, James Cleverly says his hero is Ronald Reagan, the Tories sell the good life in terms of Reaganite aspiration, and the infamous Jenrick memo, written to plot his defection to Reform, described him as the “new sheriff in town”. Its author spelt favourite without a “u”.\n\nThe party Rob joins has painted itself into a corner, having gambled its credentials on access to Trump and now forced to pretend there’s distance. Lo, even Brexit has been colonised. Outside of the European Union, said its Right-wing think-tankers, the only hope is a deal with America, a logic that even Keir Starmer has swallowed, pursuing regulatory alignment on the future of AI.\n\nOne suspects that for all Labour’s hatred of Elon Musk, it will never ban Twitter, because Trump will almost certainly apply sanctions.\n\nWe should not think of the President as un-American, as some embarrassed Americans call him, but the most American president ever, which is to say the ultimate liberal.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans, even if they disagree on practical policies, are both drawn from the philosophical tradition of liberalism, rooted in love of individual freedom, the unleashing of personal passion. Trump wants something, so he makes it happen. That’s what liberalism means, and it has infected us, too.\n\nIt’s why in the UK marriage and birth are out of style, pews are empty, and our top-rated TV show involves traitors killing faithfuls for cash (“she’s playing a blinder,” they say, as if human relations are a competitive sport).\n\nIf Britain is broken – and a country where the latest figures show 299,614 abortions a year, 40 for a cleft lip or palate, is definitely broken – it is because millions have chosen to maximise their freedom and wealth at the cost of social solidarity.\n\nThe Old Canada of John Diefenbaker, claimed Grant, was different because it combined the Tory paternalism of England with the ethics of French Catholicism, which said “virtue must be prior to freedom.” But these are gone, and Grant concluded that their demise was unavoidable because no nation can resist the power of America or the temptation of individualism.\n\nLiberalism ends, if not quite in world government, then in the whole world looking the same. What do the Japanese eat on Christmas Day? KFC.\n\nThis is why I watch the trade war for Greenland with distress and, I’m afraid, pessimism. Yes, Trump must be resisted. It is a question of dignity.\n\nBut until we Europeans wean ourselves off America, not just militarily or economically but psychologically, we really cannot function without it and will always surrender. It has dominated us for a long time; we’ve only noticed since the empire that pushed out investment suddenly started to suck it back in, a phenomenon that, again, is not unique to Trump. Joe Biden used subsidies and tax breaks to re-shore jobs in the US, away from the continent.\n\nThe irony is that alternative, more benign American political traditions do exist, but they’ve always been dismissed by Europeans as naive or dangerous because they wouldn’t bankroll our defence: libertarian among the Republicans, socialist among the Democrats. If only we’d had president Ron Paul or president Bernie Sanders. Greenland would go unmolested.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Chelsea have held talks to sign Rennes centre-back Jeremy Jacquet during the winter transfer window.\n\nThe Blues have spoken to both Rennes and the 20-year-old's agent over a January move but are currently being quoted more than £60m to secure a deal this month.\n\nThe France Under-21 international is known to be interested in the move although BBC Sport understands there is substantial rival interest.\n\nThe talks follow an internal decision at Stamford Bridge to bring forward plans to sign a centre-back by six months, instead of waiting until the summer.\n\nAlternative options will also be considered. There is reported interest in Como defender Jacabo Ramon – who is also attracting attention from Real Madrid – and Bournemouth's Marcos Senesi.\n\nSenesi, whose contract expires at the end of the season, is also a Juventus target, while the south-coast club have yet to receive any formal contact from Chelsea.\n\nChelsea had previously explored signing a centre-back for former manager Enzo Maresca last summer, but key target Dean Huijsen opted to join Real Madrid.\n\nOther options were assessed but Chelsea did not believe they could find a suitable alternative, contributing to one of Maresca's early frustrations that eventually played a part in his mid-season departure.\n\nThe desire to sign a ball-playing centre-back came after Levi Colwill sustained a serious knee injury in pre-season, although his recovery is progressing well and there is optimism he will feature later in the campaign. He remains central to Chelsea's long-term plans.\n\nThere is also growing expectation that both Trevoh Chalobah and Tosin Adarabioyo will reach a crossroads in the summer, when they will have two years remaining on their contracts and either sign new deals or face the possibility of being sold.",

Everything is in place for a triumphant surge towards the finishing tape.\n\nBack-to-back goalless draws has left some questioning Arsenal's firepower but, with the tightest defence in the league and their rivals continually slipping up, it would take a brave person to back against them now.\n\nBigger leads have been lost at the top of the Premier League before - and later in the season - but none of the teams below them are showing signs of producing the consistency needed to challenge them.\n\nManchester City failed to turn up the pressure valve before Arsenal travelled to the City Ground by losing the derby at Manchester United - a fourth straight match without a win.\n\nAnd then, here at Villa Park, Aston Villa saw their hopes of leap-frogging Pep Guardiola's side into second place undone as excellent Everton secured a fully deserved win.\n\nAs for reigning champions Liverpool, they have mounted a miserable defence of their crown, Saturday's disappointing draw against Burnley at Anfield that provoked jeers from their fans leaving them fourth, a distant 14 points behind Arsenal.\n\nVilla had won their previous 11 games at home, but Everton threatened the decisive moments long before Thierno Barry cashed in on keeper Emi Martinez's decision to turn a routine stop into an item for his showreel with a classy finish.",
