    "description": "Who will win Tuesday's matchup between the 18th-ranked Clemson Tigers and Will Wade's NC State Wolfpack? Here's ESPN's prediction.",
    "fullText": "The Clemson Tigers host the NC State Wolfpack in midweek play Tuesday to start the fourth week of ACC basketball play.\n\nClemson (16-3 overall) finds itself unbeaten and 6-0 in conference play after taking down a streaking Miami Hurricanes team that had won 10 straight games before Saturday. In the Tigers' 69-59 win over the 'Canes, Clemson jumped out to an 8-0 lead in the opening minutes and never trailed.\n\nCarter Welling had a career-high 18 points, Jestin Porter added 11, and RJ Godfrey had 10 points as Clemson won its ninth straight overall since its last-second loss to BYU at the Jimmy V Classic at Madison Square Garden on Dec. 9. The Tigers also ended a 10-game Miami winning streak.\n\nNC State (12-6, 3-2) carries no such streak into Tuesday's game. The Wolfpack are coming off a 78-74 upset loss to Georgia Tech on Saturday in Raleigh despite 16 points from Quadir Copeland. Senior forward Darrion Williams leads NC State in scoring this season with 14.2 points per game.\n\nTV announcers, start time for Clemson basketball vs NC State Wolfpack https://t.co/Ufn6beaHyR pic.twitter.com/D56TubDJAz\n\n— Clemson Wire (@Clemson_Wire) January 19, 2026\n\nESPN's matchup predictor, which offers a prediction model based on its college basketball power index (BPI) and other variables, gives Clemson a 67.5% chance to win and NC State a 32.5% chance.\n\nThe Tigers are 23rd nationally in ESPN's latest BPI ratings, up one spot from last week. Clemson has a 15.9 overall rating. The metrics give the Tigers an 6.4 rating on offense that ranks 49th nationally, and a 9.4 rating on defense that's 16th nationally.\n\nNC State is 28th nationally in BPI. The Wolfpack have an 8.3 rating on offense that ranks also 28th nationally and a 6.5 rating on defense that's 38th.\n\nRounded up, ESPN's BPI ratings give Clemson an overall final record projection of 24-7, the same as last week. That includes a 14-4 mark in ACC play. The Tigers' remaining strength of schedule rates 74th nationally.\n\nClemson is currently given a 14.6% chance of winning the ACC title, which is down slightly from 15% before the Tigers' win over Miami.\n\nThe Duke Blue Devils lead ESPN's BPI with a 24.3 rating (12.3 offense, 12.0 defense). Among ACC teams, Clemson is ranked fourth in BPI, one spot behind Virginia.\n\nHere's a full look at all 18 teams ranked by ESPN's basketball power index.\n\n18.

BPI represents how many points above or below average a team is. Strength of Record (SOR) is a measure of team accomplishment based on how difficult a team's W-L record is to achieve. Game predictions account for opponent strength, pace of play, site, travel distance, day's rest and altitude, and are used to simulate the season 10,000 times to produce season projections.

    "fullText": "Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes continues to rehab after surgery on his knee. He spoke with reporters recently, discussing the importance of his relationship with Assistant Athletic Trainer Julie Frymyer when dealing with the injury.\n\n“I think it’s extremely important because what I’ve found out throughout this process is not every day is going to feel amazing,” said Mahomes, “There’s some days you’re going to be sore or some days you’re going to feel stiff, but you have to have someone you trust that’s going to get the best out of you, that’s going to keep you safeand someone that’s going to push you more than anything. Some days I want to go in there and crush rehab (and) some days I just want to get through it, but she (Assistant Athletic Trainer Julie Frymyer) doesn’t let you have the get through it days.”\n\nMahomes has shown trust in Frymyer off the field, as she co-starred with him in a recent State Farm commercial alongside singer Meghan Trainor.\n\n“She pushes you to be the best every single day. It’s been a different process, kind of jumping right into working out like this,” said Mahomes, “I always worked out, built up throughout the offseason, but it’s been fun to be with people that care about me, and that want to push me to be the best that I can be. I’m in that training room every single day, and I’m trying to make sure that I’m ready to go as quickly as possible.”\n\nKansas City’s medical staff will be hard at work this offseason to get the franchise quarterback up and running ahead of the 2025 season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chiefs Wire: Patrick Mahomes discusses strong trust in the Chiefs’ training staff",

    "fullText": "Fulham are battling Wolfsburg and Real Betis in the race to sign Troy Parrott following his huge impact in the Republic of Ireland’s quest to qualify for the World Cup 2026.\n\nSo far, the trio are the clubs that have gone in strongest in what is expected to be a wide race for the AZ Alkmaar forward over the next few months.\n\nThe 23-year-old's profile exploded after the five goals against Portugal and Hungary that sent Heimir Hallgrimsson’s side into a World Cup play-off.\n\nBut that was only on the back of burgeoning development that had made a series of clubs around the Premier League and European football take note of his impact in the Netherlands.\n\nWolfsburg have talked about a €20m (£17.4m) deal, but it is understood that AZ would want even more. Fulham have so far shown the strongest interest from the Premier League.\n\nHaving energised his career at AZ, though, Parrott is understood to want to be very considerate about his next steps. While the forward does want to return to the Premier League at some point - he initially came through the Tottenham Hotspur system - any English move would have to fully make sense for both his current position and future prospects, which is why he is happy to stay in Europe.\n\nThe Bundesliga is an appealing option, particularly with the way the competition has proven so successful in developing young talent.\n\nAway from his prolific run for his country, Parrott has hit nine goals in 13 Eredivisie games, with 10 more goals this term in Conference League qualifiers and the KNVB Cup.\n\nParrott is tied fourth in the Eredivisie top scorer standings, with Ayase Ueda clear with 18 goals in as many games for Feyenoord.",

    "fullText": "Records are meant to be broken, and the Texas A&M Aggies wasted no time proving it at the Corky Classic in Lubbock. Several members of the Aggie Track & Field program made history over the weekend, setting the tone for what could be a special indoor campaign.\n\nTexas A&M opened the season with force, stacking up 39 top‑ten finishes, 19 medalists, and multiple athletes climbing the program’s all‑time performer lists.\n\nThe first breakthrough came from senior thrower Henry Zimmerman, who delivered a school‑record performance in the weight throw. His final attempt—21.88m (71‑9.5)—secured second overall and made him the top collegiate finisher in the field.\n\nFreshman pole vaulter Lily Carlson followed with a statement of her own. Competing in just her second collegiate meet, Carlson cleared 4.41m (14‑5.5) to break the Texas A&M indoor record previously held by All‑American Heather Abadie. She claimed gold with a dominant seven‑inch margin over the next closest competitor.\n\nThe record‑setting weekend wrapped on the final day when freshman distance runner Peter Narumbe delivered one of the fastest 1,000m races in NCAA history. His time of 2:19.88 not only broke Luca Santorum’s school record—it also stands as the 17th‑fastest 1,000m ever recorded at the collegiate level. His gold‑medal finish ranks him third all‑time among NCAA freshmen.\n\nWhile Texas A&M is traditionally known for its outdoor prowess, this year’s squad has the depth and talent to be a real factor indoors and in the SEC race. The Aggies return to action on January 25, hosting the Ted Nelson Invitational at the Fasken Indoor Track & Field facility.\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes, and opinions.

    "description": "Penn State could have a bounce-back season in 2026 and may be on the College Football Playoff bubble according to this early ranking from On3.",
    "fullText": "With the book officially closed on the 2025 college football season and a new national champion having been crowned, it is now time to shift our focus to the 2026 college football season. It's never too early for that, right? As is typically the case when the season comes to a close, the tradition of way-too-early top-25 projections are making the rounds already, and one of the more interesting teams to scout on these lists will be Penn State.\n\nFollowing a program-changing 2025 season with an in-season coaching change and the hiring of Matt Campbell to steer the ship back on course, and with a massive offseason roster overhaul as a result, Penn State may be a difficult team for many to accurately project in the 2026 season. But that will not stop anyone from attempting to gauge where the Nittany Lions will be sitting next season. If one way-too-early top-25 list from On3 is any indication, Penn State could be on the College Football Playoff bubble next fall.\n\nOn3 released its way-too-early top-25 list and gave Penn State a No. 14 projection. Putting Penn State somewhere in the middle of any top-25 projection feels somewhat fair given the changes wiht the program and puts some trust in Campbell to turn things around from Penn State's 2025 season. It also feels like a pretty safe projection to suggest Penn State could be in the playoff hunt but may fall just outside of it.\n\nOhio State tops the On3 top-25 outlook, followed by Georgia, Texas, and Notre Dame, respectively. 2025 national champion Indiana takes the No. 5 slot in the On3 way-too-early top-25, with Oregon right behind the Hoosiers to give the Big Ten three top-10 teams in this projection. Michigan is the only other Big Ten team ranked ahead of Penn State, at No. 11.\n\nOther Big Ten teams ranked in On3's early projection are Washington (No. 18), USC (No. 19), and Iowa (No. 21). Penn State will play road games next season at Michigan and Washington and will host USC. The Nittany Lions will not face Ohio State, Indiana, or Oregon during the regular season in 2026. Also of note, On3 also ranks Virginia Tech, now coached by former Penn State head coach James Franklin, at No. 23.\n\nFollow Kevin McGuire on Threads, Bluesky, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.\n\nFollow Nittany Lions Wire on X, Facebook, and Threads.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Nittany Lions Wire: Where Penn State ranks in On3's way-too-early top 25 for 2026 season",

    "fullText": "Athletic Club has officially announced the squad list for the crucial Champions League match against Atalanta in Bergamo.\n\nAfter a final training session marked by uncertainty, Ernesto Valverde has put together a group of 23 players, shaped by significant absences, especially in the attack and on the flanks.\n\nThe main negative news is confirmed by the absence of key players such as Iñaki Williams, Nico Williams, Berenguer, and Yuri Berchiche. These four footballers, fundamental pillars in the offensive and defensive schemes of the \"lions,\" are not included in the final list to travel to Italy.\n\nAymeric Laporte is also missing from the squad, a loss that weakens the heart of the defense. These absences will force the team to reinvent itself in a high-stakes European setting where effectiveness will be crucial.\n\nOn the positive side, the squad list includes the return of Mikel Vesga and the presence of Nico Serrano, who has ultimately been included in the coach’s plans despite initial doubts.\n\nAdditionally, the inclusion of Andoni Gorosabel stands out, as he strengthens the right flank in a list where the experience of players like Unai Simón, Lekue, or Galarreta will be vital to guide the younger players in the hostile environment of Bergamo.\n\nFaced with a wave of injuries, Valverde has firmly backed the talent from Lezama. The squad features a strong representation of youngsters and players registered with the reserve team such as Padilla, Santos, Jon de Luis, Rego, Ibon Sánchez, Selton, Hierro, and Adrián Pérez.\n\nThis commitment to the youth academy is not just a necessity, but also an opportunity for the jewels of the red-and-white structure to make their debut or establish themselves in the top continental competition against one of Serie A’s most tactical opponents.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "Robert Saleh’s impending tenure as Tennessee Titans head coach comes with an unusual wrinkle for the franchise: He plans to call defensive plays himself, a responsibility he did not carry as head coach of the New York Jets.\n\nNew #Titans HC Robert Saleh indicated to teams in interviews that he plans to call defensive plays in his next stop as HC, per sources. \n\nThat wasn’t the case in his #Jets tenure. https://t.co/9hjhYCjkh7 pic.twitter.com/TtdMqrn1AA\n\n— Jordan Schultz (@Schultz_Report) January 20, 2026\n\nSaleh’s decision to take on defensive play-calling signals that he wants more direct control of the side of the ball that has defined his career. As San Francisco’s defensive coordinator, Saleh built a reputation as a top defensive mind, and Tennessee clearly hopes to lean on that expertise to upgrade a defense that struggled with consistency last season.\n\nBut Saleh’s choice also raises the stakes on his offensive coordinator hire.\n\nWith Saleh focused on defense, Tennessee must land a top-tier offensive play-caller -- not only to manage game strategy but to help develop rookie quarterback Cam Ward, the 2025 No. 1 overall pick.\n\nWard showed promise as a rookie, but his continued growth likely hinges on having an OC who can design and call an effective offense. Saleh’s expanded role gives him control where he’s strongest, but success in Nashville will depend on pairing that with elite offensive leadership.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Titans Wire: Robert Saleh plans to call defensive plays with Tennessee Titans",

    "fullText": "Great Britain's Katie Boulter exited the Australian Open after being outclassed by Belinda Bencic in a straight-set first-round loss in Melbourne.\n\nBoulter, the world number 113 after an inconsistent 2025, was a last-minute entry into the main draw following a withdrawal - which spared her from having to compete in qualifying.\n\nHanded a tough opening match, she could not initially compete with Swiss 10th seed Bencic and conceded the first set in just 26 minutes, without winning a game.\n\nBoulter offered much sterner resistance in set two, breaking her opponent's serve for the first time to level at 4-4, but she could not force a decider.\n\nBencic, a two-time major semi-finalist, completed a 6-0 7-5 win and will meet Australia's Daria Kasatkina or Czech teenager Nikola Bartunkova next.\n\nSpeaking after her loss, Boulter said she was looking forward to trying to rediscover some form and would contest lower-level tournaments on the WTA Tour to do so.\n\n\"Ultimately last year was very bitty, so I never really found I got that rhythm of match play,\" Boulter said.\n\n\"I'm very excited to go and play some tournaments, even lower ones. I think it will be great for me to do.\"\n\nHow popularity overwhelmed Eala - and the Australian Open\n\n'Timid' Keys overcomes nerves to start title defence\n\nBoulter endured a difficult 2025, dropping from 24th in the world to outside the top 100, and lost her British number one ranking amid injury struggles.\n\nSeeking a fresh start this season, the Briton ended her partnership with long-term coach Biljana Veselinovic and is now being assisted by American Michael Joyce, who helped Maria Sharapova win two Grand Slams and reach world number one.\n\nIt is also a significant year for Boulter away from the court, with her wedding to Australian tennis star Alex de Minaur planned for later in 2026.\n\nSpeaking before the tournament, Boulter said: \"I'm getting married this year. It's going to be an unbelievable year, one of the best ones in my life, no matter what happens on the tennis court.\n\n\"I think for me that's already given me a positive push.\"\n\nShe added: \"I feel like having a new coach, having a new set-up, everything is fresh and exciting again. Whereas I feel like I was dragging my feet a little bit at the end of last year just trying to get through the whole entire year without injuries.\"\n\nNow British number four, Boulter has won only four tour-level matches since Wimbledon.\n\nShe tore an abductor in her final event of last year in Hong Kong and returned to action at the ASB Classic in Auckland earlier this month, losing in the second round.\n\nFather-to-be Ruud ready to leave Melbourne early\n\nVictorious Sinner sees 'room to improve' on serve",

    "description": "Here is more on why the Bills chose to fire Sean McDermott, but retained GM Brandon Beane.",
    "fullText": "Why was Brandon Beane promoted? Inside Bills GM's history of poor draft picks, free-agent signings since Josh Allen originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOn Monday, the Buffalo Bills decided to fire head coach Sean McDermott — but not general manager Brandon Beane.\n\nThe move came as the Bills once again came up short in the postseason. There were controversial calls, but nonetheless, Buffalo lost to the Denver Broncos in overtime of their divisional round matchup. The loss moved McDermott to 8-8 in the postseason and marked another year he didn't reach the Super Bowl.\n\nGiven the franchise's continued falling short of expectations, there was a chance the head coach's firing signified that Buffalo would clean house. Instead, Beane was retained. In team owner Terry Pegula's statement about McDermott's termination, it was revealed that Beane would actually be getting a slight promotion to President of Football Operations/General Manager.\n\nHere is more on why the Bills elected to retain Beane instead of firing him with McDermott.\n\nMORE: Why did the Bills fire Sean McDermott?\n\nBuffalo chose not to fire Beane with McDermott. Instead, he received his promotion.\n\nIn Pegula's statement about McDermott's firing, he cited that \"Brandon [Beane] will oversee all facets of our football operation, including the oversight of our coaching staff. I have full faith in and have witnessed Brandon's outstanding leadership style and have confidence in his abilities to lead our organization.\"\n\nThe #Bills make it official: Sean McDermott is out pic.twitter.com/1IJZrWiXh6\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) January 19, 2026\n\nMORE: What's next for Sean McDermott after Bills firing?\n\nBeane was hired as the Buffalo GM ahead of the 2017 season. Since then, he has had nine draft classes. Some of them have been full of hits like in 2018 when he drafted Josh Allen, Tremaine Edmunds, Harrison Phillips, Taron Johnson and Wyatt Teller.\n\nOther drafts, like 2021, were rough outings for Beane as half of the class ended up playing fewer than two seasons in the NFL.\n\n2 -- WR Zay Jones, East Carolina\n\n5 -- LB Matt Milano, Boston College\n\n5 -- QB Nathan Peterman, Pittsburgh\n\n6 -- LB Tanner Vallejo, Boise St.\n\n2017 is a pretty solid example of what Beane brings to the table. He hit on White, who has gone on to play 109 career games, with 98 of them coming with the Bills. Dawkins has spent all of his nine-year career with Buffalo and has developed into one of the more reliable offensive linemen in the league. Guys like Jones and Peterman spent more time in their careers away from the Bills as opposed to with them.\n\n1 -- MLB Tremaine Edmunds, Virginia Tech\n\n3 -- DT Harrison Phillips, Stanford\n\n4 -- CB Taron Johnson, Weber St.\n\n5 -- CB Siran Neal, Jacksonville St.\n\n5 -- OG Wyatt Teller, Virginia Tech\n\n6 -- WR Ray-Ray McCloud, Clemson\n\n7 -- WR Austin Proehl, North Carolina\n\nThis has been one of Beane's best draft classes. Buffalo took Allen with the No. 7 pick and he has developed into their franchise quarterback and has won an MVP Award. Edmunds spent five years with the Bills before signing with the Chicago Bears. Similarly, Phillips played out his rookie deal with the Bills and signed elsewhere in free agency. Teller played only one year in Buffalo before he was traded to the Cleveland Browns.\n\n3 -- RB Devin Singletary, Florida Atlantic\n\n7 -- DE Darryl Johnson, North Carolina A&T\n\n7 -- TE Tommy Sweeney, Boston College\n\nThis was a problematic class for Beane and the Bills. Oliver was a great start and remains with Buffalo after seven years, as does Knox. Ford was in Buffalo for three years, Singletary for four, Johnson for four (has been out of the league since), Johnson for two, Sweeney for three (has been out of the league since) and Joseph never played. Outside of Oliver and Knox, this class lacked longevity in Buffalo.\n\nMORE: Ranking the greatest Bills of all time\n\n4 -- WR Gabe Davis, Central Florida\n\n6 -- K Tyler Bass, Georgia Southern\n\n6 -- WR Isaiah Hodgins, Oregon St.\n\n7 -- CB Dane Jackson, Pittsburgh\n\nThis was a good draft class for Beane. Epenesa continues to be a solid defender for Buffalo, as does Jackson. Davis has had solid seasons, as has Bass though both have struggled recently. The big misses from this class were Moss and Fromm, who didn't last long in Buffalo.\n\n1 -- DL Gregory Rousseau, Miami\n\n2 -- DL Boogie Basham, Wake Forest\n\n3 -- OL Spencer Brown, Northern Iowa\n\n5 -- OL Tommy Doyle, Miami (OH)\n\n6 -- WR Marquez Stevenson, Houston\n\n6 -- DB Damar Hamlin, Pittsburgh\n\n6 -- CB Rachad Wildgoose, Wisconsin\n\n7 -- OL Jack Anderson, Texas Tech\n\nRousseau remains in Buffalo and has 32 career sacks, and Brown continues to be a starting member of the offensive line when healthy. Basham only lasted two seasons with the Bills, while Doyle, Stevenson, Wildgoose and Anderson have all played fewer than two seasons in the league. Hamlin has been a productive depth piece after being drafted in the sixth round.\n\n5 -- WR Khalil Shakir, Boise St.\n\n6 -- P Matt Araiza, San Diego St.\n\n6 -- DB Christian, Benford, Villanova\n\n6 -- OL Luke Tenuta, Virginia Tech\n\n7 -- LB Baylor Spector, Clemson\n\nThe 2022 draft was another solid one for Beane and Buffalo. Cook, Bernard, Benford and Shakir remain starters when healthy. Cook has developed into one of the best running backs in the NFL, and Shakir led the Bills in receiving in 2025.\n\nElam was a pretty big miss. He played in 29 games over three years and had just two interceptions before being cut ahead of the 2025 season. Araiza had off-field issues arise and never played for the Bills. He has since returned to the NFL, but is the punter for the Kansas City Chiefs. Tenuta never played with the Bills and Spector is a depth piece still on the roster.\n\nMORE: When is the last time the Bills won a Super Bowl?\n\n2 -- OL O'Cyrus Torrence, Florida\n\n3 -- LB Dorian Williams, Tulane\n\n5 -- WR Justin Shorter, Florida\n\n7 -- DB Alex Austin, Oregon St.\n\nThis was the fewest number of picks that Buffalo had in a draft in Beane's tenure. Kincaid remains the starting tight end when healthy. Torrence has started all but one game since the Bills drafted him. Williams remains a depth linebacker for the Bills, but Shorter, Broeker and Austin never played a game for Buffalo and are all on different teams if they are still in the league.\n\n2 -- WR Keon Coleman, Florida State\n\n5 -- OL Sedrick Van Pran-Granger, Georgia\n\n5 -- LB Edefuan Ulofoshio, Washington\n\n6 -- OL Tylan Grable, Central Florida\n\n6 -- CB Daequan Hardy, Penn State\n\nColeman won the hearts of Bills fans in his opening press conference, but by his second season was already being listed as a healthy scratch for disciplinary reasons. Bishop started all 17 games for the Bills in 2025, but Carter missed the entire season due to a torn Achilles tendon in the preseason.\n\nDavis is the primary backup running back for Cook. The others are mainly depth pieces, but Hardy and Clayton are no longer on the team.\n\nMORE: Inside Keon Coleman's timeline of trouble in Buffalo\n\n1 -- CB Maxwell Hairston, Kentucky\n\n2 -- DT T.J. Sanders, South Carolina\n\n3 -- DE Landon Jackson, Arkansas\n\n5 -- S Jordan Hancock, Ohio State\n\n5 -- TE Jackson Hawes, Georgia Tech\n\n6 -- CB Dorian Strong, Virginia Tech\n\n6 -- OL Chase Lundt, Connecticut\n\n7 -- WR Kaden Prather, Maryland\n\nPrather is the only member of this draft class who didn't appear in a game in their rookie season. Only Walker and Hawes saw action in all 17 games. Hairston had two interceptions and 18 tackles, while Sanders had seven tackles and a sack, with both expected to take a step forward in 2026.\n\nAllen was drafted with Buffalo's first-round pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. He was selected seventh overall and was the third quarterback drafted in the class. Baker Mayfield was chosen first by the Cleveland Browns, and the New York Jets took Sam Darnold third. Allen was the third of five quarterbacks drafted in the first round that year, along with Josh Rosen (10th) and Lamar Jackson (32nd).\n\nMORE: Inside Sean McDermott's career coaching timeline\n\nIf GMs aren't able to hit in the draft, their next option is to sign free agents. The Bills have been scrutinized recently for not paying for a dominant wide receiver for Allen to lean on in the offense, but that isn't the only miss for their recent years of free agency.\n\nBeane made a splash in the 2017 offseason bringing in a pair of safeties on huge contracts. Hyde was signed to a five-year deal worth $30.5 million, while Poyer inked a four-year, $13 million deal. They developed into a dominant safety tandem, that played together through the 2023 season when Hyde retired.\n\nMcGovern was a big signing for Buffalo as the offensive lineman was signed to a three-year, $22.35 million deal. He played in all but two games for the Bills over the course of the deal and should be a player that Beane and Buffalo want to re-sign for the 2026 season and beyond.\n\nMORE: Revisiting the Bills' four consecutive Super Bowl losses\n\nBeane and the Bills signed defensive end Von Miller to a massive six-year, $120 million deal ahead of the 2022 NFL season. The pass-rusher was 33 years old at the time, and the contract was expected to have him in Buffalo through his age 39 season. Miller had eight sacks in 11 games in 2020 before tearing his ACL. He only had six sacks over his next 25 games. Miller was released after three years.\n\nThe Bills have been unable to lock down a top-end wide receiver for Allen. To add wide receiver depth, Buffalo signed veteran wide receiver Curtis Samuel to a three-year, $24 million deal ahead of the 2024 season. Injuries have derailed his Bills tenure, but he has played in 20 games over the last two seasons and has combined for 334 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nAddison was signed to a three-year, $30.45 million deal ahead of the 2020 season. The then-33-year-old played in two seasons with Buffalo and had 59 tackles with 12 sacks. He was released after the 2021 season and signed with the Houston Texans.",

    "fullText": "French club Marseille are in talks to sign Arsenal midfielder Ethan Nwaneri on loan for the rest of the season.\n\nDiscussions about a deal are ongoing with a loan fee one of the aspects of the deal being worked on.\n\nBBC Sport previously reported that Nwaneri was not expected to go on loan this season with the original feeling from both club and player being that the 18-year-old would benefit by being part of a squad that is challenging for a title.\n\nHowever, the prospect of playing football in another league and country while getting regular game time is a scenario that is appealing to the player.\n\nThe England Under-21 international has made just 12 appearances for the Gunners in all competitions, starting four games but none in the Premier League, and has scored once this season in the Carabao Cup.\n\nNwaneri signed a new contract in the summer until 2030, but has found his route into the first team challenged by the signings of Noni Madueke for £48.5m and Eberechi Eze for £67m.\n\nNwaneri's taste of regular minutes last season has raised his expectations and having to fight for game time at a club like Arsenal has not surprised him, but with two England internationals ahead of him, regular minutes have been hard to come by.\n\nEze himself has struggled to break into the Arsenal starting XI in recent weeks and has played 23 minutes in the Gunners last six Premier League games. He has been an unused substitute in four of those matches.\n\nLast season, Nwaneri played mostly on the right wing and scored nine goals in 37 appearances in all competitions to mark himself out as one of England's most talented young players.\n\nBut with Madueke the first choice as back up to Bukayo Saka and Eze the number 10 to challenge captain Martin Odegaard, the two positions Nwaneri would fit into have become harder to get.\n\nWhat next for Nwaneri after season of frustration?\n\nArsenal are having an excellent season and are seven points clear at the top of the Premier League, have an 100% record in the Champions League and are in the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup with a lead over Chelsea from the first leg.\n\nThe Gunners are hoping to end their wait for a trophy this season and have signed a number of players including midfielder Martin Zubimendi, Eze and - despite his struggles - striker Viktor Gyokeres as \"win now\" signings.\n\nThat has meant that manager Mikel Arteta has looked at using players with experience to get results with Odegaard and Zubimendi preferred in midfield, while the Spaniard has favoured both Riccardo Calafiori and Piero Hincapie at left-back this season.\n\nHincapie has experience of winning a league title after being part of the Bayer Leverkusen side that won the Bundesliga in 2023-24.\n\nThat has made things difficult for Nwaneri's fellow academy graduate Myles Lewis-Skelly.\n\nLewis-Skelly also took his chance during Arsenal's injury crisis last season, making 42 appearances in all competitions, including playing in both games of the impressive Champions League quarter-final win over Real Madrid.\n\nLewis-Skelly's performances were so good that he was given an England debut by Thomas Tuchel, scoring against Albania in a 2-0 win and looked set to be the Three Lions' starting left-back at the World Cup.\n\nGame time hasn't been as hard to come by for Lewis-Skelly and he has started nine of his 23 appearances this season, but he has started just once in the Premier League and has dropped out of the England squad.\n\nIt is always going to be hard for young players to break through from the academy into the first team at a club like Arsenal without any dips in form.\n\nBut after two excellent breakthrough seasons for Lewis-Skelly and Nwaneri, it looks as though development path will be slightly different to what the pair imagined at the beginning of the season.",

    "fullText": "Xabi Alonso is being mentioned as a candidate for the Manchester United job following his recent dismissal from Real Madrid, which ended after just seven months in charge.\n\nRuben Amorim was let go by United after just over a year in charge. His exit came at the same time as two other high-profile departures from top European clubs, Chelsea and Real Madrid.\n\nNow out of work, Amorim is part of a growing group of available coaches. Other big names on that list include Enzo Maresca and Xabi Alonso.\n\nMaresca is well-known as a protégé of Pep Guardiola, having previously made a name for himself at Leicester City in the Championship. Alonso is another potential option, although his exit from Madrid was reportedly due to clashes with both the board and dressing room.\n\nThe wider wave of dismissals gives United more options if they want to avoid additional compensation fees.\n\nUnited fans expect Ineos to avoid penny-pinching or shortcuts when appointing a permanent head coach, especially after questionable decisions by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his chiefs since taking control of football operations at Old Trafford.\n\nAlonso is expected to look for a fresh challenge following his brief spell with Real Madrid.\n\nHis Bayer Leverkusen side ran away with the Bundesliga title in 2022–23, and even though things did not work out at Madrid, his reputation around Europe is still strong.\n\nHaving spent five years at Anfield during his playing days, some might question whether he would ever consider a move to Old Trafford. Sir Matt Busby famously made that leap in the past, but it is unclear if the Spaniard would follow that path.\n\nESPN’s Mark Ogden addressed the rumours on The Football Reporters podcast after speaking with contacts about whether United were actually interested in bringing him in.\n\n“But I just want to kind of drop something that I was told last week,” Ogden began by saying.\n\n“So when the whole Man United situation was going off and I was speaking to somebody talking about United and just a kind of a cheeky little, ‘why not consider Xabi Alonso?’\n\n“And obviously, I know the answer is that he played for Liverpool etc. But he was like, no, no, no, that’s not going to happen.\n\n“He said, and the story that this guy had been told, and he has a bit of insight, was that they said, no, Xabi Alonso will end up at Bayern Munich this summer, and Vincent Kompany will go to Man City because Man City wants Vincent Kompany back and Xabi Alonso is an obvious fit for Bayern Munich.\n\n“Because he’s as much of a legend as he is at Liverpool. He’s also a great at Bayern Munich.”\n\nOgden anticipates a managerial “merry-go-round,” potentially leading to Pep Guardiola’s departure from the Etihad Stadium.\n\nThierry Henry has suggested that Manchester United’s board needs to establish a clear direction before making any decisions about their next permanent manager.\n\nMichael Carrick has been named interim head coach until the end of the season, but the next appointment will be a significant decision for Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada to make.\n\nCarrick’s tenure started well with a 2-0 win over Manchester City, thanks to goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu.\n\nSpeaking on Monday Night Football, Henry referenced his time at Barcelona, pointing out how the club’s strong sense of identity made managerial appointments much simpler.\n\n“The reality is what do they want Man United to be?” Henry said on Sky Sports (via Daily Mail).\n\n“What do they want, I don’t feel it from the outside. I don’t feel whatever they are looking at.\n\n“Bayern went to Vincent Kompany, we talked about Luis Enrique, we talked about Frank Rijkaard.\n\n“You can agree of disagree, you can see what type of coaches they want. I don’t know at Man United, I really don’t know what they are about now, what they want to achieve and what is the DNA.\n\n“I am talking about now when I watch the games. What Michael Carrick did at the weekend was brilliant, but in two weeks we could be talking about something else.\n\n“What do they want, how are they going to go about it? It should be clear in order to get one of the guys we are talking about.\n\n“The way they [Barcelona] see it on the other side, if you don’t fit who the house is, it doesn’t matter who you are or what you have done before.\n\n“If you fit what we believe in, you can come. But what are you to make that decision.”",

    "fullText": "Lawrence Stroll believes Aston Martin and Honda’s new partnership have “all the elements required to fight for victory” ahead of the 2026 F1 season.\n\nJapanese giant Honda, who formerly worked with Red Bull for seven seasons, held their own launch event as the new power unit supplier for Aston in Tokyo on Tuesday.\n\nAston, who have F1 design guru Adrian Newey as their team principal this season, have long targeted 2026’s new era of regulations as a starting point to work their way up the ladder and compete for race wins and world championships, having moved on from using Mercedes engines.\n\nThis year’s car will be the first that Newey has fully worked on and, six weeks out from the season opener in Australia, team owner Lawrence Stroll – father of driver Lance –was in an optimistic mood at the event in the Japanese capital.\n\nHe said: “The strong collaboration between the AMR [Aston Martin Racing] Technology Centre at Silverstone and Honda Racing Corporation (HRC) in Sakura demonstrates the depth of our partnership. We are confident that we have all the elements required to fight for victory in the future and we have tremendous faith in Honda’s Power Unit and the engineers behind it.\n\n“Our journey won’t always be easy and challenges inevitably lie ahead, but winning is what drives both companies forward and together we look forward to many successful years of partnership.”\n\nAston Martin chief strategy officer Andy Cowell, whom Newey replaced as team boss at the end of last season, was also present at the event alongside F1 chief executive Stefano Domenicali.\n\nHonda Motor Co. president Toshihiro Mibe added: “In 2026, F1 will undergo a major change in regulations for both the chassis and power unit. Honda sees F1 as a symbol of challenge and innovation, and HRC, the global racing arm of Honda, has developed the RA626H, the new power unit for the 2026 season, to meet those challenges.\n\n“Striving to become number one in the world, Honda will continue to take on challenges together with the Aston Martin Aramco Formula One Team.”\n\nAston, who also have two-time world champion Fernando Alonso as one of their drivers, unveil their 2026 car at a launch event in Ithra, Saudi Arabia, on Monday 8 February.\n\nAll 11 teams will be present at a private testing session next week in Barcelona, before two official tests in Bahrain next month.

And it has brought many victories,” Javier Zanetti said.\n\n“Everything has changed,” he added. “I believe that a top club like Inter, known worldwide, needs a new, state-of-the-art stadium.\n\n“The important thing is that it’s always at San Siro. I hope we’ll be able to create special memories there as well.”\n\nFinally, Zanetti named his most memorable game in the Nerazzurri shirt.\n\n“My debut game,” he claimed. “I could never have imagined it would be the first of 858 matches.”\n\nZanetti spent his entire professional career in Europe at Inter. Indeed, he joined the club in 1995 and stayed here until 2014.\n\nUpon retirement, the Nerazzurri retired his No.4 jersey, paying tribute to one of the most iconic figures in club history.\n\nHowever, Zanetti couldn’t stay away from his beloved Inter, returning to the club in a different capacity shortly after hanging up his boots.",

    "title": "Analysis: How the GTD Pro field fared in the 'Roar before the 24'",
    "description": "In the GTD Pro class, three updated vehicles took the top spots of the pre-Daytona test – as well as one intriguing outlier",
    "fullText": "With 15 cars from 10 different manufacturers, GTD Pro is set to be fiercely contested at the 2026 24 Hours of Daytona. With three models (Ferrari 296, Ford Mustang, and Porsche 911) having received \"Evo\" updates, the Balance of Performance officials faced an uphill challenge in balancing the field.\n\nFurthermore, in the GT3 classes, a certain amount of sandbagging is business as usual. No manufacturer wants to attract attention by showing too much pace during the pre-test. That’s why it is no surprise that three GTD cars posted a faster outright lap time than the best GTD Pro entry.\n\nLooking at the six sessions of the \"Roar before the 24\" (only Winward Racing participated in the seventh session due to its Bronze-rated driver), it is safe to say that the #75 75 Express Mercedes – driven by Kenny Habul, Maro Engel, Will Power Chaz Mostert – fully disclosed what it is capable of.\n\nSolar entrepreneur Habul’s team, which includes IndyCar superstar Power, secured four session best times.\n\nPower caused a red flag in the first session with a minor spin, but otherwise remained error-free. 75 Express Racing also leads the cumulative standings.\n\nThe other two session bests went to the #59 RLL-McLaren (session 1) and the #4 Pratt-Miller-Corvette (session 4).\n\n1. 75 Express Mercedes #75 (Habul/Engel/Power/Mostert) – 1:47.530 (session 6)\n2. Winward Mercedes #48 (Noble/Hart/Martin/Stolz) +0.115 (session 3)\n3. Pfaff Lamborghini #9 (Caldarelli/Mitchell/Bortolotti/Hinchcliffe) +0.189 (session 3)\n4. Multimatic Ford #65 (Mies/Vervisch/Priaulx) +0.230 (session 6)\n5. RLL McLaren #59 (Esterson/N. Johnson/Vips/MacDonald) +0.236 (session 1)\n6. Pratt Miller Corvette #3 (Garcia/Sims/Kirchhofer) +0.245 (session 6)\n7. Pratt Miller Corvette #4 (Milner/Catsburg/Varrone) +0.280 (session 4)\n8. GetSpeed Mercedes #69 (Bartone/Gotz/Gounon/Schiller) +0.321 (session 6)\n9. Multimatic Ford #64 (Barker/Olsen/Rockenfeller) +0.333 (session 3)\n10. Vasser Sullivan Lexus #14 (Hawksworth/Barnicoat/Kirkwood) +0.399 (session 6)\n11. Risi Ferrari #62 (Serra/Rigon/Pier Guidi) +0.424 (session 4)\n12. Manthey Porsche #911 (Preining/Bachler/Feller) +0.558 (session 4)\n13. Triarsi Ferrari #033 (Calado/Agostini/Rovera/Molina) +0.618 (session 4)\n14. Paul Miller BMW #1 (Verhagen/De Phillippi/Hesse/Harper) +0.879 (session 1)\n15. AO Porsche #77 (Tandy/King/Picariello) +0.892 (session 3)\n\nHabul set the best time of 1:47.530 – a remarkable feat for a Bronze-rated driver. However, the personal bests of Power (1:47.612) and Mostert (1:47.625) would have also been enough for the top spot. Engel did not participate in the Roar as he was competing in the 24 Hours of Dubai.\n\nBehind them follows a diverse field, with only Porsche and BMW lagging slightly behind.\n\nLong-run consistency is far more critical. For our analysis, we considered all laps under 1:53 minutes to calculate the average. Every GTD Pro car completed more than 100 laps in this range, providing a solid database:\n\n1. 75 Express Mercedes #75 – 1:48.803 (130 laps)\n2. Multimatic Ford #65 +0.213 (135 laps)\n3. Multimatic Ford #64 +0.226 (124 laps)\n4. Pratt Miller Corvette #3 +0.327 (121 laps)\n5. Risi Ferrari #62 +0.355 (108 laps)\n6. Vasser Sullivan Lexus #14 +0.382 (111 laps)\n7. Pratt Miller Corvette #4 +0.386 (148 laps)\n8. Pfaff Lamborghini #9 +0.408 (138 laps)\n9. Triarsi Ferrari #033 +0.509 (143 laps)\n10. GetSpeed Mercedes #69 +0.579 (137 laps)\n11. Manthey Porsche #911 +0.636 (143 laps)\n12. AO Porsche #77 +0.795 (121 laps)\n13. RLL McLaren #59 +0.843 (145 laps)\n14. Paul Miller BMW #1 +1.120 (111 laps)\n15. Winward Mercedes #48 +1.167 (137 laps)\n\n75 Express Racing maintains its lead, while Winward drops significantly. This is due to the driver line-up, which includes Bronze-rated Scott Noble and Silver driver Jason Hart, alongside two factory pros.\n\nFord appears to be the second-strongest force, slightly detached from the rest of the field.\n\nThe gap for Porsche and BMW is striking. In BMW’s case, it is particularly surprising as the M4 GT3 Evo is in its second year and fought for the podium last year with a less favourable BoP.\n\nThe RLL McLaren also loses ground. However, we must not forget that Nikita Johnson is Silver-rated, and both Juri Vips and Max Esterson are new to GT3 racing. Dean MacDonald serves as the benchmark for the trio.\n\nTo analyse \"sprint qualities,\" we filtered the top 20% of all laps under 1:53 minutes. This reveals some interesting shifts:\n\n1. 75 Express Mercedes #75 – 1:47.890 min\n2. Multimatic Ford #65 +0.275\n3. Pfaff Lamborghini #9 +0.283\n4. GetSpeed Mercedes #69 +0.283\n5. Pratt Miller Corvette #3 +0.319\n6. Winward Mercedes #48 +0.319\n7. Pratt Miller Corvette #4 +0.391\n8. Vasser Sullivan Lexus #14 +0.394\n9. Risi Ferrari #62 +0.434\n10. Multimatic Ford #64 +0.437\n11. RLL McLaren #59 +0.480\n12. Triarsi Ferrari #033 +0.507\n13. Manthey Porsche #911 +0.556\n14. AO Porsche #77 +0.820\n15. Paul Miller BMW #1 +0.829\n\n75 Express Racing dominates this category as well. Its lead is even larger here, thanks to an extraordinary number of laps in the 1:47s. While the \"Solar Express\" clocked 20 laps under 1:48 minutes, no other manufacturer came close – the second-placed Ford #65 managed only five.\n\nAs expected, the other two Mercedes-AMG GT3s climb the rankings in this statistic, reflecting the influence of their factory drivers. From second place downwards, the field is separated by just over half a second, with Lamborghini making up some ground. Once again, Porsche and BMW find themselves at the bottom of the list.\n\nMercedes-AMG is showing extreme strength. However, since the three drivers for the #75 are not factory-contracted, they likely showed their full potential. Race week will reveal who has the most reserves left – or if anyone receives a last-minute BoP adjustment.\n\nAnalysis: How the GTP manufacturers fared in the 'Roar before the 24'\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "UFC commentator Jon Anik has sparked controversy with his choice for the main event of the UFC White House card, and fans aren’t impressed.\n\nThe event is scheduled for June 14, and the promotion is pitching it as one of the most ambitious spectacles in MMA history. Fans are already calling it UFC 304. The bout will take place on a specially constructed outdoor cage set up on the White House lawn.\n\nSince Donald Trump made his intention to host a UFC card at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue clear, anticipation has only increased as more details have emerged. But despite growing hype, fans are still waiting to find out who will headline.\n\nAnik appeared on The MMA Hour and discussed the idea with Ariel Helwani:\n\n“The volume of tickets that was required for this fight card was such that we had to come back,” he said. “It’s similar in some respects to what happened with McGregor/Fiziev where there was just so much demand.”\n\nJon Anik has shared his thoughts on the UFC White House main event, though fans might not be thrilled with what he’s suggesting.\n\nFrom the moment it was announced, Conor McGregor and Jon Jones both put their hands up to headline the event. But Dana White’s recent comments about not being able to trust Jones, combined with his dismissal of McGregor vs Michael Chandler, suggest neither fighter is likely to get the nod.\n\nSpeaking to TMZ Sports, Anik said: “So I think you probably have to do the heavyweight championship, we gotta see Tom Aspinall vs Ciryl Gane again. I know a lot of fans want to see Jon Jones vs Alex Pereira. I think it remains to be seen whether or not that fight will actually happen.”\n\n“I think you go Petr Yan vs Merab Dvalishvili in the co-main event for the bantamweight title. I am hopeful that we get four or five undisputed titles on the White House lawn, June 14.”\n\nDespite Anik suggesting Petr Yan vs Merab Dvalishvili as co-main event, ‘The Machine’ recently stated that he was told by UFC officials Yan won’t be part of the card due to his nationality.\n\n“The UFC told me I’m next for the belt. They said there will be a trilogy between me and Yan. They also told me that our fight will not happen at the White House in June because (Yan) is Russian, and that’s impossible,” Dvalishvili said.\n\nEven though fans are eager to see a rematch between Tom Aspinall and Ciryl Gane following the controversial finish to their UFC 321 title fight, many aren’t keen on that bout headlining such a high-profile card.\n\nThe criticism didn’t stop there, as other fans questioned whether an American should feature in the main event given the location.\n\n“A French and an English fighter on Capitol of US ground? Yeah, alright,” one fan said.\n\n“Brit vs French? No American?” another questioned.\n\nHowever, despite the backlash against his pick for the main event, Anik does seem to have hit on a co-main event that fans would support if it were possible. The issue is that Merab Dvalishvili claims Petr Yan won’t be allowed to compete at the White House event due to his Russian nationality.\n\nDvalishvili explained: “The UFC told me I’m next for the belt. They said there will be a trilogy between me and Yan. They also told me that our fight will not happen at the White House in June because (Yan) is Russian, and that’s impossible.”",

    "description": "Liverpool’s so far wasted 2025-26 season sees their re-built midfield all approaching contract crunch time.",
    "fullText": "In the midst of a Liverpool season that hasn’t gone to plan, with long stretches of both underwhelming results and disappointing performances, one of the most consistent positive standouts has been that of star midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai.\n\nThe 25-year-old Hungarian has shone in his third season on Merseyside, having arrived at the club in summer 2023 from RB Leipzig after Liverpool triggered his £60M release clause. That he’s into his third season, though, means it’s time to start worrying about contract.\n\nThe deal Szoboszlai signed when he joined the club was for five years, meaning at the end of the season he will have just two years left to run—and that means now is when all parties would typically seek to extend his stay or start thinking about a sale.\n\n“There are always talks,” Szoboszlai acknowledged this week when asked about his contract situation. “The media talk a lot because that’s your job and there have been talks but for sure not any decision has been made. There is always progress but no decision has been made.\n\n“I’ll just keep on going every week, every training, giving my best for the team, for the fans, so let’s see what is going to happen in the future. I am happy here but you know how football works and that is something everybody has to take into account.”\n\nWhile Liverpool might prefer a do-over for the current disappointment of a season, the unfortunate reality is of course that while the Reds tread water their key players are all getting a year older and seeing a year tick off their contracts, a situation going well beyond Szoboszlai.\n\nAlong with Szoboszlai, Liverpool rebuilt their midfield with Alexis Mac Allister and Ryan Gravenberch in 2023. All are in the same contract situation. Typically, as value drops in the final year, two years out is the best time to sell a player if they will not extend.",

    "description": "Helmut Marko says Max Verstappen has matured into a self-sufficient team leader and believes he can win more F1 titles if Red Bull gives him the right car",
    "fullText": "Former Red Bull motorsport adviser Dr Helmut Marko has applauded Max Verstappen's growth in Formula 1 as he explains he's at a point in his career where he longer needs guidance.\n\nMarko has been instrumental in the four-time champion's journey in the series. The Austrian oversaw the development of young drivers while running the Red Bull Junior Team, during which time he nurtured Verstappen and fellow four-time F1 champion Sebastian Vettel, among many others.\n\nThe 82-year-old decided to step down from his role at the Milton Keynes outfit at the end of 2025 and has since spoken about Verstappen's progress in the team during an interview with F1 Insider.\n\nThe Dutchman quickly matured in the championship. Since joining Toro Rosso (now Racing Bulls) at the age of 17, Verstappen has become much more level-headed in his approach and Marko explained that he is now a leader within the team.\n\n\"Max is now a father, has cats and dogs, a balanced life – and is clearly one of the greats in motorsport, if not the greatest,\" Marko said. \"But he has developed to such an extent that he no longer needs guidance. It would be presumptuous of me to add anything to that. In that sense, it's a good solution.\"\n\nMarko and Verstappen have a strong relationship. Opening up about telling Verstappen about his decision to leave Red Bull, Marko added: \"We had arranged to have dinner in Dubai, and I wanted to tell him then, because I had just had a conversation with Oliver Mintzlaff.\n\n\"But then there was a problem with his plane, and I couldn't tell him in person. However, I called him the next day and explained. We talked about the past, not nostalgically, but: what we've achieved is something no one could have imagined.\"\n\nMarko believes Verstappen will win several more championship titles if he is given the right car.\n\n\"For Max, it's not over yet,\" he continued. \"I don't see any end to his abilities, his incredible driving skills, and his technical intuition. If the right car is available, he'll win several more world championship titles.\"\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

Yields climbed to their highest level in more than four months as \"Sell America\" fears gripped markets amid the latest geopolitical tensions. The US Dollar Index also moved lower.\n\n\"Europe owns Greenland, it also owns a lot of Treasuries,\" wrote George Saravelos, Deutsche Bank's global head of currency research, in a note on Sunday.\n\nThat exposure highlights a key vulnerability for the US, which depends heavily on foreign investors to finance its debt.\n\nEuropean countries own around $8 trillion of US bonds and equities — almost twice as much as the rest of the world combined, according to Deutsche.\n\n\"For all its military and economic strength, the US has one key weakness: it relies on others to pay its bills via large external deficits,\" Saravelos added.\n\nHe pointed out that Danish pension funds were among the first to repatriate capital and cut dollar exposure last year in response to uncertainty over Trump's policies. Saravelos also warned that dollar exposure across Europe remains elevated.\n\n\"In an environment where the geoeconomic stability of the western alliance is being disrupted existentially, it is not clear why Europeans would be as willing to play this part,\" Saravelos said.\n\nBeyond currencies, Saravelos said the real risk lies in capital markets as the US is more vulnerable to foreign investors than ever before.\n\n\"It is a weaponization of capital rather than trade flows that would by far be the most disruptive to markets,\" he wrote.\n\nThat risk is already starting to be priced in, according to Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone.\n\n\"The market dynamic we are seeing increasing evidence of is that US assets (including the USD) are now carrying a much higher political risk premium,\" Weston wrote on Monday.\n\nThat shift could push foreign investors to reduce their US exposure and adjust how much dollar risk they hold, weighing on the currency and boosting haven assets like gold, he added.\n\nOn Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed market speculation that Europe could dump its US assets in retaliation for Trump's tariff threat over Greenland.\n\n\"There is no talk in European governments,\" Bessent told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, calling it a \"completely false narrative.\"\n\n\"It defies any logic, and I could not disagree more strongly on that.\"",

    "fullText": "I'm reporting from Davos, Switzerland, where thousands of business leaders and politicians have arrived at the World Economic Forum to shake hands, talk shop, and maybe even eke out a few ski runs.\n\nSome executives I've spoken to this week had some big concerns about AI, but none of them had anything to do with a potential bubble.\n\nRaj Sharma, EY's global managing partner of growth and innovation, said there's not enough talk about AI security — specifically, the management of AI agents and their lifecycle.\n\n\"It has access to your data. It has no name, so there is no identity or anything associated with that,\" Sharma said.\n\nCompare that to humans, where every computer system and piece of data they touch is often tracked.\n\n\"We have to build industrial-level security for AI agents in that particular area. To me, that's still a gap that somebody needs to work on,\" Sharma said. \"Everybody's talking a good game. But if you look under the covers, it's still not mature.\"\n\n\"That keeps me up at night,\" Sharma added.\n\nHe's not alone. Tim Walsh, the CEO of KPMG US, told me the biggest issue he talks to CEOs about regularly is cyber risk, specifically related to AI.\n\nAI agents are the latest twist in executives' ongoing concerns over cybersecurity, and it's proving to be an incredibly challenging problem. Somewhat ironically, the only way to fight the threat is with … more AI.\n\nIn some cases, the risk has gotten so big that it's shifting timelines on companies' AI plans.\n\n\"It's not that they're not moving forward, but they are taking a moment to make sure that their environment is secure, and perhaps even leaving data on-prem a little bit longer so they're confident that got their data security in place,\" Walsh told me.\n\nWalsh said another \"real concern\" is the threat of quantum computing from a security perspective.\n\nWhile he acknowledged we're still a few years out from the tech being fully developed, its power is incredible.\n\n\"Quantum breaks everything,\" Walsh said. \"I mean, all encryption.\"\n\nThat's led companies to look at their systems and reencrypting things, no easy task.\n\n\"We're spending quite a bit of time as well, helping companies think through: What does that look like? How do you structure it? How long will it take?\" Walsh said.",

    "description": "China's EV boom came from stable policy, while policy changes elsewhere are holding the transition back, a BYD executive says.",
    "fullText": "The global EV transition has a policy problem, says BYD executive vice president Stella Li.\n\nLi said in a panel session on EVs on the second day at Davos that governments keep changing the rules about EVs. The stop-start approach makes it harder for automakers to commit capital, plan product cycles, or build supply chains with confidence, even as competition across the EV markets in China, the US, and Europe heats up.\n\nLi said that when countries go \"back and forth\" on their EV policy, it creates a pattern that \"will confuse manufacturers.\"\n\nIn contrast, when governments give a \"very clear line,\" automakers can focus on execution, Li said.\n\nThat inconsistency has real consequences, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said on the same panel.\n\n\"The back and forth policies at the national level have made it more difficult for industry to throw all in and ramp up the way that some of the Chinese companies have been able to,\" she added.\n\nElaine Buckberg, former chief economist at General Motors, said on the panel that automakers typically plan vehicles five years before launch and expect to sell them for years afterward. Stable, long-term regulations are critical for companies expanding into EVs.\n\n\"Keeping those incentives stable, that's really powerful,\" she said. \"That's a place where the US is really pulling back under the Trump administration.\"\n\nChina has a clear lead over the US in electric vehicles, Li and two of her co-panelists said.\n\nLi said consumer demand, rapidly improving technology, and China's dense charging network are accelerating adoption and making EVs a practical choice for everyday drivers.\n\nIn China, EVs are not only bringing a \"sustainable future,\" but also bringing \"innovation,\" Li said.\n\nIndustry leaders have been vocal about China's dominance in the global EV market.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley said in an episode of The Verge's \"Decoder\" podcast in September that \"the Chinese are the 700-pound gorilla in the EV industry.\"\n\n\"There's no real competition from Tesla, GM, or Ford with what we've seen from China. It is completely dominating the EV landscape globally and more and more outside of China,\" he added.\n\nFarley said that China has \"great innovation at a very low cost,\" and that companies have \"huge subsidies\" and are sponsored by their local governments.\n\nChina's government poured at least $230 billion into supporting domestic EV makers between 2009 and 2023, according to a 2024 report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\"There's no secret magic thing that you're like, 'Oh, aha, they did this.' But rather it's the compounding benefits of a lower cost of capital,\" said Rivian's CEO, RJ Scaringe, in an episode of the \"Everything Electric\" podcast published in September.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump wrapped up his first year in his second term. Here's how inflation, the job market, tariffs, and spending have evolved.",
    "fullText": "The US experienced the smallest job growth outside a recession since 2003 last year, adding just 584,000 jobs.\n\nDraho said overall policy uncertainty, tariffs, immigration, and fears of a recession from months ago have been factors.\n\n\"It's made companies a little more reluctant to invest, to hire, if you're not sure how much of an overall economic drag that tariffs would have,\" Draho said about overall uncertainty. \"So even if your company may not be directly affected by tariffs, just the uncertainty of how this could play out would be a bit of a negative.\"\n\nEconomists and job-market experts have said that the slower job market is unsustainable. Renter said it could affect consumer spending if it doesn't reverse course.\n\n\"How we feel about our income plays a big role in how we spend, and I think the longer this uncertainty and the longer this labor market chill sort of sits over us, the more that a greater number of households are going to start tightening their purse strings,\" Renter said.\n\nGregory Daco, the chief economist at EY, said the economy is showing resilience despite a jobless expansion.\n\n\"That's been really the key defining factor of the US economy in the face of a number of cross-currents, from significant shifts in trade policy and tariffs to industrial policy, to significant shifts in immigration dynamics, to now an AI-led technological revolution,\" he said.\n\nReal GDP grew in the second and third quarters of 2025 after falling in the first, as businesses prepared for new tariffs.\n\nWhile economic growth has been strong, Daco thinks a jobless boom will continue because an aging population and a drop in net migration are affecting the supply of workers at the same time as less demand for new workers.\n\n\"Businesses are very cautious as to who they hire and at what rate they hire because they don't necessarily need as much talent as they did a year or two years ago,\" Daco said.\n\nOne of the Trump administration's goals was to increase efficiency within the federal government. That led to several actions to shrink the workforce, including reduction-in-force and buyouts led by the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics data showed a massive drop in federal employment in October because people who had taken deferred resignations officially came off the government payrolls.\n\nCameron Hilaker, an AFGE Local 1534 member, was an emergency manager for US Agency for International Development before being laid off last spring. He is still looking for work and has become a stay-at-home dad. Without his government paycheck, Hilaker and his wife can't comfortably afford childcare for their new baby.\n\n\"We were fully unprepared for this,\" Hilaker said. \"All of a sudden, I am at home with my son because we're not paying daycare. We can't afford another $2,500 a month expense. Budgets are tight.\"\n\nThe manufacturing sector continued its trend of job losses or weak job growth that had been underway before Trump took office.\n\n\"Part of the justification for tariffs was bringing manufacturing back to the US,\" Renter said, adding it would be costly and could take years to do that, \"if even possible.\"\n\nShe added that tariffs have likely had a negative effect on the sector, with manufacturing firms that rely on imports taking a hit.\n\n\"The Fed's industrial production measure is now at its highest level since 2019, clearly reversing its Biden era decline,\" Desai said. \"Meanwhile, core capital goods shipments have hit an all-time high under President Trump, signaling strong investment into future manufacturing production and jobs.\"\n\nA blog post from the St. Louis Fed showed that the effective import tariff rate and tariff revenue as a share of gross domestic product have spiked.\n\n\"Both rates jumped noticeably in 2018 during the first trade war, more or less doubling by 2022,\" the blog post said.\n\nThere has been a lot of back-and-forth on tariffs. The administration has announced tariffs on different goods, including some wines, cars, and furniture. Some tariffs are no longer in effect or pushed back — tariffs on coffee, spices, beef, and more were stopped in November. The Supreme Court is also expected to rule on the legality of many of the tariffs soon.\n\nThe inflation rate has cooled down a lot since it surged to about 9% in 2022, but it remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. In 2025, it slowed in the first few months before speeding up and then holding steady in December.\n\nDraho said the inflation rate climbed higher than expected, with tariffs having a small effect.\n\n\"I knew retailers and producers would be reluctant to pass along cost increases to consumers. I didn't imagine that they would be able to hold the line for quite so long,\" Renter said.\n\nRenter believes tariffs will continue to affect inflation because they are affecting a variety of items, so their effect is trickling in instead of causing a one-time increase in prices. \"It's tough, really, to know how much of the spikes in price growth can be attributed to tariffs and how much might be attributed to other issues like supply chain issues, demand-driven issues, which makes monetary policy a little more difficult,\" she said.\n\nDespite economic uncertainty, spending has been strong. However, like much else in the economy, consumer spending has taken on a \"K-shape,\" where wealthier people are spending big while lower-income Americans are cutting back. Draho said this is likely more of a structural pattern that existed before Trump's term.\n\n\"Much of the robust spending that we've seen over the past year has been driven primarily by people with assets and people with high incomes,\" Renter said. \"If you're invested in the stock market, you're probably doing pretty well right now. If you own your home, and especially if you have owned your home for more than a handful of years, you're probably feeling pretty secure right now. And I think the bulk of the spending has been coming from these groups of people.\"",

    "title": "Inside Amazon's 'mind-blowing' plan to fix groceries and beat Walmart",
    "description": "Internal documents show Amazon is reshaping its retail infrastructure to compete head-on with Walmart's Supercenter model.",
    "fullText": "For years, Amazon was cast as Walmart's great disruptor. Now, it's borrowing from the retail giant it once sought to upend.\n\nThe company is rolling out Walmart-inspired ideas, including \"Supercenter\" warehouses, a new distribution layer known internally as the \"1DC\" network, and microfulfillment centers within Whole Foods stores, according to internal documents obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe shift reflects a hard lesson: mastery of e-commerce does not translate into dominance in groceries, particularly perishable items that drive frequent shopping. Walmart's dense network of stores and distribution centers, designed to move everyday goods quickly and cheaply, has proved difficult to replicate.\n\nNearly a decade after paying $13.7 billion for Whole Foods, Amazon still trails Walmart in everyday grocery shopping, and is now reshaping its retail infrastructure to compete head-on with Walmart's Supercenter model.\n\nEarlier this month, plans emerged for a roughly 225,000-square-foot Amazon megastore near Chicago. Bigger than a typical Walmart Supercenter, the new concept is designed to let customers buy \"fresh groceries, household essentials, and general merchandise — all in one trip,\" according to Amazon.\n\nMichael Levin and Josh Lowitz, cofounders of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, called the move \"mind-blowing\" and said \"it reveals a degree of Walmart jealousy that we didn't expect.\"\n\nThere's a lot to be jealous about. With roughly 90% of the US population estimated to live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, the company's 5,000-plus locations give it a powerful edge in selling fresh food and other perishables, along with many other everyday staples.\n\nAccording to research firm Numerator, Walmart accounted for about 21% of the US grocery market, both online and in-store, as of September. Amazon and Whole Foods, meanwhile, each held roughly 1.6% of the market.\n\nMeanwhile, Walmart is leveraging its Supercenters to deliver online orders faster, challenging Amazon at its own game.\n\nThat's fueled a surge in Walmart shares, valuing the company close to $1 trillion. The stock is up almost 150% over 5 years, far outpacing Amazon's roughly 53% gain (although Amazon is still worth more).\n\nAmazon does well with non-perishable goods and everyday essentials such as toothpaste and paper towels. Overall, it offers millions of products for same-day delivery.\n\nBut when it comes to more delicate food items, such as pears, meat, and cheese, the company knows it has more work to do.\n\nA company spokesperson said Amazon serves more than 150 million US grocery customers, offers nearly 3 million grocery and household items, and provides same-day delivery in more than 9,000 cities and towns.\n\nGrocery is an \"ever-growing\" part of its fast-delivery business, the spokesperson added, while noting that in 2025, Amazon added perishable groceries to its Same-Day Delivery service, now available in 2,300 locations, allowing customers to shop without trade-offs between speed, selection, and savings.\n\nOne element of this fresh Amazon effort is a new type of same-day delivery warehouse internally called an \"SSD Supercenter.\" SSD refers to sub-same-day deliveries, typically within four hours. Unlike traditional SSD warehouses that tend to be smaller, these facilities are designed to be larger to close the selection gap, specifically with \"Walmart\" in groceries, the document said.\n\nInternal planning documents show Amazon intended to launch at least five such sites last year. Amazon wanted to test whether customers would \"step-change their shopping habituation and engagement\" once the Supercenter warehouses went live, one of the documents stated. Amazon planned to add products not currently sold on its site to the new warehouse and take a more hands-on approach to inventory sourcing, with in-stock targets above 95%, according to the document.\n\nSub-same-day grocery delivery is still a tiny part of Amazon's business. At the end of September, it had 30 million eligible customers for this service, according to one of the internal documents obtained by Business Insider. Only 1.6 million of them, or roughly 5%, shopped through the service.\n\nAmazon's Supercenter warehouses are part of a broader push to expand same-day grocery delivery. Internal forecasts called for at least 34 US same-day grocery sites in 2025. Amazon already operates over 80 same-day facilities nationwide, though not all handle groceries, according to Marc Wulfraat, president of logistics consultancy MWPVL.\n\nAmazon is also planning to take the model overseas. Under an initiative known as Project Taylor, the company plans to expand sub-same-day grocery delivery across Europe. It also plans to pilot sub-two-hour \"ultrafast\" deliveries in London in 2026, one of the documents showed.\n\nLess visible, but just as important, is a new upstream distribution layer called \"1DC.\"\n\nThese facilities store the most frequently purchased products and replenish fulfillment centers as demand emerges. That can shift weeks' worth of inventory out of space-constrained fulfillment centers and into distribution sites optimized for palletized storage and rapid transfer.\n\nOne internal document described the change as a move from a \"push\" system, in which inventory is positioned based on forecasts, to a \"pull\" system that allows fulfillment centers to draw inventory from distribution centers as needed.\n\nAmazon began rolling out the 1DC concept last year through new buildings and retrofits. By the end of 2025, the company planned to operate a dozen of these centers, capable of moving at least 20 million units a week, according to one of the documents. As of October 2025, the facilities only handled non-perishables, including shelf-stable food items, but not frozen or chilled products, the document stated.\n\nThe 1DC idea emerged after Amazon introduced one-day delivery in 2018, one of the documents stated. Longer delivery windows once allowed the company to rely on a single layer of warehouses that could ship inventory from any fulfillment center to any customer. But faster delivery promises made that model \"untenable,\" forcing Amazon toward a structure long used by traditional retailers, the document added.\n\nMWPVL's Wulfraat said Walmart pioneered the distribution-center model that stores inventory for replenishing retail locations, while Amazon built its business around fulfillment centers that ship directly to consumers. Amazon also operates a cross-dock network to resupply its fulfillment centers, he said, and the 1DC sites represent a newer, more targeted layer of that system focused on high-velocity items.\n\nAmazon's spokesperson told Business Insider that 1DC is part of a broader initiative the company previously announced to regionalize its delivery operations and reduce shipping costs.\n\nPerhaps the clearest signal of Amazon's shift is its rethinking of Whole Foods. Once positioned mainly as a premium grocer, the chain is increasingly treated as logistics infrastructure.\n\nAmazon has begun installing micro-fulfillment centers in the back of select stores, effectively turning them into local hubs for online orders.\n\nOne upgraded Whole Foods site in suburban Philadelphia, announced last year, now fulfills Amazon orders from the back of the store. The model lets shoppers buy Whole Foods-specific items while also ordering products available only on Amazon, reducing the need to shop at other retailers.\n\nAmazon expects this store to serve roughly 100,000 e-commerce units a week by consolidating deliveries from nearby stores, and forecasts online order adoption to grow to 10% by the end of 2026, according to one of the documents.\n\nThis approach also mirrors Walmart's strategy of using its stores to fulfill online orders. Walmart said last year that it can offer same-day delivery to 93% of US households through its store-fulfilled network, with about 35% of those orders arriving within three hours.\n\nThe success of Amazon's new approach depends on one of the hardest problems in logistics: perishables.\n\nInternal plans show Amazon aiming to expand its perishables distribution capacity from 2.6 billion units in 2025 to 3.3 billion units by the end of 2026. The increase would come from new distribution centers and tighter operational standards across the existing network.\n\nThe push is central to Amazon's same-day delivery strategy and its broader grocery ambitions. Company documents stress that delivering high-quality perishables quickly and reliably is essential to scaling the business.\n\nThe goal is expansive. One document calls for making perishables available to \"100% of Prime customers\" as quickly as possible.\n\nHave a tip?

    "title": "Citi has quietly built a 4,000-person internal AI workforce",
    "description": "Around 4,000 employees globally have volunteered to fan out across their business units as \"AI accelerators.\"",
    "fullText": "At Citi, some of the people leading the Wall Street bank's AI push aren't part of a specialized tech team. They're colleagues a few desks over.\n\nThose employees are part of the bank's AI Champions and Accelerators program, which got off the ground in early 2024 and now counts around 4,000 people among its ranks of voluntary AI helpers. At its most basic level, the program aims to have the designated \"accelerators\" help colleagues within their business units leverage and understand AI tools. The program's approximately 25-30 \"champions\" help lead the accelerators in their line of business.\n\nCiti's program is one of many ways banks are racing to adopt AI, from offering engineers capstone-style courses to luring top tech talent by promising a seat at powerful managerial tables. To date, Citi's AI tools are available in 84 countries for 182,000 employees. Adoption of the firm's proprietary tools is above 70%, Citi CEO Jane Fraser told analysts during the bank's earnings call last week.\n\nAnd it's clear that she has high expectations for all employees, including accelerators. In a January memo, she told staff she expected \"a more disciplined, more confident\" workforce in 2026, and that AI will likely \"reshape how work gets done.\"\n\nAmong the bank's range of initiatives to encourage AI uptake, the accelerators and champions model is uniquely embedded throughout teams and based on peer-to-peer interactions, said Carey Ryan, one of the initiative's leaders and the chief of staff for the technology organization.\n\n\"A small central team would never be able to reach where we are now,\" Ryan said.\n\nTech leaders at Citi came up with the program when brainstorming how to engage a wider swath of its population with AI, Ryan said. Originally, her team only planned to have 2,500 accelerators, but they saw more interest than expected and still maintain a waitlist for the program.\n\nWhile colleagues nominate champions for the position, anyone can volunteer to be an accelerator. The only requirement is being excited about AI, Ryan said.\n\nJosh Goldsmith is the AI champion for internal audit, where he's also the head of digital solutions and innovation. He's been a part of the program since its inception, and said that \"demystifying AI\" is among its greatest successes so far.\n\n\"It's a lot different when you hear from a colleague as to how you can leverage these tools, as opposed to having someone who's, let's say, a technologist trying to push this,\" he said. \"To be able to see someone put it in action: 'Hey, they can do it! I'm just like them, I can do it as well.'\"\n\nRyan also said that the peer-to-peer approach is part of what makes the initiative work, since a more general team couldn't understand all of the job-specific AI use cases across the bank. She added that accelerators have helped host more than 100 Citi AI Days, where they hold demonstrations and answer questions.\n\nAccelerators meet with their cohorts two times each month to participate in demos, learn about new tools, get training, or talk about their recent work. Goldsmith oversees around 50 participants; between attending their meetings and his own bi-monthly champion meetings, he said he devotes between three and five hours to the program each week, on top of his usual job.\n\nThe program members can also opt into trainings on topics including agentic AI to earn visual \"AI badges,\" which they can include in their email signatures. There are no specific engagement metrics, though, and people can drop out of the program if it becomes too demanding a time commitment.\n\n\"One accelerator might have five interactions, and maybe they're five small interactions,\" Ryan said. \"Another accelerator might have one really big interaction, where they're doing something with hundreds of people.\"\n\nAmong the AI peer coaches in internal audit, between 70% and 80% have stayed in the program, Goldsmith said. He added that, despite the extra hours, participating has given him a broader perspective on AI across Citi, and \"a clear vision in terms of what's coming next.\"\n\nFor Carey, there's something of a symbiotic relationship between program leads, participants, and the rest of the bank. Accelerators will explain what they're hearing from their lines of business — where people are struggling, what they might need — as Citi continues to fine-tune its approach to AI. They have, for example, helped Citi tweak AI tools, suggesting enhancements like adding notifications and allowing employees to upload larger files.\n\n\"It's an important conduit for feedback back in,\" she said.",

    "title": "Nearly half of gig workers sell or share accounts for driving and making deliveries — highlighting a big security risk",
    "description": "Despite bans on doing so from apps like Uber and DoorDash, some gig workers are renting or selling accounts to others, a new TransUnion survey found.",
    "fullText": "Gig workers turn to apps like Uber and DoorDash to make money by offering rides and making deliveries.\n\nSome independent contractors have come up with another way to make money using the apps: Selling access to those apps to other people, according to a new survey.\n\nForty-five percent of gig workers surveyed by TransUnion said that they had either rented or sold access to a gig work account on a gig work platform, the company said in a report released last week.\n\nGig work apps such as Uber, DoorDash, and Walmart's Spark have told Business Insider that they don't allow users to share their accounts with other people. It can pose a safety risk to the apps and the people who rely on them, since the apps vet workers when they sign up.\n\nTwenty-five percent of the gig workers surveyed said they had rented out their account, while 20% said they had sold an account. Meanwhile, 45% said they had never done either.\n\nThe survey, which was conducted in August, asked 1,012 adults who were either current gig workers, had recently quit gig work, or were about to start doing gig work.\n\nOn Facebook, Telegram, and other social media platforms, users can find ads offering to sell or rent accounts for gig work apps. Many also offer third-party programs, called \"bots\" by gig workers, which claim to give users an edge in claiming deliveries.\n\nAt Walmart, some Spark delivery drivers have shown up at stores or customers' homes using names that don't appear to match who they actually are, Business Insider reported in 2023. Walmart has since taken additional steps to verify who its delivery workers are, such as asking them to stop by a store and show their ID.\n\nThiry said prospective gig workers might buy or rent accounts for several reasons, such as not having a long enough driving history or being unable to pass a background check.\n\nIn some parts of the US, there are also waitlists of people trying to work for some apps.\n\nSharing accounts with other people violates the terms of service for major gig work apps.\n\nUber says on its support site that it has \"zero tolerance for confirmed complaints of this nature,\" for example. A company spokesperson said that users who share their accounts risk \"losing access to the Uber platform permanently.\" Last year, Uber required all its drivers and delivery workers to reverify their identities.\n\nA DoorDash spokesperson also confirmed that the company removes workers from its app for sharing accounts. In 2024, DoorDash said it began requiring more frequent identity verification for some delivery workers to crack down on account sharing.\n\nTransUnion, which provides identity verification services for apps and websites, asked gig workers about renting or selling accounts after seeing an uptick in suspicious activity, Colleen Thiry, director of TransUnion's gig economy business, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Our data was showing some signals of workers selling their accounts,\" Thiry said, such as accounts that were long associated with Android smartphones suddenly showing up on an iPhone.\n\nTransUnion and the platforms follow up in such cases to verify the user's identity, Thiry said. In some cases, there's an innocent explanation: perhaps a gig worker logged into their account for the first time on a new phone.\n\nThere are other types of suspicious activity in gig work, TransUnion's survey found. Forty-three percent of gig workers surveyed said they have experienced tip-baiting, in which a customer offers a high tip only to cut it after the gig worker agrees to complete the order or trip.\n\nThat practice can be demotivating for gig workers, TransUnion's analysis of the survey said.\n\nFraud poses risks to the companies behind gig-work apps since both workers and customers need security, TransUnion's Thiry said.\n\n\"Both sides of that transaction need to feel safe and secure,\" Thiry said.\n\nHave a tip?

CEO Tony Xu said on an earnings call in November that DoorDash would invest hundreds of millions of dollars this year in key initiatives, including a global tech platform for all its brands and autonomous tech.\n\nDoorDash employees don't just work on big problems, though.

It all worked out.\"\n\nBessent, speaking to the press on Tuesday morning, urged calm amid President Donald Trump's latest slate of trade tariffs on Greenland.\n\n\"You say: 'If there is a protracted trade war.' Why are we jumping there? Why are you taking it to the worst case? Calm down the hysteria, take a deep breath, this is where we were last year,\" Bessentt said. \"I'm sure you would have asked me the same question if we were here on April 2nd. And you know what? It all worked out.\"\n\nWhen asked about what European business leaders should do, Bessent's take was to \"sit back\" and \"relax.\"\n\n\"What I am urging everyone here to do is sit back, take a deep breath, and let things play out,\" Bessent said.\n\n\"I am confident that the leaders will not escalate and that this will work out in a manner that ends up in a very good place for all, for national security, for the US, and for Europe,\" he said.\n\nAnything you do within your company's digital ecosystem is likely being tracked, from the data you touch to the software programs you use.\n\nThat's a real concern as we rely on them more and more, Raj Sharma, EY's global managing partner of growth and innovation, told me.\n\n\"We have to build industrial-level security for AI agents in that particular area,\" he said. \"That keeps me up at night,\" Sharma added.\n\nFor Tim Walsh, the chair and CEO of KPMG US, it's the threat of quantum computing. While still a few years out, its power is undeniable.\n\n\"Quantum breaks everything,\" Walsh said. \"I mean, all encryption.\"\n\n\"M&A is high on the agenda,\" said Sharon Marcil, North America chair at BCG. \"We're hearing it from so many CEOs.\" She pointed to a strong stock market and an overall tilt in Washington toward deregulation and robust business activity.\n\nWinston Weinberg, CEO and cofounder of the legal AI startup Harvey, echoes the sentiment, saying he is hearing that 2026 will be an \"insane\" year for dealmaking.

Especially in a world of competing ideologies and assumptions about how the system should work,\" he said.\n\nFink's remarks ground what is expected to be a monumental week, in which deals are made and new alliances are forged amid turmoil in the wider political sphere.",

    "description": "Bill Shufelt, the CEO of Athletic Brewing, spends the day at his brewery and gets a lot of work done while his family sleeps.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Bill Shufelt, the founder and CEO of Athletic Brewing. Shufelt founded the nonalcoholic beer company in 2017, which has since has driven over 23% of N/A beer category growth over the last seven years. Shufelt lives in Connecticut, near one of the breweries (he occasionally travels to the other brewery in San Diego). This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI cut back on drinking as my fitness journey accelerated. As a day trader, I was used to taking 4:30 a.m. group boxing classes before I started work at 6:00 a.m. In my late 20s, I started running ultramarathons. I stopped drinking alcohol in 2013, and it was one of the biggest life hacks I ever discovered. I had all this newfound energy, better sleep, better workouts — and no hangovers.\n\nIt's also how I learned there was a real void of good nonalcoholic options. I loved socializing; I love good food and good beer, being out with my colleagues and family. But there was just nothing out there. It was definitely awkward — if I were at a work dinner and had to ask for a non-alcoholic menu, it felt like the whole room would stop and look at me.\n\nWhen I asked any of my friends or family, no matter how much they drank, from never to very often, almost everyone uniformly and enthusiastically said they'd be interested in nonalcoholic beer options. At the time, N/A beer accounted for 0.3% of the market, but over half the people in any survey I ran expressed interest in it. There was a broken feedback loop between the industry and the consumer.\n\nI set out to change that. After a decade-long hedge fund career, I founded Athletic Brewing in 2017 with our co-founder, John Walker.\n\nI was building from personal experience: I wanted this product to exist. I quit my job without ever having brewed a batch of beer. We had no prototype; just a lot of confidence that I was the future consumer.\n\nHere's a look at my typical day as the CEO of Athletic Brewing.\n\nI've always been a morning person. I really take advantage of the times of day that I can absolutely control, where there aren't any distractions.\n\nThe first thing I do when I wake up is walk our two dogs and meditate. In my head, I lay out three priorities for the day: what are the most key building blocks?\n\nWhen I get back, I write down those three goals before doing anything else — even pouring my first cup of coffee. I tend to knock them out right at the beginning of the day.\n\nBefore I became a father, I ran about 10 Spartan, or obstacle-course, races a year. I'd love to get back out there in the future.\n\nNow, I try to sweat early in the morning unless I know I have a workout planned later. If I have 10 minutes, it might be something as simple as burpees in my living room or basement, but normally it's something a little more robust, like running outdoors, jumping on a treadmill or Peloton bike, or doing a quick weights workout.\n\nIf I had more time, I would love to do a lot more trail running than I currently do — I usually have time for one six-mile run on the weekends, about one hour. It's just the current stage of life I'm in.\n\nI cook breakfast for my wife and son every day. It changes, but generally it's just healthy, simple stuff from scratch — cheesy eggs, fruit bowls, toast.\n\nIt's a really good way to spend quality time with my family — it leads to natural conversation, figuring out what's going on in everyone's day.\n\nAfter, I drop my son off at school and continue on to the brewery. Then, I'm off and running.\n\nI get a lot of my online work done late at night — outside traditional hours — so that I can be as unplugged as possible when I'm with the team.\n\nI find a lot of great collaboration happens in person; there's stuff that doesn't rise to the level of a Zoom calendar meeting, like a hallway conversation.\n\nI spend time walking around with our teammates through the brewery, seeing how things are running, trying to figure out if there are any pain points or inefficiencies in people's days. In general, Athletic Brewing is intended to be a very flat organization — without hierarchies or bureaucracy. Cross-departmental collaboration is encouraged.\n\nI'm also a big believer in getting out and talking to either retailers or distributors. I've traveled to about 30 different states per year for the last two years. I like to see our retailers and consumers on their home turf and in their own markets, tasting as much beer as I can, fresh off the draught line to make sure it's up to our standards.\n\nLunch and dinner are always beer meals.\n\nI tend to drink our Athletic Light with lunch — today's was a salad. As someone who wears a Whoop band and strives for a whole-food diet and consistency, healthy eating can feel like I'm having the same thing over and over again. But pairing lunch with a really exciting IPA — one that's not going to slow you down or get you off your health goals— changes things. Athletic has been a pretty big health unlock for me, just from the consumer side.\n\nI usually have our Run Wild IPA with dinner — it's the best to pair with food. And in the evenings, I almost always have a Free Wave Hazy IPA while I work. It's kind of my reward for the day.\n\nToward the late afternoon, I start to run out of gas and my productivity goes down.\n\nToday, my son asked me before I dropped him off if I was going to be home in time to play football in the backyard this evening. So I'll try to get home before it's too dark to do that for at least a little bit.\n\nWhen I get home, I often cook dinner. I love making all kinds of dishes, including pasta, lasagna, stir fry, cheeseburgers, steak, chicken, and a family favorite we call \"Billy's Carrots.\"\n\nI like to spend time with my family before my son goes to bed. It's a very intentional unplug; I typically leave the phone off and on the counter.\n\nSince having a child, I've become an evening person as well as a morning person to get everything done.\n\nAfter my family goes to bed, I find the next three hours are usually some of my most productive hours of the day, where I can really focus, clear my inbox, and take on two or three key projects when the world's all quiet.\n\nBefore I log off for the night, I write down the three most important tasks to accomplish the following day. If you write down three goals over and over every day, it's really hard, subconsciously, not to make progress toward them. I've been doing that for about eight years now.\n\nThis is how I find a really good balance in my life. I have a saying I share a lot with our team: going 65 miles an hour in the middle lane. It's not getting burned out, but it's extremely consistent. There are a lot of people going 100 miles an hour out there for very short bursts. And I'll be here day after day, year after year, going 65 miles an hour in the middle lane, covering a ton of ground.\n\nI don't like to go to bed thinking about the worst part of the day or stones left unturned — things I'm more privy to as my job is to find what needs improvement. So, I follow a gratitude practice where I highlight 3 to 5 things that were great that day. It helps me end the day on a positive note, taking the wins I don't naturally stop to appreciate.\n\nI learned during the stress of my finance career that I prefer to work hard, meditate, and then try to shut down. I have a stack of 12 books on my bedside table at night that I always wish I had more time to get to. I recently just finished \"1929\" by Andrew Ross Sorkin, Michael Dell's autobiography \"Play Nice But Win,\" \"The Creative Shift\" by the former CEO of BBDO, Andrew Robertson, and a murder mystery I'm forgetting the name of.\n\nHowever, my best life hack for getting a great night's sleep is \"Midsomer Murders,\" a sleepy British countryside murder mystery that's been on air for over 25 years.\n\nI think they're great. They're solvable, with small chitchat and beautiful landscapes, and it really takes me out of my life and into this quiet world. I've been watching those with my wife for about 15 years. They'll put anyone to sleep in 15 minutes.",

    "title": "Elon Musk said automakers don't want to license Tesla FSD. We're starting to see why.",
    "description": "Legacy automakers and Tesla rival Rivian have recently announced roadmaps to pursue autonomous driving technology in-house.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk has called legacy automakers' hesitancy to license Tesla's Full Self-Driving software \"crazy,\" but a slew of industry moves show that their reluctance is strategic.\n\nIn recent weeks, more automakers have released roadmaps to build key pieces of automated driving software rather than outsourcing the technology. Because automakers see vehicle tech as a brand-defining component, a Tesla license can become a hard sell.\n\nRivian, for example, is going deeper into vertical integration by designing a proprietary chip for the brain behind the company's autonomous driving computer. CEO RJ Scaringe even broached the idea of pursuing a robotaxi business at Rivian's Autonomy & AI Day in early December.\n\nLegacy automakers aren't taking the same ambitious route of designing custom chips, but they have begun to seek in-house solutions.\n\nFord announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas that it plans to develop eyes-off driving software for public roads by 2028. The company said going in-house cuts costs by 30% and provides more control over how the software is integrated and deployed.\n\n\"To integrate, I can't do this with all these suppliers,\" Paul Costa, Ford's head of electrical engineering, told Business Insider. \"We need to bring this stuff in-house, and it allows for this ability to do the trifecta at once: smaller, cheaper, and higher performance.\"\n\nMusk said in a X post in November that it was \"crazy\" that legacy automakers didn't want to license Tesla FSD, an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that the EV maker has said will enable fully autonomous driving.\n\n\"When legacy auto does occasionally reach out, they tepidly discuss implementing FSD for a tiny program in 5 years with unworkable requirements for Tesla, so pointless,\" Musk said in the post.\n\nMusk didn't specify what those requirements were. A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nExperts who track the software side of the automotive industry told Business Insider there's a practical reason to go in-house, even if there are near-term challenges.\n\nChris Ahn, a principal at Deloitte who consults for key automakers, told Business Insider that companies have to decide what level of autonomy their customer base will want and how to achieve it, like using lidar or using a cameras-only system.\n\n\"It's not so much like, 'I'm taking it in-house because I don't want to use somebody's technology.' But this is a competitive business for them,\" Ahn said. \"People who own Fords own Fords for certain reasons that are probably different reasons than why people who own Mercedes own Mercedes. And I think each of these automakers are going to have to define what does ADAS mean for the user base of my brand today.\"\n\nSteve Man, a senior auto analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, told Business Insider that the technology stack of autonomous vehicles could be thought of as three interconnected parts: the software, the sensors, and the actuators — the components that control the physical movement of the car.\n\nAll three components need to be able to \"talk\" to each other within a vehicle platform, Man said, which can be challenging and costly to do when an automaker relies on multiple suppliers.\n\n\"It's actually cheaper to bring everything in-house to integrate those three buckets of things,\" Man said.\n\nAs automakers seek more control over their technology, the tools to build autonomy are becoming more accessible. That makes a Tesla FSD license a less compelling business case.\n\nAt CES, Nvidia introduced Alpamayo, a package of AI reasoning models, simulation tools, and datasets automakers can use to develop self-driving technology.\n\nMercedes-Benz was revealed to be Nvidia's first major customer; the automaker plans to launch a Tesla FSD-level ADAS built on Alpamayo by the end of the year.\n\nAlpamayo isn't a full-stack autonomous driving software that automakers simply plug in. An Nvidia spokesperson told Business Insider it's a toolset that can \"strengthen and speed up an OEM's own ADAS or autonomy program, whether they're building end-to-end systems or upgrading existing architectures.\"\n\nAutomakers still need proprietary data and talent to implement and develop their autonomous systems.\n\nHugh Nguyen, a KPMG partner who specializes in autonomous driving systems, told Business Insider that Alpamayo \"democratizes\" AV development by reducing the cost and time for training self-driving systems.\n\nDuring a Q&A session at CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called Tesla FSD \"completely world-class,\" before drawing a distinction between Tesla's goals and Nvidia's.\n\n\"We're not a self-driving car company,\" he said. \"We just want to enable the world's autonomous industry. Everything that moves should be autonomous.\"",

    "title": "I owe you an apology, small cap stocks. I wasn't really familiar with your game.",
    "description": "The markets smallest stocks have been trouncing their bigger peers for the first time in years. Could it be the start of something bigger?",
    "fullText": "It's directed at small-cap stocks, which populate the recently unloved tier of companies with market caps between $250 million and $2 billion.\n\nI'm here to say I'm sorry that I overlooked them for so long, opting to breathlessly cover Magnificent 7 mega-cap stocks like Nvidia, Tesla, and Alphabet as they reached new trillion-dollar heights.\n\nFast forward to the start of 2026, and small caps are making me eat crow for ignoring them.\n\nThe Russell 2000 index is up 8% this year, multiple times the S&P 500's 1.4% return. It also outperformed the S&P for an 12th straight day on Monday, the longest such streak since 2008.\n\nIt's a stark shift from the previous two years. It's not that small caps did poorly, per se, it's just that they lagged their bigger peers. Since the start of 2024, through the end of last year, the S&P 500's 44% return was nearly double the gain for the Russell 2000.\n\nSo why, for the first time in a while, does David have the upper hand on Goliath? For a few reasons:\n\nPut in the simplest terms, small caps are cheaper than their bigger counterparts at current levels. This should come as no surprise to anyone who's heard the seemingly endless cries of a bubble forming in AI.\n\nThere's no denying that the S&P 500 is full of fantastically profitable companies. But the index sits at records, priced to perfection. Investors are naturally looking for a better deal.\n\nSometimes inexpensive stocks are cheap for a reason, and can be a trap for value-hunting investors. There still has to be a compelling fundamental reason to buy something.\n\nLuckily, for small caps, that comes in the form of an overwhelmingly bullish economic outlook from firms on Wall Street. (Small caps have historically lived and died with the economy.) As the most bullish bank on the block, Morgan Stanley is one firm pinning hopes on economic expansion generating strong earnings growth — especially for small caps — in the first half of 2026.\n\nSmall caps are one of the most rate-sensitive areas of the stock market. Rate cuts = good. Rate hikes = bad. Well, investors are currently pricing in two more cuts in 2026, which seems to be enough for small-cap bulls at the moment.\n\nSo can small caps keep it up? One stat compiled by Bloomberg would seem to suggest yes. Going back to 1979, the Russell 2000 has outperformed the S&P 500 in January by more than 500 basis points on five occasions. All but one of those times, the Russell index finished the full year on top.\n\nI'll keep an eye on it. And if small caps do keep dominating, I pledge to give them as much love as the big guys.",

CMAF improves efficiency and scalability for HTTP-based streaming, but it cannot match the real-time performance of technologies like WebRTC. This article explains where CMAF came from, how it works, how it compares to HLS, WebRTC, DASH, and fMP4, and how to decide whether CMAF is the right choice for your project.\n\nCMAF, or Common Media Application Format, is an open standard for packaging video, audio, and text for adaptive HTTP streaming. It defines a common media container that can be used across modern streaming workflows, helping simplify distribution while improving efficiency.\n\nRather than introducing a new delivery protocol, CMAF focuses on how media is encoded and segmented so it can be reused across different playback environments. This makes it easier to manage assets, reduce operational overhead, and support scalable streaming on a wide range of devices.\n\nCMAF is widely adopted across the streaming industry and serves as a foundation for low-latency HTTP streaming when combined with compatible delivery modes and player support.\n\nOriginally, the HTTP based streaming protocols HLS and MPEG-DASH were (and continue to be) the most widely used methods to distribute live streaming media. Delivering an HTTP stream involves dividing the video into small chunks that reside on an HTTP server. In this way, the individual video chunks can be downloaded by a video player via TCP. This allows the video to traverse firewalls easily, where it can be delivered as it is watched, thus minimizing caching.\n\nHowever, there is a drawback involving the encoding of audio and video data. HLS traditionally uses TS containers to hold the muxed a/v data, while DASH prefers the ISO-Base Media File Format holding demuxed tracks.\n\nIn order to connect with a variety of devices, content owners must package and store two sets of files, each holding exactly the same audio and video data. This creates an issue for Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) using their HTTP networks to deliver streaming content as it doubles storage costs and bottlenecks bandwidth throughput with redundant processing.\n\nThe creation of the CMAF came out of efforts to solve this redundancy problem. Created in 2017 by a joint effort between Microsoft and Apple, CMAF is a standardized container designed to hold video, audio, or text data that is deployed using HTTP based streaming protocols: HLS or MPEG-DASH.\n\nBitmovin provides the following definition:\n\nCMAF defines the encoding and packaging of segmented media objects for delivery and decoding on end-user devices in adaptive multimedia presentations. In particular, this is (i) storage, (ii) identification, and (iii) delivery of encoded media objects with various constraints on encoding and packaging. That means CMAF defines not only the segment format but also codecs and most importantly media profiles (i.e., for AVC, HEVC, AAC).\n\nThe advantage of CMAF is that media segments can be referenced simultaneously by HLS playlists and DASH manifests. This allows CDNs to store only one set of files which in turn doubles the cache hit rate making the process more efficient.\n\nCMAF defines how media is encoded, segmented, and packaged so it can be delivered and decoded consistently across adaptive streaming systems. Content is organized into CMAF Presentations, which contain time-aligned Switching Sets made up of one or more Tracks encoded at different bitrates, resolutions, or qualities. These aligned fragments allow players to switch between variants seamlessly during playback without disrupting audio or video continuity.\n\nCMAF media is delivered as addressable objects such as Fragments, Segments, and Chunks, but CMAF itself does not mandate a specific manifest format or delivery protocol. This separation allows the same encoded media to be used with different playback systems while maintaining consistent decoding behavior.\n\nFor low-latency use cases, CMAF supports chunk-based delivery, where fragments are divided into smaller chunks that can be encoded, delivered, and decoded incrementally before a full segment is complete. This enables just-in-time playback while remaining compatible with standard HTTP delivery and CDN workflows.\n\nCMAF Fragment Structure, Packaged in CMAF Chunks for Low Latency Delivery. Source\n\nIn actuality, CMAF containers are not able to reduce latency by themselves. Instead, a low latency mode (known as Low Latency CMAF, or Chunked CMAF) must be configured.\n\nIf you can’t tell by now, this is the really technical part so feel free to skip ahead if so inclined.\n\nChunked CMAF divides each container into smaller sections. Listing them from biggest to smallest: CMAF Container > Segment > Fragment > Chunk. Each chunk is defined as the smallest referenceable unit that contains at least a moof and mdat atom. One or more chunks are combined together to form a fragment which in turn can be merged into a segment.\n\nIn order to transmit each CMAF Segment, a POST request containing a CMAF Header is sent to the ingest origin server. Immediately after each CMAF Chunk completes encoding and packaging, it is sent through HTTP 1.1 chunked transfer encoding. This means that each segment can be progressively delivered as each chunk is ready rather than waiting for the entire segment to load before it can be sent out.\n\nAs an example, if the encoder is producing 4-second segments with 30 frames per second then it would make a POST request to the origin every 4 seconds and each of the 120 frames would be sent using chunked transfer encoding.\n\nThen, the chunks ingested into the origin are delivered over HTTP chunked transfer encoding to a CDN where Edge servers make them available to the players which will eventually display the media. In order to retrieve the segment, the player uses the manifest or playlist associated with a stream to establish a connection with the correct Edge and then it makes a GET request.\n\nLaboratory tests with CMAF have achieved end-to-end latencies as low as 600ms. However, results in the real world, away from the lab’s controlled environment, are less impressive. Current proof-of-concepts deployed over the open internet have shown a sustainable Quality of Experience (QoE) only when the end-to-end latency is around 3 seconds.\n\nThis increase is due in part to the fact that it requires many small chunks of 250 milliseconds. This would add to the number of HTTP calls happening (at least four per second), create higher bandwidth video, and increase server load; all of which add latency.\n\nIt should also be noted that CMAF creates problems for consistent stream quality, specifically in regards to adaptive bitrate, because of the way current algorithms estimate throughput.\n\nDefinitely not. While CMAF shows improved latency over vanilla HLS and DASH, it is still not low enough to enable fully interactive live video experiences.\n\nAs we’ve mentioned before, you can only have real-time streaming if the latency is under 500 milliseconds. In today’s world of instant communication and information, every second (and partial second) counts. Drone surveillance, social media chatting, live auctions, broadcasting live events among many other use-cases, all require real-time latency.\n\nThe decision ultimately comes down to compatibility versus efficiency. Choose HLS if you need the broadest possible device support and highly reliable delivery across existing platforms. Choose CMAF if you want to standardize your media format, reduce duplicate encodes, and enable lower-latency HTTP streaming without abandoning HLS delivery. CMAF works alongside HLS, improving how media is packaged while HLS continues to handle distribution and playback.\n\nIn practice, the choice comes down to scale versus immediacy. CMAF excels at delivering the same high-quality stream to massive audiences efficiently. WebRTC excels at keeping participants synchronized in real time, enabling interaction that buffered streaming protocols cannot support.\n\nIf you want a deeper technical breakdown of latency, scalability, infrastructure requirements, and real-world use cases, read our CMAF vs WebRTC comparison blog.\n\nThe distinction here centers on packaging versus delivery. Choose MPEG-DASH if you need a flexible, standards-based streaming protocol with broad support across platforms and devices. Choose CMAF if you want a single, standardized media format that can be reused across DASH and other HTTP streaming workflows to reduce complexity and storage overhead. CMAF complements DASH by defining how media is packaged, while DASH focuses on how that media is described, delivered, and played back.\n\nThe difference here lies between a file format and a complete packaging standard. Choose fragmented MP4 if you simply need a container format for segmented media. Choose CMAF if you need a standardized way to package fMP4 with defined constraints that enable interoperability, adaptive switching, and low-latency streaming. CMAF builds on fMP4 by adding rules and profiles that make fragmented media work consistently across streaming platforms and players.\n\nWhen asked what is CMAF, the short answer is that it simplifies how streaming media is packaged and delivered at scale. It improves efficiency and latency compared to traditional HTTP streaming, but it is not intended for fully interactive real-time experiences.\n\n🔥 Looking for a fully managed, globally distributed streaming PaaS solution? Start using Red5 Cloud today!

    "fullText": "A post that is going to be part of my sequence on rethinking programming languages.\n\nA compiler is a piece of machine code , that takes as input a text string describing a program  and returns the compiled machine code\n\nLet  be a function that takes in a machine code program and returns another potentially faster or smaller program.\n\nA metacompliler has the formula\n\nTo understand how this works, first let's look at a less self referential case. Let  be a regular compiler.\n\nis just a string. Maybe it's \"print(1+2)\"\n\nis a machine code program. This program, if run, would first compile  into machine code, and then would run that machine code. Therefore it is a machine code program that does the same thing as . It has a fairly significant size for even a small program, as it contains a complete copy of the compiler.\n\nWhat does  do? It optimizes that machine code. The first thing it can do is cut out big chunks of the compiler. At least in simple cases. If the code is running arbitrary eval statements, all the compiler might be needed. In the case of this simple program, the parts of the compiler that handle floats, loops etc are just not used. If the optimizer is good, it could simplify the code all the way down to . Some programming languages (see zig) already run code at compile time. The difference between compile and run time is just in what variables you currently know the value of, and the relative cost of compute.\n\nFor code with a finite runtime that just runs by itself, not interacting with the outside world, it can all, in principle be simplified down to a single print statement. In practice computer programs interact with the \"outside world\" in all sorts of ways. In some contexts, writes to disk or sending data to a GPU might be considered interactions with an external world. But for simplicity, assume the only form of interaction is input() and print()\n\nSo that's what a metacompiler does. But does it actually do anything. The most naive metacompiler implimentation has  .  When we call  we get the program. And when we proceed to run that program, that program first calls  to generate the machine code  and then runs that machine code. This leads to an infinite regress. We haven't actually used  anywhere. What we essentially have is just.\n\nA program that is clearly an infinite loop, with no actual relation to pi.\n\nSo we need the optimization step of the metacompiler to be doing something non-trivial to make the code halt in a finite time at all.\n\nLets define a small toy programming language, so we can talk about how to compile it.\n\nWe will give our programming language one data type, arbitrary size integers.\n\nWe will allow definitions, inputs, calculations and loops.\n\nThis example program shows all the features of this programming language. It is rather minimal.\n\nThe only free parameter in the metacompiler (as above) is in the choice of\n\nFor clarity, machine code instructions will look the same as programming language instructions, except the machine code will be in BOLD\n\nThe program consists of a number of definitions,  (of the format [name]=[number], looking like  ) followed by the first non-definition statement. If the same name is used multiple times, only the last definition is needed. Ie the code  can be optimized to\n\nSuppose the optimizer takes in  code where the first non-definition in  happens to be a calculation. For example.  this can get optimized into\n\nNow suppose the first non-definition in  is an .  For example.  This can be converted into.\n\nThe way to think about this is that, if  were a normal compiler, the  function would convert a machine code program containing  into another machine code program that still contains  but that makes  do slightly less work.\n\nwhile the similar  can simplify down to\n\nThis gives a functioning toy example of a metacompiler. The above simplification rules are used in the definition of , which is in turn used in the definition of .\n\nThis produces code that, while excessively self referential, runs and produces output in a finite time, at least assuming the output of a regular compiler would run in finite time on the program.\n\nNote that  only does 1 simplification step, and is only run once at compile time.\n\nSuppose we insisted that, before  is allowed to simplify a piece of machine code, it must first prove that it's simplification won't change the result. This can be proved, by lob's theorem. However it isn't sufficient to make the metacompiler actually valid. Lob's theorem just says that ZFC approves of infinite buck passing. At some point we need to actually understand our programming language.\n\nIf however we make  prove that  is equivalent to  before  is allowed to output . Then that is sufficient. Your directly proving that your meta-compiler is doing the same thing as a regular compiler, which gives you a ground truth about the meaning of the programming language.\n\nWhile the example meta-compiler given above isn't particularly fast, the toy example shows that metacompilers can exist. And the space of meta-compilers seems like it should contain all sorts of interesting optimizations.\n\nFor example. I was doing some programming involving numerically integrating systems of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE's). Basically, I choose various settings and then run a tight loop involving those settings. And ideally I would like the speed of special purpose compiled code within the tight loop, without having the overhead of a full compilation from source every time I change a setting.\n\nSo, what I would ideally want is a program that contains precompiled snippets of code. Once the particular values of the settings are known, a highly optimized machine code program could be put together by little more than pasting together the relevant blocks of machine code to make a complete machine code program.\n\nAnd I'm wanting a way to make the programming language do this, or other clever things like this, automagically.\n\nAnother clever thing. Suppose your program contains  of arbitrary user generated strings. But you know this is only a small fraction of runtime. And the user isn't allowed to use various language features. You might want to make a cut down minified version of the full language compiler, something with the unused features cut out, and some of the optimization tricks removed.\n\nThe hope is to totally blur the line between compile time and runtime, with code that can rewrite itself on the fly in all sorts of clever and highly performant ways.",

    "fullText": "Government, Bank of England and FCA criticised for taking ‘wait-and-see’ approach to AI use in financial sector\n\nConsumers and the UK financial system are being exposed to “serious harm” by the failure of government and the Bank of England to get a grip on the risks posed by artificial intelligence, an influential parliamentary committee has warned.\n\nIn a new report, MPs on the Treasury committee criticise ministers and City regulators, including the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), for taking a “wait-and-see” approach to AI use across the financial sector.\n\nThat is despite looming concerns over how the burgeoning technology could disadvantage already vulnerable consumers, or even trigger a financial crisis, if AI-led firms end up making similar financial decisions in response to economic shocks.\n\nMore than 75% of City firms now use AI, with insurers and international banks among the biggest adopters. It is being used to automate administrative tasks or even help with core operations, including processing insurance claims and assessing customers’ credit-worthiness.\n\nBut the UK has failed to develop any specific laws or regulations to govern their use of AI, with the FCA and Bank of England claiming general rules are sufficient to ensure positive outcomes for consumers. That means businesses have to determine how existing guidelines apply to AI, leaving MPs worried this could put consumers and financial stability at risk.\n\n“It is the responsibility of the Bank of England, the FCA and the government to ensure the safety mechanisms within the system keeps pace,” said Meg Hillier, chair of the Treasury committee. “Based on the evidence I’ve seen, I do not feel confident that our financial system is prepared if there was a major AI-related incident and that is worrying.”\n\nThe report flagged a lack of transparency around how AI could influence financial decisions, potentially affecting vulnerable consumers’ access to loans or insurance. It said it was also unclear whether data providers, tech developers or financial firms would be held responsible when things went wrong.\n\nMPs said AI also increased the likelihood of fraud, and the dissemination of unregulated and misleading financial advice.\n\nIn terms of financial stability, MPs found that rising AI use increased firms’ cybersecurity risks, and left them overly reliant on a small number of US tech companies, such as Google, for essential services. Its uptake could also amplify “herd behaviour”, with businesses making similar financial decisions during economic shocks and “risking a financial crisis”.\n\nThe Treasury committee is now urging regulators to take action, including the launch of new stress tests that would assess the City’s readiness for AI-driven market shocks. MPs also want the FCA to publish “practical guidance” by the end of the year, clarifying how consumer protection rules apply to AI use, and who would be held accountable if consumers suffer any harm.\n\n“By taking a wait-and-see approach to AI in financial services, the three authorities are exposing consumers and the financial system to potentially serious harm”, the report said.\n\nThe FCA said it had already “undertaken extensive work to ensure firms are able to use AI in a safe and responsible way”, but would review the report’s findings “carefully”.\n\nA spokesperson for the Treasury said: “We’ve been clear that we will strike the right balance between managing the risks posed by AI and unlocking its huge potential.”\n\nThey added that this involved working with regulators to “strengthen our approach as the technology evolves”, and appointing new “AI champions” covering financial services “to ensure we seize the opportunities it presents in a safe and responsible way”.\n\nA spokesperson for the Bank of England said it had “already taken active steps to assess AI-related risks and reinforce the resilience of the financial system, including publishing a detailed risk assessment and highlighting the potential implications of a sharp fall in AI-affected asset prices. We will consider the committee’s recommendations carefully and will respond in full in due course.”",

A Sunday morning update said the state worker was “experiencing some soreness.”\n\nNursultan Rysbekov, 29, of Mount Prospect, Illinois, was arrested for DUI and for allegedly endangering a roadway worker, said the Washington State Patrol.\n\nThe crash happened shortly before 8 p.m. Saturday in Kittitas County, about six miles east of Ellensburg.\n\nRysbekov was driving east in a Freightliner truck and trailer when he hit the snowplow working in the eastbound lanes, said the WSP. The collision caused the snowplow to careen into the median and flip.\n\nBoth men were wearing seat belts, said WSP investigators.\n\n“While we’re grateful to hear our driver is ok, what happened last night is inexcusable,” WSDOT posted on Facebook on Sunday.\n\n“When our plows are actively treating the roads, they must drive slower than normal to apply product effectively and evenly. Driving slower prevents scatter of material and keeps more of it on the roadway,” said the post.\n\n“Make smart decisions before you get behind the wheel. Do not drive impaired. Do not crowd or pass our plows while they’re working,” said the post.\n\n“We want all of our equipment to be available when a snowstorm comes, but – more importantly – we want everyone to get home safely at the end of the day.”",

I was like, God, please help me, I didn't do anything wrong. Why do they do this to me? Without my clothes on,\" Thao, a Hmong man ‌born in Laos, told Reuters from his home on Monday, while neighbors were at work fixing the broken door.\n\nPictures of the incident showing Thao barely clothed and covered in a blanket taken by a Reuters photographer and bystanders spread on social media, further fueling concern that federal law enforcement officers were exceeding their authority as part of U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, which has seen some 3,000 officers deployed in the Minneapolis area.\n\nA statement published by the family called the incident \"unnecessary, degrading, ⁠and deeply traumatizing.\" The highest temperature in Saint Paul ‌on Sunday was 14 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 10 degrees Celsius).\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said officers were investigating two convicted sex offenders at the address and that a U.S. citizen living there refused to be fingerprinted or facially identified, so he was ‍detained.\n\n\"He matched the description of the targets. As with any law enforcement agency, it is standard protocol to hold all individuals in a house of an operation for safety of the public and law enforcement,\" DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.\n\nDHS published wanted posters for two men targeted in the investigation who were ​still at large, describing each as a \"criminal illegal alien\" from Laos who is subject to deportation orders. One of the men in the wanted posters ‌previously lived at the house but moved out, according to relatives close to the situation, who described him as the ex-husband of a member of the Thao family.\n\nA U.S. District Judge in Minnesota on Friday issued an injunction blocking the Trump administration from some aggressive tactics that she said would \"chill\" an ordinary citizen from engaging in constitutionally protected protest.\n\n\"That conduct includes the drawing and pointing of weapons; the use of pepper spray and other non-lethal munitions; actual and threatened arrest and detainment of protesters and observers; and other intimidation tactics,\" Judge Katherine Menendez wrote.\n\nThe Trump administration is appealing her injunction.\n\nThao said his parents brought him ⁠from Laos to the United States in 1974 when he was four-years-old and that he ​became a U.S. citizen in 1991. During the ordeal, he feared being sent back to Laos, ​where he has no relatives.\n\nHe said he was singing karaoke when there was a loud noise at the door. He and his family hid in a bedroom, where the federal officers found him. Thao said that he was trying to find his ID ‍as officers escorted him out of ⁠the house.\n\nThao was wearing only boxer shorts and Crocs on his feet when officers denied him the chance to put on more clothes, he said. He used a blanket that his four-year-old grandson had been sleeping with on the couch to cover his torso.\n\nAfter taking his fingerprints and ⁠a head shot in the car, officers returned him to his home, Thao said.\n\n\"We came here for a purpose, right? ... To have a bright future. To have a safe place to ‌live,\" he said. \"If this is going to turn out to be America, what are we doing here? Why are we here?\"",

    "description": "Two successfull hedge fund managers sold Amazon and bought a spot Bitcoin ETF in the third quarter.",
    "fullText": "In the third quarter, hedge fund billionaires Philippe Laffont and Steven Schonfeld sold Amazon stock and added to their positions in the iShares Bitcoin Trust.\n\nWall Street expects Amazon’s earnings to grow at 19% annually over the next three years, which makes the current valuation of 34 times earnings look fair.\n\nMore companies and institutional investors are buying Bitcoin (or spot Bitcoin ETFs), and that is likely to continue because it is the more popular and most liquid cryptocurrency.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nIn the third quarter, two hedge fund billionaires sold Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and added to positions in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) managed by BlackRock that tracks the spot price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC).\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management sold 1.4 million shares of Amazon, trimming the position 14%. He also purchased 76,100 shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, more than doubling his stake.\n\nSteven Schonfeld of Schonfeld Strategic Advisors sold 253,700 shares of Amazon, reducing the position 72%. He also added 1.1 million shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust, increasing his stake 20%.\n\nThe trades are noteworthy because Laffont and Schonfeld outperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) by 94 percentage points and 22 percentage points, respectively, in the last three years. That makes both hedge fund managers good sources of inspiration.\n\nSeveral Wall Street analysts expect Bitcoin to be far more valuable in the future. Tom Lee at Fundstrat Global Advisors says its price could hit $3 trillion in the long run, which implies more than 3,000% upside from where it currently trades at $95,000. Michael Saylor of Strategy says its price could hit $13 million by 2045, implying more than 13,500% upside.\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nAmazon has a strong presence in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing.

    "fullText": "Jan 20 (Reuters) - Ugandan military chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba said he was praying for fugitive opposition leader Bobi Wine's death and gave him 48 hours to surrender ​to the police following a contentious presidential election.\n\nFormer pop star Wine said he ‌fled a military raid on his house hours before veteran President Yoweri Museveni was declared the landslide winner of ‌last week's presidential election.\n\nWine, who finished runner-up, has alleged widespread fraud during the vote. He has released several statements since Saturday from undisclosed locations.\n\nKainerugaba, who is Museveni's son and is widely believed to be his preferred successor, made a series of threats against Wine in posts late ⁠on Monday on X, referring to ‌him by the derisive nickname \"Kabobi\".\n\n\"I am giving him exactly 48 hours to surrender himself to the Police,\" Kainerugaba wrote. \"If he doesn't we ‍will treat him as an outlaw/rebel and handle him accordingly.\"\n\nIn another post, Kainerugaba said in a reference to Wine's National Unity Platform party: \"We have killed 22 NUP terrorists since last week. I'm praying the 23rd ​is Kabobi.\"\n\nPolice spokesperson Kituma Rusoke said on Monday night that Wine was not being ‌sought.\n\nAfter a tense campaign in which security forces repeatedly opened fire at Wine's rallies, several incidents of post-election violence were reported. In one, the police killed several opposition supporters in central Uganda in disputed circumstances.\n\nHowever, fears of the kind of violence that killed hundreds - and possibly thousands - in neighbouring Tanzania after its elections in October did not materialise.\n\nHISTORY OF INFLAMMATORY SOCIAL ⁠MEDIA POSTS\n\nKainerugaba, 51, routinely makes inflammatory posts on social ​media, including a threat in 2022 to invade neighbouring ​Kenya.\n\nLast year he boasted he had Wine's bodyguard in his basement and threatened to castrate him. The bodyguard was later charged with robbery.\n\nKainerugaba has spoken ‍openly about his desire ⁠to take over from his father, who has been in power since 1986. Museveni, 81, has denied grooming his son to succeed him.\n\nAt least 118 NUP members ⁠were charged in court on Monday with election-related offences, including unlawful assembly and conspiracy, court documents showed.\n\nDavid Rubongoya, the ‌NUP's secretary general, denied party members were involved in violent activity.",

    "fullText": "(This Jan 17 story has been repeated with no changes to text)\n\nNEW YORK, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has asked a New ​York federal judge to deny a request by two lawmakers seeking an appointment ‌of a special master to monitor the public release of records tied to the late financier and ‌convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe Justice Department since December has been releasing caches of documents tied to its investigations of Epstein. But U.S. Representatives Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie have criticized the department's slow pace.\n\nKhanna, a California Democrat, and Massie, a Kentucky Republican, last week ⁠said they asked U.S. District ‌Judge Paul Engelmayer to permit them to file a brief that would argue for the appointment of a special master and independent ‍monitor, given the Justice Department's failure to fully comply with a law that requires the DOJ to release all records related to Epstein by December 19.\n\nIn a six-page letter filed on Friday ​to U.S. District Court Judge Paul Engelmayer on Friday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi ‌and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche argued that Khanna and Thomas Massie are not parties to the U.S. v. Ghislaine Maxwell case involving Epstein and should not be allowed to file a friend of the court request in the matter.\n\n\"Representatives Khanna and Massie do not have standing, their stated objectives are in-consistent with the role of an amicus ⁠as well as the role of the Court, ​and, in any event, there is no authority ​permitting the Court to grant the Representatives the relief they improperly seek,\" the DOJ said in the letter signed by Jay Clayton, US attorney ‍for the Southern District ⁠of New York.\n\nMaxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls.\n\nThe Justice Department said at the end of 2025 that it had ⁠5.2 million pages of Epstein files left to review and needs 400 lawyers from four different department ‌offices to help with the process through late January.",

    "description": "\"A rapidly changing landscape.\"",
    "fullText": "An abundance of venomous snakes near and within the capital city of Dhaka in Bangladesh has alarmed officials in recent months, raising concerns that rapid urbanization may be driving the reptiles from their natural habitats.\n\nAccording to the environmental news outlet Mongabay, government officials and groups such as the Bangladesh Animal Welfare Association rescued hundreds of snakes in and around Dhaka in 2025.\n\nAt least 351 were captured in \"densely populated\" areas between January and November 1. Mongabay reported that 319 were venomous.\n\nThe association's Adnan Azad told the Daily Bangladesh Tribune that some snakes have been found as high as the ninth floor of some buildings. Once caught, experts return the animals to nature.\n\nExperts like Md Sohel Rana, a herpetologist with the Bangladesh Forest Department's Wildlife Centre, are concerned that habitat loss due to human activity is the primary driver of burgeoning snake populations in residential areas.\n\n\"Reduced water bodies, deforestation, industrialization, urbanization, and destruction of snake habitats by humans are the reasons for finding snakes in urban homesteads,\" Rana told Mongabay, noting that habitat loss is also impacting snakes' food sources.\n\n\"Due to a rapidly changing landscape, most of the wildlife have lost their habitats,\" Rana continued. \"As a result, they frequently sneak into human settlements in search of food and shelter.\"\n\nA study by the Change Initiative found that the city of Dhaka lost more than 60% of its water bodies between 1980 and 2024. The Padma cobra is among the snake species that prefer watery environments, like rivers and ponds, zoologist Farid Ahsan told the Daily Bangladesh Tribune. The Change Initiative also found that around 56% of the area's grass and agricultural lands had also been lost.\n\nThese losses also pose risks to city dwellers. Among the 89 snake species native to Bangladesh, around 30% are venomous, according to a study cited by Mongabay. An uptick in snakes driven from natural habitats into populated areas could increase the risk of harmful snake bites.\n\nIn his conversation with Mongabay, Rana noted that social media has raised awareness of snake rescues in the city and spread information on how to safely approach snakes.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThese animals generally won't attack unless they feel threatened, but tense human-wildlife encounters aren't necessarily unlikely in a densely packed city. The more people are aware that snakes may be lurking around the corner, the better for all parties.\n\nRaising awareness not only of potentially dangerous human-wildlife encounters but also of the causes that can contribute to them is key to effective action. Shoring up support for the protection of natural habitats by conserving and restoring large swaths of land can help provide wild animals with the space and resources they need to survive — far from busy residential communities.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "HUDSONVILLE, Mich. (AP) — More than 100 vehicles smashed into each other or slid off an interstate in Michigan on Monday as snow fueled by the Great Lakes blanketed the state.\n\nThe massive pileup prompted the Michigan State Police to close both directions of Interstate 196 Monday morning just southwest of Grand Rapids while officials worked to remove all the vehicles, including more than 30 semitrailer trucks. The State Police said there were numerous injuries, but no deaths had been reported.\n\nPedro Mata Jr. said he could barely see the cars in front of him as the snow blew across the road while driving 20-25 mph (32-40 kph) before the crash. He was able to stop his pickup safely, but then decided to pull his truck off the road into the median to avoid being hit from behind.\n\n“It was a little scary just listening to everything, the bangs and booms behind you. I saw what was in front of me. I couldn’t see what was behind me exactly,” Mata said.\n\nThe crash is just the latest impact of the major winter storm moving across the country. The National Weather Service issued warnings about either extremely cold temperatures or the potential for winter storms across several states starting in northern Minnesota and stretching south and east into Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York.\n\nA day earlier, snow fell as far south as the Florida Panhandle and made it harder for football players to hang onto the ball during playoff games in Massachusetts and Chicago. Forecasters warned Monday that freezing temperatures are possible overnight into Tuesday across much of north-central Florida and southeast Georgia.\n\nThe Ottawa County Sheriff's office in Michigan said multiple crashes and jack-knifed semis were reported along with numerous cars that slid off the road. Stranded motorists were being bused to Hudsonville High School, where they could call for help or arrange a ride.\n\nOfficials expected the road to be closed for several hours during the cleanup.\n\nOne of the companies helping remove the stranded cars, Grand Valley Towing, sent more than a dozen of its trucks to the scene of the chain-reaction crash. Several towing companies responded in the brutally cold weather.\n\n“We’re trying to get as many vehicles out of there as quickly as possible, so we can get the road opened back up,” manager Jeff Westveld said.",

    "fullText": "Not too long ago, Manchester United fans were fearing the worst when it came to Kobbie Mainoo.\n\nWith Ruben Amorim not handing him a single start in the Premier League, it looked certain that the Carrington wonderkid would be jumping ship in January.\n\nINEOS had blocked his loan demand in the summer, but the 20-year-old was now contemplating a permanent transfer away from his boyhood club.\n\nAll that has changed in the past 10 days. The Portuguese tactician got himself sacked, and with Michael Carrick now at the helm, the Englishman’s fortunes have shifted as well.\n\nHe earned his first league start of the campaign in the Manchester derby, and he put on a show against Pep Guardiola’s side.\n\nThe caretaker head coach has managed to fire up the Carrington graduate, who is in a far better place mentally as compared to a couple of weeks ago.\n\nThe midfield wonderkid is excited again, and is looking forward to earning more minutes under the legendary midfielder, who is more inclined towards handing opportunities to academy products.\n\nAnd as revealed by Teamtalk, the England international is not looking to jump ship any longer and as a result, exit talks with potential suitors like Napoli and Chelsea have been paused.\n\n“Kobbie Mainoo’s immediate future looks to be at Manchester United, with sources indicating the young midfielder is content to stay at Old Trafford provided he continues to receive regular playing time under interim manager Michael Carrick.\n\n“One of Carrick’s early priorities was to personally assure Mainoo of his importance to the team’s plans. Sources close to the situation reveal that the former United midfielder made it clear he views the England international as a central figure in his vision for the club.\n\n“Sources say Mainoo is excited by the fresh opportunities now available to him. Having been starved of consistent starts previously, the chance to play regularly under Carrick has changed his outlook.\n\n“Exit discussions that had gained traction earlier in the month have been paused by sources, with Carrick’s assurances proving pivotal in convincing the youngster to stay and fight for his place.”\n\nKobbie Mainoo cannot afford to relax. He must keep up the same level of performance against Arsenal next weekend as the Red Devils look to climb up the table.\n\nFeature image Jan Kruger via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "As the San Francisco 49ers pivot into the offseason following a Divisional Round exit from the NFL playoffs, one of the first items added to the checklist will be finding a new defensive coordinator. Highly sought-after DC Robert Saleh is once again on the move, this time leaving San Francisco to become the head coach of the Tennessee Titans, as first reported by ESPN's Adam Schefter. Saleh previously departed the 49ers to take the head coaching job with the New York Jets before returning to the Niners for a second stint as defensive coordinator, and now he’s set to take over in Tennessee.\n\nIt’s a strong landing spot for Saleh. The Titans have their quarterback of the future in Cam Ward, the most recent No. 1 overall pick, and Saleh will play a significant role in his development while helping build out the roster around him. Tennessee also enters the offseason with more than $100 million in cap space, the No. 4 overall pick in the upcoming draft, and plans to open a new stadium in 2027.\n\nAnother key factor in Saleh’s decision is that he will continue calling defensive plays as a head coach, something he did not do during his first stint leading the Jets and a reportedly important point for him this time around.\n\nFor San Francisco, the departure means replacing one of the league’s best defensive coordinators yet again. The timing isn’t ideal, as head coaching and coordinator openings across the league have been in motion for weeks, leaving the 49ers somewhat behind the curve in the interview process.\n\nStill, finding Saleh’s successor will be one of the most critical moves of the offseason as the organization balances retooling the roster with maintaining its defensive identity. It’s a significant development for both franchises, with ripple effects that will shape their respective paths heading into the 2026 season.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nRobert Saleh has found his way back to the helm of an NFL team.\n\nThe Tennessee Titans announced they are signing the 49ers' defensive coordinator as their new head coach. Saleh will follow up Brian Callahan, who was fired midway through the 2025 season.\n\nThe Titans are getting a great defensive mind who has experience as a head coach with the New York Jets. Here's a look at his track record leading a franchise.\n\nRobert Saleh has 20 wins and 36 losses as a head coach of the New York Jets from 2021 to 2024. His best seasons were 2022 and 2023 when he led the team to a pair of 7-10 records.\n\nEach of his best years, Saleh's defenses were top four in yards per game. He was fired after going 2-3 to start the 2024 season.\n\nSaleh has seen success in both tenures as the San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator. He has multiple playoff appearances, an NFC Championship, and a proven track record of getting the most out of his players.\n\nHe'll take over a Titans' defense that ranked 21st in yards allowed per game (345.1). Tennessee is also the home of former No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward. Saleh will need a strong offensive coordinator to develop the young arm.\n\nMORE:The incredible stat behind Caleb Williams' game-tying touchdown pass vs. Rams\n\nSaleh's story has yet to be written. He's been a head coach of a team known for failing regardless of leadership. He's been a great coordinator on a team known for great defensive coordinators.\n\nThis next step with Tennessee could define his career.\n\nMORE:Titans' Cam Ward can add John Harbaugh to his list of doubters",

    "fullText": "A heartbreaking end to an incredible season for Miami, but the happy conclusion to Indiana’s storybook season, the Canes fell short, losing the National Championship Game 27-21.\n\nEarly on, Indiana had all the momentum. After an early field goal, Indiana extended their lead to 10-0 on a 1-yard touchdown run by H-Back/Fullback Riley Nowakowski.\n\nWhile Indiana was scoring, Miami was doing precious little with the ball when they had it. Miami would struggle to get anything going offensively, going 3 and out on 3 consecutive drives — and those came after a quick 5 play drive to start the game — and posted an all-time CFP low 18 yards in the first quarter. Total.\n\nAfter falling behind 10-0, Miami would work their way down the field for a FG attempt late in the 2nd quarter. Carter Davis would doink it off the right upright, however, and Miami was scoreless through a half.\n\nThings picked up some after the break, however. Miami’s pass rush continued to harass Indiana star QB Fernando Mendoza, sacking him 5 times. A couple of those were turned into 0 yard rushes, but regardless, Miami got off the field defensively, but needed the offense do show signs of life.\n\nThey did just that on the 1st drive of the second half.\n\nAfter a short pass on the first play of the drive, RB Mark Fletcher Jr. burst through the right side of the line and raced 57 yards untouched to the endzone. With the score 10-7, Miami had life and were in the ball game again.\n\nIndiana was up to the challenge, and continued to keep Miami at arms length. The teams traded punts on 2 possessions and then the dam broke. Facing 4th down and a punt situation, Miami whiffed a block, and Indiana blocked the punt and recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchdown, giving the Hoosiers a 17-7 lead. That was a truly massive mistake, and the Canes were reeling in the aftermath.\n\nBut, in typical fashion for this team, they would not quit. Miami went down the field with a 10 play, 81 yard touchdown drive, capped off by Fletcher’s second touchdown of the day, this one from 3 yards out. That made the score 17-14 and Indiana was under pressure to complete the victory.\n\nAs has been the case all season, Indiana was up to the challenge. The Hoosiers went on an arduous 12 play, 75 yard drive, capped off by a 12 yard touchdown run by Fernando Mendoza on 4th down. Another massive, MASSIVE play in a key moment, which has been Indiana’s specialty and calling card all season long.\n\nUndeterred, Miami punched back AGAIN. An 8 play, 91 yard touchdown drive, capped by a Malachi Toney 22 yard touchdown on a jet touch pass put Miami back in the game, trailing 24-21. Indiana would work the ball down the field on their next drive, but had to settle for a field goal to make the score 27-21.\n\nOn Miami’s final drive, Carson Beck started slowly (he was almost sacked on the first play), then got going. Following a roughing the passer penalty, Beck had completions of 11 to Marty Brown, 7 to Malachi Toney, and 6 to C.J. Daniels. Indiana called timeout to set the defense for the final stretch.\n\nAnd that’s when the dream died.\n\nOn the first play after Indiana’s final timeout, Beck lofted a pass up the left sideline toward Keelan Marion. Indiana, however, was playing perfect trap coverage, disguising the play to make Marion appear to be open, but the corner playing trail technique was hoping the ball would come his way to make a play. And make a play Jamari Sharpe did, leaping into the air to intercept the pass, killing Miami’s drive and their season.\n\nIndiana kneeled the ball twice to run out the clock and win the National Championship by a 27-21 score.\n\nMiami ends the season 13-3 following the loss.\n\nIndiana is the first team in CFB history to go 16-0.",

    "fullText": "SAN ANGELO, Texas (Concho Valley Homepage) — The Rams and Rambelles stay home for a midweek matchup versus Texas A&M-Kingsville.\n\nThe Angelo State Rams and Rambelles are set to host Lone Star Conference rival Texas A&M-Kingsville in back-to-back games. Before the matchups tip off on Wednesday night, both teams have lots to build on following last week’s performances.\n\nHead coach Alesha Ellis and the Rambelles split their home series last week, losing to UT Permian Basin and defeating UT Dallas. The biggest difference in the second game revolves around ball distribution. Four different Rambelles reached double figures in the same game, led by Taylor Grona and Majik Esquivel with 16 and 14 points, respectively. The key going forward is continued ball distribution along with primary leadership, especially among the two young athletes.\n\n“[Grona and Esquivel] are some of the best competitors that I’ve ever coached,” Ellis said. “Taylor has done such a great job and so has Majik. They’re only sophomores this year, so they’re pretty young. They come to practice every day willing to get better, and they’re the ones asking how to get better.”\n\nOn the Rams’ side, the injury bug continues. Limited player availability is a disadvantage anytime, but the Rams refuse to go down without a fight. Angelo State comes off a win over UT Permian Basin and loss to UT Dallas. The biggest difference in those games was UT Dallas’ zone defense displayed in the second half, something head coach Vinay Patel’s squad wasn’t previously accustomed to.\n\n“We just have not seen a ton of zone this year, [so it was] probably smart on [UT Dallas’] part to zone us,” Patel said. “Some of our top three-point shooters have been out with injury, but it’s the first time that we’ve seen a predominant zone for an entire half. I thought it became contagious when we started missing shots. We spent the weekend working on our zone attack, making sure we’re ready if we see it again and try to figure some different things out.”",

    "description": "The Hoosiers beat Miami 27-21 for their first national title ever.",
    "fullText": "We are living in a world where Indiana is the champion of the College Football Playoff.\n\nThe Hoosiers capped a 16-0 season with a 27-21 win over Miami in the national championship game on Monday night. It’s simply one of the most improbable stories in modern sports history. Indiana was recently the program with the most losses in college football history. Now the Hoosiers are on top of the world.\n\nHere are the five plays that defined Indiana’s championship in the order they happened.\n\nThe Hoosiers led 10-0 at halftime but Miami snuck back into the game early in the third quarter on RB Mark Fletcher’s 57-yard TD run. The Hoosiers punted twice after Fletcher’s score, but Miami didn’t come close to taking the lead.\n\nAnd then the game officially got wild. Kamara easily got around his blocker to get his hand on Dylan Joyce’s kick. The ball bounded into the end zone, where it was recovered by Isaiah Jones for a TD.\n\nBLOCKED PUNT‼️\n\nTOUCHDOWN INDIANA 🤯\n\n📺ESPN pic.twitter.com/TwBKbPH52Z\n\n— College Football Playoff (@CFBPlayoff) January 20, 2026\n\nIt was the second straight playoff game with a blocked punt for the Hoosiers. In the Peach Bowl, Daniel Ndukwe blocked a punt in the fourth quarter as Indiana was blowing out Oregon.\n\nKamara and Jones are two of Indiana’s key players on defense. But Indiana coach Curt Cignetti isn’t afraid to use his starters on special teams. And that decision paid off handsomely Monday night.\n\nIt’s impossible to overstate the importance of Mendoza’s touchdown run in Indiana football history. It’s the biggest play ever for Indiana and it’s not even close.\n\nAhead of the title game, the defining moment of Indiana’s season and Mendoza’s Heisman Trophy was his game-winning TD pass to Omar Cooper Jr. against Penn State. Now, Cooper’s toe tap in the back of the end zone has been surpassed by the image of Mendoza diving headlong into the end zone.\n\nTHAT’S WHY HE’S MR. HEISMAN 😤\n\n📺ESPN pic.twitter.com/qZLtsHmudy\n\n— College Football Playoff (@CFBPlayoff) January 20, 2026\n\nIt’s an individual effort that stands out in its own right. But the context adds even more greatness. Mendoza’s run came on a designed QB draw on fourth down after Indiana called timeout for the second time in the second half.\n\nWith 5 yards needed for the first down, you couldn’t have blamed Cignetti for kicking the field goal for a likely six-point lead. A fourth-down failure could have been a big jolt for Miami. Undeterred by that possibility, Cignetti left his offense out on the field after using the timeout and Mendoza broke multiple tackles before stretching the ball out across the goal line for a 24-14 lead.\n\nMendoza’s TD could have been a backbreaker for Miami. It put the Hoosiers up 24-14 with less than 10 minutes to go.\n\nInstead, Miami cut Indiana’s lead to three. Again.\n\nTONEY THROUGH TRAFFIC 🚦\n\n📺ESPN pic.twitter.com/OP4fq6nLGC\n\n— College Football Playoff (@CFBPlayoff) January 20, 2026\n\nMalachi Toney accounted for 71 yards of a 91-yard drive for the Hurricanes. The eighth and final play of that drive came when Toney took a short pass from Carson Beck and ran 22 yards for a touchdown.\n\nIt was the third time Miami had cut Indiana’s lead to three in the second half. It was also the final time. The Hurricanes never led at any point during the game.\n\nToney, meanwhile, finished with 10 catches for 122 yards to cap off a stellar freshman season. A player who could still be in high school, Toney reclassified to enroll early at Miami and was the team’s leading receiver as a true freshman in 2025.\n\nSophomore receiver Charlie Becker emerged as a reliable target for Mendoza over the second half of the season. And he continued to make clutch catches on Monday night.\n\nJust look at this fourth-down grab just plays before Mendoza's touchdown run.\n\ncharlie becker catch; miami vs indiana pic.twitter.com/yFWVYL0u3K\n\n— ◇ (@F0RGIAT0) January 20, 2026\n\nBecker then made a similar catch over eight minutes later that nearly clinched the game for the Hoosiers.\n\nFERNANDO MENDOZA TO CHARLIE BECKER 🔥 #NationalChampionship pic.twitter.com/HwrJDMiUOp\n\n— TSN (@TSN_Sports) January 20, 2026\n\nBecker caught a 19-yard pass on third-and-7 with 2:30 to go to put Indiana at the Miami 33-yard line. Had the pass fallen incomplete, Indiana would have been punting from midfield and Miami would have had all three of its timeouts while trailing 24-21.\n\nInstead, Indiana kicked a field goal to go up 27-21. And by the time that Miami got the ball back with 1:42 to go, the Hurricanes had used all three of their timeouts.\n\nMiami nearly made it incredibly interesting though.\n\nThanks to a roughing the passer call on the second play of the drive, Miami got across midfield with just over 50 seconds to go and a short completion to CJ Daniels put the Hurricanes at the Indiana 41-yard line.\n\nBut with the clock running after a first down, Carson Beck tried to go deep to Keelan Marion with a safety closing in from the middle of the field. The ball was underthrown and Sharpe, the corner trailing Marion on the play, was able to easily make the interception.\n\nJAMARI SHARPE INTERCEPTION\n\nTHE INDIANA HOOSIERS ARE YOUR NATIONAL CHAMPIONS #PMSBigCollegeGame pic.twitter.com/lkBuBn0Kcb\n\n— Pat McAfee (@PatMcAfeeShow) January 20, 2026\n\nAfter kneeling down inside the 10-yard line, Sharpe was penalized for taking his helmet off in celebrating. But after two quick plays to run out the clock, the field position didn’t matter. Indiana had won its first national title.",

    "fullText": "For a lot of reasons, Monday’s CFP championship game was a win for the people, the fans.\n\nNo. 1 Indiana 27, No. 10 Miami (at home) 21.\n\nWith all the politicking, the heavy dose of ESPN protecting its broadcasting brands in the SEC, and a CFP Selection Committee as confused as a crosseyed fox in a rabbit pen, this title game proved experts were, well, no experts at all on picking a champion.\n\nThis game featured outstanding trench work. The lines were monster good.\n\nBut in the end, Indiana’s gritty, punishing, big-play consistency won out.\n\nOn defense, Indiana didn’t have to do much more than give Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza an extra second.\n\nHe did the rest for the 16-0 Hoosiers.\n\nAnd suddenly the center of college football is in Bloomington. Not Columbus, not Athens, not Tuscaloosa.\n\nFernando Mendoza looks like he makes his animal crackers fight each other before he eats them\n\n— Saint Zoe 🇺🇸🇭🇹 (@Jupinapapi3) January 19, 2026\n\nYes, this was the people’s championship.\n\nFirst of all, this was a people’s championship because it jumped the shark with the media and the system.\n\nIn a preseason poll of 50 national media experts by On3 Sports, none, exactly none, had either Indiana or Miami playing for the title.\n\nJust like I drew it up… https://t.co/1DSKZUGhXi\n\n— Andy Staples (@AndyStaples) January 8, 2026\n\nThat, in itself, is kind of entertaining. The doctor had no predicted cure. The experts were 100% wrong. The punditry failed at what their high-paid heads were enlisted to pontificate about.\n\nThere were names everyone in sports knows and sees daily.\n\nThere were 12 of the 50 that picked Penn State to win it all. This group included Phil Steele, Chris Vannini of The Athletic, Greg McElroy, Mark Schlabach, Rece Davis of ESPN, and Ross Dellenger (Yahoo Sports). Penn State finished 7-6 and fired James Franklin midseason\n\nAnother 12 of these experts picked Texas to win it all. These included Andy Staples of On3 Sports and Paul Finebaum (SEC Network). The Longhorns finished 10-3 overall, 6-2 in the SEC, failed to make the league title game, and was not in the 12-team playoff field.\n\nSix of these prophets of the gridiron picked Clemson, a team that finished 7-6 in the ACC. Another six picked LSU, including ESPN’s Kirk Herbstreit and Lee Corso. LSU finished a 7-6 team, fired Brian Kelly in the middle of the season, and didn’t make the playoff.\n\nAlabama did make the CFP but lost to Indiana in the second round. None of the 50 picked Indiana, Mississippi or Miami to be in the Final Four of the CFP.\n\nWhat this means is you can’t make predictions on returning production in college football. The NIL era has changed how you read the scales — and even then it’s a crapshoot, just roll the dice.\n\nSecond, we like heroes as Americans.\n\nMendoza fits every description of that as an un-recruited, zero star nobody who rose above every measure you can throw at a QB star and he delivered.\n\nPressured more than he’s been in all the CFP games, perhaps more than all season long, he got pushed, hit, blasted and even illegally hit with a helmet to the head. And still delivered.\n\nHis 12-yard QB sneak touchdown with 9:18 left in the game was moxie exemplified.\n\nOn fourth and 4 from the 12, he paused for a second and took off, avoiding four Miami defender hits with a leaping, stretched-out dive for the end zone. That play was the finishing touch on a brilliant 75-yard, 12-play drive where he made a crucial fourth-down completion.\n\nThird, this CFP proved going from four teams to 12 in the field was a good move. If we hadn’t had 12 teams, Miami wouldn’t have played Monday night. The CFP’s top four ranked teams were Indiana, Ohio State, Georgia and Oregon.\n\nNow folks are talking about expanding to 14 teams with the possibility of a 16-team field. There is some talk of going to a controversial 24-team playoff, which would be quite insane.\n\nFourth, while Miami lost, we got to see BYU transfer Keelan Marion.\n\nWhile Marion’s impact wasn’t flashy, Carson Beck’s last-gasp pass attempt to win the game was thrown his way. And picked off.\n\nMarion did have a key block on Miami’s second touchdown drive, a 4-yarder by Mark Fletcher, who broke Ezekiel Elliott’s playoff record for rushing yards. Marion got mentions. He got air time. He was right there at the end and could have been a hero if not for an underthrown pass his way.\n\nIndiana goes undefeated, wire to wire.\n\nThey came from nowhere to the top of the game.",

    "fullText": "Detroit Lions predicted to cut longtime franchise cornerstone originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNothing lasts forever, and that will be true for Taylor Decker’s tenure with the Detroit Lions.\n\nThe Lions drafted Decker a decade ago, in the first round (16th overall) of the 2016 NFL Draft. He’s been a staple on the offensive line in Detroit ever since, starting in all 140 regular season games that he has played in for the Lions. He's currently the team's longest-tenured player.\n\nBut, the Lions could decide to move on this offseason. In a recent article, ESPN’s Aaron Schatz predicts that the Lions will cut Decker in the coming weeks, if he doesn’t retire, due to declining production.\n\nDecker was named to his first Pro Bowl in 2024, but he took a step backwards in 2025.\n\n\"The Lions will cut left tackle Taylor Decker if he does not retire. He will be 33 years old next season and has had issues with shoulder injuries. In 2025, he fell to 45th out of 69 ranked tackles in pass block win rate, and he ranked 61st in run block win rate.\"\n\nOf course, if Decker decides to retire, the Lions wouldn’t have to cut him, and it sounds like that’s something he’s strongly considering.\n\n“You can’t play football forever,” Decker said after Detroit’s season ended earlier this month. “… “I’m a fortunate player who’s got to be on one team. I’ve got to be here for 10 years. I take a lot of pride in that, and I think that makes it weigh heavily on my heart even more.”\n\nOne way or another, it sounds like Decker's days in Detroit are numbered.\n\nBaltimore Ravens predicted to cut ties with All-Pro defender\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles predicted to make quarterback trade over offseason\n\nPittsburgh Steelers urged to avoid veteran quarterback in free agency",

    "fullText": "Juventus went to Sardinia riding high after two very good wins over provincial clubs to extend a nice run of form\n\nThen returned home to Turin with a whole lot of frustration attached to them.\n\nThat is what happens when you don’t play well and lose 1-0 to a team that is sitting just outside the relegation zone. And you do it in the kind of fashion in which Juventus did so — which involved a lot of possession but not an overwhelming amount of quality scoring chances that left them certainly wanting more.\n\nWith all of the other results that went against Juventus this past weekend, it was not a good Matchday 21 for Luciano Spalletti’s men, who now trail league leaders Inter Milan by 10 points and are down in fifth place following Roma’s win over Torino.\n\nJust a rough weekend all the way around no matter how you want to try and spin it.\n\nYou can listen to Episode 321 of The Old Lady Speaks Podcast on the player below or your favorite podcast platform.

    "fullText": "Undefeated teams in college football history: Here's a list of every perfect national champion all time originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nCollege football tends to thrive on chaos.\n\nUpsets are what makes the sport so captivating at times — when a smaller school topples a national power, it reminds fans what they enjoy so much about the landscape of NCAA football. But while upsets are fun, there are sometimes teams that are simply too dominant to overcome.\n\nCollege football has had its share of teams to go unbeaten across an entire season, some of which also claimed a win in that year's national championship. Some undefeated squads didn't get the opportunity to play for the title, while others steamrolled their way to college football glory, whether in the College Football Playoff, Bowl Championship Series or other previous playoff systems.\n\nHere's a full breakdown of the history of undefeated college football teams, including national champions.\n\nMORE: Which teams have the most wins in college football history?\n\nWith college football having a complicated history within its structure, there a few ways to view the history of undefeated teams — regardless of whether they won a national championship or not. In total, there have likely been hundreds teams to finish a college football season unbeaten, but with varying circumstances, tiebreaker and playoff rules and number of games.\n\nPre-1900, when college football was still free of ties and informal with plenty of differing rules, the NCAA has 26 teams on-record to finish their season unbeaten and untied, per the NCAA's 2009 Division I records report, which included any teams with a minimum of five games against opponents above the high school level. From 1900 to 1936, the year the AP Poll was introduced, there were an additional 133 teams to finish a season unbeaten and untied.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1991, the year before the Bowl Coalition was created — helping to better establish a national champion and provide better-quality bowl matchups — the NCAA has 134 teams on-record to finish a season unbeaten and untied.\n\nFrom 1992-2013, which spans between the Bowl Coalition, Bowl Alliance and Bowl Championship Series eras of the postseason, the NCAA has 40 teams on-record to go unbeaten and untied.\n\nHowever, in terms of comparing college football teams, it's easiest to assess the unbeaten teams in the College Football Playoff era, since 2014. Because this playoff format is still used by the NCAA, allows top teams to go head-to-head in the playoff, and limits the number of unbeaten squads, it's the easiest way to assess a \"perfect\" team in recent history.\n\nIn the CFP era, there have been seven FBS teams to go unbeaten in a full season, six of which won the CFP championship. A 13-0 USF team in 2017, which was not selected to the playoff bracket, is the lone non-champion.\n\nTrimming the parameters from 1994-2025, which largely covers the most modern era of college football, there have been a total of 30 FBS teams to go undefeated in a season. Nebraska had three (1994, 1995, 1997), while 11 of those 30 teams did not with the national championship, for varying reasons.\n\nOverall, the history of unbeaten teams is a complicated one, especially when looking at non-national champions. With the CFP in place, the era of multiple undefeated teams in one season is virtually obsolete, helping to quiet those complications. For years, there were consistently undefeated teams that didn't get a shot at the championship, including 1998 Tulane, 2004 Auburn, 2006 Boise State, 2008 Utah and 2010 TCU.\n\nExamining the history of undefeated teams to win the national championship is a bit more defined — while there have been many college football teams to finish a season unbeaten, especially in the early eras of the sport, a more select few have gone unbeaten with a title.\n\nMORE: Most losses in college football history by school\n\nSince 1936, the year the Associated Press released its first Top 25 poll, there have been 64 NCAA-recognized undefeated college football champions. That includes co-title holders.\n\nNotre Dame has six of those perfect championship seasons, while Nebraska and Alabama both have five.\n\nHere's the list of every undefeated national champion, separated by era (CFP, BCS, pre-BCS), according to the NCAA.\n\nMORE:What to know about college football overtime rules\n\nIn January of 2026, Indiana became the most recent undefeated college football team.\n\nPrior to Indiana, the last college football team to finish a season undefeated was the Michigan Wolverines in 2023. Led by head coach John Harbaugh and quarterback J.J. McCarthy, the Big Ten squad went 15-0 and won the College Football Playoff championship over Washington. Michigan's 2023 season resulted in controversy over a sign-stealing scandal, however.\n\nHarbaugh, in his ninth season at Michigan, guided his team to a 12-0 regular season in 2023. The Wolverines then beat Iowa 26-0 in the Big Ten Championship game and took down Alabama 27-20 in overtime of the Rose Bowl, a CFP semifinal game. To win the national title, Michigan beat Washington 34-13, winning the 12 title in program history and first since 1997.\n\nMichigan became the first national champion to have a lead at halftime in every game it played since 2001 Miami. Harbaugh's unit also became the first-ever Big Ten team to go 15-0. Outside of McCarthy, key contributors included guard Zak Zinte, running back Blake Corum, tight end Colston Loveland, defensive lineman Mason Graham and cornerbacks Mike Sainristil and Will Johnson.\n\nThere were a few reasons for controversy around Michigan's 2023 season, though. For one, Harbaugh had been suspended by his university for the first three games of the season due to alleged recruiting violations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, in November of the 2023 season, a sign-stealing scandal became apparent that gained national interests.\n\nIn October 2023, the NCAA began Michigan's football program amid allegations of sign-stealing, the Big Ten announced. The Wolverines were being accused of in-person scouting of future opponents. In early November, staffer Connor Stalions resigned due to his role in the schemes, while Harbaugh was suspended by the Big Ten for the team's final three regular-season games for violating sportsmanship rules.\n\nEventually, the NCAA's investigation officially found in 2025 that Michigan's football program had \"committed violations involving an off-campus, in-person scouting scheme.\" Through interview testimonies, ticket receipts and transfer data and other evidence, Stalions was found to have made scouting violations.\n\n\"During the 2021, 2022 and 2023 football seasons, Stalions directed and arranged for individuals to conduct off-campus, in-person scouting of Michigan's future regular-season opponents. In doing so, Stalions purchased game tickets and transferred them to those individuals, who included another staff member, interns and acquaintances of Stalions. The network of individuals was referred to as the 'KGB.' While in attendance, they filmed the signal callers on the future opponents' sidelines and then provided that film to Stalions,\" the NCAA's report said. \"Using the footage they collected — which Stalions referred to as 'dirty film' — Stalions then deciphered opponents' signals. Stalions and other individuals involved in the scheme acknowledged or corroborated this process.\n\nAdditionally, on one occasion, Stalions personally attended a future opponent's contest. In total, 56 instances of off-campus, in-person scouting of 13 future regular- season opponents occurred across 52 contests.\"\n\nThe NCAA's report also said that Stalions had spent nearly $35,000 on tickets in 2022 alone for the scheme. It also reported that Stalions, Harbaugh, Sherrone Moore and former director of player personnel Denard Robinson all failed to meet \"expectations of cooperation\" in the investigation, ranging from \"destroying relevant materials\" to \"providing false and misleading information during interviews.\"\n\nPunishments for the scandal were also released by the NCAA. Then-Michigan head coach, Sherrone Moore, was suspended three games, Stalions received an eight-year show-cause penalty, Harbaugh received a 10-year show-cause, and a fine was expected to eclipse $30 million for the school, per ESPN.\n\nRegardless of that investigation and the noise in made in the college football world, the Wolverines continued their dominance into the CFP and completed a perfect season. After the title win, Harbaugh left the program to be the head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers in the NFL, not dealing with many of the consequences that were handed to the program from the sign-stealing scandal.\n\nMORE:Explaining the 2025 Sherrone Moore scandal at Michigan\n\nTwo teams have gone 16-0 in college football history: Indiana in 2025 and Yale in 1984. While Yale football team accomplished the feat. in 1984, thought, there are plenty of reasons to take that feat with a bit of an asterisk.\n\nThere wasn't just no CFP or no officially recognized national champions in 1894 — there was minimal padding for players and no helmets. It was a much different sport in the late 19th century and early 20th century.\n\nSince then, there have been a number of teams to go 15-0, but going 16-0 often hasn't been a possibility due to the length of the regular season, or the playoff format. If you count the FCS, there has been one other 16-0 team: North Dakota State in 2019.\n\nWith the creation of the 12-team CFP in 2024, it became possible for an FBS team to play 16 games between the regular season, their conference championship and the playoff bracket. In January 2026, the Indiana Hoosiers joined 1894 Yale as the only 16-0 teams in college football history.\n\nMORE: The full list of biggest blowouts in CFP history",

    "fullText": "Jimmy Butler injury looks like horrible news for Warriors originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors haven’t succeeded in avoiding the injury bug thus far.\n\nThe Warriors’ star point guard, Stephen Curry, has missed several contests due to quadricep and ankle setbacks, causing the franchise’s offense to suffer on the hardwood.\n\nOn Monday, Jimmy suffered an apparent knee injury against the Miami Heat that looked horrible in real time and on replay.\n\nEssentially, Butler came down awkwardly as he was preparing to finish around the rim and was forced to exit the contest in the third quarter.\n\nAlthough one may argue that it’s too early for Warriors fans to begin panicking, the fact that the six-time All-Star could’t walk off the floor without assistance from his teammates suggests that he could be dealing with a significant injury.\n\nIf Butler is unable to return to action anytime soon, it’s safe to say Curry will have to return to his superhuman ways for the Dubs to survive moving forward.\n\nJonathan Kuminga hasn't played in a game with the Warriors in a month, and the organization’s key role players (Moses Moody, Brandin Podziemski, Quentin Post, Will Richard, etc.) can’t be relied upon to be high-level complementary pieces alongside Curry nightly.\n\nHopefully, Butler, who’s averaging 20.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 4.9 assists per game on 51.9% field goal shooting and 38.1% three-point shooting this season, isn’t dealing with a season/career-altering injury.\n\nMore NBA: Warriors predicted to reunite with beloved $109 million NBA champion via Jonathan Kuminga trade",

    "fullText": "Manchester City take on Bodø/Glimt tonight at the Aspmyra Stadion. The match is Manchester City’s seventh UEFA Champions League league phase fixture. It is an important match for Pep Guardiola’s side. If they can win tonight, they’ll move closer to securing a top-eight finish and a path to the round of 16 stage of the UEFA Champions League. Bodø/Glimt sit 32nd in the Champions League league phase table, and they must win tonight to keep their slim chances of securing a top-24 finish in the table alive.\n\nHere is the latest Manchester City injury and team news and my predicted City starting eleven ahead of tonight’s match.\n\nThere are a host of players unavailable for Manchester City for tonight’s match. John Stones, Ruben Dias, Josko Gvardiol, Mateo Kovacic, Nico, Oscar Bobb, and Savinho will all miss tonight’s match due to injury. Matheus Nunes is ruled out of tonight’s match due to the flu. It is hoped that he can return for Manchester City’s upcoming Premier League fixture against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Phil Foden is available for tonight’s match despite the fact that he broke his hand in Manchester City’s defeat to Manchester United last Saturday.\n\nNew signings Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo are unavailable for tonight’s match. They cannot be registered in Manchester City’s Champions League squad until after the January transfer window closes.\n\nLastly, Manchester City captain Bernardo Silva is suspended for tonight’s match.\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma: I cannot see Pep Guardiola making a change in goal given how important tonight’s match is for his team. I expect Donnarumma to start.\n\nRico Lewis: With Matheus Nunes unavailable, and City lacking defensive options, I can see Rico Lewis starting at right-back.\n\nMax Alleyne: I cannot see Nathan Ake starting on a synthetic pitch given the fact that he is clearly playing through injury. That means Max Alleyne should keep his place at centre-back.\n\nAbdukodir Khusanov: Khusanov is an automatic selection for tonight’s match.\n\nRayan Ait-Nouri: The Algerian international needs minutes in his legs and he is my choice to start at left-back. I feel that Nico O’Reilly will be saved for a role in midfield during tonight’s match.\n\nRodri: Manchester City’s midfield general has to start tonight’s match given the players missing for City.\n\nTijjani Reijnders: The Dutch international seems to be a lock to start in midfield.\n\nRayan Cherki: Cherki should start tonight. I’d like to see him start centrally rather than out wide.\n\nPhil Foden: Foden is playing with a broken hand but is available for tonight’s match. I feel that he could start on the right wing in a bid to get himself back into form.\n\nOmar Marmoush: The Egyptian international could return to the City starting lineup tonight. It is hard to see Pep Guardiola risking Doku so Marmoush could start in his place.\n\nErling Haaland: Manchester City’s top scorer will relish the opportunity to play in Norway. He needs a big performance to click himself back into gear.",

    "description": "The 2025 season is hardly over. That's not stopping us from looking eight months ahead.",
    "fullText": "The 2025 season just barely ended, but that's not stopping us from looking eight months ahead.\n\nHere's our way-too-early top 25 for the 2026 college football season. A lot can and will change in the months before the season begins in late August. But here's our quick and undoubtedly wrong look at how the field could stack up.\n\nHow do the Cavaliers follow up the best season in school history? Tony Elliott signed QBs Beau Pribula (Missouri) and Eli Holstein (Pitt) to replace Chandler Morris along with a few key defenders from the transfer portal. Virginia should be near the top of the ACC again.\n\nQB Luke Altmyer is out of eligibility and Bret Bielema brought in former East Carolina QB Katin Houser to replace him. The addition of FIU WR Alex Perry could be significant too. He had 56 grabs for 840 yards in 2025. This is a team that’s won 19 games over the past two seasons and should again be safely bowl eligible.\n\nThe Huskies dodged a huge loss when Demond Williams Jr. decided he was going to stay for the 2026 season. Williams can enter the season as a sleeper Heisman candidate and is the reason why we have Washington ranked. If he had left, coach Jedd Fisch would have had a huge hole to fill at QB.\n\nIs it a make-or-break season for Shane Beamer? Yes, the Gamecocks had a rough schedule in 2025, but the defense took a step back and the offensive line was rough. SC added NC State OL Jacarrius Peak in the transfer portal and QB LaNorris Sellers is back along with edge rusher Dylan Stewart.\n\nDid Houston have the quietest 10-win season in 2025? QB Conner Weigman is back for a second season after he threw for over 2,700 yards and 25 TDs and the Cougars have added a very solid transfer class. The team’s top two signees are offensive linemen and former Tulane RB Makhi Hughes comes over from Oregon where he hopes to recapture the form he had with the Green Wave.\n\nWe’re already bullish on the quick turnaround James Franklin can engineer in Blacksburg. He’s brought over a host of transfers from Penn State, including QB Ethan Grunkemeyer and TE Luke Reynolds along with CB Jaquez White from Troy and edge rusher Javion Hilson from Missouri.\n\nCan Lincoln Kienholz have a breakout season with the Cardinals? After multiple seasons as a backup at Ohio State, Kienholz is now the favorite to start at QB. Coach Jeff Brohm kept RB Isaac Brown from entering the transfer portal and also added Vanderbilt WR Tre Richardson.\n\nAs many former Nittany Lions have gone to Virginia Tech, even more Iowa State players have followed Matt Campbell to State College. That includes QB Rocco Becht, RB Carson Hansen, CB Jeremiah Cooper and a bunch of others. Building a team out of Iowa State players isn’t flashy, but Campbell is the winningest coach in school history for a reason.\n\nThe Mustangs bring back QB Kevin Jennings and added former Cal RB Kendrick Raphael in the transfer portal. He rushed for 943 yards and 13 scores in 2025. The loss of offensive coordinator Casey Woods could hurt — he’s the new head coach at Missouri State — but Rhett Lashlee’s offense should be one of the best in the ACC once again.\n\nIt’s hard to see how Michigan could have done much better than getting Kyle Whittingham after it fired Sherrone Moore. Whittingham brings offensive coordinator Jason Beck with him from Utah and Bryce Underwood could have a breakout season under Beck. DE John Henry Daley and other players have followed Whittingham from Salt Lake City, too.\n\nThe Cougars lost defensive coordinator Jay Hill after Whittingham hired him at Michigan and replaced Hill with longtime assistant Kelly Poppinga. QB Bear Bachmeier should be even better in 2026 and getting leading rusher LJ Martin back for his senior year is a big boost.\n\nThe Trojans have the top-ranked recruiting class in the country heading into the 2026 season. How many of those players can make an immediate impact? Lincoln Riley’s offense will be very good once again. The onus is on the defense … again. The Trojans haven’t allowed fewer than 5.5 yards per play since it gave up 5.4 yards a play in 2018 under Clay Helton.\n\nWe’re betting on a full offseason of health for John Mateer. He’s back for another run at it with the Sooners and was fantastic before he suffered a broken bone in his throwing hand in Week 4 against Auburn. OU’s defense was good enough to win a national title in 2025, but the offense simply wasn’t in the second half of the season.\n\nWith Ty Simpson off to the NFL, it’s up to Austin Mack or Keelon Russell to start at QB for the Crimson Tide. Mack has more familiarity with Kalen DeBoer and Ryan Grubb’s offensive system. Russell is a former five-star recruit. The Tide also bring in No. 1 running back recruit Ezavier Crowell. Can he make Alabama’s run game work again?\n\nLet’s be clear: This ranking is betting on Trinidad Chambliss winning his legal fight to get a sixth year of eligibility from the NCAA. The Rebels are clear contenders to get back to the College Football Playoff if he’s back in Oxford. If he’s not, there are major questions at quarterback after Austin Simmons transferred to Missouri.\n\nJust like with Ole Miss, we’re doing a bit of quarterback projection here and assuming that Darian Mensah ends up a Hurricane. If he doesn’t, then adjust your expectations accordingly. A young secondary should get even better in 2026 and Malachi Toney will be a sleeper Heisman candidate.\n\nQB CJ Carr got better as the season went on in 2025 and could be one of the best quarterbacks in college football in 2026. The Irish made some late moves in the transfer portal, have the No. 2 high school recruiting class in the country and, most importantly, coach Marcus Freeman rebuffed NFL interest to stay in South Bend.\n\nThe Aggies bring back QB Marcel Reed, RB Le’Veon Moss and WR Mario Craver. They also have On3’s No. 3 transfer portal class as they’ve loaded up on defense. Five of the Aggies’ top six rated transfers are all on that side of the ball, including former Tennessee QB Rickey Gibson and former Northwestern edge rusher Anto Saka.\n\nRaiding the transfer portal worked really well for Texas Tech ahead of the 2025 season. Why not do it again and add a QB this time? Brendan Sorsby comes over from Cincinnati and Texas Tech is reloading up front again after the success that its defensive line had in 2025.\n\nLane Kiffin got his quarterback in former Arizona State signal-caller Sam Leavitt. He also added former five-star recruit Husan Longstreet from USC. LSU was one of the biggest underachievers in 2025. This is a roster that can make the College Football Playoff. And, given the way Kiffin left Ole Miss, anything less than making the CFP semifinals can be considered a disappointment.\n\nQB Gunner Stockton is set to come back after he finished in the top 10 of the Heisman voting. The Bulldogs need to replace Zachariah Branch and CJ Allen, but this is a team loaded with top-tier recruits. Even though Georgia has lost in the quarterfinals in each of the past two seasons, we’re not betting against Kirby Smart’s team anytime soon.\n\nQB Julian Sayin and WR Jeremiah Smith are back as the Buckeyes are now the chasers in the Big Ten once again. Losing Sonny Styles, Arvell Reese and Caleb Downs on defense is significant, but Matt Patricia’s unit was so, so good in 2025 that it’s hard to see them taking a huge step back in 2026.\n\nThe Hoosiers have become one of the best teams at navigating the transfer portal and they have the top class in the country in 2026 after winning the national championship this season. Former TCU QB Josh Hoover is in line to replace Fernando Mendoza and WR Nick Marsh is a stellar add from Michigan State. Don’t overlook the edge rushing depth that Curt Cignetti signed as well.\n\nGet ready for another offseason of Texas talk. Don’t say you haven’t been warned. The Longhorns have loaded up on offense for what could be QB Arch Manning’s final season. RBs Raleek Brown and Hollywood Smothers arrived via the transfer portal along with former Auburn WR Cam Coleman. Oh, the defense is coordinated by Will Muschamp again, too. How good can he make that unit?\n\nThe return of Dante Moore for the 2026 season isn’t the only reason the Ducks are in this spot. Yes, Oregon loses TE Kenyon Sadiq, S Dillon Thieneman and LB Bryce Boettcher, but Matayo Uiagalelei is back along the defensive line along with A’Mauri Washington and Bear Alexander. RB Jordon Davison should be better as a sophomore and Oregon added Minnesota S Koi Perich in the transfer portal too.",

    "fullText": "Why did the Titans hire Robert Saleh? Former 49ers DC, Jets head coach lands in Tennessee to lead Cam Ward originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Tennessee Titans have found their next voice to lead Cam Ward.\n\nRobert Saleh is finalizing a deal with the Titans to become their next head coach, Adam Schefter reported late Monday night. The news comes after Saleh completed two official interviews with the team, and \"the two sides impressed each other enough to move forward together,\" per Schefter.\n\nNow, Saleh, the San Francisco 49ers’ defensive coordinator in 2025 and former New York Jets head coach, will be tasked with helping the Titans return to prominence in the AFC after multiple seasons of struggles, with a franchise quarterback already in place.\n\nHere’s what to know about the Titans hiring Saleh.\n\n3 reasons why every team remaining will (and won't) win Super Bowl\n\nInside the Patriots vs. Broncos AFC championship matchup\n\nPredicting the Super Bowl 60 matchup\n\nBreaking down Seahawks vs. Rams NFC championship matchup\n\nThe Titans' hire is set to be the fourth of the 2026 NFL coaching cycle, with John Harbaugh heading to the Giants, Kevin Stefanski heading to the Falcons and Jeff Hafley heading to the Dolphins. As Tennessee moved through its interview processes, it became apparent that Saleh was one of the favorites for the job.\n\nAccording to Schefter, Saleh spent Monday in Tennessee with the team, and \"the two sides impressed each other enough to move forward together.\" Ian Rapoport added that Saleh \" impressed during the interview process.\"\n\nMatt Nagy was also believed to be one of the top candidates for the Titans' head coaching role — the team announced Monday that it had completed second interviews with both Nagy and Saleh, two former head coaches.\n\nWe've completed in-person interviews with the following candidates. pic.twitter.com/Mctvgl2U5K\n\n— Tennessee Titans (@Titans) January 20, 2026\n\nInterestingly, Saleh, a defensive mind, was the choice over Nagy, an offensive mind. Saleh brings a mix of defensive prowess, leadership and head coaching experience to the Titans, an organization certainly needing stability after a 3-14 season.\n\nSaleh will be a head coach for the second time, as he led the Jets from 2021-24. That stint did not go too well — he racked up a 20-36 record — but Saleh wasn't always viewed as the sole person to blame for New York's struggles. At best, he helped bring more of an edge to the Jets, including his time leading Aaron Rodgers.\n\nAfter being fired five games into the 2024 season, Saleh wound up heading to the 49ers as Kyle Shanahan's defensive coordinator in the 2025 season, finding plenty of success despite a long list of injuries. The Titans were clearly impressed, now hoping Saleh can help them improve upon a defense that gave up 345.1 yards per game this past season.\n\nAccording to Jordan Schultz, Saleh indicated to teams in interviews that he planned to call defensive plays if he became a head coach again, which he did not do with the Jets.\n\nSaleh will also have an opportunity to join a hyped young quarterback, as Cam Ward had a quiet rookie season, but the Titans are hopeful last year's No. 1 overall pick will continue blossoming toward stardom.\n\nAs a side note, Saleh is now set to face Liam Coen's Jaguars squad twice per season. The two coaches had a bit of drama brewing earlier in the 2025 regular season:\n\nRobert Saleh and Liam Coen are now in the same division 🍿 pic.twitter.com/5lqCPszQ5phttps://t.co/yIt5IzERLK\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) January 20, 2026\n\nMORE:Everything to know about the Liam Coen-Robert Saleh beef\n\nDetails of Saleh's contract with the Titans have not yet been reported.\n\nNFL teams do not have to release details of their coaches' salaries, so it often comes down to whether or not those details are leaked to reporters.\n\nMORE: Why did Buffalo fire Sean McDermott?\n\nAll four of Saleh's seasons as an NFL head coach came with the Jets. Here's a look at his record in New York.\n\nMORE: Everything to know about the Falcons hiring Kevin Stefanski\n\nSaleh has had an extensive coaching career that includes time in college, a long list of NFL assistant roles, and now two head coaching jobs. Notably, he is set to coach his third AFC South team, having previously spent time with the Houston Texans and Jacksonville Jaguars as an assistant.\n\nSaleh’s coaching career began in 2002 as an offensive assistant at Michigan State. He became a defensive assistant for the team in 2003, guiding defensive linemen, and the following year held the same role at Central Michigan.\n\nIn 2005, Saleh moved to Georgia as a defensive assistant leading linebackers. Later that year, he made the jump to the NFL as a defensive intern for the Texans. He became a defensive quality control coach for Houston from 2006–08, then an assistant linebackers coach from 2009–10.\n\nIn 2011, Saleh joined the Seattle Seahawks as a defensive quality control coach, remaining in that role until 2013, when he joined the Jaguars as a linebackers coach.\n\nSaleh’s first stint as the 49ers’ defensive coordinator began in 2017, helping lead the team to the Super Bowl in 2019. He served as San Francisco’s DC under Kyle Shanahan from 2017–20.\n\nIn 2021, the Jets hired Saleh as their head coach, but his four-year run did not result in any playoff appearances. New York built some solid defenses under Saleh but failed to break through, and after a 2-3 start in 2024, they parted ways with him.\n\nSaleh spent a bit of time as a consultant for the Packers before returning to the 49ers as defensive coordinator for the 2025 season. Now, he'll take on another head coaching role in the AFC.\n\nMichigan State, Offensive assistant and defensive assistant (2002-03)\n\nCentral Michigan, Defensive assistant (2004)\n\nGeorgia, Defensive assistant (2005)\n\nHouston Texans, Defensive intern, Defensive quality control coach and assistant LBs coach (2005-10)\n\nSeattle Seahawks, Defensive quality control coach (2011-13)\n\nJacksonville Jaguars, Linebackers coach (2014-16)\n\nSan Francisco 49ers, Defensive coordinator (2017-20)\n\nNew York Jets, Head coach (2021-24)\n\nGreen Bay Packers, Offensive consultant (2024)\n\nSan Francisco 49ers, Defensive coordinator (2025)\n\nTennessee Titans, Head coach (2026–present)\n\nRobert Saleh is 46 years old.

It seems that at the moment, Rennes are just asking too much for him, at least more than what Chelsea want to pay.\n\nThere was even talk yesterday of Chelsea potentially turning to alternative options, with two other names mentioned as being on their shortlist.\n\nBut since Friday/Saturday, there has been no breakthrough after what is now 3/4 days of talks apparently, and Chelsea fans will be getting that feeling of deja vu. They are used to deals breaking down, public pursuits of a player, days and days of the same updates, then it not going through. It’s happened a lot lately.\n\nJeremy Jacquet playing for Rennes.\n\nThe transfer expert said, as picked up on X:\n\n‘Chelsea already went on their mission to France on Friday, still no agreement for Jacquet. Rennes want 65-70m euros, Chelsea want to spend less. Chelsea WILL sign a defender this window with 3 players on their shortlist.’\n\nChelsea fans will feel that this one is now over and they will pivot to another target, because they have been there and see it all before in the last few years under this ownership.\n\nWill they even sign a centre back?

Yeah, about that.\n\nJames Harden reminded everyone Monday afternoon why you never count him out, pouring in 36 points with seven rebounds and nine assists as the Clippers gutted out a 110-106 win over Washington to keep their incredible run going.\n\nJames Harden was HOOPIN' in D.C. today!\n\n🚢 36 PTS\n🚢 9 AST\n🚢 7 REB@LAClippers win their 6th in a row and improve to 13-2 in their last 15 games! pic.twitter.com/0rB6o031zK\n\nThis one wasn't pretty with 11 ties, 10 lead changes, and a finish that had everyone holding their breath, but ugly wins still count, and this team has now rattled off six straight after looking completely lost back in November.\n\nThe ending was pure Harden. He knocked down two free throws with 36.9 seconds left to put the Clippers ahead, then missed two more with 5.9 ticks remaining that could have iced it.\n\nBut John Collins, back in action after missing time with a groin injury, flew in for the offensive rebound and tapped it right back to Harden.\n\nTwo more makes, game over, and suddenly the Clippers are 19-23 and climbing after that disastrous 6-21 hole they dug themselves into.\n\nCollins chipped in 11 points beyond that clutch board, and his return gives this team something they've badly needed: another big body who can score and rebound when defenses sell out to stop Harden.\n\nThen there's Jordan Miller, who just keeps making the most of his opportunity.\n\nEverybody keeps steppin’ up 👏👏👏 pic.twitter.com/9qbKxi3VWQ\n\n— LA Clippers (@LAClippers) January 20, 2026\n\nThe third-year guard dropped 16 points and has quickly become one of the feel-good stories of this turnaround, averaging nearly 15 points over his last five games while shooting a ridiculous 58 percent from the floor.\n\nNobody saw this coming from a guy who was barely in the rotation a month ago, but Miller has grabbed this chance and isn't letting go.\n\nIvica Zubac did his usual thing with 14 points and 12 rebounds, and Kris Dunn added 10 off the bench to round things out.\n\nThe Clippers hop on a plane to Chicago for a Tuesday night date with the Bulls (19-22) on zero days rest, and Kawhi Leonard is still back in Los Angeles getting his knee treated.\n\nKawhi Leonard was NOT named an All-Star starter.\n\n28.2 PPG\n6.3 RPG\n3.5 APG\n2.2 STL\n0.6 BLK\n\n50/40/94 shooting split\n\nROBBED pic.twitter.com/dYx8ET6MwR\n\n— SleeperClippers (@SleeperClippers) January 19, 2026\n\nThat means Harden has to keep carrying this team while the young guys continue stepping into bigger roles.\n\nBut if there's one thing we've learned over the past few weeks, it's that this group knows how to find ways to win.\n\nThey've gone from laughingstock to legitimate playoff threat, and Harden has been the driving force behind every bit of it.\n\nA back-to-back in the Midwest is a tough ask, but count them out at your own risk.",

    "fullText": "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Carson Beck was part of two national championship runs at Georgia.\n\nTo him, those seasons weren't as good as this one was for him at Miami.\n\nBeck's last pass as a college quarterback was an interception, one that essentially sealed Miami's fate in a 27-21 loss to Indiana in the College Football Playoff national championship game on Monday night. He had to watch the Hoosiers celebrate on what was his home field, watch the turf littered in crimson-and-white confetti.\n\nAnd yet, when he reflected on the end of his journey, he declared this year at Miami the best of his life.\n\n“Yeah, it was,” Beck said after a 19-for-32 passing, 232-yard, one-touchdown, one-interception performance in the final. “And not because we made the national championship, not because won a bunch of football games or we made great plays or things of that sort. Man, for me, my whole entire life changed.\n\n\"You know, 365 days ago, I was in just a really dark place, and I was trying to see the light at the end of the tunnel. It was a really difficult thing. There was just a lot going on, mentally, physically, emotionally, to be able to battle and fight through the roller-coaster that life is.\"\n\nAt this time a year ago, Beck was no longer wanted at Georgia, his elbow had just been surgically rebuilt, every move of his personal life became social-media fodder and he knew the doubters were everywhere.\n\nHe almost got the last laugh. Beck started all 16 games for Miami, led the Hurricanes to a 13-3 mark and set a school record by completing 72.4% of his passes. The last pass was a bit underthrown, and there seemed to be some sort of miscommunication on the final play. (“Their defense played really well tonight,\" Beck said.) But Miami knew long before that play that without Beck, they wouldn't have gotten anywhere near the CFP title game.\n\n“He earned the respect of his teammates, teammates working hard with him,” Miami coach Mario Cristobal said. “We win together, we lose together. Proud of him.”\n\nBeck was at Miami for one year. He made clear after his final college game that whatever the future brings, he'll have the Hurricanes to thank.\n\n“I really couldn’t have done it without all these people around me,” Beck said. “This university truly saved me and helped me rebuild into the man that I am today.”\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "fullText": "After knocking down a barrage of 3-pointers in their blowout win over the Charlotte Hornets on Saturday night, the Golden State Warriors picked up right where they left off on Monday evening with the Miami Heat in town.\n\nLed by former Heat All-Star forward Jimmy Butler, the Warriors came out swinging. Butler tallied 13 first-quarter points to lead the Warriors to a 36-34 lead in the opening frame. Despite Butler's early run, the Heat didn't go away, thanks to former Warrior Andrew Wiggins.\n\nIn his first game back at Chase Center since being traded at the deadline last year, Wiggins tallied 18 first-half points against his former team. With Butler and Wiggins trading buckets, the Warriors were able to cling to a four-point advantage at the first half whistle.\n\nIn the third quarter, Chase Center went quiet as Butler appeared to suffer a knee injury. Butler landed awkwardly on his right knee and went to the ground in pain. Butler exited the game and went to the locker room before being ruled out for the remainder of the game with a right knee injury. After the game, the Warriors revealed that Butler is undergoing an MRI on his knee.\n\nFollowing Butler's injury, the Warriors picked up their teammate with a game-swinging run. At the time of Butler's injury, the Warriors held a two-point lead with under eight minutes remaining in the third quarter.\n\nThe Warriors went on a 12-0 run to take a commanding 15-point lead. Behind their third-quarter run and Brandin Podziemski's fiery finish to the game, the Warriors were able to pull away for a 135-112 win.\n\nPodziemski led the Warriors with 24 points on 9-of-19 shooting from the field with a trio of 3-pointers to go along with six boards and four assists in 30 minutes off the bench. Podziemski scored 17 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter.\n\nAlong with Podziemski and Butler, the Warriors had five other players tally double-figure scoring numbers on Monday. Six different players hit two or more 3-pointers against the Heat for 24 made 3-pointers. The Warriors have now drilled 20 or more 3-pointers in their last four games.\n\nThe Warriors have now posted a 6-1 record during their eight-game homestand. The Warriors will wrap up their homestand on Tuesday on the second leg of a back-to-back against the Raptors.\n\nThis post originally appeared on Warriors Wire! \n\nThis article originally appeared on Warriors Wire: Warriors pull away from Heat for fourth straight win, 135-112",

    "description": "MIAMI GARDENS — The No. 10 Hurricanes weren’t routed as Alabama and Oregon were.",
    "fullText": "MIAMI GARDENS — The No. 10 Hurricanes weren’t routed as Alabama and Oregon were.\n\nBut for more than half of Monday night’s College Football Playoff title game, they were suffocated.\n\nAnd then, as they shed their offensive struggles, the Hurricanes were outlasted, 27-21, by an Indiana Hoosiers team that delivered one championship-worthy moment after another.\n\nIn his highly-anticipated homecoming, quarterback Fernando Mendoza was not as prolific as he had been in the No. 1 Hoosiers’ two previous playoff victories. The Heisman Trophy winner threw as many incompletions in Monday’s first half as he had in those previous wins. Mendoza was battered and, at one point, even bloodied by a violent Hurricanes defense.\n\nBut in the game’s deciding moments, he was as Heisman-worthy as ever.\n\nFaced with a fourth and 4 in the fourth quarter, Indiana (16-0) decided against a short field-goal attempt from the Miami 12 that would have extended their lead to six.\n\nThey instead kept the ball in Mendoza’s hands, dialing up a quarterback draw that brilliantly negated Miami’s pass rush and Hoosiers history will never forget. Mendoza ran for first-down yardage, spun his way out of a tackle and dove for the end zone with a Superman-esque leap.\n\nThe way Miami (13-3) was suddenly moving the ball downfield, Indiana might not have capped off a perfect season with the program’s first national championship in football.\n\nTwo Charlie Becker receptions were pivotal, too. The first came on a fourth and 5 before Mendoza’s touchdown run, the second on a third and 7 on Indiana’s ensuing offensive possession. Despite being blanketed in coverage, Becker conjured up two extraordinary catches.\n\nUltimately, the morale of this brutal loss for Miami is that against a team like Indiana, any misstep, or even the slightest flinch, is magnified.\n\nThe first punt blocked for a touchdown in College Football Playoff history becomes insurmountable.\n\nAlex Bauman missed his blocking assignment, Mikail Kamara blocked the kick, and Isaiah Jones pounced on it for a third-quarter touchdown, delivering a crushing blow the Hurricanes’ second-half surge.\n\nRueben Bain Jr.’s second-quarter offside penalty provided more proof of this phenomenon. Bain played a magnificent game, as the presumptive NFL draft declarant did many times in a Miami uniform.\n\nBut with Indiana facing a third and 12, he jumped offside, negating an incompletion that was set to produce a Hoosier punt. Indiana converted its second chance at the down and went on to cap off a 15-play scoring drive with a Riley Nowakowski touchdown run that put Curt Cignetti’s team ahead 10-0.\n\nBain, or even Bauman for that matter, should not blamed for Monday’s loss.\n\nBain led Miami’s honorable defensive performance as the unit suffocated Indiana plenty itself. He had 2.5 tackles for loss, and Akheem Mesidor added two. Even against a formidable Indiana offensive line, the duo was menacing.\n\nThey also sacked Mendoza three times, and forced him to run for his life in the backfield plenty of other times as the Hoosiers’ offensive machine produced only a fraction of the 56 and 38 points it scored in its previous two games.\n\nBut Miami paid for playing with an offense that did not convert a third down until less than three minutes remained in the third quarter.\n\nThat again saw their field-goal kicker nail an upright.\n\nThat without a Mark Fletcher Jr. 57-yard touchdown run, produced only 53 rushing yards after gashing their previous playoff opponents.\n\nWhose quarterback, as a threatening last-second drive was building, badly overthrew a receiver on a play the Hurricanes did not need to bank their entire season on.\n\nMake no mistake: This was a fantastic Hurricanes team.\n\n“I couldn’t be more proud to be associated with them,” Head Coach Mario Cristobal said. “I love them.”\n\n“They had the guts, the faith and the trust to look at a place that was a complete mess and say ‘I’m gonna be a man of action. I’m gonna make the University of Miami a prominent program once again.’”\n\nThe Hurricanes somehow ended the game with more yards than the Hoosiers after finishing the first half with only 69 yards from scrimmage.\n\nThey went from on the bubble to the championship game, making football feel special in South Florida for the first time in more than two decades.\n\nThroughout it all, the Hurricanes operated with a flair for the dramatic. They made pivotal mistakes, but found a way to not pay for them. On Monday, they finally did.\n\nCurt Cignetti’s Hoosiers don’t forgive, and because of that, they are champions.\n\nEvery weekday, tune into our Sports Day Tampa Bay podcast to hear reporter Rick Stroud break down the biggest stories in Tampa Bay sports.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

    "title": "Is Dan Neil’s “Long Goodbye” Set To Reach Its Conclusion?",
    "description": "“Given all he’s done for this club, the passage of time should be very, very kind to his legacy on Wearside”",
    "fullText": "At around 2:30pm on Saturday, the sight of Dan Neil going through his warm-up routines as the players got themselves ready ahead of kick off against Crystal Palace caught my eye.\n\nAs the Lads executed their drills, he and Chris Rigg spent a good deal of time passing the ball back and forth, their exchanges punctuated by what appeared to be some good-natured banter, plenty of smiles and the kind of larking about you’d expect from two Sunderland lads who were living the dream of being involved with their boyhood club at the highest level.\n\nHowever, despite the good vibes, it also felt poignant. Was I watching a player for whom this was possibly his final appearance in either a playing or non-playing capacity in front of the Stadium of Light crowd?\n\nTo most fans, I suspect the sight of two academy products sharing a pitch with the likes of Granit Xhaka and Nordi Mukiele is surely a source of real pride and perhaps the most shining example of how our youth development programme has gone from strength to strength.\n\nHowever, whereas Rigg looks set for what we all hope will be a long and productive Sunderland career, Neil — almost six years his senior and already a veteran of over two hundred appearances in the red and white — seems set to embark upon a new chapter of his career, one that’ll see him bid farewell to the only club he’s ever called home.\n\nMedia rumours have been plentiful, with the likes of Sheffield United, Rangers, West Ham, FC Köln and Borussia Mönchengladbach credited with an interest in the homegrown midfielder.\n\nAll interesting options — and a move to one of the two German clubs would be the real adventurous choice, for me — but it’s testament to Neil’s pedigree that he’s caught the eye of scouts at home and overseas, and I’m not at all surprised that that his services are in demand.\n\nAs those who take the time to read my ramblings on the pages of Roker Report and on X will know, my stance on Neil is no secret: I’ve been a huge fan of him for a long time and I’ve always believed that his talent and the role he played in the process that eventually led us from the depths of League One to the bright lights and big cities of the Premier League shouldn’t go unappreciated.\n\nHe’s never been a “liability”. He’s also never been a weak link and I’ll defend to the nth degree his right not to put pen to paper on a new contract if he felt that, for whatever reason, it wasn’t right.\n\nTwo promotions, plenty of hugely influential performances and a wholehearted and committed approach to the game represents a very stellar return and regardless of whether you agreed with the decision to appoint him as captain or questioned his credentials for that role, his status as the first homegrown Sunderland player to skipper his side to Wembley success since Raich Carter is something that nobody can ever take away from him.\n\nHowever, whatever’s gone on behind the scenes — and it must be stressed that Régis Le Bris has been nothing but steadfast in his support for Neil — the contrast impasse that seems to have been simmering away for some time appears to have reached its endgame.\n\nThe phrase “the club has evolved very quickly” has regularly been in circulation since the summer and given the high-class options currently at our disposal, Neil has increasingly found himself on the fringes as his apparent exit has drawn nearer.\n\nIt should never be a joyous turn of events when a homegrown player departs, but if we want Sunderland AFC to be run efficiently, to maintain a ruthless focus on continued progress and to continue to unlock the vast potential contained within, the tough decisions can’t be shirked and that’s just the way it is.\n\nI firmly believe that Neil does have the talent to make it at this level, so it does sting somewhat to have to accept that he’ll seemingly be plying his trade elsewhere, yet on the other hand — in my eyes at least — he’ll hopefully leave in similar fashion to Jack Clarke, having retained his professionalism right to the very end and not disrupted the chemistry of the squad as he seeks clarity on his future.\n\nSome fans may feel that he’s looked “disconnected” in recent weeks and months (that would be understandable, as the apparently imminent end of any love affair isn’t something to which you’d turn cartwheels in response and if Neil is feeling saddened, it’s a totally human reaction) but I’ve always felt that much of the criticism directed towards him is borne of envy — envy of a player who’s lived all our dreams through one of the most transformative periods in the club’s history and who was at the heart of some truly iconic moments.\n\nWhatever the future holds for him and wherever he lands next, Neil will always be one of our own.\n\nIf we happen to cross paths with him somewhere down the road, I really hope his efforts in a red and white shirt are acknowledged and I’m sure that given all he’s done for this club, the passage of time should be very, very kind to his legacy on Wearside.",

    "fullText": "MIAMI GARDENS — The field was covered in red-and-white confetti, and the Heisman Trophy quarterback was covered in bruises. The college football season had just come down to the very final minute, and a team of perpetual sorrow was dancing toward glory.\n\nThis is what it looks like when reality surpasses fantasy.\n\nNo. 1 Indiana, emerging from a century of gloom, won the College Football Playoff national championship game, 27-21, against No. 10 Miami on Monday night in what feels like a seismic shift in possibilities for forgotten programs everywhere.\n\nWere they watching Monday night in Starkville, Mississippi?\n\nHow about in Ames, Iowa? Maybe even in the shadow of a new campus stadium in Tampa?\n\n“We’re 16-0 and national champions at Indiana University,” head coach Curt Cignetti said. “I know a lot of people thought that was never possible. It’s probably one of the greatest sports stories of all time.”\n\nThe Hoosiers, a team that had not won a conference championship in nearly 60 years and was more than 200 games below .500 before Cignetti arrived in 2024, went 16-0 and won the national championship just two years after going 3-9. If that kind of turnaround is possible in the new world of college football, can any dream be considered too outlandish in the days to come?\n\nQuarterback Fernando Mendoza, who grew up just miles from Hard Rock Stadium and was all but ignored by his beloved University of Miami as a Columbus High senior, played a virtually flawless game despite a fierce pass rush from the Hurricanes.\n\n“Tonight is going to be an insane night,” Mendoza said during the onfield trophy presentation. “I can’t wait to get back to Bloomington with the guys.”\n\nThere was nothing accidental about what Indiana accomplished this season. The record was perfect, and it was absolutely a reflection of the team’s play.\n\nThe Hoosiers were disciplined (fifth in the nation in penalties per game), they were explosive (second in points per game), they were stingy (second in points allowed per game) and they were smart (first in turnover margin).\n\nThey beat defending national champion Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game, and then crushed Alabama and Oregon by a combined 94-25 in their first two playoff games. All that stood in Indiana’s way was a Miami team that defied projections with upsets of higher-seeded teams in the first two rounds of the playoffs before dispatching Ole Miss in the semifinals.\n\nThe Hoosiers controlled the ball and frustrated the Hurricanes in the first half, and then came up with clutch plays on offense and special teams in the second half as Miami staged a furious comeback.\n\nAnd, in the end, Indiana’s fearlessness was the difference.\n\nAfter Miami had cut the lead to 17-14, the Hoosiers answered with a touchdown drive for the ages. It wasn’t that they held the ball for 12 plays or that they traveled 75 yards. It was that Cignetti put faith in his quarterback on a fourth and 5 instead of punting from the Miami 37, and then again on fourth down from the Miami 4. On the first conversion, Mendoza hit Charlie Becker on a 19-yard, back-shoulder completion. That was just the appetizer.\n\nOn fourth down from the 4, Indiana initially called the field-goal unit on the field. After a timeout, Cignetti sent the offense back out and Mendoza, on a quarterback draw, bounced off defenders and dove into the endzone for the touchdown.\n\n“They called that play and we knew, ‘Hey, we’re going to bet on ourselves one more time in the biggest (moment) of the game,’” Mendoza said.\n\nIn a way, this is what so many fans wanted. A college football postseason with the suspense of an NCAA basketball tournament.\n\nAlabama, Clemson, Georgia and Ohio State had become as ubiquitous in January as Dick Clark and Times Square. From 2014-22, there was not a single national championship game without at least one of those teams. And six of those games included some variation of two of those programs playing each other.\n\nThat’s the hierarchy the transfer portal torched. And this is the future that name, image and likeness money has begat.\n\nMiami, on Monday night, was playing in a national title game for the first time in 23 years. The last time Indiana had even a whiff of national title consideration was when the Hoosiers lost 14-3 to No. 1 USC in the 1968 Rose Bowl and finished No. 4 in the final Associated Press poll.\n\nIt’s a new era of college football.\n\nIt’s not perfect, by any means. It’s not beloved by traditionalists aghast with players jumping from school to school, and it’s practically blasphemous for programs accustomed to sitting atop the mountaintop.\n\nBut, as the 2025 season demonstrated, there is something exhilarating about the unknown. Something thrilling about new faces and stories.\n\nSomething remarkable about a program that could endure 26 losing seasons in 30 years and, with a new coach on board, emerge to go 27-2 across his first two seasons and win a national championship.\n\nWelcome to the new world order.\n\nJohn Romano can be reached at jromano@tampabay.com.

    "description": "The Washington Commanders and head coach Dan Quinn made another bold move, promoting Darnell Stapleton to offensive line coach.",
    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders made a bold move on Monday, promoting assistant offensive line coach Darnell Stapleton to offensive line coach. This comes less than two weeks after head coach Dan Quinn promoted assistant quarterbacks coach David Blough to offensive coordinator.\n\nWhy is this a bold move? Blough had only two years of coaching experience when he was promoted. While many around the NFL, including everyone in Washington's building, believe the former NFL quarterback is a future coaching star, the 30-year-old had led only a position group for a couple of weeks late in the 2025 season, after Tavita Pritchard left to become Stanford's head coach.\n\nMany believed that after firing offensive line coach Bobby Johnson and parting ways with offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury, the Commanders would look to bring in an experienced voice for Blough. Last week, Blough also hired former college teammate Danny Etling as the assistant quarterbacks coach, after hiring D.J. Williams to be the new quarterbacks coach.\n\nWashington reportedly likes Stapleton's ability to develop players, and he received internal praise for first-round pick Josh Conerly's growth as a rookie in 2025. Stapleton and Blough worked together as assistant position coaches and are said to have a strong rapport.\n\nWill this work for Washington? Only time will tell. Quinn is betting his future on it.\n\nHow did everyone receive the news that the Commanders promoted another young assistant coach? We surveyed some of the top reactions via X.\n\nMentioned Stapleton the other day on the podcast as a good possibility. Good rapport with the OL and was heavily involved in protection schemes and other aspects of the O. Aligned with Blough’s vision. https://t.co/LCBF5U1GXz\n\n— John Keim (@john_keim) January 19, 2026\n\nThe moves make sense in a lot of ways. Stapleton has a good rapport with OC David Blough, is well-liked by players and was involved in game planning and protection plans last season. https://t.co/6tKA0tCnuN\n\n— Nicki Jhabvala (@NickiJhabvala) January 19, 2026\n\nDan Quinn disliked the offense enough to part with Kliff Kingsbury & Bobby Johnson but liked the offense enough to promote David Blough, Darnell Stapleton & Shane Toub.\n\nNot saying any of this is wrong (there's a lot we don't know), but this is an unusual offensive-staff revamp.\n\n— Al Galdi (@AlGaldi) January 19, 2026\n\nWith Stapleton being promoted, I think we're about to see the Commanders become a much more zone-based run team. Will be interesting to see if they get under center more or lean more on the pistol\n\n— Mark Bullock (@MarkBullockNFL) January 19, 2026\n\nStapleton has been an OL coach in college & played in the pros\n\nToub has been working with OL as a QC coach, & was the team captain of his team at Dayton as a Center.\n\nBoth have OL credentials certainly, still feels odd team’s leaning so heavy on limited experience in the roles https://t.co/cvWopL4LXH\n\n— T “Resh” Manuel (@reshmanuel) January 19, 2026\n\nThis is an educated guess. Stapleton was part of zone team in college. Commanders OL is super athletic and suited to zone, so are the RBs & TEs.\n\nAlso, the briefing on Stapleton was \"involved in protection plans\", not run game. Run game under Kliff/Johnson was heavy gap scheme\n\n— Mark Bullock (@MarkBullockNFL) January 19, 2026\n\nThe #Commanders will essentially be rolling out the same offensive coaching staff MINUS Kliff Kingsbury and Tavita Pritchard.\n\nOn one hand, continuity is king for a young QB.\n\nOn the other, somewhat uninspiring hires with a cycle of good coaches out. 🤔#RaiseHail https://t.co/yOMYFuGhPa\n\n— George Carmi (@Gcarmi21) January 19, 2026\n\nYeah…. Just seems odd to promote the assistants under the guys that were let go and hoping for a more desirable outcome. pic.twitter.com/B3Y6GWhlnw\n\n— Filterle$$ 🗣🤌🏻🎙 (@tambascosauce69) January 19, 2026\n\nDarnell Stapleton will get a up close look at the OL on the National side in the senior bowl — pretty excited about that.\n\n— Cornelius Kidwell (@ExcuseTheHebrew) January 19, 2026\n\ncurious. https://t.co/dVAFS9ffMb\n\n— Nate Tice (@Nate_Tice) January 19, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Fans, others react to Darnell Stapleton move",

    "fullText": "Carson Beck will have plenty of fond memories to look back on from his college football career.\n\nBut it ended Monday in heartbreak.\n\nWith a chance to lead Miami on a drive for its sixth national championship, Beck threw an interception that sealed Indiana's first. His intended target on the play, Keelan Marion, never saw the ball in the air.\n\nWith the clock ticking under two minutes, Miami's defense held Indiana to a field goal that gave the Hoosiers a 27-21 lead. Beck then led the offense onto the field with 1:42 remaining, in need of a touchdown that could seal a national title on Miami's home field.\n\nMiami overcame a delay of game penalty before the first snap with a pair of first downs that put them over midfield. The first first down of the drive arrived courtesy of a roughing the passer penalty that resulted in the back of Beck's head hitting the turf.\n\nWith the Hurricanes facing first and 10 at the Indiana 41, Beck decided to go for it all with 51 seconds remaining. Marion ran a go route down the left sideline, facing man coverage from cornerback Jamari Sharpe and safety help over the top.\n\nBeck launched a deep ball that never stood a chance.\n\njamari sharpe game sealing interception; miami vs indiana pic.twitter.com/ceKYojVw14\n\n— ◇ (@F0RGIAT0) January 20, 2026\n\nThe ball was short and thrown into double coverage. Sharpe pinpointed it for an interception at the 15-yard line as Marion continued to run toward the end zone.\n\nWith Miami out of timeouts, all that was left for the Hoosiers to clinch the national championship was to run out the clock. They did just that for a 27-21 win.\n\nAnd Beck will finish his college career with two national championships as a backup at Georgia, but none as a starter.\n\nThe turnover was the first of the night for either team on a night when Beck completed 19 of 32 passes for 232 yards with 1 touchdown and the late interception.\n\nBeck was asked after the game how he was feeling on the last drive after the roughing-the-passer hit.\n\n\"My ears are ringing,\" Beck said, per ESPN's Pete Thamel.\n\nBeck also spoke with reporters about the game-sealing interception.\n\nHere’s Carson Beck explaining the final interception. pic.twitter.com/COIrwqYO4C\n\n— Clay Ferraro (@ClayWPLG) January 20, 2026\n\n\"The guy made a really good play,\" Beck said. \"They were in cover 2 and he sunk with no flat threat, made a really good play on the ball.\n\n\"So again, a lot of credit to them and their defense. They played really, really well tonight.\"\n\nPer Thamel, Marion was in tears in the postgame locker room with a towel over his head. He said that the interception was his \"mistake\" and that he didn't realize that Beck had thrown the pass.\n\n\"I didn't even know he had threw the ball,\" Marion said. ... “I got to look for the ball and make that play for him. So that's all on me.”\n\nHere's a look at the Marion's route from the sideline near the end zone. Marion didn't look back for the ball until he crossed the 20-yard line after Sharpe had made his break on the ball. By then, it was too late.\n\nI see what Carson Beck saw here. Why is Keelan Marion running with his head down? I really don’t understand. pic.twitter.com/XopqjBbpVp\n\n— Miami Hurricanes 2026 National Champs 🏆 (@nijayforeverlit) January 20, 2026\n\nThe interception concludes a college career for Beck that started at Georgia in 2020 and featured five seasons including a redshirt campaign with the Bulldogs before he utilized his extra Covid-19 season to transfer to Miami.\n\nMiami didn't win the ACC with Beck at quarterback, but was granted a controversial berth in the College Football Playoff. Beck and the Hurricanes ultimately proved the selection committee correct by winning three playoff games to advance to Monday's championship game.\n\nThey had a chance at the end to upset a historic Indiana team that surged to the top of college football with dominant units on both sides of the ball following decades of irrelevance.\n\nIt's a lot to be proud of. But it's not likely to soothe the pain of how Monday's championship game was lost at the end.",

    "description": "A real-world comparison of GPT-5.2-Codex (high), Claude Opus 4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro on two coding tasks, focusing on quality, speed, and cost.",
    "fullText": "If you want a quick take: Claude Opus 4.5 was the most consistent, GPT-5.2-codex (high) delivered strong code with slower turnaround, and Gemini 3 Pro was the most efficient but less polished.\n\nIf you want a quick take, here’s how the three models performed in our tests:\n\n💡 If you want the safest pick for real “ship a feature in a big repo” work, Opus 4.5 felt the most reliable in my runs. If you care about speed and cost and you’re okay polishing UI yourself, Gemini 3 Pro is a solid bet.\n\nOkay, so right now the WebDev leaderboard on LMArena is basically owned by the big three: Claude Opus 4.5 from Anthropic, GPT-5.2-codex (high) from OpenAI, and finally everybody's favorite, Gemini 3 Pro from Google.\n\nSo, I grabbed these three and put them into the same existing project (over 8K stars and 50K+ LOC) and asked them to build a couple of real features like a normal dev would.\n\nSame repo. Same prompts. Same constraints.\n\nFor each task, I took the best result out of three runs per model to keep things fair.\n\nThen I compared what they actually did: code quality, how much hand-holding they needed, and whether the feature even worked in the end.\n\n⚠️ NOTE: Don't take the result of this test as a hard rule. This is just a small set of real-world coding tasks that shows how each model did for me in that exact setup and gives you an overview of the difference in the top 3 models' performance in the same tasks.\n\nFor the test, we will use the following CLI coding agents:\n\nHere’s the repo used for the entire test: iib0011/omni-tools\n\nWe will check the models on two different tasks:\n\nEach model is asked to create a global action menu that opens with a keyboard shortcut. This feature expands on the current search by adding actions, global state, and keyboard navigation. This task checks how well the model understands current UX patterns and avoids repetition without breaking what's already in place.\n\nEach model had to add real usage tracking across the app, persist it locally, and then build an analytics dashboard that shows things like the most used tools, recent activity, and basic filters.\n\nWe’ll compare code quality, token usage, cost, and time to complete the build.\n\n💡 NOTE: I will share the source code changes for each task by each model in a .patch file. This way, you can easily view them on your local system by cloning the repository and applying the patch file using git apply <path_file_name>. This method makes sharing changes easier.\n\nThe task is simple: all models start from the same base commit and then follow the same prompt to build what is asked in the prompt.\n\nAnd obviously, as mentioned, I will evaluate the response from the model from the \"Best of 3.\"\n\nLet's start off the test with something interesting:\n\nGPT-5.2 handled this surprisingly well. The implementation was solid end to end, and it basically one-shotted the entire feature set, including i18n support, without needing multiple correction passes.\n\nThat said, it did take a bit longer than some other models (~20 minutes), which is expected since reasoning was explicitly set to high. The model spends more time thinking through architecture, naming, and edge cases rather than rushing to output code. The trade-off felt worth it here.\n\nThe token usage was noticeably higher due to the reasoning set to high, but the output code reflected that.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: GPT-5.2 High Code\n\n💡 NOTE: I ran the exact same prompt with the same model using the default (medium) reasoning level. The difference was honestly massive. With reasoning set to high, the quality of the code, structure, and pretty much everything jumps by miles. It’s not even a fair comparison.\n\nClaude went all in and prepared a ton of different strategies. At the start, it did run into build issues, but it kept running the build until it was able to fix all the build and lint issues.\n\nThe entire run took me about 7 minutes 50 seconds, which is the fastest among the models for this test. The features all worked as asked, and obviously, the UI looked super nice and exactly how I expected.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Claude Opus 4.5 Code\n\nTo be honest, this exceeded my expectations; even the i18n texts are added and displayed in the UI just as expected. Absolute cinema!\n\nGemini 3 got it working, but it's clearly not on the same level as GPT-5.2 High or Claude Opus 4.5. The UI it built is fine and totally usable, but it feels a bit barebones, and you don't get many choices in the palette compared to the other two.\n\nOne clear miss is that language switching does not show up inside the action palette at all, which makes the i18n support feel incomplete even though translations technically exist.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Gemini 3 Pro Code\n\nOverall, Gemini 3 lands in a very clear third place here. It works, the UI looks fine, and nothing is completely broken, but compared to the depth, completeness, and polish of GPT-5.2 High and Claude Opus 4.5, it feels behind.\n\nThis test is a step up from the action palette.\n\nYou can find the prompt I've used here: Prompt\n\nGPT-5.2 absolutely nailed this one.\n\nThe final result turned out amazing. Tool usage tracking works exactly as expected, data persists correctly, and the dashboard feels like a real product feature. Most used tools, recent usage, filters, everything just works.\n\nOne really nice touch is that it also wired analytics-related actions into the Action Palette from Test 1.\n\nIt did take a bit longer than the first test, around 26 minutes, but again, that’s the trade-off with high reasoning. You can tell the model spent time thinking through data modeling, reuse, and avoiding duplicated logic. Totally worth it here.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: GPT-5.2 High Code\n\nGPT-5.2 High continues to be slow but extremely powerful, and for a task like this, that’s a very good trade.\n\nClaude Opus 4.5 did great here as well.\n\nThe final implementation works end to end, and honestly, from a pure UI and feature standpoint, it’s hard to tell the difference between this and GPT-5.2 High. The dashboard looks clean, the data makes sense, and the filters work as expected.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Claude Opus 4.5 Code\n\nGemini 3 Pro gets the job done, but it clearly takes a more minimal approach compared to GPT-5.2 High and Claude Opus 4.5.\n\nThat said, the overall experience feels very bare minimum. The UI is functional but plain, and the dashboard lacks the polish and depth you get from the other two models.\n\nAlso, it didn't quite add the button to view the analytics right in the action palette, similar to the other two models.\n\nYou can find the code it generated here: Gemini 3 Pro Code\n\nOverall, Gemini 3 Pro remains efficient and reliable, but in a comparison like this, efficiency alone is not enough. 🤷‍♂️\n\nAt least from this test, I can conclude that the models are now pretty much able to one-shot a decent complex work, at least from what I tested.\n\nStill, there have been times when the models mess up so badly that if I were to go ahead and fix the problems one by one, it would take me nearly the same time as building it from scratch.\n\nIf I compare the results across models, Opus 4.5 definitely takes the crown. But I still don’t think we’re anywhere close to relying on it for real, big production projects. The recent improvements are honestly insane, but the results still don’t fully back them up. 🥴\n\nFor now, I think these models are great for refactoring, planning, and helping you move faster. But if you solely rely on their generated code, the codebase just won’t hold up long term.\n\nI don't see any of these recent models as “use it and ship it” for \"production,\" in a project with millions of lines of code, at least not in the way people hype it up.\n\nLet me know your thoughts in the comments.\n\nSoftware and DevOps engineer with 4+ years of experience building for the web and cloud, mainly with TypeScript, Python, Go, Docker, and Kubernetes.

He was 76.\n\nThe cause of death was pneumonia, his daughter Camilla Christie said.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa paid tribute to Dr. Christie after his death, saying his “relentless and fearless commitment to our freedom demands our appreciation.”\n\nThe A.N.C., in a statement, called Dr. Christie’s role “in disrupting and exposing the apartheid state’s clandestine nuclear weapons program” an “act of profound revolutionary significance.”\n\nFrom the doctoral dissertation he had written at the University of Oxford on the history of electricity in South Africa, Dr. Christie provided the research needed to blow up the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station; the Arnot coal-fired power station; the Sasol oil-from-coal facilities that produced the heavy water critical to producing nuclear weapons; and other critical sites.\n\nThe explosions set back South Africa’s nascent nuclear weapons program by years and cost the government more than $1 billion, Dr. Christie later estimated.\n\n“While I was in prison, everything I had ever researched was blown up,” he said in a speech in 2023.\n\nTerrorism was a capital offense, and Dr. Christie narrowly escaped hanging. But as he later recounted, he was deliberately placed on the death row closest to the gallows at the Pretoria Maximum Security Prison. For two and half years, he was forced to listen to the hangings of more than 300 prisoners.\n\n“The whole prison would sing for two or three days before the hanging, to ease the terror of the victims,” Dr. Christie recalled at a 2013 conference at the University of the Western Cape on laws regarding torture.\n\nThen he recited the lyrics of an anti‐apartheid folk song that reverberated in the penitentiary: “‘Senzeni-na? Senzeni-na? What have we done? What have we done?’ It was the most beautiful music on earth, sung in a vile place.”\n\n“At zero dark hundred,” he continued, “the hanging party would come through the corridors to the gallows, slamming the gates behind them on the road to death. Once they were at the gallows there was a long pause. Then — crack! — the trapdoors would open, and the neck or necks of the condemned would snap. A bit later came the hammering, presumably of nails into the coffins.”\n\nIn an interview years later with the BBC, he said the “gruesome” experience affected him for the rest of his life.\n\nDr. Christie acquired his fierce antipathy to apartheid at a young age, growing up in an impoverished family in Johannesburg.\n\nMany of his family members fought with the Allied forces against the Germans in World War II, and “I learned from them very early that what one does with Nazis is kill them,” he said at a 2023 conference on antinuclear activism in Johannesburg. “I am not a pacifist.”\n\nAt 17, he was drafted into the South African Army. A stint of guard duty at the Lenz ammunition dump south of Johannesburg confirmed his suspicions that the government was building nuclear weapons. “From the age of 17, I was hunting the South African bomb,” he said at the conference.\n\nAfter attending the University of the Witwatersrand, he received a scholarship to Oxford, which enabled him to further his quest. For his doctoral dissertation, he chose to study South Africa’s history of electrification, “so I could get into the electricity supply commission’s library and archives, and work out how much electricity they were using to enrich uranium,” he told the BBC.\n\nFrom there, it was possible to calculate how many nuclear bombs could be produced. Six such bombs had reportedly been made by the end of apartheid in the early 1990s; the United States had initially aided the regime’s nuclear program. Thanks to the system of forced labor, South Africa “made the cheapest electricity in the world,” Dr. Christie said, which aided the process of uranium enrichment and made the country’s nuclear program a magnet for Western support. (South Africa also benefited from its status as a Cold War ally against the Soviet Union.)\n\nDr. Christie turned his findings over to the A.N.C. Instead of opting for the safety of England — there was the possibility of a lecturer position at Oxford — he returned home and was arrested by South Africa’s Security Police. He had been betrayed by Craig Williamson, a fellow student at Witwatersrand, who had become a spy for the security services and was later granted amnesty by South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\n\nAfter 48 hours of torture, Dr. Christie wrote a forced confession — “the best thing I ever wrote,” he later told the BBC, noting that he had made sure the confession included “all my recommendations to the African National Congress” about the best way to sabotage Koeberg and other facilities.\n\n“And, gloriously, the judge read it out in court,” Dr. Christie added. “So my recommendations went from the judge’s mouth” straight to the A.N.C.\n\nTwo years later, in December 1982, Koeberg was bombed by white A.N.C. operatives who had gotten jobs at the facility. They followed Dr. Christie’s instructions to the letter.\n\n“Of all the achievements of the armed struggle, the bombing of Koeberg is there,” Dr. Christie said at the 2023 conference, emphasizing its importance. “Frankly, when I got to hearing of it, it made being in prison much, much easier to tolerate.”\n\nRenfrew Leslie Christie was born in Johannesburg on Sept. 11, 1949, the only child of Frederick Christie, an accountant, and Lindsay (Taylor) Christie, who was soon widowed and raised her son alone while working as a secretary.\n\nHe attended King Edward VII School in Johannesburg and was conscripted into the army immediately after graduating. After his discharge, he enrolled at Witwatersrand. He was twice arrested after illegally visiting Black students at the University of the North at Turfloop, and was also arrested during a march on a police station where he said the anti-apartheid activist Winnie Mandela was being tortured.\n\nHe didn’t finish the course at Witwatersrand, instead earning bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the University of Cape Town in the mid-1970s before studying at Oxford. At Cape Town, he was a leader of the National Union of South African Students, an important anti-apartheid organization.\n\nOn June 6, 1980, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison under South Africa’s Terrorism Act, with four other sentences of five years each to run concurrently.\n\n“I spent seven months in solitary,” Dr. Christie said in the 2023 speech. “Don’t let anybody kid you: No one comes out of solitary sane. My nightmares are awful.”\n\nAfter his years in prison, he was granted amnesty in 1986 as the apartheid regime began to crumble. (It officially ended in 1994, when Nelson Mandela became the country’s first Black president.) He later had a long academic career at the University of the Western Cape, retiring in 2014 as dean of research and senior professor.\n\nIn addition to his daughter Camilla, he is survived by his wife, Dr. Menán du Plessis, a linguist and novelist he married in 1990; and another daughter, Aurora.\n\nAsked by the BBC whether he was glad he had spied for the A.N.C., Dr. Christie didn’t hesitate.\n\n“I was working for Nelson Mandela and uMkonto we Sizwe,” he said. “I’m very proud of that. We won. We got a democracy.”\n\nKirsten Noyes contributed research.",

    "fullText": "Sometimes science can be painfully slow. Data comes in dribs and drabs, truth trickles, and veracity proves viscous.\n\nThe world's longest-running lab experiment is an ongoing work in sheer scientific patience. It has been running continuously for nearly a century, under the close supervision of several custodians and many spectators – and it's ever so slowly drip, drip, dripping away.\n\nIt all started in 1927, when physicist Thomas Parnell at the University of Queensland in Australia filled a closed funnel with the world's thickest known fluid: pitch, a derivative of tar that was once used to seal ships against the seas.\n\nThree years later, in 1930, Parnell cut the funnel's stem, like a ribbon at an event, heralding the start of the Pitch Drop Experiment. From then on, the black substance began to flow.\n\nAt least, that is, in a manner of speaking. At room temperature pitch might look solid, but it is actually a fluid 100 billion times more viscous than water.\n\nIt took eight years for the first droplet to finally hit the beaker below. Then, they dripped at a cadence of once every eight years or so, slowing down only after air conditioning was installed in the building in the 1980s.\n\nToday, 96 years after the funnel was cut, only nine drops in total have seeped out. The last was in 2014.\n\nScientists expect another will fall sometime in the 2020s, but they are still waiting.\n\nNo one has ever actually seen a droplet fall directly, despite all the watchful eyes. The experiment is now live-streamed, but various glitches in the past meant that each fateful moment has slipped us by.\n\nAfter Parnell, fellow physicist John Mainstone took over caretaking duties in 1961. Sadly, both died without ever seeing a droplet fall with their own two eyes.\n\nMainstone was custodian for 52 years. In 2000, he missed a drop because a thunderstorm disrupted the live feed. He passed away just a few months before the next drop oozed out in April 2014.\n\nPhysics professor Andrew White is the third and current custodian of the pitch drop experiment, keeping vigil for the long-awaited 10th drop.\n\nThe world's longest-running lab experiment has barely begun.",

    "description": "Au Hui Har and Liu Yi Wen fulfilled their dream of opening a cozy bakery in Singapore in July, after years of working in jobs that didn't suit them.",
    "fullText": "Ten minutes before The Weirdoughs opened its doors on a Friday morning, a queue of pastry-hungry customers had formed under its bright yellow awning.\n\nThe small bakery, located in a quiet residential neighborhood of Serangoon in Singapore, had fewer than 10 tables. But it was quickly packed with regulars buying coffees, sourdough bread, croissants, and brownies.\n\nI sat in a corner and people-watched, savoring the smell of espresso and The Weirdoughs' caramelized onion and leek pastry. It was the brainchild of cofounder Liu Yi Wen, a Taiwanese fine dining chef trained in French cuisine.\n\nLiu and her business partner, Au Hui Har, opened The Weirdoughs in July. The pair met while working at a local pastry business and decided to pool their savings to pursue a shared dream of starting something of their own.\n\nAbout five months on, business is booming, but baking close to a hundred loaves daily is not easy.\n\nLiu studied materials science in college.\n\n\"Studying materials science, that was the trend then. So I followed the trend, but I realized after I joined the course that I was not interested in it at all,\" Liu said.\n\nAfter graduating, she cut her culinary teeth at several upscale restaurants in Singapore, Paris, and Taiwan, including the three-Michelin-starred restaurant Joël Robuchon.\n\nShe described work in fine dining as akin to being in the army.\n\n\"The hours were very long, 14 to 16 hours daily. It was very normal for us to stay over,\" she said. \"And there was a strict hierarchy.\"\n\nShe returned to Singapore in 2022 to be with her partner, where she started working at Tarte by Cheryl Koh, a local pastry business.\n\nAu's pivot into baking, meanwhile, could not have been more drastic. She studied bioengineering in college and joined a management trainee program at the pharmaceutical company Novartis, completing rotations in Germany and Switzerland.\n\nLike Liu, Au also realized her day job wasn't what she wanted to do.\n\n\"Regulations in the industry take years to be implemented. I felt disconnected from the patients, and corporate life felt very tedious,\" Au said.\n\nWhen COVID-19 struck, Au returned to Singapore, seeking a job in the food and beverage industry. She joined Tarte, where she met Liu.\n\nLiu had a vision of opening a warm and homely café, similar to those she frequented in Taiwan and France.\n\nThe duo pooled about 100,000 Singapore dollars, or about $77,300, from their savings to purchase kitchen equipment, including large ovens and industrial mixers.\n\nTheir bakery, The Weirdoughs, opened its doors in July.\n\nAu and Liu brought their A-game to menu development.\n\n\"We wanted to incorporate Yi Wen's Taiwanese influence and techniques into our menu,\" Au said.\n\nTheir selection includes a tea egg sandwich, madeleines flavored with maqaw — a spice indigenous to Taiwan, and corn and miso sourdough.\n\nI was about to order a plain butter croissant when Au asked me if I was in the mood for something more adventurous. She recommended the caramelized onion and leek pastry. It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory — I still dream of it.\n\nI also tried their sourdough loaf with garam masala butter and a matcha cream-filled croissant.\n\nPatrons in the bakery told me it had quickly become their neighborhood go-to.\n\nI spoke to Foo Yong Howe, a public servant and a sourdough fan, who was sharing a sourdough loaf and cups of coffee with his brother. He said he visits the café often to have some quiet time to himself.\n\n\"If I had the time and my pocket could afford it, I would definitely come once a week,\" Foo, 51, said. \"Their sourdough is light and goes well with their homemade butters, and the space is really cozy.\"\n\nBusiness is booming, but that means more prep and earlier hours for the duo.\n\nAu starts baking their 26 varieties of pastries six hours before opening time, so that means getting in at 4 a.m. on most days. She wraps up baking the day's pastries before doors open at 10 a.m.\n\n\"It's definitely more tiring than I thought it would be,\" Au said.\n\nOn weekends, when the shop opens earlier at 8 a.m., she wakes up at 1 a.m.\n\n\"The biggest trouble we have is that since the space is so small, we can't really be turning on the oven when the shop is operating, otherwise it gets very hot,\" she said.\n\nThey get about 80 to 100 customers a day, and earn sales between SG$1,500 and SG$2,000 daily. The duo pays themselves a monthly salary of SG$2,000.\n\nTo try to maintain some semblance of a work-life balance and have a social life outside the café, Au said she just sleeps less: three to five hours a day.\n\n\"I'm not someone who lives life with regrets,\" she said. \"I always just go with the flow; everything is a learning process.\"",

    "description": "Gina Jaguttis shared how two solo trips to Bali led her to start her slow fashion business as a side hustle.",
    "fullText": "On a Monday morning in early December, I met Gina Jaguttis as we loaded our surfboards into the camp van just before sunrise. We only got to talking on a choppy boat ride that took us a mile off the coast of Bali, Indonesia.\n\nThe 26-year-old real estate project manager from Munich came to the surf camp to improve her skills on the water. I came to talk with adventurous travelers about their big ideas, from new businesses to life after layoffs.\n\nAt our camp's bonfire that night, she began to tell me why she made a second solo expedition to the tropical island. As we toasted marshmallows, she shared that she had launched a small side hustle a day before the bonfire.\n\nA few weeks after we got home, both recovering from sunburns and surf injuries, we unpacked her story further in a call. Our chats have been edited for length and clarity; the following is in Jaguttis' words.\n\nWhen I started my career a few years ago, I struggled to find formal clothes that looked professional and were good quality. Brands like Zara or Mango didn't meet my longevity standards, and I didn't love how they are mass-produced. Construction and real estate are male-dominated, and I always wanted to look well-dressed so others know that they have to treat me professionally.\n\nIn college, I was the girl who had a capsule wardrobe with pieces such as turtlenecks and cotton pants that I knew looked stylish then but also 10 years later. When I started work, it was frustrating to find well-fitted suits or blouses that were timeless and would last several years. On a trip to Bali and Thailand in 2024, I decided to invest in workwear and got a few pieces custom-made at a tailor's shop. I created vision boards, selected high-quality fabrics, and had some classic pieces made. I finally felt like I had outfits that made me feel confident in front of manager and director-level people.\n\nOnce I started wearing these suits back home, people asked me where I bought them from and were surprised to hear that I designed them myself. One woman said that if I ever turned it into a business, she would definitely be up for buying from me.\n\nWhen I heard this for a second time, I started thinking about building my own brand.\n\nStarting a business, especially one that I would fund entirely with my own savings, is always a daunting prospect. The biggest thought holding me back was \"Am I going to fail?\"\n\nIn late November 2025, about a year after my first trip, I went to Bali again, this time to learn how to surf. I stayed at a surf camp and was surrounded by inspiring people from all over the world.\n\nIt was a reflective retreat for most of them, and many were there to figure out what they wanted out of life. I met people who took all kinds of risks: musicians who stuck to their passion even when they struggled to find a job, people in between career changes, or someone living out of a van while she figured out her life plan.\n\nTalking to them made me realize that I actually knew what I wanted, and it made me think about what was really holding me back. They told me that if I fail, it would be a good story.\n\nI launched my company's Instagram that day.\n\nIt's been a few weeks since I was at the surf camp and launched my business. I'm still working full time and plan to for a while, which means balancing the business before and after work.\n\nI spend one and a half hours in the morning on the business on most days, and time on the weekends and on vacation. I'm not in a rush since I have a steady job. My priority is going slow, making it work, and getting these outfits to women who would admire my slow fashion, anti-spontaneous shopping mission. I don't want to be just another fashion brand.\n\nThe first stage of production will require between 5,000 to 10,000 euros in investment from my savings.\n\nMy other big expense is time, since I have to do everything, including branding, marketing, and designing, by myself — for now.",

    "fullText": "Investing.com - Jefferies initiated coverage on Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual (BVMF:BPAC11) with a Hold rating and a price target of R$55.00.\n\nThe research firm cited BTG Pactual’s strong competitive position in Brazil, highlighting its ability to deliver return on equity exceeding 20% across market cycles and its diversified revenue mix.\n\nJefferies noted the bank’s long-standing partnership model with a meritocratic approach and alignment with minority shareholders, as well as its strong past performance in gaining market share across all businesses, with core revenue growing at approximately 25% compound annual growth rate since 2020.\n\nDespite these strengths, Jefferies views BTG Pactual as fairly priced at current levels, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of approximately 11x and a price-to-book ratio of 2.5x according to their base case analysis.\n\nThe firm acknowledged growth potential in retail banking for SME lending and affluent clients, as well as expansion across Latin America, but cautioned that upside would require flawless execution, with their R$55 price target implying less than 5% upside potential.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.",

    "fullText": "Ribs (рёбра, translit. ryobra), also known as music on ribs (Музыка на рёбрах), jazz on bones (Джаз на костях), bones, bone music or roentgenizdat (рентгениздат, lit. X-ray publishing), are improvised gramophone recordings made from X-ray films. Mostly made through the 1950s and 1960s,[1][2] ribs were a black market method of smuggling in and distributing music that was banned from broadcast in the Soviet Union. Banned artists included emigre musicians, such as Pyotr Leshchenko and Alexander Vertinsky, and Western artists, such as Elvis, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys, Ella Fitzgerald and Chubby Checker.[3][4]\n\nMedical X-rays, purchased or picked out of the trash from hospitals and clinics, were used to create the recordings. The X-rays were cut into 7-inch discs[5] and the center hole was burned into the disc with a cigarette.[6] According to Russian music critic and rock journalist Artemy Troitsky, \"grooves were cut [at 78rpm][5] with the help of special machines (made, they say, from old phonographs by skilled conspiratorial hands)\"; he added that the \"quality was awful, but the price was low, a ruble or a ruble and a half.\"[7] The disks could be played five to ten times.[8]\n\nThe clandestine approach to circulating banned popular foreign music eventually led to a law being passed in 1958 that forbade the home-production of recordings of \"a criminally hooligan trend\".[5] The \"hooligan trend\" refers to the stilyagi (from the word stil meaning style in Russian), a Soviet youth subculture known for embracing Western styles of dress and dance.[9]\n\nWhile on tour with The Real Tuesday Weld in Saint Petersburg, the English musician Stephen Coates came across an X-ray record at a market stall. Coates was inspired to launch The X-Ray Audio Project, an initiative to provide a resource of information about roentgenizdat recordings with visual images, audio recordings and interviews.[10] In November 2015, after several years of research and interviewing bone bootleggers, his book X-Ray Audio: The Strange Story of Soviet Music on the Bone was published by Strange Attractor.[11]\n\nIn June 2015, Coates gave a TED talk on the subject at TEDX Kraków.[12] He and sound artist and researcher Aleksander Kolkowski went on tour, telling the story of the Soviet X-ray bootleggers and cutting new X-ray records from live musical performances as a demonstration of the process. The touring exhibition Coates created with photographer Paul Heartfield was covered in The Guardian and on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.[10][13] In September 2016, the pair released the long-form documentary Roentgenizdat featuring interviews with original Soviet-era bootleggers and archive footage.\n\nIn 2019, Coates wrote and presented Bone Music, a documentary based around interviews carried out in Russia for an edition of BBC Radio 3's Between The Ears series. The programme told the story of underground culture of forbidden music in Cold War era Soviet Union and featured the Russian band Mumiy Troll recording a Vadim Kozin song cut straight to X-ray.[14]\n\nOther preservation projects conserving collections ribs music include:\n\nThe short story \"Bone Music\" from the 2020 collection Good Citizens Need Not Fear by Maria Reva is about a lady who makes her living from the music \"on bones\".[16]\n\nThe 2025 exhibition \"Tomorrow I'll Miss You\" by neo-conceptual artist Richard Humann marries \"bone music\" with AI-generated music. Humann directed an AI to generate 60s-inspired songs which he printed onto individual X-ray discs.[17] [18]",

He was celebrated for his glamorous, elegant designs and his signature shade, \"Valentino Red.\"\n\nHis clothes were worn by numerous celebrities and even royalty, including Princess Diana, Jackie Kennedy Onassis, and Elizabeth Taylor.\n\n\"I know what women want,\" he said in \"Valentino: The Last Emperor,\" a 2008 documentary about his life and career. \"They want to be beautiful.\"\n\nHere's how women across fashion and Hollywood paid tribute to the designer after his death.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow paid tribute to Valentino in an Instagram post featuring a photo of her kissing the late designer on the cheek.\n\n\"I was so lucky to know and love Valentino-to know the real man, in private. The man who was in love with beauty, his family, his muses, his friends. His dogs, his gardens, and a good Hollywood story. I loved him so much. I loved how he always pestered me to 'at least wear a little mascara' when I came to dinner. I loved his naughty laugh,\" Paltrow wrote in the caption.\n\n\"This feels like the end of an era.

He is what true legends are made of, living on forever through the brand he created, the embodiment of timeless elegance and glamour. I loved the special times where I got to bring his creations to life on and off the runway. One of my favourite campaigns was in Rome where I became Anita Ekberg in La Dolce Vita, a memory I will cherish forever,\" Schiffer wrote in her caption.\n\n\"I will remember the fun holidays I spent with him in Mallorca, Ibiza and St Tropez. My Valentino wedding gown which I have framed at home as a constant reminder of his gentle, generous, sweet and loyal nature. Having him create my wedding gown was one of the great honors of my life, a moment I will cherish forever. I feel so proud to have been a part of his life. Repose en paix, Monsieur Valentino,\" she wrote.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker shared an Instagram post featuring a black background with red text that read \"RIP VAVA.

    "description": "\"What Wall Street tends to do with it, I don't really care,\" Khosla said.",
    "fullText": "Vinod Khosla has his eye on one AI metric, and it's not stock prices.\n\nOn an episode of OpenAI's podcast released on Monday, the famed venture capitalist shared how he's gauging whether we're in an AI bubble — or not.\n\n\"People equate bubble to stock prices, which has nothing to do with anything other than fear and greed among investors,\" he said. \"So I always look at, bubbles should be measured by the number of API calls.\"\n\nAPI, or Application Programming Interface calls, refer to the process in which one software application sends a message to another application to request data or to trigger an action. They are a common indicator of digital tools' use, especially with the rise of AI agents. High API calls can also be a mark of a poor or inefficient product.\n\nKhosla said the bubble shouldn't be called \"by what happened to stock prices because somebody got overexcited or underexcited and in one day they can go from loving Nvidia to hating Nvidia because it's overvalued.\"\n\nThe 70-year-old VC, whose notable investments include OpenAI, DoorDash, and Block, compared the AI bubble to the dot-com bubble. He said he looked out for internet traffic as a metric during the 1990s, and with AI bubble concerns, that benchmark is now API calls.\n\n\"If that's your fundamental metric of what's the real use of your AI, usefulness of AI, demand for AI, you're not going to see a bubble in API calls,\" he said. \"What Wall Street tends to do with it, I don't really care. I think it's mostly irrelevant.\"\n\nConcerns that the AI industry is overvalued because of massive investments became one of the buzziest themes in the second half of 2025. The phrase \"AI bubble\" appeared in 42 earnings calls and investor conference transcripts between October and December — a 740% increase from the previous quarter, according to an AlphaSense analysis.\n\nTop business leaders remain split about whether the bubble is about to burst.\n\nMicrosoft cofounder Bill Gates said AI has extremely high value, but it's still in a bubble.\n\n\"But you have a frenzy,\" Gates told CNBC in late October. \"And some of these companies will be glad they spent all this money. Some of them, you know, they'll commit to data centers whose electricity is too expensive.\"\n\nEarlier this month, \"Big Short\" investor Michael Burry raised the alarm on an AI bubble in a Substack exchange.\n\nBurry wrote that companies, including Microsoft and Alphabet, are wasting trillions on microchips and data centers that will quickly become obsolete. He added that their spending has \"no clear path to utilization by the real economy.\"\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has dismissed concerns of a bubble. His company became the world's first $5 trillion market cap company in October on the back of the AI boom.\n\nIn an October Bloomberg TV appearance, Huang said that instead of overspeculation, AI is part of a transition from an old way of computing.\n\n\"We also know that AI has become good enough because of reasoning capability, and research capability, its ability to think — it's now generating tokens and intelligence that is worth paying for,\" Huang said.",

    "description": "OpenAI's chief financial officer floated \"licensing models\" as a revenue idea as the company faces massive compute costs.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI's chief financial officer is musing about new ways the company could make money beyond ChatGPT subscriptions.\n\nIn an episode of \"The OpenAI Podcast\" published Monday, Sarah Friar floated the idea of \"licensing models,\" in which the company could take a share of downstream sales if a customer's product takes off.\n\n\"Let's say in drug discovery, if we licensed our technology, you have a breakthrough. The drug takes off, and we get a licensed portion of all its sales,\" Friar said.\n\n\"It's great alignment for us with our customer,\" she added.\n\nFriar's comments offer a glimpse of how OpenAI is thinking about funding its compute-hungry ambitions as it broadens its business model.\n\nFriar said OpenAI began with a single subscription after launching ChatGPT, but has since expanded to multiple price points, SaaS-style enterprise pricing, and credit-based pricing for customers who \"want to pay more to get more.\"\n\nAs OpenAI looks at commerce and ads, Friar said the model should always give the best answer, not a sponsored one, and maintain an ad-free tier.\n\nLast week, OpenAI announced it is preparing to test ads in ChatGPT, as the company seeks to boost revenue while facing spending commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the coming years.\n\nThe move marks a shift from the company's earlier stance. Less than two years ago, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described advertising as a \"last resort.\"\n\n\"Ads plus AI is sort of uniquely unsettling to me,\" Altman said during an event at Harvard University in May 2024. \"I kind of think of ads as a last resort for us for a business model.\"\n\nSince then, Altman's tone has evolved alongside OpenAI's expansion and ballooning compute costs. In June, he said on OpenAI's podcast that he wasn't \"totally against\" advertising, but emphasized that it would need to be handled carefully.\n\nOpenAI also completed its restructuring in October, shifting the company toward a more traditional for-profit structure — a change Altman said would make it easier to raise capital going forward.",

    "description": "Opinion: Freedom can be very contagious if it grows on its own terms. Europe of all places should know that",
    "fullText": "Opinion Europe is famous for having the most tightly regulated non-existent tech sector in the world. This is a mildly unfair characterization, as there are plenty of tech enterprises across the continent, quite a respectable smattering if it wasn't for the US doing everything at least ten times bigger.\n\nQuite the problem, sighed the EU’s 2024 Draghi Report on European competitiveness. Those regulations regressively hit startups and SMEs the hardest, there's no central capital market for funding innovation, while Uncle Sam's wallet opens wide for the ambitious and talented. It looked bad in 2024, when tech deficit was primarily an economic matter. Mix in the changes since then, and you can apply the five word version of all Russian history — \"And then it got worse.\"\n\nWhich is why the EU is now eagerly looking to open source as part of digital decolonization. It wants to end dependency on American software and services, not just for a healthier and more influential home sector, but to protect itself from hostile leverage.\n\nThe EU being the way it is, it wants to think big, and there's no doubt that FOSS has an infinite appetite for resources and relevance. FOSS is also mostly immune to EU regulations, which exist to protect citizens from systematic abuse. That possibility barely exists in open source development. You don't have to tell a bird not to rob banks.\n\nIt's just that you couldn't find a bigger culture clash between top-down and bottom-up if you invested a billion euros on a 27-nation research project. Finding the sweet spot where EU involvement can make the biggest difference to FOSS enterprise adoption, while maintaining the essential spark of agility and freedom that brings FOSS alive, that's where technical, economic and cultural engineering needs to happen. Fast.\n\nOpen source by itself is no guarantee of independence. Linux is the giant hogweed of European open source, even if it started four years before its home nation of Finland joined the EU. It has kept the internet and supercomputing free of commercial or state monopoly. The best it could do in mobile, though, is maintenance of an American OS duopoly. In the enterprise and public sector, it has done nothing to crimp Microsoft's tendrils. Which is where the EU most desperately needs it to succeed.\n\nAnd this is not for want of technical prowess, nor interoperability. In fact, there is far too much. Linux desktops have been enterprise-class for more than a decade, and of late the options for integration with Windows apps and functionality have flowered like fridge contents in a midsummer power cut. As Windows has got worse, the interoperable Linux choices have become better.\n\nThere are many options. Wine just gets better and better, no matter what distro you use. Windows-focused distros like Zorin OS come with lots of ways to look and function like Windows, including web app integration so online Word and Outlook integrate with the desktop. Products like Winboat offer highly optimized containerization to bring Windows apps to near-native Linux behavior. High performance specialized emulations like Winlator can run native x86 games — the good ones — on Android.\n\nWhat all these show is that small teams, even one-man bands, can use the very high quality software components freely available to almost completely remove old ideas of performance and functionality as batteries to platform-independent computing. The skills, the tools, the hardware and the whole production chain have been democratized. Given motivation and modest resources, FOSS designers can work miracles — and will. The downside is that there are too many good choices, making selection and support untenable in most organizations. Windows is Windows is Windows. Or it would be, if Microsoft stopped mucking about.\n\nWhat FOSS per se is bad at, is synchronizing with specific needs. It can do it with the right people, see Red Hat, but those people can also take it into darkness. Stare too long into the abyss, and the enterprise stares back at you. Focus, alignment, the disciplines of documentation, support and detail, get harder the more complex a system becomes.\n\nThis is where the EU could start to make an immediate difference to open source. It can say that it wants an open source desktop system that has explicit Windows migration support through a mix of technologies that will remain stable and supportable, and that reflects the particular needs of the EU's public and private sectors. This will be a state requirement that absolutely does not need state resources to meet.\n\nThen comes the support structure. Whatever team builds the distro will be the top tier of support, with everything else handled elsewhere. The EU's job will be to co-ordinate support for states, doing so in as transparent a way as possible so that the private sector can create and integrate support for itself. It's no different in the broadest terms to how support should work with departmental, company, and contracted support tiers, but with many more options, no secrets, and resources flowing into FOSS development as requirements evolve.\n\nThis whole process can be argued as necessary for EU state security and sovereignty, arguments we already hear loudly from Europe's erstwhile allies as reasons for far more than a new desktop OS. The initial migration will be as incremental and non-disruptive as possible, the aim being to demonstrate and sustain a new model of infrastructure evolution, one that can go on to power a roadmap of accelerating replacement and renewal.\n\nIt is very difficult to force the evolution of FOSS if the environment is wrong. It is very difficult to stop it, or even slow it down, when the environment is right. The EU knows what it wants and why it wants it. It also knows it can't force it. What it can do is create the right conditions and step back. Open source asks for no more than that. ®",

    "description": "India's central bank has proposed that BRICS countries link their official digital currencies to make cross-border trade and",
    "fullText": "MUMBAI/NEW DELHI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - India's central bank has proposed that BRICS countries link their official digital currencies to make cross-border trade and tourism payments easier, two sources said, which could reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar as geopolitical tensions rise.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recommended ​to the government that a proposal connecting the central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) be included on the agenda for the 2026 BRICS summit, the sources said. They requested ‌anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly.\n\nIndia will host the summit, which will be held later this year. If the recommendation is accepted, a proposal to link the digital currencies of BRICS members would be put ‌forward for the first time. The BRICS organisation includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, among others.\n\nThe initiative could irritate the U.S., which has warned against any moves to bypass the dollar.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has previously said the BRICS alliance is \"anti-American\" and he threatened to impose tariffs on its members.\n\nThe RBI, India's central government and the central banks of China, Brazil, and Russia did not respond to emails seeking comment. The South African central bank declined to comment.\n\nThe RBI's proposal to link BRICS' CBDCs for cross-border trade finance and tourism has not been previously reported.\n\nThe ⁠RBI's proposal builds on a 2025 declaration at a BRICS summit ‌in Rio de Janeiro, which pushed for interoperability between members' payment systems to make cross-border transactions more efficient.\n\nThe RBI has publicly expressed interest in linking India's digital rupee with other nations' CBDCs to expedite cross-border transactions and bolster its currency's global usage. It has, however, said its efforts ‍to promote the rupee's global use are not aimed at promoting de-dollarisation.\n\nWhile none of the BRICS members have fully launched their digital currencies, all five main members have been running pilot projects.\n\nIndia's digital currency - called the e-rupee - has attracted a total of 7 million retail users since its launch in December 2022, while China has pledged to boost the international use of the digital yuan.\n\nThe RBI has encouraged the adoption ​of the e-rupee by enabling offline payments, providing programmability for government subsidy transfers and by allowing fintech firms to offer digital currency wallets.\n\nFor the BRICS digital currency linkages to ‌be successful, elements like interoperable technology, governance rules and ways to settle imbalanced trade volumes would be among the discussion topics, one of the sources said.",

    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance rates, which have plummeted since six months ago. It could be a good time to buy a house. Lock in your rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates are decreasing. The average 30-year fixed rate has dropped by 83 basis points over the last six months, according to Zillow, and is now 5.90%. The 15-year fixed rate has fallen by 59 basis points during this time, currently sitting at 5.36%. Now could be a great time to buy a house or refinance your existing mortgage.\n\nMORE: Sub-6% rates: See which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nMORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 5.90%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 5.90% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,779, and you’d pay $340,587 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.36% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.36% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,429. But you’d only pay $137,224 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 5.90%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.36%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.11%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 5.90%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. Zillow's rates are usually lower than those reported by Freddie Mac and elsewhere. Each source compiles rates using different methods. Zillow gets rates from its lender marketplace, and Freddie Mac pulls information from loan applications submitted to its underwriting system. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S. And of course, your credit score.\n\nNot much. According to its December forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.4% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate above 6% through next year, yet dipping down to 5.9% in Q4 2026.\n\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac already buy mortgage bonds, and Trump wants them to purchase $200 billion in bonds. Would this strategy cause mortgage rates to decrease?\n\nAverage mortgage rates are in the low 6% range, but there are ways to snag a lower rate. Learn about eight strategies for securing a mortgage rate under 6%.\n\nChase Home Lending has launched a mortgage refinance rate sale, and borrowers have until Sunday to lock in a discounted rate.

    "description": "Scott Bessent argued Trump is “looking beyond next year to what could happen for a battle in the Arctic.”",
    "fullText": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed that President Donald Trump wants to annex Greenland in order to keep the U.S. from getting “dragged” into an “attack” on the territory from Russia.\n\nDuring an interview Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” moderator Kristen Welker questioned Bessent over why Trump is still seeking to seize Greenland despite the fact that the “leaders of Denmark and Greenland [have said] bluntly, ‘Greenland is not for sale.’”\n\nPolitics: 'It Will Be Done!!!': Trump Issues Ominous New Greenland Warning In Late-Night Rant\n\nWelker asked the question after noting that Trump alluded on Friday he may punish countries with tariffs if they don’t back his actions regarding Greenland.\n\n“Kristen, if we look for years, for over a century, American presidents have wanted to acquire Greenland,” he responded. “And what we can see is that Greenland is essential to the U.S. national security. We’re building the golden dome, the missile system.”\n\nClaiming that Trump is “being strategic” and is “looking beyond next year to what could happen for a battle in the Arctic,” Bessent said: “We are not going to outsource our national security. We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to other countries.”\n\nHe added, “In Trump 1.0, President Trump told the Europeans, ‘Do not build Nord Stream 2. Do not rely on Russian oil.’ And guess what, Kristen? Guess what is funding Russia’s efforts against Ukraine? European purchases of Russian oil. So America has to be in control there.”\n\nPolitics: CNN Panelist Goes Nuclear On Scott Jennings In Viral Post: ‘I’m Probably About To Be Banned’\n\nTrump has repeatedly floated the idea of annexing Greenland and hasnot ruled out using military force to obtain it despite pushback from European leaders.\n\nWelker pressed Bessent over how serious Trump is about Greenland and whether his actions have been a part of a “negotiating tactic.”\n\n“President Trump strongly believes that we cannot outsource our security,” he replied, before adding that “down the road, this fight for the Arctic is real.”\n\n“We would keep our NATO guarantees. And if there were an attack on Greenland from Russia, from some other area, we would get dragged in,” he said. “So better now, peace through strength, make it part of the United States, and there will not be a conflict because the United States right now, we are the hottest country in the world.”\n\n“We are the strongest country in the world. Europeans project weakness. U.S. projects strength.”\n\nWelker didn’t let up, urging Bessent to confirm whether Trump has been using a “negotiating tactic.”\n\n“Is the goal to get a deal to have enhanced security in Greenland, for example?” she asked.\n\nPolitics: Donald Trump Tries To Sweet-Talk Territory Takeover Bid\n\n“The president believes that enhanced security is not possible without Greenland being part of the U.S.,” he replied.\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Welker questioned the White House official over why it’s “necessary [for the U.S.] to take over and annex all of Greenland” despite the fact that “85% of people living in Greenland oppose” the potential move.\n\n“The United States has a base in Greenland. I’ve been talking to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Denmark has given the United States a green light to beef up its security as much as is needed in Greenland. Why not take that route?” she asked Bessent.\n\n“Well, again let’s look back. Denmark has a terrible history with Greenlanders,” he responded. “There were forced sterilizations up until the ’80s or the ’90s. So all of a sudden, now that the U.S. has expressed an interest, there is, you know, this new interest.”\n\nPolitics: Kristi Noem: Don't Say ICE Agent Jonathan Ross' Name\n\nClaiming that the “United States needs to be in control to prevent a war,” Bessent added, “And we do not want to get dragged into someone else’s war.”\n\nWelker later brought up that “senior Democrats say there are no pressing threats on Greenland’s security from Russia or China,” before asking Bessent what “evidence” the Trump administration has that there is a “pressing threat.”\n\nShe also noted “the Danish foreign minister says there hasn’t been a Chinese warship in Greenland for a decade.”\n\n“Well, first of all, Kristen, we have asymmetric information. And again, President Trump is being strategic here. What evidence was there that the Russians were going into Crimea? Well, actually there was a lot of evidence that the Russians were going to go into Ukraine,” he responded.\n\nPolitics: Wall Street Journal Flags A Dark Downside To Donald Trump’s Greenland Push\n\nBessent pivoted to placing the blame on the Biden administration. “And Joe Biden said, ‘Well, just take a little bit of it.’ But what we know is that Greenland can only be defended if it is part of the U.S.”\n\n“And it will not need to be defended if it is part of the U.S. The president is trying to avoid a conflict,” he added.\n\nWrapping up their discussion on Greenland, Welker asked: “If the United States were to take Greenland by force, how would that be different than Russia’s annexation of Crimea?”\n\n“Look, I believe that Europeans will understand that this is best for Greenland, best for Europe, and best for the United States,” he responded.\n\nWatch Bessent’s “Meet the Press” interview below.\n\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Called Out For Falsifying Michael Jackson, Diana Ross Photos In Epstein Files\n\nAnother High-Ranking Republican Can't Help But Praise Mamdani\n\nBessent Says U.S. Food Aid Benefits 'Could' Flow By Wednesday",

    "fullText": "A flurry of shark attacks has rocked Sydney, Australia over the past few days.\n\nIn just over 24 hours, there have been three attacks – the most recent being an 11-year-old surfer at Dee Why Beach, who managed to come away unscathed; then a victim believed to be in 20s, who was surfing at North Steyne beach, who is in critical condition.\n\nFootage of the latter shows the moment the shark made contact with the surfer.\n\nThe attack at North Steyne happened just after 6:00pm on Monday. Two others were in the water when the unidentified surfer was attacked. One, going only by the first name Ash, told the Manly Observer that the shark was a “five-meter [16-foot] monster.”\n\nAssisting in the rescue, Ash recounted:\n\n“My mate put him on his board and was pushing him into shore and there was blood on the board and I was trying to pull them to help out. The guy was silenced from the pain, but still conscious, and I kept telling him to not look at his leg and we just kept paddling.”\n\nOnce onshore, the victim went into cardiac arrest. First responders revived the man using CPR and a defibrillator. And he was transported to the hospital.\n\nEarlier that morning on Monday, an 11-year-old surfer was attacked by what was believed to be a bull shark, possibly four-to-five-foot long. Speaking to the Manly Observer, the young surfer whose identity has been withheld said:\n\n“I was on the board when the shark came up and bit it. I got knocked off the board. One of the guys out there went over to me and helped me get back in to shore quickly.\n\n“I’m physically fine but I’m obviously rattled and the board has a chunk taken out of it and a couple of bite marks in it.”\n\nDespite the chunks from his board, the boy walked away unscathed.\n\nPreviously, on Sunday, another shark incident rocked the region when a 12-year-old boy was attacked by a “large shark” while swimming in the Sydney Harbor at Nielsen Park in the suburb of Vaucluse. That makes three encounters in just over 24 hours.\n\nAs a result of all this activity, the New South Wales Police reported:\n\n“All beaches on the Northern Beaches are closed until further notice, and this will be reviewed on an ongoing basis.”",

    "fullText": "The new year has ushered in more than just a slew of resolutions. In one Maryland county, a ban on plastic carryout bags has now gone into full effect.\n\nAs NBC 4 Washington reported, shoppers in Montgomery County will now have to use more sustainable options to help carry out their items.\n\nOn January 1, 2026, the county's Bring Your Own Bag Law went into effect, meaning that your everyday plastic grocery bag is now off-limits.\n\nThe legislation is designed to reduce plastic waste and protect local waterways by prohibiting plastic carryout bags.\n\nPlastics can contaminate water sources with harmful chemicals, and as they break apart over time, they release microplastics that can enter the bodies of aquatic species through ingestion.\n\nThese tiny particles can eventually enter human bodies through seafood and from polluted water supplies. Microplastics have been linked to numerous human health issues, although further study is needed to understand their effects.\n\nPlastic bags can also harm animals on land. In India, for example, veterinarians removed 90 pounds of plastic, including bags, from a cow's stomach.\n\nShoppers who don't bring a reusable bag will be charged a 10-cent fee for paper bags at most retail establishments. Five cents of that cost will go back to the retailer to cover costs, and the other five cents go to the county's Water Quality Protection Charge Fund.\n\nDespite the county's efforts to help reduce the ongoing concern of plastic pollution, many area residents voiced their displeasure with the enactment of the law. For some, the added responsibility is just another burden.\n\n\"I mean, as I was packing this, I was thinking, 'So what if I have heavy items? It's going to bust through.' This is so ridiculous,\" one shopper said.\n\nShould plastic grocery bags be banned nationwide?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWhile another resident agreed that the ban's required paper bag fee was inconvenient, it was at least being put to good use.\n\n\"Actually, the bag fee, it's annoying, but it helps,\" the resident said. \"It really helps and it helps with the littering problem. It helps with people being too fast and loose with the plastic bags.\"\n\nMontgomery County isn't the only place to introduce such a ban. In Vermont, a statewide ban in 2020 led to a 91% decrease in plastic bag use, and around 70% of residents viewed the legislation as positive.\n\nAlthough it can seem like a hindrance at first, using reusable shopping bags can actually save you a lot of time and effort. By having a dedicated storage area in your car for reusable bags, you can always have them on hand when you go shopping.\n\nSince they are more durable than regular plastic bags, you can often fill them with more groceries to avoid the need for multiple bags.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Farmers in India are facing the devastating loss of a prized crop after a year of extreme weather and pests.\n\nThe Allahabadi guava crop in Prayagraj was decimated by a heavier-than-normal monsoon season along with a fruit fly infestation and fungal disease spread, resulting in the destruction of 13,000 quintals (2.9 million pounds) of the produce, per The Hindustan Times.\n\nGuava plays a vital role in the region's economy, with more than 1,300 hectares (3,212 acres) dedicated to the crop. Normally, an average hectare of guava orchard produces 100 quintals (22,046 pounds), but officials estimate that 10-15% of the yield from each hectare was damaged by the rain, pests, and fungi.\n\n\"Although the trees are bearing fruit, more than half of it is worm-infested and falls prematurely, leaving no buyers,\" Munna Patel, president of the Surkha Guava Growers' Association, told the outlet.\n\nThe excessive rain and moisture from monsoon season created ideal conditions for the fruit flies to thrive, according to one expert cited by the Times.\n\nFarmers have good and bad seasons, but the increase in frequency and severity of extreme weather events caused by human-made pollution is creating more bad seasons. According to the Farm Bureau, farmers suffered $20.3 billion in losses in 2024 from weather disasters.\n\nBad seasons result in devastating financial losses for farmers, especially smaller-scale ones, and also drive up prices for consumers. The Allahabadi guava is prized for its flavor and is typically only harvested in winter.\n\nExtreme weather that impacts farmers is a global issue, from Australia, where farmers faced losses from rain, to drought problems in the United States.\n\nThere are methods available to farmers to prevent damage from rain, hail, heat, and other issues, including raising crop beds, implementing drip irrigation, diversifying crops, and protecting soil health.\n\nIn the long term, it's important for governments, businesses, and everyday people to work together to limit the impacts of pollution and focus on solutions that support sustainability for the future.\n\nWhat is the biggest reason you don't grow food at home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Cathie Wood is making another bold call on the U.S. economy and stock market.\n\nIn a 2026 outlook letter published on Jan. 15, the ARK Invest founder and CEO says the U.S. economy is storing up energy for a sharp rebound.\n\n\"Despite sustained real gross domestic product growth during the past three years, the underlying U.S. economy has suffered a rolling recession and has evolved into a coiled spring that could bounce back powerfully during the next few years,\" she said.\n\nWood said post-Covid high interest rates squeezed the economy, hitting housing, manufacturing, and non-AI investment. But she is optimistic that easing rates and rising productivity could release growth potential.\n\nWood wrote in a post on X (the former Twitter) that the next three years could look like “Reaganomics on steroids,” which she believes could lead to “another golden age” for the U.S. stock market.\n\n\"Early in my career, I remember how deregulation, tax cuts, sound monetary policy, and peace through strength sent the dollar soaring, which put a lid on the gold price,\" she explained.\n\nIn the Reagan era, a mix of those forces helped the market enter a long bull that ran through much of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\"The Trump Administration’s policies are echoing the early days of Reaganomics in the 1980s, when the dollar nearly doubled,\" Wood said.\n\nWood focuses on emerging high-tech companies in areas including artificial intelligence, blockchain, biomedical technology, and robotics.\n\nShe gained a reputation after the Ark Innovation ETF delivered a 153% return in 2020. In 2025, the flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up 35.49%, far outpacing the S&P 500’s return of 17.88% in the same period.\n\nCRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP): 5.29%\n\nRobinhood Markets (HOOD): 4.06%\n\nBeam Therapeutics (BEAM): 3.79%\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR): 3.57%\n\nWood’s style brings sweet wins in rising markets but also painful losses in bearish ones, as seen in 2022, when the Ark Innovation ETF tumbled more than 60%.\n\nThose swings have weighed on Wood’s long-term results. As of Jan. 16, the Ark Innovation ETF has delivered a five-year annualized return of -10.31%, while the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 14.66% over the same period, according to data from Morningstar.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2024, the Ark Innovation ETF wiped out $7 billion in investor wealth, according to an analysis by Morningstar’s analyst Amy Arnott. That made it the third-biggest wealth destroyer among mutual funds and ETFs in Arnott’s ranking.",

    "fullText": "(KRON) — A Bay Area Democratic congressman has added their voice to a growing chorus of people calling for the 25th Amendment to be invoked over a letter President Donald Trump sent Norway’s Prime Minister. In the letter, Trump appears to connect his interest in the United States taking over Greenland to being bypassed for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n“Considering your country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,” Trump falsely claims in the letter to Norway’s PM Jonas Gahr Støre, adding, “although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.”\n\nCHP begins enforcing English language rule for truckers\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize is not awarded by the Norwegian government but rather by a five-person committee chosen by the Norwegian parliament.\n\n“Regarding the Nobel Peace Prize, I have several times clearly explained to Trump what is well known, namely that it is an independent Nobel Committee, and not the Norwegian government, that awards the prize,” Støre said in a statement to Bloomberg.\n\nTrump’s letter continued, “Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership’ anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also.”\n\n“I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland,” Trump continued.\n\nThe letter revived calls similar to those heard during the first Trump administration for using the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. The 25th Amendment pertains to what happens if the president or vice president becomes incapacitated — either mentally or physically — and is unable to fulfill their duties.\n\nUnder the amendment, members of the president’s cabinet could legally remove him from office if they do not believe he is fit to lead.\n\n“Trump’s new gigantic temper tantrum over Norway is deep into 25th Amendment territory,” wrote Rick Wilson of the Lincoln Project on X.\n\n“25th Amendment. Now,” tweeted former Republican congressman Joe Walsh.\n\n“Invoke the 25th Amendment,” tweeted U.S. Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA).\n\nEast Bay Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Livermore) simply tweeted “25,” along with a copy of the letter.\n\nNo member of Trump’s cabinet has signaled any intention of removing President Trump from office.",

    "fullText": "UConn women’s basketball snapped its three-game losing streak against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in style with an 85-47 win on Monday at Gampel Pavilion. The 38-point margin of victory is the largest in the history of the rivalry.\n\nAfter a tight first half in which the Huskies only led by nine, the hosts ran away with it in the second half, out-scoring Notre Dame 53-24.\n\nSarah Strong powered UConn with 18 points, 11 rebounds, three assists, three steals and three blocks. She also hit the 1,000-point mark with a 3-pointer in the second quarter, getting there in 59 games — third-fastest in program history behind only Paige Bueckers and Maya Moore (55 games each).\n\nAzzi Fudd finished with 15 points while Serah Williams had 10 points and eight rebounds. The Huskies’ sophomores each had big days as well. KK Arnold was the best point guard on the floor, totaling 12 points, five assists and two steals. Ashlynn Shade put up 10 points, four rebounds and four assists.\n\nHannah Hidalgo, who averaged 31.5 points in her two previous games against UConn, had 16 points but shot 5-15 from the field and 1-6 from three while turning the ball over three times. As a team, Notre Dame went 1-15 from three.\n\nWhile the Huskies only had a +3 turnover margin, they were +16 on points off turnovers. They also won the rebounding battle 39-22 — allowing just two offensive rebounds — and had more assists (22) than the Irish had baskets (19).\n\nUConn started fast, opening the game on an 8-0 run through the first 2:53. The Huskies’ offense faced little resistance as they made their first four shots while the defense held Notre Dame to an 0-4 start. But from there, the points didn’t quite come as easily for the hosts as they managed just eight points in the final seven minutes of the first quarter.\n\nDespite the offensive struggles, UConn’s defense picked up the slack. The Huskies didn’t allow a basket for the first six minutes and gave up just three in the opening period. Through 10 minutes, they led by nine.\n\nEarly in the second quarter, UConn began to pull away with a 7-0 run that extended its lead to 14 at the 7:31 mark, its largest of the day to that point. But much like the first period, the Huskies couldn’t keep the momentum going. Notre Dame scored 11 of the final 16 points of the first half to cut UConn’s lead back down to single-digits. The Huskies only went into the half up 23-32.\n\nUConn came out of the break with its hair on fire. The Huskies ripped off a 10-2 run sparked by back-to-back 3-pointers — as many as they had in the first half. Fudd capped it off with a steal-and-score that extended the lead to 21, which prompted Notre Dame to take a timeout and sent Gampel Pavilion into a frenzy.\n\nThis time, the Irish couldn’t stop the bleeding. UConn scored 17 of the next 21 points to pull ahead by 30. The Huskies put up 27 points in the third quarter — just five short of their entire first half total. They kept their foot on the gas in the final period and came out with the 38-point win.\n\nWith the win, UConn improves to 19-0 on the season. Next, the Huskies will return to Big East play with a trip to Georgetown on Thursday.",

    "fullText": "LeBron James criticized for Martin Luther King Jr.-themed Nikes originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNike’s latest LeBron James signature sneaker is drawing sharp criticism after images of a Martin Luther King Jr.–themed design began circulating online.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the shoe, an “Honor the King” edition of the LeBron XXIII, features an all-teal colorway inspired by the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, the site where Dr. King was assassinated in 1968. The motel later reopened as the National Civil Rights Museum. LeBron James debuted the sneakers earlier this month during the Los Angeles Lakers' game against the Memphis Grizzlies, a choice that further tied the design to the city’s history.\n\nMORE: Klay Thompson shows up to support Megan Thee Stallion's latest Dunkin promo\n\nNike has said the release was intended as a tribute, not a provocation. John Jowers, Nike’s vice president of communications, acknowledged the reaction but defended the design's intent. “Design is so subjective, and some people the design will resonate with, and others maybe less so,” Jowers said. “Obviously that becomes a little bit more charged when you have bigger principles at play. I think the intent, though, was really to pay homage to Dr. King, his life and his legacy.”\n\nthe fact that this is real indicates, yet again, that not enough black folks are in enough rooms at Nike. Or that they dont feel empowered enough to speak up. What a disgrace. pic.twitter.com/0a25AbAZLT\n\n— Clinton Yates (@clintonyates) January 19, 2026\n\nThat explanation has not quieted critics. ESPN commentator Clinton Yates was among the most outspoken voices pushing back on the concept. “The fact that this is real indicates, yet again, that not enough Black folks are in enough rooms at Nike,” Yates wrote. “Or that they don’t feel empowered enough to speak up. What a disgrace.”\n\nSome sneaker fans echoed that sentiment, questioning why a commercial product would reference the location of King’s death rather than his broader work or message. Photographer and sneaker enthusiast Randy Singleton summed up that discomfort succinctly: “Out of all the things to relate back to Dr. King Jr., the motel where his life was taken as inspiration for the shoe is outrageous.”\n\nMORE: Gabby Reece drops new namesake sneaker—and fans will love it\n\nThe National Civil Rights Museum also made clear it was not involved in the sneaker’s development. Museum president Russell Wigginton said the organization learned about the shoe only after it became public. “We certainly don’t mind people recognizing and appreciating the work that we do and what happened here,” Wigginton said. “But we have not been a part of any aspect of that, of the sneaker coming out.”",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets announced they have interviewed eight candidates to fill their defensive coordinator vacancy. Head coach Aaron Glenn will soon make a decision to appoint Steve Wilks' successor. Among the options, Detroit Lions assistant Jim O'Neil could emerge as the favorite.\n\nO'Neil has two advantages working in his favor. He's the only candidate on the list to possess previous experience with Coach Glenn. He's also just one of two candidates, alongside Wink Martindale, to have previously coordinated a defense in the NFL.\n\nLet's break them down into 2 categories:\n\nWorked previously with Aaron Glenn: Jim O'Neil (current Lions def asst/safeties coach)\n\nPrevious NFL DC experience: O'Neil (Cle, SF), Wink Martindale (Balt, NYG).

He also knows the Jets and AFC East well. O'Neil actually worked for the Jets from 2009-2012 under Rex Ryan, and later worked for the Buffalo Bills in 2013.\n\nO'Neil then coordinated the Cleveland Browns' defense in 2014-15, and then again for the San Francisco 49ers in 2016. The Browns fielded a top-10 scoring defense under O'Neil in 2014, but regressed to 29th in 2015. His 49ers defense in 2016 was the worst in the league, allowing 30 points per contest.\n\nThe Jets have a mixture of intriguing candidates. Ranging from veterans like O'Neil and Martindale to Jim Leonhard and DeMarcus Covington, Glenn has a decision to make. Glenn's familiarity with O'Neil could play a role.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jets Wire: Is Jim O'Neil emerging as Jets' defensive coordinator favorite?",

Gonzaga stands at No. 8 and received 1,103 total points from the voters.\n\nThis comes after two in-state road victories in Pullman over the Washington State Cougars and in Seattle against the Seattle U RedHawks. The Zags outrebounded the Redhawks, 44-24, despite not having their two All-American forwards in graduate Graham Ike, who landed awkwardly near the end of Thursday’s blowout 86-65 win at Beasley Coliseum (right ankle soreness), and redshirt junior Braden Huff (left knee injury in practice earlier last week).\n\nIt was the tenth different starting lineup (11 different players plugged in this season) used by coach Mark Few in 2025-26. The small-ball lineup with 6-7 senior wing Jalen Warley at the five spot proved effective. Freshman lead guard Mario Saint-Supery, manufacturing the offense with multiple pick-and-roll lob actions towards the rim, also helped in the 71-50 victory at the Climate Pledge Arena.\n\nThe Saint Mary’s Gaels (17-3, 5-1 WCC) received five total points after falling to Bay Area rival Santa Clara Broncos (16-5, 7-1 WCC) at the Leavey Center, 62-54, this past Saturday afternoon. Gonzaga is now in sole possession of first place in the West Coast Conference standings.\n\nBREAKING: College Basketball AP Poll🏀https://t.co/sy0Lgk3wr1 pic.twitter.com/yK74RouJ4g\n\nIn the NET rankings, Few’s group moves up to No. 4 amongst all college basketball programs. The Zags still remain 3-1 in Quad 1 opportunities, but now 5-0 in Quad 2. As for KenPom, Gonzaga drops to No. 6 (No. 8-ranked offense, No. 9-ranked defense).\n\nIn Bart Torvik, the Zags are placed at No. 10. With EvanMiya, Gonzaga moves back into the top-ten at No. 9. They’re still on the No. 2 seed line for the NCAA Tournament amongst most major publications.\n\nThe Zags look to continue their undefeated stretch in conference play back in Spokane against the Pepperdine Waves (8-10, 3-2 WCC) on Wednesday, Jan. 21. Tip-off is at 6:00 p.m. PT on ESPN+/KHQ. The students will be inside the Kennel for the first time since Dec. 7.

    "fullText": "Joe Burrow woke up from a social media slumber on Monday to weigh in on a pair of calls that sparked controversy in this weekend's divisional round playoff games.\n\nAs far as he's concerned, there is no controversy.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals quarterback tweeted a defense of game officials for their rulings on \"two plays\" that he declared \"were not difficult calls.\"\n\nHe mentions two plays \"yesterday,\" but is almost certainly referencing a late interception on a contested ball in the Broncos' divisional round playoff win over the Bills on Saturday and another play on a contested ball Sunday that was ruled a catch for Los Angeles receiver Davante Adams in the Rams' win over the Bears.\n\n\"The amount of ppl that don’t understand what a catch is in the rule book flabbergasts me,\" Burrow wrote. \"And it’s not the officials. The two plays yesterday were not difficult calls, and they got them both right.\"\n\nThe amount of ppl that don’t understand what a catch is in the rule book flabbergasts me. And it’s not the officials. The two plays yesterday were not difficult calls, and they got them both right.\n\n— Joey Burrow (@JoeyB) January 19, 2026\n\nOther than a retweet of a Netflix post promoting a show about him, that was Burrow's first tweet since April 26, 2024. He apparently feels strongly about this.\n\nThe first play in question was Ja'Quan McMillian's interception of Josh Allen in overtime of Denver's 33-30 win Saturday night. Bills receiver Brandin Cooks secured the ball in his hands on a deep pass that would have set the Bills up in position for a game-winning field goal.\n\nCooks was diving to the ground as he made the catch and still had the ball in his hands when his knee hit the turf. But McMillian had tight coverage and snatched the ball from Cooks' grasp after they hit the ground. He stood up with possession of the ball, and officials awarded him an interception. Denver drove for the game-winning field goal on its ensuing drive.\n\nWOW!! Interception Josh Allen on this crazy play pic.twitter.com/J7UyosDna5\n\n— Rate the Refs (@Rate_the_Refs) January 18, 2026\n\nOn the second play in question, Adams caught a ball in traffic in a tie game in the fourth quarter of Sunday's Rams-Bears divisional matchup.\n\nHe didn't take a step after securing the ball and was immediately taken down to the turf by a pair of Bears defenders. As his knee hit the turf, Bears defensive back Tyrique Stevenson had his hand on the ball, which was still in Adams' grasp. Stevenson then stripped the ball from Adams before Adams fully hit the ground.\n\nHow is this a catch from Davante Adams but the Brandin Cooks play wasn’t?\n\n*Both plays are catches fyi #BillsMafia | #GoBills \n pic.twitter.com/UWz2dkuTqU\n\n— Peter DiBiasi (@DibiasiPeter) January 19, 2026\n\nOn this play, Adams was awarded a catch. The Rams went on to score a touchdown on the drive for a 17-10 lead en route to a 20-17 overtime win.\n\nNBC rules analyst Terry McAulay agreed with the call on the field on the broadcast. He also was watching Saturday night and tweeted his agreement of the call on McMillian's interception. Per McAulay, Adams made a football act \"common to the game\" on his play that was enough to rule it a complete catch before his knee hit the ground.\n\n\"He clearly completed the catch on this one,\" McAulay said. \"He has it long enough to perform an act common to the game, and then he goes to the ground, and his knee goes down prior to him losing control.\"\n\nIn the case of McMillian's interception, Cooks was diving to the ground and, per McAulay, didn't establish a completed catch before his knee hit the ground, allowing McMillian to strip the ball for the turnover.\n\n\"A player going to the ground to catch a pass must maintain control during and after contact with the ground,\" McAulay wrote. That's the rule. Apply accordingly.\"\n\nBurrow didn't go into further details beyond his initial tweet, but it's safe to assume that he agrees with McAulay's interpretation of the rules. And those were the same conclusions that officials on the field reached in both games.",

And on the eve of the national championship game, the actor delivered an emotional message to Hurricanes coach Mario Cristobal.\n\n“I’m so proud of you,” Johnson told his former teammate. He added that the \"world would be watching\" as Miami prepares to face Indiana on Monday night at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nJohnson played defensive tackle for the Hurricanes on their 1991 national championship team, lining up alongside Cristobal, who was then a star offensive lineman. More than three decades later, Johnson is expected to be in attendance for Miami’s title clash and possibly even on the field to watch Cristobal go to work.\n\nA $1 million donation from Johnson helped fund renovations to the Hurricanes’ facilities. The home locker room at Hard Rock Stadium now bears his name: the Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson Locker Room. Indiana players will pass through it on their way to the field, a reminder of Miami’s history and star power.\n\nThe championship sets up a striking contrast. Miami enters with deep NIL resources and celebrity backing, while undefeated Indiana has embraced an underdog identity built on development and cohesion behind Heisman Trophy winner Fernando Mendoza and coach Curt Cignetti.\n\nMore: Ex-Indiana QB fires back after portrayal in CBS 60 Minutes interview\n\nThere is celebrity support on Indiana’s side, too. Business mogul Mark Cuban, who is an Indiana alum and major donor, has become one of the Hoosiers’ most visible advocates during their historic run.\n\nHowever, Monday night is personal for Johnson.

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams first two meetings this season have been such good games, it’s only right we get a third and final edition to make it a trilogy to decide the NFC.\n\nOver the course of the first two meetings, the two teams are separated by just one yard and one point apiece. In 126 minutes and 47 seconds of football, the Rams outgained the Seahawks 830-829 on offense, and outscored them 58-57. Collin Cowherd brought these remarkable anomalies up on his show today as well.\n\nAnyone who watched these two games knows how good they each were, with the second widely called the game of the year and the first featuring the same top-notch drama. Before each matchup, the hype train hoped they’d earn that moniker, and they each lived up to the impossible task. I wrote about how Sean McVay’s ability to revolutionize offense better than any coach in the modern generation was only countered by Mike Macdonald’s ability to mirror that on the defensive side of the ball. I suggested these matchups wouldn’t just feature the best two teams and coaches, but give us a preview of what football could look like in 2026 and beyond.\n\nNow the calendar has flipped to 2026, and the NFC Championship will be rightfully won by one of its two best teams. They’re so close with each other, but far ahead of the pack. Whichever NFC West giant represents the conference in the Super Bowl will be the heavy favorite. Seahawks fans would’ve rather played the Chicago Bears for an easier matchup, but football fans deserved a rubber match on this season series to complete one of the all-time trilogies of division rivals.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Seahawks-Rams is justice for NFC's Super Bowl representative",

    "description": "We share the most popular Super Bowl props and corresponding odds for Super Bowl 60, from the coin toss to game props.",
    "fullText": "The biggest game of the year comes with an even bigger feast of Super Bowl props to bet on! Get in on the action as we break down everything you need to know — from the best prop odds on the market to our handpicked favorite prop bets.\n\nKenneth Walker III is currently the betting favorite at +170 to score an anytime touchdown in Super Bowl LX, largely due to his role as the \"home-run hitter\" for the Seahawks. As the current Super Bowl favorites (+145), Seattle's offensive success heavily relies on Walker’s explosive ability. During the 2025 regular season, he surpassed 1,000 rushing yards and demonstrated elite efficiency, highlighted by a league-high number of explosive runs. His momentum is peaking at the right time, as evidenced by his dominant three-touchdown performance against the 49ers in the Divisional Round.\n\nWalker’s value is bolstered by his high usage in a high-powered offense led by Sam Darnold and Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Given that the Seahawks are projected to reach the championship game in Santa Clara, Walker's knack for finding the end zone in high-stakes matchups makes him the most logical choice for oddsmakers.\n\nLooking for a live longshot? Look no further than Denver RB RJ Harvey. The rookie sensation led Denver with 12 total touchdowns in the 2025 regular season (7 rushing, 5 receiving), carving out a role as Sean Payton’s preferred goal-line option.\n\nAt +1800, you’re getting elite value on a dual-threat back in a high-scoring offense. Harvey was No. 1 on this list a week ago, but Bo Nix's season-ending ankle injury has cast serious doubt into whether Denver can still advance to the Super Bowl.\n\nBetting on who will win Super Bowl MVP is one of the most popular and simple player props on Super Sunday. Skill positions and star players are normally among the favorites, including the starting quarterbacks for both teams.\n\nBe careful when taking long shots here, however, as a quarterback has won MVP in 34 of the 59 Super Bowls.\n\nFew would have guessed it when the season began, but the Seahawks and Patriots appear to be on a collision course. Seattle is a 2.5-point favorite at home against the Rams, while the Pats are 4.5-point road favorites against the Broncos, who will be starting Jarret Stidham under center. The former fourth round pick has not completed a pass since 2023.\n\nSince the NFL began using the current seeding format in 1975, the No. 1 seed from either the AFC or NFC has won the Super Bowl 27 times.\n\nBecause there are two No. 1 seeds every year (one per conference), this means a top-seeded team wins the championship roughly 54% of the time.\n\nWhile Super Bowl props can be a lot of fun to bet on, you should have a strategy and follow these tips to make sure you end up in the Big Game black:\n\nChances are if you’re betting Super Bowl props, you likely have a wager on the point spread or total. Use those wagers to build a narrative around how you see the game playing out and what each team has to do to get to that projected result.\n\nWith so many Super Bowl bets available, it’s easy to get your action tangled up. Make sure you’re not betting against yourself by contradicting previous wagers. If you like the Over, don’t bet on the Under when it comes to scoring or passing props. If you like the underdog to cover the spread, don’t bet on the favorite to go Over their yardage props.\n\nBetting on props was long considered a “square” market for many years. However, with the rapid expansion in prop offerings as well as the explosion in advanced analytics, more and more sharp bettors and professional gamblers are flocking to the opening prop odds.\n\nIf you’re trying to get the best of the numbers, pay attention to the early prop odds movement in the 12 to 24 hours after sportsbooks release these markets. Bookmakers will adjust quickly to these early sharp opinions. If you’re waiting until Super Bowl Sunday to get your prop bets down, you’re likely to get the worst of the number.\n\nSportsbooks up their available prop markets every February with more and more Big Game betting options. Plenty of these props are the same, in terms of format, but the totals and juice/vig attached to them can vary from book to book. If you have multiple sportsbooks available to you, don’t be afraid to shop around for the best return on your prop betting opinions.\n\nSuper Bowl prop bets, from basic game props and team props to the initial batch of player props, are released in the immediate hours after the Super Bowl matchup is set. Although now some sportsbooks are even providing hypothetical odds for matchups based on the potential outcomes of the AFC/NFC title games.\n\nFollow along as we’ll be updating this page — and our player props page — with live odds, picks, and analysis as soon as they are available.\n\nDepending on what they’re based on, Super Bowl prop bets can be graded and paid out either throughout the game or at the end of the game. The timing and promptness of payouts for Super Bowl bets depend on the sportsbook.\n\nMost Super Bowl betting sites have a large menu of Super Bowl prop bets. However, online-based books will offer \n\nWhile subjective, Super Bowl proposition bets (props) have nearly eclipsed commercials as the most fun and engaging part of the telecast. These entertaining alternatives to the standard odds markets can boost your winnings and maybe morale, too. Here are our keys to the props betting game:\n\nGreat way to diversify your bets, spreading action to different parts of the contest.\n\nTake your pick from the most commonly available: player, game, and exotic props.\n\nMake sure you’re not betting against yourself. If you like the Over, don’t bet on the Under when it comes to scoring or passing props.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

I expected it, but not the way it happened. I thought I would come here, be called in at the CBF. Have a conversation. I was actually caught by surprise because I was informed over the phone. Especially when it comes to the Brazilian national team, to the CBF,” he explained.\n\nRamón was dismissed in October 2025, after the elimination in the first round of the Under-20 World Cup.\n\nHe had been in charge of the youth team since March 2022.\n\nDuring this period, the coach also led the senior Brazilian National Team on an interim basis, in defeats to Senegal and Morocco.\n\nAccording to ge, Ramón was informed of his departure in a phone call made by Gustavo Feijó, CBF director, at the request of the organization’s president, Samir Xaud.\n\n“I had the opportunity to participate in important tournaments, to win important tournaments as well. I really wanted to be world champion, but unfortunately, that didn’t happen,” the coach recalled.\n\nWhile leading the youth national team, Ramón won the South American Under-20 Championship in 2023 and 2025 and also claimed the title at the 2023 Pan American Games.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

Indiana vs. Miami would be the 12th college football game he has attended since he was elected to his first term in 2016, and it would be the eighth he's attended as a sitting president.\n\nIn addition to attending the Army-Navy Game in December, Trump attended a Washington Commanders game against the Detroit Lions late in the NFL season and even made an appearance in the Fox broadcast booth. Last year, Trump became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl.\n\nMiami, where Monday's game will be played, is a particularly convenient location for Trump because he has a residence at Mar-a-Lago in nearby Fort Lauderdale. Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago on Friday and stayed there through the weekend, but he is set to return to the White House after the game.\n\nTrump is expected to attend the game with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who graduated from law school at Miami and represented Florida in the U.S. senate before being nominated to join Trump's cabinet.",

Now with Micah Parsons, I think Jeff Halfley is going to be the hottest coach in the NFL this offseason. He really gets the best.\nHe coached Darrelle Revis in college. He coached me.

    "fullText": "As ESPN readies to air the College Football Playoff National Championship game, the sports network is announcing plans for a documentary series on the coach who has won more national championships than anyone else – Nick Saban.\n\nThe six-part series titled Saban, from ESPN and Word + Pictures, is directed by Russell Dinallo and produced by Words + Pictures’ Connor Schell, Libby Geist, Aaron Cohen, and Alexa Conway along with Tom Rinaldi, with Gabe Honig serving as co-executive producer and showrunner. It will document the man who won seven college football national championships – one at LSU and six at the University of Alabama.\n\nCollege Football Playoff National Championship: How To Watch Indiana Vs.

There’s also a wealth of present-day interviews with Saban and his wife, the legendary Ms. Terry Saban, whose own influence and impact played a massive role in Nick’s success as a coach and leader.”\n\nSaban retired two years ago from Alabama and now serves as an ESPN analyst – as well as a pitchman for Aflac and Vrbo.\n\n“With my coaching days behind me, Ms. Terry and I have been doing a lot of reflection and realized we were ready to tell our story,” Nick Saban said. “The team at Words + Pictures has encouraged me to really look back not just at my time at Alabama, but every stop along the way – and not just reflect on what happened but consider the process which made it happen. I interacted with a lot of players and coaches along the way and I’m happy to see that so many of them have contributed to this docuseries. There’s a lot to tell, and I’m excited to share it all.”\n\nIn addition to his national titles, Saban’s football programs produced four Heisman Trophy winners and innumerable NFL stars. ESPN says the series will include “more than 30 hours of interviews with Saban, and more than 80 interviews with former players, assistant coaches, rivals, family, friends, and observers, the series offers a rare look at how he became the most successful and influential figure that the game of college football has ever known.”\n\n“There will never be another Nick Saban,” observed Connor Schell, CEO of Words + Pictures. “He’s a football genius, a singular leader, and a true icon who has done more than anyone to shape the modern game of college football and the culture around it. When you work with Coach Saban, you’re constantly reminded how every small detail matters and, in his case, that attention to detail and process has added up to an incredible journey and legacy. Working with Coach Saban and Ms. Terry has been a tremendous experience, and we can’t wait to share their story with the world.”\n\nESPN says the premiere date and full rollout plans for the series will be announced at a later date.\n\nThe Movies That Have Made More Than $1 Billion At The Global Box Office\n\nThe 25 Highest-Grossing Animated Films Of All Time At The Global Box Office\n\n2026 Awards Season Calendar: Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Grammys, Tonys & More",

    "description": "The Japanese chef Junya Yamasaki mastered a butchery technique that results in tastier seafood—and he’s taught some Southern California fishermen how to do it, too.",
    "fullText": "The method is considered significantly more humane than the standard alternatives for killing a fish (thwacking it on the head, letting it suffocate), and is analogous to halal and kosher butchery, which both require that animals be slaughtered with a swift, decisive cut to the throat. It also results in fish that tastes better and stays fresh significantly longer. “The process brings out the best characteristic of every species,” Yamasaki told me—a firm silkiness for white fish, a clean acidity for tuna. It works in part by stemming the flood of stress hormones and other chemicals that a fish’s body begins to release upon capture, staving off rigor mortis and the stink of decay. Conner Mitchell, a restaurateur and a commercial fisherman, and the captain of the Jamaica Day—the small pilothouse boat we were fishing on—was impressed the first time he saw Yamasaki do it. “I’m looking at a fish that would have been stiff, now as flexible as tissue paper,” Mitchell said.\n\nIn Japan, you can assume that the fish at any good restaurant met its end by way of ike and shinkei jime; in the U.S., the same is true at restaurants offering catch imported from Tokyo’s famed Toyosu Market. Among the fishermen of Southern California, the practice can largely be traced to Yamasaki, whose evangelism has quietly transformed the local seafood supply. On the deck of the Jamaica Day, Mitchell and an array of other energetic restaurant-industry dudes in their thirties—all of whom learned the technique under Yamasaki’s tutelage—set up rods, checked the boat’s radar, and gleefully spotted clusters of birds diving in the distance, which signalled that schools of bonito swam beneath them. Whenever a line began to jerk, the group exploded in a joyful chorus. Then the men took turns reeling the fish in, and putting them out of their misery.\n\nTwice, I reeled in a bonito myself—a process that I found surprisingly intimate, just me and an invisible squirming weight at the other end of the line. Both times, I struggled as I turned the crank, heart pounding, almost certain that I wouldn’t succeed, until I caught sight of a silver flash at the water’s surface. Then Danny Miller or Cole Moser—a chef and a bartender, respectively—would pull it on board. As Miller gutted one particularly beautiful specimen, tossing its organs into the spray before slipping it into a slurry of ice and salt water, he pointed out that, because of the ike and shinkei jime, the fish had retained its vibrant color. If it had died slowly, it would have already gone dull and gray.",

    "fullText": "Scaling long-running autonomous coding. Wilson Lin at Cursor has been doing some experiments to see how far you can push a large fleet of \"autonomous\" coding agents:\n\nThis post describes what we've learned from running hundreds of concurrent agents on a single project, coordinating their work, and watching them write over a million lines of code and trillions of tokens.\n\nThey ended up running planners and sub-planners to create tasks, then having workers execute on those tasks - similar to how Claude Code uses sub-agents. Each cycle ended with a judge agent deciding if the project was completed or not.\n\nIn my predictions for 2026 the other day I said that by 2029:\n\nI think somebody will have built a full web browser mostly using AI assistance, and it won’t even be surprising. Rolling a new web browser is one of the most complicated software projects I can imagine[...] the cheat code is the conformance suites. If there are existing tests that it’ll get so much easier.\n\nI may have been off by three years, because Cursor chose \"building a web browser from scratch\" as their test case for their agent swarm approach:\n\nTo test this system, we pointed it at an ambitious goal: building a web browser from scratch. The agents ran for close to a week, writing over 1 million lines of code across 1,000 files. You can explore the source code on GitHub.\n\nBut how well did they do? Their initial announcement a couple of days ago was met with unsurprising skepticism, especially when it became apparent that their GitHub Actions CI was failing and there were no build instructions in the repo.\n\nIt looks like they addressed that within the past 24 hours. The latest README includes build instructions which I followed on macOS like this:\n\nThis got me a working browser window! Here are screenshots I took of google.com and my own website:\n\nHonestly those are very impressive! You can tell they're not just wrapping an existing rendering engine because of those very obvious rendering glitches, but the pages are legible and look mostly correct.\n\nThe FastRender repo even uses Git submodules to include various WhatWG and CSS-WG specifications in the repo, which is a smart way to make sure the agents have access to the reference materials that they might need.\n\nThis is the second attempt I've seen at building a full web browser using AI-assisted coding in the past two weeks - the first was HiWave browser, a new browser engine in Rust first announced in this Reddit thread.\n\nWhen I made my 2029 prediction this is more-or-less the quality of result I had in mind. I don't think we'll see projects of this nature compete with Chrome or Firefox or WebKit any time soon but I have to admit I'm very surprised to see something this capable emerge so quickly.",

EnergyNet utilizes 1) an Energy Router that enforces galvanic separation and utilizes software-controlled energy flows over a DC backplane, 2) Energy Local and Wide Area Networks (ELAN/EWAN) based on DC microgrids that interconnect through an open Energy Protocol (EP), and 3) a control plane comprised of the Energy Router Operating System (EROS) and EP Server which is managed at operator scale through an Energy Network Management System (ENMS). We distinguish the architectural contribution (Tier-1 including components, interfaces, and operating model) from expected outcomes contingent on adoption (Tier-2). The latter includes local-first autonomy with global interoperability, near-real-time operation with local buffering, removal of EV-charging bottlenecks, freed grid capacity for data centers and industrial electrification, as well as a trend toward low, predictable, fixed-cost clean energy.

    "description": "The ride share giant is advocating for changes to California law that would limit how much lawyers can collect in fees. Attorneys say it will obliterate their personal injury practices and leave victims unable to sue.",
    "fullText": "This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here.\n\nThe long-simmering fight between some of L.A.’s best-known billboard attorneys and Uber, one of their most frequent targets, is poised to spill out of the courtroom and onto the November ballot.\n\nThe ride-share giant is gathering signatures for an initiative that, if passed by voters, would cap how much attorneys can earn in vehicle collision cases. The company pledges the change will give victims a larger cut of their settlement money, alleging predatory attorneys are inflating medical bills to increase their own profits.\n\nLawyers claim it will decimate their lucrative niche — car crash lawsuits in the automobile haven that is California — and ultimately leave thousands of people with small or challenging cases unable to sue because they can’t find an attorney.\n\nThis fight, lawyers say, is existential.\n\nAttorneys from Sweet James and Jacoby & Meyers — the names and faces of which will be imprinted in the minds of most California drivers — have given almost $1 million to a committee opposing the ballot measure, according to campaign filings. Dozens of other deep-pocketed attorneys have joined, raising an impressive war chest already surpassing $46 million.\n\n“Uber knows darn well what they’ve done,” said Nicholas Rowley, among those leading the opposition. “This law is designed to wipe out ordinary working people’s ability to get representation.”\n\nAttorneys have condemned the fee cap as a Trojan horse meant to trick voters into wrecking the delicate math behind personal injury lawsuits. Currently, personal injury attorneys typically take 33% to 40% of a client’s payout. That is enough, they say, for them to earn a living and risk taking cases on a contingency fee basis — meaning, if they lose, they don’t get paid.\n\nUber’s proposal would cap attorney fees for car crash cases at 25% and require extra costs — filing fees, depositions, experts — to be calculated before the fee split rather than coming out of the client’s portion.\n\nThe two sides have conflicting views of who would be expected to pay for medical fees, which often drain a significant portion of an injured client’s payout. Attorneys said in order to guarantee clients get 75% of the money, lawyers will have to foot the bill for these medical costs, opening the possibility they would walk away with nothing. Uber said the question of who covers medical costs is “not contemplated by the measure” and it expects clients would pay.\n\nThe measure would tightly limit what medical expenses can be claimed and curb most damages to rates based on insurance. A doctor-led political action committee opposing the measure has raised more than $4 million, according to campaign finance records, arguing it will prevent Californians from getting treatment.\n\nUber said in a statement that nothing in the measure prevents car accident victims from securing doctors and lawyers. Instead, the company said, the measure is aimed at tackling a perennial problem in California’s legal system: attorneys pushing car crash victims into expensive surgeries in order to fatten their fees. The only Californians affected, Uber claims, will be “shady billboard lawyers whose business model relies on abusing auto accident victims for their own personal gain.”\n\n“Californians deserve a system that prioritizes victims over billboard lawyers,” said Adam Blinick, Uber’s head of public policy. “Capping attorney fees, banning kickbacks, and ending inflated medical billing are common-sense reforms that will protect auto accident victims and lower costs, and we’re confident voters will agree.”\n\nUber has poured fuel on the fire with federal racketeering lawsuits targeting both Downtown LA Law Group, or DTLA, and Jacob Emrani, two prominent personal injury law offices in Southern California. The lawsuits allege the attorneys had “side agreements” with certain doctors to inflate medical bills for unnecessary procedures to get a larger payout.\n\nIn an Instagram post, DTLA called the lawsuit a “calculated attempt by a billion-dollar corporation” to suppress legitimate claims. An attorney representing Emrani called it meritless and part of a campaign “to shut the courthouse doors to victims injured by Uber drivers.”\n\nGearing up for a fight, Consumer Attorneys of California, a powerful trial lawyer trade group, is pushing three ballot measures of its own, including one seeking to increase legal liability for ride-share companies if a passenger is sexually assaulted by a driver and the other aiming to nullify the fee-capping measure if it passes. Billboards have sprung up across Los Angeles reminding Californians that Uber is the subject of a string of recent New York Times investigations into sexual assault by drivers.\n\nThe company said it has invested billions in keeping riders safe and has “done more than any other company to confront” sexual violence.\n\nConsumer Watchdog, a consumer advocacy group that sponsored some of the billboards and receives funding from trial attorneys, put out a “consumer alert” branding the fee cap as a “license to kill” measure, claiming it would ultimately pave the way for Uber to move forward with robotaxis without worrying about getting sued. Uber said this was “flat-out untrue” and the measure has nothing to do with autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe push by Uber comes at a tense point for California’s legal bar. The Times reported this fall on private investors looking to bankroll California sex abuse cases, and separate allegations of fraudulent lawsuits and unethical conduct by Downtown LA Law Group, a firm known for car crash lawsuits that played a prominent role in L.A. County’s $4-billion sex abuse settlement.\n\nDTLA has denied all wrongdoing and said it operates “with unwavering integrity, prioritizing client welfare.”\n\nSome attorneys worry about how voters will perceive their industry when it’s time to cast ballots.\n\n“I’ll tell you straight up, we could do a better job policing ourselves,” said Rowley, who said he believed the State Bar had historically been weak on California lawyers. “It creates a situation where Uber can do what it’s doing.”\n\nCalls for reform within California’s legal community have gained momentum in recent months.\n\nJoseph Nicchitta, the county’s interim chief executive officer, called on the State Bar to implement “badly needed ethical reforms” that would make big personal injury cases less profitable for lawyers. Attorney and business advocacy groups have made public pleas to keep private equity out of the state’s legal landscape, worrying it fuels frivolous lawsuits. Gov. Gavin Newsom has similarly expressed unease.\n\n“Our legal system is meant to provide justice, transparency, and accountability — not a business model that uses survivors of abuse or trauma as a revenue stream,” said a spokesperson for the governor. “California can — and must — hold two truths at the same time: standing unequivocally with survivors and victims, while also demanding integrity within the law firms and other businesses that work within our legal system.”\n\nCalifornians unhappy with problem law firms already have a way to ding them without the ballot measure, Uber’s opponents argue. A new law went into effect Jan. 1 giving private citizens the right to sue an attorney for unethical practices. Many such practices are already illegal but seldom prosecuted. That includes advertising containing false promises and using third parties to solicit clients.\n\nThe Times reported this fall that nine plaintiffs represented by Downtown LA Law Group were paid by recruiters to sue the county for sex abuse in juvenile halls, four of whom said they were told to make up claims. The firm has denied paying anyone to file lawsuits.\n\n“This is exactly why we wrote the bill,” said Sen. Tom Umberg (D-Santa Ana), a lawyer who oversees the Senate Judiciary Committee, in response to The Times’ Dec. 31 story on the firm. “I expect that someone will take it upon themselves to actually enforce that law.”",

    "description": "F5's Guardrails blocks prompts that attempt jailbreaks or injection attacks, for example, while its AI Red Team automates vulnerability discovery in AI systems.",
    "fullText": "Network and security teams managing enterprise applications face two emerging challenges: AI security and multi-cloud operations. F5 is addressing both with product announcements that extend its Application Delivery and Security Platform into AI runtime protection and multicloud managed services.\n\nThe company announced F5 AI Guardrails and F5 AI Red Team on January 14, following the January 13 launch of F5 NGINXaaS for Google Cloud. The AI security products came through F5’s acquisition of CalypsoAI in September 2025. NGINXaaS is a web-server-as-a-service offering that is now expanding beyond its initial Azure deployment in May 2025, with AWS support in development.\n\n“We’ve never been a walled garden—we believe in meeting customers where they are and integrating with their existing stack, whether that stack is F5 products or other vendors,” Shawn Wormke, senior vice president of product management at F5, told Network World.\n\nAI security requires a different approach than traditional network defenses. Web application firewalls (WAF) inspect HTTP requests for SQL injection. Intrusion detection systems analyze packet headers for known attack signatures. These tools operate at the packet and protocol level.\n\nAI systems present a different attack surface. A malicious prompt that tricks a model into revealing training data looks like legitimate traffic at the network layer. Wormke explained that AI security is another layer of security just like WAF. Where it differs is that traditional security threats live in packets, whereas AI threats live in the words, prompts and context exchanged between users, models and agents.\n\n“AI models can be manipulated into exposing sensitive data or generating harmful outputs impacting brand reputation and trust,” he said. “So you need a solution that’s purpose-built to secure and govern these new threats like prompt injection, new jailbreak techniques and model distillation.”\n\nF5 AI Guardrails deploys as a proxy between users and AI models. Wormke describes it as being inserted as a proxy layer at the “front door” of AI interaction, between AI applications, users and agents. It intercepts prompts before they reach the model and analyzes outputs before they return to users. The system applies policy rules to actual content rather than transport-layer characteristics.\n\nPolicy enforcement covers several categories. Guardrails blocks prompts that attempt jailbreaks or injection attacks, scans outputs for sensitive data patterns, and enforces compliance requirements including GDPR and the EU AI Act.\n\nAI Red Team automates adversarial testing against AI systems. It maintains a database of attack techniques that grows by 10,000 entries monthly as researchers discover new vulnerabilities.\n\nResults from Red Team testing feed directly into Guardrails policies. When Red Team discovers a vulnerability pattern, security teams create corresponding guardrails to block similar attacks in production.\n\n“It’s a very synergistic pairing wherein with AI Red Team you can send a team of agents to discover vulnerabilities in AI systems, and with AI Guardrails you can transform those insights into threat-informed defenses,” Wormke said.\n\nF5 acquired NGINX back in 2019 and has been expanding the capabilities of the web server platform ever since.\n\nNGINXaaS first became generally available on Microsoft Azure in 2023 and is now coming to Google Cloud. The Google Cloud expansion addresses customer demand for consistent tooling across cloud providers. “Customers have been asking for NGINXaaS across additional cloud platforms,” Wormke said. “Google Cloud was the next and now we are working with AWS.”\n\nThe service combines Layer 4 and Layer 7 load balancing with security and observability, available through Google Cloud Marketplace.\n\n“NGINXaaS is built on the pedigree of the enterprise version of NGINX, NGINX Plus,” Wormke said. “It has open-source roots and will support your open-source configurations, but it gives you all the capabilities of commercial NGINX Plus.”\n\nWormke noted that those capabilities include visibility into over 240 deep application metrics, intelligent load balancing algorithms, traffic optimization, in-memory state sharing, AuthN & AuthZ and it’s  ready to go F5 WAF for NGINX.\n\nThe NGINX project celebrated its 20th anniversary in October 2024 and is one of the most widely used web server and application delivery technologies. Beyond just the core web server, it is also used as a load balancer, reverse proxy, programmability layer, API Gateway, Ingress Controller and Kubernetes Gateway.\n\n“It continues to power a significant portion of the internet and API traffic today,” Wormke said. “It is far more than the web server that many think open-source NGINX is.”\n\nF5 continues development on both open-source NGINX and commercial versions. For instance, he noted that F5 recently announced Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) support for enhanced privacy as well as support for PQC (Post Quantum Cryptography). Looking forward, AI is going to play a big role in the future direction.\n\n“We are evolving toward AI-aware application delivery and security to enable secure, scalable and performant, agentic AI operations,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Norway has issued thousands of letters to citizens warning that the army may have to seize their homes and vehicles if war breaks out with Russia.\n\nNorwegian military officials said the letters were an advance warning to those with assets that may need to be requisitioned.\n\nThe requisition policy covers vehicles, boats, machinery and property, and around 13,500 “preparatory requisitions” were issued on Monday, valid for one year.\n\n“The requisitions are intended to ensure that, in a wartime situation, the armed forces have access to the resources necessary for the defence of the country,” the Norwegian military said.\n\nThe letters will not have come as a shock to most recipients, as two thirds of them were simply renewing requisition notices from previous years.\n\nAnders Jernberg, the head of the military’s logistics organisation, said: “The importance of being prepared for crisis and war has increased dramatically in recent years.”\n\n“Norway is in the most serious security policy situation since the Second World War. Our society must be prepared for security policy crises and, in the worst case, war... we are undertaking a major build-up of military and civil preparedness,” he added.\n\nNorway plays a key role in Nato surveillance of the Arctic region, where the melting of the ice caps has created a scramble to secure new shipping routes and lucrative raw materials.\n\nThe Scandinavian country shares a maritime border – as well as a 123 mile-long land border – with Russia in the far northern Arctic region.\n\nRussia and China are seeking to expand their presence in the Arctic region, with the former building up old Soviet bases in the region and expanding its nuclear weapons stockpile on the Kola peninsula.\n\nThe requisition notices were issued amid an ongoing diplomatic crisis between the United States and Europe over president Donald Trump’s plans to annex Greenland, the minerals-rich Arctic island.\n\nMr Trump has cited Arctic security concerns as his main argument for annexing Greenland, an autonomous Danish overseas territory that is part of the Nato alliance.\n\nHe has threatened military action to take over the island, a step that would probably destroy the Western alliance even as it faces the growing risk of war with Russia.\n\nOn Monday, it emerged that Mr Trump also wants to take over Greenland because he is upset with Norway for refusing to give him a Nobel peace prize last year.\n\nDenmark and Greenland say the island is not for sale. They have the full support of Britain and the European Union.\n\nBut Sir Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister, said on Monday that he does not believe the United States is planning a military takeover of the island.\n\n“I don’t, actually. I think that this can be resolved and should be resolved through calm discussion, but with the application of the principles and values that I’ve set out in terms of who decides the future of Greenland, and making clear that the use of tariffs in this way is completely wrong,” he said.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Telegraph, Norway’s defence minister warned that Russia had recently launched a major expansion of its military bases in the Arctic region.\n\n“Russia is building up on the Kola peninsula ... where one of the largest arsenals of nuclear warheads in the world is located. They [the nuclear weapons] are not only pointed towards Norway, but towards the UK and over the pole towards Canada and the US,” Tore O. Sandvik told the Telegraph.\n\nMoscow is also trying to gain full control over the Arctic region in order to block Nato access to key shipping routes, he said.\n\n“We are the eyes and ears of Nato in this area, and we see that they’re testing new weapons, for example, hypersonic missiles, and they are testing nuclear-driven torpedoes and nuclear warheads,” he said.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "The price of Bitcoin plunged to $0 on Paradex's perps exchange, leading to a liquidation cascade that required a chain rollback.",
    "fullText": "The price of Bitcoin dropped to $0 on perps decentralized exchange Paradex overnight, according to numerous users, after a database migration issue affected the Paradex blockchain, its block explorer, bridge, and API.\n\nAn issue was first flagged on the Paradex status page at 12:36 a.m, ET on Monday, shortly after social media posts flagged a cascade of liquidations as the price of Bitcoin plunged to $0 on the exchange.\n\nAround 2:00 a.m. ET, the exchange identified the issue and began instituting a fix that resulted in rolling back the state of Paradex Chain, a blockchain built using the Starknet stack. Starknet is an Ethereum layer-2 scaling network.\n\n“We have identified the issue and will be rolling back chain state to block 1604710,” the status update reads. “This is the time before the DB maintenance and is the last known correct state. All accounts will be restored to the state before the DB maintenance. We will provide more updates as we continue with rollback.”\n\nShortly thereafter, Paradex force-cancelled all remaining open orders, and around 5:00 a.m. ET it confirmed that all user funds were safe as its recovery process was ongoing.\n\n“Recovery efforts are ongoing. We can confirm that all user funds are SAFU,” a post on the status page at 5:16 a.m. ET reads.\n\nIt’s still unclear how much the liquidations tallied up to, but data from DeFiLlama indicates that the perps protocol has around $641 million in open interest. The protocol has facilitated around $37 billion in volume over the last 30 days.\n\nAll Paradex services are now operational, according to an update on the status page.\n\nBitcoin Slips On Trade War Fears, Sparks $865M in Liquidations\n\nThe exchange’s price glitch followed a volatile period of trading for BTC, which dropped from more than $95,000 to $92,284 just after 7:00 p.m. on Sunday. The 2% drop in the last 24 hours has eaten into the top crypto asset’s weekly gain, which now stands at 1.4% with BTC recently changing hands at $93,318.\n\nThe slide triggered a growing number of liquidations, which have now extended to more than $875 million over the last 24 hours—$234 million of which can be attributed to Bitcoin, according to data from CoinGlass.",

    "fullText": "Jan 19 (Reuters) - Ukraine's armed forces are introducing a new facet of air defence to transform their system, made up of small ​groups deploying interceptor drones, as the country braces for new mass ‌Russian attacks, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday.\n\nUkraine is still reeling from a wave of Russian ‌strikes earlier this month that knocked out power and heating to thousands of apartment blocks, particularly in the capital Kyiv.\n\nZelenskiy has repeatedly called for air defences to be strengthened, including increased assistance from Ukraine's Western allies.\n\n\"There will be a ⁠new approach to the use ‌of air defences by the Air Force, concerning mobile fire groups, interceptor drones and other 'short-range' air defence assets,\" Zelenskiy said ‍in his nightly video address.\n\n\"The system will be transformed.\"\n\nThe president announced the appointment of a new deputy Air Force Commander, Pavlo Yelizarov, to oversee and develop the innovation.\n\nUkraine ​has rapidly developed its drone manufacturing system since Russia launched its invasion ‌of its smaller neighbour in February 2022, and has emphasised interceptor drones as an effective and economical way to parry Russian strikes.\n\nIn his remarks, Zelenskiy warned Ukrainians to be \"extremely vigilant\" ahead of anticipated new Russian attacks.\n\n\"Russia has prepared for a strike, a massive strike, and is waiting for the moment to ⁠carry it out,\" he said, urging every ​region in the country to \"be prepared to respond ​as quickly as possible and help people\".\n\nBoth Zelenskiy and Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha warned at the weekend that Ukrainian intelligence had ‍noted Russia was ⁠conducting reconnaissance of specific targets, particularly substations that supply nuclear power plants.\n\nThe president also said he had instructed Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko to make ⁠decisions this week regarding difficulties from the recent attacks, including bonuses for tens of thousands of ‌emergency crew members restoring heating and electricity.",

    "title": "Watch Veronika the brown cow pick up a rake to scratch herself—a scientific first",
    "description": "Veronika the cow has learned to scratch herself with deck brushes and other tools. Scientists took note.",
    "fullText": "Veronika, a cow living in an idyllic mountain village in the Austrian countryside, has spent years perfecting the art of scratching herself with sticks, rakes, and deck brushes. Now that scientists have discovered her, she has the distinction of the first cow known to use tools.\n\nShe picks up objects with her tongue, grips them tight with her mouth, and directs their ends to where she wants them most. When she’s wielding a deck brush, she will use the bristled end to scratch her thick-skinned back, but switches to the smooth handle when scratching her soft, sensitive belly.\n\nIn a new study, published in the journal Current Biology, scientists from the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna analyzed Veronika’s behavior and concluded that it qualifies as a tool use. Despite roughly 10,000 years of humans living with cattle, this is the first time scientists have documented a cow using a tool.\n\nThe researchers say their discovery not only shows that cows are smarter than we think they are, but also that other cows could develop similar skills, given the chance.\n\nThe brown cow’s know-how came to the attention of scientists last year after Alice Auersperg, a cognitive biologist at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, published a book on tool use in animals. Shortly after, her inbox was flooded with messages from people claiming to have seen their pets use tools. “I got all of those emails from people saying things like ‘my cat is using the Amazon box as a tool. It’s her new house,’” she says. Among these mundane reports was something truly new: a video of a cow picking up a rake and scratching her backside with it.\n\n“It seemed really interesting,” she recalls. “We had to take a closer look.” Not long after, Auersperg and her colleague Antonio Osuna-Mascaró, a post-doctoral researcher at the same University, drove to Veronika’s home.\n\nTo say Veronika was living her best life would be an understatement. Her owner, a soft-hearted baker named Witgar Wiegele, had kept Veronika and her mother as pets. She'd spent her life roaming around a picturesque pasture surrounded by forests and snow-covered mountains. Veronika, now 13 years old, has had many years to mess around with the many sticks and landscaping tools that line her enclosure.\n\nThe only downside to her idyllic lifestyle is that each summer, horse flies plague Wiegele’s property. According to the researchers, the desire to shoo these flies away and scratch their bites likely drove Veronika to develop her self-scratching skills.\n\nAfter getting to know Veronika, the researchers conducted behavioral tests to determine if Veronika was truly a tool user. The definition of tool use “is very strict,” Auersperg says. To be considered a tool user, an animal must intentionally grasp an object and direct its functional end toward a target, creating a mechanical interaction that achieves a goal.\n\n(This might be the first recorded tool use by a wild wolf)\n\nTo test Veronika’s skills, the researchers would place a deck brush on the ground near her in a random position and record which end Veronika grabbed and which part of her body she scratched. What the researchers saw took them by surprise.\n\n“Her tongue rolled out like a carpet,” says Auersperg. “The tip of her tongue was like a really dexterous index finger; it grabbed the stick in the middle and rolled it into her mouth. She held [the brush] very stably, turned her neck, and started scratching herself. It was really, really amazing.”\n\nAfter dozens of tests, during which the researchers saw her use different ends of the brush, as well as different scratching styles, depending on which part of her body she was targeting, they concluded that her behavior was deliberate and controlled.\n\n“There's absolutely no question that this is tool use,” says Robert Shumaker, an evolutionary biologist and President of the Indianapolis Zoo. Shumaker, who recently co-authored a book on tool use in animals and was not involved with the new study, says he is excited to see cows added to the list of tool-using animals, but not surprised. Other domesticated hoofed mammals, such as water buffalo and goats, are known to use tools, so it makes sense, he says, that cows can too.\n\n(Dolphins learn how to use tools from peers, just like great apes)\n\nIn 1982, cartoonist Gary Larson published a comic titled Cow Tools that depicted a cow standing beside a random assortment of useless objects. The joke hinged on the widespread belief that cows are simple creatures incapable of making or using tools.\n\nThis belief, while convenient for those who prefer to think of cows as unintelligent, is entirely misguided, says Osuna-Mascaró. “We don't think that Veronica is the Einstein of cows; we think that her conditions are special enough for her to be able to express herself in a way that other cows simply can't,” he says. “She has all the objects in the world to interact with and the time to learn how to use them.”\n\nAccording to Wiegele, Veronika began scratching herself with sticks when she was only 3 years old. At first, she was clumsy, but over the past nine years, she has honed her skills and can now scratch with precision.  Given the time and enriched environment Veronika was afforded, other cows would likely exhibit the same behavior, Osuna-Mascaró says.\n\nOsuna-Mascaró also believes that there may be other species whose tool use has similarly flown under the radar. He invites anyone who has a report of animals using tools that haven't previously been documented to email him. But please, do refrain from sending him anecdotes about your cats’ adeptness with cardboard boxes.",

    "title": "Both Walking And Cycling Can Help You Lose Weight—But One Is More Effective for Strength and Weight Loss",
    "description": "Walking and cycling are both great workouts for different goals. Trainers explain which workout is better for endurance, strength, and weight loss.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nWalking has had quite a year, between the rise of the viral hot girl walking trend on social media and walking accessories like bala bangles and weighted vests becoming trendy. It’s a solid form of cardio, but that doesn’t mean you should sleep on other heart-healthy workouts, like the oldie-but-goodie activity of cycling.\n\nWalking and cycling are two of the most popular types of aerobic workouts—and there’s a reason. For starters, they’re both low-impact, meaning, they’re “easier on the joints than, say, running or HIIT training,” says Olivia Amato, CPT, a bike, tread, boot camp, and strength instructor for Peloton based in New York City.\n\nWhen it comes to walking vs. cycling, both activities are great for beginners and can be made more difficult—either by walking with wrist or ankle weights, or cranking up the resistance on your bike. Both forms of exercise have perks when it comes to improving endurance, building strength, and losing weight, but one *may* reign supreme.\n\nWondering which form of exercise to make a mainstay in your workout routine? Ahead, trainers reveal the benefits of both—and how to integrate walking and cycling into your schedule.\n\nWalking is low-impact, so it’s easy on the joints, and it’s accessible—all you need is a pair of walking shoes—and you can get your steps in either outdoors or inside on a treadmill, says Claudette Sariya, CPT, a NASM-certified personal trainer and alum of the Women’s Health/Men’s Health Strength in Diversity initiative based in New York City.\n\nWalking is also easy to intensify. If you’re used to walking on flat ground (or the treadmill), you can level up your walks by going uphill or increasing the incline, Sariya adds. You can also walk faster, or wear a weighted vest or ankle or wrist weights.\n\nWalking is also a weight-bearing exercise, as “you're holding up your entire body as you're moving,” says Amato. This can strengthen your lower body and improve your posture, back pain, and bone density, adds Melissa Darlow, RDN, CPT, a New York City-based registered dietitian and certified trainer. And walking can definitely improve your endurance and stamina, depending on the type of walking you’re doing and for how long. For instance, power walking is a great way to build your stamina, Amato says.\n\nCycling is even lower-impact than walking, Amato says, adding that it’s gentler on your knees and hips since pedaling provides support, so you don’t have to hold your body up as much. You can pedal as slow or fast as you want and easily increase the resistance, so it’s easy to control the intensity of the workout. The fact that you can add more resistance while cycling versus walking leads to bigger strength gains and more calories burned, Sariya says.\n\nGenerally, walking is “definitely one of the forms of working out that's going to build lower body strength,” Amato says. It’s a better core workout than cycling because you’re standing up and you have to maintain your balance while moving, Sariya adds. (Walking up an incline works your core even harder because you have to brace it to protect your lower back, Amato adds.) Plus, if you’re wearing a weighted vest, you’ll work all of your lower body muscles, especially your outer quads and calves.\n\nHowever, you won’t get a true strength workout from walking because you’re not bearing as much weight as you would if you’re lifting dumbbells, for example, Darlow says. You can really only build muscle while cycling if you’re walking up an incline, but even then, it’s not a lot, says Sariya. But “in combination with other weightbearing exercises, absolutely, [walking] can lead to an increased level of strength,” Darlow says.\n\nWhen it comes to cycling, because there’s an ability to add resistance, it builds more strength and muscle in your full body, especially your lower body muscles like the inner thighs, quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves, and ankles, Sariya says. You’re also using your core and arms to hold yourself up. The resistance also helps build strength faster than you would if you were just walking, Amato adds. So, you can spend less time cycling than walking, and become stronger.\n\nIf you want to burn body fat, you’ll want to get your heart rate into Zone 2 or 3—the threshold states where your body burns fat as fuel—either while walking or biking. You can do this by walking on an incline or increasing resistance on your bike—you just need to see that your heart rate hits that threshold.\n\nFYI, you’ll know if you’re doing Zone 2 cardio if your heart rate is at 60 to 70 percent of your max (multiply your age by 0.7, then subtract that number from 208). Or, if you don’t own a tracker, you might feel like your rate of perceived exertion (RPE), i.e., the effort it takes you to do the workout, is at a three to five out of 10. For Zone 3 cardio, your heart rate will be at 70 to 80 percent of your heart rate max, and your RPE will be at a six out of ten.\n\nIt’s easier to burn calories faster on a bike because you can up the resistance. In order to burn the same amount of calories walking, you need to add weights and increase your speed, Sariya says. So, if you only have 20 minutes and you don’t have a weighted vest or ankle weights, it’s more efficient to hop on a bike if weight loss is your goal, Amato says.\n\nThe most effective way to lose weight is by picking an activity you’ll stay consistent with, Darlow says. So, if you \n\nSince you can tap into different cardio zones in both workouts, they’re both good for heart health. But if you only have a few minutes for a workout, “cycling is going to be your best bet because it's easy and quick for you to change your resistance and be able to switch from your Zone 2 into your Zone 4 and then back down,” Sariya says. But with walking, you might not have an incline or hills nearby to walk on, or there might be people in your way on the sidewalk, which makes it harder to change your speed to reach a higher zone.\n\nHowever, “as long as someone is finding a regular movement routine and challenging themselves to an extent,” your heart will see benefits, regardless of whether you’re walking or cycling, Darlow adds.\n\nWhether your goals are improving endurance, building strength, or losing weight, cycling is a better workout, especially if you only have a few minutes to exercise, Sariya says. But adding both walking and cycling into your routine is also beneficial for working the full body, Amato adds.\n\nHere’s how to fit walking and/or cycling into your routine, based on your goals.\n\nIf your goal is building endurance: Cycle or walk three to four times a week for 35 minutes, making sure that for 80 percent of the workout, your heart rate is in Zone 2 cardio. The other time should be spent cycling between Zone 3 and 4 cardio, Sariya says. This interval training will help build your endurance.\n\nIf your goal is improving strength: Cycle two to three times a week for 35 to 45 minutes, cranking up your resistance so it feels like you’re going uphill. On a scale of one to 10, you should feel like you’re giving 70 or 80 percent in terms of how hard you’re pushing, but also give yourself a few breaks during the workout. Supplement your cycling sessions with two to three days of strength training.\n\nIf your goal is losing weight: Get at least 30 to 45 minutes of cardio in four to five days a week, whether you’re walking on an incline or cycling with your resistance up. Make sure your heart is in Zone 2 or 3 for the entire workout so you burn fat.\n\nAt the end of the day, both walking and cycling are great, and you’ll see gains from both. “What's right for you really depends on your personal goals and what makes you happy,” Amato says. “Finding any way to move that you enjoy is really the goal.” So, whether you’re walking or cycling, make sure to push yourself, and you’ll see the best gains.\n\nMeet The Experts: Olivia Amato, CPT, is a bike, tread, boot camp, and strength instructor for Peloton based in New York City.

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum quelled concerns on Monday about two recent movements of the U.S. military in the vicinity of Mexico that have the country on edge since the attack on Venezuela.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration urged U.S. aircraft operators to “exercise caution” when flying over the eastern Pacific Ocean near Mexico, Central America and parts of South America, citing “military activities.”\n\nThe president said her administration waited a couple hours until the U.S. government provided “written” assurance that there would not be any U.S. military flights over Mexican territory. She said the U.S. government had not given Mexico a heads up about any military operations.\n\nThe U.S. government provided precise coordinates for where it was operating and Mexican authorities issued a statement saying the FAA advisory had no implications for Mexico.\n\nThen, images of a U.S. military transport airplane on the tarmac at Toluca’s airport about 39 miles (63 kilometers) west of Mexico City began circulating on social media.\n\nSen. Clemente Castañeda, of the opposition Citizen Movement party, posted on social platform X asking for an explanation from the government, because Mexico’s senate is supposed to approve sending Mexican troops abroad or allowing foreign troops into Mexico.\n\nSheinbaum described it as a “logistical” operation that did not require senate approval.\n\n“The United States plane landed, public servants got on that plane and they went (to the U.S.) for training,” Sheinbaum said. “Who authorized this? The Secretary of Defense.”\n\nHer security cabinet had posted on X Sunday night that such training operations “occur in conformity with established protocols and in adherence to the bilateral collaboration agreements.”\n\nBoth events highlighted the sensitivity created by not only the Trump administration’s unilateral action to capture Venezuela's then-President Nicolás Maduro earlier this month, but the subsequent renewal of offers and threats to take direct military action against the drug cartels in Mexico.\n\nSheinbaum and Trump spoke again last week on the subject. Both governments continue to say they will collaborate on security issues, with Mexico emphasizing that it will not accept violations of its sovereignty.\n\nSecurity officials from both countries are scheduled to meet again Friday in an effort to “continue delivering tangible actions to strengthen security cooperation and meaningful outcomes to counter cartels, and stop the illicit flow of fentanyl and weapons from crossing our shared border,” according to a joint statement released last Thursday.",

    "fullText": "Mr. Tariff’s eponymous policy is causing Americans more harm than good.\n\nContrary to President Donald Trump’s favorite economic claim, U.S. import tariffs are almost exclusively paid for by Americans, new research has found.\n\nThe study, published on Monday by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think-tank, reports that American consumers and importers bear 96 percent of the burden from Trump’s aggressive tariff policy.\n\nTrump, 79, has spent the majority of his second term boasting that his tariffs are bringing in billions in revenue from other nations.\n\n“The tariffs are an own goal,” Kiel Institute Research Director and a co-author of the study, Julian Hinz, said. “The claim that foreign countries pay these tariffs is a myth. The data show the opposite: Americans are footing the bill.”\n\nThe research examined over 25 million shipment records for U.S. imports between January 2024 and November 2025, totaling nearly $4 trillion in value, and found that foreign exporters paid only about four percent of the tariff burden, while U.S. buyers absorbed the rest.\n\nInstead of taxing foreign producers, the tariffs serve more as a domestic consumption tax, the report says, predicting that American consumers will face higher prices going forward.\n\nThe data showed that rather than countries reducing their prices to offset the tariffs, they reduced their shipping to the U.S.\n\n“We compared Indian exports to the US with shipments to Europe and Canada and identified a clear pattern,” Hinz said. “Both export value and volume to the US dropped sharply, by up to 24 percent. But unit prices—the prices Indian exporters charged—remained unchanged. They shipped less, not cheaper.”\n\n“Tariffs ultimately disadvantage everyone,” he added.\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Kush Desai told the Daily Beast: “The average tariff imposed by America has increased by almost tenfold under President Trump, and inflation has continued to cool from Biden-era highs.”\n\n“The Administration has consistently maintained that foreign exporters who depend on access to the American economy, the world’s biggest and best consumer market, will ultimately pay the cost of tariffs, and that’s exactly what’s playing out,” Desai said.\n\nTrump’s obsession with tariffs has heightened global tensions throughout his second term, as his unpredictable threats and follow-through have led to volatile market conditions.\n\nIn a lengthy post to Truth Social on Saturday, the president threatened a 10 percent import tax against eight European nations that have opposed his takeover of Greenland, which would take effect on February 1.\n\n“These Countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable,” Trump wrote. “Therefore, it is imperative that, in order to protect Global Peace and Security, strong measures be taken so that this potentially perilous situation end quickly, and without question.”\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to rule on the legality of Trump’s global tariffs, to which Trump said the U.S. would be “SCREWED” if the court did not rule in his favor.",

    "fullText": "ADAMUZ, Spain, Jan 19 (Reuters) - At least 40 people have died in southern Spain after a high-speed train derailed and collided with an oncoming one on Sunday night in one of the worst railway accidents in Europe in 80 years.\n\nTwelve were in intensive care after the accident near Adamuz in the province ​of Cordoba, about 360 km (223 miles) south of Madrid, according to emergency services. Experts say a faulty rail joint might be key to determining the cause of the crash.\n\n\"The train tipped ‌to one side... then everything went dark, and all I heard was screams,\" said Ana Garcia Aranda, 26, who was being treated at a Red Cross centre in Adamuz.\n\nLimping and with plasters across her face, she described how fellow passengers dragged her out ‌of the train covered in blood. Firefighters rescued her pregnant sister from the wreckage and an ambulance took them both to hospital.\n\n\"There were people who were fine and others who were very, very badly injured... you knew they were going to die, and you couldn’t do anything,\" she said.\n\nA total of 43 reports of missing persons have been filed so far at police headquarters in Huelva, Madrid, Málaga, Córdoba and Seville, officials said.\n\nREMOTE LOCATION COMPLICATES RESCUE\n\nThe collision occurred in a hilly, olive-growing region accessible only by a single-track road, making it difficult for ambulances to reach the area, Iñigo Vila, national emergency director at the Spanish Red Cross, told Reuters.\n\nThe Andalusia region's ⁠President Juan Manuel Moreno said at least 40 people had perished, and ‌emergency crews faced difficulties bringing in the heavy equipment needed to lift the wreckage and reach those still lying beneath it.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro Sanchez cancelled his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and Transport Minister Oscar Puente visited the site on Monday.\n\nPolice drone footage showed how the trains, which were carrying ‍527 people, came to a standstill 500 metres apart. One train's carriage was split in two, and the locomotive was crushed like a tin can.\n\nExperts studying the crash site found a broken joint on the rails, which created a gap between the rail sections that widened as trains continued to travel on the track, according to a source briefed on initial investigations.\n\nThat faulty joint could prove important in identifying the cause of the accident, the source said.\n\n'INTERACTION BETWEEN THE ​TRACK AND THE VEHICLE'\n\nIgnacio Barron, head of Spain's Commission of Investigation of Rail Accidents (CIAF), said on RTVE: \"What always plays a part in a derailment is the interaction between the track and the vehicle, ‌and that is what the commission is currently (looking into).\"\n\nPaqui, an Adamuz resident who rushed to help rescue survivors with her husband, said he had \"found a dead child inside, another child calling for his mother. You're never ready to see something like this.\"\n\nPolice said they had opened an office in Cordoba for relatives to provide DNA samples to help identify the dead.\n\nThe Iryo train was travelling at 110 kph from Malaga to Madrid when it derailed, Renfe President Álvaro Fernandez Heredia said on radio station Cadena Ser.\n\nTwenty seconds later, the second train, heading to Huelva at 200 kph, either collided with the final two carriages of the Iryo train or with debris on the line, he said. The Iryo train lost a wheel that has not yet been located.\n\nCRASH OCCURRED IN 'STRANGE CONDITIONS'\n\nIt was too early to talk about the cause, but it happened ⁠in \"strange conditions,\" Fernandez Heredia said, adding that human error was virtually ruled out.\n\nThe death toll was among the 20 highest ​from a train crash in Europe in 80 years, according to Eurostat data, and the highest in Spain since 2013, when ​a train derailed in the northwestern city of Santiago de Compostela, killing 80.\n\nSpanish train drivers had warned state-owned rail infrastructure administrator Adif of “severe wear and tear” on the Madrid-Andalusia line and others, according to a letter seen by Reuters sent to Adif by train drivers' union Semaf in August and urging stricter speed restrictions.\n\nAdif had no ‍immediate comment.\n\nThe Iryo train, a Frecciarossa 1000, was under ⁠four years old and the railway line near Adamuz was renovated last May, Puente said. Iryo said the train was last inspected on January 15.\n\nSpain's high-speed railway network is the largest in Europe and second-largest in the world after China with 3,622 km of tracks, according to Adif.\n\nThe government was criticised last year for a series of delays to high-speed rail, caused by power ⁠outages and the theft of copper cables from the lines.\n\nSpain opened up the network to private competition in 2020 in a bid to offer low-cost alternatives to Renfe's Ave trains.\n\nIryo is a joint venture between Italian state railway operator Ferrovie dello Stato, airline ‌Air Nostrum and Spanish infrastructure investment fund Globalvia.",

    "description": "Amid severe geomagnetic storm conditions, the northern lights could be visible from even more states on Jan. 19",
    "fullText": "A strong geomagnetic storm could spark auroras in up to 24 U.S. states overnight Monday, Jan. 19, into early Tuesday, Jan. 20, according to NOAA forecasts\n\nAn Earth-directed coronal mass ejection from an X1.9 solar flare is expected to impact Earth’s magnetic field, potentially triggering G3 to G4 storm conditions\n\nClear skies following the new moon could make this event especially photogenic, with cameras capturing colors not visible to the naked eye\n\nLook up, because the sky’s about to put on a show!\n\nIf you’ve ever wanted to witness the northern lights without leaving the U.S., this could be your moment.\n\nThe aurora borealis (northern lights) is caused by geomagnetic storms, which occur when charged particles from the sun collide with gases in Earth's atmosphere, creating brilliant waves of light in the sky. Still, their visibility depends on several factors, including intensity and location.\n\nA surge of intense solar activity arrives just in time for January’s dark winter skies, setting the stage for auroras to push unusually far south across the country tonight, Jan. 19 and into the early hours of Tuesday, Jan. 20, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Space Weather Prediction Center.\n\nThis isn’t a subtle glow reserved for the Arctic Circle. This is a rare, high-impact space weather event that could bring auroras to mid-latitude regions just as the night sky reaches its darkest point.\n\nAccording to NOAA forecasters, Earth is bracing for a strong to potentially severe geomagnetic storm as charged solar particles slam into our planet’s magnetic field.\n\nThe trigger? A massive X1.9-class solar flare erupted from the sun, followed by an Earth-directed full halo (CME) coronal mass ejection, the kind that significantly increases the odds of intense auroral activity.\n\nThis is one of those nights where space weather, the lunar cycle and winter darkness conspire to create something extraordinary.\n\nHere’s exactly when to look, where to look and how to make the most of this stellar event.\n\nThe northern lights are expected overnight Monday, Jan. 19, into early Tuesday, Jan. 20, as Earth is impacted by a powerful geomagnetic storm.\n\nForecasters are predicting strong G3 conditions, with the potential for the storm to intensify to G4 (severe) on NOAA’s five-level scale.\n\nThis activity is being driven by a full-halo coronal mass ejection (CME), a massive cloud of charged solar particles released after an X1.9-class solar flare erupted from the sun on Sunday, Jan. 18.\n\nGiven that the CME is directed towards Earth, it has a higher chance of disturbing its magnetic field once it arrives. According to NOAA, “Higher storm levels are possible as early as the end of the day” on Mondaym Jan. 19.\n\nIf conditions peak as forecasted, auroras could be visible across up to 24 U.S. states, extending from the Canadian border down into mid-latitude regions.\n\nThe best chances of viewing will be in northern areas, including Alaska, Northern Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, New York and Maine.\n\nIf the storm reaches G3 strength or higher, however, sighting could stretch further south into Oregon, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire.\n\nSpace weather is notoriously difficult to predict, as everything depends on the speed and orientation of the solar wind.\n\nFor real-time updates, be sure to monitor NOAA’s 30-minute aurora forecast, SpaceWeatherLive.com or aurora-tracking apps such as Aurora Now, My Aurora Forecast, SpaceWeatherLive or Glendale Aurora.\n\nOne key indicator is the Bz component of the interplanetary magnetic field. When Bz turns southward, solar energy can more easily penetrate Earth’s magnetosphere. A sustained southward Bz of -5 nanoteslas or stronger often signals an imminent auroral display.\n\nDark skies will be especially favorable during this window, as the activity follows a new moon, meaning little to no moonlight to interfere with visibility.\n\nFrom northern U.S. states, any auroras that appear may glow low along the northern horizon.\n\nThe best part about the northern lights is that you can also make fun memories in the process. Your smartphone is more than enough, too! All you have to do is go to settings, turn on Night Mode and point your camera lens towards the sky.\n\nIf you’re a more seasoned skywatcher and happen to have a DSLR or mirrorless camera, grab a tripod and set your camera to manual mode. Don’t forget to stay warm!",

    "fullText": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. announced Monday the discovery of a new natural gas deposit near the disputed South China Sea, which could shield his country from a potential power crisis.\n\nThe “significant discovery\" northwest off Palawan province, close to an existing gas field in waters adjacent to the critical waterway, could eventually supply power to more than 5.7 million households or nearly 200,000 schools for a year, Marcos said, adding further tests and another drilling in the area would be done “to pursue more potential gas resources.\"\n\nThe undersea reservoir is estimated to contain about 98 billion cubic feet (2.7 billion cubic meters) of gas. Initial tests showed 60 million cubic feet (1.6 million cubic meters) of gas could be extracted daily from the well, Marcos said, without providing further details, including when commercial production could start.\n\n“This helps Malampaya’s contribution and strengthens our domestic gas supply for many years to come,” Marcos said. “Aside from the natural gas, the discovery also includes condensate, which is a high-value liquid fuel.”\n\nThe new gas deposit, called Malampaya East 1, was discovered by a consortium about 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) east of the main Malampaya gas field, where commercial gas production started more than two decades ago and was projected to considerably decline in a few years.\n\n“We're proud that Filipinos led this drilling and, more importantly, they completed it without any accident or environmental incidents,” Marcos said.\n\nThe Malampaya gas-to-power facility has generated more than 20% of Luzon's electricity, the most populous northern Philippine island region. In 2023, Marcos extended an exploration contract in Malampaya by 15 years.\n\nExperts have predicted Malampaya could run out of gas in a few years, sparking fears of a potential power crisis in Luzon, where the bustling capital and main financial and business district is located.\n\nThe offshore gas field lies within the country’s Exclusive Economic Zone of the Philippines, a 200-nautical-mile (370-kilometer) stretch of water from a country’s coastline where it has exclusive rights to explore and harness resources under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n\nPhilippine efforts to explore for oil and gas in another offshore region, the Reed Bank, have been stalled for years because of opposition from Beijing, which claims sovereignty over the area along with most of the South China Sea. The Reed Bank also lies in the fringes of the South China Sea west of the Philippine island province of Palawan.\n\nChina has opposed Vietnam’s oil and gas exploration in the disputed region. Beijing claims virtually the entire South China Sea and has reinforced its presence, including coast guard and naval patrols in the disputed waterway in recent years.\n\nMalaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also been involved in the region's long-simmering territorial standoffs.",

    "description": "Olympic swimmer Katie Ledecky generally follows a whole food diet, focusing on homemade dinners and veggie omelets.",
    "fullText": "For being the most decorated female swimmer in Olympic history, Katie Ledecky's philosophy around nutrition is surprisingly relaxed.\n\nFor one, she doesn't strictly track her daily protein intake. \"Over the years, I've kind of learned what I need because it does sometimes change, if I'm doing well or if I don't feel like I'm doing well,\" Ledecky, 28, told Business Insider.\n\nSince graduating from Stanford in 2020, her class-free schedule also gives her more time to rest and cook her own meals between her two blocks of daily training sessions. To keep things simple, she eats mostly the same breakfasts every day and usually has leftovers from the previous night's dinner for lunch.\n\n\"I just focus on things that I can prep easily,\" Ledecky said. \"My morning is pretty much set. I don't even have to think about it very much.\"\n\nLedecky shared what she typically eats in a day to fuel for and recover from long training sessions.\n\nLedecky typically wakes up at 5:00 a.m. for her first practice of the day, a 6 to 8 a.m. block involving swimming and strength training.\n\nBefore she heads out, she eats \"something quick and not anything too heavy,\" usually an oatmeal packet and a banana. The carbohydrates from both provide an energy boost.\n\nRight after practice, Ledecky usually has a Core Power protein shake, for whom she's a brand ambassador for, to tide her over until she gets home for breakfast.\n\n\"I try to get a full meal in within an hour of when I finish practice,\" she said, as the body is best optimized for nutrient intake after a hard workout. \"That was something I learned from a young age.\"\n\nBreakfast is usually two eggs, scrambled or cooked in an omelet. Ledecky, who is partnered with the egg brand Eggland's Best, said she grew up eating Eggland's eggs in particular since she was a kid, continuing to include them as a staple of her diet as an adult.\n\nShe loves making a vegetable omelet because of how easy it is to add extra fiber-rich ingredients like spinach, arugula, or tomatoes. She usually tops with cheese like mozzarella or cheddar.\n\nShe always adds a side of toast and fruit. \"So I'm kind of getting a good balance there of protein and carbs and everything that I need,\" she said.\n\nLedecky has a late lunch or larger snack before her second practice of the day, another two-hour training block in the afternoon.\n\n\"Usually, that's leftovers from dinner the night before, or a salad, or some chicken,\" she said.\n\nThroughout the day, she also likes to snack on berries, which offer fiber and extra nutrients.\n\n\"I love blueberries, raspberries, strawberries,\" she said. \"I always feel good when I'm having a mix of fruit throughout the day as well in between all my meals.\"\n\nAfter practice, Ledecky makes dinner — her most involved meal-prep of the day. She focuses on protein-rich meals, which help with building muscle and recovery.\n\n\"That's kind of when I mix up a little bit more,\" she said. \"Might be steak, might be chicken, might be a hamburger, might be pasta.\"\n\nLedecky has a few favorite desserts in rotation.\n\nShe keeps frozen yogurt and ice cream in her freezer whenever she wants a scoop at night. Sometimes, she goes to her favorite bakery in Florida for a pastry.\n\n\"I treat myself every now and then,\" she said. \"It just kind of depends on what I'm craving.\"",

    "description": "China faces a shrinking population and record-low birth rates, challenging economic growth and straining pensions and healthcare.",
    "fullText": "China's population is shrinking — and the decline is accelerating.\n\nThe country's population fell for the fourth year in a row, falling by 3.39 million to 1.405 billion people in 2025, according to new data from China's National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nIts birth rate hit its lowest level on record — 5.63 per 1,000 people — since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, while the death rate climbed to 8.04 per 1,000 people. The number of babies born in the country dropped to 7.92 million, down from 9.54 million in 2024.\n\nThe United Nations predicted in 2024 that China's population could fall as low as 663 million — less than half its current population — by 2100, if birth rates continue to decline and immigration stays low.\n\nIf things don't change, China's shrinking and aging population poses serious long-term risks for the country's economy. It could mean a much smaller workforce, weaker demand for goods and services such as housing, and mounting pressure on pension and healthcare systems. A smaller working-age population in China could also hurt the global economy, which has relied on China's booming productivity and economic growth.\n\nChina reported that its economy grew by 5% last year, meeting its official growth target. The country also logged a record trade surplus in 2025, despite President Donald Trump's tariffs. However, it's struggling with soaring unemployment among young people and an ongoing oversupply of housing, which has tanked property values, hurting consumer spending and slowing investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, and real estate.\n\nThe population of mainland China began shrinking in 2022, when it declined by 850,000 people after years of falling birth rates. That year marked the first time the country's population had declined since a major famine killed an estimated 30 million people during Mao Zedong's failed Great Leap Forward in the early 1960s.\n\nChina's demographic challenges have unfolded faster than the government once anticipated. The government has loosened previous restrictions to counter the effect, dropping the one-child policy a decade ago to allow families to have two children. Five years ago, it began allowing three children.\n\nIn recent years, the government has raced to lift the fertility rate by offering financial incentives to parents, tightening access to abortions, and, more recently, imposing new taxes on contraceptives, including birth control and condoms. There is little evidence these efforts have been successful at lifting birth rates.\n\nThough its situation is serious, China is far from alone in declining fertility. Birth rates are falling in countries around the world, particularly in higher-income nations, including the US. Fertility rates below the \"replacement rate\" of 2.1 births per woman are \"becoming the global norm,\" according to a report by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. This has sparked similar economic concerns about a shrinking workforce and a growing elderly population.\n\nThe US has a slightly rosier population forecast than other major economies, as it's set to grow slightly due to immigration.",

    "description": "Ina Garten has dozens of delicious soup recipes. Her tomato soup with grilled cheese croutons is super easy to make and perfect for any age.",
    "fullText": "After cooking my way through Ina Garten's comforting pastas, energizing breakfasts, and delectable desserts, it was time for a new challenge.\n\nAs George Costanza would say, I was ready to \"shift into soup mode.\"\n\nGarten has dozens of soup recipes, and I've been slowly making my way through her repertoire. Each soup in this ranking is delicious — what else would you expect from the Barefoot Contessa? — but I definitely have some clear favorites.\n\nGarten's minestrone soup appears in her 2012 cookbook \"Foolproof.\" In the recipe's description, she calls it an \"incredibly hearty winter soup\" that \"falls somewhere between a soup and a stew.\"\n\nThe soup is packed with tons of vegetables — baby spinach, butternut squash, celery, carrots, garlic, and onion — plus cannellini beans, pancetta, pesto, Parmesan, and fresh thyme.\n\nIt requires a lot of chopping and prep, but all those veggies provide plenty of heft.\n\nFull transparency, if I had to rank my favorite soups in the world, minestrone would always be at the bottom of the list. Most minestrone soups I've tried have been lackluster and forgettable, but Garten's version is a commendable effort.\n\nThe chopped tomatoes and pancetta bring some richness to the broth, while the rainbow of veggies provides plenty of color and texture. I loved the pops of freshness from the spinach and thyme, and the salty kick from the Parmesan on top.\n\nWhile it's not my favorite Barefoot Contessa recipe, Garten's winter minestrone soup is healthy and hearty.\n\nHow to make Ina Garten's winter minestrone soup.\n\nGarten loves putting a new twist on classic recipes, and her Italian wedding soup is no different. Featured in Garten's 2008 cookbook \"Back to Basics,\" the recipe features meatballs made with a mixture of ground chicken and chicken sausage instead of the traditional beef or pork.\n\nThe recipe also includes small pasta — Garten recommends tubettini or stars — carrots, celery, fresh dill, baby spinach, and her homemade chicken stock.\n\nGarten says using homemade chicken stock \"makes all the difference in the world\" for this recipe, and I definitely agree.\n\nHer delicious stock infuses this dish with depth, giving the broth richness without making it heavy. This allows the soup to taste light and fresh, especially with the added burst of dill. The chicken meatballs were full of great flavor. I just wish I had made them a tad smaller!\n\nGarten's Italian wedding soup isn't as memorable as other recipes on this list, but it's a great dish for rainy nights.\n\nHow to make Ina Garten's Italian wedding soup.\n\nGarten made traditional chili for 20 years at the famous specialty food store that launched her cooking career (and gave her the iconic \"Barefoot Contessa\" nickname). But she decided to update the chili with chicken to make it lighter, which became even more popular than the original dish.\n\nThe soup — which is featured in Garten's 2001 cookbook \"Barefoot Contessa Parties!\" — features chicken breasts, red and yellow bell peppers, onion, garlic, fresh basil, plus toppings including green onions, sour cream, and grated cheddar cheese.\n\nWhen I'm craving chili, I usually whip up this recipe with ground beef that my fiancé and I have been making for years. But if you're looking for something a little lighter, Garten's recipe is a great substitute.\n\nThe tender and juicy roasted chicken pairs deliciously with the rich tomato flavor of the broth, and I enjoyed the crunchy texture from the bell peppers and the green onions on top. The sour cream also adds a nice hit of creaminess and acidity.\n\n\"This chili is reminiscent of a chicken tortilla soup, but it's so much heartier!\" my friend Kayla said after I made her a bowl. \"It makes you feel so warm and cozy.\"\n\nHow to make Ina Garten's chicken chili.\n\nGarten elevates her version of tomato soup — which also appears in \"Foolproof\" — with the addition of orzo, saffron threads, and grilled cheese croutons.\n\nThis is one of the quickest Barefoot Contessa soup recipes. There's very minimal prep, and the entire dish is ready in just 50 minutes!\n\nTomato and grilled cheese are a pairing as classic as peanut butter and jelly or macaroni and cheese, and turning the sandwich into bite-sized croutons is an inspired choice. I loved how they injected each sip of soup with a salty and satisfying blast of gooey cheesiness.\n\nI used Garten's homemade chicken stock for this recipe, which helps imbue the broth with so much flavor despite being on the stove for less than an hour. It's light and rich, with a silky texture I couldn't get enough of. This is the only tomato soup that I crave now.\n\nHow to make Ina Garten's tomato soup with grilled cheese croutons.\n\nAs you can see, Garten clearly loves to whip up Italian soup recipes. The Barefoot Contessa version of ravioli en brodo appears in \"Go-To Dinners,\" Garten's most recent cookbook.\n\nThe rustic recipe features homemade chicken stock, fresh or frozen cheese ravioli, carrots, celery, fennel, dill, lemon juice, and Parmesan cheese.\n\nGarten's ravioli en brodo turned me into a true homemade chicken stock convert. With its help, the broth in this soup truly tastes like liquid gold. It's light but silky, rich and savory. The dill and lemon add an extra burst of brightness, while the ravioli brings in that comforting cheesiness.\n\nI dream about this soup so much, I think it's safe to say I prefer it over chicken noodle. And now I make a huge pot of homemade chicken stock every winter.\n\nHow to make Ina Garten's ravioli en brodo.\n\nGarten was inspired to make a chicken pot pie soup after she spotted one on an airport menu.\n\n\"It was actually harder to make than it sounded — my first few attempts just tasted like chicken pot pie filling, not soup,\" she wrote in her 2020 cookbook \"Modern Comfort Food.\"\n\n\"This one, though, hit all the right comforting notes, with good chicken stock, roasted chicken, and puff pastry croutons,\" Garten added.\n\nThe soup also features carrots, leeks, fennel, garlic, pearl onions, peas, fresh tarragon and parsley, plus some cream sherry.\n\nI wish I knew which airport restaurant had the chicken pot pie soup on its menu so I could personally thank them for inspiring Garten's version, which has become one of my favorite comfort meals.\n\nThis recipe keeps the spirit of pot pie alive with deliciously juicy and tender chicken surrounded by fresh and flavorful veggies with every sip. The puff pastry croutons were an easy and quick addition, and they tasted incredible after soaking up the delicious broth.\n\nWhen one of my loved ones is sick, this is always the dish that I make for them. It's truly soup for the soul.\n\nHere's how to make Ina Garten's chicken pot pie soup.",

Both designs were reportedly seen Saturday on the heads of protesters in Nuuk and Copenhagen.\n\nAll profits go to support a Greenlandic children's charity, Schøtt said.\n\nOther riffs on the original MAGA phrasing have also cropped up in the first year of Trump's second term, with hats saying \"Make America Gay Again,\" \"Make NATO Great Again,\" and \"Make America Normal Again\" available from various shops online.",

    "description": "After moving from the US to the UK, a mom reflects on the lasting grief and strength that come with living far from her own mother.",
    "fullText": "I just said goodbye to my mom after having three weeks with her. She made the journey from North Carolina to see me, her oldest daughter, in Wales.\n\nFifteen years ago, I met a Welsh boy, fell in love, and moved my just-starting-out adult life to the UK, not having the foresight to realize what a huge decision this was.\n\nHow do you know, at just 22, that making a transatlantic move will not just change the course of the next couple of years, but of your entire life?\n\nI remember how tearful my mom had been upon my leaving all those years ago. I, too, of course, cried, but she really cried. She understood, given her years of life lived, I would almost definitely never be moving back. My goodbye, now looking back, was fleeting; hers was permanent.\n\nIn the early days of living in Wales, I remember calling her on Skype once a week, because we didn't have constant access to each other as we do now. I was often crying, telling her how hard I found adulting.\n\nWhen I had my three kids, each two years apart, I felt a deep longing for my mom. Not someone to do the laundry, clean the dishes, or have the baby for me in the night. I could do all of this — I was and still am fiercely independent.\n\nI wanted her to just sit with me. And I know she wanted exactly the same.\n\nWe both felt the pangs of being apart, because it only feels fitting that the woman who carried and gave birth to you should also be there when you do the same. And to be there in those months after, when postnatal depression and severe fatigue kick in.\n\nI got through even these wearisome years of having very young babies and toddlers, not unscathed, but I made it.\n\nSince then, my conversations with her have become more frequent. We text daily on WhatsApp and ring each other a few times a week. I tell her nearly everything, and want to hear all that's happening with her, both of us exchanging stories from our days and weeks.\n\nAnd this oftentimes feels like enough to maintain a beautiful connection. It is our pattern to maintain a close relationship, although we only see each other, if we're lucky, once a year.\n\nBut even this in-person connection is never guaranteed. Due to the pandemic and then my high-risk pregnancy, I wasn't able to visit the US for nearly five years, and in that time, she was only able to visit twice.\n\nWhen I do travel to the US to visit, it now costs me my ticket plus three others, not an easy feat on a budget.\n\nFor her to travel here, she, a 63-year-old woman whose back isn't brilliant, has to make a very long flight and then a car ride, first here and then back.\n\nSeeing each other isn't easy. It isn't popping in for Sunday dinner after church. It isn't nipping over to celebrate a holiday or birthday.\n\nThe hardest thing of all about living in a different country, separated by an ocean and a five-hour time zone, is that when I've had a crap day, other than my husband, she is the first person I want to talk to. And I can't always do that, although she makes every effort to be available when she can.\n\nSo for those three weeks over Christmas when she was here, we both soaked up each other's company, not knowing when we'd have it again. Although I must admit we annoyed each other for the first couple of days, trying to adapt to each other's rhythms and ways after being apart for so long.\n\nAnd when she left, it felt like I walked into a wall that hit me with all the reminders of how hard it is living away from my mom.\n\nI had a little cry, as I often do once she leaves, and then I did what she has always taught me by example — I counted my blessings, recounted how this is making me strong, and moved on.\n\nI have a loving mom. I have access to technology that lets me stay in frequent contact with her.\n\nAnd as much as living away from her wouldn't be a choice I'd quickly make, now that I'm older and wiser, it has made me strong and resilient. I've had to learn to do so much on my own, exactly as she had to do with my sister and me growing up.\n\nHerself a strong woman, she raised a strong woman.",

    "description": "Ukraine is using ground robots and flying drones to take on Russia. One robot maker was surprised when soldiers combined them to be more effective.",
    "fullText": "A Ukrainian ground robot maker said soldiers surprised it with the ways they used its robots, including using flying drones to drop them closer to Russian positions.\n\nUkraine has a growing army of ground robots that can evacuate the injured, blow up inside or fire on Russian positions, lay or remove mines, carry cargo, and gather intelligence. It's a battlefield technology sector where Ukraine is rapidly experimenting and Western militaries are paying close attention.\n\nArk Robotics is one of the companies supplying these systems, making a suite of autonomous robots used by more than 20 Ukrainian brigades.\n\nIts CEO, Achi, told Business Insider that Ukrainian soldiers have demonstrated \"some really crazy ideas I would never imagine in my life that you would do.\" He spoke using a pseudonym as a security precaution.\n\nOne example involved pairing a small Ark ground robot with a larger aerial drone, which carried the robot forward before \"dropping it out of the sky.\"\n\nHe said that when he first saw it, his immediate reaction was: \"What the fuck? Why?\" Then it quickly made sense.\n\n\"The goal is simple: get a tool on the ground fast without putting a person in harm's way.\"\n\nUltimately, he found, \"it works.\"\n\nHe said this use \"wasn't the robot's original design, but give smart, motivated people a tool, and they'll find new ways to use it — and squeeze more out of it.\"\n\nThe \"soldiers keep surprising us,\" Achi said. \"They are very creative.\"\n\nAerial drones are available in significant numbers and are able to cover great distances quickly. Using them to transport ground robots helps overcome some of the weaknesses and vulnerabilities of the robots, which have notable advantages once deployed.\n\nSmall ground robots can do things that are sometimes more challenging for aerial drones. They can drive into Russian dugouts or other positions to gather intelligence or deliver explosives. They can also be more precise when firing mounted weapons, and they are easier to conceal near Russian positions than aerial drones, which are noisy and have to hover overhead.\n\nAchi described the tactic as one example of how quickly battlefield technology and tactics are evolving in Ukraine.\n\n\"There is so much innovation happening right now that it's hard to comprehend,\" he said.\n\nOther arms makers have also been surprised at how Ukraine's forces have used their weaponry. Kuldar Väärsi, the founder and CEO of Estonia's Milrem Robotics, which makes ground robots used by Ukraine's forces, previously told BI that Ukrainian soldiers have used them in ways he hadn't expected.\n\n\"The creativity of Ukrainian troops is really admirable,\" he said, adding that the way the company's robots are used in Ukraine has led it to make changes in their design.\n\nCompanies with products deployed in Ukraine are seeking constant feedback from soldiers, often through group chats, video calls, and direct visits to front-line units.\n\nAchi said the challenge for Ark Robotics is keeping pace with new ideas without changing products so rapidly that large-scale production becomes impossible.\n\nArk needs to experiment constantly and stay aware of what's happening on the battlefield, but focusing on the wrong trends would mean sacrificing both mass and quality.\n\n\"This iteration cycle is insane. I've never seen anything like it,\" he said. It can mean making five different changes to a product in a few weeks, all while trying to make sure that you \"lead your whole engineering team the right way.\"\n\nAchi said that even the importance of ground robots surprised him. In 2023, they were a \"random side project,\" he said, but Ark has leaned into the technology.\n\nArk Robotics also develops aerial drones and is making a system called Frontier that it says will enable thousands of aerial drones and ground robots to work together effectively with minimal human involvement.\n\nUkraine's defense industry has boomed since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022, and its Western partners have been closely watching, impressed at how quickly it can develop and make weaponry.\n\nGround robots still make up only a small fraction of Ukraine's drone usage, but it's a growing area, with more companies entering the space and existing ones growing.\n\nAchi said he believes Ukraine is moving toward a future in which robots handle a significant share of front-line logistics. His long-term view is that sending people into vehicles near the front lines will increasingly make little sense.",

    "description": "US tariffs under Donald Trump have been paid almost entirely by Americans, with foreign exporters paying for only 4%, a German study found.",
    "fullText": "A favorite tool of President Donald Trump has been costing Americans, according to new study.\n\nThe brunt of US tariffs — 96% — have been paid by US buyers, research from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank, found, while about 4% of the tariff burden was paid by foreign exporters.\n\n\"American importers and consumers bear nearly all the cost,\" the researchers said of the tariffs.\n\nThe study, published Monday, said that the $200 billion increase in customs revenue that the US government raised in 2025 was a \"tax paid almost entirely by Americans.\"\n\nThe research contradicts Trump's messaging that tariff costs would not be paid by Americans, but by other countries and overseas exporters. The president's aggressive tariff policy launched last year placed additional duties on dozens of trade partners, including China, India, and the European Union.\n\nThe Kiel Institute study examined more than 25 million shipment records, worth nearly $4 trillion, between January 2024 and November 2025. The researchers found that there was a \"near-complete pass-through\" of the tariffs.\n\n\"US import prices rise nearly one-for-one with tariffs, while trade volumes contract,\" the study said.\n\nThe findings echo other research that has found Americans are paying for tariffs, including from Harvard Business School and The Budget Lab at Yale. Analysts at Deutsche Bank and Bank of America also said last year that Americans were the ones paying for the tariffs.\n\nThe Kiel study said American importers and wholesalers are first hit by the tariff cost, followed by manufacturers and retailers, all of which must choose whether to absorb the tariff or pass it on to their customers. American consumers are then hit by increased prices, both on imported goods or American-made products that use foreign inputs. There's been more limited availability of goods in the US, the researchers found.\n\nTrump has continued to use tariffs, saying on Saturday that he would impose additional tariffs on Denmark and other European countries unless they agree to a deal that would transfer Greenland to the US.\n\nMany of Trump's tariff policies could also be undone. The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on the legality of a host of Trump's tariffs that were instituted under an emergency national security law. Trump has said the US would be \"screwed\" if the tariffs are overturned.",

    "description": "The stock market flashed five warning signs before the dot-com bubble popped in the early 2000s, strategists at Goldman Sachs said.",
    "fullText": "Markets are worried about shades of 1999 in today's tech-investing landscape, and while there's a lot of debate about whether AI is a bubble, there are a few signals from history that show what, specifically, investors should be looking out for.\n\nStrategists at Goldman Sachs said they believe the market's AI frenzy risks mirroring the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s.\n\nStocks don't look like they're in their 1999 moment yet, Dominic Wilson, a senior advisor on the bank's global markets research team, and Vickie Chang, a macro research strategist, wrote in a note to clients on Sunday. But the risks that the AI boom will look a lot like the 2000s era craze appear to be growing, they said.\n\n\"We see a growing risk that the imbalances that built up in the 1990s will become more visible as the AI investment boom extends. There have been echoes of the inflection point in the 1990s boom lately,\" the bank wrote, adding that the AI trade now looked the way tech stocks did in 1997, several years before the bubble burst.\n\nWilson and Chang flagged several warning signs leading up to the dot-com crash in the early 2000s that investors should be on the lookout for.\n\nInvestment spending on tech equipment and software rose to \"unusually high levels\" in the 90s. That peaked in 2000, when non-residential investment in the telecom and tech sector rose to around 15% of US GDP.\n\nInvestment spending began to tumble in the months leading up to the dot-com crash, per Goldman's analysis.\n\n\"Highly valued asset prices thus had significant consequences for real spending decisions,\" the strategists said.\n\nInvestors have been growing wary of mega-cap tech firms' spending spree on AI this year. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple are on track to spend around $349 billion on capex in 2025.\n\nCorporate profits reached a peak around 1997 before beginning to decline.\n\n\"Profitability peaked well before the boom ended,\" Wilson and Chang wrote. \"While reported profit margins were more robust, declining profitability in the macro data in the later years of the boom came alongside accelerating equity prices.\"\n\nCorporate profits look strong at the moment. The blended net profit margin in the S&P 500 for the third quarter is around 13.1%, above the five-year average of 12.1%, according to FactSet.\n\nCompanies grew increasingly indebted in the lead-up to the dot-com crash. Corporate debt as a percentage of profits peaked in 2001, right as the bubble was bursting, Goldman's analysis shows.\n\n\"The combination of rising investment and falling profitability pushed the corporate sector financial balance — the difference between savings and investment — into deficit,\" the strategists said.\n\nSome of mega-cap tech firms' spending on AI has been funded debt. Meta, for instance, raised $30 billion in bonds in late October as it doubled down on its AI spending plans.\n\nMost firms today, though, look like they're financing capex with free cash flow, Goldman added. The percentage of corporate debt relative to profits also looks significantly lower than it did at the peak of the internet bubble.\n\nThe Fed was in the midst of its rate-cutting cycle in the late 90s, one factor that helped juice the stock market.\n\n\"Lower rates and capital inflows added fuel to the equity market,\" Goldman wrote.\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points at its October policy meeting. Investors are expecting the central bank to issue another 25 basis-point cut in December, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nOther market pros, like Ray Dalio, have warned that the Fed's easing cycle could help inflate a bubble in markets.\n\nIn the 1990s, these warning signs appeared at least two years before the dot-com bubble actually burst, Wilson and Chang said, adding that they believed the AI trade still had room to run.\n\nThis story was originally published in November 2025.",

    "title": "I went from fine dining to owning a fast-casual chain. Here are 4 misconceptions about the restaurant business.",
    "description": "Hady Kfoury, founder of Naya, said working in fine-dining and fast-casual restaurants made him realize some common misconceptions about the business.",
    "fullText": "This is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Hady Kfoury, the founder of Naya, a fast-casual Lebanese-inspired food chain with more than 40 locations on the East Coast. Naya plans to have 200 locations nationwide by 2030. This story has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI studied hospitality in Switzerland and then came to New York to work under celebrity chefs, Daniel Boulud and François Payard, so I had experience in fine dining. When I decided to open the first Naya in 2008, that was more or less my comfort zone.\n\nA week after we launched, we got an amazing article in the New York Times and then we were packed for lunch and dinner. It definitely helped prevent us from shutting down after a few months.\n\nA couple of years in, we realized the food worked incredibly well in a faster and more accessible format. If you go to a Lebanese restaurant, you have all these mezze in the middle of the table, like a plate with a variety of dips and vegetables, and you're putting scoops on your plate. That's how we eat usually. So that's why I shifted my focus into a fast-casual model.\n\nToday, we have 44 restaurants and we are riding the wave of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine in general. It's definitely become mainstream, which is totally different than almost 20 years ago when I started the business.\n\nAs we scale, I've found there are four major misconceptions about the restaurant business.\n\nA lot of people think fast-casual restaurants are easy. It is not easy. Serving more guests at a faster pace doesn't mean it's a simple effort; it means you should master your systems and consistency at scale, possibly even more rigor than in fine dining.\n\nThe biggest challenge we have is that you're on an assembly line. You're not cooking per order. It's a problem for any restaurant with a service line. How do you plan to rotate food in a certain way, and to cook it a certain amount, so the food remains fresh and not overcooked?\n\nMy R&D doesn't stop. It keeps me up at night thinking about how we can keep improving what we do. And any change you make to improve something, you're rolling it out at 44 restaurants, so you have to be very mindful and careful.\n\nGrowing only works when the business fundamentals — training, supply chain, quality control — are built to handle it repeatedly. Growing without readiness is chaotic.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2020, I grew Naya to seven restaurants without any partners because all I cared about was being profitable and having a great team in place. Growth only works when you have those fundamentals. In 2020, I partnered with a private-equity firm, which was initially scary, but the rules were clear from day one that we would prioritize those fundamentals.\n\nSome people think cutting corners gets you a more profitable bottom line, but that is not the case. Cutting costs often undermines guest trust. You lose the customer trust, and the brands that endure are the ones that deliver authenticity, quality, and transparency every time.\n\nWe're trying to be very affordable, and we fall somewhere in the middle of the category, but I will never drop quality. I recently partnered with Pat LaFrieda, one of the best high-end butchers in the tristate. Even with our vegetables, we try to get deliveries three to four times per week rather than two times where you could get cheaper products.\n\nPeople think that it's all about the food, but people matter so much too. What keeps guests coming back and what keeps your team thriving is a culture of service, training, and retention.\n\nI take extremely good care of my team. Most of our general managers are grown within the company and we have very low staff turnover.\n\nGreat food is really important, but there's a people component to it that you can't avoid.",

    "description": "A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.  U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., concluded that the Department of Homeland Security didn't violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.\n\nCobb stressed that she wasn't ruling on whether the new policy passes legal muster. Rather, she said, plaintiffs' attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong \"procedural vehicle\" to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn't subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs' favor.\n\nPlaintiffs' lawyers asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month — three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis.\n\nLast month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.\n\nA day after Good’s death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs’ lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn't disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.\n\nOn Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.\n\n“The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” she wrote.\n\nDemocracy Forward spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said they were reviewing the judge's latest order.\n\n“We will continue to use every legal tool available to stop the administration’s efforts to hide from congressional oversight,” she said in a statement.\n\nTwelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump’s administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.\n\nA law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes. Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds are being used to implement the latest notice policy.\n\n\"Appropriations are not a game. They are a law,\" plaintiffs’ attorney Christine Coogle said during a hearing Wednesday.\n\nJustice Department attorney Amber Richer said the Jan. 8 policy signed by Noem is distinct from the policies that Cobb suspended last month.\n\n“This is really a challenge to a new policy,” Richer said.\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS’s annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.\n\n“This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,” the lawyers wrote.\n\nGovernment attorneys have said it’s merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments last month.\n\n“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump has vowed to \"100%\" follow through on his threat to impose tariffs on European countries who oppose his demand to take control of Greenland.\n\nEuropean allies have rallied around Greenland's sovereignty. Denmark's foreign minister emphasised the US president cannot threaten his way to ownership of the semi-autonomous Danish territory.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper reiterated the UK's position that the future of Greenland is for \"Greenlanders and for the Danes alone\" to decide.\n\nOn Monday, Trump declined to rule out the use of force and insisted he would press ahead with the threatened tariffs on goods arriving in the US from the UK and seven other Nato-allied countries.\n\nAsked by NBC News if he would use force to seize Greenland, Trump answered: \"No comment\".\n\nThe US president said he would charge Britain a 10% tariff \"on any and all goods\" sent to the US from 1 February, increasing to 25% from 1 June, until a deal is reached for Washington to purchase Greenland from Denmark.\n\nTrump said the same would apply to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland - all of whom are members of the defence alliance Nato which was founded in 1949.\n\nAsked if he will follow through on the tariff threat, Mr Trump told NBC News: \"I will, 100%.\"\n\nTrump added: \"Europe ought to focus on the war with Russia and Ukraine because, frankly, you see what that's gotten them... That's what Europe should focus on - not Greenland.\"\n\nDenmark has warned that US military action in Greenland would spell the end of Nato. In recent days, Greenland has received support from European members of the alliance - some even sent a handful of troops to Greenland last week in a move seen as symbolic.\n\nHowever, Trump followed that deployment with an announcement to impose tariffs on the eight Nato allies.\n\nDanish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said that Europe had to show President Trump tariff threats were \"not the way forward\".\n\n\"We have red lines that can't be crossed,\" he told Sky News. \"You can't threaten your way to ownership of Greenland. I have no intention of escalating this situation.\"\n\nNato secretary general Mark Rutte said the alliance will keep working with Denmark and Greenland on the security of the Arctic.\n\nThe European Union is to hold an emergency summit in Brussels for its leaders on Thursday where they will discuss how to respond to Trump's latest threat to take over Greenland.\n\nKaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said the bloc has \"no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground\".\n\n\"But trades threats are not the way to go about this,\" Kallas added. \"Sovereignty is not for trade.\"\n\n'Europe is at a total loss': Russia gloats over Greenland tensions\n\n'Europe won't be blackmailed,' Danish PM says in wake of Trump Greenland threats\n\nFaisal Islam: Trump's Greenland threats to allies are without parallel\n\nIt comes as text exchanges between Trump and the Norwegian prime minister were released - showing that on Sunday the US president blamed Norway for the fact he didn't get the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nIn his reply - seen by the BBC - Jonas Gahr Støre explained that an independent committee, not the government of Norway, awards the prize which last October went to Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado.\n\n\"Norway's position on Greenland is clear. Greenland is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Norway fully supports the Kingdom of Denmark on this matter,\" Støre added.\n\nTrump also addressed the text message exchange in Monday's interview and said: \"Norway totally controls it [the Nobel Prize] despite what they say.\n\n\"They like to say they have nothing to do with it, but they have everything to do with it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad) on Monday announced that multiple aircraft are on their way to Pituffik Space Base in Greenland.\n\nThe joint US-Canada military defence organisation stressed they are part of a routine operation \"to support various long-planned Norad activities\", and said they had been coordinated with Denmark and that the government of Greenland had been informed.\n\nSimilar Norad operations at the base took place in 2022, 2023, and last year.",

The federal investigation into his death continues.\n\nIt's the same facility where ICE said another detainee died earlier this month as staff members tried to keep him from killing himself.

If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988.\n\nDiaz was swept up on Jan. 6 in the federal crackdown on immigration in Minnesota and sent to Texas, ICE said.\n\nDiaz entered the United States in March 2024 and Border Patrol officers took him into custody, He was released on parole pending a court date and a judge ordered him to leave the U.S. in an August hearing that Diaz did not attend, ICE said.\n\nDiaz was given a final order for removal on Jan. 12, two days before he was found unconscious in his room, authorities said.\n\nICE did not release any other details on Diaz's death. The agency notifies Congress and releases a statement on its website of all in-custody deaths.\n\nDiaz, 36, was being held at Camp Montana East where ICE said another detainee, Geraldo Lunas Campos, died as staff members tried to prevent him from killing himself.\n\nBut a preliminary investigation by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office found Lunas Campos, 55, died from asphyxia from chest and neck compression and said the death would likely be classified a homicide.\n\nA fellow detainee told the AP that Lunas Campos was handcuffed and refused to go back into his cell when at least five guards pinned him to the floor. The detainee said at least one of the guards squeezed an arm around Lunas Campos' neck.\n\nICE said it is still investigating that death.",

    "fullText": "Social media is filling up with influencers telling us how to become much more intellectual. A great, enriching idea – or just another cue to show off?\n\nAh, gross from the Latin word grossus, meaning dense, bulky and unrefined. Oh God, not you too. What absolutely rubbish behaviour this is. You make me sick.\n\nBecause I happen to know things? No, because you go around rubbing it in everyone’s faces. You know what you are?\n\nAt a push, based on context, I’d wager that I’m disgustingly educated. Exactly! Everyone’s at it, you know. I’ve had enough.\n\nEnough of education? No, because it’s not school or uni that makes you disgustingly educated. You get it from – shudder – wanting to improve yourself.\n\nAn example, please. In 2024, corners of Reddit started to fill up with guides on how to become disgustingly educated. Some were lists of improving books, nonfiction essays or old films.\n\nSo far so good. But now it’s all over the place. Even TikTok is full of people telling users to read specific books if they want to boost their knowledge of Greek mythology or extinction cycles or emotional intelligence.\n\nWhat’s wrong with that? Because it’s just reading books, isn’t it? It’s something that people have managed to do for thousands of years without making a fuss, and now it’s being rebranded by TikTokers as a sign of extreme cleverness.\n\nWell, yes, but those old-timey people didn’t have phones. Oh, I see. So this is less about being an autodidact and more about making a show of improving your attention span and impulse control by going offline for meaningful periods of time?\n\nThat seems about right. And the thing that’s going to encourage that is videos of influencers telling you to read about ancient Egypt?\n\nDon’t be a snob. I’m not being a snob. I’m just worried that a trend like this going viral on something as shallow as TikTok will lead to a rise of pseudointellectualism. The achievement of actually knowing things is going to be superseded by a grim desire to simply look as if you know things for likes.\n\nThat’s definitely a danger, but in this day and age it’s a start. I guess you’re right. Maybe it isn’t such a bad thing. After all, you’re disgustingly educated enough to know the etymology of the word “gross”.\n\nActually, I looked that up on ChatGPT. Oh. I guess the age of outsourcing disgusting intelligence to robots begins now.\n\nDo say: “Nothing is cooler than being disgustingly educated.”\n\nDon’t say: “I just Photoshopped a picture of me in a bikini and a mortarboard.”",

    "fullText": "With the Trump administration recently expanding its travel ban to 39 countries and suspending visa processing for 75 in total, multiple countries have responded with travel and visa bans for Americans.\n\nThe African nations of Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali have all stopped issuing visas for Americans in what they describe as a reciprocal move, given the treatment of their citizens.\n\nAt the start of the month, Mali's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation put out a statement saying that U.S. citizens will now also be subject to \"the same conditions and requirements as those imposed by the American authorities on Malian citizens entering the United States.\"\n\nThe South Asian nation of Pakistan was included in the list of nations for which the U.S. State Department will pause processing of all immigrant visas as of Jan. 21.\n\nAlthough the move is not immediately tied to the Trump administration's actions, Pakistan is, in turn, making it more difficult for Americans to visit by suspending its \"visa prior to arrival\" program, Visas News reported. The program allowed citizens of 125 countries to apply for permission to enter easily online.\n\nFrom August 2024, citizens of countries like the United States, Canada and most European and Asian nations could apply for a 90-day tourist or business visa for free by submitting their passport information and trip details through a government portal.\n\nTravelers looking to come to the country were the first to notice that the \"Pak ID\" mobile application now directs applicants to select a traditional visa category for which they have to pay $35 USD for a single entry of up to three months (the prior visa allowed for multiple entries) and will take up to seven business days to be processed.\n\nCitizens of the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom have to pay a higher $60 fee for reasons not expanded upon. The Pakistani government has not released an official statement on the change or provided any information on whether the simplified application will ever be brought back.\n\nIn August 2024, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif classified \"this easing of the visa regime [as a way to] help make Pakistan an attractive destination for investments and tourism.\"\n\nThe country sees significantly less tourism interest than neighboring India and has over the last half-decade made several efforts to draw in international visitors.",

    "fullText": "HUDSONVILLE, Mich. (WOOD) — I-196 in the Hudsonville and Zeeland area reopened just before 6 p.m. after being closed for much of the day following a pileup of more than 100 cars, including dozens of semis, authorities say, amid heavy snow and windy conditions Monday morning.\n\nThe highway was closed for nearly eight hours between exit 62 to Hudsonville and exit 55 to Zeeland, according to the Ottawa County Sheriff’s Office. Crashes began around 10:20 a.m.\n\nArctic air, lake-effect snow to hit West Michigan\n\n“Deputies were dispatched after receiving multiple reports of numerous crashes and slide-offs in the area,” the sheriff’s office said in a release. “The incident also includes several jack-knifed semi-trucks.”\n\nAll of those injured in the crash, about nine to 12 people, had been taken to hospitals by 2 p.m., authorities said in a release. No fatalities were reported.\n\nInside woodtv.com: Live traffic conditions\n\nAuthorities used buses to take a few dozen stranded drivers to Hudsonville High School where they were able to call for rides, reconnect with family members and warm up.\n\nThe high school’s parking lot is being used as a drop-off lot for damaged vehicles while owners arrange for repairs.\n\n“Motorists are encouraged to avoid this stretch of (I-196) and avoid travel completely, unless necessary,” the sheriff’s office said.\n\nThe northbound lanes of US-131 at West Main and the US-131 Business Loop have reopened after a series of car crashes shut it down for much of the day Monday, the Kalamazoo County Sheriff’s Office reported.\n\nApproximately 15 vehicles were involved in crashes, including multiple jackknifed semi-trucks entangled in a guardrail.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Grand Rapids issued a warning to drivers, saying that “travel is not recommended” near and west of US-131 through Monday afternoon. Crashes have been reported throughout the day, closing single lanes and entire roads.\n\nWinter storm warnings and winter weather advisories are in effect through 7 a.m. Tuesday. The heaviest snow is expected to fall through Monday morning, with rates gradually lessening after that. The most persistent snow will be along and west of US-131. Winds gusting over 30 mph will create substantial blowing and drifting, leading to reduced visibility and, at times, whiteout conditions.\n\n“Numerous whiteouts are being captured on (Michigan Department of Transportation) webcams across major interstates and highways this morning,” the NWS wrote around 5:20 a.m. “Winds increase this morning and the risk for whiteouts will also be increasing.”\n\nDownload the free Storm Team 8 weather app\n\nAs temperatures hover in the teens and continue to fall, road crews have been forced to change up their strategy. Salt becomes less effective during the extreme cold, so crews are mixing in sand to provide traction.\n\n“The sand becomes the primary part of that mixture. It’s almost all sand with some liquids to cut it in,” Steve Roon, maintenance director for the Kent County Road Commission, told News 8. “We may go upwards of 1,000 pounds of sand per centerline mile, so that we’re giving that traction across that driving surface where we can.”\n\nThe Kent County Road Commission says it will keep returning to state and county primary roads Monday to make sure they’re passable. As conditions allow, crews will move into local roads.\n\nIf you’re heading out, the road commission urges you to take it slow, keep your headlights on and give plow trucks plenty of space.\n\nMost schools across West Michigan are closed Monday. Many were already closed in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, while others called a snow day. For a full list of closings, click here.\n\n— News 8’s David Horak contributed to this report.",

Keep reading \n\nIn the video, Donald and Melania were walking hand and hand when Donald noticed the reporters and dropped his wife's hand to approach the group. \"She did a great job on television the other night,\" he told the reporters, gesturing at Melania. \"And I didn't do so bad either,\" he added, \"but she did a great job on television.\" He then retreated back to his waiting wife, who was brushing rain off of her face, and took her hand again as they started back toward their destination. The cameras followed them, however, and captured Donald only holding his umbrella above his own head, leaving Melania to continue to get soaked by the rain.\n\nIn the comment section of the video, social media users were ruthless in calling out Trump for his lack of manners. \"He was probably scared his tan would wash off,\" one person suggested, and another asked, \"Is this a surprise?\"\n\n\"What a gentleman...NOT!!\" another comment reads.\n\n\"Afraid of his hair going flat and his makeup running,\" another person agreed.\n\n\"It's honestly just a lack of respect,\" pointed out another.\n\n\"As always, he thinks and cares about no one except himself!\" added the next person.\n\n\"What man lets his woman get wet in the rain?\" asked another.\n\n\"This man is no gentleman at all he hogging up the whole umbrella for himself and didn't even cover his wife!\" a final user posted.",

An emotional Kyren Wilson is cutting a dejected and disconsolate figure in the dark and grey bowels of the York Barbican.\n\nNot only has he had family health issues to contend with, but a difficult campaign has been compounded by being forced to change the cue that he used to win the world title in 2024 - after it was damaged in a \"freak accident\".\n\nThe Englishman even says he was close to having a \"mental breakdown\" during his last-32 defeat by Elliot Slessor at the UK Championship - just last month.\n\nThen fast forward just six weeks to images of Wilson pouring out of Alexandra Palace on Sunday, as he lifted the Paul Hunter Trophy and celebrated his maiden Masters triumph with his family.\n\n\"It's amazing. Father Christmas was very kind to me,\" said Wilson, who auctioned off his beloved old cue for a children's cancer charity, raising £5,250.\n\n\"It was a complete freak accident, what happened to my cue, so there are no bad feelings there but it is so important to have something you can trust out there.\"\n\nArmed with a suitable replacement, Wilson, 34, made it third time lucky when he became the 26th winner of the Masters, having twice previously been defeated in the final.\n\nHis route to glory and a second Triple Crown title took him past Si Jiahui, Neil Robertson, Wu Yize and finally four-time world champion John Higgins, who is widely regarded as one of the game's greatest players.\n\n\"I'll be honest I thought at the UK Championship I was gone, I honestly didn't know if I was ever going to be back in the winners' enclosure,\" Wilson added.\n\n\"I have such a supportive family and I promised my mum she was going to have that bit of crystal [Masters trophy] on her dining room table.\n\n\"People don't see what happens behind closed doors but I was in a bad way at the UK - really, really suffering.\n\n\"To pick up a new cue and, after one month, to go and win the second biggest major is an incredible achievement.\"",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nRobert Sanchez (Chelsea): Coming off the back of a terrible week with his errors against Arsenal in the Carabao Cup, you have to say he answered the questions the right way. Delivered against Brentford, made some big saves, kept Chelsea in the game and kept a clean sheet, which helps along the way.\n\nAlex Jimenez (Bournemouth): He came off in the 90th minute of Monday's 1-1 draw at Brighton, cramped up, but a wonderful performer. Defended excellently, and the way he went forward was fantastic as well. Unfortunately, he couldn't keep a clean sheet right at the end, but he actually wasn't on the pitch for that situation, so he gets a pass for that.\n\nHarry Maguire (Manchester United): Manchester United were excellent as they beat neighbours City on Saturday. I could've put the whole of the United team in this week, to be totally honest. However, having Harry Maguire back from his hamstring injury is huge for Michael Carrick. He was probably United's best player during Ruben Amorim's time in charge as well.\n\nJames Tarkowski (Everton): Wonderful performance in Sunday's win at Aston Villa. He gets in both for his attacking threat and also because defensively, he was a monster. I think he's one of the most underrated players in the Premier League. He's fantastic with the way he approaches the game and what he delivers.\n\nLewis Hall (Newcastle United): He was the best player on the pitch by a country mile during Newcastle's 0-0 draw at Wolves on Sunday, and he's starting to make the case that he should be starting for England. That's how good he's been this season.\n\nCrysencio Summerville (West Ham): He gets a goal - but it is more about the magnitude of the moment, and being able to get West Ham off to a flying start against Tottenham. With Saturday's 2-1 win, there is a little bit of hope now that they can get out of this mess that they find themselves in.\n\nEthan Ampadu (Leeds United): Every time Ampadu plays well, Leeds play well. Whenever they win, he is at the heart of everything. He got an assist as they beat Fulham on Saturday but the tackles and covering runs were more important. A top performance.\n\nEnzo Le Fee (Sunderland): He is excellent. He has quality and he oozes class. He gives me the same feeling as when Carlos Tevez went to West Ham - you could see he was too good for that level. He picked up some brilliant positions against Crystal Palace, and also scored a wonderful goal in Sunderland's 2-1 win.\n\nBruno Fernandes (Manchester United): He would have been a scorer in the Manchester derby if he had managed to stay onside, but he was the heart of the United performance. How many times are we going to say that? United are only as good as he drives them to be.\n\nPatrick Dorgu (Manchester United): He seems a freer player since being moved up the pitch. There have been a lot of conversations about systems at United, but with Dorgu, one thing is clear - as a high left-sided player, he seems to have added a lot to his game. More goals helps as well.\n\nBryan Mbeumo (Manchester United): Playing out of position in Saturday's derby, he ran his socks off, and delivered with a goal - a wonderful finish. He carried the team over the line. Hopefully now he can start to find the net more consistently for Manchester United.\n\nMichael Carrick (Manchester United): A tough week for him. A lot of people, including Roy Keane and myself, were questioning whether he's good enough and things of that nature - or whether he even deserves the role. He answered emphatically. A wonderful, wonderful result. I think you have to say that's easily the manager's performance of the week. Now, can he back it up against Arsenal next week?\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

    "fullText": "It was a moment Charalampos Kostoulas will never forget.\n\nAn acrobatic overhead-kick equaliser in stoppage time - not a bad way for Brighton's 18-year-old Greek forward to open his account at the Amex Stadium.\n\nThe substitute, who signed from Olympiakos for £29.78m in the summer, struck just when all looked lost for the Seagulls after they trailed Bournemouth to a hotly-disputed first-half penalty.\n\nBrighton boss Fabian Hurzeler was full of praise for his teenage saviour but it still did not ease his anger over the award of the spot-kick that led to Marcus Tavernier's equaliser - as goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen was adjudged to have fouled Amine Adli after video assistant referee (VAR) review.\n\nHe said: \"It was a nice goal. We all know what he is capable of. But, we all prefer to win.\"\n\nAsked if he thought it was a penalty, the German said: \"No. It is difficult to speak to referees. They have their own opinion and it is very difficult to have a conversation with them. We have to accept it even though we don't agree.\n\n\"A touch and a contact is not enough, and that is what the referees said to us before the start of the season. And in certain moments they don't do it, that's just the truth.\n\n\"Contact doesn't mean foul and in this situation it's contact, maybe a little bit, but it's not a foul. It doesn't make sense.\"\n\nGreece Under-21 international Kostoulas made his professional debut in 2024, having come through Olympiakos' academy - netting seven goals in 22 first-team league appearances last season.\n\nShould an add-on of £1.7m for him be paid during his time at Brighton, it would make the transfer a record deal for a Greek player.\n\nSince arriving at Brighton, he has made 17 appearances and scored two goals, with captain Lewis Dunk describing him as a \"special talent\".\n\nDunk said: \"I've seen him score better in training, but that was unbelievable.\n\n\"I think you've seen glimpses, and there'll be many more things to come from him. He's adapting to the country, new league, and he's shown what he can do. That shows exactly what he can do.\"",

    "title": "Man Utd's complicated relationship with Class of 92",
    "description": "Manchester United and the class of 92 have a complicated relationship. But is it a problem?",
    "fullText": "In the tit-for-tat exchange between Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez and two of the club's most famous recent players, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes have had their say.\n\nOn the same 'The Good, The Bad, The Football' podcast where they upset Martinez with their mickey-taking before the Manchester derby, the pair praised the Argentina defender for his performance in the 2-0 win against Manchester City at Old Trafford but questioned his rationale for responding to what they said.\n\n\"Fair play to him,\" said Butt. \"He has gone man-to-man with the best centre forward in the world. So, we come on here and say, 'well done'. Brilliant. He has done really well.\n\n\"I just think when someone gets so upset about something on a podcast, or in the media, to come out and say, 'they can say what they want' and 'come to my house' - grow up.\n\n\"If you are going to get so emotional about someone saying something about you and react like that, you shouldn't be at a big football club.\"\n\nBefore the game, Butt and Scholes had joked with host Paddy McGuiness that Haaland would pick 5ft 7in Martinez up at Old Trafford and run with him.\n\nIn the aftermath of the victory, Martinez said: \"Everyone can talk on the television, but when you see [them] here face to face, no-one says anything.\"\n\nThe argument is a snapshot of a complicated relationship United have with their famed 'Class of 92'.\n\nBetween them, Ryan Giggs, Scholes, David Beckham, Butt and the Neville brothers, Gary and Phil, made 3,448 appearances for the club. They were the foundation for the second great team Sir Alex Ferguson built that became the first in England to win the Treble in 1999.\n\nGiggs became interim manager for four games following the dismissal of David Moyes in 2014. He had previously been a coach and then became assistant manager to Louis Van Gaal. Butt, Scholes and Phil Neville all coached under Giggs.\n\nButt worked as a youth coach before that and was appointed United's head of academy in 2016 before leaving in 2021. There are few more qualified to talk about United's DNA of bringing young players through.\n\nIt is a part of the club he cares passionately about. On 15 December, he turned out with United officials on a rainy night in Moss Side to coach a group of underprivileged children on behalf of Sir Bobby Charlton's Foundation even though his old club were playing Bournemouth in the Premier League a couple of hours later.\n\nButt previously objected strongly to an observation from a United official that youth development is about more than simply winning. More recently, he claimed the club was threatening to cancel his season tickets.\n\nThree days before Butt's Foundation appearance, Gary Neville had been at Old Trafford as United announced they had agreed to become a campus for the UA92 University, which was founded by the Class of 92 in 2019.\n\nIt is clear the bond still exists but their opinions on United are eagerly sought, especially the negative ones.\n\nIn October, Giggs sat inside Old Trafford as a speaker at the Training Ground Guru conference and lamented Ruben Amorim's preference for playing wider players on the opposite side of the pitch to their strongest foot.\n\nAll are regular speakers on matchdays at Hotel Football, the hotel they part-own and is located barely 50 yards from Old Trafford.\n\nIn the past, the hotel itself was the subject of tension. United tried to stop its construction, although the club do use it themselves on occasion now.\n\nThen there is Neville, who either as a commentator or pundit on Sky's football coverage - or the hugely successful 'Stick to Football' podcast - is rarely short of an opinion.\n\nIn the news conference at Elland Road that triggered his dismissal, former United head coach Ruben Amorim cited Neville as someone senior figures within the club paid too much attention to.\n\nThat is a debatable point. Yet, unlike former skipper Roy Keane, whose criticisms of new boss Michael Carrick had been pointed and personal, Neville was trusted by United to talk to his former team-mate on camera in the Old Trafford tunnel before the derby.\n\nLaunching his UA92 Old Trafford campus venture, Neville offered this to BBC Sport on the theory the Class of 92 and United do not get on.\n\n\"That's a theory,\" he said. \"There's no doubt a few years ago there were maybe some causes for concern but that's been smoothed over.\n\n\"I don't think there's any issues whatsoever now,\" adding that Class of 92 are \"desperate for the club to succeed\" and \"disappointed and frustrated\" when they lose.\n\nUnited's chief operating officer Collette Roche was of a similar view.\n\n\"A lot of our ex-players are in media and obviously are going to have opinions around the football team,\" she said. \"That's fine.\n\n\"But the class of 92 are part of our family and therefore the relationship we've got with UA92 goes far deeper than the latest headline or podcast.\"\n\nWhich is fine if, as Scholes and Butt suggest, the players ignore it.\n\nThe problem is, as Martinez showed, they don't.\n\n\"We exchanged messages on Instagram quite some time ago because he wasn't happy with something I said,\" Scholes said.\n\n\"I can't remember what it was, but he said he had lost all respect for me.\n\n\"I sent him my phone number, but I have never heard anything from him.\"",

    "fullText": "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche makes clear that the Department of Justice won’t look into the death of Renee Good—but that won’t stop Minnesota from investigating.\n\nIt’s hard to be shocked by anything the Trump administration does. But when Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News Sunday that the Department of Justice will not investigate the actions of Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who killed Renee Good on January 7, I’ll admit to a moment of shock.\n\n“What happened that day has been reviewed by millions of Americans, because it was recorded when it happened,” Blanche told anchor Shannon Bream. “We don’t just go out and investigate every time an officer is forced to defend himself against somebody or putting his life in danger, we never do…\n\n“We investigate when it’s appropriate to investigate. That is not the case here…. We are not going to bow to pressure from the media, from politicians. So no, we are not investigating.”\n\nBREAM: Is the FBI conducting an investigation into the ICE agent who shot Renee Good?\n\nBLANCHE: What happened that day has been reviewed by millions of Americans because it was recorded. We investigate when it's appropriate to investigate. That is not the case here. We are not… pic.twitter.com/FIQVVavJhq\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, however, was not surprised. “No, I wasn’t shocked, because this is what we’ve been hearing on the ground for days,” he told me Monday morning. “I was glad to hear him say it, because we can bring it to a court.”\n\nEllison and Hennepin County District Attorney Mary Moriarty have promised to investigate Good’s killing, but the Justice Department has refused to share the evidence it has collected. “But if they’re not investigating? How do they justify not giving us shell casings, the cars [Good’s and Ross’s], the photos?”\n\nBlanche did get one fact right on Sunday: “Millions of Americans” have indeed seen the footage of Ross shooting Good at close range—and most of them think the ICE agent was in the wrong. An astonishing 82 percent of people polled by Quinnipiac said they’d seen video of the incident, and a majority said Ross was at fault; his life was never “in danger.” Several painstaking New York Times analyses examined the many cell-phone videos of the incident—including Ross’s own—and concluded there is no evidence Good’s vehicle ever struck the agent. He shot her at least twice—one shot directly into her left ear—after she had clearly turned the SUV away from him. There’s at least a foot of daylight between the vehicle and the ICE agent as he fires his last shots.\n\n“I think it’s the purest sign that we’ve abandoned procedural justice and are full-on in an outcomes-driven system,” Ellison said. “Blue lives matter, until they’re upholding the democratic transfer of power [on January 6]. This is a clear hallmark of fascism.”\n\nBlanche said this the same weekend that we learned that Good was still alive when paramedics reached her—not breathing, and with an erratic pulse, but a pulse nonetheless. At least 15 minutes earlier, moments after the shooting, a neighborhood doctor approached ICE agents and asked if he could check her pulse, and he was turned away. “I’m a physician!” he told them. “I don’t care,” the agent replied. I’d like to know that agent’s name and position. His actions merit investigation, too.\n\nNot only is the DOJ refusing to investigate Ross, but Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem instructed CBS’s Margaret Brennan not to even say his name on the air. “Don’t say his name! I mean, for heaven’s sake, we shouldn’t have people continue to dox law enforcement.”\n\n“His name is public,” Brennan replied. “I know, but that doesn’t mean it should continue to be said,” our puppy-killing cabinet secretary insisted.\n\nEric Blanc, Wes McEnany, and Claire Sandberg\n\nColumn\n\n /\n\n Kate Wagner\n\n“Minnesota insurrection is a direct result of a FAILED governor and a TERRIBLE mayor encouraging violence against law enforcement. It’s disgusting,” he wrote on X on Wednesday. “Walz and Frey – I’m focused on stopping YOU from your terrorism by whatever means necessary. This is not a threat. It’s a promise.”\n\nOn Sunday, Blanche told Bream, “You saw the Governor and the Mayor actively encouraging criminals to go out on the street and impede ICE. That is not allowed under our law… That’s what we’re looking at.”\n\nLast week, at least 10 Justice Department attorneys resigned because of the department’s failure to investigate Ross and the pressure to investigate Becca Good. Six came from the local US Attorney’s office, which also objected to shutting out local law enforcement and prosecutors from probing the shooting.\n\nNevertheless, Ellison says his office and Moriarty’s are already investigating the shooting, interviewing witnesses, and collecting evidence through an online portal. While some analyses hold that it’s tough for state officials to prosecute a federal agent, Ellison insists otherwise. “No, it isn’t,” he told me. “No, it isn’t. All cases prosecuting law enforcement are difficult,” he acknowledged, but “to say the states have to abandon their power to maintain order in their state? We have the legal right to prosecute and the legal right to investigate.”\n\nThough Ellison said he wasn’t “shocked” by Blanche’s brazen assertion that the Justice Department isn’t investigating Ross, he did admit it was proof that “we are in another kind of moment.” Before Trump, he said, the Justice Department “would have at least done some kind of investigation, assembled a grand jury,” while in the end likely clearing the agent. The notion that the administration no longer has to even pretend to follow the law—Trump last week said only his own “morality” constrains him—puts is in “dangerous” territory, he said.\n\n“The big danger is thinking there’s going to be some ‘snapback’ moment,” he added. “There will not be one that we don’t ourselves create.”",
