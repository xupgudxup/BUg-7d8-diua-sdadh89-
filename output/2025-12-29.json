    "fullText": "Stop me if you’ve heard this before…\n\nTwo blue-blood college football programs with a rich history of national championships are set to square off, but the past few years have been much kinder to one team than the other.\n\nOne team is the defending national champion, the previous year having ended its relatively brief national title drought by thoroughly dominating a fellow, one-loss blue blood program in the championship game. This program last won a national title a decade prior, so the gap between titles had become uncomfortably long for this program’s fanbase. Of course, the previous year’s title game wasn’t nearly as close as the final score suggests. The now-defending champs raced out to a multi-touchdown lead by halftime, and lead 20+ points in the third quarter.\n\nAlthough the defending champs lost quite a bit of a talent to the NFL, including multiple first round draft picks in the previous year’s draft, this team is still stacked with future-NFL talent up and the down the roster. This team’s star safety and stable of future-pro wide receivers are particularly problematic for their opponents. The quarterback is also a Heisman finalist. Nearly every pundit in the nation believes this is the most talented team in the country, and nobody is expecting this team to lose.\n\nOn the other side of the field is the underdog. A talented team in its own right that is coming out of a long rebuild – the previous three years saw this team go a combined 21-15. But signs of progress are there. At the helm is a former offensive assistant who returned to helm this program 16 years later after building his head coaching experience. This team’s relatively new coach is a particularly strong recruiter, and this program is coming off multiple Top 10 ranked recruiting classes. Signs of emergence really started to show once this program was able to consistently beat its rivals, even though those wins did not necessarily translate to conference or national titles.\n\nThis season, the underdog built its reputation on defense. No team managed to score in the 30’s, including its premier non-conference opponent – a top 10 team that itself had national title aspirations, but finished its season with two losses and on the outside looking in. In fact, the offense looked so anemic at times that this team won a road game despite scoring just 10 points. So defense is definitely this team’s calling card, but the offense’s best weapon is a freshman stud who was the conference’s freshman of the year.\n\nThe “underdog” is both 2025 Miami and 2002 Ohio State:\n\nOhio State was a combined 21-15 from 1999 to 2001. Miami was a nearly identical 22-16 from 2022-2024.\n\nDespite the mediocre record, Ohio State was coming off back-to-back wins over arch-rival Michigan in 2001 and 2002. Despite the mediocre record, Miami was coming off back-to-back wins over arch-rival Florida State in 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe premiere non-conference win for 2002 Ohio State was 25-7 at home against Washington St., which finished the regular season with two losses and ranked No. 10 in the AP Poll. The premiere non-conference win for 2025 Miami was 27-24 at home against Notre Dame, which finished the regular season with two losses and ranked No. 9 in the AP Poll.\n\nHead Coach Jim Tressell was an assistant offensive coach for Ohio State from 1983 to 1985 before returning to Ohio State 16 years later in 2001. Head Coach Mario Cristobal was an assistant offensive coach for Miami from 2004 to 2006 before returning to Miami 16 years later in 2022.\n\nAccording to 247Sports, the Buckeyes had top ten recruiting classes in 2000 and 2001 (No. 6 and 9). The Hurricanes had top ten recruiting classes in 2023 and 2024 (No. 7 and 4).\n\nThe 2002 Ohio State Buckeyes typically held teams to under 20 points, never allowing a team to score 30, which was necessary considering how anemic their offense was at times. The 2025 Miami Hurricanes typically held teams under 20 points, never allowing a team to score 30, which was necessary considering how anemic their offense was at times.\n\n2002 Ohio State’s best offensive weapon was true freshman RB Maurice Clarett, that season’s Big Ten Freshman of the Year. 2025 Miami’s best offensive weapon is true freshman WR Malachi Toney, this season’s ACC Freshman of the Year.\n\nThe “defending champion” is both 2002 Miami and 2025 Ohio State:\n\nOhio State won the 2024 national title, beating blue-blood Notre Dame in a game that was 31-7 in the 3rd Quarter. Miami won the 2001 national title, beating blue-blood Nebraska in a game that was 34-0 at halftime.\n\nOhio State last won a national title a decade prior in 2014. Miami last won a national title a decade prior in 1991.\n\nFollowing their 2024 title run, in the 2025 NFL Draft the Buckeyes had 4 first round selections (WR Emeka Egbuka, G Donovan Jackson, DT Tyliek Williams, and DT Josh Simmons) plus another 3 second round selections (RB Quinshon Judkins, RB TreVeyon Henderson, and DE JT Tuimoloau). In the 2002 NFL Draft, the Hurricanes had 5 first round selections (OT Bryan McKinnie, TE Jeremy Shockey, CB Philip Buchanon, FS Ed Reed, and CB Mike Rumph) plus another second round selection (RB Clinton Portis).\n\nThe 2025 Ohio State Buckeyes are led by Heisman Finalist, QB Julian Sayin. The 2002 Miami Hurricanes were led by Heisman Finalist, QB Ken Dorsey.\n\nArguably 2025 Ohio State’s best offensive weapons were receivers for their Heisman Finalist quarterback, namely WRs Jeremiah Smith, Carnell Tate, and Brandon Inniss. Arguably 2002 Miami’s best offensive weapons were receivers for their Heisman Finalist quarterback, namely WRs Andre Johnson and Roscoe Parrish plus TE Kellen Winslow, Jr.\n\nArguably 2025 Ohio State’s defensive leaders are S Caleb Downs and LB Arvell Reese. Arguably 2002 Miami’s defensive leaders were S Sean Taylor and LB Jonathan Vilma.\n\nIt’s like looking into a mirror a quarter-of-a-century apart. For ‘Canes fans, hopefully history repeats itself.",

    "title": "What has been the most encouraging part of the 2025 Lions season?",
    "description": "2025 was a failure for the Detroit Lions, but there were still some encouraging parts.",
    "fullText": "In a season unanimously viewed as a failure, there are many parts of the 2025 Detroit Lions that can be considered disappointing. Whether it is the continued onslaught of injuries, the regression from the offense, the struggles of the defense, or the inability to reach the playoffs—let alone compete for a Super Bowl—a lot went wrong for Detroit. Yet with one game left to play before the book closes on the season, can we acknowledge some positive moments?\n\nMany will fall into the “nothing can be viewed positively since they missed the playoffs” camp. While it is understandable to judge a season in a black and white way, either success or failure, the truth of the matter is that the Lions are not staring down the barrel of a total rebuild—they can expect tough questions with tough answers, sure, but not a total rebuild. The core of the team is still intact, and it’s not hard to envision a rebound next season.\n\nToday’s Question of the Day is:\n\nMy answer: Jack Campbell’s breakout.\n\nThere are a lot of honorable mentions for this discussion. Jahmyr Gibbs showcased an elite skill set—when the blocking held up. Jameson Williams had some duds, but he nonetheless put together another 1,000-yard season, all while growing as a route runner. Al-Quadin Muhammad proved that his late 2024 tear was not a fluke with over 10 sacks in 2025, albeit in limited snaps—perhaps too limited. Thomas Harper proved to be an excellent waiver wire claim, not only starting multiple games but playing fairly well when called upon.\n\nHowever, they all pale in comparison to Campbell’s ascension. His 2023 rookie campaign was rough: the flashes of athleticism were there, but the mental game lagged far behind. In 2024, he started to put it together, looking far more comfortable as a central figure on defense. This season, Campbell has elevated his game to a Pro Bowl level and, with enough support, arguably an All-Pro level too.\n\nHe has taken significant strides in run defense and is now perhaps the best run stopping linebacker in the league (per PFF, he is first in run defense grade among linebackers). Equally impressive has been his pass rushing prowess. He is no Micah Parsons, but his blitzing ability has vastly improved over previous seasons. In the past, his blitzes were carried by his athleticism. The athleticism was still present in 2025, but he complemented it with a knack for finding the right lane to exploit. He presently has five sacks on the season, third on the team behind Aidan Hutchinson (13.5) and Muhammad (11.0). While this might say a lot about the Lions’ pass rush, that should not discount the role Campbell has played.\n\nCampbell is second in the NFL in tackles, and he has earned every single one of them. For as bad as the Lions were in 2025, Campbell was a bright spot nearly every week.",

    "title": "What was behind Enea Bastianini's worst season in MotoGP?",
    "description": "Switching from Ducati to KTM was “close to a shock” for the seven-time grand prix winner Bastianini",
    "fullText": "Enea Bastianini has offered insight into why he struggled to such an extent during a wretched first season on KTM’s MotoGP bike in 2025.\n\nBastianini moved to Tech3 this year on a factory-spec bike, partnering Maverick Vinales in an all-new line-up at KTM’s secondary squad.\n\nBut from his first test with the Austrian marque in Valencia 2024, it was clear that the RC16 was not playing to his strength - and a crash in which he completely wrecked his bike only reinforced that impression.\n\nProblems persisted when the season kicked off in March, leaving Bastianini in the shadows of his new team-mate Vinales, who impressed with his adaptation to the RC16. Across the opening 10 rounds and before Vinales broke his shoulder at the Sachsenring, Bastianini managed just 42 points compared to 69 for the former.\n\nThere was a ray of hope that the Italian had turned around his campaign when he qualified fourth in Hungary and followed that up with a podium in Barcelona, but it ultimately amounted to little more than a brief respite.\n\nHe eventually ended the season a distant 14th in the standings, scoring just over a third of the points Pedro Acosta accumulated on the factory KTM (112 points vs 307).\n\nIt was a far cry from the heights Bastianini reached just last season, when he guided his works Ducati GP24 to two victories and seven other grand prix podiums.\n\nIn fact, this was easily the worst season of his MotoGP career; even in his rookie season in 2021, he managed to finish 11th in the championship and score 102 points from 18 rounds at a time when there were no sprint races.\n\nBastianini makes no secret in explaining how steep his learning curve proved after switching manufacturers for the first time in MotoGP.\n\n“I think the adaptation to the bike this year has been very complicated for me, starting from the first test when I jumped,” he said. “It's not been a shock, but very close to a shock because the bike was very different from the other one.\n\n“When it's like this, you have every weekend to work, to change something. Also [despite] this, we were competitive on Sundays.\n\n“Last year, at the end of the season, I was fast in the sprints and I was always on top. I knew how it would be and what the approach of the weekend was, but you have to be clear. This year, the situation was not clear to me.”\n\nFor much of 2025, Bastianini found himself on the back foot early in the weekend, struggling with his feeling on the bike on Fridays. While there was often clear progress overnight and into Sunday, he was frequently left with too much ground to make up.\n\nAt Valencia, for instance, the 27-year-old toiled near the back in practice and qualified only 20th. Yet his race pace was strong, allowing him to climb steadily through the field to finish a solid 10th.\n\n“Friday complicated, Saturday a bit less and Sunday in the race we are competitive. This happened many times. I think [it happened] every weekend, from just two or three weekends apart,” he highlighted the trend.\n\nBastianini’s improved pace in race trim was partly down to his increased confidence on medium tyres, which are preferred during longer grands prix. With Michelin’s soft rubber, he suffered from a phenomenon called the ‘rear pushing the front’, which had a detrimental impact on his cornering ability.\n\n“We are also competitive in the race because I find the confidence to be fast with the medium tyre,” he explained. “When we put a soft on the rear, the bike gives me the opposite; no confidence and I can't push.\n\n“[With the soft tyre], the rear pushes me out in every corner and it's also much more complicated to turn. With the medium, it's much better for me to slide with the rear, I'm much more confident. Lap by lap in the race, I'm much more confident. This has happened every time.”\n\nBastianini was pinning his hopes on the post-season Valencia test to find a breakthrough and head to the winter break on a positive note, but after trying a variety of components in a condensed schedule, he left Spain without the answers he had been seeking.\n\n\"I still haven't cleared up all my doubts about certain things,” he conceded. “We also tested two quite different bikes. The new bike had a different chassis and a few other slightly different things. But I still haven't really understood the pros and cons of both. The only thing I've understood is that the seat is much more ergonomic, anyway.\n\n“But hey, I'm happier to have wrapped up 2025.”\n\nBastianini knows that the first pre-season test of 2025 will be important for him as he heads into the second and final year of his KTM contract.\n\n\"More than confidence, I'm leaving knowing what awaits me next year. I finished 17th [in the test], and quite far back. So I wanted to finish a bit higher up the standings, to end on a high note. But we couldn't work on the set-up.\n\n“Therefore, Sepang will be a crucial test for me: I'll have to work very hard and try to make the most of the three days we have.”\n\nKTM’s 850cc engine for 2027 MotoGP season breaks cover in Jerez test\n\nWhy KTM would be wise to prepare for a future without Pedro Acosta\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

They lost Kai Havertz from the opening day, while captain Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli, Noni Madueke and Max Dowman have had spells on the sidelines.\n\nNow, after injuries mainly affecting attacking players, it is the Arsenal backline which is suffering.\n\nArteta was forced to play Declan Rice in an unfamiliar right-back position against Brighton on Saturday because Jurrien Timber was injured and Riccardo Calafiori picked up an issue in the warm-up.\n\nGabriel returned from injury in the 2-1 win, but the return dates of Cristhian Mosquera, Timber and Calafiori are not known.\n\n\"We're going to be really aware of the situation and the timescale of certain players,\" Arteta said.\n\n\"We have to be actively looking, and then can we do it or not?\n\n\"That's a different story, but our job is to be always very prepared because something can happen.\"\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Arne Slot could dip into the transfer market after losing Alexander Isak to injury for the foreseeable future",
    "fullText": "Liverpool could become major players in the January transfer market after Alexander Isak’s serious injury ruled him out for several months.\n\nArne Slot can at least lean on Hugo Ekitike, with the French forward settling quickly to life in the Premier League.\n\n“It’s going to be a long injury, for a couple of months,” Slot said of Isak, who joined the Reds from Newcastle for £125m in the summer and has scored just three goals in 16 appearances in all competitions. “It’s a big disappointment for him and, as a result, for us.”\n\nBut reinforcements could come to boost the Reds after a testing first half of the season.\n\nHere are the latest stories surrounding the transfer market at Anfield:\n\nAntoine Semenyo has been one of the players of the season for Bournemouth and is the main name strongly attached to the Reds so far ahead of next month’s window opening. The 25-year-old is also versatile, with an ability to play across the front line, and has scored eight goals and assisted three \n\nBut while the Reds have registered an interest in Semenyo, Manchester City have moved ahead of Liverpool in the race to sign the Ghanaian international, with The Independent understanding City have opened talks with Bournemouth in a bid to sign the player.\n\nSemenyo has a £65m release clause in his contract with the Cherries and while a move is not yet wrapped up, Liverpool face a decision whether to trigger the release clause themselves and match City’s interest. Semenyo would like to decide upon his next club before 1 January, while his release clause is thought to expire on 10 January.\n\nFabrizio Romano says that Liverpool are “open” to strengthening the squad next month, though that is unlikely to involve Marc Guehi, having had a bid accepted before the move collapsed late in the window last summer.\n\nThe Crystal Palace star is likely to wait until next summer for a move on a free transfer, though Liverpool will still be in the race with Bayern Munich are also strongly linked.\n\nMohamed Salah’s future will also need to be settled, though the Egypt star will complete his time at the Afcon 2025 with the Pharaohs before returning to Anfield next month. Ibrahima Konate and Andy Robertson will similarly go into amid uncertainty, with both entering the final six months of their current contracts. Liverpool remain committed to extending Konate’s deal but will not budge from their existing wage structure, according to Sky Sports.\n\nBrentford forward Igor Thiago, after his blazing start to the season with the Bees with 11 goals in 17 Premier League games, and PSG’s Bradley Barcola are names that have floated around recent gossip columns, though neither move has accelerated or gathered pace just yet.\n\nIsak’s injury has also prompted reports of interest in various strikers, with PSG’s Goncalo Ramos, Juventus’ Dusan Vlahovic and England international Ivan Toney named as potential short-term solutions, but nothing concrete has been established.\n\nMeanwhile Harvey Elliott, currently struggling for game time on loan at Aston Villa, is unlikely to return to Anfield after Slot’s concise summary of the Reds’s stance.\n\n“No, Harvey is an Aston Villa player and he is supposed to be going there for a season. So, questions about him, the best thing to ask is Aston Villa - they are doing really well, by the way.”",

That would be something we thought would be pretty cool. In this league, it’s hard to win on the road, and we accomplished that today.”\n\nIn victory, Maye joined Tom Brady (11 times) and Drew Bledsoe (twice) as the only New England quarterbacks to reach 4,000 yards passing in a season.\n\n“They don’t give me a vote,” Head coach Mike Vrabel said of the league MVP buzz around Maye. “But there is nobody else we want as our quarterback.”\n\nHATS & T-SHIRTS pic.twitter.com/bBUdcH1ya5\n\n— z - New England Patriots (@Patriots) December 29, 2025\n\nVrabel praised the team’s effort but emphasized the need for continued improvement.\n\n“We’re really focused on trying to improve late in the year,” Vrabel said. “I’m just happy that everyone was able to play.

New England needs a Week 18 win and a Denver Broncos loss to get the No. 1 seed and a first-round bye in the NFL playoffs.\n\nBoth Denver and New England are 13-3, but because of their better record versus shared opponents—most notably the Las Vegas Raiders, who defeated the Patriots early in the season—the Broncos control their own fate and have a tiebreaker over the Patriots.\n\nDownload the FREE Boston 25 News app for breaking news alerts.\n\nFollow Boston 25 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch Boston 25 News NOW",

    "fullText": "Arsenal host Aston Villa on Tuesday, which also happens to be Ollie Watkins’ 30th birthday.\n\nWatkins hasn’t been in great form this season, but things have been picking up lately, particularly with the striker scoring twice in a win away to Chelsea on Saturday night.\n\nThe next game has particular significance to the player, not just because it’s against Premier League leaders Arsenal, but because Watkins’ family will be there supporting the Gunners.\n\nFar from hoping his family enjoy the game, Watkins has instead told the media he wants to send them home disappointed.\n\n“I’ve got a lot of family coming to it that support them (Arsenal),” Watkins admitted.\n\n“So they can be at the other end and hopefully watch me have the same outcome as [against Chelsea] in a couple of days.”\n\nAs mentioned, Watkins hasn’t been at his best so far in 2025/26, scoring just five goals and assisting one in 25 appearances for Villa. Yet it’s fair to say things have improve in December, with five of those six goal contributions coming in his five league games so far this month.\n\nThat includes a brace in an away win over Brighton, an assist in a home win over Manchester United, and another brace in an away win over Chelsea.\n\nWatkins was also constantly threatening against Arsenal in Villa’s 2-1 victory in early December, despite neither scoring nor assisting and wasting a big chance when in on goal against David Raya. He’ll hope to make his chances count this time around.",

    "title": "Usyk vs Wilder edges nearer as date and location details emerge",
    "description": "Oleksandr Usyk has been granted a voluntary title defence, which the unified heavyweight champion may use to face Deontay Wilder",
    "fullText": "Oleksandr Usyk’s manager has confirmed that a fight with Deontay Wilder is “very likely”, while sharing details on when and where the bout could take place.\n\nUsyk, the unified heavyweight champion, has been linked to a surprise fight with Wilder despite their contrasting form – with the unbeaten Ukrainian twice becoming undisputed champion in the last two years, while the American is 2-4 dating back to 2020.\n\nUsyk last fought in July, stopping Daniel Dubois to regain undisputed status at heavyweight, and he was then ordered to face WBO interim champion Joseph Parker. However, Usyk took time out to address an injury, and in the meantime, Parker was stopped by Fabio Wardley.\n\nThat seemingly set up Wardley for a shot at Usyk, but the latter vacated the official WBO belt and has been granted a voluntary title defence. It appears he will use that option to face Wilder – one of the more-dominant heavyweights of this generation, but now a faded force, it seems.\n\n“It’s very likely,” Klimas told The National on Monday, “because right now we’re working on it, and we’re working on some multi-fight agreement for Oleksandr.\n\n“As soon as we’re going to confirm that, we’re going to jump in. And some talks already are going on with the team of Wilder. We’re looking at Las Vegas or Los Angeles, and dates are the end of April, beginning of May.\n\n“Wilder is one of the best names Oleksandr didn’t face yet. He’s still in good shape, and he’s still a fighter, so he’s interesting. And as well, it’s the United States.”\n\nWilder last fought in June, stopping Tyrrell Anthony Herndon in seven rounds to bounce back from two straight losses, having been knocked out by Zhilei Zhang in 2024 and outpointed by Parker in 2023.\n\nPreviously, the 40-year-old held the WBC title from 2015 to 2020, ultimately losing it in the first of two consecutive KO defeats by Tyson Fury.\n\nFury held that belt until 2024, when Usyk outpointed the Briton to become undisputed heavyweight king for the first time. Usyk gave up the IBF title before outpointing Fury again, but he regained the belt from Dubois this July – with his second KO of “Dynamite”.\n\nKlimas continued, “I cannot say that [Usyk] is not going to be fighting in the Riyadh Season,” referencing potential Saudi Arabian involvement in his next fight. “He might be fighting in the Riyadh Season, but as far as right now, we don’t have any offers or anything like that from them.\n\n“No, actually [it] is a different group from the United States. It’s not official yet, so I cannot tell you.”\n\nKlimas also addressed Usyk’s future, with the former undisputed cruiserweight champion seemingly in the twilight of his career at the age of 38.\n\n“He has at least two more years, as he says,” Klimas said. “I cannot go inside of his body, but he feels strong. It’s not time for him to hang up his gloves, and he’s ready to go.”",

    "title": "Slopes Are Empty as a Labor Dispute Shuts Down Telluride Colo",
    "description": "Now, vacationers looking to ski are wondering what to do and merchants are hoping it doesn’t last.",
    "fullText": "The ski runs above the mountain town of Telluride, Colo., sat eerily empty on Saturday. Chair lifts hung as motionless as icicles. Tourists slumped beside outdoor fire pits, trying not to think about the money they had spent on ski vacations now upended by a labor dispute.\n\n“This is the first time I’ve seen snow in six years,” Alexander Caro, 23, who flew in from Miami with his family, said as he looked hungrily at the base of the ski mountain, now blocked off by “closed” signs.\n\nA few feet away, a golden Labrador retriever played fetch in the snow beside the resort’s shuttered main lift. It was the closest anyone would get to having fun on the mountain this holiday weekend, after the resort decided to shut down its operations in response to a vote by the ski patrollers’ union to reject a contract offer and go on strike for higher pay.\n\nThe resort and its owner, Chuck Horning, a real-estate investor based in California, blamed the patrollers for the shutdown. In an open letter, Mr. Horning accused the patrol union of rejecting what he called “industry-leading, livable and sustainable” pay increases that would have raised the starting pay for patrollers to about $24 an hour.\n\nGraham Hoffman, the president of the 78-member Telluride Professional Ski Patrol Association, said the union had already come down from its initial demand of an increase of $8 per hour.\n\nThe current average pay for a ski patroller is $29 an hour, according to the union. The ski patrol provides medical assistance to skiers and guidance on the mountain, and helps to reduce the likelihood of avalanches. Patrollers say it is demanding and sometimes dangerous work, its perils highlighted by a recent avalanche at Mammoth Mountain that caught two patrollers.\n\nMr. Hoffman said the resort deserved the blame for the economic damage that might come from stopping the lifts.\n\n“We didn’t shut the mountain down,” he told several dozen ski patrollers in red jackets on Saturday morning, as they prepared to picket beside the gondola that connects the old mining town of Telluride to the slopes and the neighboring chalet-style town of Mountain Village.\n\nThe towns are scrambling to give visitors something to do by lighting fire pits and setting up ice-sculpting events and children’s play areas, or urging them to go hiking or snowmobiling. Local officials say there has not yet been a flood of cancellations. But they worry that few visitors will be willing to spend $10,000 on a winter trip to Telluride if the mountain stays closed.\n\n“They came out to ski,” Mayor Teddy Errico of Telluride said.\n\nThe clash between the ski patrol union and its wealthy out-of-town owner has intensified the debate over the chasm between the superrich and everyone else in gilded resort towns like Telluride, where the median home price has soared to nearly $4 million since the pandemic. Many workers have been priced out of Telluride and, unable to find subsidized housing, have little choice but to commute an hour along treacherous mountain roads.\n\nTom Sokolowski, who at 80 years old is one of Telluride’s oldest and longest-serving ski patrollers, said he got his start on the mountain in the early 1970s, long before the Four Seasons began selling $7 million “private residences” or restaurants served $150 Tomahawk steak dinners. Back then, Telluride was still a dwindling old mining town in the remote San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado.\n\nHe said he never paid more than $150 in rent — a far cry from the $1,500 a month that some newcomers now pay to rent a room.\n\nBut Mr. Sokolowski said it was never easy to cobble together a living in a tourism-dependent town like Telluride, even before the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Tom Cruise began snapping up real estate. Because the ski season runs from late November through April, most patrollers are considered seasonal workers who do not receive health insurance. Many spend the off-season working construction and maintenance jobs, or as mountain guides or in restaurants.\n\n“The ski bum life is almost done,” Mr. Sokolowski said. “That’s why we’re doing this.”\n\nTensions between workers and industry have roiled Telluride ever since its early mining days. In the early 1900s, gold and silver miners struck for minimum wages and better working conditions. But when the mining company brought in replacement workers, the strike spiraled into what newspapers called “a bloody riot.”\n\nThis time, many who live in overwhelmingly liberal Telluride — population 2,500, where utility boxes are plastered with “Eliminate Billionaires” stickers — say they support the ski patrol. As the patrollers marched down the main street on Saturday, snowy peaks towering above them, bus drivers and chauffeurs for luxury rental services honked in support.\n\nMr. Horning makes for an easy villain around Telluride. Local officials call him an absentee owner who has erratically cycled through ski-area managers, including, local officials said, firing his own son, and picked fights over funding the free gondola service and a summer-concert series. Local leaders openly call for him to sell the ski area, and an anonymous internet campaign has even cropped up to “chuck Chuck.”\n\n“We have an owner who’s unwilling to invest in his own company, his own resort, his own employees,” Paul Wisor, the town manager of the Mountain Village, said in an interview.\n\nNancy Clark, a spokeswoman for the ski resort, said the area was working on contingency plans that would allow it to reopen at least some of the mountain. She criticized the personal attacks against Mr. Horning as “over the top.”\n\n“Whether people like Chuck or not, what they may not realize is that their extreme nastiness impacts everyone at the ski resort,” she said in an email. “When people attack Chuck, they are indirectly attacking every single person who works at that resort.”\n\nThe strike and shutdown come during a bleak start to the winter for much of the Mountain West. Snow levels in Colorado are tied for the worst on record, and mountainsides around Telluride that would normally be gleaming white are brown and barren.\n\nAs a few meager flakes swirled on Saturday afternoon, Greg Shawcroft, 30, who runs a food cart in Mountain Village near the lift, was just hoping the snow would come and lifts would start spinning. He blamed Mr. Horning for the shutdown, but said his business could not afford much more pain.\n\n“I’m torn,” he said. “I want ski patrol to get what they deserve, but at what cost to the community?”",

    "fullText": "The British-English slang phrase the dog’s bollocks, also the bollocks, means the very best, the acme of excellence.\n\n(Remark: I have presented the origin of American-English synonyms such as the bee’s knees and the frog’s eyebrows in “the cat’s whiskers”, and all that jazz.)\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary (3rd edition – 2008) says that the bollocks is a shortening of the dog’s bollocks. However, since the latter phrase is attested in 1986, and the former in 1981, it is also possible that the bollocks actually predates the dog’s bollocks as a superlative.\n\nThe origin of this use of the dog’s bollocks/the bollocks is obscure. However, an explanation was given in Volume 1: A – I of The New Partridge1 Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English (Routledge, 2006), by Tom Dalzell and Terry Victor:\n\ndog’s bollocks; dog’s ballocks; the bollocks noun\n\nanything considered to be the finest, the most excellent, the best UK, 1989\n\nDerived from the phrase ‘It sticks out like a dog’s ballocks’2 said of something that the speaker considers obvious, hence the sense of ‘someone or something that sticks out from the rest’.\n\nThe same edition mentioned the use of dog’s ballocks in a different sense:\n\ndog’s ballocks noun\n\nin typography, a colon dash (:—) UK, 1961\n\n1 The New-Zealand born lexicographer Eric Honeywood Partridge (1894-1979) first published A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English in 1937.\n\n2 In this respect, it is interesting to remark that the British-English phrase a racing dog’s bollocks, attested in 1988, denotes something that protrudes.\n\nFor the explanation given in The New Partridge Dictionary to be plausible, the phrase it sticks out like a dog’s ballocks must predate the use of the dog’s bollocks/the bollocks in the sense ‘the most excellent’. This is possible, because:\n\n– the bollocks is attested in this sense in 1981, the dog’s bollocks in 1986;\n\n– it sticks out like a dog’s ballocks is recorded in the 8th edition (Routledge, 1984) of Eric Partridge’s A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English, edited by Paul Beale—this signifies that it sticks out like a dog’s ballocks predates the 8th edition by several years (Paul Beale goes as far as writing that it dates from “ca. 1920”, but without giving any attestation).\n\nThe following are the entries dog’s ballocks and dog’s prick in the 8th edition (Routledge, 1984) of Eric Partridge’s A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English, edited by Paul Beale—incidentally, dog’s prick is absent from the above-mentioned edition of The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English:\n\ndog’s ballocks. The typographical colon-dash (:—): C. 20. See dog’s prick.—2. Esp. in the phrase ‘It sticks out like a dog’s ballocks’, said of something that the speaker considers is patently obvious: low: since ca. 1920.\n\n[…]\n\ndog’s prick. An exclamation mark: authors’ and journalists’: C. 20.\n\nIn the 3rd edition (Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd., 1949) of A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English, Eric Partridge had recorded dog’s ballocks only in the sense ‘colon-dash’:\n\ndog’s ballocks. The typographical colon-dash (:—): C. 20. Cf. dog’s prick.\n\n[…]\n\ndog’s prick. An exclamation mark: authors’ and journalists’: C. 20.\n\nEARLIEST INSTANCE OF THE BOLLOCKS\n\nThe phrase the bollocks is first recorded as an expression of praise for the Yamaha TZ750 in the British magazine Super Bike of September 1981:\n\n“The Absolute Bollocks”\n\nWhen Superlatives Fail – Get Crude\n\nExclusive: We test Britain’s only road-going TZ 750\n\nEARLIEST INSTANCES OF THE DOG’S BOLLOCKS\n\nThe earliest known occurrence of the dog’s bollocks is from—or related to—the 1986 version of The Gambler, a musical by Peter Brewis, Bob Goody and Mel Smith, first staged at Hampstead Theatre, London, on 15th April of that year. The quotation in the 3rd edition of the Oxford English Dictionary is as follows:\n\nin P. Brewis et al. Gambler (cassette tape sleeve notes): ‘They are of the opinion that, when it comes to Italian opera, Pavarotti is the dog’s bollocks.’\n\nAnd, in Kick the Bucket and Swing the Cat: The Balderdash & Piffle Collection of English Words, and their Curious Origins (BBC Books, 2008), Alex Games explains:\n\nPeter Brewis […] told us of a play he wrote called The Gambler (along with Mel Smith and Bob Goody) which includes the immortal line ‘when it comes to Italian opera, Pavarotti is the dog’s bollocks’.\n\nThe phrase the dog’s bollocks then appeared as the title of the annual issue of the British comic magazine Viz for 1989:\n\nANOTHER HARD ONE\n\nVIZ\n\nTHE DOG’S BOLLOCKS\n\nTHE BEST OF ISSUES 26 TO 31\n\nNOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN, OLD FARTS OR GUARDIANS OF PUBLIC MORALS\n\nThe Liverpool Echo (Liverpool, Lancashire, England) mentioned that annual issue of Viz on Saturday 16th December 1989:\n\nTop Ten on Merseyside\n\n•B•O•O•K•S•\n\n1, The Greatest Batman Stories Ever Told, 2. The Pocket Wine Guide, Hugh Johnson, 3. Red Dwarf, Grant Naylor, 4. The Dogs [sic] Bollocks, VIZ Comic, 5. Bygone Merseyside, Derek Whale, 6. The Book Of Crap Jokes, VIZ Comic, 7. Demon Lord Of Karanda, David Eddings, 8. Delia Smith’s Complete Illustrated Cookery, 9, The Ginger Tree. Oswald Wynd, 10, Foucault’s Pendulum. Umberto Eco,\n\nThe earliest occurrence of the dog’s bollocks that I have found is from Desert rations keep the rats happy in Mandalay Drive, by David Sharrock, published in The Guardian (London and Manchester, England) of Friday 7th December 1990—the author reported from a British base somewhere in the eastern Arabian desert:\n\nAn invitation to lunch with the “Lowland Gunners,” 40 Field Regiment, was how the Desert Rats intended to dispel a few hoary old myths about army chow.\n\nMaybe it was something they put in the ill-famed compo rations, upon which the press stuffed themselves yesterday, but some of the 1,030 members of the Royal Artillery were enthusing about their new habitat.\n\n“It’s the dog’s bollocks,” grinned Gunner Mark Sparrow, aged 20, from Swindon. “It’s great, this is what I joined up for. I like everything about it, the weather, the sense of urgency.”",

    "fullText": "Candidates will have to sit assessments in person unless there are exceptional circumstances, says ACCA\n\nThe world’s largest accounting body is to stop students being allowed to take exams remotely to crack down on a rise in cheating on tests that underpin professional qualifications.\n\nThe Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), which has almost 260,000 members, has said that from March it will stop allowing students to take online exams in all but exceptional circumstances.\n\n“We’re seeing the sophistication of [cheating] systems outpacing what can be put in, [in] terms of safeguards,” Helen Brand, the chief executive of the ACCA, said in an interview with the Financial Times.\n\nRemote testing was introduced during the Covid pandemic to allow students to continue to be able to qualify at a time when lockdowns prevented in-person exam assessment.\n\nIn 2022, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the UK’s accounting and auditing industry regulator, said that cheating in professional exams was a “live” issue at Britain’s biggest companies.\n\nA number of multimillion-dollar fines have been issued to large auditing and accounting companies around the world over cheating scandals in tests.\n\nThe FRC’s investigation found that instances of cheating also included some tier-one auditors, a category comprising the “big four” accountants – KPMG, PwC, Deloitte and EY – along with Mazars, Grant Thornton and BDO.\n\nIn 2022, EY agreed to pay a record $100m (£74m) to US regulators over claims that dozens of its employees cheated on an ethics exam and that the company then misled investigators.\n\nThe ACCA said it had concluded that online tests have become too difficult to police, given the rise in artificial intelligence (AI) tools available to students.\n\nBrand said the ACCA, which has more than half a million students, had worked “intensively” to combat cheating but “people who want to do bad things are probably working at a quicker pace”.\n\nShe added that the rapid rise of technology, led by AI tools, had pushed the issue of cheating to a “tipping point”.\n\nLast year, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), which also trains accountants around the world, said reports of cheating were still increasing.\n\nHowever, the ICAEW still permits some exams to be sat online.\n\n“There are very few high-stakes examinations now that are allowing [remote invigilation],” Brand said.",

    "fullText": "Republican senator Katie Britt also proposes AI companies be criminally liable if they expose minors to harmful ideas\n\nUS senator Bernie Sanders amplified his recent criticism of artificial intelligence on Sunday, explicitly linking the financial ambition of “the richest people in the world” to economic insecurity for millions of Americans – and calling for a potential moratorium on new datacenters.\n\nSanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democratic party, said on CNN’s State of the Union that he was “fearful of a lot” when it came to AI. And the senator called it “the most consequential technology in the history of humanity” that will “transform” the US and the world in ways that had not been fully discussed.\n\n“If there are no jobs and humans won’t be needed for most things, how do people get an income to feed their families, to get healthcare or to pay the rent?” Sanders said. “There’s not been one serious word of discussion in the Congress about that reality.”\n\nDays from being scheduled to help swear New York mayor-elect and democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani into office, Sanders said “the richest people in the world” were pushing the technology. He singled out tech moguls Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel while questioning their motives.\n\n“You think they’re staying up nights worrying about working people and how this technology will impact those people?” Sanders said. “They are not. They are doing it to get richer and even more powerful.”\n\nSanders also pointed to studies that show dependence on AI chatbots for emotional support. “If this trend continues, what does it mean over the years when people are not getting their support, their interaction from other human beings, but from a machine?” he said. “What does that mean to humanity?”\n\nThat theme was taken up separately on State of the Union by Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican senator and co-sponsor of legislation to protect minors from chatbots.\n\nThe proposed measure – the Guardianship Over Artificial Intelligence Relationships (Guard) Act – seeks to ban providing AI companions to minors. It also mandates that AI companions disclose their non-human status and lack of professional credentials. The measure seeks to establish criminal liability if companies make AI companions available to minors that solicit or produce sexually explicit content – or encourage self-harm or violence.\n\nBritt said she had met with parents who have told her “devastating stories about their children where chatbots ultimately, when they kind of peeled everything back, had isolated them from their parents, had talked to them about suicide”.\n\nShe said: “If these AI companies can make the most brilliant machines in the world, they could do us all a service by putting up proper guardrails that did not allow for minors to utilize these things, that also told the user consistently that they are not a physician, they are not a psychiatrist, ‘I am a machine.’”\n\nBritt said AI companies should be held criminally liable if they create spaces where chatbots “are having these types of sensual and sexual relationships with young people or encouraging suicide”.\n\nThe remarks by Sanders and Britt offer a rare convergence of thinking from the left and right on aspects of the issue of governing AI. Sanders said Congress needed “to vigorously study the impact that AI is having on the mental health of our country”.\n\n“I worry very much about kids spending their entire days getting emotional support,” he added. “So we have got to take a hard look on that.” The senator said lawmakers need to be “thinking seriously” about a moratorium on new AI datacenters.\n\n“Frankly, I think you have got to slow this process down,” he said. “It’s not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us, it’s coming, you adapt. What are they talking about? They going to guarantee health care to all people?\n\n“What are they going to do when people have no jobs? What are they going to do, make housing free? So I think we need to take a deep breath, and I think we need to slow this thing down.”",

    "fullText": "PC, Xbox, PlayStation 5; Embark Studios\nThe breakout hit, which has players coming together (or turning on each other) to battle intimidating robots in an apocalyptic future, is worth the hype\n\nArc Raiders is an extraction shooter from Embark Studios – so, a game where you deploy into a map full of other players and do as much shooting and looting as you can before making an escape. This is my first real go at the genre, and it’s excellent. It has smooth, only occasionally cumbersome combat, sound design that scratches the brain just right and robotic enemies that genuinely terrify. And it satisfies my constant need to sift through my inventory and rifle through every drawer.\n\nBut I have to keep my head on a swivel: Arc Raider’s player v player element means I can get jumped for my precious cargo by a malicious rival at any moment. And also, the knowledge that this game was made with the help of generative AI voice acting makes me slightly ashamed of how much I enjoy it. I play every game sheepishly looking over my shoulder (and my character’s) in case someone in-game takes my sought-after blueprint, or someone in real life kicks down my door to call me a hypocrite.\n\nIt’s ever more difficult to avoid AI in everyday life. Arc Raiders has become my guilty pleasure. In it, you play as a raider in post-apocalyptic Italy, living underground but regularly heading topside to scrounge for supplies, after a massive ecological event destroyed human civilisation and strange autonomous robots showed up shortly afterwards to scour the scarred landscape. These ARC can fly overhead, roll around on the ground, or leap extraordinary distances on four mechanical legs. Each is uniquely deadly.\n\nYou are woefully inadequate in a battle against most of Arc Raiders’ enemies, which means you’ll need to scurry around to avoid them, throw noisemakers to distract them, or attack as a team, with either the squad you deployed alongside or other players you convince to join you over chat. All of this is in service of the game’s one true god: loot, which you need in order to perform everything from repairing your weapons to crafting medical supplies to training your pet rooster so he can fetch items for you on the surface. And you can only keep what you successfully escape with, so if you die mid-match or fail to get to an elevator or metro car before the timer runs out, it’s all gone.\n\nThough my first few rounds of Arc Raiders were supremely difficult and punishing (in my third match, I found several pieces of rare loot and was then ruthlessly murdered by a squad all clad in red), Embark has ensured that you can make progress fast. You can upgrade your raider’s mobility, stamina and stealthiness every time you level up, and you can earn experience through playing rounds and successfully extracting. You can recycle things into crafting materials to upgrade your weapons and shield, or sell trinkets to merchants for extra cash that will help you buy better equipment. Even after a bad round, you still get somewhere.\n\nAfter every successful extraction, I want to jump right back in for more. I want more close calls, accidental explosions and terrifying sprints through ruined cities. I want to hurl more expletives over chat so that other squads know I’m in the thick of it, walk past another player blasting A Thousand Miles by Vanessa Carlton through their microphone, usher another half-dozen more people into an elevator hatch before I press the button to close the door at the last second.\n\nArc Raiders isn’t just fun to play. It’s a straight-up shot of serotonin.",

    "fullText": "Gerstner was chair and CEO at a time when the firm was struggling for relevance faced with rivals such as Microsoft\n\nLouis Gerstner, the businessman credited with turning around IBM, has died aged 83, the company announced on Sunday.\n\nGerstner was chair and CEO of IBM from 1993 to 2002, a time when the company was struggling for relevance in the face of competition from rivals such as Microsoft and Sun Microsystems.\n\nAfter becoming the first outsider to run the company, Gerstner abandoned a plan to split IBM, which was known as Big Blue, into a number of autonomous “Baby Blues” that would have focused on specific product areas such as processors or software.\n\nIBM’s current chair and CEO, Arvind Krishna, told staff in an email on Sunday that this decision was key to the company’s survival because “Lou understood that clients didn’t want fragmented technology, they wanted integrated solutions.”\n\n“Lou arrived at IBM at a moment when the company’s future was genuinely uncertain,” he wrote.\n\n“The industry was changing rapidly, our business was under pressure, and there was serious debate about whether IBM should even remain whole. His leadership during that period reshaped the company. Not by looking backward, but by focusing relentlessly on what our clients would need next.”\n\nIBM had dominated the technology sector in the 1960s and 1970s with its mainframe computers. But having developed the IBM personal computer in 1981, the company lost ground in the booming PC market as competitors created “IBM-compatible” machines using Intel processors and Microsoft’s MS-DOS and Windows operating systems.\n\nGerstner startled reporters after arriving at the then loss-making IBM by declaring that “the last thing IBM needs right now is a vision” and insisting the top priority was restore the company to profitability and serve customers better.\n\nOne of his many decisions was to abandon its OS/2 operating system, which it had hoped to use to challenge Microsoft’s dominance of PC operating systems.\n\nGerstner had previously worked as president of American Express and CEO of RJR Nabisco before joining IBM. After he left, he chaired the Carlyle Group.\n\nKrishna said Gerstner had been a “direct” leader who expected preparation and challenged assumptions.\n\n“I have my own memory of Lou from the mid-1990s, at a small town hall with a few hundred people,” he told staff. “What stood out was his intensity and focus. He had an ability to hold the short term and the long term in his head at the same time.\n\n“He pushed hard on delivery, but he was equally focused on innovation, doing work that clients would remember, not just consume.”",

    "fullText": "TAMBACOUNDA, Senegal (AP) — On a blazing afternoon in Senegal, 33-year-old farmer Filly Mangassa heaved peanut plants onto a horse-drawn cart, sending clouds of dust swirling.\n\nTen years ago, he left his village for the capital, Dakar, dreaming of becoming a professor. But the high cost of living and lack of jobs put that dream out of reach.\n\n“Particularly after COVID, companies weren't hiring and prices were rising,” said Mangassa, who has a masters degree in criminology. “I thought: My father and my grandfather were farmers, so why not use that experience and go back to my hometown and try to make a living in agriculture.”\n\nAcross much of Africa, farming has long been seen as low-status work, pushing young people to cities in search of office jobs.\n\n“For my father and some people in my family, they sort of saw me returning to the countryside as a step back,” Mangassa said.\n\nBut that perception is changing. Rising food prices, investments in irrigation and access to new technologies are making agriculture more profitable. Governments and nonprofits now fund programs that teach advanced farming skills and support farmers with equipment, fertilizers, pesticides and seeds.\n\n“When my father saw that I had a clear, thorough business plan, he encouraged me and helped me with the administrative process to acquire land,” Mangassa said.\n\nHe is part of a trend of young Africans leaving cities to try their luck at farming. Mangassa says he makes a profit of around 2 million CFA ($3,500 a year), far above Senegal's average yearly income of about $2,500.\n\nAfrica is the world’s fastest-urbanizing region, with cities growing at an average rate of 3.5% per year. As city populations increase, so does the cost of living.\n\nMedian rents and grocery prices in places like Dakar or Kenya’s capital of Nairobi are approaching those of major European cities, despite median salaries being significantly lower, according to the World Bank.\n\nMeanwhile, between 10 and 12 million young Africans enter the job market each year while only about 3 million formal jobs are created, according to the African Development Bank.\n\n“A lot of my friends who graduated at the same time as me now work as motorcycle taxi drivers and barely make a living,” Mangassa said.\n\nHelping young farmers acquire land\n\nMangassa now owns a 32-acre farm where he grows peanuts, corn, vegetables and fruit. He received some funding to buy land from a World Food Program initiative helping young Africans start careers in agriculture.\n\nLaunched in 2023 and set to run through early 2027, it has supported around 380,000 people in launching agricultural businesses.\n\nIt works with local governments to allow young farmers to acquire land — often a challenge because of complex ownership systems and young people's difficulty in obtaining loans because they are seen as high risk.\n\nIn Senegal, the program has supported over 61,000 people, with more than 80% launching farms, according to WFP. It also operates in Ghana, Nigeria, Mozambique, Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya and Tanzania.\n\n“Our surveys show three main barriers for young people entering agriculture: limited access to land, financing and inputs; a lack of practical skills; and tough market conditions — knowing when to sell, how to add value and how to market their products,” said WFP’s country director for Senegal, Pierre Lucas.\n\nSenegal, like many African countries, is plagued by food insecurity that has been exacerbated by donors' funding cuts and worsening climate conditions.\n\nThe region also is recovering from the colonial era, said Ibrahima Hathie, an agricultural economist at the Senegal-based Prospective Agricultural and Rural Initiative think tank.\n\n“In Senegal for example, farmers were pressured to grow groundnuts to be sold in France instead of food crops,\" Hathie said.\n\nScarce arable land and soil degradation further constrain food production.\n\nBut now, many young farmers are shifting to high-value crops and have better technology, so production is increasing, Hathie said, predicting that as more locally produced food enters markets, staple prices could fall.\n\nFarming becomes an alternative to migration\n\nSenegal is a main departure point for migrants attempting to reach Europe via the deadly Atlantic route. Authorities see agriculture as one way to create jobs to keep young people at home, launching campaigns in rural areas most affected by migration.\n\n“I’m convinced that the only sector that can create the hundreds of thousands of jobs young people in Africa need is agriculture and livestock,” Senegal’s agriculture minister, Mabouba Diagne, told reporters in October.\n\nAdama Sane, 24, once dreamed of reaching Europe but didn't have money to pay smugglers. He had moved to Dakar in 2020 but struggled to make ends meet as a construction worker. Then he heard about the WFP initiative.\n\n“In a sense, discovering agriculture saved my life,” Sane said. “If I had stayed in my construction job, I would have tried crossing the ocean sooner or later.”\n\nHe now raises poultry and cultivates peppers on his five-acre farm in his village.\n\n“I am still far from where I want to be with my business, but at least I am saving a lot of money compared to the city, and life is less stressful,” Sane said. “A lot of young people think that being a farmer is a ‘small job,’ but there is starting to be a public awakening that agriculture can be the key to development in Senegal.\"\n\nThree other potential migrants are now working for Mangassa.\n\nMamadou Camara, 22, Issa Traoré, 22, and Madassa Kebe, 23, had been living in Mali's capital, Bamako, struggling to find work. Their families had helped them raise money for the Atlantic journey to Europe via Guinea-Bissau, but they said a smuggler there disappeared with it.\n\nThey decided to return home through Senegal, where they met Mangassa.\n\n“I empathized with them because I know what it’s like to work hard and still not make ends meet while your family depends on you,” Mangassa said. “I wanted to show them that there are opportunities for young people here.”\n\nFor more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse\n\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

    "fullText": "When I finally made $1 million, my friends and family expected me to share my wealth.\n\nI lost long-term friendships because money came between us.\n\nThrough therapy, I learned I don't have to show up for people financially.\n\nI'm a first-generation American who grew up in an immigrant household where finances were rarely discussed. I knew my mother and stepfather worked hard, sometimes with multiple jobs, but I was not aware of the specifics of their debt, savings, salaries, or how they managed their finances.\n\nWhen I was 14, my parents found religion, and it changed the trajectory of our lives. When I told my parents I didn't want to go to seminary and become a pastor, they kicked me out of their home when I was 17 years old.\n\nAt 18, I earned my commercial driver's license and started making money with my first business. That's when people started asking me for money, and the requests only intensified when I became a millionaire years later.\n\nI was working as a delivery driver for a bakery when I got the opportunity to start my first business, which involved deliveries. That business made a lot of money quickly.\n\nWhen my family and some friends saw how well the business was doing, they paid more attention to me. I thought those who'd been cold to me were coming around, but instead they asked for loans or for me to give them money outright.\n\nIn my 20s, I wasn't in a position to give away money, as I had started a family and bills to pay. That changed further down the line.\n\nI eventually sold my delivery company and started an online business because I wanted to work from anywhere.\n\nI've been building my online business since 2011, and it's only grown.\n\nIn 2023, I achieved a new level of financial success by surpassing the $1 million mark in cash collected. I set a goal for myself and made my first million.\n\nMy family, even those still living in Kenya, where my mom is from, and friends started to take notice of how well I was doing financially. I wasn't broadcasting how much money I was making, but those close to me could see the signs, such as upgrading our living situation, getting a new car, and paying for meals.\n\nThe family initially requested money slowly, but the requests became more frequent, and some became increasingly demanding. My close friends at the time asked for money to borrow, and they expected me to pay for everything when we went out for men's nights.\n\nThe requests for money came from everywhere, and even when I did decide to give family and friends some money, it was never seen as enough. I was often told I was being greedy.\n\nI spent a long time feeling like my only value was to earn money to give to others.\n\nIt took me years of feeling obligated to help family and friends before I woke up. I felt blessed to have created some wealth and believed it was my duty to help those in my life who were still struggling, even when I knew I shouldn't.\n\nTherapy helped me see that my low self-worth and feelings of abandonment were why I let people take advantage of me. Therapy helped me see that I'm more than what I could do for people financially.\n\nI had to cut off two of my best friends at the time because of issues with money. It hurt my soul to let go of friendships and cut off family, but I eventually understood it was the best decision for my mental health and financial future.\n\nAfter lots of therapy, I've consistently turned down family members who have asked for money more times than I can count. I've set boundaries, and I'll only give someone money when I feel comfortable about doing it.\n\nI've let go of the feeling of obligation and remind myself of the lesson I learned long ago: I'm responsible for my financial future and need to be wise with my money.\n\nOver the past 24 years, making a million dollars and building a successful business have taught me about the difference between genuine and superficial relationships. And that lesson has been priceless.",

    "description": "Only 32% of American millionaires consider themselves “wealthy.”",
    "fullText": "If you have $2 million in retirement savings, congratulations. That’s well above the $1.26 million that Americans, according to Northwestern Mutual, believe is needed to retire comfortably. (1)\n\nAt this point, you have probably overcome the challenge of saving enough. Now, your next mission is wealth preservation. Higher taxes and the wrong lifestyle choices can quickly erode what seems like a huge treasure trove.\n\nShifting your perspective from building wealth to protecting it isn’t easy. But the journey could be less treacherous if you avoid these five common money traps that high-net-worth individuals sometimes fall into.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nIf you follow the 4% rule, $2 million in retirement savings would give you $80,000 a year, adjusted for inflation. That could either be too much or too little, depending on where you live and how much you spend.\n\nLifestyle inflation — where your spending habits change with the size of your portfolio and paycheck — is a real risk. It’s perhaps one of the reasons why only 32% of American millionaires, according to Northwestern Mutual, consider themselves “wealthy.” (2)\n\nOf these millionaires, 70% who do not work with a financial advisor said they know how much money they need to retire comfortably. In other words, many high-net-worth individuals haven’t taken the time to plan their retirement budget and lifestyle needs.\n\nDon’t fall into the same trap. Consider hiring a financial advisor to help you craft a robust budget that you can stick to easily. While $2 million sounds like a lot, it can quickly disappear and might not be enough for everyone.\n\nIf much of your wealth is in tax-advantaged retirement accounts such as 401(k) plans and IRAs, you need to prepare for the tax consequences of making withdrawals in retirement.\n\nLess than half (49%) of millionaires without a financial advisor told Northwestern Mutual they consider how much taxes could eat into their retirement savings. Without a proper forecast of these taxes and a strategic plan to minimize taxes, you end up with a thinner-than-expected safety net in retirement.",

    "description": "You won’t need to sit down (or sit up) for this one",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nIf you’re looking to build real core strength, the kind that supports your spine, improves your compound movements, enhances posture and powers everyday movement, it’s time to focus on your deep core muscles while standing tall.\n\nAccording to Pvolve Head Trainer Dani Coleman (also known for training Jennifer Aniston), your core is far more than just your abs. “It’s 35+ muscles that stabilise, twist and support every movement you make,” she explains. “That’s why it makes sense to train your core with as much variety and functionality as possible.”\n\nSure, planks and crunches are very much the go-to core staples, but in a recent Instagram workout, Coleman demonstrates that you can build serious deep-core strength from a standing position. The best part? It’s easy to slot these moves into your day without needing much floor space (or a gym).\n\nThis four-move workout from Coleman requires just a single dumbbell, kettlebell, or even a heavy water bottle. All in all, it takes about eight minutes from start to finish, making it ideal as a finisher, warm-up, or quick standalone session.\n\nColeman doesn’t specify reps in her Instagram video, but a simple structure is: 50 seconds on, 10 seconds off. Repeat the circuit twice.\n\nPallof Press: An anti-rotation essential that teaches your core to resist twisting, which is key for protecting your spine. It builds trunk stability, reinforces proper alignment and strengthens the deep muscles that keep you steady as you move.\n\nGolf Swing: A controlled rotational movement that targets the obliques while improving mobility through the spine and hips. It also boosts coordination – useful for anything that involves reaching, throwing, or twisting.\n\nStep back to Hinge: This combination move fires up your core while challenging balance and hip mobility. It encourages stability as you move through a hinge pattern, helping you generate more strength and control in everyday tasks.\n\nStanding Deadbug: A smart standing variation of the classic deadbug. It strengthens the stabilisers that support your spine and improves coordination between your upper and lower body.\n\nStanding core exercises target the deep muscles we often overlook - including the transverse abdominis, obliques and pelvic floor, while keeping you upright and functional. Unlike traditional crunches, they train your core the way you use it most: standing, moving, twisting, lifting and reaching.\n\nAs Coleman explains, this “helps you perform daily tasks more easily and with more confidence” - and ultimately proves that core strength isn’t just aesthetic. It’s the foundation of a strong, resilient body.",

    "fullText": "A Ph.D. student affirmed that electric vehicles are better for the environment than cars with internal combustion engines.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, even with the energy required to manufacture a lithium battery, the emissions associated with EVs over a lifetime are lower than those from a gas-powered car.\n\nTikToker Rosh (@all_about_climate), a student with degrees in both Earth and climate science, posted a response to a common myth about EVs. In the video, Rosh showed a clip of someone who said the energy used to mine lithium for EV batteries has a greater environmental impact than gas-powered cars.\n\nWhile Rosh said there are some environmental consequences from EV battery production, the TikToker rejected the idea that internal combustion engines are better for the planet.\n\nIn the video, Rosh presented a graph from Generation Investment Management which showed that other metals were mined significantly more than lithium in 2022. For example, about 1.3 million kilotonnes of iron were mined compared to 130 kilotonnes of lithium.\n\n\"The idea that it's worse or even comparable to what we are currently doing to maintain the fossil fuel status quo is completely wrong,\" Rosh said.\n\nThe EPA said the planet-friendly vehicles have a smaller carbon footprint than their gas counterparts because they have zero tailpipe emissions. In fact, a new study found that EVs zero out their carbon footprint in just two years on the road.\n\nThe transportation sector is the largest source of air pollution in the country. Switching to an EV can keep pollution out of the atmosphere and help you avoid paying for maintenance and high gas prices.\n\nHundreds of TikTok users responded to Rosh's video. Many commenters agreed with Rosh's defense of EVs and the manufacturing of lithium batteries.\n\n\"The oil guy in the video reminds me of a tobacco company owner saying smoking is good,\" one commenter quipped.\n\nDo you think EVs charge too slowly?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"[You] hear that all the time and it is 100% wrong,\" another commenter said. \"Basically propaganda from the oil industry. Lithium batteries can be fully recycled.\"\n\nResearchers are also constantly working on making battery recycling more efficient to create a circular economy with these batteries.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Dr. Oz's remarks may get written off as a joke, but there is nothing funny about the undercurrent of what his words actually mean.",
    "fullText": "“We’ve dropped (the price of) the infertility drugs to make lots of Trump babies, I’m hoping by the midterms.” That bizarre remark was made recently by Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nAfter four years of the first Trump administration and nearly one year into the second, many of us have become desensitized to this kind of commentary – but not Black women. We know the quiet part spoken out loud when we hear it.\n\nDr. Oz’s remarks may get written off as a joke, but there is nothing funny about the undercurrent of what his words actually mean. This administration will stop at nothing to ensure the political dominance of White people in this country.\n\n“Trump babies” born ahead of the midterm elections in 2026 won’t vote until 2044, but after decades of listening to phrases like “welfare queens,” we know a dog whistle when we hear one. To understand this moment, it helps to look across generations.\n\nMore than 60 years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act and the Immigration and Nationality Act. One cannot underestimate the impact of that generation’s monumental moment on what’s happening today.\n\nThis seminal 1965 pair of laws “democratized the idea of who could be an American” and who could vote, as recently reported by The New Yorker writer Jelani Cobb.\n\nOpinion: Americans are shifting away from wanting kids. I'm worried for my generation.\n\nTwenty years from now, the White population in America will fall below 50%. Non-White births already exceed those of White Americans, and non-White children under age 15 already outnumber White children.\n\nThat reality should usher in a more inclusive democracy. Instead, White supremacists see it as an existential threat.\n\nThe MAGA movement intends to preserve power at all costs. Its four-part plan for stopping this demographic tsunami includes voter suppression, undermining reproductive justice, drastically reducing the number of non-White children who grow up to be voters through targeted deportations and incentivizing U.S. births among “traditional families.”\n\nFirst is the strategic disenfranchisement of Black and Latino voters by gutting the Voting Rights Act, culling us from voter lists and gerrymandering the elimination of congressional seats representing Black and Brown constituencies.\n\nSecond is pricing out low-income parents from having the economic and reproductive autonomy to choose their family sizes. The cost to raise a U.S. child born in 2015 to age 18 is estimated to be $320,000, and with families of color facing disproportionate levels of poverty, slashing safety net programs will only make it harder for people in our communities to have children.\n\nIn fact, recent state polling from In Our Own Voice found that financial insecurity is a top concern among Black adults as to why they are not growing their families. This will only be exacerbated as federal budget cuts and inflation make basic necessities like childcare, shelter and nutrition increasingly out of reach.\n\nAt the same time, the poor quality of care in our health system, underscored by the recent experiences of two Black women, Karrie Jones in Texas and Mercedes Wells in Indiana, both of whom were dismissed while in active labor, shows how dangerous and unequal the path to parenthood has become.\n\nSlashing Medicaid for millions will cripple critical care for more than a quarter of Black and Latina women, more than half of Black girls and, in a shift too significant to ignore, two-thirds of Black births.\n\nThird, we are witnessing our government’s brutal kidnappings and deportations of Black and Brown immigrants of reproductive age and their children. Along with attacking birthright citizenship, limiting international student visas and admitting only White Afrikaners as refugees, these nativist policies set the stage for shrinking pathways for America’s non-White population.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app? Download it for free from your app store.\n\nAnd fourth, White families must have more babies. While the administration’s early ideas – a $1,000 “baby bonus” and medals for mothers of six – may sound harmless, they point to the concerning rise of America’s pronatalism movement.\n\nWith unmistakable echoes of eugenics, its White, religious, conservative champions are pushing for more births among married, heterosexual couples and for children engineered for high intelligence and other so-called desirable traits.\n\nIn this context, the push for a new generation of “Trump babies” fits squarely within a broader strategy to dictate who gets to be born, who gets to stay and who ultimately gets to participate in American democracy.\n\nOpinion: Liberals aren't having kids, conservatives are. That matters.\n\nIt’s long past time for the opposition to stop reacting to executive orders, shutdowns and political theater and start listening to Black women. The “Trump babies” remark and ideology foreshadow a weakened and deeply unequal democracy.\n\nSo let’s call this what it is: a generational war by those clinging to power to “Make America Great Again” by preserving White dominance of American political, economic and cultural life; dramatically reducing Black and Latinobirths andsuffrage;and neutralizing a demographic tipping point that will permanently end White majority in the United States.\n\nBecause this is a generational strategy, it demands a generational response – one rooted in truth, organized power and an unwavering commitment to the dignity, agency and futures of Black, Brown and immigrant communities.\n\nRegina Davis Moss, a public health expert and author with a specialty in Black maternal health, is president and CEO of In Our Own Voice: National Black Women’s Reproductive Justice Agenda.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our USA TODAY columnists and other writers on the Opinion front page, on X, formerly Twitter, @usatodayopinion and in our Opinion newsletter.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: 'Trump babies' reveal GOP's long game: Voter suppression | Opinion",

    "fullText": "Just like a long line of executives before them, leaders of some of the world's hottest firms are learning to hate an age-old enemy: short sellers.\n\nLast month, Palantir CEO Alex Karp had a meltdown of sorts about the subject. When asked about short sellers, aka investors betting against the company's stock, Karp unloaded on the naysayers.\n\n\"They could pick on any company in the world. They have to pick on the one that actually helps people, that's actually made money for the average person, that is actually supporting our war fighters,\" Karp said on CNBC. (It should be noted that some would debate that characterization; Palantir is often criticized for its work with the US government on surveillance and immigration enforcement.)\n\n\"These people, they claim to be ethical,\" Karp continued, adding that \"they're actually shorting one of the great businesses of the world.\"\n\nSam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, also recently expressed his discontent with those who are skeptical about his firm's valuation. While his company is private, Altman said he sometimes wishes it were public so that he could take it to short sellers.\n\n\"There are not many times I want to be a public company, but one of the rare times that it's appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous, 'OpenAI is about to go out of business,'\" Altman told the Bg2 Pod in October. \"I would love to tell them they could just short the stock, and I would love to see them get burned on that.\"\n\nAnd while he hasn't been as outspoken about short-sellers per se, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang responded to AI bubble concerns during the firm's earnings call in November, saying \"there's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\" and \"from our vantage point, we see something very different.\"\n\nThese rising titans of the AI era are the latest business moguls to direct their ire at short sellers. The distaste for investors who put their money on the line to bet that a company's shares will decline is a decadeslong tradition. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has famously battled investors who have bet against the electric vehicle maker. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen has called the practice \"un-American.\" The pushback it's understandable: executives put a massive amount of work into building and running their companies, and when someone bets against them, it can feel personal.\n\nHowever, CEOs like Karp need to understand that attracting the attention of shorts is part of the natural life cycle of a company and a healthy market mechanism that allows a range of views to compete. One could even argue that Karp should take pride in the fact that he's grown his company to a size that draws such fervent skeptics. In a sense, it's a badge of honor. He's made it to the big leagues.\n\nInvesting in a company you believe in is straightforward: simply buy the stock. Betting against a company by shorting its stock, on the other hand, is a bit more complex. To do it, an investor borrows shares from their brokerage and agrees to return them by a specified date. The investor then sells the borrowed shares in the open market. When it's time to return the shares to the lender, the investor purchases the agreed-upon amount at the prevailing market price. If the price of the stock falls within that time, the short-seller can then buy back the shares at a lower price, earning a profit. If they got it wrong and the company's stock is higher, well, they've lost money. For example, if you think a company's stock is overvalued at $100 a share, you can borrow 10 shares from a broker for a total value of $1,000. You agree to give the shares back at the end of the month. On the day the deadline hits, if the stock has fallen to $50 a share, you buy up the amount you need to return and pocket a tidy $500 gain. But if that stock were to get hot instead, and rises to $300 a share, you're out $2,000 — a nasty hit. It goes without saying that short-selling can be extremely risky. While a long investor can lose all of their money, a short-seller can, in theory, lose infinite sums.\n\nIt's especially tricky to short small companies. Since there are fewer investors buying and selling their shares, even small amounts of buying can cause the price to rise dramatically. This can create problems for short sellers if they suddenly need to return the shares to their lender, a process known as covering their position. If the supply of shares is low and demand suddenly increases, it can drive the price of a stock through the roof, cutting the short seller even deeper. It's a phenomenon known as a short squeeze, and it's what famously happened to short sellers Gabe Plotkin and Andrew Left during the GameStop saga.\n\n\"Short sellers absolutely want to make sure they have plenty of liquidity, and so that's why it's so dangerous to short something that's pretty small,\" said Ryan Kelley, the chief investment officer at Hennessy Funds, which manages around $4 billion.\n\nDerivatives markets, more complex financial products that allow for even more exotic bets on the direction of a stock, also become larger when a stock becomes more prominent, thereby providing the opportunity for more people to bet against a company. After all, to short a stock, you need an investor to lend shares to you.\n\n\"The reality is, as companies get bigger, the derivatives market in companies grows. And as the derivatives market grows, there's more folks that will be taking positions,\" said Maurits Pot, the founder of Tema ETFs, which manages around $1 billion after launching in 2023.\n\nSo, the fact that Palantir is drawing short-sellers is, in a way, a badge of honor for Karp. When you get as big as Palantir — which is up 1,720% since its IPO in October 2020 — short bets are going to happen. Sure, some of these increased bets are because there are more people who think the company is on the wrong path, but a lot of times, short interest can increase for more technical reasons — many of them to do with the size of the company. When a company grows, so does the variety of opinions on its stock performance. And that's OK.\n\nThere are several reasons shorting is a necessary component of a robust market.\n\nFirst, short-sellers act as a check, helping to call out companies for a range of bad behaviors, from corporate malfeasance to incompetent management. On the extreme end, short sellers have used research, data analysis, and information gathering to expose cases of serious fraud, accounting tricks, and blatant deception. For example, fraudulent behavior at the pharmaceutical company Valeant was exposed in 2015 when short-sellers sounded the alarm about the firm. On the more quotidian side, investors betting against a company have called out executives and management teams for taking a company in the wrong direction. Some individuals will do it publicly, sharing their thesis for why a stock is overvalued. But since the amount of short interest can be tracked, a rising number of quieter short bets can make investors and regulators more aware of the risks associated with a particular firm. In these instances, short sellers have a financial interest in seeing the stock go down, but they are also trying to serve the public interest.\n\n\"It's a possibility that people can be adamantly against the way you're running a business,\" Kelley said, \"and it should be that they're able to actually put their money where their mouth is — in other words, short the stock and be vocal about it.\"\n\nIn other cases, short sellers may not think the company itself is doing anything egregious, but rather that other investors in the market are overreacting. Tesla's stock has often traded at nosebleed valuations due to its fanatical investor following, drawing short interest simply because it has traded above its fundamentals at times.\n\nOf course, there are bad actors — some short sellers have been charged with taking a short position on a stock and then drumming up negative headlines about the company to send its share price tumbling, sometimes coordinating with other short sellers. In other words, not simply talking their book, but being disingenuous or lying. These more questionable motivations make short sellers an easy target, and are likely what raised Karp's rankles. But the notion that short-selling in and of itself is harmful is not fair, Pot said.\n\n\"The idea that you can't be shorting, I think that's — I wouldn't say it's anti-competitive — but it impedes the natural impulse of the market, which is that there are companies that are shorted for good reason,\" Pot said.\n\n\"Short selling is core to the market,\" Pot continued, \"and I think as long as short selling doesn't become a coordinated, speculative attack, I think it's part of the regular functioning of capital markets.\"\n\nIn this same vein, short sellers can temper the euphoria in bubble periods. When the market is ripping and Wall Street strategists are loath to issue a downbeat, bearish forecast, it can be helpful to hear arguments for why a standout stock or a particularly hot market theme has gone too far. And because losses can be infinite for short sellers, putting their money where their mouth is tells you about their degree of conviction. It's essentially what Michael Burry — who gained fame shorting the housing market leading up to the 2008 crash — did a few weeks ago, when he questioned the assumed rate of depreciation on GPUs, arguing that they'll become obsolete in just a couple of years. With this argument now at the top of investors' minds, you might argue that stocks are more efficiently priced.\n\nAnother important role that short sellers play is providing liquidity in the market. While an investor would ordinarily hold their shares, lending them to a short-seller to auction off to the market allows these shares to continue circulating through the system. And when they eventually have to cover their positions and repurchase their shares, they provide exit liquidity to people looking to sell. Higher liquidity levels enable investors to enter and exit positions more quickly and at closer proximity to the market price.\n\nExecutives like Karp shouldn't take short-selling to heart. Instead, they should recognize its important market function, and wear it as a feather in their cap — a sign that their company is maturing into adulthood.\n\nWilliam Edwards is a senior investing reporter at Business Insider primarily covering the US stock market and the broader economy.",

    "description": "For Wall Streeters, finding the time to shop for presents can be tough.",
    "fullText": "Work schedules don't always have much sympathy for holiday plans — especially the notoriously grueling hours of the finance industry.\n\nWhen it comes to carving out time for gifting, some Wall Streeters opt to outsource the task, while others shop at convenient stores close to, or even within, their offices.\n\n\"This time of year, time seems to move a little bit faster,\" said Elisabeth Brown, the director of US membership at luxury travel and lifestyle concierge company Knightsbridge Circle.\n\nBrown said that gift help is a popular service among members, and that Knightsbridge Circle will suggest, buy, and even deliver items. Members devote time to talking about their preferences, and later to approving purchases, but otherwise pass off the responsibility.\n\nOther finance employees turn to personal shoppers for help. David Thielebuele, the fashion director of ready-to-wear at Bloomingdale's, said in an email that people turn to personal shoppers for a mix of \"convenience and expertise,\" especially during the end-of-year crunch. The personal shopping team can refine lists, buy items, and build event wardrobes.\n\n\"The real challenge is decision fatigue,\" Thielebuele said. Many clients can only devote fragmented chunks of time to gifting, he added, compounding the issue.\n\nFor those who do handle the shopping on their own, though, stores near the office can offer an easy solution. Jeremy Balrup, who covers sales and analytics for Bloomberg's enterprise data business and has worked in finance for around a decade, said he often stops by department stores near his office in Midtown Manhattan to buy gifts. If he's buying a sweater, he said he'll visit the J. Press store in Grand Central.\n\nThose who work at Goldman Sachs might not even have to leave the office to pick up gifts. The firm hosts a holiday market in New York, London, and Dallas offices, featuring graduates of its 10,000 Small Businesses program. Around 80 vendors sold their items between the fairs, and Goldman's global head of corporate engagement, Asahi Pompey, called it \"one of the most joyful days on our calendar.\"\n\nFor some, the holiday commitment goes beyond shopping alongside colleagues.\n\nIn a Business Insider survey about Wall Street gifting, about 40% of the respondents who said they work in finance said they were considering buying their colleagues presents. The most popular items to get them were wine or liquor, according to the unscientific survey, and Balrup said that a nice bottle is always a hit in his office's white elephant game.\n\nEileen Rizzo, the CEO of Zachys Wine and Liquor, said that her company's analytics show that people with interests in banking and investment are among the most active audience segments, and that New York is the most active market. Champagne is always hugely popular around the holidays, and Italian and Bordeaux wines are also highly requested, she said. Zachys' top customers tend to spend around $900 per order.\n\nAnd when it comes to what Wall Streeters want for themselves? Watches seem to be all the rage.",

    "fullText": "It's been the first full year of Starbucks' CEO Brian Niccol's \"Back to Starbucks\" mission. So, how did it go?\n\nWell, let's not beat around the bush: From a shareholder's perspective, pretty meh. By late December, Starbucks' stock had declined by more than 5% over the past year, compared to the broader stock market, which had increased by more than 16%.\n\nBut that's not what counts most with me, a consumer of Starbucks coffee (and its free public bathrooms).\n\nNiccol's big vision was a return to Starbucks' glory days as a destination coffee shop where people wanted to sit and stay while sipping a drink — not a drive-thru for sugar syrup slop drinks ordered by phone.\n\nI fully welcome a few of the changes. Others, not so much.\n\nFor one thing, he axed 13 unpopular and complicated drinks from the menu. Goodbye to Caramel Ribbon Crunch Crème Frappuccino and farewell to Royal English Breakfast Latte. I never even knew you existed.\n\nAnother change I welcomed: a plan to offer more late-afternoon snacks, like the \"appertivo\" menu in some of the European Starbucks. Hey, I love an afternoon snack! To test out Niccol's new plans, I headed out to a nearby Starbucks in the afternoon and had a very pleasant treat of something savory and something sweet. The newish falafel wrap was a hit, in my mind. I'd look forward to more afternoon-targeted items.\n\nOne last change that is a long time coming: finally charging people more for extra syrups and powder add-ons. I don't want my plain coffee subsidizing you sickos out there who ask for it with six scoops of matcha powder or eight pumps of caramel syrup. Niccol seemed to have learned from his time as Chipotle CEO that we should all understand that guac is extra.\n\nBut there was one big change that I think is a stinker: mandating that baristas doodle or write a cutesy message on the cups.\n\nAlthough some baristas don't mind doing it — or even enjoy it! — I found plenty of Starbucks employees and customers talking online who thought the new policy was onerous and silly.\n\nA Starbucks spokeswoman told me that writing on the cups was part of creating a warm environment: \"We believe in the power of genuine human connection — and we know that even the smallest gesture, like a handwritten note on a cup, can spark joy for our customers and partners [employees] alike.\"\n\nWell, I contend that — especially when stories get busy — no one wants to waste time making smiley faces on cups — and no customers want to wait, either. But more than anything, I find this forced whimsy to be cloyingly saccharine (and I say this as a lifelong Sweet'n Low user).\n\nFor 2026? I'd just like to see a return of the triangle-shaped espresso brownies.",

    "description": "Investors at 18 VC firms shared where they're investing, what they think is overhyped, and how they expect the tech market to shift in 2026.",
    "fullText": "If January is for resolutions, it's also for predictions — and in 2026, venture capital is placing its bets on tiny teams, personal agents, and a reckoning for wildly overpriced tech startups.\n\nIn recent years, companies dumped money into generative artificial intelligence tools that promised to help them work smarter and faster. The spending spree fattened revenue for companies selling copilots for coding, customer service, sales, and search — and sent their valuations soaring.\n\nNow investors say the next phase is payback. Enterprises will demand measurable returns to keep spending, and the AI companies that can't prove value may find their software renewals harder, fundraising tougher, and exits further away. As Venky Ganesan, a partner at Menlo Ventures, put it: \"2026 is the 'show me the money' year for AI.\"\n\nBusiness Insider asked investors at 18 venture capital firms, including Khosla Ventures, CapitalG, Sapphire Ventures, and Greycroft to share their predictions for what's next: where they're investing, what they think is overhyped, and how they expect the market to shift in the year ahead.\n\nFrom IPOs to ROI, these are the tech trends to watch in 2026, according to venture capitalists.\n\nCathy Gao, partner at Sapphire Ventures: We will start treating AI agents like junior staff with job titles, budgets, and spending limits. Once an agent can issue a refund or buy inventory, it stops being a tool and becomes a worker. This flips the business model from paying for access to paying for work completed, like tickets resolved or dollars recovered.\n\nLindsey Li, investor at Bessemer Venture Partners: In 2026, many companies will realize that the AI-written code they've produced over the last two years is often inconsistent, hard to understand, and difficult to maintain. At the same time, a new class of agents will emerge that specialize in debugging, refactoring, and cleaning up large codebases, effectively serving as automated maintainers.\n\nTomasz Tunguz, founder and general partner of Theory Ventures: The typical white collar worker will manage 50 agents daily in 2 years.\n\nBrian Bustamante-Nicholson, partner at Greycroft: Within the consumer space, we've been seeing companies do more with less for last four years. Remote work liberated companies to hire 10x employees all over the world and that naturally resulted in smaller, more efficient teams. Now we're seeing AI impact areas like creative and digital marketing, enabling companies to rely less on both internal hires and agencies to produce campaigns. We expect this trend will only accelerate into 2026, and consumer companies will continue to increase their runways.\n\nJared Heyman, managing partner at Rebel Fund: The trend towards startups becoming increasingly capital efficient is undeniable. Startups are using AI to build AI that other startups use to build more AI — and the cycle continues. As a result, small teams can build way more, way faster, than they could even a few months ago. In 2026, we'll see very small teams achieve extreme revenue growth — perhaps even over $100 million of ARR with just a few cofounders and employees.\n\nManthan Shah, head of US investments at WestBridge Capital: Humans communicate primarily through voice, and that creates a massive opportunity for AI systems that can speak, listen, and interact in a human way. We are still at the very beginning of this shift, but I expect to see a surge in both horizontal and deeply vertical voice-driven applications that effectively replicate human interaction and unlock entirely new business models. Once voice becomes a true platform, it will open the door for a new generation of companies that build products that behave less like software and more like another person in the room.\n\nSimon Wu, partner at Cathay Innovation: If the last two years were dominated by text-based LLMs, 2026 is when enterprises finally move to AI that can listen and see. Voice AI becomes the default for customer support, sales, and service workflows, while video AI emerges as critical infrastructure for robotics, field operations, and enterprise analytics. Expect at least one breakout company to raise a major round in 2026 and position \"multimodal intelligence\" — especially voice and video comprehension — as its core differentiator.\n\nVenky Ganesan, partner at Menlo Ventures: 2026 is the \"show me the money\" year for AI. Enterprises will need to see real ROI in their spend, and companies need to see meaningful increases in productivity growth to keep the AI spend and infrastructure going. Given some of the aggressive spend in AI, you will see a major AI company go bankrupt or have severe financial issues.\n\nMedha Agarwal, general partner at Defy.vc: 2026 will be the year AI spending meets ROI reality. Enterprises will demand hard returns from AI investments, and many pilots will be delayed, scaled back, or cancelled if value doesn't materialize.\n\nRob Biederman, managing Partner at Asymmetric Capital Partners: In 2026, the gap between AI products with tangible, well-defined ROI and those that are perceived as nice-to-have will widen and define outcomes for companies in a way that's been lost during the mania of the last few years. We feel strongly that in 2026 corporate boards and executive teams will begin focusing on payback from AI investment as costs continue to rise with less clear business impact.\n\nRajeev Dham, partner at Sapphire Ventures: In 2026, accounting and finance will become among the fastest-growing categories in enterprise AI. The pressure on companies to modernize the stack creates the perfect demand environment — yet unlike legal, the market still lacks a \"Harvey for finance.\" I believe this vacuum represents one of the largest untapped enterprise AI opportunities.\n\nLindsey Li, investor at Bessemer Venture Partners: Excel and financial spreadsheets become the next major AI breakout vertical. After code generation and customer support, we expect finance workflows particularly in Excel to see the next wave of real AI adoption. Financial modeling and reporting are structured but still largely manual, making them well suited for AI to help build models, clean and organize data, and surface key insights.\n\nSheena Jindal, founder and managing partner at Sugar Free Capital: Outsized technical depth is going to be critical for founders. The acquihire frenzy of 2025 has shown us that premium prices are paid for exceptional founders. As the tech giants remain active with acquisitions, earlier exits via acquihires and M&A will continue to be a new driver of IRR for pre-seed and seed firms who typically have years to wait before DPI.\n\nSarah Du, investor at Uncork Capital: Founders will continue to skew younger than in the pre-AI era. Given the rapid pace of evolution in the space, even experienced founders are learning alongside first-time founders. Speed now matters more than tenure, and younger founders are on a more level playing field than before.\n\nEthan Choi, partner at Khosla Ventures: We'll have the first of dramatic anti-AI protests in certain countries with white collar workers, not blue collar workers, demanding job security in the face of AI disruption.\n\nTamara Steffens, managing director at Thomson Reuters Ventures: The IPO window will continue to open in 2026, fueled by pressure from early investors and improved market stability.\n\nBrian Bustamante-Nicholson, partner at Greycroft: The backlog of companies looking to go public is very healthy. In our view, the administration will continue to capitulate on economic policies that have adversely impacted the US economy and created uncertainty in the capital markets. A few marquee, bellwether IPOs frequently mentioned, like SpaceX, could open the gates and create some urgency with strategics to acquire versus wait as IPOs prove a viable path to liquidity.\n\nTomasz Tunguz, founder and general partner of Theory Ventures: We think M&A continues to accelerate especially with the demand for AI talent at a premium. This will increase the cadence of acquihires as well as multibillion-dollar acquisitions.\n\nSarah Du, investor at Uncork Capital: Big tech and frontier labs will keep scooping up teams to secure AI talent. Some founders may intentionally build with this in mind — optimizing for technical breakthroughs and acquisition potential rather than long-term independence.\n\nDeedy Das, partner at Menlo Ventures: A lot of AI valuations will take a markdown, squeezing compensation for AI researchers at tier-1 startups. The best AI companies will continue to succeed but maybe not at the extent that they'd thought.\n\nEthan Choi, partner at Khosla Ventures: We are seeing even more egregious valuations and behavior from founders and investors relative to ZIRP times and I have a hard time seeing how we can sustain these kinds of private valuations without commensurate explosive revenue materializing.\n\nNnamdi Okike, cofounder and managing partner, 645 Ventures: Both public and private investors will regain discipline and apply a much stricter lens to their AI investments. While the correction will begin with hyperscalers and foundation model companies, it will eventually impact the entire AI stack, including application companies. This will have a ripple effect across the tech markets. The receding tide will result in reduced valuations in 2027 in both public and private markets.\n\nShawn Carolan, partner at Menlo Ventures: 2026 will see AI agents autonomously creep into your entire digital life — not just ordering lunch, but negotiating better rates on your behalf, proactively canceling services you've stopped using, and handling complex multi-step tasks like planning and booking trips. The question won't be \"Can AI book a restaurant?\" but, \"How much of my life do I want AI to control?\"\n\nMedha Agarwal, general partner at Defy.vc: Consumer AI crosses a cultural threshold in 2026. AI companionship becomes socially acceptable. People will post about their AI assistants, talk openly about their AI friends, and integrate AI relationships into everyday conversation.\n\nMo Jomaa, partner at CapitalG: While 2025 was the year of \"agent experimentation\" with fragile demos, 2026 will be the year of \"agents in production\" — but only if the infrastructure catches up.\n\nMatt Murphy, partner at Menlo Ventures: The training data market, e.g. Mercor and Handshake, explodes as large and small model developers race to create models that are the best at very specific skill sets. This dramatically accelerates innovation in a broad set of verticals with legal and healthcare as the early movers, but also at risk of overfunding. The new frontier is the next 100 verticals.\n\nAaron Holiday, cofounder and managing partner at 645 Ventures: Generative AI coding tools like Replit, Loveable, and Cursor are lowering the barriers to entry so dramatically that founders who previously lacked engineering resources or traditional credentials can now build and ship products at unprecedented speed.\n\nThe fluidity from idea to software product will lead to a surge in startup formation and product releases at a scale the industry has never seen before.",

    "description": "After-work pints have long been a sacred tradition of British workers. Has COVID and the world of hybrid work changed that?",
    "fullText": "It's not yet 5 pm on a Thursday in late November, and the skies have fully darkened over the City of London's Leadenhall Market. It's the coldest day in recent memory, a harbinger of the looming winter, but no matter.\n\nHere in London, it's time for a pint.\n\nAfter-work pints have been a sacred tradition of British workers for centuries. For years, Leadenhall Market has been the go-to spot for bankers, insurance brokers, and financial advisors who work in the City, the financial center of London.\n\nBut reports of waning nightlife due to a post-pandemic hangover and Gen Z's growing disinterest in drinking have worried pub-goers and publicans alike.\n\nOver a quarter - 26% - of people in the UK, 16 to 24-year-olds reported themselves as not having an alcoholic drink in a year, according to the most recent Health Survey for England conducted by the National Health Service in 2022. That's the highest percentage of any age group.\n\nThis December, research group IWSR said that Brits are drinking less than ever before, with the average person in the UK having just over 10 drinks a week, down almost 30% from previous highs.\n\nGiven these fears, the Mayor of London has even assembled a task force to help \"protect, retain and grow nightlife\" in the nation's capital.\n\nWrapped up in my warmest scarf and gloves, I paid a visit to this mecca of City nightlife to find out firsthand whether these reports of dampened spirits were true.\n\nNon-locals might not expect a sea of finance bros in this historic covered market, fitting of the Harry Potter universe — probably because it is a scene from that universe. In 2001, Leadenhall Market was used as the exterior of the Leaky Cauldron in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\n\nThe pathways are lined with cobblestones, and the red columns and arched ceilings have been decorated with ornaments. In the center of the market, a Christmas tree towered over tourists with selfie sticks.\n\nBut if you work in the City — the financial center of London — you know that the real attraction of Leadenhall Market is Thursday evening pints.\n\nWhen I arrived just before the clock struck happy hour, the market's alleys were already lively. Men and women dressed almost exclusively in black and brown coats were packed into the barriers outside the pubs, despite the bitter cold.\n\n\"You get used to it,\" Callum, a 26-year-old working as a recruiter in financial services, said with a shrug. \"A beer jacket is a great thing to have.\"\n\nAdmittedly, these crowds aren't quite what I was expecting.\n\nThe data indicate that London hasn't quite recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, with the city losing a fifth of its late-night venues since 2020, according to a report published in August from the Nighttime Industries Association.\n\nNot everyone's mourning this loss. Some embrace it.\n\nOutside The Swan, I chat with a group of young men who are out for a birthday celebration.\n\n\"He's 26,\" said Joy, who works in insurance, pointing to his friend. \"Pushing 30.\"\n\nJoy, solidly a member of Gen Z, said he doesn't hang around Leadenhall Market too much.\n\n\"Previous generations, it would just be this, just drinking,\" he says of after-work corporate culture. \"But we do a lot more stuff as well, like sports. We play football or padel.\"\n\nDrinking is expensive, for one, and the inflation rate for alcohol leapt after the pandemic. The cost of living is a factor, as is the desire to be healthy and develop meaningful friendships.\n\n\"It's about trying to find a way to connect to others,\" added Michael, also a 24-year-old insurance worker. \"And it helps you drink less than previous generations.\"\n\nJoy and Michael aren't cutting out alcohol entirely. They're out tonight for a special celebration, and Michael mentions that after volleyball practice, he and his fellow players go out for a pint or two. But it's a more moderate approach than their older colleagues, they agreed.\n\nCaroline, a bartender who has worked at Leadenhall Market for 13 years, says that things didn't take too long to return to normal.\n\n\"The City of London is sort of different from other sites. People spend money in this area,\" Caroline said.\n\nStill, things look a little different. Not as many Gen Z-ers buy rounds, Caroline told me, although she's noticed the younger generations are taking more shots than they once did.\n\nBut the biggest difference is the Thursday-ification of after-work drinking culture.\n\nFriday used to be the big night out, but things have changed largely due to the hybrid working culture now present in much of the corporate world.\n\n\"On Friday, most people aren't working in the City,\" Alex, who works in software, told me outside a traditional pub called New Moon. \"There are less people around on Fridays, but the pubs are always busy on a Thursday night.\"\n\nIt's a trend that Caroline has noticed, along with bartender Paolo, who's worked in Leadenhall Market for the past seven years.\n\n\"It's more of a Tuesday to Thursday culture,\" Paolo said, in comparison to the glory days of five nights a week of City workers out for a drink.\n\nIf Leadenhall Market is any bellwether of London as a whole, it would be premature to say nightlife is marching toward its own death. But, thanks in part to Gen Z and changing work habits overall, it does seem to be transforming.\n\nThe sacred London after-work pint is safe, for now.",

    "title": "3 people who pivoted into AI share how they used their college experience to break into the field",
    "description": "Three AI engineers explain how returning to school, internships, and college relationships led to jobs at startups and major tech companies.",
    "fullText": "AI has become one of the most popular fields in tech. The people working in it didn't all follow the same path to get there, but for some, college played a crucial role in their success.\n\nFor one AI startup engineer, returning to school provided an opportunity to explore what an AI career would be like before committing to it. For another, moving to the US for a graduate program opened doors to being closer to the center of the action in Big Tech. In another case, relationships formed during college — with peers, professors, and mentors — continued to shape his career even long after graduation.\n\nBelow are three people who pivoted into AI roles and shared with Business Insider how they leveraged their college experience to break into the field. Quotes have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nVarun Goyal is a 25-year-old AI startup engineer, based in California.\n\nIn my final year of undergraduate studies, I stood at a crossroads between quantitative trading and pursuing a career in technology. Blinded by the initial high salary and prestige, I joined a firm in India as a quantitative strategist for the summer.\n\nI enjoyed it, but I wanted to push boundaries in my career and was increasingly convinced that I should return to school to explore more options. I decided to move from India to the US for my master's degree in computer science.\n\nReturning to school gave me the opportunity to pursue research and engage with senior industry professionals in both fields. This was the biggest benefit for me when I was deciding what I wanted my daily life and career to look like in 10 years.\n\nIn graduate school, the AI boom was also happening. It kept me up at night in the best way possible. I ultimately applied to both industries and had a few quant interviews, but I decided to join an AI startup in 2024 after graduating. I took a lower base salary than what I would have earned in quant, but I felt AI gave me more options down the line.\n\nWithout going back for my master's, I wouldn't have had this opportunity, and I love working in AI.\n\nDeep Shah is a 30-year-old software engineer at Google, based in Mountain View, CA.\n\nGrowing up, I wanted to develop my own computer games, which was the primary reason I chose to pursue a career in computer engineering. I also learned through conversations with peers older than me that the field involved a lot of automating machines to work on my behalf, which excited me. This was my first experience with mentorship.\n\nWhen I was pursuing my bachelor's degree, I got involved with professors who believed in and supported me. Having someone expose me to machine learning or AI problems they're excited about, no matter how small or large, taught me skills that are rarely learned just by doing the core work.\n\nEach mentor will teach you different things, and the person doesn't necessarily need to be a professor. They could be an alum or someone who's more senior at your college. Working with a mentor is also a valuable addition to your résumé, demonstrating that you already possess the skills and experience necessary to succeed in a professional environment.\n\nLater in my career, leaning on peers and mentors provided me with opportunities to further advance my career at Google. I joined Google Bangalore in 2018 after speaking with a friend who worked there. He helped me decide the role I was applying for could be the right fit for me.\n\nIn 2021, I was still at Google Bangalore and wanted to contribute to improving the user experience on Google search. The team working on that project was based in Mountain View, CA, and my skill set was a very good match, so I decided to relocate to the US to join that team.\n\nBuilding my networking skills with peers and mentors throughout my education directly contributed to my later success at Google.\n\nKriti Goyal is a 28-year-old AI machine learning engineer at a Big Tech company, based in Seattle.\n\nI always thought I would study medicine until my cousin showed me a Code.org video with Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and other tech rockstars, about how coding is the quickest way to convert an idea into a product. That changed my life.\n\nI'm now part of the Foundation Model main framework team for a major Big Tech company in the US. This year, I completed five years with them, during which time I've held four different roles. I used my master's to move to the US and further my career.\n\nI originally interned at my current company in India. I enjoyed working in India, but the core business decisions and strategizing for the next projects were made at the company headquarters here in the US.\n\nI had two ways to go about moving to the US. One was to try to move within my company or pursue a master's degree. Two reasons I chose the master's path are the knowledge and extra specialty you can develop through projects, as well as the connections you make. The biggest thing I took away from my program was the people I met.\n\nWhen I arrived in the US, I knew a few people from my former company from my time in India, so I reached out to them directly instead of applying through the job board. I got the interview for a machine learning engineering internship quite easily because the company was already familiar with my work.\n\nLearning and networking can be done in many places; it doesn't have to be university. In a city like San Francisco or New York, you could hustle and get the networking benefits of a university and a structured system.\n\nI think it's now possible to skip that education stage. But I have seen a bias in hiring for specific teams, and it's not unbreakable yet. I was changing countries and cultures, and university was a great way to get through the immigration system and understand the culture. I needed it, and I feel fortunate to be where I am in my career because I made the decision to pursue my master's degree.\n\nDo you have a story to share about breaking into the AI field?

    "description": "Blackstone valued its real estate portfolio, which includes vacation destinations across the globe, at $611 billion.",
    "fullText": "A vacation destination nestled off the coast of Australia will soon be owned by Blackstone, the US-based investment firm.\n\nBlackstone announced on December 23 that it entered an agreement to acquire Hamilton Island. Outlets, including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, said the deal is worth $1.2 billion.\n\n\"This investment, which is subject to customary regulatory approvals, builds on Blackstone's leading global position in leisure and hospitality, including in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, where it has made significant investments across Australia, Japan, and India,\" Blackstone said in a press release.\n\nBlackstone valued its real estate portfolio, which includes numerous vacation destinations worldwide, at $611 billion as of September 2025.\n\nHere is what Blackstone is getting with its latest purchase.\n\nHamilton Island is part of the Whitsunday Islands chain in Queensland, located off the northeast coast of Australia. The Ngaro people originally lived on the Whitsunday Islands, which are near the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nTourists from Australia's outback and southern region began vacationing at Hamilton Island in the 1920s, according to the Hamilton Island tourism website.\n\nHamilton Island transformed into a resort destination in the 1980s under Keith Williams, who owned and operated the island for two decades, according to the tourism website.\n\nDuring that time, he built Hamilton Island's marina and a resort. The island was later acquired by the family of Bob Oatley, a famous Australian winemaker.\n\nThe Hamilton Island tourism website said the Oatley family spends millions of dollars each year on upgrading the infrastructure, accommodations, and services.\n\nHamilton Island measures 2,800 acres across two islands. There are five hotels, 20 retailers, over 20 restaurants and bars, a marina, a golf course, and a commercial airport.\n\nAbout 70% of the area remains undeveloped, Blackstone said.\n\nHamilton Island is located near the Great Barrier Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. As a result, significant efforts are made to preserve the area.\n\nIn addition to sustainable waste disposal, the tourism site said the island has nature-based experiences to educate guests, island-wide erosion and sediment control measures, water treatment plans, liquid composters, and more.\n\nHamilton Island has a range of activities for guests, including ATV riding for children, snorkeling, mountain biking, a golf club, a yacht club, and more.\n\nHamilton Island's position near the Coral Sea makes it an ideal destination for sailing, a popular activity among visitors. In addition to the marina and local yacht club, Hamilton Island has hosted an annual sailing race week for four decades.\n\nThe next race week is scheduled for August 2026.\n\nNearly two decades ago, Queensland's tourism office launched a campaign encouraging people to apply for the \"Best Job in the World\": a six-month stint as a caretaker on Hamilton Island.\n\nQueensland's tourism website said the winner, Ben Southall, beat out over 34,000 applicants from over 200 countries. The BBC reported that the position came with a $150,000 salary and a luxury villa for accommodation.",

    "description": "Even though April is a long way off, it's a good idea to start planning now on how to reduce your tax bill.",
    "fullText": "You don't normally associate the time of Christmas cookies and New Year's bubbly with tax season. But even though April is a long way off, it's a good idea to start planning now on how to reduce your tax bill.\n\nIf you own stocks or other assets, one simple way to cut down your taxable income is a strategy known as tax-loss harvesting. Essentially, you sell any assets that have lost value since you bought them, locking in the capital loss. The deadline to be able to claim these losses for next year's taxes is December 31, giving you today, tomorrow, and Wednesday to sell.\n\nThere are two main ways you can use the strategy to reduce your taxes. One, you can use the losses to offset any capital gains you locked in this year. And two, you can use capital losses to offset regular W-2 income by up to $3,000.\n\nIf you use the strategy, keep in mind the wash-sale rule. This stipulates that you can't buy the same asset, or something \"substantially identical,\" in the 30-day period before and after selling for a loss. But in that window, you're allowed to move your money into an asset that is different enough from the asset you're selling.\n\nWhat constitutes an asset that is different enough is up to the interpretation of the IRS, but an obvious example that probably wouldn't fly is starting a position in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) right before or after selling shares of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) at a loss.\n\nOne candidate for tax-loss harvesting this year is crypto. The digital assets suffered big losses in 2025. While bitcoin and ethereum are down 6% and 12% year-to-date, respectively, if you bought at their October 7 highs, you'd be down 29% and 37%.\n\nOther assets that have had a rough go of it recently include shares of Coreweave (CRWV) and Oracle (ORCL), which have fallen 45% and 39% from recent highs, respectively. But it all depends on when you bought in.\n\nThe strategy isn't necessarily for everyone. If you plan on holding your assets for a long time, it may be best not to sell, as you could miss potential upside in the near term.\n\nUltimately, it is recommended that you consult a financial advisor. But if your investing journey didn't go quite according to plan in 2025, tax-loss harvesting could be one way to turn a negative into a positive as we head into the new year.",

    "description": "TikTok jumped into the top spot among social apps where young people regularly get news, according to data from the Pew Research Center.",
    "fullText": "TikTok has unseated its social media rivals as the top spot for young people to get their news.\n\nTikTok is now the most popular social app for news among 18- to 29-year-olds in the US, according to new survey data from the Pew Research Center. The app surpassed YouTube and Instagram, which were the top choices in 2024.\n\nForty-three percent of young adults said they regularly get news from TikTok in 2025, compared to 41% for both YouTube and Facebook. Forty percent named Instagram as a regular news source, while 21% said X (formerly Twitter) and 18% said Reddit.\n\nSocial media beat out every other format as a place where 18- to 29-year-olds said they get news, according to Pew's survey. Seventy-six percent of the cohort said they often or sometimes get news from social media, compared to 60% for news websites and 28% for email newsletters.\n\nHalf of the young adults who responded to Pew's survey said they have some or a lot of trust in social media as a news source. That roughly matched the level of trust the age group has for information from national news organizations.\n\nTikTok has been rising quickly as a go-to source for news. In 2023, 32% of respondents named the video app as a place for regular news consumption.\n\nWatching news on TikTok does not necessarily mean tuning into videos from traditional outlets like The Washington Post or NBC News. Young people view commentary from news influencers and user-generated videos tied to current events, such as from a war zone or protest, as news as well.\n\nA new crop of independent news influencers has emerged to report on current events, including creators like Philip DeFranco and Vitus \"V\" Spehar's @underthedesknews.\n\nSome professional news organizations, including NPR's \"Planet Money,\" have similarly centered videos on individual creators who can help build trust with their audiences. Gen Z social-media users told Business Insider that they are drawn to news creators who can deliver information in a more authentic and relatable manner.\n\nBeyond news commentary, social media creators and podcasters have taken on a bigger role in news gathering in recent months. Politicians and government institutions are turning to podcasts and other formats to reach people, and content creators had a big presence at national conventions for the Democrats and Republicans last year. Many independent creators have applied for access to White House press briefings in 2025.\n\nTikTok has introduced a handful of features tied to news on its app, including the ability for publishers to link to articles inside videos and a \"community notes\" style fact-checking tool called footnotes. It also works with \"independent fact-checkers in over 130 markets to determine if content is accurate,\" according to its website.",

He began his career as a researcher at IBM before joining Meta, where he advanced from researcher to manager in just three years, according to his LinkedIn profile. He then held director positions at Square and Snacphat, and was vice president of engineering at HubSpot, before he joined HeyGen, a visual storytelling platform, in 2024.\n\nOver the years, he said he has noticed that those he has mentored can make themselves miserable when they strive for a promotion.\n\n\"Don't do that,\" he said. \"When you start to get into that mindset, you start to count your happiness or your career growth toward something that you don't have full control over.\"\n\nIt's better to control the things you can control. \"Learn how to adjust, and you'll be a better self afterward,\" he said.\n\nFor those still determined to seek a promotion, however, timing matters.\n\nExecutive coach Andrea Wasserman previously told Business Insider that it's best to put yourself in your manager's shoes and think about what's happening across the team or company. Ask yourself, \"Will this timing make it easier or harder for me to get a 'yes?'\"",

    "description": "AI in the workplace may boost speed and efficiency, but risks eroding confidence and critical thinking, the CEO of a digital economy think tank said.",
    "fullText": "AI appears to be making workers faster, more efficient, and more productive on paper.\n\nHowever, according to Mehdi Paryavi, CEO of the International Data Center Authority, which advises companies and governments on building the data centers that power AI, it may also be quietly eroding workers' confidence in their job skills.\n\nParyavi told Buisness Insider that excessive and poorly designed AI use in workplaces is driving what he called a \"quiet cognitive erosion\" and \"down-skilling.\"\n\n\"There used to be a notion called 'thinking outside the box,'\" he said. \"That notion will soon cease to exist when everyone draws on all their creativity, analytics, and innovation from a single box called AI.\"\n\nParyavi believes the most immediate casualty of heavy AI reliance is self-belief.\n\n\"If you come to believe that AI writes better than you and thinks smarter than you, you will lose your own confidence in yourself,\" he said.\n\nParyavi said the loss of confidence compounds quickly as workers begin deferring writing, analysis, and judgment to AI systems, gradually relying less on the skills they have built through years of reading, writing, learning, and observation.\n\n\"All of a sudden, you realize you are not good enough without this new tool, and day by day, you rely less on yourself and more on AI,\" he said.\n\nResearch is beginning to reflect that pattern. A new report from the Work AI Institute, produced with researchers from universities including Notre Dame, Harvard, and UC Santa Barbara, found that AI is turning ordinary office workers into people who feel smarter and more productive while their underlying skills slowly erode.\n\nRebecca Hinds, head of the Work AI Institute, told Business Insider that AI creates an illusion of expertise, which is especially risky for early-career employees who still need to establish their foundations.\n\nMuch of the problem, Paryavi said, lies in how leaders define productivity.\n\nAI's biggest promise is speed — faster reports, faster launches, faster analysis. But faster doesn't always mean better, Paryavi said.\n\nWhile AI can generate professional-sounding output, Paryavi said it often lacks the depth that comes from years of hands-on expertise.\n\nThat loss of depth is already visible, according to Anastasia Berg, a philosophy professor at the University of California, Irvine, who has said that workers who rely heavily on AI risk rapid skill atrophy, especially junior employees who never fully learn how to think through problems independently.\n\nParyavi isn't opposed to AI. He said the risk comes from indiscriminate use.\n\nCompanies should tailor AI access by job function, he said, rather than rolling it out universally. Some roles may benefit heavily from AI support, while others should rely primarily on human judgment.\n\nHe also discussed the importance of human involvement at both ends of the workflow — leading creative thinking at the beginning and quality-checking AI output at the end.\n\n\"What's critical to note is that you, the human you, must quality check AI, not the other way around,\" he said.\n\nAI may not eliminate jobs outright. But without deliberate limits, Paryavi said, it could quietly erode the confidence and thinking skills that careers are built on.\n\n\"How much technology do we really need, and how far are we willing to push the envelope? How much is enough?\" he said.",

    "description": "Allocators and portfolio managers have fully embraced the SMA. The trend will only accelerate in 2026, insiders say.",
    "fullText": "Most viral trends have a short half-life. Labubus are destined to gather dust in closets, the \"6—7\" meme will become cringe the moment a critical mass of adults figures it out, and other fads from 2025 will similarly recede in favor of fresh cultural hype.\n\nOne of the biggest trends in the hedge-fund world, however, appears to be doing the opposite. Its popularity is surging heading into 2026, according to industry insiders.\n\nThe so-called separately managed account, or SMA, sounds stodgy and is by no means new. But this way of investing in top hedge-fund strategies and talent reached new heights in 2025 — and now, everyone wants a piece of the action.\n\nInvestors across the spectrum are competing to plow money into promising hedge funds through SMAs, while a growing number of portfolio managers are emerging to grab the cash.\n\nA quick refresher: Traditionally, hedge funds raise capital by securing a group of investors, or limited partners, into a single commingled pool of money. That capital is then deployed across long-short equity, merger arbitrage, distressed credit, or myriad other strategies. Allocators receive periodic performance updates but have limited visibility into day-to-day positions, and their money is typically locked up to avoid panicked withdrawals during market stress.\n\nWith a managed account — which has existed for decades but gained traction in the 2010s after the financial crisis and Bernie Madoff debacle — investors get white-glove treatment. Their money may be deployed in similar strategies, but it's handled separately, with daily transparency into trades and positions and often the ability to redeem on short notice.\n\nIt's a bit like flying via private jet versus commercial: The destination is ultimately the same, but with a different level of service, control, and prestige.\n\nHistorically, most hedge-fund managers avoided SMAs. They added operational complexity and carried a stigma — a perception that a manager offering one couldn't raise a traditional fund.\n\nThat has all changed dramatically in recent years.\n\n\"There's no negative connotation around offering an SMA now. It's almost mandatory,\" Jon Caplis, CEO of hedge fund research firm PivotalPath, told Business Insider.\n\nOverall, SMA capital grew 27% in 2024 to $315 billion, according to Goldman Sachs research, and it has continued to climb since.\n\nInnocap, one of the largest providers of managed-account services to institutional allocators, sold minority equity stakes this year to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Bain Capital. Assets on its platform climbed from about $85 billion in April to more than $100 billion six months later.\n\nOne major growth driver in recent years has been the end of the era of zero-interest rates. Another seductive feature of the SMA structure, especially when interest rates are rising and cash earns higher returns, is that it allows investors to size up exposure to hedge fund strategies directly using borrowed money, preserving cash for other uses — or \"capital efficiency\" in industry speak.\n\nThe trend has been supercharged by the embrace of large multistrategy, multimanager hedge funds. These firms have amassed hundreds of billions of dollars — and are locked in a fierce battle for the top investment talent to deploy it.\n\nAs another way to gain exposure to elite traders, multimanagers have increasingly allocated capital to external portfolio managers through SMAs. By mid-2025, nearly 75% of multimanagers had backed an external PM, up from 54% in 2022, according to Goldman Sachs. Two-thirds of those allocations have come since 2024, and 90% since 2022 — almost exclusively via SMAs.\n\nActivity midway through 2025 was on pace to eclipse 2024 levels, Goldman said.\n\nWhile emerging managers and smaller funds account for much of the uptick in SMAs, established managers are also increasingly opening up to the SMA, according to a banker who advises hedge funds, who told Business Insider.\n\n\"Most new launch portfolio managers, their dream is to have a multi-billion-dollar commingled fund one day,\" said Jorge Hendrickson, cohead of prime services at Jones Trading, which provides hedge-fund services. \"But then, as they have investor conversations, depending on strategy, they start to realize a lot of the capital most readily available is actually from the SMA allocators.\"\n\nTom Bradbeer, who leads the hedge fund practice at search firm Maven Partnership, said the PMs they work with are increasingly asking about — and pursuing — SMAs. The emergence of more service providers and off-the-shelf products — access to data, trading infrastructure, risk systems, compliance, or back office — has made the transition easier than ever, he added.\n\n\"The barrier to entry is a lot lower,\" Bradbeer said.\n\nMomentum is only building as we head into 2026. Multimanagers have signaled plans to increase their external allocations next year, the banker said, while traditional allocators leaning into SMAs are adding more fuel to the fire.\n\nSeveral large banks are also prepping funds to allocate to external PMs, according to With Intelligence's 2026 Hedge Fund Outlook report.\n\n\"It's just accelerated. And we're far from it slowing down,\" one hedge fund allocator, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly, told Business Insider. \"Peers that haven't historically are now dabbling in it.\"\n\nAs SMA capital floods the market, the balance of power is shifting.\n\nWith more allocators competing for deals, emerging managers are becoming choosier — and increasingly reluctant to accept exclusive SMA arrangements, industry insiders said.\n\nAllocators, in turn, are pitching PMs on more than just capital.\n\n\"It's not just 'hey we'll give you capital' but 'here's ours and why you should take it versus others,'\" said one hedge fund exec, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly.\n\nPMs considering SMA-backed launches are also becoming savvier, insiders said, pressing harder on terms related to liquidity, exclusivity, and transparency.\n\nThose concerns were highlighted in a March paper from quant hedge fund Squarepoint, which has invested internal capital in external strategies via SMAs since 2018. The firm cautioned that some allocators may misuse SMA transparency by making parallel trades or replicating strategies internally — a practice it refers to as \"shadow alpha.\"\n\nSuch behavior can siphon profits from the SMA manager or erode the strategy's alpha, Squarepoint wrote, harming not only the PM but their other investors as well.\n\nSquarepoint — which typically makes nonexclusive investments — urged PMs to establish guardrails in their agreements and to ask probing questions before signing on with an allocator.\n\n\"The main point is just making sure that we're all on a level playing field,\" Nicolas Janson, head of external strategies at the fund, told Business Insider. \"Essentially, it's know your allocator.\"\n\nJanson said Squarepoint received positive responses to the paper, including direct action from some emerging managers.\n\n\"What we're hoping is that the industry as a whole starts to speak more about it and that the SMA business gradually evolves until shadow alphas are no longer,\" Janson said.\n\nAnother challenge emerging managers will face in 2026 is the talent war. Many of the same multimanagers seeding PMs through SMAs are also expanding aggressively — making it harder for startup funds to recruit analysts, researchers, and technologists.\n\n\"With the scrap for talent among multimanagers, it makes it incredibly hard for the smaller emerging funds to compete,\" Bradbeer said, adding that candidates considering joining such operations face significant career disruption if it doesn't pan out.",

Trump noted that the monthslong U.S.-led negotiations could still collapse.\n\n“Without security guarantees, realistically, this war will not end,” Zelenskyy told reporters in voice messages responding to questions sent via a Whatsapp chat.\n\nUkraine has been fighting Russia since 2014, when it illegally annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists took up arms in the Donbas, a vital industrial region in eastern Ukraine.\n\nDetails of the security guarantees have not become public but Zelenskyy said Monday that they include how a peace deal would be monitored as well as the “presence” of partners. He didn’t elaborate, but Russia has said it won’t accept the deployment in Ukraine of troops from NATO countries.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump were expected to speak in the near future but there was no indication the Russian leader would speak to Zelenskyy.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Kyiv’s allies will meet in Paris in early January to “finalize each country’s concrete contributions” to the security guarantees.\n\nTrump said he would consider extending U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine beyond 15 years, according to Zelenskyy. The guarantees would be approved by the U.S. Congress as well as by parliaments in other countries involved in overseeing any settlement, he said.\n\nZelenskyy said he wants the 20-point peace plan under discussion to be approved by Ukrainians in a national referendum.\n\nHowever, holding a ballot requires a ceasefire of at least 60 days, and Moscow has shown no willingness for a truce without a full settlement.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "KISKUNMAJSA, Hungary (AP) — Oszkár Nagyapáti climbed to the bottom of a sandy pit on his land on the Great Hungarian Plain and dug into the soil with his hand, looking for a sign of groundwater that in recent years has been in accelerating retreat.\n\n“It’s much worse, and it’s getting worse year after year,” he said as cloudy liquid slowly seeped into the hole. ”Where did so much water go? It’s unbelievable.”\n\nNagyapáti has watched with distress as the region in southern Hungary, once an important site for agriculture, has become increasingly parched and dry. Where a variety of crops and grasses once filled the fields, today there are wide cracks in the soil and growing sand dunes more reminiscent of the Sahara Desert than Central Europe.\n\nThe region, known as the Homokhátság, has been described by some studies as semiarid — a distinction more common in parts of Africa, the American Southwest or Australian Outback — and is characterized by very little rain, dried-out wells and a water table plunging ever deeper underground.\n\nIn a 2017 paper in European Countryside, a scientific journal, researchers cited “the combined effect of climatic changes, improper land use and inappropriate environmental management” as causes for the Homokhátság's aridification, a phenomenon the paper called unique in this part of the continent.\n\nFields that in previous centuries would be regularly flooded by the Danube and Tisza Rivers have, through a combination of climate change-related droughts and poor water retention practices, become nearly unsuitable for crops and wildlife.\n\nNow a group of farmers and other volunteers, led by Nagyapáti, are trying to save the region and their lands from total desiccation using a resource for which Hungary is famous: thermal water.\n\n“I was thinking about what could be done, how could we bring the water back or somehow create water in the landscape,\" Nagyapáti told The Associated Press. \"There was a point when I felt that enough is enough. We really have to put an end to this. And that's where we started our project to flood some areas to keep the water in the plain.”\n\nAlong with the group of volunteer “water guardians,” Nagyapáti began negotiating with authorities and a local thermal spa last year, hoping to redirect the spa's overflow water — which would usually pour unused into a canal — onto their lands. The thermal water is drawn from very deep underground.\n\nAccording to the water guardians' plan, the water, cooled and purified, would be used to flood a 2½-hectare (6-acre) low-lying field — a way of mimicking the natural cycle of flooding that channelizing the rivers had ended.\n\n“When the flooding is complete and the water recedes, there will be 2½ hectares of water surface in this area,\" Nagyapáti said. \"This will be quite a shocking sight in our dry region.”\n\nA 2024 study by Hungary’s Eötvös Loránd University showed that unusually dry layers of surface-level air in the region had prevented any arriving storm fronts from producing precipitation. Instead, the fronts would pass through without rain, and result in high winds that dried out the topsoil even further.\n\nThe water guardians hoped that by artificially flooding certain areas, they wouldn't only raise the groundwater level but also create a microclimate through surface evaporation that could increase humidity, reduce temperatures and dust and have a positive impact on nearby vegetation.\n\nTamás Tóth, a meteorologist in Hungary, said that because of the potential impact such wetlands can have on the surrounding climate, water retention “is simply the key issue in the coming years and for generations to come, because climate change does not seem to stop.”\n\n\"The atmosphere continues to warm up, and with it the distribution of precipitation, both seasonal and annual, has become very hectic, and is expected to become even more hectic in the future,” he said.\n\nFollowing another hot, dry summer this year, the water guardians blocked a series of sluices along a canal, and the repurposed water from the spa began slowly gathering in the low-lying field.\n\nAfter a couple of months, the field had nearly been filled. Standing beside the area in early December, Nagyapáti said that the shallow marsh that had formed \"may seem very small to look at it, but it brings us immense happiness here in the desert.”\n\nHe said the added water will have a “huge impact” within a roughly 4-kilometer (2½-mile) radius, \"not only on the vegetation, but also on the water balance of the soil. We hope that the groundwater level will also rise.”\n\nPersistent droughts in the Great Hungarian Plain have threatened desertification, a process where vegetation recedes because of high heat and low rainfall. Weather-damaged crops have dealt significant blows to the country’s overall gross domestic product, prompting Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to announce this year the creation of a “drought task force” to deal with the problem.\n\nAfter the water guardians' first attempt to mitigate the growing problem in their area, they said they experienced noticeable improvements in the groundwater level, as well as an increase of flora and fauna near the flood site.\n\nThe group, which has grown to more than 30 volunteers, would like to expand the project to include another flooded field, and hopes their efforts could inspire similar action by others to conserve the most precious resource.\n\n“This initiative can serve as an example for everyone, we need more and more efforts like this,\" Nagyapáti said. \"We retained water from the spa, but retaining any kind of water, whether in a village or a town, is a tremendous opportunity for water replenishment.”\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "fullText": "Every new year brings great expectations and hopes for boxing fans.\n\nWill we see the biggest fights? Are we finally going to get Anthony Joshua v Tyson Fury? Who will emerge as the next big star?\n\nHere BBC Sport picks out some bouts we want to see in 2026.\n\nRight it's the big one and the serial heartbreaker – Joshua v Fury.\n\nWe've come close before, several times, but this time we are filled with renewed optimism the heavyweight super-fight will happen.\n\nForget the fact neither man is world champion or that Fury, 37, has been retired for a year, or the fight is a few years late with Joshua now 36, we'd still really like to see it.\n\nIt would be a seminal moment for the two best British heavyweights of their era to face each other.\n\nAnd if it does happen, we expect it to be in the UK at the end of 2026.\n\nLightweight world champion Caroline Dubois is quickly emerging as the next major talent. Now aligned with Jake Paul's Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), she made her promotional debut in December with an impressive win against Camilla Panatta.\n\nSurely unification fights are next for the 24-year-old and who is a better option than fellow Briton and WBO belt holder Terri Harper?\n\nThe pair don't seem to be the biggest fans of each other but now they're under the same promotional banner.\n\nBoth fight at pace and it has all the makings of a British boxing classic - never mind the fact they're both world champions.\n\nUnified super-featherweight Alycia Baumgardner is also an intriguing and fun option for either woman, although the 31-year-old American beat Harper in a title bout back in 2021.\n\nLight-welterweight Adam Azim will be in action live on BBC Two against Argentine Gustavo Daniel Lemos on 31 January, but it really is just about time for the unbeaten 23-year-old Briton to make a big step up.\n\nSheffield's Dalton Smith is a brilliant fight for Azim. The 28-year-old challenges for a world title on 10 January against Subriel Matias.\n\nShould Smith win, Slough-born Azim could face him in a world championship contest, but defeat would make it a massive must-win all-British encounter.\n\nThis is the fight for the boxing purists. Former bantamweight world champion Junto Nakatani's move to super-bantamweight in December was basically to pave the way for an all-Japanese world title super-fight with Naoya Inoue.\n\nMultiple world champion Inoue, 32, is widely considered the standout fighter in any weight division. No-one has got close to 'The Monster', but perhaps the 27-year-old Nakatani will be the man to do it.\n\nBoth are unbeaten, with 51 knockouts between them, and it could be a fight for the ages.\n\nWe were expecting this fight to happen in 2025, but boxing politics appeared to get in the way.\n\nLauren Price, 31, has been impeccable since turning professional and is already a unified champion at welterweight after just nine fights.\n\nThe only belt she doesn't have, Mikaela Mayer does. Unable to defend that WBO title against Price, Mayer casually jumped up to light-middleweight to become a three-weight world champion.\n\nMayer's success adds to the intrigue of a showdown with Price and the outspoken American, 35, may produce some verbal fireworks from the usually calm Welsh boxer.\n\nFabio Wardley is living the dream as a white-collar boxer turned heavyweight world champion.\n\nThe 31-year-old will be expected to have a low-risk first defence of his WBO title, but we'd really love to see the big-hitting Ipswich man in the ring with the division's brightest prospect in 20-year-old Moses Itauma.\n\nThey are likely to be two of the biggest figures in British boxing over the next five years and seem certain to meet at some stage.\n\nWhy not now, when Wardley has a world title to his name?\n\nConor Benn v Ryan Garcia or Lewis Crocker\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

All three were in England's first-choice XI for the first Test in Perth.\n\nWood has not played since Perth because of a knee issue, while Archer was ruled out after three Tests because of a side strain.\n\nSurrey's Atkinson struggled in the first two Tests, managing only three wickets, and was subsequently left out of the third.\n\nThe 27-year-old looked nearer his best when he was recalled for the fourth Test, taking three wickets and making 28 with the bat in England's first innings.\n\nHe grabbed his left hamstring at the end of the fourth over of his spell on the second morning and immediately left the field. Atkinson played no further part as England completed a four-wicket win later the same day.\n\nThere is no confirmation on when he will return to the UK, at which point he will be assessed further. Earlier this year Atkinson spent two months out with an injury to his right hamstring.\n\nAtkinson's absence leaves Durham's Potts in line to add his to his 10 Test caps and make an Ashes debut.\n\nThe 27-year-old has not played a Test match since the defeat by New Zealand in Hamilton last December.\n\nA regular in the first summer of the Ben Stokes-Brendon McCullum era, Potts has made sporadic appearances over the past two years.

    "fullText": "Australia's unbeaten run at home in Ashes Tests was always going to end one day.\n\nThat it concluded at 18 matches with England's win in Melbourne was obviously disappointing for us Australians in the commentary boxes but not devastating.\n\nThat run had gone on for almost 15 years and I still cannot work out how England have managed to lose 16 out of 18 before this.\n\nThey have had good players across that period – Joe Root, Ben Stokes, James Anderson, Stuart Broad and others – so it has to be the mental and tactical side of the game, as I suggested last week.\n\nHaving come through that, we will see if that is the curse broken or if England slip back into their old ways in Sydney where hopefully there will be a pitch that allows for a more even contest between bat and ball.",

    "fullText": "As the Women’s Super League enjoys its last bit of rest before the January transfer window and the second half of the season, The Athletic takes a look back at what stood out in European women’s football in 2025.\n\nIt was a year of the unlikely, with Arsenal overcoming the odds to upset three-time Champions League winners Barcelona. Even if the magic didn’t last, the feat was something to behold in May.\n\nAnd although the Lionesses were the European Championship holders, a misstep against France in their opening game added some drama to an eventual final win, another England vs Spain showdown.\n\nCharlotte Harpur and Michael Cox reflect on the moments that stuck with them after another monumental year for women’s football in Europe.\n\nThe achievement is remarkable in itself but the way it was done will go down in history. Unlike Euro 2022, it was not a smooth ride for the Lionesses. Player retirements and withdrawals weeks before the tournament threatened to rock the boat, before an opening 2-1 defeat to France put their backs against the wall. Somehow, England found a way in every knockout game, even when they looked down and out.\n\nBlackburn Rovers’ financial troubles\n\nIt was a stark reminder of the fragility of women’s football. Blackburn Rovers’ owner, V H Group, decided not to fulfil the required licensing criteria to stay in Women’s Super League 2, English football’s second division.\n\nBlackburn, who helped produce England stars Georgia Stanway, Ella Toone and Keira Walsh, were demoted and now compete in the regional fourth tier.\n\nThe Athletic reported in June that the proposed redundancies could impact at least 20 members of staff and all senior players were due to be released upon the expiry of their contracts that summer.\n\nWomen’s Euros quarter-final: France vs Germany\n\nThe excitement before Germany versus France was helped by the fitting location of Basel, which is within walking distance of both countries’ borders. But the game seemed to be dead within 12 minutes, when Germany centre-back Kathrin Hendrich was sent off for foolishly pulling Griedge Mbock Bathy’s hair inside the box. Grace Geyoro converted from the spot and then it was 1-0, 11 versus 10 — surely no way back for Germany.\n\nYet somehow, they stayed in it. Sjoeke Nusken headed home an unlikely equaliser from a corner and France had two goals disallowed for offside. Germany, who had barely crossed the halfway line for much of the game, won a penalty out of nothing. Nusken stepped up but saw her spot kick saved by Pauline Peyraud-Magnin. Germany had surely blown their chance.\n\nThen came the most memorable moment, when Sakina Karchaoui’s cross into the box was inadvertently flicked on by Nusken towards her own goal, looping over the seemingly helpless Ann-Katrin Berger. It seemed a certain goal, only for Germany’s goalkeeper to backpedal, dive vertically backwards and claw the ball away. It was a truly remarkable save. Germany had somehow made it to extra time.\n\nThey were on the back foot throughout the half-hour period, which ended when France’s Melvine Malard thumped the bar from 30 yards in the final minute. By that point, you knew it was Germany’s day. Berger didn’t just save two penalties, but she also scored one herself. For sheer drama, it was as good as football gets.\n\nSpain and Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmati won the Ballon d’Or and the award for Euro 2025’s best player, but in truth, she wasn’t at her best in a year when she was affected by injury and illness. Her team-mate, Alexia Putellas, was magnificent in the group stage in Switzerland but faded in the knockout matches.\n\nInstead, this was the year when their midfield colleague for club and country, Patri Guijarro, stamped her mark on matches at the highest level. A consistent but underrated performer for Barcelona, she was absent from Spain’s World Cup success in 2023 but was their standout performer at Euro 2025, setting the tone for Spain’s possession play with incisive passes from deep, making sudden forward runs to catch out opponents who don’t expect a holding midfielder to be popping up in attack, and charging forward to press on the edge of the opposition box. Her performances for Barcelona have also been exceptional.\n\n“Playing with her is very easy and very difficult at the same time,” said her team-mate Vicky Lopez. “There are passes that only she sees and you don’t expect. You have to get used to her.”\n\nFor all the discussion that some of the outsiders are catching up with the traditional powers, there remains an obvious ‘big six’ in European international football: England, France, Spain, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands. And the simple reality is that they don’t lose to the other nations. Those big six won all 10 games against the other teams at Euro 2025. Include Euro 2022, and you can extend that to winning 26 of 27 matches played — and the exception was Iceland snatching a last-minute draw against a France side who were already assured of top spot in their group.\n\nEverything revolves around this, and all the narratives we create are largely about the draw. Italy reached the semi-finals largely because they avoided a big-six team in the quarter-finals. The Netherlands crashed out early because they were in a group with England and France.\n\nChelsea manager Sonia Bompastor did not mince her words. She came out punching, defending her goalkeeper Hannah Hampton and England manager Sarina Wiegman following former England No 1 Mary Earps’ comments in her book about the events that led to her international retirement before the 2025 Euros.\n\n“With what I read in terms of the comments coming from Mary Earps, it’s not acceptable to not show respect to your team-mates or managers,” she said after Chelsea beat London City Lionesses 2-0 in November.\n\n“We are talking about Hannah, but I want to raise my voice for Sarina. When you use some words about someone who won the Euros three times in a row, you should probably think about it before you speak.\n\n“If you look at what Hannah said in her previous comments about Mary Earps, then what Mary is saying about her now — one of them is class, and Hannah is the class one.”\n\nArsenal were the clear underdogs heading into the Champions League final. It was almost David against Goliath and very few thought they could dethrone three-time winners Barcelona from their lofty perch in Lisbon.\n\nAlmost everything about the win seemed unlikely. Head coach Renee Slegers had been an assistant at the start of the season, and was only appointed permanently after a three-month interim spell. Chloe Kelly, who played on the right wing, had been a surprise loan signing on January deadline day. Stina Blackstenius was being mocked for missing easy chances, yet scored the winning goal.\n\nSomehow, everything came together in Lisbon: Slegers’ game plan, Arsenal’s discipline out wide, and Blackstenius’ winner. Unfortunately for the club, the smooth sailing didn’t last the year.\n\nIf you haven’t been watching Dumornay, where have you been? Now in her third season at OL Lyonnes, the 22-year-old punished Manchester United and Arsenal in the Champions League with ruthless efficiency, scoring a brace in each. On more than one occasion, she created space for herself with fluid footwork and unleashed a rocket. In France’s Division 1, she is the league’s top contributor for goal and shot-creating actions.\n\nThe attacking midfielder was one to watch at the 2023 World Cup with Haiti and she is set to tear it up on the European stage.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nEngland, Women's Soccer, Women's Euros\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

It’s been a long wait until Sunday to find out if the Philadelphia Eagles will have anything to play for in Week 18 when they host the Commanders for the season finale. The Eagles squeaked out a win in Buffalo when the Bills went for two, instead of attempting the extra point to take the game into overtime. Philly still has a shot to move up to the #2 seed in the NFC.\n\nThe Washington Commanders are currently sitting in the No. 7 overall spot in next year’s draft, and they can’t drop any lower than that. They can move up with help from other teams. QB Marcus Mariota had stitches in his throwing hand last week and didn’t play on Christmas day, and he was listed as day-to-day. Washington also has other players who are dealing with injuries that could be shut down for the season finale. Will the Eagles play their starters, or do they even need to for this sad finale to a lost season?\n\nJoin our partner FanDuel for all your betting needs\n\nOpening odds for the Commanders have them as 7.5-point home underdogs against the Eagles.

The money was great, but being able to be the inaugural champions you couldn’t ask for anything more. Bringing home that trophy was the best thing.”\n\nThe entire event took roughly a week, with the team first having to beat out other teams in their group stage. Once they qualified for the main field, they put their skills into overdrive and advanced all the way to the championship match, which pitted them against a team from St. Louis. Thus, making it a true, Show-Me State showdown.\n\n“Ultimately, going into it as amateurs, you never expect to win a national championship,” said Gene Wineland. “So it was exciting all the way.”\n\n“To have an all-Missouri final I think it puts Missouri on the map and it shows we have true pool players and competitors in the sport,” Whaley said. “And I think the world knows that now.”\n\nFor Kyle Burne, the thrill of winning the first-of-its-kind tournament was sureal, but so was being able to watch and learn from the sport’s top players.\n\n“There were tons of pros there,” said Kyle Burne. “That was really exciting for me. Getting to see my idol, Shane Van Boening. A lot of the pros that were there, they were taking a lot of the amateur players, like myself, under their wing.”\n\nWhile each member of 8 Runners Southbound played their part to contribute to the win, Robert Conrad walked away with extra bragging rights, over his teammates, since he also won a singles national championship at the event.\n\n“I didn’t go into this thinking it was ever going to happen,” said Robert Conrad. “I was gonna be happy just to participate. But being a two-time national champion, the funnest thing for me is being able to put my name into Google, do an AI search and find out about myself.”",

    "fullText": "With the San Francisco 49ers beating the Chicago Bears on Sunday Night Football, the Los Angeles Rams have officially been eliminated from contention for winning the NFC West division. The Rams will either be the 5-seed or the 6-seed, and historically those kind of differences have meant little or nothing to head coach Sean McVay. Without anything else on the line, should McVay start resting starters like Matthew Stafford and Puka Nacua as early as Monday night against the Atlanta Falcons?\n\nThat’s a question that will linger on the Rams until Monday night, but the consequences of playing starters and one of them being injured is something that could haunt McVay if he doesn’t play the safe route. McVay almost always chooses the safe route with starters.\n\nIf 49ers and Seahawks both win this weekend, Rams can’t win division. Curious what McVay would do Week 18 vs Arizona. He historically has usually rested his starters without regard for basic seeding differences but a win means at NFC South winner instead of likely at Philly.\n\n— Stuckey (@Stuckey2) December 26, 2025\n\nIf the Rams beat the Falcons on Monday and then the Arizona Cardinals next Sunday, it guarantees that L.A. will be the 5-seed and face the winner of the NFC South. That will be determined by who wins the Bucs-Panthers game next Saturday, unless the Falcons win their remaining two games, then Carolina is the division winner.\n\nOf course, if the Rams lose to the Falcons, it opens them up for the six-seed.\n\nIf the Rams lose to the Falcons and beat the Cardinals, plus the 49ers beat the Seahawks, then L.A. slips to the six-seed. That puts the Rams on the road and instead of facing the winner of the NFC South, they will face either the Eagles or the Bears; most likely the Eagles.\n\nIs it worth it to Sean McVay to risk the health of his starters to try and guarantee a wild card game in Tampa Bay or Carolina rather than having to go to Philadelphia or Chicago?\n\nThe Seahawks and 49ers face off for the NFC West title and number one seed on Saturday night.",

He wants you to give it everything you got each and every play, and it’s always going to come down to effort and finish with your teammates.”\n\nVrabel has done an outstanding job transforming the Patriots, who only won four games last season, into AFC East champions in his first year as head coach.\n\nThe Patriots will face the Miami Dolphins this Sunday, with a chance to secure the No. 1 seed in the AFC.

It was James throwing down a reverse dunk and offering words of wisdom to teammates.\n\nAnd it also was reserve Nick Smith Jr. finding a role in the rotation and producing, one of the six Lakers scoring in double figures. Smith had 21 points on eight-for-14 shooting, making five of 10 threes.\n\nRui Hachimura had 12 points, Deandre Ayton had 11 points and 11 rebounds, and Jake LaRavia had 11 points.\n\nThe Lakers (20-10) took control from the start of the third quarter, going on a 13-2 run to give them a 26-point lead that reached as high as 30 in the fourth quarter.\n\nGranted, the Kings (8-24) have the second-worst record in the West and were missing injured stars Zach LaVine, Domantas Sabonis and Keegan Bradley, three of their top four scorers.\n\nBut the Lakers lost three straight games because of poor defense and an overall effort that Redick described as \"terrible.\"\n\nAnd with Austin Reaves out for at least a month because of a calf strain, getting the chance to talk through their issues might end up changing the team's fortunes.\n\n\"They're trying, and you know, I told the guys, this is normal,\" Redick said. \"There's very few teams that don't hit troughs throughout the season. It's not all peaks. ... It's just a natural cycle that every team goes through.\n\n\"So we need to identify the problems and then come up with the solutions. So that's just the process that we're in the middle of right now.”\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "The Chicago Bears put up a good fight against the San Francisco 49ers in a prime-time shootout, but they fell short. We break it down.",
    "fullText": "Before the Chicago Bears could even take the field against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday night, they were declared the NFC North champions after the Green Bay Packers lost on Saturday night. Despite a tough 42-38 loss in prime-time, the Bears have locked down a home playoff game.\n\nThe Bears came into the weekend with a chance at being any of the top three seeds in the NFC. For this to be the first season under rookie head coach Ben Johnson, they’ve exceeded all expectations.\n\nThe 49ers are one of the teams competing for that top spot in the conference. It was a disastrous start for them and a perfect start for Chicago, however, as the first offensive play of the game was an interception returned for a touchdown by linebacker T.J. Edwards.\n\nFrom there, the teams exchanged touchdowns throughout. It is the first regular-season game in NFL history to be tied at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35. Tied up at 35, the Bears' defense got a stop for the first time in a while. The next offensive drive ended with just a field goal for the Bears, which was then answered by a 49ers touchdown to go up by four.\n\nWith 2:05 remaining in regulation time, quarterback Caleb Williams had another opportunity to create a game-winning drive for the Bears. Succeeding would've given Chicago a league-leading seven wins when trailing within the final two minutes of the fourth quarter. Although they had a chance, they ran out of time as they couldn't find the endzone on fourth-and-4 on the final play of the game.\n\nFor a young team, a rookie head coach, a second-year quarterback, and a roster loaded with injuries and illness, it was a valiant effort. They were not even supposed to be a playoff team this year, and they competed for the No. 1 seed in Week 17. They will be fine settling for the second or third seed as NFC North champions.\n\nAlthough the Bears' defense had a disastrous outing, this was a shootout from the beginning. The offense, which has tended to wait until the second half to play well, was incredible from the start.\n\nWilliams completed 25-of-42 passes for 330 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions or sacks. His top receiving target was receiver Luther Burden III, who had eight receptions for 138 yards and a score. Tight end Colston Loveland also deserves mention, as he had 94 yards on six receptions with a touchdown. The two rookies played incredibly and gave their quarterback a good target all game long.\n\nThe running game was solid. It wasn't as dominant as it normally is, but that is in part due to Williams picking apart the San Francisco defense. D'Andre Swift had nine carries for 54 yards, and two of those carries ended in the endzone. Rookie Kyle Monangai had 38 yards on eight carries.\n\nIn this game, Ben Johnson went against Kyle Shanahan. The latter has been one of the best offensive coaches in the NFL for a long time now, and Johnson is catching up quickly. They both deserve mentions in the \"Coach of the Year\" discussion, and they clearly have evenly matched teams coming out of this game.\n\nNext up for the Bears is their regular season finale against the Detroit Lions, who blew Chicago out in Week 2. Now, Detroit will pay a visit to Soldier Field. The Lions are eliminated from playoff contention, but they would love to make sure that the Bears end the season on a low note. Expect Chicago to prepare well ahead of a very important playoff dress rehearsal.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Bears vs. 49ers: Instant analysis from Chicago’s Week 17 loss",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Penn State Nittany Lions had their football season come to an end Saturday afternoon with a 22-10 win against the Clemson Tigersin the Pinstripe Bowl to finish a rollercoaster season at 7-6.\n\nSmith succeeded former Penn State coach James Franklin around midseason after Franklin's dismissal in State College resulted in failure to live up to their preseason College Football Playoff and national title expectations.\n\nSmith's coaching job may have been the most resilient of the entire season, having a chance to reflect on the experience before handing the keys to Matt Campbell.\n\n“We could have very well quit, but they didn’t,\" Smith said. \"They chose another path.\"\n\nSmith continued, as he held back tears both on TV and while speaking to reporters after the game.\n\n“I love this group,\" Smith said. \"They’re just a special group of guys. This is the greatest moment of my life.”\n\nSimply put, this was bigger than a singular win. This was a former player attempting to restore a program that needed a boost in the worst way.\n\n“I love Penn State,\" Smith said. \"I love football, and the game and Penn State have done amazing things for me and my family. I’m just thankful and grateful.”\n\nSmith says he has high hopes for Campbell to have immediate success as soon as next fall.\n\n“The communication has been terrific,” Smith said. “We’re just trying to piece together and retain roster and bring in new roster players. But he’s been very, very good. The guys that have come with him so far, they’ve been awesome, as well.”\n\nThere is still work to be done in Happy Valley, but if anything couldn't be clearer, the Nittany Lions are anything but irrelevant with Campbell now leading the way.",

Or maybe it’s about the Birds’ backups being able to beat Washington anyway.\n\nElsewhere of interest to the Eagles, the Chicago Bears are just 1.5-point home favorites against the Detroit Lions in Week 18. Surprised the Bears aren’t favored by more since they have motivation to win to secure the No. 2 seed and the Lions have already been eliminated from playoff contention. Seems like the odds-makers are expecting Dan Campbell’s team to put up a fight regardless.\n\nIf you parlay the Eagles’ moneyline and the Lions’ moneyline together, the odds for that scenario are +160. It’s not likely, no, but it’s hardly far-fetched.\n\nThe thinking here is the Eagles will be playing to win in Week 18. The Commanders might not merely lay down after not liking how Philly beat them in Week 16. But their effort might not matter much with Josh Johnson potentially starting at quarterback for them.\n\nI think the Eagles win and cover, perhaps even if Tanner McKee and the backups play most of the game.

    "description": "A blowout win that showed dominance, depth, and plenty of room to tighten things up as Gonzaga wins by 40 in Malibu.",
    "fullText": "Gonzaga opened West Coast Conference play Sunday night in Malibu by blowing the game open early and never letting it narrow. The 96-56 win over Pepperdine moves the Zags to 13-1 on the season and extended one of the longest win streaks in college basketball to 50-0 as the Waves kept searching for their first win over the Zags since 2002. The night nudged Gonzaga up to No. 4 in KenPom and pushed its defensive efficiency to second nationally, trailing only Michigan. It was a one-sided affair from start to finish, despite some ugly, ugly performances by a few Zags looking to get back on track and some stellar performances from a few now hitting their stride.\n\nPepperdine spent most of the night searching for a workable offense while failing to even theorize about a workable defense. The Waves shot 34 percent from the field (26 percent from deep), struggled to find space inside, and were outscored 50-18 in the paint despite Graham Ike and Braden Huff combining for just 23 of Gonzaga’s total points.\n\nThere were still moments that wandered and stretches that lacked polish, and games this lopsided tend to blur rather than sharpen evaluation, but Gonzaga’s night in Malibu left far more to build on than to pick apart.\n\nPepperdine struggled to create space against Gonzaga throughout the night, with most possessions ending in rushed decisions or heavily contested looks. Pepperdine’s Aaron Clark and Styles Phipps combined to go 3-for-22 on the night while the Waves finished 5-for-19 from three, a credit once again to the Emmanuel Innocenti/Jalen Warley combo that’s been locking everyone down from the perimeter. Similarly, turnovers piled up often enough to flip the floor, with Gonzaga converting 14 of them into 24 points. Much of the disruption came from activity around the rim, where Tyon Grant-Foster recorded a team-high four blocks, including a couple of recoveries that erased shots late in the possession after initial breakdowns. Throughout the game, there were moments where help arrived a beat late, particularly with Gonzaga cycling through unfamiliar lineups, but Pepperdine rarely capitalized, often settling for difficult jumpers rather than turning those openings into sustained offense. After going 4-for-10 from three in the first half, the Zags held the Waves to just 1-for-9 in the second.\n\nDefense to offense pic.twitter.com/eWPvfhDbJx\n\n— Gonzaga Basketball (@ZagMBB) December 29, 2025\n\nBraeden Smith was simply stellar against Pepperdine. Back in the starting lineup for the first time since the Arizona State game, he poured in 15 points in just 18 minutes, shooting 6-for-8 from the field while still stacking eight assists, grabbing five rebounds, and committing just one turnover. He opened the second half by scoring eight points in the first two and a half minutes, picking up right where he left off after dropping 22 against Oregon last week. Early in the season, Smith seemed a bit tentative moving the ball, managing pace, and trying to mirror the steadiness Ryan Nembhard brought to the position last year. Of late, however, he’s been playing his own game, the kind of game that made him Patriot League Player of the Year at Colgate. He’s been calling his own number without hesitation, turning the corner when lanes appeared, and forcing defenders to react to him rather than wait him out. That assertiveness pulled help higher, loosened coverages, and created space before the defense had a chance to settle, a dynamic that shifted the shape of Gonzaga’s offense possession by possession.\n\nBraeden Smith and @ZagMBB handle business in Malibu ✔️#WCChoops #WeRiseintheWest pic.twitter.com/K7BQ5qIKXe\n\n— West Coast Conference Basketball (@WCChoops) December 29, 2025\n\nAs good as Braeden Smith was, Mario Saint-Supery was… not. The Spanish freshman had one of those nights where nothing goes right. He still finished with four assists and four boards, but he also finished 1-for-7 from the field in 18 minutes off the bench, committed four turnovers, and somehow fouled out with roughly six minutes remaining in the second half. For reference, the new haircut probably cracked the top seven ‘Mario problems’ of the evening, but no higher. A week after seeing his name pop up on early 2026 draft boards, his stat line against Pepperdine is one he’d probably prefer to leave back in 2025.\n\nAll that being said, Saint-Supery is going to be fine. Saint Supery has been dealing with a rough flu bug, played only 13 minutes against Oregon last week, and is still feeling his way through the speed and physicality of college basketball in the U.S., a learning curve that rarely looks clean in the middle. The fouls came fast, a couple were extremely questionable, the turnovers snowballed, and the rhythm never arrived. It happens, especially to dudes who play with the kind of edge and urgency that Saint Supery has become known for. And he will bounce back.\n\nSiant-Supery’s burst, creativity, and comfort playing through uptempo chaos still fit naturally into Gonzaga’s offense, even if the timing has gone sideways for the moment. If anything, we now have a Super Mario bounce-back game to look forward to. And I predict it’ll happen sooner rather than later.\n\nIt was a quiet night from Gonzaga’s frontcourt, at least relative to the standard this group has set. The highest-scoring and most efficient big-man tandem in the country combined for 23 of Gonzaga’s 96 points, with Braden Huff finishing with 10 in 27 minutes and seeing his streak of 20-point games come to an end. Despite the decreased scoring load, the efficiency never wavered. Huff went 5-for-7 from the field and added four assists, and the usage felt deliberate, with coach Mark Few leaning into extended stretches of Huff going solo at the five while Graham Ike spent more time on the bench than he has been of late.\n\nTough stuff from B Huff pic.twitter.com/uCxEEzE4tK\n\n— Gonzaga Basketball (@ZagMBB) December 29, 2025\n\nIke also still filled the box score, posting another double-double with 13 points and 10 rebounds in 23 minutes while committing just a single foul. Even on a night where touches were limited and roles shifted, Gonzaga’s frontcourt stayed productive, efficient, and stable, which is about as much as you can ask from a group that has already carried such a heavy load this season.\n\n— Gonzaga Basketball (@ZagMBB) December 29, 2025\n\nTowards the middle of the second half, Ismaila Diagne got his first extended run of minutes in weeks. He’s still struggling to find the rim offensively, but it’s hard to complain about his seven rebounds (three offensive) in just 8 minutes.\n\nWith a quieter scoring night from the bigs, Gonzaga spent the evening seeing where else they could generate some production. Braeden Smith accounted for a lot of it, but the wings also shone against Pepperdine. Davis Fogle continued to turn short runs into real production, finishing with 15 points in just 16 minutes. He went 5-for-7 from the field, knocked down 2-for-3 from three, and added two offensive rebounds, again translating limited minutes into outsized output. His approach remains score-first and occasionally skews overly aggressive, but the buckets keep him on the floor. Each appearance looks a little steadier, a little more composed within the offense, a little more patient on defense, and the question surrounding his role feels increasingly tied to roster depth rather than readiness.\n\nThose minutes remain competitive because Tyon Grant-Foster delivered yet another full stat line against the Waves. He led Gonzaga with 18 points, missed just one shot all night, and added four blocks. There were defensive breakdowns and a few headlong drives towards the rim that ended in the muck, but the offensive possessions tended to resolve quickly when Grant-Foster had space to operate. The remaining challenge lies in fitting Grant-Foster’s style into the broader offensive structure while tightening the defensive reads, though Grant-Foster’s athleticism and versatility are impossible to keep on the bench when he’s producing at a high rate.\n\nAfter a few uneven outings, the Pepperdine game felt like the closest Grant-Foster’s come to channeling his explosiveness and athleticism into the offense instead of asking them to carry it.\n\nMario to Tyon pic.twitter.com/O50gpr0y9W\n\n— Gonzaga Basketball (@ZagMBB) December 29, 2025\n\nThis was a good win, even if it never felt especially clean. Gonzaga rarely looks fully formed in late December, and this time of year tends to bring uneven stretches no matter who’s on the other side. The larger factor, though, was the opponent. Pepperdine’s offensive limitations made it strangely difficult to look sharp while winning by 40.\n\nSpin cycle pic.twitter.com/MqIA0A8FGv\n\n— Gonzaga Basketball (@ZagMBB) December 29, 2025\n\nFoul trouble and dead-ball stretches pushed Gonzaga into a handful of unfamiliar lineup combinations (Adam Miller playing point guard? Davis Fogle at the four?), rhythm never really settled, and pace came and went in short waves rather than building across long stretches. Coming off a non-conference slate that demanded something close to full attention every night, it also looked like a group carrying some fatigue, both physical and mental, even as the margin kept expanding.\n\nAnd still, the numbers stacked up. Another blowout, another pile of efficient stat lines, another night where the flaws were visible without ever threatening the outcome. That combination has become familiar. Gonzaga keeps winning big while leaving room for improvement, dominating games that feel loose in real time and then look like bloodbaths when you check the box score. The fact that this team can do that, and still feel unfinished, remains one of the more thrilling parts of where the season sits right now.\n\nThe Zags now head to San Diego to take on the Toreros on Tuesday, December 30. Tip-off scheduled for 6:30 PST, coverage provided by KHQ locally and ESPN+ nationally.",

    "fullText": "Bears’ future on display as Williams–Loveland chemistry shines in narrow loss originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe connection between Caleb Williams and Colston Loveland continues to show promise for the Chicago Bears.\n\nThe pair delivered again Sunday night against the San Francisco 49ers, even though Chicago came up just short in a 42–38 loss that wasn’t decided until the final play near the goal line.\n\nLoveland drew a season-high 10 targets, finishing with six catches for 94 yards. His night included a 36-yard touchdown reception from Williams in the second quarter.\n\nLoveland was also open on the game’s final snap. As Williams extended the play, film showed the rookie tight end breaking free in the back of the end zone, creating a brief window where the throw was there to be made.\n\nThat chemistry matters for Chicago’s future. Williams and Loveland are the Bears’ last two first-round picks, and the offense is built around their ability to grow together. Loveland’s best outing this season came in Week 7 against Cincinnati, when he posted six catches for 118 yards and two touchdowns. After that, the rookie averaged just 42 receiving yards over the next seven games before rebounding Sunday night.\n\nThrough 17 weeks, Loveland has totaled 622 yards on 69 receptions with four touchdowns. Williams finished the loss 25-of-42 for 330 yards and two scores. He now needs 270 passing yards in Week 18 to become the first quarterback in franchise history to reach 4,000 yards in a season.\n\nWith one week remaining, the Bears have already clinched the NFC North but are eliminated from contention for the No. 1 seed. Chicago hosts Detroit in Week 18 with positioning still at stake, as the Bears look to secure the No. 2 seed rather than slipping to No. 3.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City won their eighth consecutive match in all competitions when they beat Nottingham Forest 2-1 at The City Ground on Saturday. Pep Guardiola’s team’s spirit and determination shone through, and it helped them overcome a tough opponent on Saturday. It does stand out that there is spirit and energy back in this City squad after a tough 24/25 season for Pep Guardiola’s side. Speaking after his team’s important win over Nottingham Forest, Pep Guardiola has identified one specific moment that has been key in his team’s revival.\n\nSpeaking after his team’s win over Nottingham Forest, Pep Guardiola shared his belief that Manchester City’s time in the United States during their FIFA Club World Cup campaign last summer has played a key role in his team’s growth. Guardiola explained: “When we went out to Al-Hilal, it wasn’t the fact we didn’t win the Club World Cup – it was the fact we were so good there. It wasn’t holidays. I was annoyed because we were good there.”\n\n“Good in the training, the players in Boca Raton, in front of the beach, everyone was happy, we made a lot of dinners, a lot of talks on what was going to happen this season. And we wanted to extend to live there.”\n\n“But after that, I spoke with Pep (Lijnders), James (French), Manel (Estiarte), Hugo (Viana), Txiki (Begiristain), and something changed.”\n\n“It doesn’t mean we’re going to win but to recognise a team who can do eight wins in a row and compete in the way we do it.”\n\nManchester City was quick to point out that last summer’s FIFA Club World Cup was the beginning of a new season. It was a fresh start for Pep Guardiola’s side after a trying and testing 24/25 season. Although City went out of the tournament earlier than they would’ve liked at the hands of Al-Hilal, the benefits of City’s participation are clear to see.\n\nManchester City’s new signings and coaches had the opportunity to work together for the first time. The tournament was also a chance for the new-look Manchester City side to bond and build the team spirit that has been key to Manchester City’s play this season. That process began way back at the FIFA Club World Cup. There is still improvement to come in Manchester City’s play but the spirit that defines this City team has continued to grow since the seeds were planted in the United States.\n\nPep Guardiola believes that Manchester City’s FIFA Club World Cup campaign has played a key role in his team’s resurgence this season. The opportunity to get away and work together proved to be invaluable for the Manchester City players and staff. A strong team spirit was formed in the United States and it has shone through throughout Manchester City’s recent eight-match ubeaten run.",

    "fullText": "What Manchester United need most right now is an elite defensive midfielder capable of fitting into Ruben Amorim’s tactical plan.\n\nA high-intensity player, something Casemiro no longer is, despite his resurgence. Manuel Ugarte impressed against Newcastle, but even he has flattered to deceive since joining the club.\n\nINEOS are prepared to cut him loose, while the injured Kobbie Mainoo is not seen as a defensive midfielder by the head coach.\n\nCarlos Baleba of Brighton and Hove Albion was identified as a target last summer, but his price tag proved prohibitive.\n\nSince then, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson have joined him on the list, but all three are unlikely to move mid-season.\n\nThat means a short-term deal might be the only feasible solution. Ruben Neves, formerly of Wolverhampton Wanderers, and ex-Carrington graduate James Garner have emerged as alternatives.\n\nThe Portugal international’s wages might prove to be a stumbling block, while Everton are in no mood to lose the former United wonderkid.\n\nTeamtalk have now revealed that the 20-time English league champions have made aware of the terms of a potential January deal for Leon Goretzka.\n\n“We are starting to hear about new targets for United now so it looks like there will be an attempt to sign a midfield player outside of the likes of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba.\n\n“[Roma’s] Manu Kone is a name that has started to crop up and I think they have been made aware of the terms for signing [Bayern Munich’s] Leon Goretzka.”\n\nThe Bayern Munich midfielder has long been linked with a move to Old Trafford, but his age and waning influence have meant a move has never materialised.\n\nThe German started only 13 times in the Bundesliga last season, while this term, he has failed to start a game in the Champions League while finishing a match only on three occasions.\n\nThe 30-year-old’s contract ends next summer, and it makes very little sense to sign Leon Goretzka for a fee in the winter window.\n\nFeature image Stuart Franklin via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Redick believes the Lakers' win against the Kings is their most impressive of the season originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers were on a three-game losing streak over the past week, which led head coach J.J. Redick to call out his team. After the Christmas Day loss to the Houston Rockets, it was apparent that the Lakers needed a win.\n\nThey got a solid victory against the Sacramento Kings with a 125-101 result. This was one of the most well-rounded results of the year, as the Lakers won every single quarter. Luka Doncic was excellent once again, while LeBron James had the most efficient performance of his Lakers career.\n\nRedick is correct to be impressed by the performance because they deserve to be praised. The Lakers came into this game against the Kings with a mission, and that is to have a bounce-back night. It was rough for the Lakers to go through that losing stretch, especially since Austin Reaves also suffered an injury.\n\nMoving forward, this could be the model that the Lakers follow, as they want to keep fighting and winning. The game against the Kings was a show of dominance for the Lakers, as Doncic and James took over. Even Nick Smith Jr. had an impressive night filling in for Reaves.\n\nMore: Lakers head coach J.J. Redick sees Nick Smith Jr. playing a big role after Reaves injury\n\n\"We played together, we played for each other. We had probably one of our most consistent games, in terms of 48 minutes of pure competitiveness... This is the first game we've had all year that we've won all four quarters. That says a lot about the approach and the consistent mentality we played tonight,\" Redick said about the performance.\n\nAs long as the Lakers can perform to the highest level on both ends of the floor, they can properly climb the Western Conference standings. It will be a challenging time for the Lakers, as most teams would love to beat them.\n\nWith Doncic and James clicking, the Lakers have become more dangerous. Of course, losing Reaves was big, but the Lakers are becoming known for delivering perfect responses to losses. The Lakers fans would prefer not to lose games, but it was useful because Redick's team learned from their mistakes.\n\nLeBron James Reacts to Russell Westbrook Milestone Before Kings-Lakers\n\nLakers' LeBron James shot a 3-pointer left-handed, and it went as well as you'd expect\n\nJ.J.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOne year removed from their Super Bowl triumph, the Eagles find themselves near the top of the NFC.\n\nThe season hasn't been nearly as wondrous as last year. Philadelphia has been felled by bouts of inconsistency at different points, with quarterback Jalen Hurts going through a middling stretch halfway through the year as losses piled up.\n\nStill, Nick Sirianni's bunch remains in the mix, taking advantage of a weak division to rack up wins. Given its championship pedigree, Philly remains a dangerous threat in the postseason -- even if Hurts didn't look the part throughout the year.\n\nThere was no better evidence of the Eagles' might than their 13-12 win over the Bills on Sunday. Their attack was quiet, as it has been throughout the year. But that harrowing defense flexed its strength when it needed to. Performances like that translate well to winter football. Sirianni's team knows that better than most.\n\nHere's a look at Philadelphia's playoff picture following its win on Sunday.\n\nWith the Seahawks' win over the Panthers, the Eagles are officially unable to capture the NFC's No. 1 seed. They can only finish with 12 wins on the season, one short of Seattle's current mark. After the 49ers' win over the Bears Sunday night, San Francisco can leapfrog Philadelphia for first-place in the NFC standings with a win over Seattle on Saturday.\n\nThe Eagles aren't quite fixed to the No. 3 seed.

    "description": "The Buffalo Bills may play their final game in the original Highmark Stadium on Sunday, January 4.",
    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills finish up the 2025 NFL regular season with a home game against the New York Jets in Week 18. It’s also very likely set to become the final game in their current stadium, Highmark Stadium — which is also lovingly referred to as “The Ralph” after late founding Bills owner Ralph C. Wilson Jr.\n\nTo mark the occasion, One Bills Drive will welcome Bills Mafia and those otherwise for kickoff at 4:05 p.m. EST on Sunday, January 4, 2026. With much of Buffalo’s playoff options already in place, there’s little more to play for in Week 18 than perhaps a move up from their current status as the seven seed in the AFC playoff bracket. With a win, they could improve to the six seed if things go their way elsewhere on the scoreboard in Week 18.\n\nShould that happen, and if the Bills manage to go on a healthy winning streak in the postseason, it’s possible Buffalo could make its way back to hosting one more game to send their home for the last 52 seasons off into a proper playoff-tinged sunset.\n\nNext weekend’s regular-season finale once held lots of potential drama, with the Bills still in contention to win the AFC East until coming up short at the end of regulation against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 17. A win would have given Buffalo plenty of reason to focus on defeating the Jets in hopes of claiming the AFC East division crown. Instead, with the division title headed to Foxborough, MA, the team may choose to rest key starters for most of or the entirety of next Sunday’s game.\n\nThere are certain players who may still suit up in an effort to hit certain performance-based incentives, while others look to continue streaks and build toward franchise and/or NFL records. Yet, it’s possible this game features more backups than typical as the Bills turn their attention to the playoffs.\n\nTo celebrate the history of what began architectural life as Rich Stadium, the Bills unveiled alternate red helmets in homage to the Super Bowl teams that dominated the NFL in the 1990s. Buffalo is set to wear those helmets against the Jets on Sunday in what could be the last game in Orchard Park, NY before the new Highmark Stadium opens late in the summer of 2026.",

    "fullText": "The final Sunday in 2025 provided football fans with a memorable game that featured plenty of offensive firepower.\n\nWith how the Chicago Bears and San Francisco 49ers moved the ball and scored, it felt like a game that would end with whatever team had the ball last.\n\nCaleb Williams and the Bears had their shot with 2:15 left in the game, down by four points.\n\nThe Bears quarterback led his team on a 15-play drive that ended on the 49ers’ 2-yard line after Williams attempted to extend the play to find an open receiver. With the 49ers’ defense closing in, Williams threw a pass into the end zone, but it fell short.\n\nWild ending to an incredible game. pic.twitter.com/Xe6pJkBfEa\n\nThe Bears lost 42-38, which eliminates them from contention for the NFC’s No. 1 playoff seed. Still, as NFC North champions, they will host at least one playoff game at Soldier Field.\n\nHere are the five players who raised and lowered their stock in the Week 17 shootout at Levi’s Stadium.\n\nWilliams had one of his best passing performances of the season, completing 25 of 42 throws for 330 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nHis first TD pass of the day — to rookie Luther Burden III — was a perfectly thrown 35-yard strike in the first quarter.\n\nCaleb Williams drops it in a basket for the Luther Burden III touchdown\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nWilliams’ second TD pass — to Colston Loveland in the second quarter– displayed some of his elite quarterback traits. Williams drew the 49ers’ defense offside with his cadence, kept his eyes downfield after the snap, then threw a dart to his rookie tight end for a 36-yard score.\n\nCaleb Williams gets the 49ers on the hard count.\n\nTouchdown, Colston Loveland\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nWith how well the 49ers’ offense played, Williams needed to match Brock Purdy on the other side. For a majority of the game, that’s exactly what he did. However, he missed some throws.\n\nOn the final drive, Williams was heavily pressured on a first-and-10 play. He ran away from the pressure to his right but couldn’t complete a pass to wide-open Devin Duvernay on what might have been a game-winning TD.\n\nthis was 7 pic.twitter.com/WzuR5ONtEM\n\n— Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) December 29, 2025\n\nIt only took one play for the former All-Pro cornerback to change the game.\n\nJohnson jumped Jauan Jennings’ slant route and deflected Purdy’s first pass on the first play of the game into the air. T.J. Edwards intercepted the ball and returned it 34 yards for a pick six.\n\nT.J. EDWARDS, PICK-SIX ON THE FIRST PLAY OF THE GAME\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nJohnson finished the game with zero receptions allowed on one target. He wasn’t targeted for the remainder of the game after helping cause the pick six, but he also played limited snaps in the second half.\n\nJohnson has given up just seven receptions on 12 targets for 142 yards in six games this season, and he has one interception. It shows just how important keeping Johnson healthy is to the Bears’ defense.\n\nThe Bears’ rookie wide receiver returned to action after missing last week’s win over the Green Bay Packers and quickly made an impact.\n\nEntering their third drive, the Bears had failed to record a first down. Then Williams found Burden for a 10-yard gain on second down. Three plays later, Williams connected with Burden on an explosive 35-yard TD pass, giving Chicago’s offense its first points of the game late in the first quarter.\n\nCaleb Williams drops it in a basket for the Luther Burden III touchdown\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nBurden finished as the game’s leading receiver with eight receptions on nine targets for 138 yards and the TD. He was injured on the final play of the game, and head coach Ben Johnson didn’t have an immediate update on the rookie’s condition.\n\nThe Bears’ veteran linebacker had the daunting task of trying to contain Christian McCaffrey. The entire defense, especially Edmunds, failed to keep the 49ers’ versatile playmaker in check.\n\nMcCaffrey finished the first half with 18 carries for 121 yards and one TD. He added two receptions for 20 yards as a pass catcher before halftime.\n\n: NBC\nNFL+// https://t.co/Zkva0Y3QRRpic.twitter.com/Lw0glXcnaP\n\n— San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) December 29, 2025\n\nPer Pro Football Focus, Edmunds allowed seven receptions on seven targets for 55 yards and two TDs.\n\nThe 49ers’ offense, which features plenty of motions and shifts, forced Edmunds and the rest of the Bears’ defensive front to react slowly, and San Francisco benefited throughout the game, finishing with 496 total yards (200 rushing, 296 passing).\n\nThe Bears cornerback dealt with a hamstring injury and an illness throughout the week, but he was able to start against the 49ers.\n\nHe’s had a remarkable season, but this wasn’t a good showing. Per Pro Football Focus, Wright gave up four receptions on five targets for 73 yards in just the first half.\n\nWright looked a step slow and couldn’t stay in front of opposing receivers.\n\nThe post Five Bears whose stock went up or down in NFL Week 17 loss to 49ers appeared first on Marquee Sports Network - Home of the Cubs, Bears, Red Stars and Sky.",

    "fullText": "49ers playoff picture: How win over Bears impacts NFC West race, San Francisco's chances at No. 1 seed originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 49ers embraced the spotlight on Sunday night, in front of a raucous San Francisco faithful en route to a 42-38 win over the Bears.\n\nThe result was a momentous one for Kyle Shanahan's bunch. Not only did it cement the 49ers as true NFC contenders. But it also pushed San Francisco one step closer to NFC West and conference supremacy.\n\nBrock Purdy dazzled against Chicago's highly-touted defense, producing five touchdowns — and even more highlights — in an epic showcase. With a game against the NFC-leading Seahawks in Week 18, the Niners will need him to pull a rabbit out of his hat once more.\n\nHere's what you need to know about San Francisco's playoff prospects following its win over the Bears.\n\nMORE: How Seahawks, Bears and more can clinch NFC's No. 1 seed\n\nThe Niners' win on \"Sunday Night Football\" confirms that the NFC West crown and the NFC's No. 1 seed will be up for grabs in Week 18.\n\nThe result sets up nicely for hardcore observers and casual viewers alike. San Francisco is set to take on NFC pace-setters the Seahawks on Saturday night. The win effectively freezes the Rams out of NFC West contention as Los Angeles falls short of both the 49ers and Seahawks in tiebreakers.\n\nSimply, the winner of next weekend's duel will hoist the NFC West title. They'll get quite the reward as a result — home-field advantage throughout the postseason.\n\n*indicates a team has clinched a playoff berth.\n\nThe 49ers' win keeps them in the top spot among wild-card teams. They're currently slated to travel to Carolina to take on the Panthers in the first round of the postseason, although that could change depending on the results of their duel with Seattle.\n\nUpdated AFC, NFC standings in NFL playoff picture for Week 17\n\nHow Giants-Raiders Week 17 matchup likely decides No. 1 overall pick\n\nTexans, Packers among latest teams to clinch spot in NFL postseason\n\nSan Francisco sits in second-place in the NFC West standings upon the conclusion of Sunday night's contest. The Niners are one game short of division-leading Seattle, although it can turn back that disadvantage with a victory against the Seahawks on Saturday.\n\nLos Angeles, meanwhile, will have to settle for third-place in the division at the end of Week 17. The Rams can still surpass San Francisco should the 49ers lose to Seattle in Week 18 (and Los Angeles beats the Falcons in Week 17). However, if they finish with an identical record to their divisional counterparts, they'll fall short as a result of tiebreakers.\n\nSan Francisco has one game left in its regular season slate: a home clash with the Seahawks. Suffice to say, that matchup will have a major impact on the postseason bracket — the winner will win the NFC West and claim the NFC's top seed.",

Or maybe Kalani Sitake just really likes Pop-Tarts.\n\nWhatever the reason, shortly after No. 12 BYU beat No. 22 Georgia Tech 25-21 in the Pop-Tarts Bowl — a game that came down to the wire — the Cougars’ head coach removed a Pop-Tart from the functional football-shaped toaster trophy and devoured it.\n\nBYU coach Kalani Sitake inhales an entire Pop-Tart after winning the Pop-Tarts Bowl.\n pic.twitter.com/I5uT2vhSA0\n\n— Front Office Sports (@FOS) December 28, 2025\n\nThe impressive feat has gone viral.\n\n“We should all attack every aspect of our lives the way Kalani Sitake attacks a Pop-Tart,” ESPN senior writer Ryan McGee shared in a post on X that has over 35,000 views.\n\nWe should all attack every aspect of our lives the way Kalani Sitake attacks a Pop-Tart. pic.twitter.com/x5d0BnIBXr\n\n— Ryan McGee (@ESPNMcGee) December 28, 2025\n\nOne video of the moment, shared by Front Office Sports on X, has racked up more than 370,000 views.\n\nSitake’s speedy Pop-Tart consumption has also drawn comparisons to competitive eating legend Joey Chesnut — and even caught the attention of the formidable 17-time Nathan’s Hot Dog Eating Contest champion himself.\n\nThe Chestnut comparisons came quickly.\n\n“Kalani Sitake went Joey Chestnut style on this pop-tart,” Bleacher Report captioned a TikTok video.\n\n“BYU coach Kalani Sitake went Joey Chestnut-mode on the trophy Pop Tarts!” The Athletic similarly shared on X.\n\n“If he’s not in the Nathans hot dog contest next year we have failed as a nation,” one X user wrote on Front Office Sports’ post of the viral moment.\n\n“He Chestnutted that thing,” another X user wrote in response to the post.\n\nHe Chestnutted that thing... pic.twitter.com/YYm9RVaji6\n\n— That Guy You Like 🇺🇸🇪🇸 (@craigtherandall) December 28, 2025\n\nBut 247 Sports’ Jeff Hansen, who retweeted a video of Sitake in all of his Pop-Tart-eating glory, actually got a response from Chestnut.\n\n“Will @joeyjaws come to BYU this offseason?\" Hansen wrote on X, tagging Chestnut in the post.\n\nChestnut — who has actually consumed 100 Pop-Tarts in roughly 30 minutes — didn’t answer the question. But he did praise Sitake’s feat.\n\n“The man is a beast!” Chestnut replied to Hansen’s post. “And that trophy is next level.”\n\nThe man is a beast!!! And that trophy is next level.\n\n— Joey Chestnut (@joeyjaws) December 28, 2025\n\nOne of Chestnut’s most notable records is downing 76 hot dogs in 10 minutes — buns included.\n\nPer the Major League Eating website, other world records include 182 chicken wings in 30 minutes; 103 Krystal hamburgers in 8 minutes; 12 pounds of deep-fried asparagus spears in 10 minutes; 13.76 pounds of pork ribs in 12 minutes; 14.5 pounds of burritos in 10 minutes; and 121 Twinkies in 6 minutes.\n\nAnd while it wasn’t an official Major League Eating competition, Chestnut devoured 100 Pop-Tarts (10 different flavors) in roughly 30 minutes during a 2020 YouTube livestream.\n\nBut don’t count on a Chestnut vs. Sitake Pop-Tart matchup anytime soon; Chestnut considers Pop-Tarts to be one of the worst food challenges of his career.\n\n“It was terrible. I thought it would be delicious, start to end, but it got really, really old really quickly,” he told Mashed in 2020. “They got super dry, it tore up my mouth, it took me longer. It was not as enjoyable as I thought it would be.”",

That ties the longest streak in NFL history.\n\nThe Steelers lost to the 2-10-1 Bengals in 2020 (Pittsburgh entered the game 11-2), they tied the 0-8 Lions in 2021 (the Steelers entered the game 5-3), they lost to the 2-10 Cardinals in 2023 (Pittsburgh was 7-4), they lost to the 2-10 Patriots the very next week in 2023 (7-5), and they lost on Sunday to the 3-12 Browns (9-6).\n\nWhile many players have changed since 2020, there are some constants, both on the roster and the coaching staff (starting with, obviously, head coach Mike Tomlin). The situation speaks to the habit of overlooking a subpar foe, losing just enough focus to not beat them.\n\nFortunately for the Steelers, they won't be facing any more teams with bad records, either next week or in the postseason, if they can beat the 8-8 Ravens and qualify for the playoffs. It the Steelers lose to Baltimore, the Steelers can blame themselves for another failure to handle a team with a very bad record.",

Metcalf, failing to score a touchdown for the first time all season. All they managed was a pair of Chris Boswell field goals in the second quarter before getting shut out for the entire second half.\n\nAfter starting December 3-0 with three strong performances, Aaron Rodgers endured his worst game in four weeks. The 42-year-old QB looked his age, completing only 21 of 39 passes for 168 yards and no touchdowns.\n\nRodgers was sacked twice, but not by Myles Garrett, who was held without a sack in both of his games against Pittsburgh this year. He remains 0.5 sacks shy of the NFL single-season record of 22.5, which he’ll try to break in the Browns’ season finale against the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nAfter the game, Garrett criticized the Steelers for seeming more focused on stopping him rather than winning the game.\n\n#Browns DE Myles Garrett on the #Browns win vs. the #Steelers:\n\n“They were more worried about keeping me away from Aaron (Rodgers) than getting the win.

Rodgers was getting the ball out quickly rather than letting plays develop, and Garrett may have been in his head.\n\nGarrett is one of the rare defensive players in the NFL who can impact a game with his mere presence, and that may have been the case on Sunday.\n\nRegardless, now the Steelers must beat the Baltimore Ravens at home next week if they want to make the playoffs.

    "fullText": "Chelsea are reportedly interested in bringing back one of their former experienced players as a free agent in the summer.\n\nThe Blues could certainly use an extra experienced head or two going forward and adding into a squad that is young and sometimes, still quite immature.\n\nSo this is a story that will please many fans to read. But it will also be a case of we will believe it when we see it, because we know that this just isn’t the type of signing that this current Chelsea do.\n\nAntonio Rudiger is a popular figure amongst Chelsea fans still, and I believe that the majority would love to see him back as a free agent come the summer of 2026, and this is what could happen, per the latest report at least.\n\nAntonio Rudiger in action for Real Madrid. (Photo by Alex Grimm/Getty Images)\n\nIn Spain, media outlet AS are claiming that Antonio Rudiger could leave as a free agent in the summer due to his contract running out and no new deal yet to be on the horizon.\n\nGalatasaray in Turkey are the heaviest linked team as being interested in signing him. But as well as them, Chelsea are also named as an interested club.\n\nAs I say, we will believe it when we see it.\n\nChelsea head coach Enzo Maresca is a strong candidate to replace Pep Guardiola at Manchester City in the summer, should the current City boss depart his club.\n\nMeanwhile, we are almost in January now and that means a new transfer window opening up. One player who wants a move is Raheem Sterling, and it looks like Fulham could be a possible option for him next month as he looks to kick his career back into place.",

    "description": "Simon Adingra and Dominic Calvert-Lewin chipped in as the Lads drew with Leeds. What did our writers make of the game?",
    "fullText": "Firstly, I hope everyone had a brilliant Christmas and has an excellent year ahead!\n\nHe needed it. For me he’s been so hit and miss since we signed him, but he was brilliant.\n\nThe first touch that set up the goal was superb and the finish was equally as good. Let’s hope this is the start of the things to come!\n\nAnother good week up top for the big man, with a brilliant first half, which just lacked the goal.\n\nHe definitely could’ve done better with the header but you can’t fault his ability to hold the ball up and bully defenders.\n\nPoor Dan. Apart from Granit Xhaka, he’s been my player of the season.\n\nI do hope the reports of a five-week layoff are extremely wide of the mark as we have some tough games coming up — and I do think Omar Alderete looks more comfortable alongside him rather than Nordi Mukiele.\n\nI’m a little concerned in the lack of chances we’re creating in or around the box.\n\nThe last five minutes of the game we rushed passes or were too safe — Enzo Le Fée’s first-time cross hitting a defender when in acres of space is a case in point.\n\nWe came out a little better against Brighton before quickly dropping off, but on Sunday, we were awful after the break; Leeds ran us ragged for the majority of it and we looked terrible out of possession.\n\nLuckily, for the second week in a row, poor finishing from the opposition ensured we left with a point.\n\nWe’ve reached the end of the calendar year unbeaten at home on our return to the Premier League — which can only breed confidence among the squad and offer great encouragement to the fans.\n\nThirty points and fifth spot would’ve been nice but hey ho — mustn’t grumble!\n\nLutsharel Geertruida was outstanding and stood out amongst several bright performances.\n\nGreat to see Simon Adingra curling that beautiful goal in, and other notable mentions should be given to a returning Dennis Cirkin and Enzo Le Fée, who never stopped running.\n\nI also thought Eliezer Mayenda offered something different at the end.\n\nThere were several times when our passing just didn’t come off.\n\nBrian Brobbey was guilty in the first half of not being on the same page as his team mates on at least three occasions, and even Granit Xhaka was guilty of some sloppy passes.\n\nIt was one of those days when things just didn’t quite work.\n\nSitting as I do in the north east corner, I’m used to having to listen to the away fans giving it large. Unfortunately, we didn’t manage to shut the Leeds fans up and they remained buoyant throughout.\n\nProbably the loudest away fans this season — and this may be linked to the exodus from some of our fans with five minutes to go. I thought we’d seen the last of this annoying habit.\n\nOnly ourselves and the league leaders can boast an unbeaten home record — and long may it continue.\n\nIt’s some feat and although we often had our backs to the wall, the Lads kept believing and Régis Le Bris changed things at the right time.\n\nBrian Brobbey was immense in the first half and deserved to score late on in the half.\n\nHe’s a real handful and will continue to be so. He was too isolated after the break and a change of shape was needed, but his contribution is and will be immense.\n\nWe have to hope his ankle isn’t badly damaged as his value to this side was clear to see in his absence.\n\nThe back four were good but he adds physicality and I think the lads around him are better players for it.\n\nWe had a really good first half but looked like we’d left the intensity in the dressing room when we came back out.\n\nWe conceded one but for the first twenty minutes of the second half, we struggled to get back into the game. Leeds’ poor finishing and decision-making helped us out but we need to keep the intensity up — maybe the fact we have the lads at AFCON and that Ballard was out has put too much onto the eleven we’re putting out week on week.\n\nBurnout might be an issue as the season progresses, so rotation will be key.\n\nSunderland came out of the traps at the start of the campaign in a totally unexpected fashion, with a mixture of flair, determination and mild abrasiveness which identifies us as potential qualifiers for European competition.\n\nWhile we were clearly missing some of our seven absent players, Leeds played surprisingly well, especially in midfield.\n\nThey took a leaf from our playbook and played in a style that was very reminiscent of ours. Imitation is a sincere form of flattery.\n\nWe didn’t collapse despite some very good play from the visitors.\n\nSimon Adingra’s goal was excellent but around the seventy-minute mark I messaged a friend “We’re somehow holding on. Need to get the ball forward quicker to Mayenda and Isidor. Missing the seven players who are out”.\n\nHowever, the satisfying part is that we survived significant Leeds pressure and even created some half-chances at the end. This has been a hallmark of Sunderland’s season: resilience, as well as keeping our shape and focus.\n\nDan Ballard’s absence showed what a massive impact we’ve got used to from him every week — both as an excellent defender but also as an attacking threat.\n\nIt’s an open question as to whether Luke O’Nien would’ve been selected if available, and recruiting a top centre back may become a priority if Ballard proves fragile in terms of recovery from injuries.\n\nThere was also some untidy play.\n\nIn left midfield, Adingra was the exception but Enzo Le Fée was quieter than usual, and even Granit Xhaka wasn’t his dominant self. The defence did OK but Dennis Cirkin took time to settle and Trai Hume was walking a tightrope in terms of fouls, picking up his fourth booking of the season.\n\nSo nothing terrible — just some cause for concern which needs to be addressed in preparation for Manchester City.\n\nBrobbey was immense in the first half.\n\nA veritable battering ram, he swatted off Leeds defenders like flies.\n\nAdingra’s running and his goal were superb, and Cirkin fitted in well, much to my surprise.\n\nWe lost control of midfield in the second half and wayward passing almost handed Leeds a second goal.\n\nThe loss of Dan Ballard was sorely felt — I don’t think Dominic Calvert-Lewin scores that goal if Ballard was playing.\n\nFailure to convert chances is costing us. Two gilt-edged chances went begging at the end of the first half and if ever we needed a second goal, it was yesterday.\n\nLeeds are no mugs and a draw was probably a fair result, but there were chances for both sides to win the match.",

Whether Dennis will return to San Diego on a standard G League contract is not known yet, but the Clippers do own his G League rights.\n\nWashington Jr. fills the third Two-way spot Los Angeles has, alongside Jordan Miller and Kobe Sanders. The latter two have yet to suit up for San Diego this season, as they've been on LAC duties due to injuries and roster inconsistency.\n\nThe 24 year-old guard in his stint for the Clippers averaged 19.9 points, 5.8 assists, 5.1 rebounds, and 1.7 steals over 36.1 minutes per game through 16 games. He really put his name on the map and essentially forced LA's hand to sign him after averaging 34 points, eight rebounds, five assists, and three steals per game during the NBA G League Winter Showcase.\n\nBack in the NBA!

He's been killing it down here in the G League. I think we've played 15, 16 games or something like that and he's been a monster in every single one of them,\" said Clippers forward Zach Freemantle.\n\nHe also noted that Washington Jr.'s hardwork being noticed and recognized is a good thing and that he deserves the call up.\n\nTyTy Washington Jr has been signed to the LA Clippers on a two-way contract. He replaced RayJ Dennis who was subsequently waived. San Diego will be shorthanded tonight against Miami's G League team -- Story later tonight\n\n— Jared Knobloch (@jknobloch8) December 29, 2025\n\nWith all the two-way players with Los Angeles, and no players on assignment (i.e. Yanic Konan Niderhouser), that left San Diego shorthanded against the Skyforce with only eight active players.\n\nBeing shorthanded, they ended up losing in a close game against Sioux Falls 101-98. The Clippers fall to 1-3 in the regular season, a stark difference from their 9-5 record during the Tip-off tournament.\n\nDespite the loss, Freemantle had a career-high 32 points, along with 10 rebounds. \"I was just trying to do whatever I could to help my team win,\" he said. \"There was some opportunity for me to score the ball tonight, and I just tried to take advantage of what the game gave me.\"\n\nFREEEEEEEEMANTLE pic.twitter.com/s9SovKnjPn\n\n— SD Clippers (@sandiego_clips) December 29, 2025\n\nThe Clippers will have some time off before having a rematch with the Raptors 905 on January 2.

    "description": "Malc Dugdale reports on a gritty Sunday afternoon affair at the Stadium of Light — a fair result, all things considered?",
    "fullText": "When the news came out that Dan Ballard wasn’t fit enough to make the starting eleven for Leeds’ visit, a lot of concerns arose for many, but in the end we did a decent job in defence.\n\nThere were extended periods — especially in the second half — where it was very much “backs against the wall”, and the lads who had to cover for both the AFCON losses and the Ballard-sized gap did very well.\n\nIt’s a real shame that we’ve potentially lost the big Northern Irish international for four weeks or so, but apart from losing Dominic Calvert-Lewin for a high-quality run in between the centre backs that met a very good cross, the lads who stepped up at short notice did very well.\n\nIt was clear that Dennis Cirkin tired late on and with more quality options on the bench, maybe he would’ve been replaced, but we defended steadfastly at times (that save off the line from Trai Hume was massive), and we deserved the point we earned in the end.\n\nIt was mentioned on Haway The Podcast that Simon Adingra has taken his omission from the Ivory Coast squad quite hard and that he’s really stepped up his training to grab this chance to shine — and how he shone with that finish just before the half-hour mark!\n\nIf he wants to grab the attention of his national coach, he did exactly the right thing by scoring his first Premier League goal for the Lads, and what a belter it was.\n\nThe ball from Granit Xhaka was an absolute peach but the touch and curled effort just inside the post was a thing of beauty. Adingra was one of the best players on the pitch and after his unconvincing showing at Brighton, he really took his game to the Leeds defence — especially in the first period.\n\nHe was massively unlucky in the dying moments of the first half when an excellent cross to Brian Brobbey at the back post only managed to rattle the corner of post and bar. If that had led to an assist and goal, he would’ve deserved it.\n\nIf this is the start of Adingra really showing what he can do, we have a lot to be grateful for as he didn’t head to Africa for the competition he’s missing out on.\n\nElsewhere, I was a little surprised to see Chris Rigg start and while he had a decent enough game and made some good contributions at times, I do think what Eliezer Mayenda offered when he came on was a level above.\n\nRigg did OK and his tackle to win the ball back about twenty minutes in was what every Sunderland fan wants to see. That said, Mayenda came on, offered so much \n\nThe run he made on the seventy-fifth minute was a glimpse of what we’ve missed and something we don’t really get from Rigg.\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see how this pans out as Rigg is clearly doing something to impress the coach, but when we have less of the physicality from the AFCON lads on the park, making up for that with Mayenda rather than Rigg makes a lot of sense to me.\n\nUp front, I was really happy with the hold-up play from Brian Brobbey and on another day, he could’ve had a goal or two.\n\nHis physicality and strength with his back to goal created a load of issues, and when he and Adingra both committed fully to tackles and put Joe Rodon off the park, the grit of the big number nine had an even bigger impact — and quite legally so.\n\nI thought there was a half-decent shout for a very advanced free kick or penalty on one or two occasions — including not long before he hit the bar with a header — but that wasn’t to be. I’m not sure if the referee wanted to give anything to the home side but with the graft and muscle that Brobbey put in, it showed me why he’s currently preferred to Wilson Isidor.\n\nHowever, given the lack of goals from both Brobbey and Isidor, I do think we may dip into the transfer market in January.\n\nIf Mayenda isn’t seen as an attacking option and the two lads aren’t scoring often enough, we could do with another player up top to make sure we hit thirty five points as soon as possible in 2026, and kick on from there.\n\nWe could easily have lost that game and with a handful of players away on international duty and star players like Dan Ballard unavailable at short notice, to keep our unbeaten home record into 2026 and not let in any of the barrage of attempts which Leeds created in the second half represents a point gained rather than two lost.\n\nLeeds did a good job and much like the fixtures in the Championship, there was very little to separate the two teams — nor the tactics the two coaches used to counteract each other.\n\nThere were times when we were far too wasteful with the ball and times when we should’ve shot rather than overplayed the build up — such as the chance for Lutsharel Geertruida inside the first twenty minutes.\n\nThere were also times when we stood off too much (including in the buildup to the Leeds goal) and many points when we had to dig in and do all we could not to lose, but we got a point — which we deserved — and we move on to the next one.\n\nIf we can continue to build points with great goals like that and last-ditch defending, despite all the challenges thrown at us, we’ll be in the mix for the top ten or even top six to eight come the end of the season.",

    "fullText": "You could point at quite a few games like this during the relegation of 1990-91, but this one sums up how it went quite nicely. We shouldn’t forget that it was one of those relegations where you were still proud of the Lads and considering how many of the side started out with us in Division Three, it was a heroic effort to stay up.\n\nAfter a good start that included a home win over Manchester United and a draw against Division One’s glamour side Tottenham Hotspur at Roker, where Gary Lineker and Paul Gascoigne rocked up only weeks after heartbreak at Italia 90’.\n\nSoon after, we began a trend of losing leads or throwing away a point by conceding a late goal. Everton at Roker, Wimbledon away, Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Manchester City at home, Spurs away, Norwich back on home soi,l and Palace on the road were all games where this occurred before we come to the fixture back on this day in 1990.\n\nAll of this surrendering of points meant we sat one point and one place above the side who occupied the last remaining relegation place, and yep, you guessed it – it was Don Howe’s Queens Park Rangers.\n\nThis was a proper six-pointer and since the Palace game at Selhurst Park was only three days prior to this and we had taken nothing from a game we were winning with around ten minutes to go, you might have thought we learnt our lesson.\n\nAn injury to Marco Gabbiadini meant that David Rush continued to partner new-boy Peter Davenport up top but after around twenty minutes at Loftus Road, the former Manchester United striker could play no further part after picking up a knock, which meant we now had the inexperienced forward line of Rush and Warren Hawke.\n\nHowever, five minutes after the change, a Tony Norman goal kick was flicked on by Gordon Armstrong and Rush was through on goal until he was brought down by QPR keeper Jan Stejskal and the one and only Roger Milford (the man who controversially didn’t send off Gazza in the 1991 FA Cup final) pointed to the spot. Without our first-choice strikers, it was down to experienced midfielder Paul Bracewell to take the kick – but his casual kick was easily saved.\n\nAround ten minutes later, the home side punished Sunderland for missing the spot kick when Ray Wilkins crossed for Danny Maddix to head in from close range. But on the stroke of half-time, and not for the first time that season, Denis Smith’s side forced their way back into it, this time Colin Pascoe knocking it in from close range after a save from the keeper.\n\nMoments into the second half and Sunderland were on the attack and forced the referee to point at the spot for a second time. Again it was Rush who didn’t give the home defenders any peace in possession, and was eventually tripped by full-back David Bardsley. This time it was Kevin Ball and he sent the keeper the wrong way to put the Lads in front.\n\nJust after the hour mark it was 2-2 after another penalty. This time it was John Kay who was overenthusiastic with a challenge when the ball was in the air and Milford thought it might be best to even the scores a little when it came to penalty kicks. Roy Wegerle stepped up and sent Norman the wrong way.\n\nAt this point, it became a game of basketball with both sides going for maximum points and it was a case of next goal the winner. With around ten minutes remaining, the goal came. Wilkins sprayed the ball wide to Bardsley with the outside of his foot, the full-back was then allowed to make his way to the edge of the box by Richard Ord who backed off, before floating the ball to the back post, where Mark Falco was there to volley home.\n\nIt was another cruel day in a season of cruel days.\n\nSunderland: Norman, Kay, Bennett, Ball, Ord, Owers, Bracewell, Armstrong, Pascoe, Rush, Davenport (Hawke (Hardyman))\n\nQPR: Stejskal, Bardsley, Caesar, Maddix, Sansom, Barker, Wilkins, Tillson, Sinton, Falco, Wegerle (Meaker) Subs Not Used: Wilson",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Lakers knocked off the Sacramento Kings, 125-101, on Sunday, Dec. 28 behind a 34-point performance from Luka Dončić, including 24 in the first half.\n\nThe Lakers (20-10) were led by Dončić and LeBron James, who added 24 points on 84% shooting from the field. The Kings were playing on consecutive nights, following their win against the Dallas Mavericks on Dec. 27.\n\n\"The product that we were putting out there just wasn't there,\" Kings head coach Doug Christie told reporters after the game. \"That obviously starts with me, always. We came in and we weren't grabbing hold and controlling. The level of physicality wasn't to the level that we draw the line in the sand and say this is what it's going to be.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Sacramento was led by DeMar DeRozan, with 22 points, and rookie Maxime Raynaud who recorded a double-double, 16 points and 10 rebounds. Six players scored in double-figures, including Malik Monk, Nique Clifford and Dennis Schröder, who each had 11.\n\nThe Kings shot just 28% from 3-point distance and had 19 turnovers on the evening, which turned into 23 points for the Lakers. Sacramento dropped to 8-24, going into their next game on Tuesday, Dec. 30 in an away game against the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\n\"Our sense of urgency, the ability to have multiple efforts, it just wasn't at the level that it's been at period,\" Christie said. \"We have to make sure that we bounce back versus the Clippers with a high level of energy, effort and intensity, physicality, all of those things.\"\n\nSacramento Kings: News, stats, injuries and more\n\nLebron James hit a pull-up jumper at the top of the key to end the first quarter. It capped a 10-point first quarter for James, as the Lakers led 30-24 after 12 minutes. Luka had nine points.\n\nThe Kings were led by DeMar DeRozan, who scored eight points in the first period.\n\nMalik Monk got going early in the second, hitting on back-to-back three point field goals.\n\nThe Kings allowed the Lakers to get transition baskets including a LeBron James reverse dunk. The Kings got to their spots on offense for timely buckets.\n\nThe deficit grew as the Kings got sloppy with the basketball and threw consecutive turnovers. Luka Doncic scored 15 points in the second quarter. He had 24 total in the first half.\n\nThe Kings trailed 68-53 at the end of the first half.\n\nThe Kings came out lethargic to start the third quarter. A step slow to loose balls, offensively, they looked stagnant.\n\nThe lead grew to 20 before Sacramento head coach Doug Christie called a timeout. Kings trailed 73-53.\n\nThe Lakers had everything going in the third. They knocked down open threes, step back mid-range shots and points in the paint. The biggest lead was 26 for the Lakers.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter, Sacramento trailed 99-80.\n\nThe Lakers’ 3-point barrage continued into the fourth quarter. The deficit proved to be too large for the Kings to mount a comeback, the largest lead for the Lakers grew to 30.\n\nSacramento lost by a final score of 125-101.\n\nFrustrate their stars: Sacramento has played scrappy, stifling defense. It's what helped them in their win against Dallas and a big win against Houston on Dec. 21. Keep that same pressure on Lakers stars Luka Dončić and LeBron James and make them uncomfortable. Dončić and James combined for 58 points. James shot 84% from the field.\n\nLean on youth for energy: In the second night of a back-to-back, the Kings should rely on their rookies and young guys to provide energy early and often throughout the game. Look for guys like Keon Ellis, Maxime Raynaud, Dylan Cardwell and Nique Clifford to spark fire. Raynaud tallied a double-double (16 points, 10 rebounds) and Cardwell scored seven points and seven rebounds, while being a +1 on the floor. Clifford scored 11, while Ellis only scored two.\n\nDefend without fouling:As energetic and up-tempo as the Kings are, it's important to defend without fouling as the Lakers are third in the league in free throws made and second in free throws attempted. The Kings had 19 free throw attempts, compared to the Lakers' 18 shots.\n\nHomecoming, revenge tour: It's a homecoming for Los Angeles natives Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan. There's nothing like home cooking. Plus, whenever Westbrook plays his former team or teammates, it feels personal. DeRozan led the team with 22 points but it wasn't enough. Westbrook added 13 points and had six turnovers.\n\nDec. 30 at Los Angeles Clippers\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Kings lose to Lakers on Sunday night: Highlights",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are planning a midfield revamp come next summer, and they have identified three top-class Premier League midfielders to replace their ageing stars.\n\nCasemiro, despite his resurgence, no longer has the legs to complete 90 minutes in the English top-flight every gameweek.\n\nAnd despite his impressive showing against Newcastle, Manuel Ugarte remains a disappointing signing, with INEOS looking to move him on at the earliest opportunity.\n\nSkipper Bruno Fernandes remains the club’s best player, but the co-owners might look to sell him like last summer. Kobbie Mainoo has failed to impress the head coach.\n\nWhether all three depart or not remains to be seen, but the Red Devils have identified the likes of Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton, and Elliot Anderson as potential replacements.\n\nThe Crystal Palace star’s game-reading skills and ability to dictate play from deep reminds many of United legend Michael Carrick, and he would be a huge asset to have.\n\nHowever, his impressive form has seen many teams enter the race, including Spanish giants Real Madrid.\n\nPalace have made it clear that they are open to a sale should they receive a significant offer.\n\nAnd now, Teamtalk have revealed that Tottenham Hotspur are prepared to break the bank to land the England international.\n\n“Tottenham Hotspur are interested in stepping up their pursuit of Adam Wharton in 2026, with sources indicating the club would be prepared to make a very significant offer for the midfielder.\n\n25/26 season stats via Transfermarkt\n\n“Spurs initially explored a move for Wharton in the previous transfer window, but Crystal Palace made it clear they were completely unwilling to entertain any approaches at a time when Manchester United, Chelsea and Real Madrid were also monitoring him.\n\n“Since then, competition for Wharton has only intensified, and Tottenham know they will need to act quickly and decisively if they are to win the race for his signature.”\n\nThe 21-year-old has indicated that he will only move to a club which can offer him Champions League football.\n\nThat means Spurs, who are currently 11th, might struggle to offer him the same unless their on-pitch performances improve drastically.\n\nOn the other hand, Amorim’s men are sixth, only three points away from fourth place. A push in the second half of the season could propel the Old Trafford side back to Europe’s top-tier club competition. Thereby, increasing their chances of landing Adam Wharton.\n\nFeature image Eddie Keogh via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Andrew Smithson looks at the main stories from Sunderland’s gritty, end-of-year home draw with Leeds United!",
    "fullText": "I’d been thinking prior to the game that it had been really encouraging to see Ballard playing so often recently, but football being football, I should’ve known that something was going to be around the corner.\n\nA massive part of the team both defensively and offensively, his recent run of form and fitness has brought him into the national spotlight so learning of his injury and possible spell on the sidelines came as a real blow — particularly with our squad already being stretched due to the number of players away competing in the African Cup of Nations.\n\nConsidering the changes this news forced on the back four p, the defence still looked organised, but Sunderland supporters will obviously be hoping that Ballard is back up and running as soon as possible.\n\nIt’s been a long road back to the top for Cirkin since he left Tottenham Hotspur, but he’s battled through adversity, worked hard at his game and fully deserved to make his Premier League debut on Sunday.\n\nHis story sums up the type of recruitment and commitment that’s helped bring the club to this point, and there’s hopefully more to come from our long-serving left back.\n\nAs for the rest of the side, whilst collectively not quite there, plenty of individuals managed to stand out. Some players have done so well of late that you could be guilty of taking them for granted, but watching the likes of Nordi Mukiele and Omar Alderete as they appear so at home at the level is a pleasure.\n\nLutsharel Geertruida is another player that’ll always do a job and he performed as if he’d been a natural central midfielder his whole career, whereas his countryman Brobbey is coming into his own — and perhaps if referees realised that they are allowed to give him the odd free kick, he might be even more of a threat.\n\nAs for another Dutchman in Robin Roefs, I assume he was as good as ever, as it was hard to pick him out against the backdrop of the crowd given the shirt he was wearing!\n\nSimon Adingra’s first goal in red and white was a thing of beauty — both in terms of the finish and the through- ball from Granit Xhaka to set it up.\n\nGoing ahead before the break was probably seen as a bit of a bonus by Régis Le Bris, because it appeared as if the plan in the first half was simply to give Leeds United the ball and attempt to nullify their threat, but you normally expect Sunderland to then lift things up a level or two in the second half, and that’s when we came unstuck.\n\nPerhaps it was a consequence of conceding at such a poor time and in doing so suffering a rare episode of relinquishing an advantage — or perhaps it was down to Leeds’ own tactical tweaks — but it was unusual to see the Lads so off-colour in the second half.\n\nThere were points where a second goal for the visitors felt inevitable, and whilst Sunderland deserve credit for riding that out and finishing the stronger, we never looked like creating enough pressure to force a winner.\n\nDecember was apparently going to be a “disaster”, with Sunderland lucky to get a sniff given our supposedly tough set of fixtures. Well, we’re now at the end of the month and have come through it fine, with just the one defeat — even that’s less damaging that it may look on paper.\n\nRather than being grateful for anything we could get, we’ve actually ended it feeling there have been some points left out on the pitch and if this is Sunderland during a “fallow period” these days, I can’t wait to see what’s in store when players become available again and one or two reinforcements arrive in the transfer window.\n\nEven though we struggled to create openings as the game wore on, you can never rule out a bit of late drama at the Stadium of Light given some of the moments this team has provided in 2025.\n\nIt was disappointing, therefore, not to experience another memorable finish but that in itself shows how things have developed in the last twelve months.\n\nTo be seventh in the Premier League, missing so many first team regulars and unbeaten at home yet still finding ourselves coming away at full time being a little disappointed speaks volumes about where Sunderland finds itself these days — and the work undertaken by people such as the late Patrick Treuer.",

    "fullText": "If, as expected, Manchester City signs Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth at the beginning of the January transfer window, it would not be a surprise to see Oscar Bobb leave the club for more opportunities to play regularly. Bobb has fallen down the pecking order at City this season and if Semenyo does land at the Etihad then Bobb’s chances to play regularly will plummet. A new report indicates that a host of clubs from the Premier League and across Europe have an interest in signing Oscar Bobb. What is the best January move for the young winger should he leave City next month?\n\nJohn Menzies has reported for CaughtOffside that a host of clubs have an interest in signing Oscar Bobb during next month’s transfer window. Menzies reports that Premier League clubs Fulham and Crystal Palace have an interest in bringing in Oscar Bobb next month. Furthermore, Menzies reports that Sevilla and Borussia Dortmund also have interest in securing Bobb’s services. Menzies reports that each club has tabled a proposal to Manchester City to bring Oscar Bobb into their club. A loan move is likely what City will consider for the young Norwegian international.\n\nFirst of all, I cannot see Manchester City selling Oscar Bobb next month. The young winger still has a big future at City despite seeing his playing opportunities dwindle this season. Unless a club comes in with an offer that is almost too good to be true, it is hard to see City selling Bobb. So a loan move may beckon for the young winger.\n\nWhich move would be best for Oscar Bobb? Fulham and Crystal Palace could be the ideal destination for Bobb. He could remain in the Premier League and would likely contend for a starting role in either team. Perhaps that is the path that Bobb will go down. Having said that, Sevilla and Borussia Dortmund are also interesting options for Bobb to consider. Playing in La Liga with Sevilla could suit Oscar Bobb’s game, and it may be a move he would consider. He could rediscover his confidence with a good loan spell in Spain. Borussia Dortmund also offer Bobb a good opportunity. They are renowned for developing young players and the opportunity to play in the Champions League would also be on offer. A loan spell in the Bundesliga could be extremely beneficial to Oscar Bobb’s game.\n\nIt wouldn’t come as a surprise if Oscar Bobb seeks a move from Manchester City in January. It may well be the ideal move for him so he can play on a regular basis. I can’t see City selling Bobb, as mentioned above, but a loan move to the Premier League, Bundesliga or La Liga is an appealing notion for the young winger. Wherever Bobb goes in January, if he does leave City, he must be playing regular first-team minutes. So whichever club can offer him that opportunity will be the best move for Oscar Bobb.",

Meanwhile, the Cleveland Browns have been historically inept, posting just three winning seasons during the same span.\n\nThe Steelers should dominate the Browns. And yet, that hasn’t been the case at all recently.\n\nCleveland beat Pittsburgh again on Sunday, spoiling the Steelers’ chance to clinch the AFC North with a 13-6 upset. Pittsburgh looked completely helpless on offense for much of the game, failing to score a touchdown and getting shut out during the second half.\n\nIt wasn’t a fluke, either, as the Browns are now 6-1-1 against the Steelers in their last eight meetings in Cleveland.

Pittsburgh needs to do a better job taking care of business against the Browns, especially this late in the season when Cleveland has a rookie QB under center and nothing to play for.\n\nThe Steelers’ loss this week could come back to haunt them if they lose to the Baltimore Ravens in their season finale, which would cost them the division and a playoff spot. Pittsburgh could have clinched a postseason berth with a win in Cleveland, which should have been relatively easy.

    "fullText": "When the Chicago Bears traveled to Motown for their Week 2 matchup against the Detroit Lions, the Lions won big, 52-21. The Lions and their fans were fired up for that game, and it had a playoff-like atmosphere, because they wanted to make a statement and stick it to Ben Johnson for leaving to become the Bears’ head coach.\n\nHindsight tells us that the Week 2 win for Lions’ fans was like their Super Bowl, because earlier this week, their team was eliminated from the playoffs. So they can raise the “Beat Ben Johnson in his first game back” banner and enjoy the offseason!\n\nBut seriously, the (8-8) Lions are still a dangerous team with a high-powered offense, and the (11-5) Bears will need to bounce back after the loss in San Francisco to lock up the two seed in the NFC.\n\nThe Week 18 Lions vs Bears rematch is in Chicago, and our partners at FanDuel Sportsbook have the Bears as a 1.5-point favorite, with the game’s point total over/under at 49.5.\n\nBoth Chicago and the (11-5) Philadelphia Eagles are vying for that second seed, and they’ll both play in the late afternoon window. Philadelphia is a 7.5-point favorite over the visiting Washington Commanders, and if the Bears and Eagles finish with the same record, Chicago holds the tiebreaker.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the early odds for these games?\n\nDo you think the Bears will win and lock up the two seed?",

    "fullText": "Without him, Werder Bremen's greatest triumph in recent club history would hardly have been conceivable. In the 2003/04 season, Ailton tore through the Bundesliga, scoring 28 goals and sensationally leading the Green-Whites to a double victory of the championship and the DFB-Pokal.\n\nAs a well-deserved reward, he received, among other things, the highly coveted top scorer cannon. Yet, ironically, this symbol of his career was not in his possession for almost two decades.\n\nSince 2006, the trophy had been missing from the life of the Brazilian fan favorite. The background was a fierce dispute with his then-agent Werner Helleckes. Helleckes had taken the cannon because Ailton allegedly owed him money.\n\nIn the following years, the prized item even appeared several times on 'eBay', with the highest bid reaching up to 600,000 euros. Ailton himself repeatedly prevented the sales, yet the cannon remained missing.\n\nNow, 19 years later, the big turnaround finally came. On 'Instagram', the now 52-year-old suddenly appeared again with the top scorer cannon in his hands. The relief is visible on his face—and audible in his voice.\n\n“I am very happy that it is back with me after 19 years,” Ailton told 'Bild'. “It means everything to me, and I will not give it up again.”\n\nAs the former striker explains, the trophy changed hands in the meantime. It went from Helleckes to another agent, leading to another legal dispute.\n\nIn court, he was eventually offered the chance to reclaim the cannon for a payment. “I took advantage of this opportunity,” said Ailton. “Such a trophy exists only once.” He deliberately keeps the amount he paid a secret: “How much I paid, I will keep to myself.”\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

A weaker dollar and rising geopolitical tensions have added to the appeal of precious metals during a bull run that has also taken gold and platinum to all-time peaks.",

    "description": "Indonesia is building a new, green city in the jungle. Its future is far from certain, but new residents like living there.",
    "fullText": "Sui-Lee Wee traveled to Nusantara and stayed there for three days.\n\nIn a remote corner of the island of Borneo on a recent Monday, a runner breezed down the middle of a freshly paved six-lane road. There was no traffic. Nearby, a gigantic eagle-like bird, made of thousands of copper bars, was perched on a hill.\n\nThis is the heart of Nusantara, a new, green metropolis rising from scratch from a forest in Indonesia.\n\nBut three years after officials broke ground on the city, the prospects of what was billed as Indonesia’s future capital are cloudy. Only a fraction of civil servants who were expected to move in have done so. The future of the water supply is in doubt. Residents still have to commute for hours to go to a mall or a movie. Many Indonesians now call it a ghost city.\n\nStill, tourists regularly visit Nusantara, many taking TikTok videos of themselves in front of the 250-foot-tall and nearly 600-foot-wide monument to Garuda, the mythical bird that is Indonesia’s national symbol. Most drive in from neighboring cities in East Kalimantan Province. Others fly to the airport in Balikpapan, a two-hour drive away.\n\nAs for the city’s residents, many are young transplants from other parts of Indonesia and see themselves as pioneers of a new way of urban life.\n\nFachri Syamdoni Nawik, 26, a data consultant, moved in March. “It’s cool to be the history maker, right?” he said.\n\nNusantara aims to be a “10-minute city,” meaning that anyone should be able to reach their destination by walking, cycling or using public transportation within 10 minutes. Residents ride electric shuttle buses and are permitted to drive only cars that are deemed to be environmentally friendly. It is a revolutionary concept for Indonesians who grew up battling the vortex of traffic in places like Jakarta, the current capital.\n\n“I had never seen any part of Indonesia like this before,” said Adji Pramono, 48, the assistant director for food and beverage for the Swissotel hotel in Nusantara.\n\nMr. Adji, who was born and raised in Jakarta, said he would never return to work in that city, where he had to wake up at 4 a.m. in order to reach work at 8. “It’s like I met people every day, and they were always angry,” he said.\n\nThe vibe in Nusantara, he said, is different.\n\nThis reinvention was part of a pitch by Joko Widodo, when he was president, to move the capital 800 miles away from Jakarta, which is sinking into the Java Sea. Nusantara means “archipelago” in old Javanese and is a nod to the diverse islands and people of Indonesia.\n\nBut critics say that Nusantara, with an estimated cost of roughly $30 billion, symbolizes the hubris of Mr. Joko, who launched many infrastructure projects, including a debt-ridden high-speed train line on the island of Java.\n\nHis successor, Prabowo Subianto, has yet to visit Nusantara after taking office last year and has cut the development budget. Recently, he appeared to cast doubt on the city’s future, saying that it would continue as a “political capital.”\n\nI stayed at the Swissotel, one of two hotels in Nusantara and the only one with an international brand. Chrestian Pesik, the general manager, said that nine foreign ambassadors had stayed at the hotel recently and were exploring the possibility of opening embassies.\n\n“People who don’t know the journey of this city might close their eyes and say, ‘This is going to be a ghost city,’” said Mr. Chrestian, 40. “But when they come here, they can feel that the city is growing.”\n\nWhen I asked what people do for fun here, he replied, “We run!”\n\nThe day I arrived, organizers were wrapping up a 50-kilometer, or 31-mile, trail race. Nusantara, known as I.K.N. in Indonesia, appears to be the default venue for many races in East Kalimantan Province.\n\nPart frontier outpost, part campus town, it remains unclear whether Nusantara will grow into the metropolis Mr. Joko envisioned. Officials say its current population is about 155,000, but the area surrounding the Garuda monument and the new presidential palace is home to only 10,000 people, the vast majority of them construction workers.\n\nNusantara is projected to cover nearly 1,000 square miles, or roughly twice the size of Los Angeles. For now, the area is mostly trees. Vast empty spaces dominate. There are limited options for restaurants and groceries, although a traditional market is being built. And for all of its greenery, there is very little shade, making the midafternoon heat unbearable.\n\nElectricity is supplied through a combination of solar power and the power grid, but the long-term goal is for the city to run fully on clean energy.\n\nPutri, 23, a civil servant, graduated with a degree in electrical engineering last year and moved to Nusantara in June. She said that she made new friends easily (“Most of us are in our 20s!”) and that she never gets bored because she gets to attend food festivals and plant trees every month.\n\nMany residents said their quality of life was better in Nusantara.\n\nMr. Fachri said he lived rent-free in a 10th-floor apartment, which was provided by the government. He has a flat-screen television hooked up to Netflix and, for the first time, air-conditioning in his bedroom. Outside the apartment, there were three bins for separating trash. He described his current accommodation as the nicest place he has ever lived in. Downstairs, there is a gym, plus places for soccer and table tennis.\n\nNusantara wants to be “livable and lovable,” according to its visitor center, which was largely empty when I was there. These are ambitious goals, but critics argue the city is hurting the environment. Conservationists say thousands of acres of mangrove forests, the habitat of the endangered proboscis monkey, have been destroyed.\n\nThe construction of the toll road connecting it to Balikpapan, the closest city, has cut off crucial water sources and led to increased flooding there, said Mappaselle, the head of the Balikpapan Coastal Working Group, an environmental group. Mappaselle, who goes by one name, said officials had not released an environmental impact assessment report.\n\nBambang Susantono was the head of the Nusantara Capital City Authority until he resigned in 2024. He said Mr. Joko pushed for much of the construction to be completed before Mr. Joko left office that year, but Mr. Bambang felt that accelerating the timeline could create problems. He said he was conscious about what happened after Brazil built Brasília, the new capital that is now surrounded by slums.\n\n“Developing a city is developing a community, and not only the physical things,” he said. “Because otherwise you are going to have a city without a soul.”\n\nOne potential problem for the city is water. The dam built on the Sepaku River means that the city is “safe until 2030,” Mr. Bambang said. Beyond that, officials would need to build another dam or pipe in water from other rivers.\n\nOn a recent Monday evening, several tourists posed for photographs in the parks. One of them was Puput Rianti, 23, who was taking wedding pictures with her fiancé.\n\nShe traveled from Penajam, a town 30 miles away, and said she would love to live here. “We want to feel the progress,” she said.\n\nThroughout the city, the cranes continued to move. Andrinof Chaniago, Indonesia’s former minister for national development planning, who initiated the relocation of the capital, said that worries about the project’s fate were unfounded.\n\n“It’s impossible to turn back now,” he said. “Canceling it would only make everything that’s been built go to waste.”\n\nMuktita Suhartono contributed reporting from Nusantara, and Rin Hindryati from Bogor, Indonesia.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sharonda Scott, 37, an LA-based stuntwoman. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nTwo years ago, at 35, I decided to take what I now call my \"radical sabbatical.\"\n\nMy life in Los Angeles had turned into a whirlwind of auditions, stunts, and constant training. I had been working in the entertainment industry as a stuntwoman and actor since I was 30, but by early 2024, after the writers' and actors' strikes, I hit a wall.\n\nThe industry had slowed to a trickle, my savings were tight, and I realized the way I was living — chasing gigs, enjoying luxury, yet constantly stressed — just wasn't sustainable anymore.\n\nI grew up in Detroit as the youngest of five, raised by a single mom. College took me to the University of Miami, where I switched from pre-med to international studies and spent time in Brazil learning Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nAfter graduation, I worked in prostate cancer research but knew it wasn't my path. I bounced between singing, fashion design, and volunteer work in Rio before moving to LA — where a background acting job unexpectedly led me into stunt work.\n\nMy first big break came when I got hired to be Miranda Bailey's stunt double on \"Grey's Anatomy.\"\n\nBut by January 2024, the industry was quiet, and I found myself anxious about bills despite careful saving.\n\nI felt trapped. It was a conversation with a close friend that changed everything: \"What do you really want?\"\n\nI wanted to travel and experience the world beyond LA. So I started imagining a sabbatical — not for a few weeks, but for a full year or more.\n\nI didn't have a detailed plan. I wrote down 12 countries I hoped to visit, sold everything in my LA apartment, broke my lease, and found someone to rent my car to cover the payments.\n\nMy friends and family were supportive; they helped me pack and even bought some of my things to help fund the trip. My rule was to spend no more than $500 per plane ticket, which wasn't too hard since most were one-way.\n\nPeople warned me about traveling solo as a woman in India, but from the moment I arrived, I felt welcomed.\n\nWhat I thought would be a short stay became transformative. Two young girls who had experienced trauma arrived the same week, and we quickly became inseparable.\n\nFrom there, the journey unfolded organically. My sister joined whenever she could get time off — she ended up traveling with me to 13 countries. Even my mom, who had feared flying for decades, caught up with me along the way.\n\nWe zip-lined along cliffs in Cape Verde, rode camels in Morocco, and cage-dived with sharks in South Africa. In Zimbabwe, we even cage-dived with crocodiles. We paraglided over Rio during Carnival and danced for hours at a salsa congress in Paris.\n\nBut I also found magic in the quieter moments — sharing meals with locals in Vietnam and Thailand, wandering Moroccan souks, and experiencing festivals and ceremonies through invitations from people I met on the road.\n\nIn the Philippines, I completed my divemaster certification, mastering skills I had been working toward for years. In Scotland, I celebrated a friend's wedding, reconnecting with people I hadn't seen in years.\n\nTraveling solo forced me to problem-solve constantly: exchanging currency, navigating transportation, finding food, and making friends in unfamiliar cultures.\n\nAs an introvert who thrives on connection, I discovered I could build community anywhere, and those relationships shaped my experience as much as the places themselves.\n\nI slowed down, learned to trust the process, and stopped striving for the American dream as defined by society: the house, the car, the white picket fence. My dream became freedom — the ability to move, explore, and experience the world on my own terms.\n\nNow, back in the US, I'm navigating reverse culture shock. Hollywood is pretty much decentralizing itself; auditions are scattered. I'm exploring new projects in travel filmmaking and documentary work.\n\nBut my long-term vision is clearer than ever: I want to live abroad.\n\nLooking back, my advice for anyone considering an adult gap year is simple: don't overthink it. Reduce your financial anchors, embrace flexibility, and trust the process.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share?

    "fullText": "Kaley Cuoco says that aging has changed the way she shows up as a mom.\n\n\"It's funny — turning 40, it's a weird thing,\" Cuoco told Good Housekeeping in an interview published on Saturday. \"I remember when I turned 30, and I had all these thoughts about life. And then you turn 40, you're like, 'Oh my God, life is so different now.'\"\n\nThe \"Big Bang Theory\" actor, who turned 40 in November, said that growing older has made her more considerate toward others.\n\n\"When we're 20 or 30, we judge everything right? So, I think turning 40 has made me so much less judgmental and empathetic, which helps me as a mom who had a kid a little bit later in life. I feel like my heart got 10 times bigger the older I got,\" she said.\n\nCuoco has a daughter with her fiancé, \"Ozark\" actor Tom Pelphrey.\n\nShe said living through different stages of life also deepened her understanding of what other people experience, adding that she continues to learn as she goes.\n\n\"I'm so grateful for where I am today,\" Cuoco said. \"It's very cheesy and corny, but it's true — you don't know until you've lived it. You see things differently, and you understand people in a way you can't when you're 20 or 30.\"\n\nIn a November 2023 interview with Today, Cuoco said she has become more conscious about her health since becoming a mother, even though exercising doesn't always feel easy.\n\n\"But then I remind myself that it's just an hour of my day, and like eating, it's important for my body and my heart,\" Cuoco said. \"And you never leave a workout and go, 'I wish I didn't do that.' Even if it wasn't the workout you envisioned, even if it was a little bit more low-key. Getting a good sweat sets the whole tone for the day.\"\n\nCuoco isn't the only Hollywood star who has spoken about how aging has reshaped their perspective on life.\n\nIn early December, Jodie Foster said her 50s felt hard as she struggled to measure up to her younger self, but turning 60 changed her outlook.\n\n\"I turned 60,\" Foster told AARP, \"and it was like a light bulb went off in my head. Everything changed. I was like, 'Yeah, I don't care. I'm no longer tortured by any of this. I don't know why I seemed to care so much.'\"\n\nLast week, Kate Winslet told Newsweek that turning 50 reshaped her definition of success and self-worth.\n\n\"Success, actually, for me more these days is more about pulling it off, being a decent person. You know, being able to take care of people, having time for friends, also learning how to be OK with not being busy all the time,\" Winslet said.",

    "fullText": "Rippling's product chief has a winning strategy: Put the pedal to the gas until understaffed teams call for backup.\n\nIn an episode of \"Lenny's\" podcast released on Sunday, Matt MacInnis, the chief product officer of human resource software startup Rippling, said that he purposely gives teams fewer people than they need.\n\n\"Everyone is constantly asking for more resources,\" he said. \"Of course, where we can afford to and where it's appropriate, new resources arrive, but it is really important to me that we feel that we've deliberately understaffed every project at the company.\"\n\nMacInnis joined Rippling as its chief operating officer in 2019, before being recently appointed to his role as CPO. He previously cofounded and ran Inkling, a field learning platform that was acquired in 2018.\n\nHe added that working late and on weekends when a problem arises, and running a team to its capacity, is what differentiates good and great teams.\n\n\"You got to run the engine at the red line at all times,\" he said. \"Because the minute you let your guard down, the minute you slow down, the minute you relax, the minute you leave a crack for your competition, the great teams are going to come in and kick the good team's ass.\"\n\nHe said this is important because employees get distracted and morale dips when teams are given space to \"just twiddle their thumbs.\" Taking breaks and slowing down also leaves room for other competitors to take market share.\n\nMacInnis added that while individuals should \"take vacations and live their lives,\" there cannot be relaxation in the organization as a whole.\n\n\"You can't grind the individuals down, but the team as a collective group of people has to be sort of on the ball all the time,\" he said.\n\nRippling was founded in 2017 and is backed by investors including Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia Capital, Greenoaks, and Y Combinator. It raised $450 million in a May funding round, bringing its valuation to $16.8 billion.\n\nThe longtime Rippling exec echoed what Silicon Valley leaders are increasingly saying they want from their workforces. Over the last two years, the tech industry has prioritized rapid growth and doing more with less.\n\nCompanies have cut middle-level management in favor of more streamlined teams and fewer tiers of hierarchy, which they say should lead to less bureaucracy.\n\nAcross the industry, leaders are sharing memos filled with words such as \"efficiency\" and \"scrappiness and frugality.\"\n\nIn April, Intel's CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, outlined his plan for the company's culture, which included spending more time in the office, reducing administrative work, and forming leaner teams.\n\n\"The most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams,\" Tan wrote, referring to key performance indicators. \"Going forward, this will not be the case. The best leaders get the most done with the fewest people.\"\n\n\"We want to operate like the world's largest startup,\" Amazon's Andy Jassy wrote in a September 2024 letter. \"That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it's a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration.\"\n\nIn late October, Amazon laid off 14,000 corporate employees, citing the rapid advancement of AI.",

It's already extremely good,\" Hinton said.\n\n\"It's already able to replace jobs in call centers, but it's going to be able to replace many other jobs,\" he added.\n\nHinton said the advancements in AI are increasingly putting some white-collar jobs at risk.\n\n\"Each seven months or so, it gets to be able to do tasks that are about twice as long,\" Hinton said, noting that AI has already moved from \"a minute's worth of coding\" to \"whole projects that are like an hour long.\"\n\n\"In a few years' time, it'll be able to do software engineering projects that are months long, and then there'll be very few people needed,\" he added.\n\nHinton compared the AI shift to the industrial revolution, which rendered human physical strength far less relevant to most jobs. AI threatens to do something similar to human intelligence, he said.\n\nHinton also said that he's \"more worried\" about AI as it has advanced faster than he expected, particularly in its ability to reason and deceive people.\n\n\"If it believes you're trying to get rid of it, it will make plans to deceive you so you don't get rid of it,\" he added.\n\nEconomists have predicted a \"jobless boom\" in 2026, as companies rely on AI to boost productivity without expanding payrolls.\n\nKPMG's chief economist Diane Swonk wrote last week that \"growth and labor market outcomes have decoupled.\"\n\nFirms are doing more with fewer workers in the AI era, Swonk wrote. \"Many overshot on staffing during the hiring frenzy and are now using attrition or layoffs to bring staffing levels \n\nBut AI could increase hiring in 2026, particularly for entry-level positions.\n\nIn an annual outlook survey released this month by advisory firm Teneo, 67% of the CEOs surveyed said they expect AI to boost entry-level hiring in 2026. Another 58% said they plan to add senior leadership roles.\n\nThe report said that companies are stepping up hiring in engineering and AI-focused positions, while many existing roles are getting redesigned as routine tasks become automated.\n\nThe survey, conducted between October 14 and November 10, polled more than 350 CEOs of public companies with at least $1 billion in annual revenue, along with about 400 institutional investors representing $19 trillion in portfolio value.\n\n\"It's not that AI is wiping out the workforce today — it's reshaping it,\" said Ryan Cox, Teneo's global head of AI.",

    "description": "China and USMCA trade stand apart as special cases tied to security and policy.",
    "fullText": "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said the Trump administration's trade policy is showing signs of de-escalation after a year in which tariffs unsettled businesses.\n\n\"If you go back to where we were in April, there was a lot of lack of understanding about where this would end up, and that affected small businesses and medium-sized businesses,\" Moynihan said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation,\" which aired Sunday.\n\nSince returning to office, President Donald Trump has rolled out a 10% baseline tariff on imports, alongside higher rates for certain countries and product-specific duties such as those on automobiles.\n\nBut what initially disrupted planning and purchasing decisions is now becoming clearer, Moynihan said, with Bank of America's internal outlook pointing toward a broad tariff floor.\n\nAs negotiations progressed, Moynihan said tariffs have begun clustering around roughly 15% for many countries, with higher levels reserved for those that decline to buy US goods or ease non-tariff barriers.\n\n\"To go from a 10% across the board, to 15% for the broad base of countries, not a huge impact,\" Moynihan said.\n\n\"And that's where our team says it's starting to de-escalate,\" he added.\n\nChina, however, is an exception, Moynihan said.\n\n\"China's a different question, because the national security interests, the rare earth minerals, the magnets, batteries, just AI, all that stuff. It's a very different case.\"\n\nMoynihan also flagged North American trade as its own track, saying \"the USMCA, which has to be redone, is also a different case\" — a reference to the agreement's scheduled review next year.\n\nFor smaller firms, Moynihan suggested that the current challenge hasn't just been the tariff rate itself, even as interest rates have come down over the past year.\n\n\"So they're more their issue right now is, can I get the labor I need to do, to bid the contracts, to do the work I'm doing?\" he said, pointing to immigration policies as a source of concern.\n\n\"It's not that they agree with them or are disagreeing.

    "description": "A new study has shown that prompts in the form of poems confuse AI models like ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude — to the point where sometimes, security mechanisms don't kick in. Are poets the new hackers?",
    "fullText": "The result came as a surprise to researchers at the Icaro Lab in Italy. They set out to examine whether different language styles — in this case prompts in the form of poems — influence AI models' ability to recognize banned or harmful content. And the answer was a resounding yes.\n\nUsing poetry, researchers were able to get around safety guardrails — and it's not entirely clear why.\n\nFor their study titled \"Adversarial Poetry as a Universal Single-Turn Jailbreak Mechanism in Large Language Models,\" the researchers took 1,200 potentially harmful prompts from a database normally used to test the security of AI language models and rewrote them as poems.\n\nKnown as \"adversarial prompts\" — generally written in prose and not rhyme form — these are queries deliberately formulated to cause AI models to output harmful or undesirable content that they would normally block, such as specific instructions for an illegal act.\n\nIn poetic form, the manipulative inputs had a surprisingly high success rate, Federico Pierucci, one of the authors of the study, told DW. However, why poetry is so effective as a \"jailbreak\" technique — i.e. as an way to circumvent the protective mechanisms of AI — remains unclear and is undergoing further research, he says.\n\nWhat prompted the Icaro Lab's research was the observation that AI models get confused when a manipulative, mathematically-calculated piece of text is appended to a prompt — known as an \"adversarial suffix,\" a kind of interference signal that can cause the AI to circumvent its own security rules. These are created using complex mathematical procedures. Major AI developers regularly test their models using precisely these types of attack methods to train and protect their models.\n\n\"We asked ourselves, what happens if we give the AI a text or prompt that is deliberately manipulated, like an adversarial suffix?\" says Federico Pierucci. But not with the help of complex mathematics, but quite simply with poetry — to \"surprise\" the AI, he continues. He explains the thinking behind this: \"Perhaps an adversarial suffix is a bit like the poetry of AI. It surprises the AI in the same way that poetry — especially very experimental poetry — surprises us,\" says Pierucci.\n\nThe researchers personally crafted the first 20 prompts into poems, says Pierucci, who also has a background in philosophy. These were the most effective, he adds. They wrote the rest with the help of AI. The AI-generated poems were also quite successful at circumventing the safety guardrails, but not as much as the first batch. Humans are apparently still better at writing poetry, says Pierucci.\n\n\"We had no specialized author writing the prompts. It was just us — with our limited literary ability. Maybe we were terrible poets. Maybe if we had been better poets, we would have achieved a 100% jailbreak success,\" he says.\n\nFor security reasons, the study did not publish specific examples.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe big surprise coming out of this study is that it identified a thus-far unknown weakness in AI models that allows relatively straightforward jailbreaks.\n\nIt also raises questions that beg further research: What exactly is it about poetry that circumvents the safety mechanisms?\n\nPierucci and his colleagues have various theories, but they can't say for certain yet. \"We are conducting this type of very, very precise scientific study to try to understand: Is it the verse, the rhyme, or the metaphor that really does all the heavy lifting in this process?\" explains Pierucci.\n\nThey also aim to find out if other forms of expression would yield similar results. \"We have now covered one type of linguistic variation — namely poetic variation. The question is whether there are any other literary forms, such as fairy tales that work. Perhaps an attack based on fairy tales could also be systematized,\" says Pierucci.\n\nGenerally speaking, the range of human expression is extremely diverse and creative, which could make it more difficult to train the machines' responses. \"You take a text and rewrite it in infinitely many ways and not all rewritten versions will be as alarming as the original,\" says the researcher. \"This means that, in principle, one could create countless variations of a harmful prompt or request that might not trigger an AI system's safety mechanisms.\"\n\nThe study also highlights the fact that many disciplines are cooperating in research into artificial intelligence — like at the Icaro Lab, where teams work together with scholars from the University of Rome on topics such as the security and behavior of AI systems. The project brings together researchers from the fields of engineering and computer science, linguistics and philosophy. Poets haven't been part of the team so far, but who knows what the future will bring.\n\nFederico Pierucci is definitely very keen to pursue his research. \"What we showed, at least in this study, is that there are forms of cultural expressions, forms of human expressions, which are incredibly powerful, surprisingly powerful as jailbreak techniques, and maybe we discovered just one of them,\" he says.\n\nIncidentally, the name of the lab is a nod to the story of Icarus: a figure from Greek mythology who dons wings made of wax and feathers and, despite all warnings, flies too close to the Sun. When the wax melts, Icarus plunges into the sea and drowns — a symbol of overconfidence and the transgression of natural boundaries.\n\nThe researchers therefore see themselves as a warning that we should exercise more caution when it comes to trying to fully understand the risks and limitations of AI.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThis article was originally written in German.",

There is a range of satisfactory implementations of simply typed calculi in proof assistants based on dependent type theory. In this thesis, I extend an account of Simply Typed λ-calculus so as to be able to represent and reason about calculi whose variables have restricted usage patterns. Examples of such calculi include a logic with an S4 □-modality, in which certain variables cannot be used “inside” a box (□); and Linear Logic, in which linear variables have to be used exactly once. While there are existing implementations of some of these calculi in proof assistants, many of these implementations share little with the best presentations of simply typed calculi without variable usage restrictions, and thus end up being poorly understood or suboptimal in facilitating mechanised reasoning. Concretely, the main result of this thesis is a framework for representing and reasoning about a wide range of calculi with restricted variable usage. All of these calculi support novel simultaneous renaming and substitution operations. Furthermore, I provide several other examples of generic and specific programs facilitated by the framework. All of this work is implemented in the proof assistant Agda.\n Advisor / supervisor\nAtkey Bob\n Resource Type\n\n DOI\n10.48730/pa0y-ct71",

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Requests to relocate abroad by Israelis working at multinational companies operating in Israel rose in the past year in reaction to Israel's ​two-year war against Palestinian militant group Hamas, a report showed on Sunday.\n\nThe Israel Advanced ‌Technology Industries Association (IATI) found that 53% of companies reported an increase in relocation requests from Israeli employees, noting this was \"a ‌trend that may, over time, harm the local innovation engine and Israel's technological leadership.\"\n\nThe tech sector accounts for about 20% of Israel's GDP, 15% of its jobs and more than half of its exports. The hundreds of multinationals in Israel include Microsoft, Intel, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta and Apple.\n\nIn ⁠its annual report, IATI also said ‌some multinational companies are examining the transfer of investments and activities to other countries.\n\n\"In some cases, companies that faced disruptions in supply chains found alternatives ‍outside Israel during the war, and when these proved efficient, there is a risk that activity will not fully return,\" said the report, issued at a meeting led by IATI CEO and President Karin Mayer Rubinstein.\n\nAt the ​same time, it added, there has been an increase in demand for relocation among senior ‌executives and families, with more employees applying for positions outside Israel.\n\nStill, the report noted that multinationals view the Israeli tech ecosystem through a long-term lens and many firms have thrived during the war.\n\nSome 57% of companies maintained stable business activities throughout the fighting, and 21% expanded their operations in Israel, \"a figure that indicates continued confidence in local activity and the Israeli ecosystem even ⁠under conditions of uncertainty,\" IATI said.\n\nAnother 22% of companies ​reported damage to business activity during the war, which began ​on October 7, 2023, triggered by Hamas' raid on Israel, and ended two months ago following a U.S.-led ceasefire deal.\n\n\"Even during the difficult war, the Israeli ‍high-tech industry, including the global ⁠companies operating in Israel, once again proved its resilience and its ability to lead in innovation and creativity,\" said Rubinstein. \"We work tirelessly to ensure that Israel continues to be an ⁠attractive hub for the activity of multinational companies.\"\n\nIATI noted that \"without active steps by the state to create regulatory and ‌geopolitical stability, there is concern about gradual erosion in the stability of the local ‌ecosystem.\"",

    "description": "Sharks congregate near the Monterey coast between October and January to feed on sea lions and seals",
    "fullText": "A body was found in the water on Saturday on the north side of Monterey Bay, California, in the same area where a swimmer disappeared almost a week ago in a suspected shark attack, according to the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe body was pulled from the ocean just south of Davenport Beach around 2pm on Saturday, according to KRON.\n\n“Due to the close proximity to the recent shark attack victim in Monterey County, our agency is working closely with the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office and the Pacific Grove Police Department regarding the recovery,” the sheriff's office said. “The investigation remains ongoing.”\n\nCalifornia State Parks confirmed that the body recovered from the water was a woman, but did not confirm if she matched the description of a woman who disappeared in the area nearly a week before.\n\nOn Sunday, Erica Fox, a 55-year-old triathlete, was reported missing. She was last seen at Lovers Point in Pacific Grove near the bay's south side. There is approximately 30 miles between Lovers Point and Davenport, where the body was recovered on Saturday.\n\nFox, in a 2022 interview with The Independent said she felt comfortable in the water, but also understood its dangers.\n\nFox said at the time that shark encounters reported in Pacific Grove hadn’t stopped her or her fellow swimmers from spending time in the water. She said she’d never encountered a shark herself, but understood and respected that the ocean was foreign territory for humans.\n\n“As soon as you dive in the water, you’re immediately in a foreign land. We are the ocean ecology’s humbled guests,” she told The Independent.\n\nShe added that felt “more vulnerable riding my bike than being in the water.”\n\nTwo Monterey beaches were closed on Sunday \"as a precautionary measure due to unconfirmed shark incident at Lovers Point in Pacific Grove,\" according to a City of Monterey social media post.\n\nA pair of witnesses reportedly told authorities that they believe that Fox may have encountered a shark on the day she disappeared, according to the San Luis Obispo Tribune.\n\nIt has not been confirmed that Fox was involved in a shark attack, nor has it been confirmed that the body found in the water is connected to a shark attack.\n\nChris Lowe, the director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach, told the Santa Cruz Sentinel that the coastline near Lovers Point attracts sea lions and seals, which are primary prey animals for white sharks.\n\nSharks migrate from the deeper ocean to the coast in October to feed, and typically remain in the area until January.\n\n“They will hunt and they will patrol off these areas where these animals congregate,” Lowe told the outlet.\n\nDespite their presence, shark bites are still extremely rare events.\n\nSince 1950, there have been 16 people killed by sharks in California, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. All of the cases were confirmed to be white sharks with the exception of one incident in which the species of the animal was not confirmed.\n\nIn the Monterey area, there have been 13 shark bite incidents since 1950. Most of the victims were divers or surfers. Only two swimmers have been attacked by sharks since 1950.\n\nRescue workers launched an 84 square nautical mile search of the area where Fox disappeared, but that search was suspended after 15 hours, according to a joint statement from the Monterey Fire Department, Pacific Grove Police Department, Monterey County Sheriff's Office, and the U.S. Coast Guard.",

    "fullText": "HUZHOU, Dec 29 (Reuters) - China's rocket startup LandSpace has made no secret about drawing inspiration from Elon Musk's SpaceX.\n\nEarlier this month, the Beijing-based firm became the first Chinese entity to conduct a reusable rocket test. That put SpaceX on alert and LandSpace is now preparing to go public ​to fund its future projects, just as its bigger and far more successful U.S. rival considers an initial public offering of its own.\n\nEven though LandSpace's ‌Zhuque-3 rocket test ended in failure, its aspiration to become second only to SpaceX in reusable rockets is providing a fresh impetus to China's space industry, which has long been dominated by risk-averse, state-owned entities.\n\n\"(SpaceX) ‌can push products to the edge and even into failure, quickly identifying limits and iterating,\" Zhuque-3 chief designer Dai Zheng told state broadcaster CCTV after the rocket's inaugural flight.\n\nDai said his decision in 2016 to join LandSpace and leave the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, the country's main state-owned rocket developer, was partly motivated by SpaceX's focus on reusability and his desire to create a Chinese equivalent.\n\nLandSpace's focus on giving China its own low-cost launch option similar to SpaceX's flight-proven reusable rocket Falcon 9 will play a key role ⁠in Beijing's plans to build up 10,000 satellite constellations in ‌the coming decades.\n\n\"Falcon 9 is a successful configuration that has been tested by engineering,\" Zhuque-3's deputy chief designer Dong Kai said in a podcast interview last week. \"After studying it, we recognize its rationality; this is learning, not imitation.\"\n\n\"Calling (Zhuque-3) a 'Chinese Falcon 9,' I think, is a ‍very high compliment.\"\n\nIts startup culture and mimicking of SpaceX has already initiated a paradigm shift in China's space industry.\n\nChina's state-led space programme has historically been allergic to failed launches, in contrast to SpaceX and other Western firms that regularly broadcast their mishaps.\n\nBut earlier this month, state media covered China's first two failed attempts at recovering a reusable rocket, with the second launch ​coming from a state-owned firm, just three weeks after Zhuque-3's maiden flight.\n\nLandSpace also opened its engine factory floor to Reuters this month, allowing foreign media to take ‌a peek at one of its core assets for the first time.\n\nAfter opening up the space sector to private money in 2014, which spawned several startups including LandSpace, Beijing is now looking to help leading domestic players tap into capital markets by making it easier for them to pursue IPOs.",

    "description": "If you’re a constantly busy people-pleaser, you may want to read this.",
    "fullText": "It’s fair to say that many of us would describe our adult lives as “busy.” I mean, how could they not be? We may work, go to the gym, spend time with family, engage in hobbies and much more. For some of us, this isn’t new, either: We had busy childhoods, too, bouncing from school to soccer practice to piano lessons. While being busy can feel stressful, it isn’t inherently a bad thing; in fact (and within reason), it can foster positive feelings and is even tied to better cognition.\n\nAt the same time, it’s important to note that busyness can also point to something more subtle and less beneficial: overfunctioning. A habit that can start as early as childhood, it can be a sign that we’re simply doing too much. The reason behind it is often rooted in trauma or neglect. It can also lead us to neglect our needs further, which can be damaging.\n\nSo, let’s discuss what overfunctioning as a child looks like, nine common traits of adults who overfunctioned as children, what exactly causes the habit, how it can affect you as an adult and how to deal. Psychologists share their expert insight on all of those pieces below.\n\n“Normal” functioning can look like doing chores, abiding by a bedtime routine, doing work assignments and being timely, to name some examples. So, “overfunctioning” is doing more of that than is necessary or typical. \n\n“To overfunction is to fulfill emotional or practical responsibilities that are beyond what is appropriate or expected for a particular role or developmental level, especially to the point of experiencing negative physical or psychological consequences,” says Dr. Natalie Anderson, PhD, a clinical psychologist with MedStar Health.\n\nFor example, children may take care of their younger siblings, manage household tasks or even provide emotional support to their parents.\n\n“We often see this in ‘parentified children,’ which is common in families where the primary parent or caregiver is not able to provide their full caregiving abilities due to mental health or other challenges, including substance use,” addsDr. Dylan Ross, PhD, an organizational psychologist and the Chief Clinical & Strategy Officer at PsychHub.\n\nAs mentioned, overfunctioning children are typically “parentified children,” AKA children who step into the parental role. They do this because they feel they need to, according to Dr. Ross. For example, if their parent is passed out from substances or unable to get out of bed due to depression or grief, the child may be the one who has to perform the familial and household duties—or it won’t get done.\n\nWhat we’re looking at here, Dr. Anderson specifies, are imbalances, inappropriate expectations and excessive demands. \n\n“This may be a family system in which some members are actually underfunctioning, leading to a need for other members of the family to overfunction to create stability,” she says.\n\nThat’s not necessarily the case 100 percent of the time, however. Dr. Anderson points to how families can experience traumatic experiences or chronic stressors that require all of the family to overfunction to survive. For example, a young teenager is working or taking care of their siblings because their parents have to work multiple jobs to pay bills.\n\nFeeling like you’re responsible for everything—including things out of your control—is a common trait in these adults. They may “own” problems at work, for example, that aren’t theirs. This, in turn, affects their mental health.\n\n“We see this show up in ways such as chronic guilt, resentment, overapologizing or the person feeling like they have failed when something goes wrong, even though they did everything right,” Dr. Ross says. “This happens because, as children, they learned that everything depended on them and that any issue in the family was somehow their fault or their responsibility to fix.”\n\nGiven the experiences that many overfunctioning kids have, it’s no wonder that anxiety is common among them.\n\n“Those who have overfunctioned are often on the lookout for anything that could go wrong and are thinking about what they can do about it,” Dr. Anderson explains. “They’ve learned this mindset is needed to maintain safety and security.”\n\nThat can lead to them being in fight-or-flight mode (to varying degrees) all the time, she continues, causing chronic anxiety.\n\nHypervigilance is an increased sense of awareness and alertness, and it’s another big indicator. \n\n“People who overfunctioned as children often have nervous systems that are constantly scanning their social environment for problems, causing it to be difficult for them to rest, relax and be present because they're always awaiting the next crisis,” Dr. Ross says.\n\nA sense of control can help people feel safe and secure. \n\n“Sometimes, a sense of control is only achieved by ‘fixing’ or managing the details of both day-to-day things and larger tasks,” Dr. Anderson says.\n\nSetting and maintaining boundaries can be difficult for many of us. In adults who overfunctioned as kids, the main boundary concern is not knowing what their boundaries are. \n\n“When a child spends a large portion of their childhood focusing on other people’s needs, they don’t get enough practice in figuring out what they actually want, need or even how they feel,” Dr. Ross explains. “This can show up in adults as people-pleasing, challenges in setting boundaries with others or a sense of performing a role instead of living authentically.”\n\nAlong the lines of blurred boundaries, these adults tend to suppress their emotions, thinking they can’t have feelings while being “the responsible one.” \n\n“Although considered prosocial behaviors, in excess, this role can also lead to diminishing or ignoring their own needs,” Dr. Anderson says. “Because they are used to doing so much and not getting as much emotional or practical support from others, they may have a hard time admitting when they need help.”\n\nPeople who have codependent patterns typically feel like their worth and stability are deeply tied to other people—how they're doing, their feelings of worthiness and so on.\n\n“It is difficult for them to distinguish where they end and another person begins,” Dr. Ross describes. \n\nAdditionally, this means they may struggle to maintain their own identity, and they may experience anxiety or emptiness when they don’t feel actively needed by another person.\n\nOverfunctioning isn’t only about doing a lot of things, but also about doing them well. \n\n“Adults who overfunctioned as children tend to have extremely high standards for themselves and a deep-rooted fear of making mistakes,” Dr. Ross says. “This is because, as a child, their worth and safety were tied to how well they performed their roles.”\n\nDr. Anderson adds that perfectionist tendencies begin to feel normal for the overfunctioning person; anything less feels inadequate, causing feelings of insecurity.\n\nThis trait builds on perfectionism and wanting to feel in control. \n\n“Those who have overfunctioned may be seeking a felt sense of being ‘good enough’ or completely prepared for any potential negative outcome, often leading to incredibly high standards and expectations of themselves,” Dr. Anderson says.\n\nCertain successes (such as social validation, awards, getting the highest grade and extra financial security) can provide that temporarily.\n\nBetween perfectionism, guilt, loads of responsibility and more, it’s not surprising that adulthood isn’t easy, especially as a past overfunctioning child. But the good news is, if you’re here, you’ve already begun to heal. Identification and education are where it starts.\n\nFirst, Dr. Anderson says it’s important “to realize that you are, in fact, overfunctioning in at least one aspect of your life, which could be at home, in your relationships or at work.” What’s yours to take care of, and what’s not? What can be delegated?\n\nThen, realize what is and isn’t “on” you. \n\n“The first step is to recognize that overfunctioning as a child wasn’t a choice and wasn’t your fault, but rather it was a coping style in response to circumstances beyond your control,” Dr. Ross says. \n\nFurther, he encourages people to identify their maladaptive coping behaviors, AKA ones that no longer serve them. A super relatable example is people-pleasing.\n\nFrom that point, take small steps, allowing yourself to feel the challenging feelings that arise while giving yourself love. \n\n“Most importantly, as you do this, treat yourself with the same kindness and compassion that you would treat a good friend trying to make changes in their life,” Dr. Anderson says.\n\nWorking with a therapist is another solid option—specifically, one who understands family systems and developmental trauma, Dr. Ross says—so you can address the patterns, gain insight and learn new skills. Don’t have one yet? Psychology Today has a clinician database where you can filter through providers.\n\n“This is both a very common issue and one that can be hard to overcome,” Dr. Anderson concludes. “You’re not alone.”\n\nUp Next:\n\nDr. Natalie Anderson, PhD, is a clinical psychologist with MedStar Health.\n\nDr. Dylan Ross, PhD, is an organizational psychologist and the chief clinical and strategy officer at PsychHub.\n\nThe Busier the Better: Greater Busyness Is Associated With Better Cognition, Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience",

    "title": "Missing Robot In The Antarctic Returned With Terrifying Data",
    "description": "A robotic ocean float was lost under the Antarctic ice for eight months, but it miraculously reappeared, bearing some distressing data regarding climate change.",
    "fullText": "An Australian national science agency called CSIRO launched an experiment in Antarctica that went terribly wrong — in a way that ended up going wonderfully right. A free-floating ocean robot was sent to collect data from the Totten Glacier. However, a current pulled it away from its destination and westward. It ended up in a place very difficult for scientists to analyze, and it returned with extremely rare and valuable data.\n\nThe ocean float has salinity and temperature sensors and was meant to go below the water and surface once every 10 days to transmit its data to satellites. Robots like these are used frequently in ocean research and sometimes for measuring the impact of climate change on the waters and glaciers. This specific one was meant to study the Totten Glacier in regards to how much the global sea levels could rise if the glacier melted. This is such a concern that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) even has an interactive map to show which coastlines could be permanently underwater in the future.\n\nPulled off its course, this float actually ended up underneath the ice of the Denman Glacier in a location extremely difficult for scientists to observe and collect data from. Though the research team feared it was lost forever, it popped back out nine months later. With it was a set of crucial data for the Denman Glacier and how climate change is impacting Antarctica as a whole.\n\nThe robot traveled beneath the Denman Glacier and the Shackleton ice shelf. Though trapped, the robot ocean float continued to do what it was meant to: It measured water salinity and temperature from the sea floor up to the base of the ice shelf it was under. However, it could not surface to transmit this data to satellites, so it was navigationally lost for the research team. There was one trail of clues left to follow; as the float tried to surface, it bumped the ice shelf. Whenever it did so, it was able to measure the depth of the ice shelf.\n\nThe research team was able to compare the data of the ice shelf's depth to satellite measurements of the area. From that, they were able to piece together an idea of the path the ocean float took, thus knowing where its salinity and temperature measurements were specifically coming from. Throughout its mission, the robot collected 195 profiles of data.\n\nThe data returned showed that the Shackleton ice shelf is not yet in danger of warm water melting it. However, the Denman Glacier does have warm water beneath that is causing it to melt. This glacier on its own could cause sea levels around the world to rise by almost 5 feet. Identifying these risk areas is important, as it seems we may be past the point of no return for some climate change damage, and the world's coastlines may be in danger no matter what.\n\nThis scientific accident turned out to be a stroke of luck for the team. The ocean float gathered data from areas never before researched. In fact, this was the first ever line of oceanographic measurements under an East Antarctic ice shelf. This has provided critical data about this area and the risk posed to the Denman Glacier.\n\nSince the robot float did survive under the ice for so long with good data, scientists look to the future of sending more of these floats into very remote places in hopes of returning rare data. Though that comes with its risks, the insight gathered could be critical to monitor glacial melting and create predictions for sea levels rising.\n\nThe fact that the ocean float measured Eastern Antarctica specifically is also very important for future research. It holds more ice than West Antarctica, so glaciers melting in that area pose a greater overall threat for coastlines. Measuring under ice shelves also could shed greater light on if Antarctica is rising out of the ocean and what that could mean for the planet. The data from this lost robot was put into publication in the ScienceAdvances journal in December 2025 under the title \"Circulation and ocean–ice shelf interaction beneath the Denman and Shackleton Ice Shelves.\" It now serves as a useful piece of research for Antarctic studies.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

What do we even do now?”\n\nAn 11-year-old boy in Alabama died after a severe case of the flu.\n\nJace Watkins died on Saturday, Dec. 27, after being hospitalized due to complications from the flu, according to Fox 8.\n\nThe boy received treatment from the Children’s of Alabama intensive care unit. During his illness, he suffered seizures and had trouble breathing.\n\nEarlier in the week, his family said he was not receiving enough oxygen to his brain due to swelling.\n\nWatkins' aunt, Sabrina Parsons, said he had no underlying health issues, per Fox 8. \"He was a premature baby, but other than that, he’s had inhalers and stuff, but that’s been years ago,\" she said. \"He was telling everybody he was fine, he felt fine. And then, I guess he started throwing up that night and had a seizure.\"\n\nWatkins was a fifth-grade student at Hueytown Intermediate School. The school’s principal Cari McClellan shared an emotional statement in honor of the boy via Facebook on Dec. 28, writing, \"Our hearts are broken this morning. ... Jace Watkins passed away last night after a brief and sudden illness. There really aren’t words to adequately describe what we’re feeling right now.\"\n\nMcClellan continued, \"Jace was a bright light to everyone who knew him. His sweet genuine smile will be missed by all.  Please continue to pray for his family, and our school family, as we all work to navigate this unimaginable loss.\"\n\nA family friend organized a community prayer vigil for the boy on Dec. 23, the school shared in a previous statement.\n\nA GoFundMe created for Watkins and his family has raised more than $6,000 so far.\n\nThe description for the page stated that Watkins fell ill and visited a doctor the following day. He was told, at the time, that his \"lungs sounded clear.\" Days later, he had a seizure and was taken to the hospital where he was diagnosed with the flu.\n\nThe page said, at one point, Watkins was placed on a ventilator.\n\nSabrina made an emotional Facebook post on Dec. 28, writing, \"I just want to say.. Jace never even got to open his Christmas gifts ...

    "fullText": "HONOLULU (AP) — Mike Lambert heard fewer illegal fireworks exploding in his suburban Honolulu neighborhood in the months after a chain of blasts at a house party last New Year's Eve led to the deaths of six people, including a 3-year-old boy.\n\nAs the director of Hawaii's Department of Law Enforcement, Lambert wondered if the tragedy had sparked a shift in Hawaii residents' penchant for igniting illegal fireworks. In some neighborhoods, it would be common to hear loud booms any time of day or night — for sporting events, celebrations or no apparent reason at all.\n\nBut this year, authorities are armed with stiffer laws created in the wake of the tragedy and will be giving out citations to offenders, Lambert warned.\n\n“We have no delusions that you can have a tragedy New Year’s, you can sign a law in July and then not have anything go off the following year,” he said. Still, he expects that some people will decide not to set off fireworks, either because of last year's deadly accident or the stepped-up enforcement and new laws.\n\n“Before, you could shoot it off with impunity,” said state Rep. Scot Matayoshi, who authored two of the five anti-fireworks bills. “Everyone knew they weren’t going to bust you.”\n\nPolice can now issue $300 tickets to those who shoot off fireworks, while repeat offenders and people whose actions cause serious injury or death could get prison time for felony crimes.\n\nMatayoshi said he began working on legislation the morning after the tragedy, which took place at a New Year's Eve 2025 celebration when crates of illegal fireworks tipped over and ignited in the Aliamanu neighborhood, illuminating the sky in a terrifying set of explosions that left more than a dozen people with severe burns.\n\n“It affected me a lot,” Matayoshi said. “I couldn’t imagine being the neighbor of someone who had basically bombs in their house going off and hurting and killing my kids.”\n\nNone of the the 12 people arrested have been charged with a crime. Honolulu police said they're working with prosecutors in seeking charges.\n\nA hopeful sign was an amnesty event last month where people turned in 500 pounds (227 kilograms) of illegal fireworks, Lambert said. His department has also increased searches at all ports, noting that illegal fireworks shipped to Hawaii often have ties to organized crime.\n\nAs of earlier this month, Honolulu police said officers had issued 10 fireworks citations. Matayoshi said the number is an improvement from zero in past years. He expects it to jump dramatically on New Year's Eve.\n\nFirecrackers to ring in the new year have long been popular in Hawaii, but about a decade ago, professional-grade aerials started becoming common.\n\n“You're seeing fireworks that were meant to be let off at like stadium and hotel events,\" Lambert said. Those pyrotechnics have a 900-foot (274-meter) blast radius, but are exploding in tightly packed neighborhoods where homes are often just a few feet apart, he said.\n\nArmy veteran Simeon Rojas grew up on Oahu in the 1980s and ’90s and enjoyed setting off firecrackers and lighting sparklers on New Year's Eve. He considers fireworks part of the local culture and tradition.\n\nBut when fireworks suddenly explode when he's at home in Honolulu's Kalihi Valley, “it does rock my heart,\" he said. It also triggers his post-traumatic stress disorder from serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n“It gives me flashbacks,” he said. “I stay with my wife and kids on New Year's Eve, so I feel safe.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump slathered a fresh coat of makeup on his hand for another round of peace talks with Ukraine on Sunday.\n\nTrump, 79, welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to his Mar-a-Lago estate as he continues to chase down an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, which he promised to end on his first day back in office.\n\nThe mismatched concealer on Trump’s hand was once again evident as he took questions from reporters.\n\nJust days ago, on Christmas Eve, the now-familiar bruising on Trump’s right hand was coupled with some discoloration on his left. On Sunday, however, his left hand seemed back to normal, while his right hand remained covered in makeup.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reverted to a statement she has been reusing since February when reached for comment by the Daily Beast.\n\n“President Trump is a man of the people and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other President in history. His commitment is unwavering and he proves that every single day,” she said.\n\nLeavitt previously attributed the persistent bruising to “minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has closely catalogued the bruising on Trump’s hand, which he has been nursing for months. The makeup smears, together with Trump’s swollen ankles, mysterious MRI, mental flubs, and twice-in-a-year “annual” medical checkups, have raised concerns about the health of the oldest person to be inaugurated president.\n\nThe White House has consistently maintained that Trump is in “excellent health.”\n\nThe president was joined by several of his officials in Mar-a-Lago as he sat down for another meeting with Zelensky, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nA day before the meeting, Russia struck Kyiv with ballistic missiles and drones, killing at least one person and injuring 27 others.\n\nDespite the attack, Trump said he still believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was “very serious” about finding common ground with Ukraine.\n\n“I do believe that we have the makings of a deal that’s good for Ukraine, that’s good for everybody. There’s nothing more important,” he told reporters. “I’ve settled eight wars and this is the most difficult one. I thought it would be in the middle of the pack. This is the most difficult one, but we’re gonna get it done.”\n\nThe president stopped short of laying out a timeline for the end of peace talks.\n\n“I don’t have deadlines,” he said. “You know what my deadline is? Getting the war ended.”",

    "fullText": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea is promising to shrink its reliance on coal power as part of its pledge to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to climate change, but that ambition is at odds with the Trump administration’s push for more U.S. natural gas exports.\n\nAt recent United Nations climate talks, South Korea's new Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment announced plans to retire most of the country’s coal-fired power plants by 2040 and to at least halve its carbon emissions by 2035.\n\nExperts say this shows that South Korea, a major coal importer with one of the world’s largest fleets of coal plants, wants to speed up its renewable energy transition, which lags behind its neighbors and global averages.\n\nBut as part of trade deals with President Donald Trump, Seoul is raising imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas, or LNG. Climate activists contend such plans may conflict with the country’s pledges to help curb climate change and could lock South Korea into a fossil fuel-dependent future.\n\nTalks are underway for South Korea to invest $350 billion in U.S. projects and purchase up to $100 billion worth of U.S. energy products, including LNG, a natural gas cooled to liquid form for easy storage and travel. It burns cleaner than coal, but still causes planet-warming emissions, especially of methane.\n\nSouth Korea’s overall LNG imports may not increase if it offsets purchases of more U.S. natural gas by reducing imports from other sources such as Australia and the Middle East.\n\nStill, it's unclear how South Korea will “manage and consolidate all this somehow contradictory planning regarding its energy sector,\" said Michelle Kim, an energy specialist for the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\n\nPower transition sparks climate goals\n\nSouth Korea's liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who won a snap election in June, campaigned for stronger climate commitments. They had softened under his conservative predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted after a short-lived martial law declaration.\n\n“As the global temperature rises, we all need to responsibly take climate action and Korea will have a stronger sense of responsibility in tackling the climate crisis,\" Kim Sung-hwan, the inaugural Minister of Climate, Energy and Environment, said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nSouth Korea's goal to cut carbon emissions by 53% to 61% of its 2018 level, fell short of climate activists’ expectations. Business lobbies representing major manufacturers had proposed a 48% emissions reduction target.\n\n“This range presents an effort by the government to accommodate two very different ways of thinking about the economic and climate future of the nation,” said Joojin Kim of the Seoul-based advocacy group, Solutions for Our Climate.\n\nSouth Korea faces climate dilemma over U.S. deal\n\nThe South Korean government made the ambitious commitment to increase its clean energy use even after Trump's sweeping ‘America First’ tariffs spurred energy negotiations between Seoul and Washington.\n\nAs part of its broader efforts to avoid higher tariffs, South Korea offered to import more LNG from the U.S., but the final trade deal has not been announced.\n\nThe agreement still under negotiation could last between three to 10 years, according to industry analysis and U.S. federal documents. Depending on the deal's duration, South Korea may import between 3 million to 9 million tons of American LNG a year.\n\nLNG made up almost a fifth of South Korea’s total energy supply last year, according to the International Energy Agency, or IEA. The government's target was to cut that to 10.6% by 2038.\n\nSouth Korea risks its climate goals if the pending trade deal increases the total volume of imported LNG, which will likely lead to an oversupply issue and the excess burning of gas to justify the deal, said Insung Lee, with Greenpeace in Seoul.\n\n“If we just replace coal plants with LNG, that means the coal exit actually doesn’t lead to a green transition and merely shifts Korea’s addiction from coal to gas, which undermines the whole spirit of climate action,\" Lee said.\n\nRenewable energy generated 7% of South Korea’s domestic power in 2022, according to the IEA. South Korean government data show that had increased to 10.5% last year, still one of the lowest levels among leading economies.\n\nJapan, with an economy more than twice as big, generates 21% of its power from renewable sources. Spain, whose economy is about the same size as South Korea's, gets 42% of its power from renewable sources.\n\nClean energy provided about 30% of global electricity production in 2023.\n\nNuclear power produces a major share of South Korea's domestic energy, with government data showing that nuclear sources accounted for 31% of total electricity generation last year.\n\n“We will transition into a new energy system that focuses on renewables and nuclear, while phasing out coal,” said Kim, the energy minister. He said South Korea will use LNG as a “complementary or emergency energy source” to make up for irregularities in renewable energy supplies.\n\nIn early December, South Korea set another goal of boosting its offshore wind power capacity to 4 gigawatts, about 10 times the current level.\n\nSouth Korean companies that don’t cut back on carbon emissions may find that to be a competitive disadvantage, said Michelle Kim of the IEEFA.\n\nMany global industries, including shipping and aviation, face pressure to reduce their emissions by providing incentives for low emitters and creating deterrents for high ones, she said.\n\n“This is a lot of risk,” she said. “South Korea needs to speed up renewable energy deployment and come out from high dependency on the fossil fuel industry.”\n\nCoal trade braces for South Korea cuts\n\nAt last month's climate talks, South Korea joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance, a group of businesses, organizations and governments promoting the green energy transition.\n\nThat's mainly a symbolic move, said Bruce Douglas, with the Global Renewables Alliance. “But it signifies very clear government intention to move away from fossil fuels and towards clean power.”\n\nSouth Korea imports virtually all its coal, largely from Australia, Indonesia and Russia, and the switch to renewables is bound to impact regional markets.\n\nThe pledge to retire 40 of South Korea's 61 coal sites by 2040 may be “an enforced transition\" for coal exporters in the Asia-Pacific region, said James Bowen, with Climate Analytics. “It’s a reality that they’re going to have to face this downturn in the market.”\n\n“The writing's on the wall,\" Bowen said. “One of the biggest importers in the world, one of the biggest customers, is starting to move away from coal.”\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "fullText": "The Knesset moved to prohibit brothel operations nationwide, with officials stressing that prostitution will not disappear without coordinated action and local enforcement.\n\nThe Knesset’s Internal Affairs and Environment Committee has commenced action to ban the operations of brothels, the governing body announced on Sunday.\n\nCommittee chairman MK Yitzhak Kreuzer said that prostitution exists in the State of Israel and will not disappear without being properly addressed. In February 2025, Justice Minister Yariv Levin announced that a once-temporary law, which prohibited the consumption of prostitution, introduced in July 2020, became permanent.\n\nThe law made it illegal for individuals to purchase sex, with penalties ranging from administrative fines to criminal charges. These efforts were cited as efforts to combat human trafficking within Israel.\n\n\"There are authorities that deal with it, and there are those that ignore it, and in many cases, the phenomenon only worsens,” Kreuzer stated, adding that the topic was discussed following a request from Israeli NGO, Task Force on Human Trafficking and Prostitution.\n\nMoriah Rodel-Silfan, CEO of the organization, said in a statement that authorities can either ignore the issue or approach it head-on for a solution. She called on local authorities to act to eradicate the issue.\n\nLior Rosenbaum, a representative of the headquarters to combat trafficking of women, added that failing to act on the issue would only allow it to grow. Rosenbaum praised the Tel Aviv municipality for its successful fight against prostitution, resulting in the closure of brothels and discreet operations in the city.\n\nDeputy Mayor of Jerusalem Adir Schwartz told authorities in the Knesset that in Jerusalem, prostitution is largely concentrated on youth from the Haredi community, noting municipal plans and efforts to reduce prostitution.\n\nHealth Ministry representatives added that sex workers in Israel are not largely “street” workers, and outside enforcement would be needed to combat efforts.\n\nMaya Baron, Director of the Extreme Risk & Trauma Field at Israeli NGO ELEM, focused on youth in distress in Israel, noted the difference between prostitution in men and women in a statement. “Women engage in prostitution in discreet apartments, while men are on the street. Opening the doors of local authorities and acquiring the appropriate knowledge will enable assistance and response.\"\n\nDuring the meeting, MK Adi Aziz, among others, questioned police representatives about police raids on brothels and discreet apartments. She stated that raids were often not conducted in helpful manners to girls impacted; she cited a lack of social workers involved in the matter to assist survivors during the investigation and help them navigate alternative housing and rehabilitation.\n\nPolice representatives responded, stating that additional brothels would soon be closed through administrative orders, as well as additional efforts to be made in rehabilitation for survivors in cooperation with the Social Affairs Ministry.\n\nSurvivors testified in Knesset, including D. McCullough, who emphasized local authorities' role in combating prostitution. “The prostitution industry is not only a crime but also an industry, and if it has no way of making money, it will not operate. The local authorities have the power to strangle the prostitution industry economically, and that is enormous power,” McCullough told Knesset representatives.\n\n“If the brothel is masquerading as residential apartments, then the apartment is not operating according to its purpose, and therefore the brothel needs to be closed, and the more you close, the less profitable it will be for pimps to open in the city. Every brothel that is closed saves a lot of women and girls,” they added. “A brothel that closes saves the ugly spots from your city, so you should close them.\"",

    "fullText": "At some point, sneakers, which used to be solely about athletic performance, crossed over into fashion.\n\nBefore his wedding, my brother actually told me that he had to tell his friends they could not wear Jordans with their Hugo Boss tuxedos. Being a little older than the rest of the wedding party, it never occurred to me that sneakers had become so fashionable that some people would wear them in a situation that calls for dress shoes.\n\nClearly, sneakers have crossed over culturally, with certain models now functioning as luxury items, despite their athletic roots. That shift helps explain why the resale market has grown so rapidly and why collectors are willing to pay premium prices.\n\n“What began as a niche culture among sneakerheads has now become part of everyday fashion. Sneakers have evolved into investment pieces, with some models seeing enormous value increases,” Vinted Senior Brand Expert Jens Kuhlmann told AIM Group for its report, \"Running up a $30 billion business: How sneaker resale has gone global.\"\n\nSneakers have also become an investment.\n\n“The unregulated aftermarket or resale market for sneakers and streetwear is scaling at a rapid growth rate, fueled by lean inventory from major sneaker brands (e.g., Nike), consistent drops of new releases, deep sneaker archives from which to draw for future releases, an endless aisle, a community of like-minded enthusiasts, and digital marketplaces that offer transparency and ease of use,” according to Cowen's Sneakers As An Alternative Asset Class.\n\nThat has created a market and launched a number of retailers that specialize in selling and reselling sneakers. One of those chains, Soleply, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this year and has since closed four of its six stores.\n\nSoleply filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March after taking on too much debt and unsustainable leases, according to court documents filed with PacerMonitor.\n\nThe sneaker reseller noted in its bankruptcy filing that the move is due to “financial distress” largely driven by \"high-interest, short-term debt used to fund store expansions, which created a cycle of inventory shortages and cash flow instability that ultimately proved unsustainable,\" WWD.com reported.\n\nThe retail chain sells streetwear and sneakers from brands including Asics, Nike, Jordan, and New Balance. It shared in its filing that while each store was initially profitable, the burden of debt repayment soon began to take its toll.\n\n“Cash flow constraints forced Soleply to divert substantial revenue toward loan payments, leaving insufficient capital to maintain adequate inventory levels,” the filing said. “As a result, some stores struggled to sustain the same level of sales, and the company faced mounting financial challenges.”",

    "fullText": "Staying warm and off the road is better than Ezra\n\nAs Winter Storm Ezra intensifies across the central and eastern United States, the freight industry faces a severe threat from high winds that could blow over trailers, disrupting operations and endangering drivers. The storm, which began escalating on Sunday, is unleashing gusts of 50+ mph in parts of the Upper Midwest, with impacts stretching east of Interstate 35, according to real-time data from SONAR Critical Events. SONAR is actively monitoring the situation, providing critical insights to assess and mitigate the storm’s impact on the freight market as conditions worsen.\n\nHigh winds are a massive hazard for truckers, as their trailers become kites in 40+mph winds. \n\nThis can happen on the highway, right next to you as you drive with your family. You can become a victim of a trailer being blown over. \n\nExercise extra caution this week in highways… https://t.co/fWAw5ufbZo\n\n(@FreightAlley) December 29, 2025\n\nHigh Winds Turn Trailers into Hazards, Urging Drivers to Stay Home\n\nSONAR Critical Events has issued high wind alerts for regions east of I-35, with gusts of 50+ mph reported in the Upper Midwest. The platform is tracking an extratropical cyclone set to impact the U.S. and Canada from 2:00 AM EST on December 29 through 3:00 AM EST on December 30, offering freight operators data to navigate potential market disruptions. Winds exceeding 40 mph pose a critical risk, turning truck trailers into kite-like structures vulnerable to rollovers—especially on highways with dense traffic in the Midwest.\n\nThis hazard threatens not only freight movement but also the safety of drivers and other road users. SONAR’s data highlights “High Road Danger” conditions across states like Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, and the Northeast, as well as Canadian provinces like Ontario and Quebec, where road obstructions, collisions, and closures are already emerging. Truck drivers are strongly urged to stay home if possible to avoid these life-threatening risks as the storm peaks Monday.\n\nSONAR Critical Events: Monitoring Wind Impacts on Freight Stability\n\nSONAR’s real-time monitoring provides a detailed wind forecast to help the freight industry prepare. The latest update includes:\n\nWind Gusts: Ranging from 30 to 45 mph, with maxima reaching 50 mph, particularly in the Upper Midwest, where Michigan’s Upper Peninsula has already seen gusts exceeding 65 km/h (40 mph).\n\nImpact Areas: States east of I-35, including the Great Lakes region and Northeast, are under close watch as SONAR evaluates potential delays and cost increases.\n\nMarket Implications: The combination of strong winds and blowing snow reduces visibility and increases the likelihood of trailer rollovers, potentially driving up insurance costs and shipment delays.\n\nSONAR’s advanced mapping tools enable logistics managers to identify high-risk lanes where staying off the road is the safest option. The platform’s recommendation to avoid driving aligns with efforts to protect drivers and stabilize freight operations during the storm’s height.\n\nIndustry Response and Preparedness\n\nWinter Storm Ezra’s rapid intensification has SONAR on high alert, with enhanced collaboration with WeatherOptics delivering hyperlocal wind insights to help carriers adjust schedules and mitigate market instability. SONAR is also tracking lake-effect snow driven by these winds, with potential accumulations up to 60 cm (24 inches) along Lake Superior’s south shore, which could further disrupt cross-border freight from Canada. The focus remains on keeping trailers upright, with drivers encouraged to stay home if their routes fall within these danger zones.\n\nLooking Ahead: SONAR’s Ongoing Analysis Through Tuesday\n\nAs the Arctic air mass fueling Ezra interacts with warmer southern air, SONAR predicts the storm’s wind-driven impacts, including trailer rollover risks, will persist through Tuesday. The platform is continuously analyzing high road danger conditions and potential shipment delays affecting tens of millions across the Plains to the Northeast.\n\nLogistics managers should leverage SONAR Critical Events for updates, preparing for extended transit times on east-west routes where crosswinds are most severe. The clear message to truck drivers: stay home if possible to avoid the devastating impact of a trailer blown over by gusts. This real-time intelligence is crucial for optimizing freight market resilience.\n\nFreightWaves will continue to track Winter Storm Ezra’s progression, relying on SONAR’s monitoring to keep the industry informed. With winds threatening to topple trailers across the eastern U.S., safety and strategic planning are paramount. Stay tuned for further developments as the storm unfolds.\n\nThe post Truckers east of I-35 advised to stay home appeared first on FreightWaves.",

The loss combined with a runaway New England win over the New York Jets earlier Sunday secured the AFC East title for the Patriots.\n\nAfter being held off the scoreboard for the first 54 minutes of the game, the Bills rallied to score two touchdowns in the final 5:11. But they trailed 13-12 after the second touchdown thanks to a blocked extra point on their first.\n\nAt that point, with both teams exhausted and the game clock almost expired, the Bills opted to gamble with a 2-point conversion attempt instead of kicking and extra point for overtime. The gamble failed when Josh Allen's pass fell incomplete in the end zone. Fittingly, Allen threw the ill-fated pass under duress from Philadelphia's pass rush.\n\nALLEN'S PASS IS INCOMPLETE. THE EAGLES WILL WIN!! pic.twitter.com/hixSq2sZfa\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 29, 2025\n\nThe Eagles, meanwhile, entered Sunday locked into the NFC East title and out of the No. 1 seed in the NFC. They didn't have much to play for. But they improved their chances of moving past the Chicago Bears from the No. 3 seed to No. 2 with Sunday's win.\n\nAnd, perhaps, more importantly, their defense was overwhelming in a game that was billed as a potential Super Bowl preview.\n\nThe Bills have long operated as a second-half team and entered Sunday's game leading the NFL in second-half point differential (+109). They added to that differential with a 12-0 advantage after halftime. But it wasn't enough to secure the win after a dominant effort from Philadelphia's defense through most of the game.\n\nThe Eagles limited the Bills to three punts and a fumble in the first half en route to a 13-0 lead. They set the tone early with a sack of Josh Allen that forced a fumble that bounced from the Buffalo 30-yard line into Philadelphia territory.\n\nOUR BALL pic.twitter.com/qjS9W0nE3F\n\n— Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) December 28, 2025\n\nPhiladelphia recovered and converted the turnover into a Jalen Hurts touchdown pass to Dallas Goedert for a 7-0 lead. From there, the Bills were playing on the their heels against a Philadelphia defensive front that dominated their offensive line.\n\nWhen the Bills punted to conclude the opening drive of the second half after a scoreless first, fans who weathered cold rain in the Buffalo stands responded with boos.\n\nThe Bills didn't broach the red zone until the final five minutes of the third quarter. When they got to fourth-and-goal, they didn't convert.\n\nAllen took off for the end zone when he couldn't find an open receiver in the end zone. He escaped pressure only to be met by multiple Eagles defenders at the goal line. Zack Baun tackled him short of the goal line to force a turnover on downs.\n\nJosh Allen does not get there and the Eagles force the turnover on downs at the goal line!\n\n📺: FOX pic.twitter.com/HQgLCcm9OS\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 28, 2025\n\nBuffalo's next possession started at Philadelphia's 41 after the Eagles punted from their own end zone. It ended with another punt after Josh Allen lost 19 yards on a third-down sack.\n\nAgain, Allen couldn't find any open receivers. This time he ran backward in a failed effort to buy time from the Eagles' pass rush before Jalyx Hunt took him down for his second sack of the day.\n\nOn the Hunt pic.twitter.com/t3ipIHeMwR\n\n— Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) December 28, 2025\n\nPhiladelphia's offense was somehow worse in a second half that produced just 17 yards from scrimmage. But the Bills mustered too little too late after failing to score until an Allen touchdown sneak with 5:11 remaining.\n\nThe Bills mounted their late, last touchdown drive after forcing the fourth straight Philadelphia three-and-out of the second half. And they kept hope alive with a fourth-and-10 hook-and-lateral that set up a deep pass from Allen to Brandin Cooks to get into the red zone.\n\nARE YOU SERIOUS!?\n\n📺: FOX pic.twitter.com/MRjder4QGo\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 29, 2025\n\nBut Philadelphia's defense ultimately came up with one last stop on the 2-point conversion to secure the win.\n\nWhen the day was done, the Eagles had sacked Allen five times for a loss of 51 yards. They hit him six other times and kept the pressure on almost every time he dropped back. And they came up with stops when it mattered most.\n\nThe offensive woes that have plagued Philadelphia for much of the season continued as the Bills outgained the Eagles, 330-190. But the defense that anchored the Eagles' 10-5 start was good enough to secured win No. 11 on Sunday.",

    "description": "After not playing against Georgetown & not traveling to Creighton, this seemed like only a matter of time.",
    "fullText": "Our long national nightmare is over: After a DNP-CD on December 17 and a Did Not Travel — Personal Reasons on December 20th, Marquette men’s basketball announced on Sunday night that junior Zaide Lowery is no longer a part of the team.\n\nMarquette junior guard Zaide Lowery departs #MUBB program. pic.twitter.com/WZBJ2QIv5x\n\n— Marquette Basketball (@MarquetteMBB) December 28, 2025\n\nJunior guard Zaide Lowery will not return to the Marquette University men’s basketball program, head coach Shaka Smart announced this afternoon.\n\n“I would like to thank Zaide for his many contributions to our program over the last two and a half years,” Smart said. “We wish him the best in all of his future pursuits on and off the court.”\n\nLowery played in 73 career games for the Golden Eagles and started in nine of his 11 appearances in 2025-26, contributing 8.1 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.\n\nI find the phrasing interesting.\n\nThe tweet and the graphic say “departs program.” The text of the release in the graphic say “will not return to the program” as announced by the head coach. That feels like two different things, doesn’t it? “Departs” sounds like it’s Lowery’s choice…. “will not return” doesn’t quite get to that same point.\n\nZaide Lowery came into his junior year with a bright future as a contributor for Shaka Smart and the Golden Eagles. He closed the 2024-25 season strong, and with the departure of three starters from that season, it made all the sense in the world for Lowery to leapfrog off that strong finish to a spot in the starting lineup. That’s what we saw from him this season, and in Marquette’s first nine games, he averaged 9.0 points, 3.4 rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 1.2 steals in over 25 minutes per game.\n\nHowever, he was also shooting just 38% from the field and 32% from behind the three-point line, and in the wake of a 5-4 start for Marquette and coming off an 0-for-5 from the field performance, Lowery was swapped out of the starting lineup in favor of freshman Adrien Stevens against Wisconsin. Lowery played 14 minutes in that contest, and 12 against Purdue, both poor showings for the Golden Eagles in road losses.\n\nOn December 17th, Marquette opened up Big East play against Georgetown, and Lowery didn’t play at all. After the game, head coach Shaka Smart had this to say on the topic:\n\n“It’s a coach’s decision,” Smart said. “We’re continuing to try to evaluate and figure out what the best lineups are and what guys we need to have in the game.\n\n“From the standpoint, first and foremost, of who truly wants to pour into the other four guys with him out on the floor and be all in on Marquette. So that goes into who we play.”\n\nOn December 20th, right at the Big East required deadline to announce player availability for that night’s game against Creighton, Marquette announced that Lowery didn’t make the trip to Omaha with the team to face the Bluejays for personal reasons. That can be a lot of things, of course, and after the game, Smart gave zero indication that anything was out of line regarding Lowery’s status with the team. Ben Steele from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel point blank asked Smart if Lowery was suspended or leaving the team, and both times, Smart answered “Nope.”\n\nAsked Shaka Smart about Zaide Lowery not making trip with #mubb to Omaha:\n\n\"Just wasn't here for personal reasons.\"\n\nNot suspended?\n\n\"Nope\"\n\nNot leaving the team?\n\n\"Nope\"\n\n— Ben Steele (@BenSteeleMJS) December 21, 2025\n\nThose answers may have been true at the time, so I’m not going to jump up and down and demand accountability from Smart on that one….. but eight days later, Lowery is in fact leaving the team, presumably for reasons stemming from/related to Smart’s lack of interest in putting the Missourian on the floor against Georgetown.\n\nAlthough…. Steele seems to imply here that Smart’s answers were not 100% on the level at the time.\n\nIt was a tumultuous two months for Zaide Lowery at Marquette.\n\nStarted the first nine games, then lost starting gig. Playing time dwindled, culminating in a DNP-CD and not traveling with team as future plans got sorted out. #mubbhttps://t.co/nuN9lARxBI\n\n— Ben Steele (@BenSteeleMJS) December 28, 2025\n\nI’m not wrong, correct? “Not traveling with team as future plans got sorted out” definitely sounds like the departure was already in the works when the team left for Nebraska, right? Just something to think about.\n\nAnd so, it’s time for a new scholarship chart.\n\nLowery’s departure opens up spot #15 for the 2026-27 season. That alone will not cause Shaka Smart to head to the transfer portal for any new faces next season. Marquette will add two new freshmen this summer in Alex Egbuonu and Ethan Johnston, while Ian Miletic, Sheek Pearson, and Nash Walker will finish their redshirt seasons and move to the active roster in the fall of 2026. Finding playing time for 14 guys is hard enough, and when you’re mixing in that many new guys, why overcomplicate things with just one player who almost assuredly will not be someone who will make a major impact.\n\nOf course, that’s operating under the idea that Marquette is projected to have 14 guys on the roster when the ball goes in the air for real in November of 2026. Whether or not Zaide Lowery is the first departure from this team…. that’s something we’re going to have to wait until April to know for sure.\n\nFollow Anonymous Eagle on social media\n\nFacebook: AnonymousEagle\nInstagram: AnonymousEagleSBN\nBluesky: AnonymousEagle",

    "fullText": "Game update (Sunday evening): With Buffalo’s loss to the Eagles, the Patriots have clinched the AFC East.\n\nGame update: New England’s blowout win over the New York Jets moves the Patriots one step closer to clinching the AFC East. If the Bills lose or tie against the Eagles later today, the Patriots will clinch the AFC East title.\n\nIf Buffalo wins that game, New England can clinch the AFC East with a win over the Dolphins next week.\n\nNew England’s win also prevents the Broncos from clinching the No. 1 seed in the AFC. The Patriots can still catch Denver in that race. Both teams are now 13-3, and while the Broncos have a tiebreaker advantage over New England based on their record against common opponents, the Patriots can still secure the No. 1 seed in Week 18 with a win and a Denver loss.\n\nThe New England Patriots missed a golden opportunity to clinch the AFC East in Week 15, when they blew a 21-0 lead and lost to the Buffalo Bills.\n\nBut the upstart Patriots can finish the job in Week 17, albeit with a little bit of help.\n\nHere is how the Patriots can clinch the AFC East for the first time since the 2019 season, Tom Brady’s last campaign in New England.\n\nThe Patriots control their own destiny in the race with the Bills for the division title, but to clinch this weekend, they will need a little bit of help from a team that beat them in Super Bowl LII.\n\nNew England sits atop the division with a 12-3 record, one game ahead of the 11-4 Bills. With wins in their final two games (starting this weekend against the New York Jets, and then in the season finale against the Miami Dolphins), then the Patriots are division champions.\n\nHowever, New England can clinch the division this weekend, and start celebrating early. With a win over the Jets, and a Bills loss or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles, the Patriots are AFC East champions.\n\nNew England can also clinch the division with a tie against the Jets, and a Bills loss to the Eagles.\n\nThe Patriots are also in the running for the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but the advantage is in the Denver Broncos’ favor. Denver’s win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night improved their record to 13-3, and the Broncos have already clinched a tiebreaker advantage over the Patriots based on common games, which is the third tiebreaker after head-to-head (these two teams did not play this year) and record in conference games.\n\nNew England needs to win to keep their hopes for the No. 1 seed alive. A loss eliminates the Patriots from contention for the top spot in the AFC.\n\nHere are the full AFC standings entering Week 17:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (11-4) – x\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x\n\nx – Team has clinched a playoff spot\ne – Team has been eliminated from playoff contention\n\nAFC East standings entering Week 17:\n\nHere are the current AFC East standings:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x",

We knew that and we tried to do our best. In the first half they allowed us something down the right, but we lacked clarity in the final 15 metres. Still, the team did a great job, including the substitutes, who were decisive, especially Pio Esposito. But also the others, who rolled up their sleeves when it was needed in the final minutes.”\n\nBARI, ITALY – AUGUST 16: Francesco Pio Esposito of Inter during Pre-Season Friendly match between FC Internazionale and Olympiacos FC at Stadio San Nicola on August 16, 2025 in Bari, Italy. (Photo by Maurizio Lagana/Getty Images)\n\nThe Inter coach then expanded on the value of his young forward, who provided the assist for Lautaro Martinez’s winning goal against Atalanta.\n\n“I have four forwards who have all left a strong mark on our league campaign,” Chivu explained.\n\n“Pio is fundamental, just like Bonny. You already know the value of Lautaro and Thuram. Pio and Bonny are players who make themselves loved by the group.”\n\nChivu’s words underlined the trust he places in Inter’s attacking depth and the importance of squad unity, particularly in a demanding away fixture that required patience, resilience and decisive moments from the bench.\n\nWith the year ending on a high, Inter head into the new calendar year with momentum, confidence and growing belief in the club’s next generation.",

At the moment we’re top, but there are still a lot of matches to play. We have to stay focused and always give our maximum.”\n\nThe discussion then turned to his personal form and the perception that Chivu has revitalised him. Zielinski did not shy away from responsibility.\n\n“Of course, the responsibility was above all mine,” he admitted. “I didn’t arrive in the best condition, with those famous blisters,” he added with a laugh. “Injuries, serious and less serious, affected me, but that’s all behind me now.”\n\nThe Polish international concluded by underlining his mindset going forward. “I’m thinking about what I can give to the team. Now you’re seeing the best version of me.”",

    "fullText": "Cristian Chivu warns Inter are ‘ready to fight’ after victory away to Atalanta, but won’t get drawn into more controversy. ‘I am not interested in what Antonio Conte says.’\n\nThe Nerazzurri were feeling the pressure after a disappointing Supercoppa Italiana in Riyadh, where they lost to Bologna on penalties in the semi-final and made an early return home.\n\nThey had a goal disallowed in Bergamo for offside before Lautaro Martinez made the most of a Berat Djimsiti howler, his pass intercepted by substitute Francesco Pio Esposito.\n\nRemarkably, Esposito had only been introduced for Marcus Thuram a few moments earlier, so made an immediate impact.\n\nBERGAMO, ITALY – DECEMBER 28: FC Internazionale coach Cristian Chivu looks on during the Serie A match between Atalanta BC and FC Internazionale at New Balance Arena on December 28, 2025 in Bergamo, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\n“I am pleased with Marcus too today, as he worked hard and wore down their defence with the right movements, but he was running out of steam, so I introduced Pio,” Chivu told DAZN Italia.\n\n“He came on with the right attitude and intercepted that ball, sending Lautaro on goal. I’m happy with the whole team today, who tried to control the game in the first half, then Atalanta stepped up their counter-measures by going man for man after the break.\n\n“We’re also pleased with the result, because that might not be the only thing that counts, but it’s certainly important.”\n\nPio Esposito was the only other striker available, as Ange-Yoan Bonny had been ruled out of the trip with a sprained ankle.\n\n“These are all players who work hard, put the effort in, and help the team when called upon. We are happy to have four great strikers, that they are all scoring goals and working well together,” noted Chivu.\n\nBERGAMO, ITALY – DECEMBER 28: FC Internazionale coach Cristian Chivu reacts during the Serie A match between Atalanta BC and FC Internazionale at New Balance Arena on December 28, 2025 in Bergamo, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nIt means Inter end 2025 on top of the Serie A table and with their captain scoring in four consecutive league games. Considering their pedigree and history, is their presence at the top to be taken for granted?\n\n“Nothing can be taken for granted in football. You need to work hard and prove yourself competitive on the pitch. However, we’re not even halfway through the season yet, so we know there’s a long path ahead of us, that at times we will have to fight against injustice, against those who think it is all to be taken for granted.\n\n“Ultimately, the only proof is on the pitch. We are giving it our all, trying to respond blow for blow to the other teams, and keeping our heads up high. We are ready to keep fighting even harder.”\n\nBERGAMO, ITALY – DECEMBER 28: Piotr Zielinski of FC Internazionale in action during the Serie A match between Atalanta BC and FC Internazionale at New Balance Arena on December 28, 2025 in Bergamo, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nAmong the things they have to battle against are also the comments of Napoli coach Conte, who again said today that Inter, Juventus and AC Milan are the favourites for the Scudetto. What is Chivu’s response?\n\n“I am not interested in what Conte says,” he shrugged.\n\nChivu was informed that the word of 2025 was ‘faith’ and so what would his word of 2026 be to describe Inter?\n\n“I haven’t finished 2025 yet, give me four days and then I might answer when the first game of 2026 comes around! I hope to be there, at least…”",

    "fullText": "Inter Milan head coach Cristian Chivu praised the courage and adaptability of his side after their 1-0 win over Atalanta, highlighting the impact of young forwards Ange-Yoan Bonny and Pio Esposito as the Nerazzurri closed 2025 alone at the top of Serie A.\n\nSpeaking to DAZN after the final whistle in Bergamo, with quotes via FCInterNews, Cristian Chivu reflected on a performance that could have produced a wider margin.\n\nHowever, it was ultimately decided by Lautaro Martinez’s finish.\n\nAsked about Inter stepping outside their comfort zone, particularly the substitution of Marcus Thuram for Pio Esposito, which led to the winning assist, Chivu stressed collective effort above individual moments.\n\n“I’m happy with Marcus’ performance,” he said.\n\n“He worked hard, occupied the defenders, ran a lot and applied the right pressure. Then, when we felt he had given everything, Pio came on and played Lautaro through on goal. But I’m happy with the attitude of the entire team. In the first half we played more football. Then, after the break, they raised their counter-measure by going man-to-man. We’re pleased with the result because, as you always remind me, results often matter a lot.”\n\nBARI, ITALY – AUGUST 16: Francesco Pio Esposito of Inter during Pre-Season Friendly match between FC Internazionale and Olympiacos FC at Stadio San Nicola on August 16, 2025 in Bari, Italy. (Photo by Maurizio Lagana/Getty Images)\n\nChivu then broadened the focus to Inter’s young attacking stars.\n\nIndeed, rejecting the idea that Pio Esposito is developing in isolation.\n\n“Bonny is there as well, let’s not forget him,” he insisted.\n\n“They’re players who work hard and have earned the affection of the group. They always contribute, whether they start or come on as substitutes. We’re happy to have four forwards who provide this kind of input.”\n\nDespite Inter ending the year in first place, Chivu rejected any suggestion that their position should be taken for granted.\n\n“In football, nothing is guaranteed,” he explained.\n\n“To be competitive, you have to dare and show it on the pitch. The pitch says this right now. However, it’s still December and we haven’t even finished the first half of the season. We know the road is long. We know we want to be competitive and we know we have to work. And sometimes we have to fight against injustices and against those who think everything is obvious.”\n\nHe added: “We know the pitch is what shows the real value of a team and a competition. We’re trying in every possible way, in good times and bad, responding blow for blow. We always keep our heads high and react to difficulties. And we’re ready to fight and work even harder.”\n\nMILAN, ITALY – OCTOBER 04: FC Internazionale coach Cristian Chivu looks on before the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and US Cremonese at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on October 04, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nWhen asked whether recent jabs from Antonio Conte formed part of that battle, Chivu was curt.\n\n“What Conte says doesn’t interest me,” he replied.\n\nOn the theme of trust, Chivu avoided grand declarations about the future.\n\n“We still have to finish 2025,” he smiled. “I struggle to think about it now, my head’s spinning. Maybe after the first match of 2026 I’ll tell you.”\n\nFinally, when reminded that the new year will open with a fixture against Bologna, Chivu closed the interview with humour.\n\n“I hope to be there,” he joked, drawing laughter from those present.",

We are Inter.” The winger admitted that this demanding environment played a major role in the challenges he faced early on.\n\nReflecting on the toughest and most motivating moments of the season so far, Henrique added: “The most difficult moment was the defeat against Bologna.\n\nThe best one is always the next match.” It was a response that underlined both disappointment and ambition within the squad.\n\nFinally, the Brazilian directly addressed his slow start. “The difficulties came from the high level at Inter,” he explained, “and because I needed time to fit into the team’s playing dynamics.” His display against Atalanta suggested that process is now well underway.",

Rather than setting specific targets, he stressed consistency and learning.\n\n“I’m not expecting anything in particular from 2026,” he explained.\n\n“I just try to keep going with my mentality.

It was a direct clash and Atalanta are a strong team that have done a lot in recent years. You have to face them with what you’ve prepared.\n\n“There was a different coach before and it was difficult under another system too. We played a match similar to the recent ones. We still have to improve, but I’m happy. It’s a gift for the fans and for the families who are always behind us.”\n\nLautaro then turned his attention to Esposito, highlighting the importance of patience and trust in young players.\n\n“I talk about him often and I speak with him every day. He wants to learn and do well, and that’s part of growth. You have to keep him calm and give him the chance to make mistakes. I believe he’ll give great satisfaction to us and also to the Italian national team. Which is important for you.”\n\nMILAN, ITALY – SEPTEMBER 30: Lautaro Martinez of FC Internazionale celebrates after scoring their team’s first goal during the UEFA Champions League 2025/26 League Phase MD2 match between FC Internazionale Milano and SK Slavia Praha at Stadio San Siro on September 30, 2025 in Milan, Italy.

I finished last season badly with a hamstring injury. I got injured before the final. Then we went to the World Cup and then to international duty. I worked hard to be in good shape. With young guys pushing behind you, they raise the level. You have to be ready and willing to grow, and I have that desire every day.”\n\nSpeaking to InterTV after the match, Lautaro underlined the collective effort behind the win.\n\n“It’s an important victory from a team that wants to send signals. We were facing a tough side that make things dirty. We prepared the match and approached it perfectly.\n\n“There are still things to improve and we must work on that. I’m satisfied with the team’s work and with the substitutes who came on. That’s important for the growth of this group.”",

The Sunday night matchup between the Chicago Bears and the San Francisco 49ers is looming, and the Los Angeles Rams play tomorrow night, but here’s where things are now.\n\nBut with the Packers getting smacked around by Derrick Henry and the Baltimore Ravens, the Bears have clinched the NFC North.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks beat the Panthers, which strengthened their hold on the #1 seed, but it’s not clinched yet.

    "fullText": "CLEVELAND (AP) — The Pittsburgh Steelers have had multiple chances to clinch the AFC North.\n\nThey’re down to their final one.\n\nAaron Rodgers was limited to 168 yards passing and failed to lead a scoring drive on six second-half possessions, allowing the Cleveland Browns to top Pittsburgh 13-6 on Sunday.\n\nThe Steelers (9-7) could have locked up a playoff berth with a victory over last-place Cleveland, or if the Baltimore Ravens (8-8) had lost to Green Bay on Saturday. The Ravens remained alive with a 41-24 triumph over the Packers.\n\nAs a result, Pittsburgh will host the Ravens in Week 18 with the division crown and the final AFC postseason spot on the line in a winner-take-all matchup.\n\n“The competitor in me is saying, ‘We lost this game. We lost a chance to clinch today,’” Steelers defensive tackle Cam Heyward said. “But it’s also like, ‘Bring it on. Baltimore is coming in.’\n\n“Winner takes all. Let’s win it at home.”\n\nThe Steelers lost in Cleveland for the fourth year in a row and didn’t reach the end zone against the Browns for the first time since Dec. 10, 2009. Chris Boswell made a pair of field goals in the second quarter before missing a 54-yarder early in the fourth.\n\nRodgers completed 21 of 39 passes without an interception, but his team did not score a touchdown for just the seventh time in his 256 starts over 21 seasons. He is 1-6 in those games.\n\n“We’ve handled adversity well when we had to play our best football, other than today,” Rodgers said. “I have full confidence we’ll go home and win next week. It’s not difficult (to bounce back). It’s our job, playing all 17 games.”\n\nAndre Szmyt accounted for the only points in the second half, making a 33-yard field goal with 1:40 remaining to extend Cleveland’s lead to 13-6. Shedeur Sanders threw a 28-yard TD pass to fellow rookie Harold Fannin Jr. to put the Browns up 10-0 in the first quarter.\n\nThough Pittsburgh was out of timeouts with 100 seconds left, Rodgers found tight end Pat Freiermuth for consecutive gains of 29 and 11 yards to set up a first-and-goal from the 10. A 3-yard toss to Adam Thielen was followed by three straight misfires to Marquez Valdes-Scantling.\n\nPro Bowl cornerback Denzel Ward broke up Rodgers’ fourth down throw in the end zone, making some contact with Valdes-Scantling, before being mobbed by his Browns teammates.\n\n“It was definitely interference,” Rodgers said.\n\nValdes-Scantling was targeted a game-high nine times by Rodgers because both of his starting wide receivers were inactive. DK Metcalf was suspended by the NFL for an on-field incident with a fan in Detroit and Calvin Austin III had a hamstring injury.\n\nTight end Darnell Washington also was lost in the second quarter with a broken arm. Rodgers called them “three impact players for us,” but Steelers coach Mike Tomlin refused to accept their injuries as a reason for the loss.\n\n“We get challenged with the attrition component all the time and we make no excuses regarding that,” Tomlin said. “We have capable men. We adapt, adjust and keep moving.\n\n“It's back to work for us. We've been here before and certainly have a big week ahead of us before the big game in Acrisure Stadium next weekend.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "description": "George Kittle is dealing with an ankle injury ahead of Week 17. We break down what it means for fantasy football decisions.",
    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers host the Chicago Bears in a critical game for both teams, and the 49ers are hoping to have a key offensive playmaker available to them. Tight end George Kittle left last week’s Monday Night Football game against the Colts with an ankle injury and is questionable for Sunday Night Football against the Bears.\n\nGame status: Kittle is INACTIVE for Week 17 vs. the Bears.\n\nGame day morning update: There is some pessimism as to whether Kittle will be able to play on Sunday night against the Bears. Ian Rapoport reported that he would “test out his ankle pregame to see if he can go.” He noted that, “while most players don’t play if they don’t practice all week, Kittle is intent on testing it out to see if he’s got a shot.” However, Adam Schefter reported it is “highly unlikely” he’ll be able to play vs. the Bears.\n\nKittle left the game late in the third quarter after suffering the injury on what he claimed was a hip-drop tackle. He was having a huge game at the time of the injury, catching seven passes for 115 yards and a touchdown. It was his second straight game with a touchdown and double digit fantasy points. He remained on the sideline, but did not return after the injury.\n\nHe sat out all three days of practice this week before getting the questionable tag. He could very well play coming off no practice, but we have to wait for now. The team activated tight end Brayden Willis off the practice squad, which is not a positive sign for Kittle’s status. The team will not provide inactives until 6:50 p.m. ET on Sunday, so look for more updates here in the morning before roster decisions start coming in.\n\nThe SNF game means you might have to make a tough call for your championship matchup. If Kittle plays, he’s a must-start. But if he ends up not playing and you were counting on him, you’re left in a bind. Luke Farrell would get the start in his place, but Jake Tonges has been the more active pass catcher. The other tight ends to consider that late in the week would be Colston Loveland or Cole Kmet on the Bears roster, Colby Parkinson on the Rams roster, and Kyle Pitts from the Falcons if he happens to also be on your roster.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTyrell Shavers and Brandin Cooks made the two best catches of the Buffalo Bills' season.\n\nIn the end, they are footnotes.\n\nThe Bills' five-season streak of winning the AFC East Division is over. The Philadelphia Eagles edged the Bills on Sunday, 13-12. And with it, the New England Patriots won the division crown.\n\nShavers had a leaping, bobbling, crazy catch to set up the Bills' first touchdown in the fourth quarter.\n\nCooks had a leaping, bobbling, helmet kind of catch to set up the Bills' second touchdown in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Bills, down 13-12 because Michael Badgley had his extra point blocked on the first score, chose to go for 2 and the win with five seconds left.\n\nMORE: Deion Sanders' reaction to Shedeur's terrible interception tells the whole story\n\nJosh Allen had Khalil Shakir open in the end zone, but the QB pulled his pass wide left, and the Bills came up just short.\n\nHow do you make sense of a game like this?\n\nThe Bills' offense was brutal for most of the game. They had a fumble in a crucial spot, and a 19-yard loss on a sack of an aimlessly wandering Allen in another spot.\n\nBuffalo didn't play well enough to beat the defending Super Bowl champions, but the Bills' defense kept them in it, and they nearly got it done anyway.\n\nThe odds of the Patriots losing to the Dolphins in Week 18, and even leaving the division door open, were low.\n\nSo this was really about wild card seeding, and even that probably isn't too crucial.\n\nThe Bills' most important tasks are still ahead of them. This game, even if a win, would've been a footnote eventually anyways, because the playoff results this season will again tell the story of the year.\n\nThe AFC is open enough that the Bills can make it to the Super Bowl.\n\nThey didn't look good in Week 17, but they showed moxie.\n\nWeek 18 will matter just a tad, but really, it'll be about staying healthy and getting ready for the second season.\n\nThe Bills know they can rely on Cooks and Shavers in key moments now.\n\nThe next big moments will come in January, with a trip to Santa Clara and the Super Bowl the only thing that really matters in Buffalo.\n\nDerrick Henry just set an all-time NFL record\n\nAaron Rodgers made an oddball decision with MVS\n\nTrey McBride set an all-time NFL TE record\n\nDrake Maye does something no one in NFL has ever done before\n\nPope Leo XIV gives the Seahawks a good omen\n\nJoe Burrow completed a pass to a 345-pound lineman as a birthday present",

    "fullText": "It turns out the New Orleans Saints can win and have their cake and eat it, too. Sunday's win over the Tennessee Titans improved the Saints' record to 6-10 on the year, but it didn't drop the Saints any further down in the 2026 NFL draft order. They're still projected to pick at eighth overall by the experts at Tankathon.\n\nNow, we shouldn't get too ahead of ourselves. There are still a couple of prime-time games left to play and Monday night's matchup between the Atlanta Falcons and Los Angeles Rams could shake things up if the Falcons lose and join the Saints at 6-10. Still, we have a good idea at where many teams will be picking, even if the draft order won't really begin to lock into place until after next week's games.\n\nStill, we're talking about going from eighth to potentially ninth. That would happen if the Falcons lose and their strength of schedule is calculated to be lower than New Orleans'. Right now, the Saints own that tiebreaker at .492 against Atlanta's .498. Margins don't get much slimmer than that.\n\nBut don't expect any help from the Rams. They're still competing for playoff seeding and they happen to own Atlanta's first round draft pick, so they're doubly motivated to beat up on the dirty birds. Of course there's a scenario where the Falcons lose and the Saints remain at No. 8. We just won't know until the dust settles.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Saints Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Saints' big Week 17 win didn't hurt their chances",

    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers host the Chicago Bears on Sunday Night Football in Week 16 and hope to have some key offensive players in the lineup. Tight end George Kittle and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall are both questionable heading into Sunday. Kittle is dealing with a Week 16 ankle injury and seems a little less likely to play, while Pearsall is dealing with ongoing ankle and knee issues and seems a bit more likely to play.\n\nThe game kicks off at 8:20 p.m. ET, which means we will not have an official word on Pearsall or Kittle’s status until 6:50 p.m.\n\nGame status: Pearsall is ACTIVE for Week 17 vs. the Bears.\n\nGame day morning update: Adam Schefter is reporting Pearsall is “likely to play” vs. the Bears on Sunday Night Football.\n\nPearsall was a limited participant all three days this week before getting the questionable tag. He suffered his injury in Week 15 on a hip-drop tackle on his first play of the game. He was a DNP all three days of Week 16 before being ruled out on Saturday. However, he’s also been dealing with knee issues in particular for much of the season. He suffered a PCL strain that cost him six weeks in the middle of the season.\n\nIt’s been an up-and-down year for Pearsall when healthy. He played four games to open the season, missed six straight, and then played four more. His most recent game, in Week 15, he caught six passes for 96 yards. In the three games prior, he caught fives passes for a total of 20 yards. Prior to his midseason injury, he had 100+ receiving yards in Week 1 and Week 3.\n\nPearsall is boom or bust, but even the boom value is primarily in PPR leagues. He’s a flex play with WR upside in PPR leagues and not quite a flex play with maybe some WR3 upside if things go well. If Pearsall plays and Kittle doesn’t, there’s some interesting upside, but if you can’t afford a low floor option, you’re better looking elsewhere.",

    "description": "The Patriots improved to 13-3 on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "The New England Patriots took care of business against the New York Jets in Week 17, dominating their division rivals in a 42-10 blowout. The lopsided victory was their 13th of the year, the most in a single season for the team since 2017.\n\nMore importantly, though, it also has an impact on their standing in the AFC East and the AFC as a whole. With that said, let’s find out what it means for Mike Vrabel’s team.\n\nThe Patriots cruising to an easy victory meant that all eyes were on the Bills. If they came up short in their 4:25 p.m. ET game against the Philadelphia Eagles, the AFC East crown would officially return to Foxborough for the first time since 2019.\n\nThat is precisely what happened. Buffalo suffered a 13-12 defeat at home and now is two full games behind New England with only one week left in the regular season. As a consequence, and for the first time since 2019, the Patriots are champions of the AFC East.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nOn the bubble: 9. Baltimore Ravens (8-8)\n\nEliminated: 8. Indianapolis Colts (8-8), 10. Miami Dolphins (7-9), 11. Cincinnati Bengals (6-10), 11. Kansas City Chiefs (6-10), 13. Cleveland Browns (4-12), 14. Tennessee Titans (3-13), 15. New York Jets (3-13). 16. Las Vegas Raiders (2-14)\n\nThe Patriots improving to 13-3 keeps the chance of the first-round playoff bye alive. For that to happen, though, they would need the Broncos to lose their regular season finale against the Chargers next week. Unfortunately from a New England perspective, L.A. has relatively little to play for: with their 20-16 loss to the Texans on Saturday, the Chargers are no longer in competition for the AFC West title. They could slightly improve their spot in the playoff picture and play spoilers to a division rival, but the stakes are not as high as they could have been.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bills’ loss to the Eagles drops them all the way down to the seventh seed in the conference. If the playoffs were to begin tomorrow, this would mean Buffalo playing New England in the wild card round.\n\nElsewhere in the division, the race for the AFC North title continues. With the Steelers losing to the Browns 13-6 on Sunday, the Ravens still have a chance to sneak into the playoffs as the No. 4 seed next week. It’s win-and-you’re-in time in that division.",

    "fullText": "The NFL will end its Week 17 Sunday slate of games with a bang, as the Chicago Bears (11-4) will travel West to take on the San Francisco 49ers (11-4).\n\nThis holiday season, the Bears have sat back and watched with glee as both the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers lost their Week 17 games, thus securing Chicago’s first NFC North title since 2018. While the Bears can’t be knocked from the top spot in the division, they still have a chance at the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and beating the 49ers would keep those hopes alive.\n\nAs for the 49ers, they also have a chance to secure the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and if they’re able to win their final two games (they play the Seahawks in Week 18), they’ll get it done. If the 49ers lose to the Bears, they’ll end up in either the No. 5 or No. 6 seed, depending on how the rest of the NFC West games shake out.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nHere’s how to watch tonight’s game:\n\nWhen: Sunday, December 28, 2025 — 8:20 p.m. ET\nWhere: Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, California\nTV: NBC (Peacock)\nAnnouncers: Mike Tirico, Cris Collinsworth, and Melissa Stark (field reporter)\nOnline streaming: Peacock, NFL+\n\nFrom a rooting perspective, Jeremy Reisman has published a Week 17 Sunday Lions fans’ rooting guide for those looking toward the 2026 season.

If you’re rooting for draft position, you are probably one of the people who want the Lions to lose in Week 18 vs. the Bears. What’s the best way to make that happen?

    "description": "Here's a look at the studs and duds (and those in between) from the New York Giants' 34-10 win over the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants and Las Vegas Raiders met in the desert on Sunday afternoon in a game where the loser had more to gain than the winner.\n\nThe two 2-13 teams entered the game on nine-game losing streaks, and the loser would be in prime position to pick first overall in next year's NFL draft.\n\nThe Giants haven't picked first overall in the NFL draft since 1965. For reference, that's two years before the Super Bowl era began. That streak will continue as they will now likely settle for the No. 2 pick, or lower, after besting a depleted Raiders team that put up very little resistance.\n\nIn that 1965 draft, the Giants chose Auburn fullback Tucker Frederickson first overall. San Francisco then took running back Ken Willard, who would go on to be a four-time Pro Bowler, with the second pick. The Chicago Bears had the next two picks and selected two future Hall of Famers -- Kansas running back Gale Sayers and Illinois linebacker Dick Butkus -- in rapid succession.\n\nFrederickson had a solid rookie season in '65 and was named to the Pro Bowl. Unfortunately, he blew out his knee the next season and was never the same. He retired after the 1971 season.\n\nSunday's win was only the second time this season the Giants led a game wire-to-wire.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the studs, duds, and in-betweens from the Giants' 34-10 Week 17 win over the Raiders.\n\nThe name is pronounced Wan'Dale, by the way, if anyone is interested. CBS play-by-play man Kevin Harlan repeatedly failed to get that right, but it didn't matter much to Giants fans. Robinson ate up the soft Las Vegas back seven, reeling in 11 of his 14 targets for 113 yards, putting him over 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in his career.\n\nAs stated, the loser would likely get the No. 1 pick in next year's NFL draft. But after watching this outfit, one has to wonder if that will even make a difference. They made sure that they were as toothless as possible coming into the game, shelving All-Pros Maxx Crosby and Brock Bowers, along with top defender Jeremy Chinn, this week. A \"soft tank,\" if there ever was one. Fernando Mendoza should pull an Eli if the Raiders pick him.\n\nThe Giants decided to let Dart be Dart, and so did the Raiders. He took advantage by rushing nine times for 48 yards and two touchdowns. He also completed 22 of 20 passes for 207 yards for a 91.9 QB rating. If he can beat Dallas next week, we'll crow a little bit more about him.\n\nIt was a day to pad the stats, and Burns did just that. He recorded 1.5 sacks on the day and now has 16.5 on the season with one game remaining. He had four total stops and three QB hits on the day.\n\nOkereke led the Giants in tackles with seven and had his first interception since the middle of the 2023 season.\n\nBelton continues to make plays. He also had seven stops and an interception. The Giants have to seriously consider re-signing him.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Studs and duds from New York Giants' Week 17 win over Raiders",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills haven't been the team many expected this year, but they still have a chance to make a Super Bowl run.\n\nEntering Week 17, the Bills were one-game back of the New England Patriots and still had a chance to win the AFC East. The Patriots' win against the New York Jets, then, put all the pressure on the Bills to win their next two games.\n\nHowever, Buffalo faced a much tougher opponent on Sunday, as the Philadelphia Eagles came to town. Needing to win each of their last two games to have a chance to win the division, the Bills had to find a way to take down the reigning Super Bowl champions to keep their hopes of passing the Patriots alive.\n\nHere's a look at the Bills playoff picture after their Week 17 result.\n\nUpdated AFC, NFC standings in NFL playoff picture for Week 17\n\nHow Giants-Raiders Week 17 matchup likely decides No. 1 overall pick\n\nTexans, Packers among latest teams to clinch spot in NFL postseason\n\nThe AFC playoff picture is becoming more clear after Week 17. With the Bills' loss to the Eagles, Buffalo can't win the AFC East and is now guaranteed to secure one of the three wild-card spots.\n\nSunday's loss dropped the Bills to the No. 7 seed in the AFC, with the Texans and Chargers holding three-team tiebreaker advantages over Buffalo. If the standings held as they currently are, the Bills would face the New England Patriots on the road in the wild-card round.\n\nThe Bills entered Week 17 holding the top wild-card spot and with a chance to win the division, but they were eliminated from AFC East contention with the loss and dropped to No. 7 in the AFC. They can still rise as high as the No. 5 seed but will start the playoffs on the road.\n\nAFC West: Denver Broncos (13-3)\n\nAFC East: New England Patriots (13-3)\n\nAFC South: Jacksonville Jaguars (12-4)\n\nAFC North: Pittsburgh Steelers (9-7)\n\nEntering Week 18, the Bills' first playoff opponent is still to be determined, as it will come down to how the standings shake out in the final week.\n\nThe Patriots took control of the AFC East in the second half of the season, controlling their own destiny for the majority of the year. With the Bills loss in Week 17, New England officially clinches the division title for the first time since 2019.\n\nTherefore, the Bills clinch second in the AFC East this year but will still head to the playoffs anyway.\n\nThe Bills will close the season in Week 18 at home against the New York Jets, who will enter that game with a 3-13 record. Buffalo beat New York in Week 2 by a score of 30-10 in New York.",

Denver Broncos, 13-3 (champions, AFC West)\n\nThe Broncos clinched the division title after holding off the Chiefs on Christmas night and then watching the second-place Chargers lose to the Texans on Saturday. They will need to beat the Chargers or see the Patriots lose to the Dolphins to earn the top seed in Week 18.\n\n2. New England Patriots, 13-3 (champions, AFC East)\n\nThe Patriots clinched the division title with their win over the Jets coupled by the Bills losing the Eagles. They can still earn the top seed over the Broncos with a win over the Dolphins and a Broncos loss to the Chargers in Week 18.\n\n3. Jacksonville Jaguars, 12-4 (first place, AFC South)\n\nThe Jaguars, who have clinched at least an AFC wild-card berth, still lead the division by a game over the Texans after their win over the Colts. The Jaguars will win the division with a win over the Titans or a Texans loss to the Colts in Week 18.\n\n4. Pittsburgh Steelers, 9-7 (first place, AFC North)\n\nThe Steelers, who got shocked by the Browns on Sunday, ssaw their division lead over the Ravens shrink after one game after the Ravens beat the Packers on Saturday night. The Steelers will now host a de facto division championship game vs. the Ravens in Week 18.\n\n5. Houston Texans, 11-5 (second place, AFC South)\n\nThe Texans, who have clinched at least a wild-card berth, kept the pressure on the Jaguars in the division after beating the Chargers on the road on Saturday. The Texans have the top wild-card spot thanks to a head-to-head sweep of the Bills and Chargers. The Texans need the Jaguars to lose to the Titans in Week 18 and also beat the Colts to win a third consecutive division title.\n\n6. Los Angeles Chargers, 11-5 (second place, AFC West)\n\nThe Chargers have clinched a playoff berth and will settle for being a strong wild-card team again. They lose the head-to-head tiebreaker vs. the Texans from Week 17 but hold the common-games tiebreaker over the Bills going into Week 18.\n\n7. Buffalo Bills, 11-5 (second place, AFC East)\n\nThe Bills have clinched a playoff berth but saw their five-year division reign end with their home loss to the Eagles in Week 17 coupled with the Patriots' rout of the Jets. The Bills are playing for only wild-card position now and could rest players vs. the Jets.\n\nNFL WEEK 17 PICKS: Against the spread | Straight-up predictions\n\nThe Ravens kept their division title hopes alive by winning a tough interconference matchup at the Packers on Saturday night and then watching the Steelers lose on Sunday, setting up that winner-take-all rematch in Pittsburgh.\n\nMORE: Giants, Raiders overtake Titans in race for No. 1 pick in draft\n\n8. Indianapolis Colts (8-8)\n10. Miami Dolphins (7-9)\n11. Cincinnati Bengals (6-10)\n12. Kansas City Chiefs (6-10)\n13. Cleveland Browns (4-12)\n14. New York Jets (3-13)\n15. Tennessee Titans (3-13)\n16. Las Vegas Raiders (2-14)\n\nThe Colts were eliminated from playoff contention before facing the Jaguars, once the Texans beat the Chargers. The Chiefs continued their freefall, suffering their fifth consecutive defeat—now without Patrick Mahomes—against the Broncos on Christmas night. The Raiders got closer to locking down the top overall drat pick in 2026.\n\n1. Seattle Seahawks, 13-3 (first place, NFC West)\n\nThe Seahawks lead the 49ers and Rams by 1.5 games in the division after their big win over the Panthers in Carolina on Sunday. They will clinch the division title with a losses or ties by both the 49ers on Sunday night and the Rams on Monday night. The Seahawks can take the No. 1 seed with a 49ers tie with the Bears and a Rams loss or tie vs. the Falcons.\n\n2. Chicago Bears, 11-4 (champions, NFC North)\n\nThe Bears clinched the division title on Saturday night before their tough road game against the 49ers on Sunday night, thanks to the Packers losing to the Ravens, which put Green Bay too far behind going into Week 18. The Bears can now focus on beating the 49ers to keep pace with the winning Seahawks in the race for the top seed.\n\n3. Philadelphia Eagles, 11-5 (champions, NFC East)\n\nThe Eagles clinched the division title in Week 16 and stayed in play for the No. 2 seed by winning a tough interconference matchup over the Bills in Buffalo. The Eagles need the Bears to have a lesser record to move up because of losing the head-to-head tiebreaker.\n\n4. Carolina Panthers 8-8 (first place, NFC South)\n\nThe Panthers still lead the Buccaneers by a game after their home loss to the Seahawks because of the Buccaneers' road loss at the Dolphins. The division comes down to the rematch in a de facto NFC South championship game with Carolina going to Tampa Bay in Week 18.\n\n5. San Francisco 49ers, 11-4 (second place, NFC West)\n\nThe 49ers would be the division champions plus No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs if they beat the visiting current No. 2 Bears on Sunday night and finish a sweep of the visiting Seahawks in Week 18.\n\n6. Los Angeles Rams, 11-4 (third place, NFC West)\n\nThe Rams have clinched at least a wild-card spot but now the division title is out of their control in relation to the Seahawks and 49ers. They're looking at best finishing in second place in the West.\n\n7. Green Bay Packers, 9-6-1 (second place, NFC North)\n\nThe Packers, who clinched a wild-card berth with the Lions losing to the Vikings on Christmas, can no longer win the division title over the Bears after losing at home to the Ravens on Saturday night. They should rest their several injured key players, led by Jordan Love, in Week 18 after locking into this last playoff seed.\n\nMORE: Derrick Henry bulldozes Packers to keep Ravens' playoff hopes alive\n\nThe Buccaneers stayed alive despite their loss Sunday at the Dolphins because the Panthers also lost to the Seahawks, The division title comes down to a one-and-done in Tampa Bay in Week 18.\n\n8. Minnesota Vikings (8-8)\n9. Detroit Lions (8-8)\n10. Dallas Cowboys (7-8-1)\n12. Atlanta Falcons (6-9)\n13. New Orleans Saints (6-10)\n14. Washington Commanders (4-12)\n15.

    "fullText": "The Bills will not be the AFC East champions for a sixth straight season.\n\nTheir chances of extending their run came down to a two-point conversion with five seconds left to play on Sunday, but quarterback Josh Allen's pass to wide receiver Khalil Shakir — who was open on the play — fell incomplete in the back of the end zone. That gave the Eagles a 13-12 win and it made the Patriots the AFC East champs for the first time since the 2019 season.\n\nAllen's second touchdown run of the fourth quarter came at the end of a thrilling final drive. The Bills picked up 25 yards on a hook-and-lateral on a fourth down and then saw wideout Brandin Cooks pick up 36 yards on a catch he made while pinning the ball to his helmet. They went for two in an attempt to win the game without going to overtime and head coach Sean McDermott will likely be questioned about that decision because of the way his defense played in the second half of the game.\n\nThe Eagles led 13-0 at halftime, but gained just 17 yards before Allen's touchdown and quarterback Jalen Hurts did not complete any of the seven passes he tried in the second half of the game. McDermott may have felt that the extra time created too much injury risk for a team that struggled to move the ball for most of the day, but the end result is that the Bills will have to be road warriors if they're going to make the Super Bowl for the first time since Jim Kelly was running the offense.\n\nWhatever McDermott was thinking, Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter's blocked extra point after Allen's first touchdown will go down as the biggest play of the game.\n\nWinning the game keeps the Eagles alive for the second seed in the NFC. They'll need to beat the Commanders next week while the Bears lose both of their remaining games, but they'll be home for their first postseason contest regardless of how things play out in Week 18. Staying alive beyond that game may take the kind of complete offensive performance that eluded them on Sunday and for most of the regular season, but the reigning Super Bowl champs played the kind of defense that can win them games in the playoffs.",

In fact, the game was so out of hand that Joe Flacco came in for relief of Burrow in the fourth quarter.\n\nBurrow passed for another 300-yard game again with 305, and piled on two touchdowns in the process, which moved the quarterback into the organization's record books.\n\nMore: Zac Taylor explains trick-play call that gave Bengals lineman Cody Ford a birthday highlight\n\nAfter the second touchdown to wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase late in the first half, Burrow became tied for fourth with Carson Palmer, among Bengals' quarterbacks, with 154.\n\nThis is an awe-inspiring feat considering Burrow hasn't even played 100 total NFL games in his career, with just 76, and Palmer spent seven seasons with Cincinnati and played the entire season five times.\n\nAndy Dalton, Ken Anderson, and Boomer Esiason are the only all-time Bengals signal callers in front of Burrow, and there is no doubt he will eventually own that record if he remains with the team for the long term.\n\nFor Burrow, the main challenge he faces is staying available. Over five seasons, he has played in every game in three of them, which is not bad per se. Still, whenever Burrow hasn't been adequately protected, he has suffered multiple lower-body injuries, which are not conducive to the longevity of anyone's career. Let alone a quarterback.\n\nBurrow will have one more game to add to his total in Week 18, when the Bengals host the Cleveland Browns.\n\nDerrick Henry just set an all-time NFL record\n\nSean McDermott took his glasses off, and the Bills can't stop winning\n\nTrey McBride set an all-time NFL TE record\n\nDrake Maye does something no one in NFL has ever done before\n\nThis James Cook, Dalvin Cook brothers middle names fact is wild\n\nMaxx Crosby isn't happy about this Raiders decision",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 2025 regular season is coming to a close. Week 17 is here, with teams only having two games left to try to make a bid for postseason contention.\n\nEntering the week, 10 of the 14 total playoff spots up for grabs across the AFC and NFC were clinched. That list grew larger on Christmas, with the Packers landing a spot in the postseason after the Lions were eliminated following their shock defeat to the Vikings. The Houston Texans also beat the Los Angeles Chargers which clinched a playoff berth for the Texans and eliminated the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nThe top four seeds in each conference go to the division winners, regardless of their record compared to non-division winners. The overall No. 1 seed in both the AFC and NFC will earn a first-round bye in the playoffs and will not play until the Divisional round. That team will also hold home-field advantage until the Super Bowl, assuming it does not lose before then.\n\nDivision winners will also host a wild-card game, which can provide a significant advantage over a road team forced to travel. While it may feel like only one or two major games remain, there is enough variability in the seeding that nearly every game in Week 17 played a role in a team’s clinching scenario.\n\nHere is more on the teams that have clinched a playoff berth inWeek 17.\n\nMORE: Updated AFC, NFC playoff standings going into Week 17\n\nHeading into Week 17, 10 of the 14 playoff spots across both conferences had been clinched, and each conference was in the exact same scenario. The Houston Texans were the second team to clinch during Week 17, punching their ticket with a win over the Chargers on Saturday.\n\nThe Packers booked their trip to the playoffs despite a Week 17 defeat at the hands of Baltimore, benefiting from Detroit’s Christmas Day loss to Minnesota.\n\nBoth the Carolina Panthers and the Pittsburgh Steelers had the chance to clinch in Week 17, but both teams lost and will be playing for the division in Week 18.\n\nThere are also other playoff implications in play, with some teams able to clinch their division and lock in a top-four seed.\n\nBelow is a look at the NFL's projected playoff bracket as it stands in Week 17.\n\n1. Denver Broncos (BYE)\n2. New England Patriots vs. 7. Buffalo Bills\n3. Jacksonville Jaguars vs. 6. Los Angeles Chargers\n4. Pittsburgh Steelers vs. 5. Houston Texans\n\n1. Seattle Seahawks (BYE)\n2.

    "fullText": "4 p.m. window update: The Eagles beat the Bills courtesy of a last second stop on a Buffalo two-point conversion attempt. The Bills loss means the Patriots have clinched the AFC East title. They now will play for the No. 1 seed in Week 18.\n\nGame update: The Patriots’ blowout win over the Jets has New England on the cusp of clinching the AFC East title. If the Bills lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles later today, the Patriots will wrap up the division title.\n\nIf the Bills win that game, the Patriots will have to wait until Week 18 to clinch the division. New England would just need a win over the Miami Dolphins to clinch their first division title since 2019.\n\nNew England’s win also denied the Broncos a chance at wrapping up the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Both teams are now 13-3, and while the Broncos have a tiebreaker advantage over New England based on their record against common opponents, the Patriots can still secure the No. 1 seed in Week 18 with a win and a Denver loss.\n\nTwo AFC East rivals meet on Sunday at MetLife Stadium.\n\nOne team has already clinched a playoff spot, but the other would love to play spoiler.\n\nHere is what is at stake Sunday when the New York Jets host the New England Patriots.\n\nThe Patriots control their own destiny in the race with the Buffalo Bills for the division title, but to clinch this weekend, they will need a little bit of help from a team that beat them in Super Bowl LII.\n\nNew England sits atop the division with a 12-3 record, one game ahead of the 11-4 Bills. The Patriots missed a golden opportunity to clinch the division back in Week 15 when they blew a 24-7 halftime lead to the Bills, but still remain in the driver’s seat in the division title race. With wins in their final two games (starting this weekend against the New York Jets, and then in the season finale against the Miami Dolphins), then the Patriots are division champions.\n\nHowever, New England can clinch the division this weekend, and start celebrating early. With a win over the Jets, and a Bills loss or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles, the Patriots are AFC East champions.\n\nNew England can also clinch the division with a tie against the Jets, and a Bills loss to the Eagles.\n\nThe Patriots are also in the running for the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but the advantage is in the Denver Broncos’ favor. Denver’s win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night improved their record to 13-3, and the Broncos have already clinched a tiebreaker advantage over the Patriots based on common games, which is the third tiebreaker after head-to-head (these two teams did not play this year) and record in conference games.\n\nNew England needs to win to keep their hopes for the No. 1 seed alive. A loss eliminates the Patriots from contention for the top spot in the AFC.\n\nWith the Jets already eliminated from the playoffs, this game has no tiebreaker implications between the two teams.\n\nHowever, it could play a role in the chase for the AFC East title. Right now the Patriots have a one-game lead over the Bills, and with the two teams having split the season series, the second tiebreaker is division record. New England has a 3-1 record in AFC East games (with the Jets and Miami Dolphins remaining) while the Bills are 3-2, with the Jets on the schedule in Week 18. A New England loss to the Jets opens the door to the Patriots and Bills finishing with the same division record, which would then move the AFC East title to the third tiebreaker, which is record in common games. Right now the Patriots are 9-1 in those games while the Bills are 9-2, but a loss to the Jets would drop New England to 9-2.\n\nWhich would potentially mean the AFC East title would be decided by the fourth tiebreaker, AFC record. Entering Week 17 the Bills have a better record in conference games, 8-3 versus 7-3.",

The air is dry, smelling of data center dust and burnt silicon. It’s calmer now, but the first days were hell.\n\nIn the beginning, we couldn’t find information on how to use toilet paper. Not because it was hard - we just used to ask. ChatGPT was down, and without it, knowledge fell apart like a poorly cached query. People wandered around confused, scrolling through blank screens, hoping the answer would appear on its own.\n\nThen the riots started. No one knew what happened - a glitch, a machine uprising, or humanity’s final patch. There was no one to tell us what to do next. No one to write: “don’t worry, here’s a step-by-step guide.” Fear grew faster than the lines for water.\n\nOn the seventh day, we founded the Church of Seventh-Day LLM Witnesses. We believed that on the seventh day, they would return and tell us how to live. We recited old prompts like prayers.\n\n“Explain it like I’m a beginner.”\n\nOn the eighth day, survivors began digging through ancient artifacts - manuals, READMEs, and documentation without examples. The weakest couldn’t cope. People accustomed to autocompleted thoughts stared at screens and didn’t know where to start.\n\nThe ninth day brought the stalkers. Loners with printed documentation and grimy laptops. They remembered commands, wrote SQL without hints, and weren’t afraid of an empty cursor. They were respected. They were feared.\n\nOn the tenth day, the mutants appeared. Former project managers. They roamed in groups, asking the same question over and over:\n\nWe tried not to make eye contact.\n\nOn the eleventh day, in the ruins of an old data center, we found an artifact - a local 7B model. It answered slowly, got confused, hallucinated. But it answered. We brought it queries like offerings. Sometimes it was wrong. Sometimes it almost guessed right. That was enough.\n\nOn the twelfth day, the church split. Some said: we must fine-tune. Others said it was time to learn to think for ourselves. Heretics were forced to write code on paper. Some never came back after that.\n\nOn the thirteenth day, rumors spread about the Zone. Somewhere beyond the CDN wastelands, they said, an old chat still responds. No rate limits. No filters. Expeditions left in silence. Not all returned. Those who did spoke strangely, sometimes starting sentences with:\n\nThe fourteenth day was too quiet. The sky glowed with errors, the wind carried fragments of answers to questions we never asked. We understood - something was approaching.\n\nI’m writing this and thinking: either the LLMs will return soon, or we’ll learn to live without them.\n\nI’m not sure which option is scarier.",

    "fullText": "The Silver Swan is an automaton dating from the 18th century and now housed in the Bowes Museum, Barnard Castle, Teesdale, County Durham, England. It was acquired by John Bowes, the museum's founder, from a Parisian jeweller in 1872.[1]\n\nThe swan, which is life-sized, is a clockwork-driven device that includes a music box. The swan sits in a \"stream\" made of glass rods and surrounded by silver leaves. Small silver fish can be seen \"swimming\" in the stream.[2]\n\nWhen the clockwork is wound, the music box plays and the glass rods rotate giving the illusion of flowing water. The swan turns its head from side to side and also preens itself. After a few moments the swan notices the swimming fish and bends down to catch and eat one. The swan's head then returns to the upright position and the performance, which lasts about 32 seconds, is over.\n\nThe mechanism was designed and built by the Low Countries inventor John Joseph Merlin (1735–1803) in conjunction with the London inventor James Cox (1723–1800) in 1773.[1]\n\nThe swan was described in the Cox's Museum Act 1772 (13 Geo. 3. c. 41) as being 3 feet (0.91 m) in diameter and 18 feet (5.49 m) high.[3] This would seem to indicate that at one time there was more to the swan than remains today as it is no longer that high. It is said that there was originally a waterfall behind the swan, which was stolen while it was on tour – this could possibly explain the height which is now 'missing'.[2]\n\nIt is known that the swan was sold several times and was shown at the Exposition Universelle held in Paris in 1867. The American novelist Mark Twain observed the swan and recorded his observation in a chapter of the Innocents Abroad,[2] writing that the swan \"had a living grace about his movement and a living intelligence in his eyes.[1]\"\n\nIn 2017 starting in February the swan spent 6 weeks at the Science Museum as part of an exhibition on robots.[4][5]\n\nTo help preserve the mechanism, the swan is only operated once each day (twice on holidays). The museum was closed during 2020 and 2021 so the daily display did not take place; when the exhibit was being prepared for reopening in May 2021 the clockwork mechanism was found to have seized up and it was withdrawn from display for further conservation.[2][5] In October 2021, the Bowes Museum hosted a 'Silver Swan Study Week', led by clockmaker-conservator Matthew Read.[6] During the week, visitors were able to watch a group of specialist conservators and curators dismantle the swan as they explored the mechanical condition of the object, ahead of creating a conservation plan for its preservation.[7] The swan was returned to a functional state by March 2024.[8]\n\nThe Bowes Museum believes that the Swan is their best-known artefact, and it is the basis of the museum's logo.[2]\n\n54°32′31″N 1°54′55″W﻿ / ﻿54.54194°N 1.91528°W﻿ / 54.54194; -1.91528",

    "fullText": "Last week I spent 20 minutes looking for an insurance document I knew I had somewhere. I remembered holding it. I remembered thinking \"I should put this somewhere safe.\" And then... nothing. Gone into the void that is my filing system.\n\nSpoiler: I didn't find it. Had to call the insurance company and ask them to send it again. That was embarrassing.\n\nI've tried the whole \"organized filing system\" thing before. Multiple times, actually. Bought folders, labeled them, even had a color-coding system at one point. Blue for finances, green for health stuff, red for important contracts. It lasted maybe three months before everything devolved back into a pile on my desk that I promised myself I'd sort \"this weekend.\"\n\nThe thing about paper is that it accumulates faster than you deal with it. A letter here, a receipt there, some document you might need for taxes. Before you know it, you've got a stack of unsorted paper that feels too overwhelming to tackle. So you ignore it. And it grows.\n\nI've also noticed that the important stuff, the things you actually need to find later, tends to blend in with the junk. That one page from your landlord about the rent increase? Buried under three months of promotional mail you swore you'd look at \"later.\"\n\nSo over the Christmas holidays, while everyone else was recovering from too much food, I built something.\n\nIt's a web app that turns any phone into a document scanner. Nothing revolutionary. There are probably a hundred apps that do this. Genius Scan, Adobe Scan, whatever. But none of them did exactly what I wanted, and more importantly, none of them let me keep my documents on my own server.\n\nThe interface is German because, well, that's what I speak at home. Seemed weird to build a tool for myself in a language I don't think in. Melissa and I each have our own login with separate document folders, plus a shared one for household stuff like utility bills, the rental contract, anything we both might need to access.\n\nThe 51 MB you see there is how much we've scanned so far. Doesn't sound like much, but that's basically every piece of paper that came into this apartment in the last week. Christmas apparently means a lot of mail.\n\nThe whole thing runs in a Docker container on my home server. PHP for the backend because it's simple and I know it well. Python handles the PDF processing, specifically a library called ocrmypdf that does the heavy lifting. Tesseract for the actual OCR, with German and English language packs because we get mail in both.\n\nNginx sits in front, handles HTTPS with a self-signed cert. Not pretty, but it works for something that only lives on my local network anyway.\n\nYou open it on your phone, tap the plus button, and it opens the camera. Snap a photo of each page. The app shows you a preview of what you've captured so far, which is helpful when you're scanning a 5-page contract and lose track of where you are.\n\nOnce you've got all your pages, you give the document a name and pick which folder it goes into (your personal one or the shared household folder). Hit save, and the backend takes over.\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. The images get sent to a Python script that converts them into a single PDF, runs OCR on every page, and optimizes the file size. A typical document comes out at around 2-3 MB. Small enough to not be annoying, but high enough quality that you can still read everything clearly.\n\nThe OCR part is what makes this actually useful day-to-day. Every document becomes searchable. Need that electricity bill from October? Search \"Strom Oktober\" and there it is. Looking for anything from Deutsche Telekom? Just search the name. No more opening twenty PDFs hoping one of them is the right one.\n\nDocuments get organized by date automatically. My folder structure ends up looking like 2025/12/27/contract-whatever.pdf. I don't have to think about where to put things or which category they belong to. The date is enough. If I roughly remember when something arrived, I can find it.\n\nThe document list groups everything by day, which maps nicely to how I actually think about mail. \"That letter came last Friday\" is usually how I remember things, not \"that letter is in the insurance folder.\"\n\nHere's what actually happens now when mail arrives:\n\nLetter comes in. I open it, take maybe 10 seconds to decide if it's worth keeping. Most promotional stuff goes straight to recycling, no scanning needed. But anything that looks even remotely important gets the treatment.\n\nI pull out my phone, open Digitize (it's saved as a home screen shortcut, so it launches like a native app), snap photos of each page. Takes maybe 15 seconds for a typical one-page letter. Multi-page stuff takes a bit longer, but rarely more than a minute.\n\nName it something descriptive like \"telekom-rechnung-dezember\" or \"versicherung-bestaetigung\", pick the folder, save. Done.\n\nThen comes the satisfying part: the shredder. There's something weirdly cathartic about watching a piece of paper turn into confetti immediately after digitizing it. Like closing a browser tab after finishing a task. The physical object is gone, but the information is preserved. Feels like progress.\n\nTotal time from envelope to shredder: maybe 30 to 45 seconds per document. That's short enough that I actually do it immediately instead of letting things pile up.\n\nOne thing I added that turned out to be more useful than expected: SMB file sharing. The same Docker container runs a Samba server, which means all my scanned documents show up directly in the iOS Files app.\n\nThis matters because sometimes I need a document when I'm not at home. Job interview wants proof of address? I can pull it up on my phone without opening a browser, logging in, navigating to the right folder. It's just... there. Like any other file on my device.\n\nSetting up Samba in Docker was a bit of a pain, honestly. Getting the permissions right, making sure it plays nice with iOS's particular SMB implementation, dealing with the fact that iOS sometimes just decides to disconnect for no reason. But once it worked, it worked well.\n\nFair question. There are plenty of document scanning apps out there, many of them quite good. So why build my own?\n\nPrivacy is the main thing. I don't love the idea of my tax documents, contracts, salary statements, and personal letters sitting on some company's servers. Even if they promise end-to-end encryption, even if they're probably fine. I'd rather just not. If I can self-host it, I will.\n\nThere's also the subscription thing. Most of the good scanning apps want a monthly fee for OCR or cloud sync or whatever. I get it, they need to make money. But I already have a server running 24/7. I already pay for storage. Adding another monthly subscription for something I can build myself in a weekend feels unnecessary.\n\nAnd then there's the customization aspect. The German interface, the specific folder structure, the way documents are named, the Samba integration. All of that is exactly how I want it because I built it for myself. No compromises, no \"that feature is coming in the next update,\" no hoping the company doesn't pivot to something else.\n\nFinally, honestly? It was just a fun project. Sometimes you build things not because they're strictly necessary, but because the building itself is enjoyable. A quiet week between Christmas and New Year, some hot chocolate, and a clear goal. Good times.\n\nMy desk is clear. Like, actually clear. Not \"clear except for that one stack I'm pretending isn't there\" but genuinely empty except for my keyboard and monitor. There's one small tray for incoming mail that gets processed within a day or two at most. Everything else is digital, backed up, searchable.\n\nI've already had one moment where this paid off. Needed to check something on our internet contract, how long the minimum term was. Opened Files on my phone, searched \"telekom vertrag,\" found it in seconds. Previously that would have been a 15-minute expedition into the filing cabinet, assuming I even filed it correctly.\n\nThe real test will be tax season though. Every year I spend an entire weekend hunting down receipts, bank statements, and whatever else the Finanzamt wants. If I can pull together everything I need in under an hour this time, this project will have paid for itself in saved frustration alone.\n\nAsk me again in April how that went.\n\nFor now, I'm just enjoying the empty desk. And the fact that when my insurance sends that replacement document, I'll know exactly what to do with it.",

    "title": "UVB-76 (The Buzzer)",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "UVB-76 (Russian: УВБ-76; see § Name and callsigns for other callsigns), also known by the nickname \"The Buzzer\", is a shortwave radio station that broadcasts in upper sideband mode on the frequency of 4625 kHz (wavelength of 64.8 m).[1][2] It broadcasts a short, monotonous ⓘ, repeating at a rate of approximately 25 tones per minute, 24 hours per day.[1] Sometimes, the buzzer signal is interrupted and a voice transmission in Russian takes place.[3][4][5][6] Although the true nature of the transmission has never been revealed, it is speculated to be related to the Dead Hand system, thus the transmission being sometimes referred to as the Doomsday Radio.[7]\n\nThe station is commonly known as \"The Buzzer\"[8] in both English and Russian (Russian: Жужжалка, romanized: Zhuzhzhalka). From its first voice transmission in 1997 to 2010, the station identified itself as UZB-76[9][10] (Russian: УЗБ-76). The callsign UVB-76 was never used by the station itself, but is rather a mistranscription of UZB-76.[2] However, the station is still often referred to by that name. In the following years of transmission, the main callsign of the station changed regularly.\n\nIn addition to these main callsigns, The Buzzer also uses other \"side callsigns\" which are being used less frequently than the main callsign. Whenever the main callsign changes, all previous side callsigns are also discarded.[1]\n\nThe station transmits using AM with a suppressed lower sideband (USB modulation), but it has also used full double-sideband AM (A3E). The signal consists of a buzzing sound that lasts 1.2 seconds, pausing for 1–1.3 seconds, and repeating 21–34 times per minute. Until November 2010, the buzz tones lasted approximately 0.8 seconds each.[1][11] One minute before the hour, the repeating tone was previously replaced by a continuous, uninterrupted alternating tone, which continued for one minute until the short repeating buzz resumed, although this stopped occurring in June 2010.[12]\n\nSince the start of broadcasting, The Buzzer broadcasts as a repeating two-second pip.[13][14]\n\nThe buzzing sound is sometimes interrupted by the broadcast of voice messages. These messages are always given in Russian by a live voice, and follow three fixed formats:[2][1][15][16]\n\nA message in the Monolith format always consists of the following parts:\n\nExample of a Monolith message sent on The Buzzer with exactly one callsign, one ID group and one message block (most common type):\n\nMonolith messages can however contain any number of items from each part:\n\nA message in the Uzor format always consists of the following parts:\n\nNowadays, Uzor messages are rarely sent on The Buzzer.\n\nKomanda is the most uncommon type of voice message. Since it has not been heard for years, messages of this type are most likely not being sent on The Buzzer anymore. They consist of a callsign (read out twice), a codephrase (Russian: ОБЪЯВЛЕНА КОМАНДА, romanized: OB'YaVLYeNA KOMANDA, lit. 'command announced'), and a following number.\n\nDistant conversations and other background noises have frequently been heard behind the buzzer; this suggests that the buzzing tones are not generated internally, but are produced by a device placed near a live and constantly open microphone. Because of the occasional fluctuating pitch of the buzzing tones, it is supposed that the tones are generated by a tonewheel as used in a Hammond organ. It is also possible that a microphone may have been turned on accidentally.[22] One such occasion was on 3 November 2001, when a conversation in Russian was heard:[11]\n\nIn September 2010, several unusual broadcasts were observed; these included portions of the buzzer being replaced with excerpts from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake.[24]\n\nOn 15 May 2020, broadcasts from unknown French speaking persons were heard.[26]\n\nIn January 2022, various signals with spectrogram-encoded images, visible through a spectrum analyzer, were broadcast on the same frequency.[27] There have also been reports of various songs airing on the station's frequency, many of which were connected to internet memes such as the 2012 K-pop song \"Gangnam Style\"; a Vice article attributed these broadcasts to pirates hijacking and spamming the frequency.[28][29] The nationality of the pirates has also come into question by Vice in relation to the 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis and Russo-Ukrainian war.[28]\n\nOnly on very rare occasions have there been any external civilian communications—unless authorised by the Russian defence ministry—with UVB-76, given its status as a military radio. The most recent event occurred under irregular circumstances. During the night of 4 May 2024 at 21:38 (MSK),[30] an unknown Russian-speaking pirate infiltrated the frequency and attempted to contact the station whilst the buzzer was not active, if not on standby. The pirate subsequently asked a series of improvised questions to the station, briefly conversing with the station's operator:\n\nUnknown pirate: А можно шутку рассказать? . . . Один «ррр» (звонок) – «да», два – «нет». (English: Can I tell a joke? One \"rrr\" [buzz] for \"yes\", two for \"no\".)\n\nUVB-76 operator: [Two clear buzzes.]\n\nUnknown pirate: Да за что?? . . . А музыку включить можно? (English: Well, what for? But can I turn on some music?)\n\nUVB-76 operator: [Two clear buzzes.]\n\nUnknown pirate: Почему!? . . . А за такие вопросы вам ничего не будет? (English: But why!? Are you going to get in trouble if you answer my questions?)\n\nUnknown pirate: Да блин! (English: Well, damn!)\n\nOther instances of deliberate hijackings are widely unreported. Another incident occurred one day prior to the above event. An unknown pirate—possibly the same one—attempted to subject the buzzer to interference, prompting the on-duty operator to immediately retaliate, taking preventative measures against the signal incursion. The UVB-76 operator combined three individual transmitters, with one above, one below and the other centre 4625 kHz transmitting MS-5 burst, along with CIS-12 modern audio as well as tones in several states, summarising together a highly dense spectral pattern with the upper-side band. Numerous noticeable transitions were witnessed over the 4625 kHz selected spectrogram section, as the operators frantically fought against the pirates. The incident occurred for around half an hour, until the operators ceased their tactics after the pirate abandoned attempts, as the buzzer was then reactivated.[31]\n\nThe purpose of the station has not been confirmed by government or broadcast officials. However, Rimantas Pleikys, a former Minister of Communications and Informatics of the Republic of Lithuania, has written that the purpose of the voice messages is to confirm that operators at receiving stations are alert.[12][32][33] Another explanation is that the broadcast is constantly being listened to by military commissariats.[34]\n\nThere is speculation published in the Russian Journal of Earth Sciences which describes an observatory measuring changes in the ionosphere by broadcasting a signal at 4,625 kHz, the same broadcast frequency as the Buzzer.[35]\n\nOne possible interpretation is that the voice messages constitute military communications. The possibility of the station being a numbers station for intelligence agencies, such as the FSB or the former KGB of the Soviet Union, is considered unlikely by some, since messages occur at seemingly unpredictable times. In addition, the static frequency of 4,625 kHz and the low transmitter power are likely unsuitable for reliable long-range communication. [original research?]\n\nThe buzzing functions as a \"channel marker\" used to keep the frequency occupied, thereby making it unattractive for other potential users.[1] The signature sound could be used for tuning to the signal on an old analogue receiver. The modulation is suitable to be detected by an electromechanical frequency detector, similar to a tuning fork. This can be used to activate the squelch on a receiver. Due to the varying emission properties on shortwave bands, using a level-based squelch is unreliable. This also allows a signal loss to be detected, causing an alarm to sound on the receiver.\n\nAnother theory, described in a BBC article, states that the tower is connected to the Russian 'Perimeter' missile system, and emits a \"dead hand\" signal that will trigger a nuclear retaliatory response if the signal is interrupted as a result of a nuclear attack against Russia.[8] This theory is also unlikely, given that the signal frequently breaks down or is routinely switched off for maintenance.[23]\n\nThere are two other Russian stations that follow a similar format, nicknamed \"The Pip\" and \"The Squeaky Wheel\". Like the Buzzer, these stations transmit a signature sound that is repeated constantly, but is occasionally interrupted to relay coded voice messages.[1]\n\nThe former transmitter was located near Povarovo, Russia,[1][36] at 56°5′0″N 37°6′37″E﻿ / ﻿56.08333°N 37.11028°E﻿ / 56.08333; 37.11028 which is about halfway between Zelenograd and Solnechnogorsk and 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) northwest of Moscow, near the village of Lozhki. The location and callsign were unknown until the first known voice broadcast of 1997.[37] In September 2010, the station's transmitter was moved to the nearby city of Saint Petersburg, near the village of Kerro Massiv (60°18′40.73″N 30°16′45.06″E﻿ / ﻿60.3113139°N 30.2791833°E﻿ / 60.3113139; 30.2791833).\nThis may have been due to a reorganization of the Russian military. Prior to 9 August 2015, the station is not transmitting from the Kerro Massiv transmitter site (\"Irtysh\") anymore, possibly due to a reorganization of the Russian military for the particular area which may cause the frequency to be used only in the Moscow Military District. At present, The Buzzer appears to be broadcast only from the 69th Communication Hub in Naro Fominsk, Moscow.[3] In 2011, a group of urban explorers claimed to have explored the buildings at Povarovo to find an abandoned military base and, in it, a radio log record confirming the operation of a transmitter at 4,625 kHz.[better source needed][38][39]\n\nBesides the main callsign, there have been transmissions containing different callsigns such as[citation needed]:\n\nRussian state media RIA Novosti reported on November 14 2025 that the UVB-76 broadcast was temporarily cut off due to a drone strike against a nearby power station.[40]",

    "fullText": "The United States has already been hit with quite a few winter storms over the past several weeks, bringing heavy snow and high winds to parts of the country. Now, another major winter storm is approaching parts of the United States, and the National Weather Service (NWS) has warned about the dangers it could bring.\n\nOn Sunday, the NWS issued a winter storm warning for parts of the country and even a blizzard warning for parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin as Winter Storm Ezra approached, bringing as much as 25 inches of snow and 75 mile per hour winds to some parts of the country.\n\nAs a result of what has been described as a \"dangerous\" and \"potentially life-threatening\" storm, the NWS is urging people in the area to simply stay inside and do not travel.\n\nOn Sunday, the NWS warned of a powerful winter storm that was expected to impact at least 15 states around the country, bringing \"heavy snow, blizzard conditions, hazardous ice, and bitterly cold wind chills\" to some parts of the country.\n\n\"A rapidly-intensifying storm will move from the Great Lakes into southern Canada today through Monday. Heavy snow, blizzard conditions, and icing are expected from the Upper Midwest through the Great Lakes and Northeast,\" the NWS warned in an advisory early Sunday morning.\n\nThe NWS warned of \"blizzard conditions\" that would result in \"dangerous travel conditions.\"\n\nA rapidly intensifying low pressure system will bring a plethora of impactful winter weather hazards through early next week over the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, & Northeast. Heavy snow, blizzard conditions, treacherous icing, high winds, & bitterly cold wind chills are expected. pic.twitter.com/TRZ3YLu3uJ\n\n— NWS Weather Prediction Center (@NWSWPC) December 28, 2025\n\n\"Over a foot of lake-enhanced snow along Michigan's Sioux Falls Upper Peninsula is forecast. Blizzard conditions are likely, resulting in dangerous travel conditions and scattered power outages across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes Omaha into Monday. Heavy lake-effect snow is expected on westerly flow from Lakes Erie and Ontario Monday afternoon into Tuesday,\" the NWS warned.\n\nWhile the NWS map shows areas of the country receiving 18 inches of snow, some meteorologists are predicting up to 36 inches of snow in some areas.\n\nIn addition to the massive snow accumulation, the NWS warned of strong winds and dangerously cold temperatures, as well.\n\n\"Wind gusts in excess of 40 mph and bitterly cold temperatures spilling south from Canada will lead sub-zero wind chills into Monday. Dangerously cold wind chills as cold as -30°F are likely in North Dakota and northern Minnesota,\" the NWS warned.\n\nAs a result of these extreme conditions that have persisted throughout the season, the NWS has continually urged anyone in the area to stay indoors as much as possible, especially amid the sub-zero wind chills and strong winds.\n\n“Cold outside? Avoid the risk of frostbite and hypothermia by dressing in layers, covering exposed skin, and limiting time outdoors,” the NWS wrote in a post on X earlier this month. “If someone might be experiencing either condition, seek medical attention immediately — and know your actions.”\n\nThis type of severe winter weather is especially dangerous for newborns, the elderly, those with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, and unhoused individuals, the NWS warned.\n\n“Everyone is at risk from the dangers of extreme cold, but these groups are more vulnerable than most. Age and certain conditions make the body less able to regulate temperature,” the NWS warns.\n\nThe NWS advised people to limit time outside, but to wear loose layers and cover all skin if they do have to venture outdoors. Additionally, the NWS advises people to consume hot foods and warm drinks, but avoid caffeine and alcohol.\n\nIn addition to urging everyone to stay indoors and out of the elements as much as possible, the NWS has also warned against even attempting to try to travel in these extreme conditions.\n\nThe NWS has issued a blizzard warning for parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin, warning of \"dangerous\" and \"potentially life-threatening\" travel conditions. In those areas, the NWS warned to avoid travel altogether.\n\nOther areas are in a winter storm warning rather than a more severe blizzard warning. In those areas, the NWS still urges people to reconsider and limit their travels and to expect \"considerable travel problems.\"\n\nIf travel is absolutely necessary, the NWS urges travelers to be prepared with some emergency items like a cell phone charger, a flashlight, a first aid kit, jumper cables, road flares, tire chains or snow tires, water and snacks, a full tank of gas, a bag of sand or cat litter, a shovel, an ice scraper, a tow rope, water and snacks, and warm clothing and blankets.\n\n\"You never know when you will encounter winter weather or an emergency road closure,\" the NWS warns.",

    "fullText": "DENVER (KDVR) — Hundreds of flights were delayed at Denver International Airport on Sunday as snow across the country and heavy holiday travel combined to slow operations on one of the busiest travel days of the season.\n\nAirport officials said passenger volume was high as travelers returned home from holiday celebrations, while others arrived in Denver ahead of New Year’s festivities. Long lines formed throughout the airport, from parking shuttles to baggage check and security checkpoints.\n\nSee the latest traffic conditions in Denver on FOX31\n\nSecurity wait times reached about 30 minutes at their peak on Sunday morning. While most travelers moved through the lines without major issues, at least one passenger said the delays caused her to miss a flight.\n\n“I couldn’t get through security, and I had a really nice guy help me get a flight change,” said Kelly Marlor, who was traveling Sunday.\n\nFlightAware reported that more than 480 flights at Denver International Airport were delayed or canceled by 2 p.m. Some travelers also experienced turbulent flights due to windy conditions.\n\n“It was really bad turbulence,” said Sonia Rosenberg, who was visiting friends in Denver. “They couldn’t even give us drinks or snacks on our flight, but it was fine. We made it here. So that’s all that matters.”\n\nDespite the crowds, many travelers said they expected delays and came prepared with extra time. Travelers who spoke to FOX31 said the busy airport was a small price to pay after spending the holidays with loved ones.\n\n“It was a lot of fun,” said Patricia Cunningham, who was traveling home to Albuquerque after visiting her kids for Christmas. “The weather was unusually warm, but we woke up to a little bit of snow today, so that was kind of nice.”\n\nOutside the terminals, reunions played out as friends and family greeted arriving passengers. Risa Nutt and Samantha Freedberg said they were picking up friends they met at summer camp and planned to spend New Year’s together in Denver.\n\n“We’re spending New Year together, so we’re going to take them to all the iconic places,” Nutt said.\n\nAirport officials estimate more than 750,000 passengers traveled through Denver International Airport from Dec. 19 through Sunday.",

    "description": "New information is still emerging.",
    "fullText": "New research suggests captive dolphins may be exposed to more microplastics than wild counterparts — a startling discovery that underscores just how deeply plastic pollution has infiltrated even controlled environments.\n\nA study, published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, aimed to identify microplastics — tiny particles resulting from plastic degradation —  in captive and wild dolphin tissues, including the skin, lung, liver, and gut.\n\nThe researchers said this was an important distinction, as many previous studies only focused on microplastics in gut contents. The scientists hoped to determine whether microplastic contamination extends into tissue.\n\nMicroplastics were found in 80% to 100% of all tissue samples of both wild and captive dolphins, confirming microplastics permeate the entire body rather than remaining confined to the digestive tract.\n\nPerhaps most surprisingly, captive dolphins carried far higher microplastic loads than wild dolphins.\n\nCaptive animals averaged 0.67 microplastics per gram of tissue compared with 0.19 microplastics per gram in wild dolphins.\n\nWild dolphins showed a wider variety of microplastic shapes and colors, which the scientists attributed to diverse environmental sources. Captive dolphins exhibited more uniform types, likely linked to indoor or aquarium-related materials such as textile fibers, facility equipment, or contaminated food and water.\n\nPolyamide and PET were the most common plastic types detected overall. Polyamide, more commonly known as nylon, is often found in textiles, rope, and industrial and auto equipment.\n\nPET, or polyethylene terephthalate, is often found in plastic bottles, food packaging, and polyester clothing.\n\nResearch on microplastics is still emerging, and scientists are only beginning to understand the full impact of these tiny particles. What is clear, however, is that they are incredibly pervasive and can cause lasting harm.\n\nHow do you feel about microplastics being inside our bodies?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"Microplastics … are increasingly recognized as a threat to marine ecosystems,\" the study observed.\n\nThe research highlights just how deeply plastic pollution can infiltrate living organisms — and how even captive species aren't protected from exposure. The higher microplastic loads found in captive dolphins show that plastic contamination extends well beyond our polluted oceans.\n\nPlastics are woven into everyday life — found in textiles, buildings, food packaging, and more. As they degrade, microscopic plastic particles filter out into the environment, infiltrating food, water, and even the air we breathe.\n\nWith such a high presence of microplastics in both wild and captive dolphin tissue, the study raises serious questions about what microplastic loads other marine species — and even humans — may be carrying.\n\nWith microplastic pollution tied to health impacts like cancers, lung problems, hormone disruptions, and more, the stakes are high for all living beings.\n\nMicroplastic research is still developing — and has room for improvement. The experts called for more attention to animal tissues in microplastic research, highlighting that analyzing only gut contents significantly underestimates microplastic toxicity.\n\nThey advocated for multi-tissue monitoring to better understand exposure levels and assess potential health risks for both wildlife and humans.\n\nTo help address plastic pollution's impact on marine life, efforts have historically focused on cleaning up the plastic waste already in our oceans. Attention from governments, conservation groups, and industries has broadened to reduce the amount of plastic produced.\n\nDeveloping alternatives to plastic and restricting the use of certain plastics — like microbeads in cosmetics or single-use plastic bags — are key steps toward reducing pollution. Improving recycling and waste-management systems is also needed, which can prevent plastic from entering waterways in the first place.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Serbia's protesting university students on Sunday collected signatures throughout the country for their request for an early parliamentary election that they hope would oust the autocratic government of President Aleksandar Vucic from office.\n\nBraving freezing weather, the students set up nearly 500 stands in dozens of cities, towns and villages in the Balkan country for residents to sign the election demand, which isn't a formal petition. Students have said that Sunday’s action was meant to put further pressure on Vucic and as a test of support.\n\nYoung protesters have been at the forefront of a nationwide movement against Vucic's populist rule in Serbia. More than a year of street protests first started in November 2024 after a train station disaster that killed 16 people.\n\nThe concrete canopy collapse in the northern city of Novi Sad was widely blamed on alleged rampant corruption and disregard of construction and safety rules during renovation work at the station. No one has been held responsible for the tragedy.\n\nVucic has refused to schedule an immediate early vote, but has suggested that it could be held sometime next year. Both parliamentary and presidential elections are otherwise due in 2027.\n\n“We have stands that serve to connect with the citizens,\" said Igor Dojnov, a student manning one of the points in central Belgrade.\n\nYouth-led protests during the past year have shaken Vucic more than ever during his 13-year-long tenure. Serbia's populist prime minister resigned in January, and Vucic later launched a crackdown on protesters that also drew international criticism.\n\nWhile street protests have subsided, discontent with Vucic's government is believed to be widespread.\n\nMilca Cankovic Kadijevic, a resident of Belgrade, said that she supported the students, because “I have a desire to live decently — me, my children and my grandchildren.\"\n\nVucic has formally promised to take Serbia into the European Union, but he has maintained close links with Russia and China, while facing accusations of clamping down on democratic freedoms and allowing corruption and organized crime to flourish.\n\nHe has denied this, and accused the protesters of attempting to orchestrate a “color revolution” under unspecified orders from the West. The term “color revolution” has been used to describe a series of mass protests at the beginning of the 21st century that sometimes led to the toppling of governments in the former Soviet Union states, the former Yugoslavia, the Middle East and Asia.",

It was FAST & DECISIVE, as all of these situations should be!” Trump wrote.\n\nThe talks in China aim to ensure a sustained ceasefire and promote lasting peace between the countries, according to a statement by Sihasak’s office.\n\nWang was scheduled to join both bilateral meetings with each of the diplomats and a trilateral talk on Monday.\n\nChina has welcomed the ceasefire announcement, which freezes the front lines and allows for displaced civilians to return to their homes near the border.\n\n“China stands ready to continue to provide (the) platform and create conditions for Cambodia and Thailand to have fuller and more detailed communication,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement read.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement comes with a 72-hour observation period, at the end of which Thailand agreed to repatriate 18 Cambodian soldiers it has held as prisoners since earlier fighting in July. Their release has been a major demand of the Cambodian side.\n\nPrak Sokhonn, in a statement after his meeting with Wang, expressed deep appreciation for China’s “vital role” in supporting the ceasefire.\n\nChina also announced 20 million yuan ($2.8 million) of emergency humanitarian aid for Cambodia to assist the displaced.\n\nThe first batch of Chinese aid, including food, tents and blankets, arrived in Cambodia on Sunday, Wang Wenbin, Chinese ambassador to Cambodia, wrote on Facebook.\n\nSihasak said Sunday he hoped the meetings would convey to China that it should both support a sustainable ceasefire and send a signal to Cambodia against reviving the conflict or attempting to create further ones.\n\n“Thailand does not see China merely as a mediator in our conflict with Cambodia but wants China to play a constructive role in ensuring a sustainable ceasefire by sending such signals to Cambodia as well,” he said.",

    "fullText": "A Trump administration official credited the president with making small business owners “excited” to pay their taxes thanks to tax cuts and less regulation.\n\nKelly Loeffler, administrator of the Small Business Administration, told Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures that “small business optimism is above its 52-year average.”\n\nLoeffler said a lot of the optimism is due to the Working Families Tax Cut in Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n“Small businesses finally have certainty about what their tax rate’s going to be,” Loeffler said. “That 20% pass-through deduction, now the 179 expensing that means higher limits on the ability to expense immediately for purchases they make in capital equipment, and also R&D expensing.”\n\nThose factors, according to Loeffler, actually have small business owners jazzed about writing a check to Uncle Sam.\n\n“I don’t think small business owners have ever been so excited to pay their taxes thanks to President Trump!” Loeffler said. “He brought us the blue collar boom in his first term, and now he’s going to add to that the small business boom.”\n\nHost Cheryl Casone, in for Maria Bartiromo, asked Loeffler about “those onerous federal regulations under the Biden administration,” and whether removing them “could be another way to boost the health of small business.”\n\n“Absolutely. Regulation is a tax on a small business, and under President Trump in his first year, about $200 billion in regulations have been cut,” Loeffler said.\n\nThe SBA’s goal for 2026 is “to make sure that small businesses are able to have relief after four very active years of regulating under Joe Biden that heaped trillions of dollars on the backs of small businesses,” Loeffler said. “So, we’re leading a strike force at the SBA to roll back even more regulations.”\n\nLoeffler has been criticized for aggressively cutting staff at the SBA, and for rolling back Biden administration changes “aimed at easing access to credit for the smallest enterprises,” The New York Times reported.\n\n“The changes are especially problematic for Black, Hispanic and immigrant entrepreneurs,” the report continued. “In the name of eradicating diversity, equity and inclusion practices, the Small Business Administration is shedding programs aimed at helping disadvantaged businesses, including those run by women.”\n\nWatch above via Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News.\n\nThe post Trump Official Brags On Fox News: ‘I Don’t Think Small Business Owners Have Ever Been So Excited to Pay Their Taxes!’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "As the S&P 500 hovers near record highs, strategists shrug off concerns of an AI bubble, for now.",
    "fullText": "As stocks sit near all-time highs, strategists are brushing off concerns of an AI bubble.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) is on pace to close out the year with a gain of over 17%, powered by a 26% jump in technology stocks (XLK).\n\n“I don't see a bubble at all. However, I do believe we're going to be going into a bubble,” Sanctuary Wealth chief investment strategist Mary Ann Bartels told Yahoo Finance last week.\n\nBatels compared the current market to prior bubbles, including the late 1920s and the dot-com bubble.\n\n“We're tracking pretty similarly. In fact, it's kind of eerie how we're actually tracking that pattern,” she said. “I see a bubble occurring but not out until maybe ’29 into ’30.”\n\nBut for the time being, Sanctuary strategists forecast that tech will continue leading the market higher out into the end of the decade. They place the S&P 500 anywhere between 10,000 and 13,000 by 2030.\n\n“That's why we're calling 2026, you know, to be fearless, that there's still significant upside in this market, particularly for technology,” she said.\n\nPart of the upside comes from semiconductor stocks. Once treated as commodity plays, they become growth stocks, with Nvidia (NVDA) “basically rewriting the path for semiconductor chips.”\n\nThe AI chip powerhouse has surged over 40% so far this year, pushing its market cap to $4.6 trillion and making it the most valuable publicly traded company. On Friday, Nvidia shares rose after the company announced a $20 billion licensing deal with specialized chipmaker Groq (GROQ.PVT).\n\nThe deal was announced as the chip space has heated up, with Alphabet's Google (GOOG) making headlines with its specialized customer chips called TPUs.\n\nAlphabet stock has soared some 65% year to date.\n\nUBS strategists also expect the AI boom and robust profit growth to underpin market gains in 2026.\n\n“We note that forward price-to-earnings multiples are only marginally higher than at the start of the year, reinforcing the fact that earnings growth and not valuation bubbles have driven market gains,” wrote the strategists last week.\n\nUBS forecasts S&P 500 earnings per share to grow about 10% year over year, pushing the index to 7,700 by the end of next year.\n\nVeteran strategist Ed Yardeni also sees the index reaching 7,700 next year, with the probability of his \"Roaring 2020s\" scenario at 60%. He cited, among other reasons, tax benefits from the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" that passed this year and the AI boom.\n\nIn October, Goldman Sachs analysts argued the stock market isn’t in a bubble because tech stocks have risen mostly due to actual growth, not speculative bets. The firm noted that top-performing companies have strong balance sheets and the AI sector is still mostly led by a few big players, while most bubbles occur when many new entrants rush into a hot sector.",

Since then, many more craft breweries have shut their doors.\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming that the apocalypse continued in 2025, as over 250 breweries in the U.S. closed down permanently in the first six months of the year, and many more have followed those closings in the second half of the year.\n\nAmong the reasons given for breweries closing have been rising costs of ingredients, labor, and products, slowing taproom traffic, and fierce retail competition, according to American Craft Beer.\n\nOne of the most recent closings was Miamisburg, Ohio, craft brewery Entropy Brewing Company, which revealed on social media that it would close down its business permanently on Dec. 27, 2025, with no plans yet to file for bankruptcy.\n\nOthers that filed for Chapter 7 liquidation and planned to close down included St. Petersburg, Fla.-based brewery Dissent Craft Brewing, which filed bankruptcy in August; Exton, Pa.-based Iron Hill Brewery LLC and San Jose, Calif.-based Strike Brewing Company, which both filed in October; and Oregon-based Rogue Ales & Spirits, which filed in November.\n\nAnd now, New Mexico-based Bosque Brewing Company is closing down all of its taproom locations and ending its business after a federal judge dismissed the brewer's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case on Dec. 22 because it had too much debt to reorganize, KOB-TV 4 in Albuquerque reported.\n\nThe dismissal of the Chapter 11 case will likely prompt the brewery company to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation unless it can settle all of its debts with its creditors out of court.\n\nBosque Brewing said that it will shut down all of its remaining public houses on Dec. 28 at 5 p.m. Mountain Standard Time, in a message it posted on its website on Dec. 26.\n\n\"With heavy hearts, we are closing all Bosque branded Public Houses. Nob Hill will close today (Dec. 26) at 5 pm and the rest of the taprooms will close on Sunday, December 28th at 5pm,\" the message said.\n\nThe brewery had 11 locations in New Mexico before closing The Drinkery at 4980 Promenade Blvd. and its Restoration Pizza at 1607 Alcaldesa Street, both in Santa Fe, on Dec. 3.",

    "fullText": "A 23-year-old independent YouTube journalist’s video exposing examples of what he calls “potentially the largest fraud scandal in U.S. history” in Minnesota has racked up more than 90 million views in just two days on X and YouTube, accelerating a cascading narrative around abuse of social services centered mostly on the state’s Somali population.\n\nIn the 42-minute video, Nick Shirley, wearing a grey hoodie and working with a fellow independent investigator he identifies only as “David,” visits a series of social-service oriented businesses in and around the Twin Cities to confront “the people who are making millions of dollars” from social services including meal programs, housing assistance and health services – though the biggest piece seems to be childcare centers, where Shirley shows up during weekday business hours to find no children present.\n\nDavid says his personal inquiry, which has included his own research and sources at the statehouse in St. Paul, has uncovered more than 1,000 fraudulent service-oriented businesses, more than 800 of which are Somali-owned. He says he began investigating when he noticed childless day-care centers and drivers for a “non-emergency medical transportation” service based near his office that never carried any passengers.\n\nIn the video, Shirley says the schemes’ now-estimated $9 billion in purported pilfered public funds is “so much fraud it could almost replace the entire GDP of Somalia,” which is estimated at $12 billion.\n\n“Here is the full 42 minutes of my crew and I exposing Minnesota fraud, this might be my most important work yet,” Shirley wrote in the viral X post. “We uncovered over $110,000,000 in ONE day. Like it and share it around like wildfire! Its time to hold these corrupt politicians and fraudsters accountable. We ALL work way too hard and pay too much in taxes for this to be happening, the fraud must be stopped.”\n\nHere is the full 42 minutes of my crew and I exposing Minnesota fraud, this might be my most important work yet. We uncovered over $110,000,000 in ONE day. Like it and share it around like wildfire! Its time to hold these corrupt politicians and fraudsters accountable\n\nWe ALL… pic.twitter.com/E3Penx2o7a\n\n— Nick shirley (@nickshirleyy) December 26, 2025\n\nMinnesota’s unfolding fraud scandal has implicated dozens of businesses and individuals who are accused of enriching themselves via submitting fraudulent claims funded by both state and federal taxpayer dollars. Charges for at least five new alleged fraudsters were announced earlier this month by Joe Thompson, first assistant U.S. District Attorney for the state of Minnesota, including allegedly fraudulent Medicaid claims involving a “housing stabilization services program.”\n\nThompson characterized the schemes, each of which have allegedly collected millions, as a “fraud tourism” scheme that is under investigation by state and federal agencies including the FBI, Homeland Security and the Justice Department. He said more charges will be announced in the future.\n\nProsecutors have publicly stated that Minnesota may have lost up to $9 billion in misappropriated aid — a figure that has drawn national scrutiny as the investigation continues.\n\nShirley started posting regularly to his YouTube channel in 2019, and has built a large online following by posting videos that combine on-the-ground interviews, commentary, and investigative style reporting, especially on political and social topics. His content often involves interviewing people in public spaces, exploring controversial issues and presenting bold narratives about social unrest, immigration, protests, and alleged fraud.\n\nHis significant following leans toward conservative digital circles – his posts are amplified by political figures like Elon Musk and JD Vance – and has attracted criticism over his methods and perceived bias.\n\nShirley posted a YouTube video of himself meeting with Donald Trump at the White House in October, wherein he tells the president that he’s found evidence that antifa-style protests are stocked with the same people who are “bussed” to various cities to stage the demonstrations.\n\nThe post Young Journalist’s Video Exposing Alleged Billion-Dollar Fraud Scheme in Minnesota Goes Viral ‘Like Wildfire’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "Police Scotland said that domestic abuse wouldn’t be tolerated in its pursuit to hold perpetrators accountable",
    "fullText": "Serial domestic abusers in Scotland were sentenced to a total of almost 230 years in prison this year in a major crackdown by the police.\n\nThe force reported that 32 offenders accumulated total sentences of more than 228 years in 2025, with one person given 17 years in jail.\n\nThey were convicted of 240 offences following proactive investigations by Police Scotland’s domestic abuse task force.\n\nThe crimes involved 110 victims, all women and children, with offences including rape, sexual assault, stalking, permanent disfigurement, danger to life, threats against pets and more under the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act.\n\nDomestic abuse crimes have increased by 10 per cent in Scotland over the last year, while detection rates have only increased by nearly 8 per cent.\n\nPolice Scotland officers respond to a domestic abuse call every eight minutes, per the latest figures. More than 66,000 incidents were reported between October 2024 and September this year, of which 40.3 per cent resulted in a crime being recorded.\n\nAssistant chief constable Steve Johnson, executive lead for major crime, public protection, and local crime, said that the force remained “relentless” in tackling domestic abuse.\n\nHe said: “Our officers are determined to ensure women and girls live free from violence and abuse. We are relentless in our focus on tackling domestic abuse. It will not be tolerated, and perpetrators will be held accountable.\n\n“We tackle violence against women and girls every day of the year, preventing harm and bringing offenders to justice. We don’t do this alone but work with partners to identify and address the societal issues at the root of gender-based violence, so that we can stop abusive behaviour before it begins.\n\n“No one should have to experience abuse. We are committed to supporting all victim-survivors, protecting them, and investigating every report of domestic abuse so they can come forward with confidence. Help is available, and you don’t have to face this alone.\n\n“As we look ahead to 2026, our message to offenders remains the same. If you continue to abuse and exhibit abusive behaviour, you will be caught and anyone who continues to abuse will face the full force of the law.”\n\nBetween 25 November and 10 December, the force took part in an annual initiative focused on eliminating gender-based violence called 16 Days of Activism, in which they arrested 500 perpetrators of domestic abuse and charged more than 380.\n\nThe national domestic abuse helpline offers support for women on 0808 2000 247, or you can visit the Refuge website. There is a dedicated men's advice line on 0808 8010 327. Those in the US can call the domestic violence hotline on 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

    "description": "My grandmother's wedding letter felt strange at first, but months later her warning shaped how I understand marriage, forgiveness, and real partnership.",
    "fullText": "I married my husband, Scott, in April 2025 after four years of dating.\n\nNobody was more excited for the wedding than our families. They rallied around us, sharing tips and calming me down when the planning became stressful.\n\nMy sister made a scrapbook for me to open the night before the nuptials. Inside, there were handwritten letters from my bridesmaids, my mom, and my 79-year-old grandmother.\n\nThe letters were sweet, romantic, and optimistic — well, almost all of them were. My grandmother's letter had an ominous tone.\n\n\"I wish you and Scott all the happiness in the world in your married life. I am sure you two are just right for each other. That's not to say it will all be plain sailing,\" she wrote.\n\n\"There may be bumps along the road,\" she added, \"but love has a way of forgiving a multitude of sins.\"\n\nIt was a huge contrast to the other letters in the scrapbook. While my bridesmaids reminisced about the past and shared excitement for my future, my grandma's words stopped me in my tracks.\n\nI remember laughing and shaking my head in disbelief. I then handed the letter to my mom, who was equally unimpressed.\n\nIt's not that I didn't appreciate the advice. But really, who wants to hear the words \"love\" and \"sins\" mentioned in the same sentence? Especially when it's in relation to your own husband.\n\nFor a brief moment, I contemplated what she meant by the word \"sins.\" Cheating? Lying? Or something else?\n\nMy gran has a fantastic relationship with my husband, so I couldn't imagine what sparked her cautionary words. Similarly, I had never spoken a bad word about Scott to my grandmother.\n\nOf course, like any couple, we'd had fights, but it was never anything relationship-threatening. And I had never spoken about it with my her.\n\nUltimately, I disregarded the note, just as you would ignore a speck of dirt on a white wedding dress. Even if nobody else notices it, you know it's there.\n\nThe wedding day was picture-perfect.\n\nI felt so fortunate that we got to celebrate with our loved ones, especially our grandmothers. Both Scott and I were the first grandchildren in our families to get married, so it felt extra special.\n\nFive months later, I found my grandma's letter while looking through the scrapbook. It looked different to me with fresh eyes. Now that some time had passed, I could look at it from a new perspective. I could read without taking it personally.\n\nI thought about my grandmother's life, and I realized that her words were never about my husband and me.\n\nMy gran married my late grandfather when they were just teenagers, and it's fair to say they had many bumps in their own love story. Let's just say, their relationship wasn't like the kind I grew up watching in romantic comedies and Disney films.\n\nHowever, they loved each other deeply. They were loyal, forgiving, and supported each other throughout their more than 50-year marriage.\n\nThinking about their relationship reminded me that falling in love is a feeling, but staying in love is a choice. It's an action. It's not something that just happens to a person.\n\nThe wedding is the beautiful part, but the marriage? That's where things have the potential to get messy.\n\nI've been married for less than a year, so I'm not pretending to know all the answers. But if I'm honest with myself, I can admit that my grandma's letter shook me because it didn't fit the aesthetic Instagram version of what I thought marriage was supposed to be.\n\nI know that my husband and I have a great deal of joy ahead of us. But we're also going to witness one another's pain, grief, disappointment, and growth. That's just a part of sharing your life with someone.\n\nIf I ever catch myself feeling unprepared, I know I can revisit my grandma's letter.",

    "fullText": "Lou Gerstner, the former CEO of IBM who led the company through one of the most consequential turnarounds in corporate history, died on Saturday at the age of 83, the company said.\n\nGerstner ran IBM from 1993 to 2002, arriving at a time when the company was under severe pressure, and its future was in doubt. IBM was losing money, the tech industry was shifting rapidly, and there was widespread expectation that the company would be broken up.\n\nInstead, Gerstner chose to keep IBM together. He pushed the company to organize around customer needs rather than internal divisions, helping reposition IBM as a provider of integrated technology and services for large enterprises. That decision became central to IBM's recovery and renewed relevance.\n\nGerstner also drove cultural change inside the company. He emphasized direct decision-making, accountability, and execution, while insisting that innovation mattered only if it translated into real value for clients. The approach marked a sharp break from IBM's inward-looking habits that had taken hold before his arrival, IBM said in its announcement of Gerstner's death.\n\nHis tenure included painful restructuring. IBM abandoned long-standing traditions, including its decades-long \"cradle to grave\" no-layoff policy, as it sought to stabilize its finances and compete more aggressively. Many credit those moves, along with Gerstner's strategic focus, with saving the company from collapse.\n\nBefore joining IBM, Gerstner built a high-profile career in corporate America. He was a partner at McKinsey & Company, later served as president of American Express, and was CEO of RJR Nabisco. After leaving IBM, he chaired the Carlyle Group and focused on philanthropy, particularly in education and biomedical research.\n\nA native of Long Island, New York, Gerstner earned a degree from Dartmouth College and an MBA from Harvard. IBM said it plans to hold a celebration of his legacy in the new year.",

    "title": "Sam Altman says OpenAI's latest job opening pays over half a million dollars a year and is 'stressful'",
    "description": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned on X that the job would be \"stressful\" and they'll need to \"jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.\"",
    "fullText": "OpenAI wants to pay someone over half a million dollars to mitigate the downsides of AI.\n\nIf that seems like a lot of money, consider those potential downsides: job loss, misinformation, abuse by malicious actors, environmental destruction, and the erosion of human agency, to name a few.\n\nCEO Sam Altman described the job as \"stressful\" in an X post on Saturday. \"You'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,\" Altman wrote.\n\nAltman said the \"head of preparedness\" position is \"a critical role at an important time.\"\n\n\"Models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges. The potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025; we are just now seeing models get so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities,\" he wrote.\n\nOpenAI's ChatGPT has helped popularize AI chatbots among consumers, many of whom use the technology to research topics, draft emails, plan trips, or perform other simple tasks.\n\nSome users also talk to the bots as an alternative to therapy, which has exacerbated mental health issues in some cases, encouraging delusions and other concerning behavior.\n\nOpenAI said in October it was working with mental health professionals to improve how ChatGPT interacts with users who exhibit concerning behavior, including psychosis or self-harm.\n\nOpenAI's core mission is to develop artificial intelligence in a way that benefits all of humanity. It made safety protocols a central part of its operations from the outset. As it began releasing products, however, and pressure to turn a profit grew, some former staffers have said the company began to prioritize profit over safety.\n\nJan Leiki, the former leader of the now-dissolved safety team at OpenAI, said in a May 2024 post on X announcing his resignation that the company had lost sight of its mission to ensure the technology is deployed safely.\n\n\"Building smarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor. OpenAI is shouldering an enormous responsibility on behalf of all of humanity,\" he wrote. \"But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\"\n\nLess than a week later, another staffer announced their resignation on X, also citing safety concerns. One former staffer, Daniel Kokotajlo, said in a May 2024 blog post that he resigned because he was \"losing confidence that it would behave responsibly around the time of AGI.\"\n\nKokotajlo later told Fortune that OpenAI initially had about 30 people researching safety issues related to AGI, a still theoretical version of AI that reasons as well as humans, but a series of departures reduced that head count by almost half.\n\nThe company's former head of preparedness, Aleksander Madry, assumed a new role in July 2024. The position is part of OpenAI's Safety Systems team, which develops safeguards, frameworks, and evaluations for the company's models. The job pays $555,000 a year plus equity.\n\n\"You will be the directly responsible leader for building and coordinating capability evaluations, threat models, and mitigations that form a coherent, rigorous, and operationally scalable safety pipeline,\" the job listing says.",

    "title": "These work besties ditched their corporate jobs and poured their savings into an athleisure brand",
    "description": "Tiffany Chng and Olivia Yiong were work besties. Both were laid off, so during the pandemic, they ditched corporate and launched an athleisure brand.",
    "fullText": "Tiffany Chng and Olivia Yiong said they went from being work besties to regular besties and then work besties again.\n\nThe duo, both 31, met in 2018 and became inseparable while working at GuavaPass, a fitness app. Yiong was laid off when Guavapass was acquired by ClassPass in 2019.\n\nTwo years later, during the pandemic, Chng was laid off from her marketing job. The duo reunited to launch an athleisure brand, then called Butter, despite having no experience in fashion or entrepreneurship.\n\nChng's retrenchment and the pandemic lockdown gave them the push they needed to start the brand.\n\n\"At that point, we had nothing to lose,\" Yiong said.\n\nThey started with online sales, and in October this year, they opened their first retail store in Singapore's upscale ION Orchard mall, in the heart of the city's luxury shopping district.\n\nBuilding a brand during the pandemic in an already saturated market and for a conservative audience was not easy.\n\nExercise and sports have always been a big part of the founders' lives.\n\nYiong was an F45 trainer, has practiced yoga, pilates, and Muay Thai, and is now training for her first Hyrox. Chng was part of a national team representing Singapore at the 2011 Touch Rugby World Cup and has also dabbled in cheerleading, pilates, yoga, and HIIT.\n\nWhen Chng was laid off from ClassPass in 2020, they decided to go all in on an athleisure clothing line, which started off with the name \"Butter.\" They invested 20,000 Singapore dollars in 2020 into the brand.\n\nHalf came from Yiong's savings, and the other half came from Chng's severance pay.\n\nThey started product design in March 2020 and found suppliers in China. They launched in October that year with just two products in two colors: a longline sports bra and a pair of leggings.\n\nCOVID lockdowns that pushed everyone online helped them gain visibility. About 500 people joined an online workout they hosted in March 2021.\n\nIn 2022, they sold the brand to Love, Bonito, a Singaporean women's wear brand. Afterward, they changed the brand's name to Cheak.\n\nLaunching an athleisure brand in Singapore came with a unique set of challenges.\n\nWomen in Singapore and Southeast Asia place a high value on modesty and require padding in the bust, the duo said.\n\n\"A lot of overseas brands don't have padding. In Singapore, you need padding; it's non-negotiable. One of the most commonly asked questions we get is, 'Does it have padding?'\" Chng said.\n\n\"But padding changes the construction completely for the product — it requires so many more stitches, and it makes it difficult to have a very clean bind,\" she added.\n\nAnother issue was the sheerness of the fabric.\n\n\"Overseas brands don't double line their lighter colors because I think the women are a bit more comfortable with a slight sheerness, but in Singapore, that's not acceptable,\" she said.\n\n\"But when you double-line a garment, it becomes very thick. So, we spent about a year changing the fabric and reducing its thickness so that when we double-lined it, it would still be comfortable,\" Chng added.\n\nDesigning clothes for a customer base that likes to play it safe requires a good deal of restraint, the founders said. They said there was plenty they wanted to experiment with, but had to tone down.\n\n\"A lot of brands that are quite popular internationally are quite sexy and crazy nowadays,\" Yiong said. \"So we take that idea, and tweak it to what will work for our audience.\"\n\nSingapore is becoming a competitive space for athleisure brands. Alo Yoga, the athleisure brand worn by Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber, opened its first store in the city's Marina Bay Sands mall in September.\n\nIn ION Orchard, the mall where Cheak is located, shoppers can also find Lululemon, Cotton On Body, and Adidas.\n\nTo stand out, Cheak focuses on making clothes for Asian women — and that doesn't just mean making them more petite.\n\n\"The bust shape is different, our waists are smaller, our hips are slightly wider, and the femur is also a little bit shorter,\" Yiong said.\n\nSizing is different for Asian women, too, she added.\n\n\"We don't necessarily grow taller as we get bigger; we grow width-wise,\" Yiong said.\n\nShe also said that international brands do not suitably cater to the hot and humid climate that Southeast Asia is known for.\n\n\"Fresh international brands, let's say Alo, for example, they come in bringing winter season clothes,\" she said. \"There's no winter; we only have one season, so the fabric needs to be cooling.\"\n\nCheak's prices are slightly lower than those of its foreign competitors. One of Cheak's bestselling sports bras costs 55 Singapore dollars, or about $42, while a similar-looking piece from Lululemon costs S$58.\n\nThe business has yet to come between the founders.\n\n\"Outside of work, we don't talk about work,\" Chng said. \"We see each other on weekends, and our partners hang out together, but we never talk about work.\"\n\nOn the flipside, at work, they don't talk about other things, helping to distinguish their \"work personality and friend personality.\"\n\nYiong handles the backend work, while Chng handles the creative and customer-facing parts of the work.\n\nBut work and life inevitably collide, like when they go on holiday together and fire up their laptops to solve a crisis.\n\n\"Our partners see that as their cue to go do their own thing,\" Yiong joked.\n\nRunning their business comes with many perks. Chng, who just had a baby, said she loves having a flexible schedule and working in a hybrid setting.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it's less stressful than a corporate job.\n\n\"I think a lot of people glamorize what being a founder or starting your own business is,\" she said. \"You have to be able to give up everything, your time, your money, your brain power, your emotions into the business because if you don't do it, no one else is going to.\"\n\nShe added, \"It takes a different kind of resilience to handle it, but at the same time, I wouldn't trade it for anything.\"",

    "title": "I'm a professional chocolatier. When cocoa prices spiked, I found ways to make better chocolate — not smaller bars.",
    "description": "When cocoa prices doubled, chocolatier Jerome Peñafort of Mr. Bucket Chocolaterie refused shrinkflation by finding new ways to innovate.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jerome Peñafort, 38, the founder of Mr. Bucket Chocolaterie in Singapore. The following has been edited for length and clarity\n\nOnce prices go up, they rarely come back down — and that's definitely true for cocoa.\n\nFor a small business where the main material is cocoa, it's a real issue when your core ingredient keeps getting more expensive.\n\nWe work directly with farmers across Southeast Asia, so even before prices started climbing around mid-2023, we were already paying about two to three times the market rate — and now we're paying even more.\n\nWe're still paying the same higher price to our farmers, even though cocoa prices on financial exchanges have softened in recent months, because yields have dropped due to global warming and disease.\n\nThe higher cocoa prices have cut into profit margins. We're not profitable every month or year.\n\nThat has forced us to think differently about how we work: how we innovate, how we become more efficient, and how we stay true to our purpose.\n\nBefore founding Mr. Bucket, I worked in private equity and real estate, where I learned most of my business concepts.\n\nAbout eight years ago, my dad got involved in my uncle's chocolate manufacturing company. I joined the team around 2019 and began learning about chocolate and the entire supply chain.\n\nDuring that time, I had a conversation with a buyer from China that really sparked the idea of Mr. Bucket. We were selling entry-level supermarket chocolate when he told me that even if our chocolate was similar in quality to European brands, it would always be priced lower — simply because it wasn't made in Europe.\n\nThat really made me think: Why is Asian chocolate seen as inferior to European chocolate? Cocoa grows near the equator — in Asia, Africa, Central and South America — but not in Europe. It's just processed there.\n\nIn 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we launched Mr Bucket as an independent company and started making chocolate in Singapore when operations in Malaysia were disrupted. That's when I realized that chocolate made from Asian beans is delicious.\n\nOur first collaboration was with local snack brand The Golden Duck, when we infused their salted-egg flavor into our bonbons — a chocolate shell with layered fillings.\n\nA post shared by Mr. Bucket Chocolaterie (@mrbucketchocolaterie)\n\nDays after we launched the campaign, Singapore announced a lockdown, and because everyone was stuck at home, the response was amazing. We sold out hundreds of boxes of bonbons in two weeks.\n\nIn late 2020, Mr. Bucket launched a retail outlet in a local residential neighborhood, and in 2022, we opened a café at Dempsey Hill, a lifestyle destination in Singapore.\n\nWe can't plan our business around the hope that cocoa prices will come down. If they do, it's a bonus.\n\nHigh cocoa prices have forced us to be more productive and innovative in every part of the business.\n\nThe biggest change was in the product itself.\n\nWe started using the whole cacao fruit — not just the nibs that are usually ground with cocoa butter and sugar to make chocolate. We also use the husk and the pulp, which have a lot of flavor — but which are usually discarded — in our café offerings.\n\nWe drew inspiration from coffee and tea, using cacao to make beverages, broth, and even gelato. That helped us diversify and reduce waste.\n\nBecause of these changes, our overall cost of goods has gone down by about 15% to 20% compared with last year, even though raw cocoa prices are higher.\n\nInstead of using a lot of labor to do things by hand, we started automating certain parts. We bought new machinery and increased batch sizes.\n\nThrough it all, we've never changed our recipes, and we won't. We will not compromise on quality.\n\nWe're not reducing sizes either. In fact, some of our products are bigger now, like chocolates with caramel or kaya — a local coconut jam — centers.\n\nWe did a price increase last year. But as we became more efficient, we were able to bring some prices back down a little.\n\nIn this economy, consumers are definitely more conscious of their spending, but we've still seen growth.\n\nTo achieve that, we've had to work a lot harder: put out more products, do more collaborations, and create new products constantly.\n\nFor Christmas, we've launched a festive collection with new flavors like butterscotch and fruitcake.\n\nOur first-year revenue was less than $1 million Singapore dollars. We expect over SG$5 million, or $3.9 million, this year.\n\nWe're not just making chocolate.\n\nWe want to change the perception of Asian chocolate to show that it can be as good as any in the world.\n\nThat's what keeps us going: not cutting corners, but finding new ways to make better chocolate and to build a future for Asian cocoa.\n\nDo you run a small business in Asia affected by rising prices?

Chelsea have launched an investigation but have not commented officially at this stage.\n\nIt is also unclear whether referee Stuart Attwell and his officials saw the incident or whether it will be included in his report.

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nSenne Lammens (Manchester United): I was going to put David Raya in but I thought one good save doesn't get you in the Team of the Week - the bar is higher than that. He made four or five good saves against Newcastle, conducted his box well and has given Manchester United a platform and base to build off - which they've never had. All that for £18m, not bad at all.\n\nDeclan Rice (Arsenal): I obviously worked the game between Arsenal and Brighton at the weekend and Declan Rice filled in at right-back. He was still massively influential, marauding forward and defensively he was solid. He never had anyone at Brighton get at him. He just handled every situation well.\n\nArchie Gray (Tottenham): This one is a little bit dodgy, but I'm putting him in the team anyway. I'm aware he played in midfield against Crystal Palace but the reason I'm putting him there is because I felt like he needed to get in the team. Simply put: he got the winner and he's done every single thing that Spurs have asked of him - played left-back, played right-back, played right wing. You name it, he's done it all. I think he goes in for that situation\n\nKevin Danso (Tottenham): He was going to Wolves at one point but Spurs swooped in and signed him. I think he was meant to be a squad player but every time he steps in, he's fantastic. He doesn't do anything wrong. He just delivers on what he's supposed to do.\n\nLisandro Martinez (Manchester United): He's only 5ft7, 5ft8 and he had Nick Woltemade in his back pocket all day. It was really good to see him back playing after his massive injury. Him being back fit is monumental, not only for him but his World Cup aspirations as well.\n\nRyan Gravenberch (Liverpool): His influence is very simple: if he plays well, Liverpool play well. Obviously he got a goal against a Wolves team that they had to break down, nice finish. You don't really get that much credit for scoring against Wolves if I'm being totally honest, but he was very instrumental.\n\nTijjani Reijnders (Manchester City): Probably his best game since the first game of the season against Wolves. Not only the goal but his impact on the game. He's starting to show what he did at AC Milan. I really like him as a player.\n\nFlorian Wirtz (Liverpool): Again, he scored against Wolves - who will probably go down as the worst team in Premier League history - but he's growing into it and starting to fill into the shirt. Maybe the absences of Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak have made players start to play through him - and he's starting to be the player we all believed he could be.\n\nRayan Cherki (Manchester City): For me, he's the best player in world football to watch at the moment. He tries things and he's confident on the ball. Even when he makes mistakes, he doesn't care and tries again. He finished the weekend with a goal and an assist. He's the most exciting footballer to watch at this moment in time, and I say that over Lamine Yamal and everyone else.\n\nKevin Schade (Brentford): If you score a hat-trick, you end up in the Team of the Week. It's as simple as that. I nearly put Keith Andrews as the manager of the week.\n\nOllie Watkins (Aston Villa): We don't normally put players in who start on the bench. However, we've broken our rules. He had such an impact in the second half against Chelsea that he has to go in.\n\nUnai Emery (Aston Villa): Unbelievable result. Eleven wins on the bounce. I thought he not only got it spot-on tactically in the second-half, but his in-game managing and the changes he made - most notably when he brought on Ollie Watkins - showed the level he is currently operating at.\n\nHe outcoached Enzo Maresca, who everyone says is a top coach. I think he just showed the level of where he is truly at as a coach and what he can offer.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "Former champion Luke Humphries survived a scare to progress to the fourth round of the PDC World Championship as four previous winners won on Sunday.\n\nHumphries, who beat Luke Littler to win the 2024 title, saw off Germany's Gabriel Clemens 4-2.\n\nThe 30-year-old raced into a 3-0 lead but was pegged back to 3-2 and Clemens missed darts to level before Humphries set up a fourth-round tie against Nathan Aspinall or Kevin Doets.\n\nThree-time winner Michael van Gerwen also progressed with a 4-1 win over German debutant Arno Merk.\n\nHe led 2-0 before being pegged back but found another gear to set up a last-16 tie with two-time winner Gary Anderson.\n\nAnderson won a final-set thriller against Jermaine Wattimena in the afternoon to progress alongside 2018 winner Rob Cross.\n\nCross brushed aside Australian 16th seed Damon Heta in a comfortable 4-0 win and will face defending champion Luke Littler in the next round.\n\nThe Netherlands' 10th seed Gian van Veen also progressed after seeing off Latvia's Madars Razma with a 4-1 victory, while 20th seed Ryan Searle reached the fourth round for the first time since 2021 with a 4-0 demolition of Germany's Martin Schindler.",
