    "fullText": "Over the past 18 months, Charlie Cresswell (23) has excelled in France. The England youth international joined Toulouse FC from formative club Leeds United back in the summer of 2024 in search of game time.\n\nNot only has he been a regular for Le TéFéCé, he has also become one of Ligue 1’s best centre-backs in that time. This season, just like the last, he has been an ever-present for Carles Martínez Novell’s side, playing 16 league games and scoring three goals in that time.\n\nCresswell is now being linked with a move back to his native England. He was the subject of an approach from West Ham United late in the summer transfer window, and the Hammers have retained that interest, ahead of the opening of the January window, according to a report from The Athletic.\n\nHowever, prising him away from Toulouse won’t be easy, with the French club valuing the defender at €25m.",

    "fullText": "Former Liverpool striker Ian Rush believes the club has moved on from Mohamed Salah's explosive interview after their 3-3 draw with Leeds United, adding that the noise around the forward's comments three weeks ago \"is over now\".\n\nRush, who scored 346 goals across two spells at Anfield, is Liverpool's all-time top goalscorer, ahead of Roger Hunt on 285 goals and Salah on 250, told BBC Sport: \"The best thing I've heard since was Curtis Jones saying Mo [Salah] had apologised. It is over now.\n\n\"We need Salah if we are going to be successful in terms of winning games and trophies.\n\n\"It is good to see him scoring goals for Egypt, but now we want to have him back scoring for Liverpool.\"\n\nRush, who was taken to the Countess of Chester Hospital on 11 December and spent 48 hours in intensive care, also had plenty of praise for summer signing Hugo Ekitike.\n\nThe 23-year-old is the Reds' top scorer in the Premier League this season, having found the back of the net eight times in the first 18 games.\n\n\"He has been the standout,\" added Rush. \"He is a fantastic player who is quick and can play in different positions.\n\n\"Hugo Ekitike is the star so far. We need to keep him fit.\"\n\nThe 64-year-old also sympathised with summer signing Alexander Isak, who broke his leg in the 2-1 win over Tottenham, adding that the striker \"has everything about him\".\n\n\"His situation reminds me a bit of when I came back from Juventus to Liverpool,\" Rush said. \"I missed a bit of pre-season and was playing catch up. I was in and out of the side and I was getting these stupid injuries. That's what happens when you aren't fully fit.\n\n\"The ability is there with Alexander Isak, but he is getting these injuries which he maybe wouldn't have if he had done a full pre-season.\"\n\nRush has not been to Anfield since his health scare earlier this month, but the club ambassador hopes to be back at the stadium early in 2026.",

    "description": "D'Anton Lynn is leaving USC after two seasons to become the defensive coordinator at Penn State under new coach Matt Campbell.",
    "fullText": "Last January, D’Anton Lynn was given the chance to trade in his defensive coordinator job with the Trojans to lead the defense at his alma mater, Penn State. But Lynn turned Penn State down, and USC, in turn, gave its rising star coach a significant raise.\n\nNow, with the same offer on the table less than a year later, Lynn has decided to change course.\n\nLynn is leaving USC after two seasons to become the defensive coordinator at Penn State under new coach Matt Campbell, a person familiar with the decision but not authorized to speak on the matter told The Times.\n\nWhat changed in the 11 months between those two offers, outside of new leadership at Penn State, remains unclear. The Nittany Lions entered last season as presumed national title contenders before bottoming out in the first half of the season under James Franklin, who was fired in October. Campbell was hired earlier this month, but has no known ties to Lynn.\n\nAt USC, Lynn engineered an impressive turnaround of a Trojan defense that completely unraveled under previous coordinator Alex Grinch. USC gave up 10 fewer points per game under Lynn last season, leaping from 121st in the nation (34.4 points per game) to a respectable 56th (24.1). The defense improved considerably against the run, giving up nearly 50 fewer yards per game, and with its tackling, missing three fewer on average per game.\n\nBut the progress was less apparent in his second season as coordinator. USC allowed fewer points per game during the 2025 regular season, but struggled especially to stop the run and prevent big plays. Those issues proved particularly glaring in USC’s road losses to Illinois, Notre Dame and Oregon.\n\nStill, when UCLA’s head coaching job came open in September, Lynn, who previously led the Bruins defense, was seen as a potential candidate for the job. After turning down the Nittany Lions in January, many viewed Lynn’s next logical step being the NFL, where he spent his entire coaching tenure prior to joining UCLA.\n\nHis departure leaves USC to look for its third defensive coordinator in four years.\n\n In your inbox every Monday morning.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "Week 18 is upon us, which means Black Sunday and Monday are, too. Here are the names to know on the coaching hot seat as the NFL regular season draws to a close.",
    "fullText": "We’ve made it to Week 18 in the NFL season, which means we’re only days away from Black Sunday and Monday, the colloquial term for all the head coach firings that inevitably take place once the season ends.\n\nTwo head coaches, the Tennessee Titans’ Brian Callahan and the New York Giants’ Brian Daboll, have already lost their jobs. How many more will join them?\n\nWe’re taking the temperature of the coaches on or approaching the hot seat all week./\n\nRecord with team: 2-14, first season\n\nWhy he might get fired: Carroll was supposed to bring stability to the franchise, but it’s been more losing under the 74-year-old former Super Bowl winner. The Raiders haven’t won since Week 6, the offseason trade for Carroll’s preferred QB Geno Smith hasn’t yielded much, the offensive and special teams coordinators were both fired in November, and now there’s a dispute with Maxx Crosby over the star pass rusher being placed on injured reserve. None of this reflects well on Carroll, who may be in over his head trying to fix a franchise where the rot goes much deeper (and higher).\n\nWhy he might be safe: There was a reason Carroll was hired. He is almost 40 games over .500 for his NFL career, and that’s counting this season’s debacle. Also, Mark Davis has paid out a lot of money for failed coaches over the past few years and maybe he doesn’t want to shell out for Carroll too. Still, it’s hard to find a great reason to stick with Carroll, given hiss age and the Raiders’ need of an organization-wide reset.\n\nRecord with team: 45-58 (including playoffs), sixth season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Browns are headed for a fourth losing record in six years under Stefanski, as well as a second straight year picking in the top-five of the draft. The cataclysmic Deshaun Watson trade is partly on Stefanski, who recruited him in the spring of 2022, and for all of Stefanski’s offensive acumen, none of the 13 (!) quarterbacks who’ve started under his watch has proven to be the long-term solution.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Stefanski has done quite a bit with limited talent, especially on offense, and team owner Jimmy Haslam might give him a chance to actually develop a highly drafted QB. Stefanski has also been to the playoffs twice and maintains a steady demeanor, win or lose. He has won NFL Coach of the Year twice, and it’s not like this would be an attractive opening for this cycle’s top candidates.\n\nRecord with team: 14-18, second season (this stint)\n\nWhy he might get fired: Morris hasn’t been flat-out bad, but the Falcons have regressed this season and the overall operation feels shaky under his watch. While he might end up a fall guy alongside general manager Terry Fontenot, who oversaw an all-in 2025 that included trading away the team’s first-round pick next spring, Morris also hasn’t made a strong case for himself.\n\nWhy he might be safe: As mentioned above, the Falcons’ current mess is more on Fontenot. That doesn’t mean Morris is blameless — the McVay tree magic that Atlanta doubtlessly sought by bringing him in along with offensive coordinator Zac Robinson hasn’t materialized — but it also means team owner Arthur Blank might give him another year.\n\nRecord with team: 15-35, third season\n\nWhy he might get fired: Gannon was hired in part to toughen up Arizona’s defense, and that hasn’t really happened. This year’s unit is 26th in EPA per play allowed, 27th in success rate allowed, and in general hasn’t taken a step forward despite 17 of Gannon’s 28 draft picks being on that side of the ball, including six of seven last spring. It’s hard to say the Cardinals are demonstrably better than they were when Gannon was hired.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Kyler Murray is the biggest question lingering over the franchise, and Gannon might be winning more with better QB play. Perhaps team owner Michael Bidwill gives him a chance to prove it. He did have the Cardinals on an upward trajectory through his first two seasons.\n\nRecord with team: 34-32 (including playoffs), fourth season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The story of the McDaniel era (thus far) is starting with a bang and petering out, both in the micro and macro. He made the playoffs his first two seasons (including a hallowed 70 burger against the Broncos), but lost six of the last seven in 2022 and four of his last six in 2023. Since then, his motion-heavy, speed-oriented offense has been less effective against the league as a whole, and off-field issues (including players reportedly running out defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who won a Super Bowl with the Eagles last season) suggest McDaniel doesn’t have much command of the locker room.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Tua Tagovailoa’s limitations and concussion concerns have limited the Dolphins, and if they don’t bring him back next season, the salary cap hit would be so big that team owner Stephen Ross might decide it’s worth keeping McDaniel around one more year to get out from under it.\n\nRecord with team: 3-13, first season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Jets have been largely non-competitive, and that’s not what anyone expected in Glenn’s first season. He earned respect as a Pro Bowl player and the Lions’ defensive coordinator the past few seasons, but the Jets’ defense has regressed, the quarterback play has been bad, and the Jets were big-time sellers at the trade deadline. Justin Fields was benched in November and defensive coordinator Steve Wilks was fired in December. There aren’t many more heads to roll here.\n\nWhy he might be safe: At the league meetings in October, team owner Woody Johnson was candid that the Jets’ problems were at QB, not with Glenn. That carries a lot of weight, and Johnson’s stance reportedly hasn’t changed. The Jets also have five first-round draft picks the next two drafts, and there’s ample opportunity for Glenn to reshape the franchise in his image.\n\nRecord with team: 193-123 (including playoffs), 18th season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Ravens have been surprisingly mediocre this season, and it can’t all be attributed to Lamar Jackson’s injuries. Their defense has yo-yo’d between outright bad and competent, and some of Harbaugh’s in-game decisions have drawn scrutiny. Harbaugh has failed to get back to the Super Bowl with a two-time MVP quarterback in Jackson, and there’s a general sense that a breath of fresh air at head coach might be good for the Ravens.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Harbaugh has had only two losing seasons, and the stability he brings the organization is valuable. If he’s not back, it won’t be because he became a bad coach overnight.\n\nRecord with team: 200-125-2 (including playoffs), 19th season\n\nWhy he might get fired: A few weeks ago, fans were chanting “Fire Tomlin” during a blowout loss to the Bills. Then the Steelers took control over the AFC North and all was forgotten. But a loss to the 4-12 Browns, when Pittsburgh had a shot to clinch the division, forced a winner-take-all game against the Ravens in Week 18. Would a loss in that game, and no playoff berth, restart the talk about the Steelers and Tomlin both needing fresh starts?\n\nWhy he might be safe: Tomlin is a very good coach and to the chagrin of many Steelers fans, has had unending support from ownership. The Steelers value continuity, so they wouldn’t make a rash decision on Tomlin’s future. And it seems even more unlikely they’d make a move if the Steelers win the AFC North in the season finale.\n\nRecord with team: 35-35, fourth season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Buccaneers went on a long losing streak, dropping seven of eight and losing control of a weak NFC South. The Bucs’ downturn came as they got healthier, which was confusing. There were some bad losses, and for a coach without a great career record, maybe there isn’t a reason to believe things will be decidedly better in 2026.\n\nWhy he might be safe: Bowles did lead the Buccaneers to three division titles in his first three seasons, albeit in a mediocre NFC South. And the Buccaneers are still alive to win the division this season, even though they’re 7-9. Teams usually don’t fire coaches after making the playoffs, even if it comes with a losing record.\n\nRecord with team: 57-64-1, seventh season\n\nWhy he might get fired: The Bengals have missed the playoffs three straight seasons in Joe Burrow’s prime. Some of that can be attributed to Burrow’s injuries, but the Bengals’ deficiencies in protecting Burrow have contributed to his injuries. And the team around Burrow, particularly the defense, hasn’t been very good in a few years. Burrow expressed earlier this season that he wasn’t having fun, and while he has not pinned that on Taylor, the Bengals need to figure out what changes need to be made to keep Burrow happy.\n\nWhy he might be safe: One run to the Super Bowl is doing a lot of the heavy lifting on Taylor’s résumé. That came back during the 2021 season. But that has carried the reputation of the Bengals being annual contenders in the AFC, if Burrow could just stay healthy. Also, this is the Bengals, and they’re not going to want to pay someone who isn’t coaching for them anymore.\n\nWhy he might not get the job: It’s hard to point to the Giants’ record after Kafka replaced Brian Daboll and get excited. He has fired defensive coordinator Shane Bowen and assistant defensive line coach Bryan Cox since taking over, which is the type of chaos that doesn’t look great on an interim coach either.\n\nWhy he might get the job: Kafka has been mentioned as a future head coaching candidate in previous years, for his work as an offensive coordinator. And while the team’s record hasn’t been good, there have been close losses to good teams in that stretch.\n\nWhy he might not get the job: It was a forced arrangement after the team realized Brian Callahan needed to be fired. McCoy at least had some head-coaching experience. Hiring an interim who has put together a 2-8 record wouldn’t go over well with the fanbase.\n\nWhy he might get the job: Give McCoy this much: The Titans have played better late in the season, even if it hasn’t resulted in many wins. But it would be stunning if the Titans settled on McCoy after another miserable season.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays could be setting themselves up for a difficult roster decision in the outfield, especially if they decide to make a serious push for Kyle Tucker.\n\nOn paper, the fit makes sense. Tucker would immediately upgrade the lineup and give Toronto another middle-of-the-order bat. However, it complicates things for others.\n\nThe Blue Jays already have several players who seem to be penciled in, but could that change?\n\nGeorge Springer is taking up the majority of the at-bats at designated hitter, and Daulton Varsho isn’t moving out of the lineup. That leaves the corner outfield spots, where things could get crowded quickly. If Tucker is added, he’s playing every day – we already know that – which could hurt someone.\n\nAnthony Santander is probably the player who would be left behind. He’s been great in his career, but roster construction matters, and he struggled, while dealing with injuries, last season.\n\nThat’s a point Brandon Glick of FanSided noted when discussing how Tucker would impact Toronto’s roster.\n\n“This conversation will really become timely if the Blue Jays sign Kyle Tucker, who would immediately displace [Anthony] Santander in right field,” Glick wrote. “With George Springer taking up all of the at-bats at DH and Daulton Varsho locked into the starting spot in center field, Tucker’s presence would effectively mean that there’s one open spot for all of the aforementioned players.”\n\nIf the Blue Jays are willing to live with moving Santander, it would signal just how aggressive they’re trying to be.\n\nSantander still has four years remaining on his deal. He’s only making $11.8 million in 2026 and $11.4 million in 2027. He then has a player option in 2028 worth $9.4 million.\n\nI’d assume a team would want him, but who knows?\n\nInsider reveals Blue Jays plan for Bo Bichette if he re-signs in Toronto\n\nBlue Jays’ Chris Bassitt could still land back in Toronto, according to MLB insider\n\nBlue Jays, Red Sox among teams that have called Diamondbacks for Ketel Marte\n\nRed Sox reportedly in the mix for Blue Jays’ Bo Bichette, which might be telling about Alex Bregman’s future\n\nBlue Jays are favorites for Kyle Tucker, but Yankees, Mets, and Dodgers reportedly in the mix\n\nBlue Jays linked to Alex Bregman to replace Bo Bichette, despite Red Sox being favorites to sign star",

He’s 26 years old, has elite stuff, and is under team control until 2029.\n\nHowever, that’s why prying him from the Cincinnati Reds wouldn’t be cheap.\n\nCincinnati has no reason to move Greene unless the return is incredible. He isn’t a rental, and he isn’t anything short of a star.

The Yankees' upper-level pitching is as good as any in baseball.\n\n“Given his age (26), ability, and contract terms, it’s difficult to find a good comp for the type of package it would take to pry him from Cincy.

It’s not a stretch to imagine the Reds demanding George Lombard Jr. and Elmer Rodríguez in addition to several of the impressive crop of upper level pitching prospects,” Peter Brody wrote.\n\nPerhaps the Yankees will want to add a bat with those prospects instead of a pitcher, but having another arm like Greene is never a bad idea.\n\nYankees should add former NJ HS standout, Tigers big leaguer with near .900 OPS vs. left-handed pitching\n\nYankees linked to free agent Blue Jays All-Star as huge Anthony Volpe upgrade\n\nHow Yankees' Cody Bellinger decision could lead to big trade rumors\n\nYankees 'Plan B' if Kyle Tucker, Cody Bellinger sign elsewhere revealed\n\nESPN trade rumor has Yankees acquiring two veteran stars from Twins\n\nYankees urged to swap Jasson Dominguez to Marlins for 6'5'' ace",

Most expected that the Celtics' 2025-26 season would be flushed down the drain too, as Boston awaited their All-NBA forward to return.\n\nBut after 31 games this season, the Celtics are third in the Eastern Conference with a 19-12 record.

Not only is he a lock to make his fifth All-Star team, but Jeff Teague suspects that the quality of Brown's performances will earn him his first All-NBA nod at the end of the season.\n\nOn the Club 520 podcast, Teague argued that Brown has a better first-team All-NBA case than Luka Doncic, the NBA's leading scorer at 33.7 points per game. The former All-Star argued that Doncic is playing on a superior roster with the Los Angeles Lakers relative to who has been surrounding Brown in Boston.\n\n\"They have nothing over there (in Boston),\" Teague said. \"The Celtics were supposed to be a--, bro.

    "description": "The latest 2026 NBA Championship odds and analysis, with the Oklahoma City Thunder (+135) drawing the shortest odds to win it all.",
    "fullText": "It's amazing what a 27-5 start can do for the perception of a team.\n\nThe conversation around the Oklahoma City Thunder has shifted over the past few weeks from whether OKC is the best team in the NBA to whether they may just be the best team of all time.\n\nThere's no arguing the fact that the Thunder's 14.2 net rating is the best in modern history, and the defending champs have as much skill, depth, and defensive grit as any dynastic team in recent memory. It's no wonder then that their +135 odds to win the NBA Championship are far and away the shortest in the Association.\n\nLet's dive into the latest odds as the Thunder continue to separate themselves from the rest of the pack.\n\nHere's a visual representation of how the NBA championship has odds evolved since June 2025.\n\nHighest ticket percentage\n•    Nuggets 8.8%\n•    Thunder 8.7%\n•    Mavericks 8.2%\n\nHighest handle percentage\n•    Thunder 17.9%\n•    Mavericks 16.3%\n•    Lakers 13.3%\n\nBiggest liability\n•    Mavericks \n•    Lakers\n•    Warriors\n\nWe turned to the enormous computing power of ChatGPT to find out who the large language model believes will be the last team standing this season. Not surprisingly, it stuck with the defending champs.\n\nOklahoma City has the cleanest runway to be the best team in 2026: an MVP-caliber engine in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander entering the heart of his prime, a two-way star wing in Jalen Williams, and a 7-footer in Chet Holmgren whose blend of rim protection, spacing, and feel supercharges modern schemes. That trio already drives elite half-court efficiency and a top-tier defense, and it’s backed by organizational continuity that reliably turns role players into playoff-useful pieces. By 2026, Holmgren’s strength and timing should be fully NBA-hardened, unlocking more switching and fewer help-and-recover compromises, while SGA’s mid-range and foul-drawing remain matchup-proof in May and June.\n\nDepth and optionality push the Thunder over the top. They can win big or small, play five-out without sacrificing rim protection, and toggle between pressure defense and conservative coverages depending on opponent. Crucially, they still have surplus picks and cap flexibility to plug the inevitable holes that show up in a long postseason, whether that’s a second unit scorer, another stretch big, or a specialist wing.\n\nExpect a rotation stacked with plus length, shooting, and decision-making around the core; enough to outlast the West’s heavyweights and finish the job in the Finals.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "title": "It’s time for the Packers to make Rashan Gary a healthy scratch",
    "description": "It’s over for the former first round pick",
    "fullText": "The end of the road has arrived for Rashan Gary in Green Bay. However many games are left in the Green Bay Packers’ 2025 season is exactly the number of remaining games in which Rashan Gary will be a Green Bay Packer. If, and almost certainly, when, Gary is released after this season, the Packers will clear just shy of $11M in cap space for 2026, avoiding paying Gary the $18M he is due in base salary and an additional $1.5M in other bonuses. As has been covered by plenty of other folks at this website, doing this is a no-brainer for the Packers.\n\nNot only has it become clear that Gary is not worth star defensive end money; I also don’t think he’s even worth rostering on gameday.\n\nAs noted by our own Justis Mosqueda, Gary’s snaps have already been significantly reduced. Against Baltimore, Gary fell to third in the defensive end depth chart, being outsnapped by both Kingsley Enagbare and Lukas Van Ness. Gary only played on 45% of snaps, and didn’t register a single notable contribution other than getting pinned in by a sub-200 pound wide receiver.\n\nThat's a 198-pound wide receiver blocking Rashan Gary. pic.twitter.com/jGyMrqirvY\n\n— Michael Rodney (@PackersNotes) December 28, 2025\n\nFor the most part this season, Gary has graded out as a perfectly fine run defender, at least per PFF. His 72 run defense grade ranks in the top 20% of qualifying edge defenders. The primary problem for him has been his complete absence in the passing game since the first month of the season. Gary has not registered a single sack since week 8 against Pittsburgh. At that point in time, Tucker Kraft’s ACL was still intact.\n\n“But sir,” you say, “aren’t pressures more indicative of pass rushing performance than sacks?” And to that I say you fool, you silly silly fool, yes. But not all pressures are created equal, and Gary produces basically none of the good ones.\n\nThe Rashan Gary numbers are so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so bad pic.twitter.com/QY0ELVqCbJ\n\n— Justis Mosqueda (@JuMosq) December 28, 2025\n\nOn a per-snaps basis, Gary’s ability to get pressure quickly is mind-bogglingly bad. For reference, the league-average starting defensive end quick pressure rate is about 5.5%.\n\nParsons: 7.9%\nLVN: 2.8%\nGary: 1.6%\nEnagbare: 1.5%\n\n(all edge only, both Parsons and LVN do well inside too)\n\n— Justis Mosqueda (@JuMosq) December 28, 2025\n\nThere’s just no juice left in Gary’s game anymore. Not only is Gary unable to get pressure quick enough to impact a play, but even his run defense comes with major caveats. Remember that Gary hasn’t registered a single sack since the game against Pittsburgh? Rashan Gary has not registered a single tackle-for-loss since Pittsburgh. But sacks are of course counted as TFLs in the NFL. Rashan Gary does not have a single non-sack TFL this entire season. Sure, he can hold an edge alright in most situations, because he’s allegedly playing at about 280 pounds, but he’s not making any plays in any phase.\n\nWith very poor production in both the run and pass phases, Gary looks like a reserve defensive end, but he doesn’t do reserve defensive end things from a roster perspective. Not including field goal block, Gary has played 13 special teams snaps since the start of the 2021 season. All of those came on punt return, and I would bet pretty decent money they all came in punt-block scenarios. And you, dear reader, have seen Rashan Gary move. Do you really want him playing special teams snaps? And with Green Bay down so many tight ends to injury already, they really do need special teams snaps out of their defensive end body types.\n\nThe time has come when the Packers need to make actual gameday roster decisions. Do they really want to burn a gameday roster spot on a reserve defensive end who is perhaps the least effective pass rusher in the NFL and who also can’t play on special teams? There’s no reason to placate Gary, who is going to be off the roster in three months anyway. There’s no salvaging of trade value, as no one in their right mind is going to give up any compensation for a player due as much money as he is and with a production record this poor. The only reason to not healthy scratch him is that he still wears the captain “C” on his chest. Gary, by all accounts, is a good dude and well-liked in the locker room, but in a team that could regularly stand to be more cutthroat with its playing time and roster decisions, the time has come for him.",

    "description": "Will 2026 bring another deal?",
    "fullText": "As the calendar year changes to 2026, most teams in baseball still have an incomplete offseason. Over half of the major free agents are still unsigned, the Yankees have yet to add a single significant player, and many other teams have yet to make the big move that could put them over the top. While the Royals have done a good job improving at the margins by adding Isaac Collins, Lane Thomas, Nick Mears, and Matt Strahm, they have yet to make an impact move that can move the needle on their playoff chances.\n\nThey have been connected with a number of impact trade candidates, but teams have been unwilling to pull the trigger so far. Where do things stand with some players the Royals could be interested in, and how do recent moves impact those trade talks?\n\nThe Royals have been linked to Boston All-Star outfielder Jarren Duran all offseason. The 2024 All-Star saw his numbers dip a bit in 2025, but he remains an above-average bat with power and speed who can cover ground in centerfield, although his defense can be inconsistent at times.\n\nThe emergence of rookie Roman Anthony has given Boston a very crowded outfield with Gold Glove centerfielder Ceddanne Rafaela and Gold Glove rightfielder Wilyer Abreu. Masataka Yoshida will likely get most of the at-bats at DH, and Boston complicated the lineup even more by acquiring Willson Contreras to play first base, likely making Triston Casas expendable.\n\nKen Rosenthal wrote at The Athletic on December 15 about the trade talks between the two teams.\n\n“The Royals are under the impression Duran would cost them left-hander Cole Ragans, though the Red Sox view the initial talks as more informal and exploratory, according to people briefed on the conversations.”\n\nBoth Duran and Ragans have three more years of club control, through the 2028 season. Pitching is more of a premium than hitting, but Duran has been more valuable and durable than Ragans.\n\nBoston is looking for high-upside pitching to improve their rotation. They acquired pitcher Sonny Gray from the Cardinals to pair with ace Garrett Crochet, but he likely doesn’t have high upside at age 36. One executive says Boston has “quietly shopped” pitcher Brayan Bello, who Boston signed to a long-term deal in 2024.\n\nBoth teams have postured as if they don’t need to make a trade. At the Winter Meetings, J.J. Picollo told Anne Rogers “It would be really difficult for us to trade Cole,” adding, “We’re in a really good spot [with depth], so if the right trade comes along, and it costs us a starting pitcher, we have to look at it. It’s just not going to be Cole.” The Royals have been much more open to trading Kris Bubic, who has one more year before he hits free agency. But his limited club control and his injury last season makes him a much less attractive return.\n\nRed Sox head man Craig Breslow echoed similar reservations at the Winter Meetings, telling reporters that the team would have to listen to trade talks for their outfielders, but “the bar we’re going to hold is really high, because each of those guys is capable of contributing multiple wins to our team.” He insists the team can find a way to get playing time for four outfielders in three outfield spots.\n\nKiley McDaniel and Jeff Passan have predicted Duran has a 50 percent chance of being traded, writing that “the Red Sox are valuing Duran more like the seven-win player of 2024 than his 4-win version in 2025. Either way, his addition can instantaneously make a team better, and Boston can hold out for a big return because the Red Sox don’t have to deal him. At some point, though, the Red Sox will have to move Duran or Wilyer Abreu. Keeping full-time-quality players for less than full-time roles rarely works out well.“\n\nThe Royals and Red Sox seem to be engaged in a game of chicken at this point, with neither team willing to blink yet. The teams appear to be a good match for a trade – the Red Sox have the outfielders the Royals need, the Royals have the pitching the Red Sox need. But they seem to differ on the presumed value of their respective players. The Red Sox see Duran as an 8-9 WAR player like he was in 2024, while the Royals see him as a player who declined last year. The Royals see Cole Ragans as a potential ace, while the Red Sox see a pitcher coming off an injury-filled season who has twice had Tommy John surgery.\n\nThe Royals thought Jonathan India could be a high-on-base-hitter who could play second base and left field for them. He fell far short of that expectation, but the profile describes Brendan Donovan perfectly. A left-handed bat who can play both infield and outfield, Donovan is a very versatile hitter with a career .361 on-base percentage who was named an All-Star for the first time last year.\n\nThe 28-year-old has two more years of club control, but the Cardinals are undergoing a rebuild with new boss Chaim Bloom looking to make his stamp on the team. Derrick Goold at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports the Royals are one of a number of teams interested in Donovan, and that the Cardinals have shown interest in Royals rookie pitcher Noah Cameron. Katie Woo at The Athletic has written that the Giants and Mariners are the frontrunners to get Donovan, with the Cardinals asking about Mariners top pitching prospect Jurrangelo Cijntje and top 100 outfield prospect Lazaro Montes.\n\nThe Cardinals have already unloaded Gray and Contreras – both to the Red Sox, a team Bloom is very familiar with after serving as GM in Boston. Trading Donovan makes sense, but he’s only 28 and if Bloom sees a quick rebuild, conceivably Donovan could be a part of that. Top prospect JJ Wetherholt seems likely to take over second base soon, but Donovan could transition to the outfield, although that may require them to trade Lars Nootbaar instead.\n\nStill, a trade of Donovan seems most likely. Gleyber Torres opted to take a Qualifying Offer, and Jorge Polanco signed with the Mets, leaving Luis Rengifo and Willi Castro among the few free agent options at second base. Marcus Semien was traded to the Mets, while Brandon Lowe was sent to the Pirates, leaving a second base trade market that could include Padres infielder Jake Cronenworth and potentially Yankees infielder Jazz Chisholm Jr. For teams looking for a second baseman, Donovan appears to be the best option.\n\nComplicating matters a bit for the Royals was the decision to re-sign second baseman Jonathan India to an $8 million contract for 2026, a decision “that surprised many in the industry” according to Ken Rosenthal. He reported that the Royals see India as a comeback candidate that will only play second base next year. That doesn’t mean they wouldn’t pursue Donovan as an outfielder, but they seem less likely to acquire such a player after getting Isaac Collins, a versatile player who can get on base, in a trade from the Brewers.\n\nMarte is one of the more underrated players in baseball. Over the last three years the Diamondbacks seocnd baseman has been worth a combined 15.3 rWAR – 13th-most among all position players. He’s an All-Star who hits for average and power, plays solid defense, and can impact a lineup. He has a large, but fairly reasonable contract going forward that will pay him $102.5 million over the next six years.\n\nBut Marte is already 32 years old, and the last few years of that deal could look bad if he declines as most players do in their late 30s. Marte has also reportedly rubbed some teammates the wrong way for absences during the season. He does have a very limited no-trade clause that reportedly includes the Athletics, Cardinals, Giants, Pirates, and Yankees, although he can always waive the clause in the right circumstance.\n\nIn trade talks, Arizona’s asking price has been very high, with the Diamondbacks reportedly “asking for an established, well-regarded starting pitcher plus multiple other pieces in discussions.” This offseason they have signed free agent pitcher Mike Soroka and brought back pitcher Merrill Kelly, which may reduce their need for starting pitching.\n\nBoston has been said to be very interested, and may have expendable assets with infielder Kristian Campbell, first baseman Triston Casas, and pitchers Payton Tolle and Connelly Early as possible trade candidates. There is even the possibility Arizona could be interested in Duran. The Blue Jays, Rays, Mariners, Giants, Phillies, and Pirates have all been linked to Marte as well, although Pittsburgh seemed to address second base with the acquisition of Lowe.\n\nMarte seems like a less-likely option to be acquired by the Royals than Duran or Donovan. His contract is reasonable, but a small-market team like the Royals is unlikely to take on the financial risk of acquiring a player making that kind of money into his twilight years. Maybe there is the potential of some sort of three-team trade with Boston and Arizona involving Marte and Duran, but that requires a lot of moving parts that need to be resolved.",

    "fullText": "Tottenham Hotspur ‘currently have no interest’ in signing midfielder Leon Goretzka, according to The Athletic.\n\nRumours had swirled that Spurs were keen on a move for the Bayern Munich ace in January, but those reports have been rubbished.\n\nGoretzka has six months left on his deal and could have been a solid pick-up for Tottenham under the right terms.\n\nHowever, it appears Tottenham are not looking his way and rightly so. The 30-year-old is not the profile of player the North London giants should be looking at.\n\nThere is a reason the German international (67 caps) has fallen down the pecking order at Bayern when everyone is fit.\n\nBesides his ability to arrive late in the box, he does not offer other important qualities required in the engine room.\n\nGoretzka does not help control the game enough.\n\nHis vision is not special, and even though he works hard defensively, Tottenham can do better than the former Schalke 04 star.\n\nTottenham don’t just need a destroyer. Manager Thomas Frank deserves a true holding midfielder who can break up play and move the ball forward with purpose.\n\nUnfortunately, Spurs may not be able to land a world-class defensive midfielder until next summer.\n\nJoao Palhinha’s loan spell from Bayern Munich has addressed only half of that equation.\n\nHis ball-winning instincts and positional discipline have been useful, but his limitations in progression slow Spurs down and leave the build-up overly dependent on centre-backs.\n\nFor a side that wants to control games higher up the pitch, that simply isn’t sustainable.\n\nWhat Spurs need is a No.6 who can screen the defence, play through pressure, and connect phases.\n\nThe roster needs someone comfortable receiving on the half-turn and feeding runners between the lines.\n\nSlotting that profile alongside Rodrigo Bentancur would give Spurs balance, tempo, and control. Until then, their midfield will remain functional but incomplete.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIn Week 17 of the NFL season, the Cleveland Browns beat the Pittsburgh Steelers in a major upset that could have massive playoff ramifications.\n\nThe Steelers now pose the risk of losing to the Baltimore Ravens in Week 18, which would eliminate them from playoff contention. This loss was a brutal one for the Steelers, and it's largely in part to how they gameplanned around Myles Garrett.\n\nBrowns legend Joe Thomas took to Twitter/x to blast the Steelers for their gameplan against Garrett. He didn't hold back on the Steelers, as their fear of allowing Garrett to set the sack record led to a crushing loss.\n\n\"Sure seemed like the @steelers were happy to lose the game if it meant keeping @Flash_Garrett (Myles Garrett) from setting the NFL single-season sack record. SMH,\" Thomas posted after the game.\"\n\nThomas was very critical of the Steelers' game plan, which evidently was to run their offense with the major fear of allowing Garrett to break the NFL sack record against them in Week 17.\n\nWhile the Steelers haven't come out and outright said they planned to avoid Garrett at all costs, the way that the offense ran in Week 17 all but confirms that they were playing with immense fear of a Garrett sack.\n\nThis playstyle and game planning led the Steelers to lose this matchup, as a 10-6 loss was one they easily could've overcome if they weren't so scared of Garrett getting home.\n\nMore: Myles Garrett slams Steelers offensive gameplan after Browns upset win\n\nPittsburgh's offense was completely hindered by Garrett, and not necessarily because he was dominating the Steelers, but from the fear he caused the Steelers to have entering this week.\n\nIf the Steelers had already made the playoffs, this wouldn't be nearly as frowned upon. But, since the Steelers' loss now opens the door to the team missing the playoffs, with a Week 18 matchup against the Ravens, there's some real concern for Pittsburgh.\n\nThomas's critique is well deserved, as the Steelers might've ruined their playoff chances due to their fear of Garrett. It was a baffling decision, as now they've put all of their eggs into the Week 18 basket.\n\nThomas was far from the only one calling the Steelers out for this game plan, as many around the NFL questioned the Steelers in Week 17. Time will tell if it was worth it or not, but for now, the Steelers are getting blasted for their Week 17 game plan to avoid Garrett at all costs, to not allow him to break the sack record in Week 17.\n\nMyles Garrett sacks tracker: Updated 2025 total for Browns star amid chase for NFL single-season record\n\nBrowns' Shedeur Sanders is under pressure more than any QB since 2009\n\n‘I’ll be damned': Myles Garrett reacts to the idea of Browns tanking\n\nDenzel Ward shades Steelers after game-saving coverage\n\nMyles Garrett stats: Browns pass rusher held without a sack in upset over Steelers\n\nDeion Sanders' reaction to Shedeur's terrible interception tells the whole story",

    "fullText": "Yankees predicted to make trade for two-time All-Star, but not until this happens originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOnce the New York Yankees feel comfortable with how the lineup looks, the next move feels obvious. The rotation still needs help.\n\nNew York has enough arms to get through the regular season, but that’s not really the idea here. Injuries are already part of the conversation with Gerrit Cole and Carlos Rodon, and there isn’t much if they were to be hurt.\n\nSure, the Yankees' staff is decent, but it needs to stay healthy.\n\nSigning depth helps, but it doesn’t change that reality.\n\nIf the Yankees decide to be aggressive, it’s likely going to be via trade rather than another short-term signing. They’ve shown a willingness to deal from prospect depth when the fit makes sense, and I’d expect that to be the case again this winter.\n\nThat’s where Freddy Peralta comes into play. The Milwaukee Brewers right-hander is under control, elite, and capable of handling a significant workload.\n\nHe’s the type of starter who would change things for New York.\n\nAlexander Wilson of Empire Sports predicted the Yankees will pivot in that direction once the lineup is settled and sign Peralta.\n\n“Once the lineup is secured, I expect Cashman to aggressively pivot to the rotation by targeting Milwaukee Brewers ace Freddy Peralta. The Yankees and Brewers already have a well-oiled trade pipeline, established last winter when New York sent Nestor Cortes and Caleb Durbin to Milwaukee for Devin Williams.\n\n“While the recent move where the Yankees re-sign Paul Blackburn to a one-year, $2 million contract provides depth, it does not move the needle for a team trying to win a World Series. Peralta is the legitimate frontline hammer that helps protect a unit already dealing with major injury questions,” he wrote.\n\nIf the Yankees make a move, it’s hard to see it being for another depth arm. A pitcher like Peralta fits what they’d be trying to accomplish at this stage of the offseason.\n\nYankees’ Cody Bellinger predicted to ‘settle’ on $170 million deal amid quiet start to free agency\n\nYankees trade proposal involves George Lombard Jr. for front-line starter who throws 100-plus MPH\n\nYankees should add former NJ HS standout, Tigers big leaguer with near .900 OPS vs. left-handed pitching\n\nYankees linked to free agent Blue Jays All-Star as huge Anthony Volpe upgrade\n\nHow Yankees' Cody Bellinger decision could lead to big trade rumors\n\nYankees 'Plan B' if Kyle Tucker, Cody Bellinger sign elsewhere revealed",

    "fullText": "Plenty has changed at Tottenham this season – a new manager, new signings and the departure of long-serving chairman Daniel Levy.\n\nBut what has not changed is the results on the pitch.\n\nSpurs finished 17th last season under Ange Postecoglou and although they are in a better position as it stands in 11th under Thomas Frank, they are still a way off where they want to be.\n\nXavi Simons, Mohammed Kudus, Joao Palhinha and Randal Kolo Muani were brought in this summer, but what extra business do Spurs need to do in January to ensure they have a better second half of the campaign?\n\nTottenham have a problem on the left-hand side. Despite having a natural winger in Wilson Odobert in the squad, Frank reguarly opts for Kolo Muani or Richarlison to play wide on the left.\n\nBoth players are best in the number nine position and therefore Spurs’ attacks have tended to be very lop-sided towards the right.\n\nHaving a natural left winger out wide that Frank trusts would allow his side to become more unpredictable going forward, and would bolster a forward line that is lacking. Heung-Min Son might not have been the player he once was, but they certainly miss his goals.\n\nPerhaps the best option that Tottenham could go for in that position is Savinho from Manchester City. They initially made an offer for him in the summer that was rejected by City. However, Antoine Semenyo moving to City could open the door for Savinho to switch to Tottenham.\n\nPalhinha and Xavi were brought in this summer to add creativity and experience to Spurs’ midfield but both have failed to push Tottenham up a level.\n\nThe Portuguese international has not started any of the last five matches in the Premier League, while Xavi has only managed one goal in the league so far this season and has struggled to adapt to his new club.\n\nInjuries to James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski has left them very short on creativity in the middle of the park. If they want to work their way up the table then they need to address this issue.\n\nWith Ben Davies missing for most of this season through a hamstring injury and Destiny Udogie suffering both a knee and a hamstring injury this season, Spurs have lacked cover at left back.\n\nDjed Spence has filled in but he is primarily a right-back, therefore cover at left-back would allow for more rotation with Spurs still in the FA Cup and Champions League too.\n\nYves Bissouma is the most obvious player that Spurs could look to offload this winter. The midfielder is currently in Morocco competing in the Africa Cup of Nations for Mali, but he is yet to play for his club under Thomas Frank.\n\nRecently, Spurs have said that a case regarding the Mali international filming himself inhaling laughing gas is under review, and he was left out of the squad that lost to PSG in the Super Cup due to disciplinary reasons as well.\n\nHe was linked with a host of clubs in the summer, including Fenerbahce and Galatasaray, and does appear to have much of a future at the club.\n\nBrennan Johnson has been linked with a move to Crystal Palace, meanwhile. The Welshman was Spurs’ top scorer last season, but has only started six matches in the Premier League so far this campaign.\n\nIf Spurs do end up signing a winger, Johnson could be the player that makes way for the new incoming.",

    "fullText": "Orianna Rosa Royle is the Success associate editor at Fortune, overseeing careers, leadership, and company culture coverage. She was previously the senior reporter at Management Today, Britain's longest-running publication for CEOs.\n\nTrying to summarize every job you’ve ever had and then distill that onto a two-page résumé has been the bane of job hunter’s existence since around the 1950s. Fortunately, for Gen Z, it’s something they might never have to bore themselves with.\n\nThat’s because research shows many companies are moving away from relying on the traditional job application requirement.\n\nIn fact, almost three-quarters of companies now use skills-based assessments throughout their hiring process, according to TestGorilla’s The State of Skills-Based Hiring 2023 report which surveyed 3,000 employees and employers around the world. This is up from 56% in the previous year.\n\nAlthough many of those employers are still also using CVs, it might not be long until they’re a thing of the past because most bosses are already favoring the new hiring practice and reporting big results.\n\nThe employers surveyed who use skills-based hiring—which includes role-specific skills assessments, instead of simply scanning someone’s listed career experience—reported massive gains.\n\nAccording to TestGorilla’s research, it reduced the number of mis-hires by 88%, total time spent searching for the perfect candidate by 82%, and hiring-related costs by 74%.\n\nOverall, 92% of the employers surveyed reported that skills-based hiring is more effective at identifying talented candidates than a traditional CV. Meanwhile, over 80% said it’s more predictive of on-job success and leads to new hires staying longer in their roles.\n\nAs Khyati Sundaram, CEO of the skill-based recruitment platform Applied, previously told Fortune, just because someone has listed on their résumé that they’ve worked with the SEO team at somewhere alluring like Google, it doesn’t actually mean they know the ins and outs of search engine optimization to the extent that’s required for a role.\n\n“We are trying to make sure the test or the question is as relevant to the job as possible,” Sundaram said, adding, “That’s the reason that candidates love it too.”\n\nIntuitively people may assume that taking multiple skills-based tests would feel like more of a nuisance for job seekers than simply blasting their CV at hundreds of roles—but the data shows otherwise.\n\nMost of the workers that TestGorilla surveyed think that skills-based hiring levels the playing field and improves their chances of bagging their dream jobs.\n\nThis is especially true for candidates who are often overlooked. In fact, around three-quarters of the Black, Asian, and Arab employees that TestGorilla surveyed have already reportedly gained access to new employment opportunities through skills-based assessments.\n\nThe uptick in skills-based hiring comes as degrees have slidden down the priority list for employers.\n\nGoogle, Microsoft, IBM, and Apple previously eliminated their long-held degree requirements to remove barriers to entry and recruit more diverse talent. Meanwhile, recruiters globally are five times more likely to search for new hires by skills over higher education.\n\nA former Cisco top executive in the U.K. also said young aspiring workers would be better off skipping out on college to join the world of work straight away.\n\n“In university, you come out with whatever degree you may get, but it’s almost certainly saddled with debt,” David Meads, former Cisco’s U.K. and Ireland CEO, told Fortune. “Is that better than on-the-job experience where you’re rotating through different parts of our organization, and living the reality and not just the theory?”\n\n“For me, attitude and aptitude are more important than whatever letters you have after your name, or whatever qualifications you’ve got on a sheet,” he added.\n\nBut research has shown that skeptical Gen Z remain unconvinced: They’re shunning apprenticeship schemes in favor of going down the traditional route of college. So perhaps they will still go through the bore of writing a résumé—even if, like a college degree, it’s no longer needed.\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on November 23, 2023.",

    "fullText": "A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure that answers a very specific question - have I seen this thing before? - while using almost no memory.\n\nThere is a trade-off, though - bloom filters can be ‘wrong’. A Bloom filter will never tell you something is absent when it is actually present, but it might occasionally claim something exists when it does not.\n\nIn this essay, we explore Bloom filters end-to-end, from fundamental concepts to advanced variants like counting and deletable Bloom filters, the nuances of hash functions, and real-world benchmarks and use-cases.\n\nSay, you are building a recommendation engine for a content platform with millions of users. Each user has seen thousands of articles. When generating recommendations, you need to filter out articles the user has already seen.\n\nStoring every article ID for every user in a hash set would consume enormous amounts of memory. Let’s crunch the numbers…\n\nStoring article IDs directly in a hash set:\n\nThat is 800 GB of RAM just for tracking which articles users have seen. Even with a more optimistic 1.5x overhead factor, you are looking at 600 GB.\n\nBloom Filter will take up about ~60GB (one-tenth) of space by not storing actual article IDs, but rather storing the existence in a compact bit array that can answer the question:\n\nhas this user probably seen this article?\n\nIf the answer is no, you can confidently recommend it. If the answer is yes, you either skip it or do a more expensive lookup to confirm. In practice, this cuts memory usage by more than 90% without slowing down recommendation generation.\n\nVariations of this idea show up in many large systems - Medium uses it in recommendations, Chrome uses it to flag unsafe URLs, and databases rely on Bloom filters to avoid unnecessary disk reads.\n\nA Bloom filter consists of two components: a bit array of m bits, all initially set to zero, and a collection of k independent hash functions. Each hash function maps an arbitrary input to one of the m array positions.\n\nTo add an element to the filter:\n\nTo check if an element might exist in the filter:\n\nIf any bit at the computed positions is zero, the element was definitely never added. Those positions would have been set to one during insertion. However, if all bits are one, the element might have been added, or those positions might have been set by other elements. This is the source of false positives.\n\nConsider a concrete example. Suppose you have a 10 bit array and two hash functions. You insert the strings “apple” and “banana”:\n\nAfter these insertions, bits 2, 3, 5, and 7 are set to one. Now you check for “cherry”:\n\nBoth positions are already one (set by previous insertions), so the filter incorrectly reports that “cherry” might be present. This is a false positive.\n\nAfter inserting n elements using k hash functions into a filter with m bits, the probability that a specific bit remains zero is:\n\nIf you have m bits in your array and a hash function that outputs random positions, the probability of hitting any specific bit is 1/m. Hence, the probability of NOT hitting a specific bit with one hash is 1 - 1/m. The probability of that bit being zero with n insertions and each one setting k bits will be (1 - 1/m)^(kn).\n\nFor large m, this approximates to:\n\nThe probability of a false positive is the probability that all k bits are set for a random element not in the set:\n\nHere’s an interesting and important trade-off. Increasing m (more bits) reduces false positives but uses more memory. Increasing k (more hash functions) can either help or hurt depending on the relationship between k and m/n.\n\nThe optimal number of hash functions that minimizes the false positive rate is (via simple differentiation):\n\nAt this optimal k, the false positive rate becomes:\n\nWorking backwards, if you want a specific false positive rate p, you need approximately:\n\nFor a 1% false positive rate, you need about 9.6 bits per element. For 0.1%, you need about 14.4 bits per element.\n\nCompare this to storing 1 million 64-bit integers directly, which would require 8 MB. The Bloom filter achieves roughly 7x space savings while providing probabilistic membership testing.\n\nBloom filters require hash functions that are fast, produce uniformly distributed outputs, and behave independently of each other.\n\nCryptographic hash functions, such as SHA-1 or MD5, offer good distribution properties and security guarantees; however, they are computationally expensive. Since Bloom filters do not require cryptographic security, using them wastes CPU cycles.\n\nNon-cryptographic hash functions are the standard choice:\n\nA seminal paper by Kirsch and Mitzenmacher showed that you do not actually need k independent hash functions. Instead, you can compute just two hash functions and derive all k positions using a linear combination:\n\nThis is called double hashing or the Kirsch Mitzenmacher optimization and it reduces computational overhead dramatically while maintaining the same asymptotic false positive rate. Most production Bloom filter implementations use this approach.\n\nA subtle but important implementation detail: if h2 can be zero or share a common factor with m, you may get degenerate cases where multiple positions collide. The enhanced double hashing variant addresses this by ensuring h2 is always odd (when m is a power of two) or relatively prime to m:\n\nRocksDB discovered this issue in their Bloom filter implementation and fixed it by ensuring the delta value is always odd, which guarantees distinct positions when m is a power of two.\n\nStandard Bloom filters have a significant limitation: you cannot remove elements. Once a bit is set to one, there is no way to know if it was set by one element or multiple elements. Unsetting it could cause false negatives for other elements that share that bit position.\n\nSeveral variants address this limitation:\n\nThe most straightforward approach replaces each bit with a small counter (typically 4 bits). Instead of setting bits to one, you increment counters. To delete an element, you decrement the counters at the corresponding positions.\n\nThe trade off is significant: using 4 bit counters means the filter uses 4x more memory than a standard Bloom filter. Counter overflow is another concern. If too many elements hash to the same position, the counter saturates. Most implementations handle this by leaving saturated counters at maximum and never decrementing them, accepting a slight increase in false positives.\n\nThe Deletable Bloom filter takes a different approach. Instead of counting, it splits the entire bloom filter array into r logical regions, then tracks which bit regions have experienced collisions (in at least one of the bit), and maintains a separate collision bitmap.\n\nThe DlBF provides probabilistic deletability: most elements can be deleted, but some cannot. The advantage is a much lower memory overhead compared to counting filters.\n\nWhen evaluating Bloom filter implementations, several metrics matter and most of these benchmarks can be found on my GitHub Repository - abloom.\n\nMeasures how many elements per second can be added to the filter. This depends primarily on:\n\nA Bloom filter should achieve hundreds of thousands to millions of insertions per second. Redis benchmarks show around 250,000 insertions per second with pipelining.\n\nTypically similar to or faster than insertion, since lookups can short-circuit on the first zero bit. The double hashing optimization particularly benefits lookups by reducing hash computations.\n\nThe theoretical false positive rate assumes perfect hash functions. Real implementations could be benchmarked to verify.\n\nBloom filters are pretty common in modern databases, particularly those using Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees.\n\nDatabases like RocksDB, Cassandra, LevelDB, and HBase all use Bloom filters to optimize read paths. In an LSM tree:\n\nWithout Bloom filters, every key lookup might require reading multiple SSTables from disk. With Bloom filters attached to each SSTable, the database can quickly determine if a key is definitely not present, avoiding expensive disk reads.\n\nCassandra exposes this as a tunable parameter. The bloom_filter_fp_chance setting controls the false positive rate per SSTable:\n\nLower values (like 0.01) use more memory but reduce unnecessary disk reads. Higher values (like 0.1) save memory at the cost of more false positive disk accesses.\n\nChecking if content has been seen before is a classic Bloom filter application. Examples include:\n\nThe key insight is that false positives (occasionally re-checking something already processed) are acceptable, while false negatives (missing something new) are not.\n\nCDNs use Bloom filters to track which objects are cached at edge nodes. Akamai pioneered the technique of using Bloom filters to avoid caching “one hit wonders” (objects accessed only once). By only caching objects seen at least twice, they dramatically improved cache efficiency.\n\nImagine a table with 10 columns and queries that filter on various combinations:\n\nThe traditional approach is to create B-tree indexes. But which combinations do you index?\n\nThis explodes quickly. With 10 columns and arbitrary query patterns, you might need dozens of indexes, each consuming significant disk space and slowing down writes.\n\nPostgreSQL’s Bloom index creates a single compact index that encodes all specified columns into one Bloom filter per row (or per page).\n\nYou are joining a large table (1 billion rows, 500 GB) with a small table (100,000 rows, 10 MB):\n\nWithout optimization, Spark would broadcast the small table to all nodes:\n\nBut what if only 5% of rows in the large table actually have matching user_ids? You are still reading and processing 1 billion rows.\n\nBloom filters, invented by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970, remain one of the most widely deployed probabilistic data structures. It’s simplicity, efficiency, and well-understood mathematical properties put it to the core of modern systems design - from database internals to distributed systems to network security.\n\nWhen you need fast, space-efficient membership testing and can tolerate occasional false positives, Bloom filters are often the optimal choice.",

    "fullText": "Asia In Brief China’s Cyberspace Administration on Saturday posted draft rules governing the behaviour of AI companions that prohibit using them to serve as friends for the elderly.\n\nThe draft “Interim Measures for the Administration of Humanized Interactive Services Based on Artificial Intelligence” opens with a suggestion that China needs regulations to ensure the healthy development of AIs that “engage in emotional interaction with humans.”\n\nAs is always the case with China’s tech regulations, the draft calls for providers of companion AIs to ensure they are secure, don’t expose users to fraud, encrypt data, and reflect core socialist values. It also includes a requirement for parental controls, and for protection of data that describes minors.\n\nOne Article in the draft addresses how AI companions interact with the elderly:\n\nProviders shall guide elderly people to set up emergency contact persons for their services. If any elderly person is found to be in danger of losing their life, health or property during the use of the service, the provider shall promptly notify the emergency contact person and provide social and psychological assistance or emergency relief channels.\n\nProviders are prohibited from providing services that simulate the relatives or specific relationships of elderly users.\n\nThe draft also calls for AI companions to remind users they are not interacting with a human every two hours, and for providers of such systems to provide advance notice of outages.\n\nAlso among the draft requirements are calls for “mental health protection, emotional boundary guidance, and dependency risk warning, and should not use replacing social interaction, controlling users' psychology, or inducing addiction as design goals.”\n\nThe draft also prohibits using data gathered during interaction with AI companies to train models.\n\nThe Cyberspace Administration wants feedback on the draft by January 25th.\n\nAustralia’s Department of Defence has tapped Google for an “enhanced, secure and air-gapped hyperscale cloud capability.”\n\n“Defence will have access to advanced global cloud solutions to deliver key sovereign capabilities,” states the department’s announcement of the deal. “The technology will support faster rollout of critical systems, ongoing upgrades and improved cooperation with international partners, while ensuring Australia retains control of critical Defence assets.”\n\nAustralia’s government already has a deal with AWS to operate three datacenters dedicated to government workloads, including information rated as the nation’s “most classified data.”\n\nThe Department said the sensitivities of the Google deal mean it will “refrain from providing further commentary … with all specific details remaining strictly confidential.”\n\nJapan’s Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has published its initial analysis of the failed launch of its H3 rocket last week.\n\nThe agency found that when the rocket’s fairing separated, pressure in a fuel tank fell. When the engine that used the fuel tank ignited, it produced around 80 percent of expected pressure.\n\nThe rocket’s second stage and payload therefore could not reach the intended orbit. The report suggests both fell into Earth’s atmosphere and burned up safely.\n\n57 percent of components present in Huawei smartphones are now made in China, according to a product teardown reported by Japanese outlet Nikkei.\n\nWorking with Japanese teardown service Fomalhaut Techno Solutions, Nikkei analyzed the content of 2024’s Mate 70 Pro and this year’s Pura 80 Pro, and found 57 percent of components in both were made in China, and that those parts accounted for 60 percent of the phone’s value.\n\nNikkei reports that just 19 percent of components in Huawei’s 2020 models came from China, rising to 32 percent in 2023.\n\nPapua New Guinea’s (PNG’s) National Information & Communications Technology Authority has warned signatories to a petition calling for Starlink to be licensed for operations in the country that they risk prosecution.\n\nPNG is a rugged country with poor telecommunications infrastructure – a fine fit for Starlink’s satellite broadband service. Local netizens have campaigned for PNG to license Starlink, suggesting they email NICTA to express support for Starlink.\n\nOn December 16th NICTA demanded Starlink suspend services to the country.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, NICTA published a list of petitioners and warned “Individuals who have signed or participated in the petition may be regarded as potential offenders, and NICTA will not hesitate to pursue appropriate regulatory and legal action where non-compliance is established.”\n\nStarlink has since ended service in PNG.",

    "fullText": "Apache Cassandra is a distributed database designed for high availability and horizontal scalability. This write-up explores the complete write path in Cassandra, from the moment a client sends a write request to how data gets replicated across nodes in the cluster.\n\nWhen a client writes data to Cassandra, the data flows through multiple stages before being safely stored. The write path involves several key components working together to ensure durability, consistency, and performance. Let’s break this down…\n\nEvery write request in Cassandra starts with a client connecting to any node in the cluster. The node that receives the client request becomes the coordinator for that operation. This is an important concept: there is no “master” node in Cassandra—any node can coordinate any request.\n\nThe coordinator doesn’t necessarily store the data itself, though it might be one of the replica nodes depending on the partition key and replication strategy.\n\nBefore the coordinator can forward writes, it needs to determine which nodes should store the data. This decision is based on three key factors.\n\nEvery piece of data in Cassandra has a partition key. This key is hashed using a partitioner (typically Murmur3Partitioner) to produce a token—a 64-bit integer that determines where the data lives in the cluster.\n\nFor example, if you have a table storing user data:\n\nWhen you insert a user with user_id = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000', Cassandra hashes this UUID to produce a token. This token falls within a range owned by specific nodes in the cluster.\n\nCassandra organizes nodes in a logical token ring. The entire token space (from -2^63 to 2^63-1 for Murmur3) is divided among the nodes in the cluster. Each node is assigned a token range and is responsible for storing data whose tokens fall within that range.\n\nWhen you add or remove nodes, the token ranges are redistributed, but only a fraction of the data needs to move—this is the beauty of consistent hashing.\n\nThe replication strategy determines how many copies of the data exist and where they’re placed. There are two main strategies:\n\nSimpleStrategy: Used for single data center deployments. It places replicas on consecutive nodes in the ring. For example, with a replication factor of 3, the data is stored on the first node determined by the token, plus the next two nodes clockwise in the ring.\n\nNetworkTopologyStrategy: Used for multi-data center deployments. It allows you to specify how many replicas should exist in each data center. For example:\n\nThis creates 3 replicas in datacenter1 and 2 in datacenter2. Within each data center, replicas are placed on different racks when possible to maximize availability.\n\nOnce the coordinator determines which nodes should receive the write, it forwards the mutation to those nodes. Now let’s see what happens inside each replica node when it receives a write request.\n\nThe very first thing that happens when a node receives a write is that it appends the mutation to the CommitLog. This is a critical step for durability.\n\nThe CommitLog is an append-only log file on disk. It’s structured as a sequential write, which is extremely fast—modern SSDs can handle hundreds of thousands of sequential writes per second. The CommitLog entry contains:\n\nCommitLog configuration considerations:\n\nThe commitlog_sync parameter has two modes:\n\nMost production systems use batch mode with a 2ms window, providing a good balance between durability and performance.\n\nImmediately after writing to the CommitLog, the mutation is written to an in-memory structure called a MemTable. Each table in Cassandra has its own MemTable.\n\nThe MemTable is essentially a sorted map structure (similar to a Red-Black tree or Skip List) that keeps data sorted by partition key and clustering columns. This sorting is crucial for efficient reads and for the later flush to disk.\n\nMultiple writes to the same partition key will update the MemTable in place. However, Cassandra doesn’t actually update data—it writes new timestamped versions. When you “update” a column, you’re really adding a new entry with a newer timestamp. The reconciliation happens at read time.\n\nExample of MemTable organization:\n\nOnce the write is in the CommitLog and MemTable, the node sends an acknowledgment back to the coordinator. This happens very quickly, typically in microseconds, because it only involves an append to the CommitLog and an in-memory update.\n\nAt this point, the write is considered successful from the replica node’s perspective, but the coordinator hasn’t responded to the client yet. That depends on the consistency level.\n\nThe MemTable is memory-bound, so it can’t grow indefinitely. When a MemTable reaches a certain size threshold or after a certain time period, it’s flushed to disk as an SSTable (Sorted String Table).\n\nSSTables are immutable once written. This immutability provides several benefits:\n\nHowever, immutability means we accumulate multiple SSTables over time, which is why compaction is necessary.\n\nThe consistency level determines how many replica nodes must acknowledge a write before the coordinator responds to the client. This is configurable per query and represents a fundamental trade-off between consistency, availability, and latency.\n\nThe coordinator waits for acknowledgment from just one replica node. This provides the lowest latency and highest availability - the write succeeds as long as any single replica node is reachable. However, you might read stale data if you subsequently read from a node that hasn’t received the write yet.\n\nThe coordinator waits for acknowledgments from a majority of replica nodes. For a replication factor of 3, QUORUM means 2 nodes must acknowledge. This is the most commonly used level in production because it provides a good balance:\n\nSimilar to QUORUM, but only counts replicas in the local data center. This is crucial for multi-datacenter deployments because you don’t want to wait for cross-datacenter network latency on every write.\n\nThe coordinator waits for all replica nodes to acknowledge. This provides the strongest consistency but has the worst availability; if even one replica is down, writes fail. Generally not recommended for production.\n\nThis is an interesting case. The write is considered successful if it can be written to at least one node, or if it can be stored as a hint for a temporarily unavailable node. More on hints below.\n\nConsider a cluster with a replication factor of 3, and you issue a write with consistency level QUORUM:\n\nThe entire operation typically completes in 2-5ms, depending on network latency and load.\n\nNow let’s dive deeper into how data actually gets replicated across nodes. The replication happens synchronously as part of the write operation; there’s no separate background replication process for normal writes.\n\nWhen the coordinator receives a write, it immediately forwards the mutation to all replica nodes (as determined by the replication strategy and replication factor). These writes happen in parallel. The coordinator just waits as per the consistency level, but it still writes to all the replicas synchronously.\n\nHere’s what actually gets sent over the network:\n\nEach replica node processes this mutation independently through its own CommitLog → MemTable path.\n\nCassandra uses last-write-wins (LWW) conflict resolution based on timestamps. Every mutation includes a timestamp (in microseconds), and when multiple versions of the same data exist, the one with the highest timestamp wins.\n\nTimestamps can come from two sources:\n\nIf your cluster’s clocks are not synchronized (using NTP), you can get unexpected results. A write with timestamp 1000 can be overwritten by a later write with timestamp 999 if it arrives from a node with a clock that’s behind.\n\nHence, always use NTP to keep clocks synchronized across your cluster, with clock drift kept under 500ms.\n\nIn a distributed system, network partitions are inevitable. Cassandra handles these gracefully through its consistency model and hinted handoff mechanism.\n\nSuppose we have RF=3 (replication factor), CL=QUORUM, and Node C goes down:\n\nA hint is a special write that says, “when Node C comes back online, replay this mutation to it.” Hints are stored on the coordinator (or other available nodes) in a system table.\n\nWhen Node C comes back online, other nodes detect it and start replaying hints to it. This brings Node C up to date with the writes it missed while down.\n\nImportant limitations of hints:\n\nEven with a hinted handoff, replicas can get out of sync. Cassandra uses read repair to detect and fix inconsistencies during read operations.\n\nWhen you read with a consistency level higher than ONE, the coordinator sends read requests to multiple replicas and compares their responses. If it finds differences, it:\n\nThis happens transparently and helps maintain eventual consistency. We can also enable read_repair_chance for additional background repair:\n\nThis tells Cassandra to perform read repair on 10% of reads, even if the consistency level is ONE. However, this feature is often disabled in modern Cassandra (3.0+) in favor of explicit repair operations.\n\nCassandra is write-optimized. A single node can handle 10,000-50,000 writes per second, depending on:\n\nThe write path is designed for speed:\n\nThese are remarkably consistent because writes don’t involve disk reads—only sequential appends to the CommitLog.\n\nHigher consistency levels increase latency because the coordinator must wait for more acknowledgments.\n\nCassandra supports batches, but they’re not always a performance win:\n\nLogged batches (default) use a batch log for atomicity, which adds overhead. They’re useful for ensuring multiple writes succeed or fail together, but they’re slower than individual writes.\n\nUnlogged batches skip the batch log and are faster, but they don’t guarantee atomicity. They’re only useful for performance when writing to the same partition:\n\nWriting to the same partition repeatedly can create “hot spots.” Cassandra performs best when writes are distributed across many partitions. If you have a counter table that updates the same partition millions of times, you’ll experience performance degradation.\n\nAs SSTables accumulate, read performance degrades (you have to check more files) and disk space increases (duplicate and deleted data). Compaction solves this by merging SSTables and removing deleted or overwritten data.\n\nCompaction runs in the background but competes for I/O resources. Heavy compaction can temporarily impact write performance. You can tune compaction with:\n\nCassandra deployments often span multiple datacenters for disaster recovery and geographical distribution. This is how replication works across datacenters.\n\nWhen a write arrives at a coordinator in us-east with consistency level LOCAL_QUORUM:\n\nCross-datacenter replication is still synchronous (the write is sent immediately), but LOCAL_QUORUM doesn’t wait for remote datacenters. This provides consistency within a datacenter and eventual consistency across datacenters.\n\nLOCAL_QUORUM: Most common for production\n\nEACH_QUORUM: Stronger consistency\n\nCluster with nodes A, B, C, D. Node C fails. RF=3, so data has replicas on A, B, and C.\n\nNo impact on write availability. Writes continues successfully.\n\nSame cluster, nodes B and C both fail.\n\nWrite availability is lost for data replicated to B and C. However, data replicated to other sets of nodes (e.g., A, D, E) continues working.\n\nCluster split into two groups: {A, B} and {C, D}. RF=3, CL=QUORUM.\n\nWhen the network heals, read repair and explicit repair (nodetool repair) restore consistency.\n\nSetup: Three datacenters: US (RF=3), EU (RF=3), ASIA (RF=2). US datacenter goes offline.\n\nWrite behavior with LOCAL_QUORUM in EU:\n\nNo impact on EU writes. US writes fail. ASIA applications can continue if they write to EU or ASIA with LOCAL_QUORUM.\n\nProblem: Sacrifices availability for consistency. Any single node failure causes writes to fail.\n\nSolution: Use QUORUM or LOCAL_QUORUM instead. They provide strong consistency while tolerating failures.\n\nProblem: Batching unrelated writes hurts performance and can overwhelm coordinators.\n\nSolution: Only batch writes to the same partition, or use unlogged batches when atomicity isn’t needed.\n\nProblem: Mixing client-side and server-side timestamps leads to unpredictable conflict resolution.\n\nSolution: Either always use USING TIMESTAMP or never use it. Be consistent across your application.\n\nProblem: Clock drift causes last-write-wins to produce unexpected results.\n\nSolution: Keep NTP running on all nodes with drift under 500ms. Monitor clock sync regularly.\n\nProblem: Repeatedly updating the same partition creates a bottleneck.\n\nSolution: Distribute load across partitions:\n\nEnsure your partition keys distribute data evenly:\n\nInstead of manually deleting old data, use TTL:\n\nThis is much more efficient than DELETE statements.\n\nRun regular repairs to ensure replicas stay synchronized:\n\nSchedule repairs weekly or monthly, depending on your workload.\n\nCassandra uses a Log-Structured Merge (LSM) tree to hold the data, where writes are first persisted to an append-only CommitLog before being written to an in-memory MemTable.\n\nMemTables are periodically flushed to disk as immutable SSTables, and background compaction merges them to optimize read performance. This classic Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mechanism ensures durability and high write throughput via sequential disk I/O.\n\nThe coordinator node also takes care of writing to all the replicas. In case write to one of the replicas fails or times out, then hinted handoff is leveraged to repair and maintain eventual consistency. Cassandra leverages quorum with tunable consistency levels, allowing trade-offs between consistency and availability for both reads and writes.",

    "description": "Boeing is well-known for building and manufacturing aircraft, but it also owns several aviation companies. Here's everything you need to know.",
    "fullText": "Over more than a century in the aerospace industry, Boeing has gone through many iterations. It began building primitive seaplanes in the early 20th century under the moniker Pacific Aero Products Co. — later redubbed Boeing Airplane Co. In 1961, the company ditched the qualifiers and changed its name to simply Boeing, partly because it had expanded into other arenas outside of aerospace.\n\nToday, Boeing builds military aircraft, helicopters, spacecraft, missiles, and more. Boeing also built the Lunar Roving Vehicles (the Moon buggies) which were driven by astronauts on the lunar surface during the last three Apollo missions. Boeing is also, and long has been, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial jets.\n\nBoeing is most well known for designing and manufacturing aircraft, it's a name which is almost synonymous with airplanes, but it's also a massive company with hundreds of subsidiaries. Some are research and development operations, others build parts or craft software for navigation or defense, and others create rockets and spaceships. Of course, some of Boeing's subsidiaries are precisely what you'd expect, aerospace companies doing aerospace things. Here are five aviation companies you might not know are owned by Boeing.\n\nAutonomous or remotely operated aircraft, commonly called drones or UAVs (short for uncrewed aerial vehicles), have become common in toy stores and hobby shops. You can get simple and affordable drones to fly around your backyard or more complex ones for racing, filmmaking, and other activities. Meanwhile, there's another class of drone used for scientific research and military applications. Those are the sorts of drones Insitu makes.\n\nThe company was founded in 1994, with the goal of developing small robotic aircraft, and achieved early milestones like the first uncrewed transatlantic flight in 1998. Insitu was acquired by Boeing in 2008 and, today, it's a wholly owned subsidiary of Boeing, headquartered in Bingen, Washington.\n\nWhile Boeing is mostly known for passenger airplanes, Insitu offers a range of UAVs including the Integrator VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing), Integrator extended range, Integrator, ScanEagle VTOL, ScanEagle, and RQ-21A. These can also be supplemented with payloads including cameras, laser guidance, wide-area search instruments, and more.\n\nSpirit AeroSystems (not to be confused with Spirit Airlines) began as the Stearman Aircraft Company, founded by Lloyd Stearman, back in the early 20th century. It was later purchased by The United Aircraft and Transport Company (later Boeing) in 1929.",

    "title": "Richard Petty–Owned Plymouth Superbird Fails to Sell Despite Record-Level Bids",
    "description": "A 1970 Plymouth Superbird tied to Richard Petty misses reserve again, raising questions about expectations, not the collector car market.",
    "fullText": "A 1970 Plymouth Superbird with a direct connection to NASCAR legend Richard Petty has once again left an auction unsold, despite drawing bids that exceeded known benchmarks for similar cars. The Alpine White Superbird, powered by a 440 cubic-inch four-barrel V8 and paired with a three-speed automatic transmission, failed to meet its reserve during a recent online auction, marking the third unsuccessful attempt to sell the car in 2024.\n\nThe Superbird was previously offered at Mecum Kissimmee in January, where bidding climbed to $550,000. That figure set a record high for a Superbird equipped with a non-Hemi 440 engine, yet the seller declined the offer. Following that result, the car was listed privately at Graham Rahal Performance for $699,995, a price typically associated with rarer Hemi-powered examples.\n\nMost recently, the car crossed the block on Bring a Trailer, where bidding reached $385,000 before again falling short of the undisclosed reserve. While lower than the January figure, the final bid still exceeded established market norms for this configuration.\n\nThe car holds notable provenance, having been displayed at the Petty Museum and featuring cosmetic tributes to its famous association. These include embroidered seats, a signed glove box, and special decals honoring Petty’s NASCAR legacy. Although it was not Petty’s personal street car, its connection to the seven-time NASCAR champion adds historical appeal.\n\nThe Superbird has reportedly been refurbished to near-original condition and presents as a high-quality example. Still, collectors traditionally place the highest value on Hemi-powered wing cars, leaving the 375-horsepower 440 four-barrel models at a disadvantage in the market hierarchy.\n\nSpeculation about a broader collapse in the classic car market has grown in recent years, fueled by shifting generational interests and demographic changes among collectors. However, the bidding history of this Superbird suggests a different story. According to Classic.com data, the average sale price for a 440 four-barrel Superbird is $225,100, with the previous record sale reaching $324,500 in September 2022.\n\nBoth recent auction results exceeded that record, indicating continued buyer interest and strong demand. Rather than signaling market weakness, the repeated no-sales appear to reflect a seller holding out for pricing typically reserved for more desirable Hemi-equipped examples. In this case, the market has spoken clearly, even if the owner has chosen not to listen—at least for now.\n\n⚡️ Read the full article on Motorious",

    "fullText": "LONDON (AP) — Political opposition leaders in the United Kingdom have called for a human rights activist to be stripped of his citizenship over past social media posts allegedly containing violent and antisemitic language within days of the dual national returning to Britain after years in Egyptian prisons.\n\nThe leaders of the Conservative and Reform parties also demanded the deportation of Alaa Abd el-Fattah following the discovery of tweets from more than a decade ago in which he allegedly endorsed killing “Zionists’’ and police.\n\n“The comments he made on social media about violence against Jews, white people and the police, amongst others, are disgusting and abhorrent,” Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch wrote Monday in the Daily Mail newspaper.\n\nAbd el-Fattah on Monday apologized for the tweets while saying some had been taken out of context and misrepresented.\n\nThe activist has spent years in Egyptian prisons, most recently for allegedly spreading fake news about the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. He returned to the U.K. on Friday after Egyptian authorities lifted a travel ban that had forced him to remain in the country since he was released in September.\n\nBut he immediately became embroiled in controversy after Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was “delighted” that Abd el-Fattah was back in the UK and had been reunited with his family.\n\nThat triggered the republication of messages on the social media platform Twitter, now X, that were described as antisemitic, homophobic and anti-British.\n\nAbd el-Fattah expressed shock at the turn of events in a statement released Monday.\n\n“I am shaken that, just as I am being reunited with my family for the first time in 12 years, several historic tweets of mine have been republished and used to question and attack my integrity and values, escalating to calls for the revocation of my citizenship,’’ he said.\n\nThe remarks were mostly expressions of a young man’s anger and frustrations in a time of regional crises such as the wars in Iraq, Lebanon and Gaza and the rise of police brutality against young people in Egypt, Abd el-Fattah said.\n\n“Looking at the tweets now — the ones that were not completely twisted out of their meaning — I do understand how shocking and hurtful they are, and for that I unequivocally apologise,’’ he said in the statement.\n\nBut that has not staunched the flow of anger from politicians.\n\nReform Party leader Nigel Farage described the posts as “abhorrent” and said they showed Abd el-Fattah held views that are “completely opposed to our British way of life.”\n\n“It should go without saying that anyone who possesses racist and anti-British views such as those of Mr. elFattah (sic) should not be allowed into the UK,” Farage wrote in a letter to Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, who oversees immigration matters.",

Per QSR magazine, Arby’s was third in 2024 in the United States market for sandwich sales, placing behind Subway and Panera.\n\nAnd its parent company, Inspire Brands, reported that Arby’s did $29.5 billion in sales in 2024.\n\nSo, why is the chain now shutting down shop on so many locations?\n\nWell, per The Independent, despite the impressive numbers, Arby’s saw a 6.3% drop in sales overall last year. The outlet said Arby’s has also been battling rising costs and lower consumer spending, which led to the dip in overall sales.\n\nGood news for fans of the roast beef giant in Pennsylvania is that, so far, none of the shuttered locations have come in the Keystone State.

    "fullText": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) — Western New York’s latest winter storm has prompted Gov. Kathy Hochul to issue an advisory to caution commuters to stay off the roads and work from home if they can Monday.\n\nWith whiteout conditions expected at times along with wind gusts projected to reach upwards of 75 miles per hour — as well as the potential for flooding — Gov. Hochul is urging anyone who can to stay off the roads Monday evening, especially during the evening rush hour commute.\n\nWIVB News 4 was able to speak with Gov. Hochul on Sunday evening over the phone, where she also encouraged Western New Yorkers who can to work from home and avoid going out on the roadways.\n\n“Western New Yorkers, myself included, we think we’re tough, we can handle anything, but when you’re on the roads and there’s 50, 60, 70 mile-an-hour winds and the wind is blowing, it is a dangerous condition. And we want to encourage people if you can, stay off the roads, especially during tomorrow night’s commute from 4 to 7,” Gov. Hochul told News 4. “Just over the next couple of days if you can work remotely or stay home with the kids, forget returning that one item to the store that you don’t like for Christmas, you can do that later, just help us keep the roads clear. Stay home, stay safe.”\n\nAhead of the worst of the storm Monday, Gov. Hochul emphasized how her administration will continue to coordinate with local leaders to help keep Western New Yorkers safe from what’s expected to be, at times, a very severe winter weather event for parts of our area.\n\nA state of emergency that was declared by Gov. Hochul on Friday for more than half of New York’s counties remains in effect headed into Monday in anticipation of the worst of the storm.\n\nA flood watch has also been issued for parts of Western New York, as a slight risk of excessive rainfall is possible as a result of the storm. One to two inches of rain could cause flooding around rivers, creeks, streams and other low-lying areas.\n\nParts of Western New York could see between 1 and 2 feet of snow with this system, combined with high winds and cold temperatures. Snowfall rates of up to two inches an hour and strong winds will create significant blowing and drifting snow and near whiteout conditions in lake-effect areas.\n\nState and local leaders continue to coordinate ahead of the worst of the storm, taking steps to close certain highways where conditions could be very dangerous and life-threatening.\n\n“New Yorkers should monitor local forecasts and take caution to avoid travel in impacted areas,” Gov. Hochul said in a statement. “Plow crews, emergency management teams and utility personnel have been deployed and are ready to keep New Yorkers safe throughout the storm.”\n\nBeginning at 6 a.m. on Monday morning until further notice, an empty tractor trailer and tandem ban will be taking place on the following state highways in Western New York:\n\nI-90 (Thruway Authority Section from Exit 46 to the PA Line both east and westbound)\n\nI-990 (I-90 to State Route 263 Millersport Highway)\n\nRoute 400 (I-90 to State Route 16)\n\nRoute 219 (I-90 to State Route 39)\n\nThe City of Buffalo on Monday morning issued a travel advisory, effective immediately. The advisory was issued due to gusty winds combined with incoming snow creating “extreme whiteout conditions, reduced visibility, and hazardous travel conditions.”\n\n“City officials urge residents to avoid unnecessary travel, use caution if travel is required, and allow additional time to reach destinations,” the advisory said. “The City will continue to monitor weather conditions and provide updates as needed. Residents are encouraged to stay informed by signing up for BuffAlert, the City of Buffalo’s emergency notification system.”\n\nFor real-time travel information, motorists should call 511 or visit www.511NY.org, New York State’s official traffic and travel information source.\n\nRob Petree is an anchor and reporter who joined the News 4 team in 2025.

    "fullText": "Role: Reporter\nMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez is a reporter for Fortune covering general business news.\n\nA YouTube cofounder who helped pave the way for our modern, content-obsessed world is the latest tech whiz to come out against short-form videos because of their effects on kids.\n\nSteve Chen, who served as YouTube’s former chief technology officer before it was acquired by Google in 2006, railed against the TikTok-ification of online life in a talk earlier this year at Stanford Graduate School of Business.\n\n“I think TikTok is entertainment, but it’s purely entertainment,” Chen said during the talk, which was published on YouTube Friday. “It’s just for that moment. Just shorter-form content equates to shorter attention spans.”\n\nChen, who has two children with wife, Jamie Chen, said he wouldn’t want his kids only consuming short-form content, and then not be able to watch something longer than 15 minutes. He said he knows of other parents who force their kids to watch longer videos without the eye-catching colors and gimmicks that hook especially younger users. This strategy works well, he claims.\n\n“If they don’t get exposure to the short-form content right away, then they’re still happy with that other type of content that they’re watching,” he said.\n\nMany companies have had to rush to offer short-form content after the rise of TikTok, he said, but these companies now have to balance their motivations for monetization and attracting users’ attention with content that’s “actually useful.”\n\nCompanies that distribute short-form video, which includes his former company YouTube, could face problems with addictiveness. These companies should add safeguards for kids on short-form content, such as age restrictions for apps and limits on the amount of time some users can use them, he said.\n\nChen joins fellow tech trailblazers Sam Altman of OpenAI and Elon Musk in sounding the alarm about social media’s impact on children. In a podcast interview, Altman specifically called out social media scrolling and the “dopamine hit” of short-form video for “probably messing with kids’ brain development in a super deep way.”\n\nMusk, who owns the social network X (née Twitter), said in 2023 he doesn’t have any restrictions on social-media use for his children, but added this “might have been a mistake,” and encouraged parents to take a more active role in their kids’ social-media habits.\n\n“I think, probably, I would limit social media a bit more than I have in the past and just take note of what they’re watching, because I think at this point they’re being programmed by some social media algorithms, which you may or may not agree with,” Musk said.\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on July 29, 2025.",

And he's not shy about it.\n\n\"Listen, I'm going to tell you something most people don't want to hear,\" O'Leary said in a December YouTube video titled \"If You Want To Get Rich, Stop Buying These 5 Things.\" \"You're broke. Not because you don't make enough money, not because the economy is rigged against you, not because you didn't get lucky. You're broke because you keep buying stupid things that are keeping you poor.\"\n\nFrom the first line, O'Leary makes it clear—building wealth doesn't start with more income. It starts with cutting the nonsense.\n\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nHave $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone — don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\n\nHis first target? That shiny new car in your driveway.\n\n\"Buying a new car is one of the dumbest financial decisions you can make,\" O'Leary said. A car drops 20% to 30% in value the second you drive it off the lot, he explained, turning thousands of dollars into dust—for nothing but \"that new car smell.\" And leasing? \"Leasing is the absolute worst,\" he said. \"You're renting a depreciating asset… You gave the dealership thousands of dollars for the privilege of borrowing their car.\"\n\nHis advice is brutal but simple: \"Buy a three-year-old certified pre-owned car. Let somebody else take the depreciation hit. That's what rich people do.\"\n\nO'Leary isn't just coming for your car. He's coming for your kitchen—or more accurately, the one you refuse to use. \"People tell me they don't have money to invest. And then I watch them spend $15 on a salad for lunch,\" he said. That's not a splurge. It's financial self-sabotage.\n\nThe average American spends nearly $4,000 a year eating out, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. O'Leary runs the math: investing that same $3,500 annually for 30 years at 10% could become more than $600,000. \"You're trading half a million dollars in retirement wealth for convenience and fancy meals you'll forget about in 24 hours,\" he said.\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nPack your lunch.

That's not living well. That's being financially irresponsible.\"",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — China's military on Monday dispatched air, navy and missile units to conduct joint live-fire drills around the island of Taiwan, which Beijing called a “stern warning” against separatist and “external interference” forces. Taiwan said it was placing forces on alert and called the Chinese government “the biggest destroyer of peace.”\n\nTaiwan’s aviation authority said more than 100,000 international air travelers would be affected by flight cancellations or diversions.\n\nThe drills came after Beijing expressed anger at what could be the largest-ever U.S. arms sale to the self-ruled territory, and at a statement by Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, saying its military could get involved if China takes action against Taiwan. China says Taiwan must come under its rule.\n\nChina's military did not mention the United States and Japan in its statement on Monday, but Beijing's foreign ministry accused Taiwan's ruling party of trying to seek independence through requesting U.S. support.\n\nTaiwan’s Defense Ministry said rapid response exercises were underway, with forces on high alert. “The Chinese Communist Party’s targeted military exercises further confirm its nature as an aggressor and the biggest destroyer of peace,” it said.\n\nBeijing sends warplanes and navy vessels toward the island on a near-daily basis, and in recent years it has stepped up the scope and scale of the exercises.\n\nSenior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson of China's People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command, said the drills would be conducted in the Taiwan Strait and areas to the north, southwest, southeast and east of the island.\n\nShi said activities would focus on sea-air combat readiness patrol, “joint seizure of comprehensive superiority” and blockades on key ports. It was the first large-scale military drill where the command publicly mentioned one goal was “all-dimensional deterrence outside the island chain.\"\n\n“It is a stern warning against ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces, and it is a legitimate and necessary action to safeguard China’s sovereignty and national unity,” Shi said.\n\nChina and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949, when a civil war brought the Communist Party to power in Beijing. Defeated Nationalist Party forces fled to Taiwan. The island has operated since then with its own government, though the mainland’s government claims it as sovereign territory.\n\nDrills will continue on Tuesday\n\nChina's command on Monday deployed destroyers, frigates, fighters, bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles, alongside long-range rockets, to the north and southwest of the Taiwan Strait. It carried out live-fire exercises against targets in the waters. Among other training, drills to test the capabilities of sea-air coordination and precise target hunting were conducted in the waters and airspace to the east of the strait.\n\nHsieh Jih-sheng, deputy chief of the general staff for intelligence of the Taiwanese Defense Ministry, said that as of 3 p.m. Monday, 89 aircraft and drones were operating around the strait, with 67 of them entering the “response zone\" — airspace under the force's monitoring and response. The ministry detected 14 navy ships around the strait and four other warships in the Western Pacific, in addition to 14 coast guard vessels.\n\n“Conducting live-fire exercises around the Taiwan Strait ... does not only mean military pressure on us. It may bring more complex impact and challenges to the international community and neighboring countries,” Hsieh told reporters.\n\nMilitary drills are set to continue Tuesday. Taiwan's Civil Aviation Administration said Chinese authorities had issued a notice saying seven temporary dangerous zones would be set up around the strait to carry out rocket-firing exercises from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., barring aircraft from entering them.\n\nThe Taiwanese aviation authority said more than 850 international flights were initially scheduled during that period and the drills would affect over 100,000 travelers. Over 80 domestic flights, involving around 6,000 passengers, were also canceled, it added.\n\nCommercial airlines began to announce dozens of cancellations and delays for domestic routes across Taiwan, particularly ones along islands near China.\n\nThe Chinese command released themed posters about the drills online accompanied by provocative wording. One depicted two shields with the Great Wall alongside three military aircraft and two ships. Its social media post said the drills were about the “Shield of Justice, Smashing Illusion,\" adding that any foreign interlopers or separatists touching the shields would be eliminated.\n\nLast week, Beijing imposed sanctions against 20 U.S. defense-related companies and 10 executives, a week after Washington announced large-scale arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion. It still requires approval by the U.S. Congress.\n\nUnder U.S. federal law in place for many years, Washington is obligated to assist Taipei with its defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China. The U.S. and Taiwan had formal diplomatic relations until 1979, when President Jimmy Carter’s administration recognized and established relations with Beijing.\n\nAsked about the drills, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party has attempted \"to seek independence by soliciting U.S. support and even risk turning Taiwan into a powder keg and ammunition depot.”\n\n“External forces’ attempts to use Taiwan to contain China and to arm Taiwan will only embolden the Taiwan independence forces and push the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war,” he said.\n\nThere was no immediate U.S. statement on the drills.\n\nKaren Kuo, spokesperson for the Taiwanese president's office, said the drills were undermining the stability and security of the Taiwan Strait and Indo-Pacific region and openly challenging international law and order.\n\n“Our country strongly condemns the Chinese authorities for disregarding international norms and using military intimidation to threaten neighboring countries.” she said.\n\nTaiwan's Defense Ministry released a video that featured its weapons and forces in a show of resilience. Multiple French Mirage-2000 aircraft conducted landings at an air force base.\n\nIn October, the Taiwanese government said it would accelerate the building of a “Taiwan Shield” or “T-Dome” air defense system in the face of the military threat from China.\n\nThe military tensions came a day after Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said he hoped the Taiwan Strait would be associated with peace and prosperity, instead of “crashing waves and howling winds,\" during a trip to Shanghai.",

Around 7:30 a.m., the Michigan Department of Transportation said northbound I-196 was closed at mile marker 36, which is in the area of Blue Star Highway near Douglas. It remained closed as of 12:30 p.m.\n\nCloser to Holland, a jackknifed semi-truck shut down southbound I-196 west of 60th Street, Allegan County Emergency Management said around 9:30 a.m.\n\nIn Saugatuck Township, a semi-truck was heading north on I-196 when it crashed through the railing and went onto Old Allegan Road, Fire Chief Greg Janik told News 8. The crash shut down the road for hours. The southbound lanes reopened around 10 a.m., but several miles of northbound I-196 remained closed as of 12:30 p.m.\n\nCrews respond to power outages across West Michigan\n\nIn Allendale, a News 8 crew saw a rollover crash on 68th Avenue between Lincoln and Warner streets.

    "description": "The \"hell gate\" artifact of the Olmec jaguar god was stolen over 100 years ago. Now, it's back home in Mexico after years of searching and restoration efforts.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nOriginally stolen sometime in the early 20th century, a “portal to the underworld” depicting the Olmec jaguar god Tepeyollotlicuhti returned to its Mexican home in May of 2023.\n\nBecause the looters broke the object into smaller pieces, Mexican authorities with the government’s National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) spent a year restoring the statue to its former glory.\n\nThe return of the statue was the result of a decades-long effort among archeologists and officials working in stolen antiquities.\n\nSometime in the early 20th century (officials aren’t sure exactly when), looters made off with a 2,700-year-old treasure of the Mexican-based Olmecs—one of North America’s first major civilizations. The artifact was a six-foot-by-five-foot Olmec Cave Mask, also known as a Portal al Inframundo (“passage to the underworld”), depicting the Olmec jaguar god Tepeyollotlicuhti with its flaring eyes and gaping mouth.\n\nOriginally located in Chalcatzingo in the Mexican state of Morelos—an area famous for its Olmec artwork and iconography—the looted statue went on a decades-long journey, winding in and out of different museums and private collections in the United States. Eventually, this ancient hell gate wound up in Denver in 2023 and, finally, authorities from the Antiquities Trafficking Unit based in New York City secured the masterpiece. Within a couple months, the long-missing statue made a return trip to Mexico.\n\n“This incredible, ancient piece is a rare window into the past of Olmec society,” New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a press statement at the time. “Like many other looted antiquities, the Olmec Cave Mask was broken into several different pieces to make the smuggling process simpler.”\n\nThe National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), a group within Mexico’s Ministry of Culture (which has been leading the restoration), says the statue was actually broken into 25 pieces. As a result, experts have been working on the piece in situ to “provide greater stability and coherent visual reading,” according to a press release.\n\n“Some elements that make it up are original, but others, such as a metal structure based on bolts, cement reinforcements and replacements of missing parts and shapes, were added to give it stability again, even though the techniques and materials were not the most appropriate,” INAH’s Castro Barrera said in a statement translated into English.\n\nSome of those structural elements will likely remain in place going forward.\n\nAmazingly, this cultural wonder would’ve likely never returned to its native soil without the tireless effort of archaeologist David Grove, who was the first to link the Olmec artifact to the one missing from Chalcatzingo. INAH’s Mario Córdova Tello eventually proved that the artifact was indeed stolen, and even pinpointed its location in Colorado, in the hands of a private collector in 2008. Tragically, Grove—who was so instrumental in the object’s repatriation—died the day before the statue arrived in Mexico.\n\nUnfortunately, the Tepeyollotlicuhti portal is only one example of the many priceless antiquities that have been looted from native lands and now illegally reside—both knowingly and unknowingly—in collections and museums around the world. But as pressure rises for museums to return these prized treasures, maybe they’ll also get a long-awaited trip back home one day.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

It's the kind of ammunition that can be helpful even if you're not leaving your job but want to ask for a promotion or a raise.\n\n\"What are the top things that really showcase the impact that you've made?\" she previously told Business Insider.\n\nIf your workplace slows down around the holidays, you might take advantage of the extra time to set some goals.\n\nIt can be helpful to think about what you've admired about great bosses or coworkers and what you might be able to emulate, said Ashley Herd, author of the upcoming book \"The Manager Method,\" and a former head of HR for North America at McKinsey & Company.\n\nMaybe you had a mentor who was a great communicator or was willing to help you figure out something that wasn't in their job description, she said.\n\nHerd said it's wise to think about those admirable behaviors you've seen in others and then consider what you want to be known for on the job.\n\nThough it might feel awkward at first, she said, you can also ask trusted colleagues what they've appreciated about working with you — and then plan to lean into that.\n\nIt can also be helpful to ask coworkers about the things they've seen others do that are helpful.\n\n\"Some of that is crowdsourcing in the most non-cringy way,\" Herd said.\n\nHerd said it's also worth identifying the things that might have frustrated you over the past year. If you were too bogged down with work, she said, it's reasonable to ask, \"Did other people know what was on my plate?\" As a follow-up, think, \"How can I talk about that productively?\"\n\nFrom there, she said, it's often worth considering what you'd like to see in the year ahead as it pertains to your day-to-day work and long-term career, and how you'll communicate that to your boss.\n\nShe said that if you keep your thoughts about what you're seeking to yourself, you run the risk that you might not, for example, get that promotion you've been gunning for.\n\n\"It's thinking about how you really advocate for yourself and have those conversations,\" Herd said.\n\nNot every consideration for the new year has to be lofty. Some can just come down to how you want to use your time. Chances are, you're not thinking, \"More meetings, please.\"\n\nMeetings can be great ways to reach consensus on to-dos and priorities. Yet they can also be a time suck.\n\nThe end of the year is a great time to review your calendar and identify any meetings that can be pruned, allowing you to have more time to focus on actual work in the coming year.\n\nIn some cases, it's a matter of asking your boss or the meeting organizer whether you need to attend a call, whether the group could meet less frequently, or whether there's some other way to share updates.\n\nSurveys have found that the amount of time spent in meetings often increases as the months go by, so it can be helpful to reduce it where possible before the new year begins.\n\nIf you're feeling ambitious, you might push for a different setup — like having a day or two a week that are entirely free from meetings.\n\nDo you have a story to share about your career?

    "description": "A report by the Israel Advanced Technology Industries warned that the trend could threaten Israel's \"innovation engine.\"",
    "fullText": "Increasing numbers of employees at multinational tech firms in Israel have requested to be relocated abroad over the last year, as security concerns amid the Israel-Hamas war heightened, a new report says.\n\nThe Israel Advanced Technology Industries Association (IATI) said in a report published last week that 53% of multinational companies had reported increases in relocation requests, as \"security and geopolitical concerns\" became \"increasingly influential.\"\n\nThe report did not identify specific companies. Some of the world's largest tech companies have a presence in Israel, including Apple, Meta, Nvidia, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and Google.\n\n\"The relocation risk poses a direct threat to Israel's innovation engines,\" the NGO said, adding: \"A significant wave of employee departures could undermine local innovation capabilities and weaken Israel's technological leadership.\"\n\nThe report found recruitment increases among multinationals in Israel had nevertheless exceeded decreases during the war, which it said highlighted the \"organizational resilience and continued investment in talent\" from these companies.\n\nThe data came from a mix of industry reports and public sources, as well as surveys and interviews with tech executives in multinational entities, the IATI said.\n\nIsrael's tech sector is a key driver of its economy. The Israel Innovation Authority, a government body, said the tech industry contributed one-fifth of the country's GDP in 2023. It labeled the high-tech sector \"the shock absorber of the Israeli economy.\"\n\nThe IATI report said that there are around 430 multinational companies in Israel, with around 90,000 high-tech employees working for them.\n\nIt added that while multinationals had shown resilience over the course of the war — which broke out following the October 7 attacks on Israel — many had also faced business headwinds.\n\nAround 22% of companies recorded reduced business activity during the conflict, it said, with 8% reporting a significant decline. However, 57% reported no change in business activity over the period and 21% expanded operations, per the report, which the IATI said showed \"continued confidence in and robustness of local MNC activity.\"\n\nDror Bin, the CEO of the Israel Innovation Authority, previously said that the Israeli economy's dependence on the high-tech sector had \"significantly grown in the past decade.\"\n\n\"We must do everything necessary to preserve the industry and continue nurturing its competitiveness in the global market,\" he added.",

    "description": "Teresa Johnson shares how a leap of faith on a pottery studio grew into Color Me Mine, now earning $55 million and transforming her family's future.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Teresa Johnson, CEO of Color Me Mine. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2005, I was working in a corporate HR role, thinking I was the definition of success. Then, the president of the company walked into my office and explained that the business wasn't doing well. We should start our own business, he said.\n\nAt the time, I didn't know anyone who ran their own business, but I had always been drawn to entrepreneurship. Still, I was a single mom with a mortgage to pay, so I needed to be practical.\n\nThat's when I received an email from a paint-your-own pottery studio that my daughter and I occasionally visited. The owner said she was selling. I thought, \"There's my sign.\" I purchased the business by charging $25,000 to my credit card.\n\nRunning the pottery business was still intense. The studio was open seven days a week, and my daughter Scout was there most of them, setting out brushes and cleaning tables. Scout was only in second grade, but she and I learned how to be entrepreneurs together over the years.\n\nDecember is our busy season, and one night we were at the studios late, tying ribbons on ceramic ornaments. I asked Scout what her friend was doing that night, and she said, \"studying for finals.\" Finals were the next day, and I had my teenager working. That wasn't one of my proudest parenting moments.\n\nStill, Scout loved the business as much as I did. When she was a sophomore, she called and asked me to meet her for lunch. When I got there, Scout was with a real estate agent. We had already opened three locations, and Scout wanted to be my partner on a fourth. I said, \"You don't even have a driver's license,\" and she said, \"You don't need a driver's license to open a business.\"\n\nScout really ran that location — she attended all the town meetings and handled the hiring. Eventually, it helped her get a college scholarship for entrepreneurship. It absolutely changed her life, and I'm so proud of the businesswoman she's become.\n\nJust like Scout, I was learning a ton about entrepreneurship. In 2010, I opened a franchise of a company called Painting with a Twist. I wanted to learn about franchising from the inside, because I saw it as a good business opportunity.\n\nLast year, Color Me Mine franchises generated more than $55 million in sales worldwide. I'm still not comfortable talking about my own financial status, or even acknowledging it. It makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up.\n\nI think that's because life was hard when I quit my corporate job to start the business. Because I didn't grow up with wealth, I didn't miss it, however. Scout and I were always fine, and she learned hard lessons about work ethic.\n\nEntrepreneurship has never been about the money for me. It's about altering the course for an entire family. I get so much fulfillment out of seeing our franchisees do that. Buying a business changed my life, and Scout's life, too. I'm grateful to be able to help other families do the same.",

    "description": "Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang rose from his first job at Denny's, where the idea for his company was born, to leading a chipmaking giant.",
    "fullText": "The AI arms race has been good business for Nvidia, which supplies the highly in-demand chips used by many Big Tech giants and startups alike to train AI models.\n\nThat's also been good news for Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang. In 2024, he shot into Forbes' list of the world's 10 wealthiest people as business boomed for Nvidia.\n\nHuang and fellow Nvidia founders Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky planted the seed for Nvidia at a Denny's in northern California in 1993. Today, it's a household name in the AI industry, and Huang is the billionaire businessman leading it.\n\nHere's a look at Jensen Huang's career rise and background.\n\nHuang was born in Taiwan in 1963. He spent some of his childhood there and in Thailand before his parents sent Huang and his brother to the US to live with an uncle in Tacoma, Washington.\n\nHis uncle sent him to Oneida Baptist Institute in Kentucky, but after Huang's parents immigrated to the US, the family lived in Oregon. He graduated from high school at age 16 before going to college. Huang got his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Oregon State University and his master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University.\n\nHuang got his first job at 15. He washed dishes and bussed and waited tables at a Denny's in Portland.\n\nBefore founding Nvidia, Huang worked at computer chip manufacturer LSI Logic from 1985 to 1993 and at semiconductor company AMD, or Advanced Micro Devices, from 1984 to 1985.\n\nAt a Denny's in 1993, Huang and his Nvidia co-founders, Curtis Priem and Chris Malachowsky, came up with the idea that would eventually lead to Nvidia's creation.\n\nIn 1999, the company released the GeForce 256, which it called the first graphics processing unit, or GPU.\n\nToday, Nvidia is instrumental in the generative AI industry, supplying the coveted chips that tech companies use to train AI models.\n\nInterest in Nvidia's chips amid the AI boom has pushed the company to new heights.\n\nIn 2023, Nvidia joined the handful of companies at the time with a trillion-dollar market cap, becoming one of the most valuable companies in the world.\n\nHuang's net worth is $165.4 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nHuang's management and leadership style sees him skipping 1-on-1 meetings, managing around 60 direct reports as CEO, giving feedback publicly, and sending his staff hundreds of emails a day.\n\nCurrent and former Nvidia employees previously told BI that Huang is a hands-on boss with high expectations and meticulous attention to detail who values owning up to your mistakes.\n\nHuang has said he has workaholic tendencies, logging 14-hour days and working on holidays.\n\nHe has a tattoo of Nvidia's logo on his shoulder, which he agreed to get when the company's stock price hit $100 per share.\n\nHuang's black leather jacket has also become a famous part of his wardrobe — a staple piece he often wears when giving keynotes or showing off a new product.\n\nNvidia's other founders, meanwhile, have stayed further out of the spotlight than Huang.\n\nPriem was Nvidia's chief technical officer from 1993 to 2003, and Malachowsky is a senior technology executive at Nvidia.\n\nAfter Nvidia went public in 1999, Priem put more than three-quarters of his Nvidia shares into his Priem Family Foundation and by 2006, he'd sold the rest of his shares. He was left with a fortune of roughly $30 million, Forbes estimated in 2023.\n\nHuang met his now-wife, Lori, while still attending Oregon State University. The couple share two children: Madison Huang is a director of product and technical marketing at Nvidia, and Spencer Huang is a product line manager at the company.\n\nHuang and Lisa Su, CEO of Nvidia's rival chip giant AMD, are distant cousins.\n\nHe has a home in Silicon Valley, as Nvidia is headquartered in Santa Clara, California.\n\nHuang has been president, CEO, and a member of Nvidia's board of directors since the company's creation. He and Nvidia haven't said much about succession planning.\n\nHe was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2024 and has received the Semiconductor Industry Association's highest honor, the Robert N. Noyce Award.\n\nIn past years, The Economist has named Huang the world's best CEO, Fortune has dubbed him its Businessperson of the Year, and TIME has included him in its yearly list of the world's 100 most influential people.\n\nAs of June 2025, Huang owned roughly 3.77% of the company's outstanding shares, according to a proxy statement. He is Nvidia's largest individual shareholder.\n\nHuang led Nvidia through a record-breaking, blockbuster year in 2025 as the AI boom saw no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe chipmaker became the first company in the world to cross the $5-trillion market cap valuation on October 29, 2025.\n\nAt the same time, the CEO steered the company through increased competition as AI hyperscalers explore alternative chips, regulatory headwinds, and growing concerns of an AI bubble.\n\nHuang acknowledged, in an internal meeting, the challenges of running a company faced with sky-high expectations after Nvidia delivered a better-than-expected quarter in November 2025.\n\n\"If we delivered a bad quarter, it is evidence there's an AI bubble,\" he said in the meeting. \"If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble.\"",

    "title": "AI won't hollow out white-collar jobs, it will fuel growth — says Box CEO Aaron Levie",
    "description": "Box CEO Aaron Levie says AI lowers costs for knowledge tasks, allowing companies to expand work and drive white-collar job growth.",
    "fullText": "Some tech leaders and AI researchers have predicted that AI will hollow out white-collar jobs.\n\nBut Aaron Levie, the cofounder and CEO of cloud-storage giant Box, believes it will push companies to do far more work.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post on Sunday, Levie said AI will sharply reduce the cost of knowledge tasks such as writing code and reviewing contracts.\n\nAs those tasks get cheaper, he said, companies will take on more projects that were previously too expensive or complex to justify, and, ultimately, create jobs rather than eliminate them.\n\nTo explain why, Levie pointed to economist William Stanley Jevons.\n\nIn 1865, Jevons observed that more efficient steam engines didn't curb coal use in England but drove it higher, as cheaper energy fueled new industries — a dynamic now known as the Jevons paradox.\n\nLevie said the same pattern has repeated itself in computing, with each major wave of cheaper technology — from mainframes to minicomputers to PCs — dramatically expanding adoption.\n\nCloud computing followed a similar path, erasing many of the advantages large companies once had in procurement, infrastructure, and maintenance, and putting tools like accounting software, CRM systems, and marketing platforms within reach of nearly any business, he said.\n\nThose efficiency gains automated deterministic work, Levie said — tasks with clear rules and predictable outcomes, such as accounting, record-keeping, scheduling, and data processing, where the same inputs reliably produce the same result.\n\nLevie's broader argument stands in contrast to warnings from other AI leaders and economists.\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Ford CEO Jim Farley have warned that the technology could wipe out large numbers of white-collar roles, while figures such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, and Elon Musk have predicted outcomes ranging from major disruption to longer-term economic gains.\n\nOthers, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta's outgoing chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, have predicted AI will reshape how work is done rather than eliminate it outright.\n\nWhile major tech companies such as HP, IBM, Salesforce, and Amazon have cut thousands of jobs amid AI-driven efficiency pushes, KPMG's chief economist Diane Swonk has warned the US could face a \"jobless boom\" in 2026 as firms do more with fewer workers.\n\nLevie said AI changes the equation by targeting non-deterministic work, which involves judgment, creativity, and ambiguity.\n\nTasks, such as reviewing contracts, writing software, designing marketing campaigns, or conducting research, don't follow fixed rules and have historically required expensive human expertise, making them difficult to automate and costly to scale.\n\n\"Now, every business in the world has access to the talent and resources of a Fortune 500 company 10 years ago,\" he wrote.\n\nAs non-deterministic tasks get cheaper, Levie said, companies take on far more work, driving demand for white-collar jobs.\n\nNot everyone agrees that AI is already reshaping the job market at that level.\n\nSome economists, including Gbenga Ajilore, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, say the current white-collar downturn has more to do with high interest rates, weak hiring, and a slowing economy than AI itself.\n\nStill, Levie said fears of widespread replacement miss a key constraint.\n\n\"The reality is that despite all the tasks that AI lets us automate,\" he wrote, \"it still requires people to pull together the full workflow to produce real value.\"",

    "description": "My mom and I have completed two routes from the Camino de Santiago together. Our international trips to Europe have helped us communicate and bond.",
    "fullText": "Summer vacation is typically associated with beaches, cruise ships, and road trips. For my mom, though, it's a chance to go on a long-distance hike.\n\nShe's walked the Camino de Santiago — a network of pilgrimage routes across France, Portugal, and Spain, some of which are over 500 miles long — nine times.\n\nIt's become an annual trip for her, made possible by summers off from teaching. At some point, I began calling her a \"Camino vet\" — she even got a scallop shell tattoo to commemorate the experience.\n\nFor years, I couldn't understand what could be so enjoyable about trudging more than 10 miles a day through blazing heat with a 20-pound backpack strapped around your waist.\n\nBut as my high school graduation approached, she asked if I'd like to join her on her next walk.\n\nI agreed for a couple of reasons: curiosity, for one (I wanted to see what all the fuss was about), and secondly, who turns down a trip to Spain, no matter the conditions?\n\nIn a journal entry from my first day of walking through the Pyrenees Mountains, I wrote, \"In one word, I would describe it as 'hell.'\"\n\nStill, we persevered, walking 30 consecutive days in the heat with reemerging blisters, guided by arrows and shells that pave the way, and sleeping in hostels with fellow travelers.\n\nBut despite the challenges, it was beautiful.\n\nAlong the way, I discovered the wonders of sangria and patatas bravas (Spanish fried potatoes). We passed through the narrow streets of Pamplona, Spain, where I promised myself I'd one day return for the Festival of San Fermin, the stage for the running of the bulls.\n\nMy mom and I spent some time talking during the walk, but more often than not, I'd go ahead, determined to reach the next town as quickly as possible.\n\nAs we reached the end of our walk, I remember feeling so struck with gratitude and a sense of relief — followed by the desire to return home to the little things, like a fresh pair of socks and a home-cooked meal.\n\nSure, our journey wasn't perfect, but four years later, as my college graduation approached, I asked my mom to walk another Camino with me.\n\nIn June 2023, we embarked on another path of the Camino, this time through the southwestern French countryside.\n\nWe were welcomed at our accommodations each afternoon by hosts who would later cook us dinner — beef bourguignon in the mountain town of Saugues and duck confit in the Gascony province.\n\nMy mom and I would begin each day walking alongside each other. We talked about her desire to go back to school and obtain a bachelor's degree (she's now working toward her master's).\n\nWe discussed the books we'd been reading — a hobby she introduced me to at a young age — and reflected on my upbringing, comparing how my older sister and I were raised, among many other things.\n\nThen, through some unspoken agreement, as morning drifted into afternoon, we'd part ways for the rest of the walk.\n\nAs we fell into this routine, I realized that we pace our days the same way. We both enjoy social interaction to an extent, but still desire considerable time to ourselves.\n\nThis mutual understanding made the walk comforting and poignant. Where my focus during the first Camino was on reaching the finish line, this one was more therapeutic.\n\nMy mom's tattoo was the subject of one of the many conversations we had while walking.\n\nI no longer had to ask why she got it — I understood. Instead, I admitted that I wanted one, too. This past summer, I got a shell tattoo on my right forearm.\n\nIt's a reminder that in my mom, I have someone I can speak openly to and trust. And for that, in large part, I have our trips and the Camino to thank for bringing us closer.",

While investigators quickly determined the sounds were actually fireworks being ignited by a large crowd of \"unruly\" juveniles, the situation turned more dangerous as the crowd was dispersed.\n\n\"It can escalate from firecrackers to now its guns to life being taken. That’s something we don’t want,\" said John Williams, who was visiting the area.\n\nAs officers cleared the mall, a group of teenagers allegedly began firing actual guns near Spring Street NW and 17th Street.\n\nThe gunfire sent patrons at Nan Thai Fine Dining ducking for cover.\n\n\"Definitely about 30 shots,\" said Jedi Niyomkul, the restaurant's general manager. \"I’m making sure everyone is on the ground because we do have a lot of glass.\"\n\nNiyomkul said the restaurant was hit by at least one bullet. He expressed frustration that the crowd was pushed out of the mall but not adequately monitored once they crossed into the surrounding city streets.\n\n\"Once they got them across the bridge, there was no patrol over on this side to make sure that they dispersed,\" Niyomkul said. \"Literally at 17th and Spring, right there, 100 to 150 kids just sitting all around the corner, doing absolutely nothing, just looking for trouble.\"\n\nThe disturbance occurred despite Atlantic Station's strict codes of conduct. The district enforces a 3 p.m. curfew for anyone under 18, requiring them to be with a parent or guardian. Additionally, no one under 21 is allowed on the property after 9 p.m.\n\nAtlanta City Council member Michael Julian Bond said the city must find a more consistent way to manage large groups of youth.\n\n\"We again manage this population policy-wise, more than any other segment than our society, so we all got to step up year-round in how we manage that population,\" Bond said.\n\nInformation in this article came from Atlanta police and FOX 5's Annie Mapp speaking with Jedi Niyomkul and Michael Julian Bond.",

    "description": "Shares of Rigetti Computing have gained nearly 3,000% during the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.",
    "fullText": "Quantum computing stocks are among the hottest plays in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.\n\nPure-play developers such as Rigetti Computing are among the most popular quantum AI stocks.\n\nWhile Rigetti's momentum looks unstoppable, history suggests the company's valuation is unsustainable.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Rigetti Computing ›\n\nWhile artificial intelligence (AI) stocks performed strongly throughout 2025, one particular pocket of the AI realm sticks out from the pack: quantum computing. As of market close on Dec. 23, shares of the Defiance Quantum ETF gained 37% on the year -- more than double that of the S&P 500.\n\nSome of the biggest gainers in this exchange-traded fund (ETF) are quantum pure plays, including Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) -- whose shares have soared 46% this year.\n\nLet's dive into why there is so much excitement surrounding Rigetti Computing and assess whether the red-hot stock can keep rallying in 2026.\n\nWhile quantum AI remains an exploratory and theoretical pursuit among research labs and higher education institutions, some believe the technology has the potential to revolutionize critical applications across clinical research, financial risk, logistics, supply chain management, and manufacturing.\n\nManagement consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimates that quantum computing could add up to $2 trillion in economic value by next decade. For now, however, there are only a small number of companies dedicated to developing quantum computing technology.\n\nRigetti Computing builds quantum processors and computers that can be accessed through cloud infrastructure. By employing a vertically integrated model -- controlling the manufacturing process of its chips and designing its own software -- Rigetti aims to usher in a new era of computing beyond what today's most capable systems can handle.\n\nThis is important for the future of AI because if Rigetti achieves a quantum breakthrough, its full-stack suite across hardware and software could enable next-generation algorithms that today's GPUs simply are not designed to handle.\n\nA common mistake that beginner investors often make is following the crowd. Sometimes, investors will chase momentum stocks -- knowingly buying shares at a premium in hopes of flipping their position for a profit. This is known as the greater fool theory.\n\nSmart investors avoid this strategy. Thorough valuation analysis is required to determine whether a stock is actually a reasonable buy.",

    "description": "From wooden accents to designer throw blankets, these are the home-decor pieces an interior decorator buys at TJ Maxx.",
    "fullText": "Even interior designers and professional decorators can be proud Maxxinistas.\n\nBusiness Insider spoke with Emily Maldonado, the owner of the full-service interior decorating and home styling company Styled Mi Casa, about the home decor pieces she always buys at TJ Maxx for her clients and her own home.\n\nMaldonado has worked in mortgages, real estate, and home-flipping for over 20 years. She got into decorating and home styling when she moved to Texas, and looks for many budget-friendly items when creating her \"modern organic\" decorating style.\n\nAs people tighten their budgets, especially around the holiday season, stores like TJ Maxx could become even more popular.\n\nEarlier this month, TJ Maxx's parent company reported a 7% increase in net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, compared to the same period in 2025.\n\nHere are six things you should always buy at TJ Maxx, according to an interior decorator.\n\n\"I try to bring something with a wooden element into every single space that I design, just to add that warmth,\" Maldonado told Business Insider, \"and TJ Maxx is great for that.\"\n\n\"Whether it's a beautiful tone of wood in a cutting board or a nice vessel or a pot, or it's even just a little wooden ball,\" there are usually a variety of pieces that will add texture and coziness to a space, she said.\n\n\"You can find pieces made of wood or iron or metal or things that are imported from India,\" Maldonado said. \"And those are the ideal things that I'm always looking for specifically at TJ Maxx.\"\n\nShe said TJ Maxx does \"a great job of importing global design,\" which creates a modern organic look that appears to be collected and curated from around the world.\n\n\"I think they do a really good job with their selection of baskets and the little containers that organize your drawers and your kitchen cabinets,\" she said.\n\nMaldonado said that whether you're shopping for a full-length mirror or a large canvas print, TJ Maxx is one place where you might score a better deal than other retailers.\n\n\"You can usually get something that's much larger than you're going to find for the same price at Target or Walmart,\" she said.\n\nMaldonado disputed the notion that all of the furniture seen at TJ Maxx are \"dupes\" of more expensive brands. She said she's seen pieces from high-end furniture brands like Four Hands at the retailer.\n\n\"I think, more recently, people started understanding they're not dupes, they're the original product just at a much greater price,\" she said.\n\n\"A few years ago, I bought some outdoor chairs from Marshalls [which shares a parent company with TJ Maxx] that would've been $1,000 at any other retail site, and they were $299,\" Maldonado continued.\n\n\"A 50-inch by 60-inch blanket at Target's going to be around $39.99, and it's just going to be a Target blanket,\" Maldonado said.\n\n\"But TJ Maxx will have Tahari or Tommy Hilfiger, something that's a higher caliber of materials and pattern, and it's probably going to be like $19.99 or $29.99,\" she continued.\n\n\"If you're going to spend money on a plaid blanket that you're only going to have out for a few months in the winter, I love TJ Maxx and Marshalls because you're going to save at least 30%, and it's a higher brand quality.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story was first published in December 2023.

    "fullText": "2025 brought a wave of TV premieres and returning series — but critics were more impressed by certain shows than by others.\n\nHere's a look at some of the most popular shows of the year, ranked from worst to best by critic scores on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nSummary: A group of high-powered divorce attorneys — Allura Grant (Kim Kardashian), Liberty Ronson (Naomi Watts), and Emerald Greene (Niecy Nash) — leave their male-dominated law firm to lead one of their own.\n\nCritics universally panned Ryan Murphy's \"All's Fair,\" saying it was a limp drama that wasted the talents of its ensemble, which included Sarah Paulson and Glenn Close.\n\n\"Let's be clear: 'All's Fair' is not a camp classic. For a show to be camp, it must first aspire to be good to begin with,\" David Mack wrote for Slate.\n\nSummary: Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, invites chefs, actors, and TV personalities into her home to cook and garden alongside her as they chat and exchange life advice.\n\n\"With Love, Meghan\" was a tough watch for critics, who failed to find anything sincere in the lifestyle programming.\n\n\"It's so boring, so contrived, so effortfully whimsical that, do you know what? In the end, it does become almost fascinating,\" Lucy Mangan wrote for the Guardian.\n\nSummary: In the latest installment in Netflix's \"Monster\" series, the show follows grave robber and suspected serial killer Ed Gein (Charlie Hunnam) as he commits horrific crimes in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nThe latest \"Monster\" season was criticized for sensationalizing one of the 20th century's most disturbing criminals for shock value instead of offering viewers anything profound.\n\n\"The series sensationalizes rumor over truth and mistakes provocation for substance,\" M.N. Miller wrote for FandomWire.\n\nSummary: After an explosion results in a mass prison breakout, former FBI profiler Bex Henderson (Melissa Roxburgh) is brought back into the fold to hunt down the nation's most dangerous serial killers.\n\nAccording to critics, \"The Hunting Party\" was riddled with tedious plot twists and repetitive storylines.\n\n\"The premise of 'The Hunting Party' — searching for serial killers whose ill-advised treatments have rendered them even more vicious — is intriguing in theory, but the writers have somehow chosen the dullest possible execution of that vision,\" Max Gao wrote for AV Club.\n\nSummary: After decades of judging reality competition shows and famously helping to form groups like One Direction and Fifth Harmony, Cowell tries to find \"the next big thing\" in music.\n\nCritics said \"Simon Cowell: The Next Act\" was mired by the British personality's ego.\n\n\"In the end, the series is more interesting not as a music competition, but as a window into Cowell's narcissism and immorality in the pursuit of limitless wealth and fame,\" Stephanie Morgan wrote for Common Sense Media.\n\nSummary: Set in the Old West, this drama follows two matriarchs, Fiona Nolan (Lena Headey) and Constance Van Ness (Gillian Anderson), as they fight over land and power in the town of Angel's Ridge.\n\nDespite Anderson and Headey's best efforts, \"The Abandons\" proved to be a rather empty and listless Western at its heart.\n\nNick Schager described the series as a \" … pretender through and through, piling on clichés without any sense of authenticity, rhythm, or originality\" in a review for The Daily Beast.\n\nSummary: After the alarming murder of a Homeland Security officer, LAPD detective Mark Meachum (Jensen Ackles) is recruited to a secret task force to investigate the crime.\n\nAlthough the show was advertised as an \"action-packed\" thrill ride, critics said they were less than impressed by the generic drama.\n\n\"'Countdown' pretty much uses every action procedural cliche to piece together a plot and cast of characters that are neither exciting or interesting,\" Joel Keller wrote for Decider.\n\nSummary: After their latest advertising campaign goes awry, two Gen-X ad executives — Monica (Graham) and Doug (Nico Santos) — are pushed out of their office, and their rising Gen Z colleagues are put in charge.\n\nDespite Graham's reliably solid performance, which helped ground the show, critics said it wasn't enough to save the lackluster Tubi comedy.\n\n\"Making a comedy series where everyone is unpleasant, cruel, or despicable isn't easy … If you miss, you can only miss big,\" Tim Stevens wrote for The Spool.\n\nSummary: After a prison-transport plane crashes down near his Alaskan town, US Marshal Frank Remnick (Jason Clarke) attempts to hunt down every convict before they slip out of his grasp.\n\nDespite Clarke at the helm and a promising plot hook, \"The Last Frontier\" proved to be a disappointment for a majority of critics.\n\n\"'The Last Frontier' begins and ends on a high, but the middle crashes down to earth with slow, lumbering diversions that waste its cast and squander an incredible premise,\" David Opie wrote for Empire magazine.\n\nSummary: Marissa (Snook) and Peter (Jake Lacy) Irvine's comfortable life is shaken to its core after their son goes missing.\n\nSome of the twists in \"All Her Fault\" were harder to swallow than others, but overall, critics found it to be a highly bingeable drama.\n\n\"Despite the increasingly convoluted ways that characters in 'All Her Fault' mete out information, the emotional core of the series is extremely strong, bolstered by Snook's reliably excellent central performance,\" Nina Starner wrote for Looper.\n\nSummary: Joanne (Kristen Bell) and Noah (Adam Brody) test the mettle of their relationship after the \"honeymoon\" phase as they continue navigating the everyday realities of modern dating, religion, and family drama.\n\nAlthough the show's critic score took a slight dip from season one, Brody and Bell's chemistry was enough for critics to recommend the show.\n\n\"Kristen Bell and Adam Brody continue to capture our hearts and every episode is an entertaining watch because of this fantastic ensemble,\" said critic Lauren Veneziani of WBAL-TV.\n\nSummary: After they're given a two-month window to turn their restaurant around, Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) tries to streamline the kitchen's chaotic environment as Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) and Sydney (Ayo Edebiri) attempt to earn a Michelin star.\n\nCritics said that the latest installment of the show was at its best when the pacing was relentless, and the ensemble was given their chance to shine.\n\n\"It has its slow boil moments, but when it is really cooking, it is entertainment at its best,\" wrote critic Jackie K. Cooper.\n\nSummary: Two decades after leaving her hometown in Alabama, Desiree (Laverne Cox) — a proud trans woman — reunites with her father, Harry (George Wallace).\n\n\"Clean Slate\", which is one of the last shows that legendary TV creator Norman Lear produced before he died in 2023, was received as a wholesome and heartfelt comedy.\n\n\"In the face of ongoing attacks against the trans community, it was refreshing to watch a story about a black trans woman who found acceptance in a place that might not appear to be accepting at first glance,\" Alise Chaffins wrote for MacGuffin or Meaning.\n\nSummary: This historical drama depicts the weaving paths of United States President James Garfield (Michael Shannon) and Charles J. Guiteau (Matthew Macfadyen), the assassin who took his life.\n\nCritics called \"Death by Lightning\" a masterclass in excellent writing and acting.\n\n\"A savvy and well-paced political thunderstorm, 'Death by Lightning' uses its talented cast to build a thrilling story out of an oft-forgotten moment in history,\" Audrey Fox wrote for Looper.\n\nSummary: As a new head of Hollywood's Continental Studios, Matt Remick (Seth Rogen) tries to massage celebrity egos while pursuing his dream of making movies that are actually good.\n\nCritics found it hard to resist the likability and charm of the Apple TV comedy created by Rogen and Evan Goldberg.\n\n\"Rogen and Goldberg here create satire of a very high level... And despite all the mocking and in-jokes and references to titles you may or may not remember, there's something else that peeks through: a genuine love for movies,\" Moira MacDonald wrote for Seattle Times.\n\nSummary: After unraveling the dark secrets at the heart of the Lumon corporation, Mark (Adam Scott) and Helly (Britt Lower) — and their \"outer\" selves — find different ways of moving forward from the scandal.\n\nCritics said season two of \"Severance\" built upon the momentum of the first while laying a strong foundation for the third.\n\n\"Now that 'Severance' has started to prod at these more existential questions about the self —well, it's only made the show richer and, quite frankly, more loveable,\" Clarisse Loughrey wrote for Flicks.\n\nSummary: Hour-by-hour, \"The Pitt\" chronicles the harrowing day in the life of Dr. Robby (Noah Wyle) and his team of emergency room staff as they work a 15-hour shift.\n\nWith standout performances from Wyle, Katherine LaNasa, Taylor Dearden, Supriya Ganesh, and more, \"The Pitt\" proved itself to be one of the most electrifying dramas of the year.\n\n\"'The Pitt' stands out entirely independently, separate from its pseudo-ancestor in 'ER' and as a bonafide triumph in storytelling, chemistry and television,\" Brian Farvour wrote for The Playlist.\n\nSummary: Philadelphia FBI agent Tom Brandis (Mark Ruffalo) takes charge of a task force investigating a wave of brutal robberies at stash houses linked to outlaw motorcycle gangs.\n\nBrimming with suspense, \"Task\" kept critics on the edge of their seats.\n\n\"Mark Ruffalo is at his best, and Tom Pelphrey stands out as a conflicted and occasionally menacing character. These two stories collide in one of the more compelling and engaging shows of the year,\" said reviewer Austin Burke.\n\nSummary: Hockey rivals Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie) and Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) develop complicated romantic feelings for each other that they keep secret for years.\n\nBased on the books by Rachel Reid, \"Heated Rivalry\" was praised by critics for its balance of wholesome vulnerability, queer joy, and steamy sex scenes.\n\n\"The sexual candor, hot bodies and steamy action are the main attraction. Duh. But what sneaks up on you is the sweetness with which 'Heated Rivalry' captures a transitional time in gay men's lives, a time that can be terrifying or freeing, isolating or joyfully communal — or sometimes all those things at once,\" David Rooney wrote for The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nSummary: Depressed author Carol Sturka (Rhea Seehorn) reluctantly takes on the mantle of Earth's savior as she attempts to save the planet from an alien virus\n\nAfter wowing critics with \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Better Call Saul,\" Vince Gilligan continued his legacy as one of television's most original showrunners with the success of \"Pluribus.\"\n\n\"Rhea Seehorn's brilliant tour de force as a lone resistor to hive mentality makes this potent provocation from Vince Gilligan one you don't want to miss,\" wrote critic Peter Travers for The Travers Take.",

    "description": "As a frequent Disney World visitor and travel planner, there are things I always pack to survive park days, such as ponchos, plus some I never bring.",
    "fullText": "After going to Disney World over 40 times, I've gotten really good at visiting the parks — especially when it comes to optimizing the space in my suitcase.\n\nI'm also a travel planner at Marvelous Mouse Travels specializing in Disney destinations, so my clients often ask me about the most important items to pack for a trip to the parks.\n\nRead on for the essentials I always bring, as well as the things I think you can leave at home.\n\nIf you've spent any time in the Orlando area, you know it will likely rain during your Disney trip.\n\nDon't let that stop you from having fun — just throw on rain ponchos and hit the parks. It's often much cheaper to buy them before you leave rather than inside Disney World.\n\nYou can also wear ponchos if you don't want to get wet on rides like Splash Mountain and Kali River Rapids.\n\nI've tried out every kind of bag you can imagine when visiting the parks. Ultimately, my biggest advice is to bring something small that fits your main essentials.\n\nMy husband's favorite is a cross-body bag, and I love a small backpack, purse, or fanny pack.\n\nYou want something that's easy to take on and off quickly, compact enough to take on rides, and roomy enough that you're not cramming your phone and necessities in.\n\nWhen you head to the parks, you want to travel light, so I like having smaller versions of essentials to carry.\n\nI raid the travel section of my local store before every trip to make sure I have sunscreen, hand sanitizer, aloe-vera gel, sanitizing wipes, a mini first-aid kit, pain relievers, and tissues.\n\nIt's not a Disney trip without the quintessential Mickey or Minnie ears. At this point, I have plenty to choose from based on different seasons, holidays, and moods.\n\nI also pack some of my many Disney T-shirts — one for each day at the parks. We always get one special matching family shirt for each trip, as well.\n\nThis way, we can stay on theme without feeling tempted to spend money on more merchandise while in the parks.\n\nA lot of planning in the parks requires the use of the My Disney Experience app, which is crucial for tasks like checking maps or making dining reservations. Plus, we love snapping lots of photos.\n\nVisiting Disney involves a lot of walking — on many days in the parks, I log over 10 miles. Also, because of frequent rain and water rides, my shoes often get wet.\n\nSo, I bring comfortable, fast-drying shoes to ensure my experience isn't ruined by blisters or sore feet. My husband always wears his Keen sandals, and I switch between my Sanuks and Tevas.\n\nMy family has made it a tradition to send a letter or postcard to someone back home from inside the parks.\n\nYou can always bring souvenir postcards to the front desk of your resort. However, it's more fun to put it in one of the four mailboxes on Main Street USA at Magic Kingdom.\n\nYou can pay for almost everything at Disney World with Disney gift cards, including dining, merchandise, and resort charges.\n\nMany external retailers offer small discounts when you purchase these cards, so buying them ahead of time is a great way to save a little money on your vacation.\n\nTo curb excess spending, we give each of our kids a gift card at the beginning of the trip for souvenirs. Once they use up their card's balance, they're done spending.\n\nAside from Victoria and Albert's at the Grand Floridian Resort, none of the Disney dining locations really expect more than casual dress.\n\nI love this aspect of Disney World because it means there are wonderful dining options with upscale-feeling food that are still super family-friendly.\n\nMy husband and I usually throw one nicer casual outfit in our suitcase if we decide we want to get a little fancy. But, generally, our dress clothes get left in the closet at home.\n\nMy clients often ask me if they need to bring life jackets or towels for their children to enjoy the hotel pools. Fortunately, the answer is no.\n\nAll the Disney resorts provide these items, so you can save space in your suitcase and leave them at home.\n\nIt's nice to have a few quick snacks on hand in the hotel room or in your park bag, but don't waste space in your suitcase. You can have groceries delivered to your Disney resort.\n\nMost national delivery services are available, or Garden Grocer is a local option. These deliveries can be picked up in the lobby at no charge or sent straight to your room for a small fee.\n\nThis story was originally published in January 2022 and most recently updated on December 29, 2025.",

At the time, the company's CFO, Yoshimitsu Goto, said its decision to divest had \"nothing to do with Nvidia itself\" but was a way to reallocate its funds toward OpenAI.\n\nGoto said it plans to make the final part of its $30 billion investment in OpenAI by the end of the year.\n\nThe DigitalBridge deal also aligns with SoftBank's growing focus on what it calls \"physical AI,\" as the company ramps up investments in the real-world infrastructure — from data centers to robotics — needed to integrate AI into everyday life.",

    "fullText": "Star heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua was injured in a car crash in Nigeria that resulted in two fatalities.\n\nLocal police said Joshua sustained minor injuries in the crash Monday and was being taken to a hospital, per BBC. While the exact nature of Joshua's injuries are not known at this time, \"early indications are he is OK,\" one of Joshua's representatives told ESPN.\n\nEddie Hearn, Joshua's promoter, echoed that same sentiment to the Daily Mail, although he said he was still trying to get in touch with the boxer.\n\nJoshua was reportedly traveling in an SUV that collided with a stationary truck. Olusegun Ogungbemide, a spokesperson for the Federal Road Safety Corps, said the initial investigation indicated the vehicle in which Joshua was seated appeared \"to be traveling beyond the legally prescribed speed limit on the corridor, lost control during an overtaking maneuver and crashed into a stationary truck well packed by the side of the road,\" per the Associated Press.\n\nJoshua, 36, is reportedly in Nigeria on vacation. Both of his parents were born in Nigeria and Joshua spent a few years of his childhood in the country.\n\nThe crash comes days after Joshua defeated Jake Paul in an eight-round Netflix heavyweight boxing match. Joshua knocked out Paul in the sixth round, breaking Paul's jaw in the process.\n\nPaul sent prayers to Joshua and the individuals killed in the crash Monday.\n\nLife is much more important than boxing. I am praying for the lost lives, AJ and anyone impacted by today’s unfortunate accident.\n\n— Jake Paul (@jakepaul) December 29, 2025",

    "title": "'Onyx Storm' left readers with lots of unanswered questions. Here's everything Rebecca Yarros has said about the 4th 'Empyrean' book so far.",
    "description": "Rebecca Yarros released \"Onyx Storm\" in January 2025, but readers are already looking forward to the next book in the \"Fourth Wing\" universe.",
    "fullText": "It's been nearly a year since Rebecca Yarros released \"Onyx Storm,\" and fans are growing increasingly desperate for dragon rider Violet Sorrengail's story to continue.\n\n\"Onyx Storm\" was the third book in Yarros' \"Empyrean\" series, following \"Fourth Wing\" and \"Iron Flame.\" It centers on Violet's journey to become a dragon rider and fight forces of dark magic at Basgiath War College. The series is set to have five novels when it is complete, all of which will be published by Entangled's fantasy imprint, Red Tower.\n\n\"Onyx Storm\" — the fastest-selling adult novel released in 20 years, according to The New York Times — ended on a cliffhanger, so Yarros' readers have been clamoring to get their hands on the next romantasy novel in the series since the moment they finished book three.\n\nYarros has yet to start writing the next \"Empyrean\" novel, but she has offered clues about book four.\n\nThe rest of this article has spoilers for the \"Empyrean\" series.\n\nYarros released the first three books in the \"Empyrean\" series in under two years. \"Fourth Wing\" came out in April 2023, \"Iron Flame\" was released in October 2023, and \"Onyx Storm\" hit shelves in January 2025.\n\nFans shouldn't expect Yarros to write the next series installment at the same pace. Speaking at an engagement in Philadelphia on January 25, 2025, Yarros said she wouldn't commit to a release date for the fourth \"Empyrean\" novel, as she was writing a contemporary novel first.\n\nShe also said she planned to take time off to be with her family before she writes the fourth book.\n\nYarros also told Elle that she intended to rest before returning to writing because the amount of work she did in recent years wasn't good for her mentally or physically, as she has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and POTS.\n\nYarros stayed true to her word, sharing photos of herself on vacation with her family on Instagram in the months after \"Onyx Storm\" was released. Then, in June 2025, she shared that she had started writing her next contemporary novel. She also shared a photo of the office in her new home, which has a large portrait of a scene from \"Fourth Wing\" and a fireplace with dragon sculptures built into it.\n\nOn December 8, 2025, Yarros provided another update on the status of the fourth \"Empyrean\" novel in an Instagram post, saying that the novel was next in her queue after she finishes the contemporary book she is writing.\n\n\"For transparency's sake… I'm currently working on a contracted contemporary, and once I'm done, I'll be living in the Empyrean world,\" she wrote in the caption of her post. \"I can't wait for you guys to see what I have in store for you!\"\n\nMany fans are finding it particularly difficult to wait for the next \"Empyrean\" novel because of the ending of \"Onyx Storm.\"\n\nAt the end of the book, Xaden used more of his venin power, giving into the dark side of his transition; another unnamed dragon rider turned venin; Andarna returned to Violet after her time away with the irids; and Violet woke up with a wedding ring and blessing of her marriage to Xaden from the goddess Dunne with no memory of the last 12 hours of her life. In the book's final line, her fellow rider Imogen reveals she used her signet power to wipe Violet's memory of the night — at her request.\n\nViolet's brother, Brennan, also revealed that six dragon eggs and four riders, including Xaden and his best friend, Garrick Tavis, are missing.\n\nHopefully, the fourth book in the \"Empyrean\" series will reveal what happened between Violet and Xaden, where Xaden and the other missing riders are, the location of the missing eggs, what Andarna learned from her time with the irids, and how Xaden's additional use of his venin powers harmed his soul.\n\nLikewise, Violet will likely still be searching for a cure to turning venin to bring Xaden back, but as his wife, she also becomes the Duchess of Tyrrendor. She will have new power and responsibility in his absence, and readers will have to wait to see how she balances her new role while developing her signets.\n\nYarros went on an \"Onyx Storm\" book tour after the book was released in January 2025, offering some insight into the future of the series as she connected with fans.\n\nFor instance, at an event in Los Angeles on January 21, 2025, Yarros said, \"Someone you love won't make it in book four.\" That comment isn't that surprising, as beloved characters have died in each installment of the series. However, Yarros got more specific with her hints as her book tour continued.\n\nAt an event in St. Louis on January 31, 2025, Yarros shared that readers have more to discover about the isles Violet explores in \"Onyx Storm.\" When host Lexi Ryan asked her why there was no map of the isles included in \"Onyx Storm,\" Yarros said it \"was deemed to be too spoilery\" by her editorial team, suggesting Violet doesn't know all she will about the isles by the end of book three.\n\nThen, speaking at an event in Denver on February 2, 2025, Yarros shared clues about who Xaden's new venin brother could be.\n\n\"I would pay attention to who's missing at the end,\" she said. \"I would pay attention to someone who feels like whatever they have given is not enough, which is always the case when you turn venin.\"\n\nFans think Xaden's cousin Bodhi Durran, Garrick, or even Violet's brother Brennan could fit that description at the end of \"Onyx Storm.\"\n\nYarros also discussed a plot device she uses that may have consequences for the series. After riders bond a dragon at threshing at Basgiath, the rider announces the dragon's name to the Scribes so it can be recorded. However, Yarros pointed out to fans that the dragons never speak their name to the Scribes directly. It's possible some riders don't share their real names or that dragons lie to their riders, which could help the children of rebels bond dragons their relatives previously bonded, giving them second signet powers. The potential for faux dragon identities could also have other ramifications for the series.\n\nSpeaking more on signet powers in Denver, Yarros said readers had only seen \"like 10%\" of Violet's dream-walking abilities, in part because others who developed the power would have been killed, making it difficult for Violet to learn how to use the signet.\n\n\"There's probably one person alive that can train her,\" Yarros said, though she gave no information about who that person is.\n\nShe also said Xaden's inntinnsic signet has only reached \"like 50%\" of its potential, so his abilities will likely grow in book four.\n\nIn addition, Yarros revealed at the Los Angeles Festival of Books in April 2025 that she has a title picked out for the fourth book, though she didn't say what it was.\n\nOn October 24, 2025, Yarros appeared at Romantasy Bookcon in Orlando, hosted by Fabled Fantasy Events. She spoke with the hosts of the \"Fantasy Fangirls\" podcast, Lexi Ayala and Nicole Holleman, about the \"Empyrean\" series, and Yarros offered hints and sneak peeks at book four.\n\nFor instance, Yarros discussed how the dramatic ending of \"Onyx Storm\" will impact the next book, telling Ayala and Holleman that readers will know what happened to Violet during her 12 missing hours by the novel's end.\n\nLikewise, when the duo asked Yarros about a scene she was excited to write in the next \"Empyrean\" novel, she said, \"I'm really excited to write the moment Violet realizes why Xaden married her. That I am pumped for.\"\n\nOf course, Xaden loves Violet, but considering he had turned venin and the marriage would give Violet political power as the Duchess of Tyrrendor, there is likely more to their union than meets the eye.\n\nYarros also warned that readers \"should really be prepared in book four to see Xaden enter his villain era,\" indicating his marriage to Violet won't stop him from going full venin in the next \"Empyrean\" novel.\n\nThe \"Fantasy Fangirls\" also asked Yarros if Imogen had been wiping Violet's memories at other times in the \"Empyrean\" series, which many readers had been wondering after the ending of \"Onyx Storm.\" Rather than giving a direct answer, Yarros said, \"I think it depends on what you believe of Imogen's character. What has Imogen shown you of her character? What has she told Violet about her signet?\"\n\nIn the \"Empyrean\" series, readers only see Imogen wipe memories when Violet or Xaden specifically ask her to do so. However, much of the series is only told from Violet's limited perspective, so there may have been occasions when Imogen wiped people's memories without Violet's knowledge.\n\nLikewise, Yarros addressed some of her readers' concerns surrounding Bodhi, as there is a contingent of \"Empyrean\" fans who think Xaden's cousin has feelings for Violet, saying, \"Bodhi has a thing for what Xaden has. But he doesn't want to.\"\n\nHer response indicates that Bodhi may be jealous of Xaden rather than in love with Violet. And considering he is one of the potential candidates to have turned venin at the end of \"Onyx Storm,\" Yarros' response is particularly eyebrow-raising.\n\nYarros also gave some hints about the structure of the next book, telling Ayala and Holleman that she plans to offer multiple points of view in the narration of book four. She even specified that some portion of the book will be told from Sloane Mairi's perspective.\n\nFinally, Yarros told readers to pay attention to the black dragons in the \"Empyrean\" series, encouraging them to ask themselves why there are so few black dragons in the world, adding that it's \"very relevant\" that two new baby black dragons hatched in \"Iron Flame.\"\n\nIt will still be a while until the next \"Empyrean\" book is published, but hopefully Yarros' clues can tide readers over while they wait. In the meantime, they can read other romantasy novels to make the wait a bit more bearable.",

    "description": "Legendary investor Warren Buffett, 95, is set to step down as the CEO of Berkshire Hathway at the end of the year.",
    "fullText": "Berkshire Hathaway is gearing up for the biggest leadership shake-up in decades, and one strategist thinks it presents the perfect time to buy the stock.\n\nBarbara Goodstein, a managing partner at R360, an invitation-only investment and networking group for ultra-high-net-worth individuals, told CNBC on Monday that longtime Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett's impending departure offered a \"lot of opportunity\" for investors.\n\nBuffett, 95, is set to step down as the CEO of Berkshire at the end of 2025 after nearly 60 years in the role. He will be replaced by Greg Abel, who heads the firm's non-insurance businesses and will stay on as its chairman.\n\nGoodstein said the change did not make Berkshire stock any less attractive.\n\n\"We are strong into Berkshire Hathaway, we've always respected their moves,\" she said, adding: \"We're calling this a 'succession discount.'\"\n\n\"We think the stock is trading below what it will become because everybody is waiting to see how Greg Abel performs.\"\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's stock price is up nearly 11% this year.\n\nGoodstein pointed to Berkshire's cash pile as particularly intriguing, saying she believed the firm had been \"sitting on it\" to allow Abel to make a \"big move in 2026.\"\n\nIn the third quarter, Berkshire grew its cash pile to a new record of more than $350 billion, or $382 billion if payables for Treasury purchases were excluded. The company also reported a 34% year-on-year increase in operating income to $13.5 billion.\n\nUnder Abel's leadership, Goodstein added that she thought Berkshire may look to invest in energy or defense.\n\n\"Berkshire Hathaway is well-positioned. They've always been looking at the trends. And we think that those are the two sectors that have lots of upside.\"\n\nBuffett announced his decision to step down as chief executive in May, during the closing moments of his company's annual meeting in Omaha.\n\nIn a letter to shareholders in November, Buffett addressed the looming changes and heaped praise on Abel, calling him a \"great manager, a tireless worker and an honest communicator.\"\n\n\"I can't think of a CEO, a management consultant, an academic, a member of government — you name it — that I would select over Greg to handle your savings and mine,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "That paycheck has a lot of zeros in it.\n\nPilots’ paychecks vary depending on the airline they work for and the hours they’ve flown in a given year.\n\nAccording to an American Airlines captain’s paystub that was shared on X, pilots’ earning potential is so high, it’ll cause most people to rethink their career paths.\n\nSupposedly, the screenshotted paystub was of a Miami-based American Airlines Boeing 737 captain. If you look closely, you can see that the pilot’s yearly salary is a jaw-dropping $458,000.\n\nPart of the reason this pilot probably earns as much as they do is because of their high hourly wage, around $360, which isn’t even the highest tier for pilots.\n\nCaptains of planes as massive as Boeing 777 or Airbus A350 can earn up to $450 per hour. Considering the average pilot flies around 900 hours per year, 75 hours per month, according to Flying, do the math — and that’s one fat paycheck they earn.\n\nA Miami-based American Airlines Boeing 737 captain has posted their salary pay statement on reddit, leaving many people speechless. \n\nThe pilot’s total year to date compensation was $458K, with the hourly pay being $360+ (flight hours only).\n\nSome comments suggest the pilot isn’t… pic.twitter.com/3yH1Z5zB1s\n\n— Breaking Aviation News & Videos (@aviationbrk) December 23, 2025\n\nBefore you think pilots can fly an infinite number of hours to earn a higher salary, their hours are limited by federal regulations.\n\nOther factors like rest between flights, hours spent doing pre-and post-flight duties, and if a pilot has seniority with a particular airline are also taken into account when determining the number of hours they are allowed to fly, as explained by Flying.\n\nWhen the paystub was shared to X by Breaking Aviation News & Videos, commenters couldn’t believe their eyes, with many agreeing that pilots should be paid as much as they are, considering the magnitude of their job.\n\n“I am absolutely fine with the bloke who’s in charge of the machine that is holding me 35k ft in the air being paid a lot of money,” wrote one flyer.\n\n“Go get your pilot license kids,” joked a commenter.\n\n“When your life rides in the hands of someone, you want the most capable person at the wheel. I love that captains get paid well, and that they have the training and expertise to keep the skies safe,” chimed in someone else.\n\nYet, others claimed they don’t envy what pilots have to deal with, despite the high earnings.\n\n“Still couldn’t pay me $500k to deal with horrible schedules, airports, the general public, constant hotel stays, union BS, delays etc etc etc. I abhor every aspect of commercial air travel. Sounds like a horrible existence,” quipped someone else.",

    "description": "Silver prices rose as high as $84 an ounce as talk of an arbitrage play on China's pure-play silver fund gained traction on social media.",
    "fullText": "It's been a wild few weeks for silver.\n\nThe precious metal was already on a record-breaking run this year, and recently got a further boost from speculative interest among Chinese retail investors.\n\nThe price of the metal climbed to a new all-time high of $84 an ounce on Monday before erasing gains and trading lower.\n\nSilver, which is a key component in data centers and is seen as an under-the-radar AI play, has been piquing the interest of investors all year.\n\nBut speculative buying in China started just a couple of weeks ago, when a string of posts on the social media platform Xiaohongshu outlined how investors could start an arbitrage play on the UBS SDIC Silver Futures Fund, China's pure-play silver fund. (Arbitrage is a strategy that enables a trader to capitalize on the price difference of the same asset across different markets.)\n\nThat strategy evidently gained traction. In the past week, the fund was valued at over a 60% premium compared to the value of its assets, and at one point, was up 187% from levels at the start of the year, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nThis spike in Chinese interest can be seen in the spread between spot silver prices in Shanghai and in London, which briefly rose to more than $8 an ounce on Monday, the largest premium the metal has ever posted in China, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nOn Friday, UBS SDIC said it would shutter subscriptions to the fund's Class C shares, which are preferred among short-term traders. It also advised traders to avoid chasing \"unsustainable\" gains, and said rules around trading would become tighter.\n\nUBS SDIC did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider.\n\nIt looks like there's a large number of speculators in net-short positions in silver, said Jeff de Graaf, a technical analyst and the CEO of Renaissance Macro.\n\n\"Net-short positions are negatively correlated to forward returns implying a potential short squeeze of speculators in silver markets,\" he wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nIt isn't the first time silver has been the object of investor speculation. In October, silver futures hit a fresh record in London as traders staged a short squeeze on the metal, pushing its price to its first record high in over forty years.",

    "fullText": "America has never had as many billionaires as it does now.\n\nBut how does the wealth of historic figures, such as the industrialists of the Gilded Age, compare to that of the richest people in 2025?\n\nIn many historic calculations of net worth, individual fortunes weren't measured in isolation; instead, they were compared to the GDP of the US at the time. When the US economy was much smaller than it is today, the wealthiest families and individuals carried more weight in the economy than others during more prosperous times.\n\nOne of the richest Americans of all time is widely considered to be Standard Oil founder John D. Rockefeller, whose wealth, at its peak in 1937, was equal to 1.5% of the country's GDP. His estimated net worth would be around $499 billion today, when adjusted for inflation.\n\nElon Musk's current wealth, however, is understood to have now eclipsed that of Rockefeller's. On December 29, Forbes estimated Musk's fortune to be $744.6 billion.\n\nTo identify some of the richest Americans of all time, we consulted Forbes' 2007 list of history's wealthiest figures, based on estimates by economist Peter Bernstein. It calculated individuals' wealth at their peak and compared it to the country's GDP at the time to convert it to 2006 dollars. This was then adjusted to today's dollars using the US Bureau of Labor Statistics' inflation calculator.\n\nFor living individuals, we cited estimated net worths as reported by Forbes on December 29.\n\nWhile estimations of historic wealth may not be perfect, they help paint a picture of the level of wealth enjoyed by some of America's most notable figures in business, and put it into context with today's billionaires.\n\nHere are 28 of the wealthiest Americans in history.\n\nEstimated net worth (2025 adjusted estimate): $82.5 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Banker and industrialist; heir to the Mellon banking dynasty\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $88.8 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Automaker; founder of Ford Motor Company\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $95.1 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Railroad financier and speculator\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $95.8 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Retail entrepreneur; founder of Walmart\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $98.2 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Retail magnate; founder of Marshall Field & Company\n\nSource of wealth: Tech entrepreneur; co-founder of Microsoft\n\nSource of wealth: Financial data entrepreneur; founder of Bloomberg LP\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $118 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Timber magnate; founder of Weyerhaeuser\n\nSource of wealth: Walmart heir and board member\n\nSource of wealth: Walmart heir and former chairman\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $132.1 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Retail pioneer; founder of AT Stewart & Co.\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $134.5 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Banker and industrial investor; heir to Mellon banking dynasty\n\nSource of wealth: Tech entrepreneur; founder and CEO of Dell Technologies\n\nSource of wealth: Investor; CEO of Berkshire Hathaway\n\nSource of wealth: Tech executive; former CEO of Microsoft\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $156.3 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Banker, merchant, and financier\n\nSource of wealth: Co-founder and CEO of Nvidia\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $180 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Fur trader and real-estate investor\n\nSource of wealth: Tech entrepreneur; co-founder of Facebook, now Meta\n\nSource of wealth: Tech entrepreneur; co-founder of Google\n\nSource of wealth: E-commerce entrepreneur; founder of Amazon\n\nSource of wealth: Software entrepreneur; co-founder and former CEO of Oracle\n\nSource of wealth: Tech entrepreneur; co-founder of Google\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $275.3 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Shipping and railroad tycoon\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $459.6 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Steel industrialist; founder of Carnegie Steel\n\nNet worth (adjusted estimate): $499 billion\n\nSource of wealth: Oil magnate; founder of Standard Oil\n\nSource of wealth: Tech entrepreneur; CEO of Tesla & SpaceX",

    "title": "The real obstacle to AI in creative agencies isn't tech — it's fear, a consultant says",
    "description": "AI strategist Jules Love says agencies must rethink training, culture, and pricing to help creative teams thrive, not just work faster, in the AI era.",
    "fullText": "AI is transforming how creative work gets made — but most agencies still don't know where to begin in using it.\n\nJules Love, founder of Spark AI, a consultancy that helps creative firms weave AI into their day-to-day work, says the real challenge isn't technical — it's psychological.\n\n\"Adopting AI in your team won't happen by accident,\" he told Business Insider. \"You need to do it deliberately — make somebody accountable for it, and give them the space to be successful in that role.\"\n\nDrawing on his work with more than 60 agencies through Spark AI, he shares six ways leaders can future-proof their teams for the AI era.\n\nLove says most agencies won't transform unless someone owns the AI integration work.\n\nRather than setting up vague \"innovation groups,\" he encourages leaders to assign responsibility and protect time for AI integration, even if that means pulling people slightly away from billable client work.\n\nAgencies that succeed, he added, treat AI as a core business priority, not a side project that gets squeezed in when deadlines allow.\n\n\"It's amazing how many agencies roll out ChatGPT or Gemini to their teams and don't train anybody on it,\" Love said.\n\nHe likens untrained teams to people staring at a giant box of Lego with thousands of bricks inside, but no picture on the front and no instructions. The picture on the box, he said, is role-specific training.\n\nFor him, training is what turns experimentation into practical capability.\n\nLove said agencies struggle to innovate when teams are constantly under deadline pressure.\n\nTo make real progress with AI, leaders need to create structured time for experimentation — moments where people can test new workflows without the risk of missing a client delivery.\n\nHe pointed to companies like Lego, which regularly takes teams off-site to explore new ideas, and Canva, which paused normal work for a full week to rethink how departments could use AI.\n\n\"Fear kills innovation faster than bad tools,\" Love said. \"You have to give a little bit of room for failure.\"\n\nLove said a lack of openness around AI use is one of the clearest signs that something is wrong.\n\nWhen employees feel the need to hide tools like ChatGPT from coworkers, it suggests AI is still seen as risky or illegitimate rather than useful.\n\nTo change that dynamic, he advises leaders to make AI use visible and normalized, especially by creating space for teams to share how they're experimenting — including what hasn't worked.\n\n\"That's the No. 1 sign that there's not a good culture around AI in your business.\"\n\nHe also encouraged managers to push responsibility down the organization by giving individuals ownership over specific AI initiatives, such as maintaining a prompt library or developing custom tools, so adoption feels collaborative rather than imposed.\n\nLove said many creatives misunderstand how AI is meant to be used. Too often, teams treat it like a faster search engine — asking one-off questions and moving on — rather than as a collaborative assistant that improves with context and iteration.\n\nHe argues that real gains come when people learn to \"brief \"AI the way they would a colleague, giving it background, constraints, and feedback instead of quick prompts.\n\n\"It's much better to think of it as briefing somebody else to do the job,\" Love said.\n\nLove said agencies risk undermining their own value if they focus only on how AI makes work faster.\n\nAs creative output accelerates, clinging to the billable hour can push firms toward commoditization rather than differentiation, he said.\n\nInstead, he urged leaders to rethink pricing around outcomes, rather than speed, and to pilot AI in specific workflows so that teams can clearly measure what improves.\n\n\"If all we're doing is doing more stuff faster, then we're going to see a bit of a race to the bottom on fees,\" Love said.\n\nHe believes that fixed-cost projects, which reward better results — not velocity — give agencies room to invest in learning and experimentation without eroding their margins.\n\nLove's advice for 2026 is simple: \"Stop thinking about what you can do today more quickly and what you can do tomorrow better.\"\n\nHe believes the agencies that thrive will not be those with the biggest budgets or flashiest tech but those that help their people learn, lead, and experiment.\n\n\"Come 2027, you're going to be looking pretty old-fashioned, pretty expensive, and pretty uninteresting as an agency if you're not embracing this stuff and seeing what you can do with it,\" he said.",

    "title": "Saving for a down payment is getting easier. Here are 8 markets where it takes under 5 years.",
    "description": "The time it takes to save for a down payment came down from its peak of 12 years in 2022. But, it's still about double what it was just six years ago.",
    "fullText": "Coming up with a down payment is often one of the biggest hurdles for homebuyers. The good news for homebuyers is that the time it takes to save for a down payment has decreased in recent years. The bad news is that the median down payment is still about double what it was before the pandemic.\n\nIt took the typical household seven years to save for a down payment in 2025, down from a peak of 12 years in 2022, according to an analysis from Realtor.com. The analysis assumes households save 5.1% of their income — the 2025 national average savings rate — toward a down payment.\n\nHowever, with home prices steadily increasing in several cities around the country, the amount required for a competitive down payment is also up.\n\n\"Higher home prices and intensified competition have pushed typical down payments higher, at the same time that inflation and rising household expenses have reduced savings rates,\" Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, said. \"Although conditions have improved since 2022, today's timeline shows that saving for a home takes meaningfully longer than it did before the pandemic, especially in high-cost markets.\"\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, the average buyer paid about $13,900 for a down payment. In the third quarter of 2025, buyers paid $30,400, according to Realtor.com.\n\nIn larger metropolitan areas with extremely high home prices, it will obviously take longer to save for a down payment. According to Realtor.com, the San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont, California, housing market has the longest wait for a down payment at 36.5 years.\n\n\"In high-cost markets, the typical down payment alone exceeds a full year of household income,\" Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com, said. \"That reality makes homeownership feel unattainable for many buyers, particularly younger households trying to enter the market for the first time.\"\n\nLuckily, there are still affordable markets where it takes less than seven years to save for a down payment. Here are eight of the largest US housing markets with the shortest time to save for a down payment.\n\nMedian household income: $73,941\n\nMedian household income: $73,107\n\nMedian household income: $80,673\n\nMedian household income: $73,644\n\nMedian household income: $83,452\n\nMedian household income: $67,785\n\nMedian household income: $84,890\n\nMedian household income: $77,385",

    "title": "Timothée Chalamet's stunt-filled 'Marty Supreme' marketing campaign proves we like stars who hustle",
    "description": "The \"Marty Supreme\" marketing campaign was successful because we could appreciate Timothée Chalamet's hustle, says a Hollywood executive.",
    "fullText": "When Timothée Chalamet sported a giant ping pong ball on his head in a handheld-shot video shared on his socials in October, it was clear the \"Marty Supreme\" marketing campaign was going to be different.\n\nSince then, we've seen an orange blimp in the sky, pop-up shops selling the trendy jackets brandishing the movie's title, and Chalamet standing atop the Las Vegas Sphere.\n\nIt all led to A24's most expensive movie ever, blowing past industry expectations for its opening weekend at the box office with over $27 million since Christmas Day.\n\nWhat the \"Marty Supreme\" promotion has taught Hollywood is that movie marketing works, as long as you don't do typical movie marketing. And moviegoers don't even need to know what the movie is about before going to see it. (Be honest: All you knew was that Chalamet was playing ping pong.)\n\nFor decades, the playbook for releasing a movie has been along these lines: release an eye-catching trailer, develop a bunch of ads with critics and fanatics praising the movie, and have the stars do some interviews with major outlets and late-night shows. Sure, \"Marty Supreme\" did this, but that's not what got audiences into theaters.\n\nThe \"Marty Supreme\" campaign worked because we could see how hard Chalamet wanted us to notice him, so we did. Whether it was him doing the \"Crank That\" dance in Brazil, hosting a table tennis tournament, or sitting alongside comic Druski on the latest episode of Coulda Been Records auditions, the star wasn't just game to do it all; it felt like he was channelling a part of himself into ambitious marketing elements.\n\n\"If you can feel the labor, you become drawn to it,\" Jackie Brenneman, president and CEO of Attend Theatrical Marketplace, told Business Insider.\n\nThe whole thing oozed an authenticity that left audiences not just entertained, but feeling it was their obligation to see the experience through by buying a movie ticket.\n\n\"It feels authentic. It feels — instead of A24 telling Chalamet how to market it, it's Chalamet's own brand of weirdness,\" she continued. \"And that's endearing. At a point, you say, 'That's my Christmas movie. That's what I'm going to see because look at how much fun he's having!\"\n\n\"People are going to 'Marty Supreme' so they can feel the version of themselves that gets it,\" Brenneman said. \"They get to look around the room and go, 'Yeah, you get it, too.' And that's really powerful.\"\n\n\"Marty Supreme\" already had dedicated cinephiles hooked, thanks to the movie being made by acclaimed indie studio A24 and the writer-director being Josh Safdie, one half of the brother team that gave us arguably Adam Sandler's greatest dramatic performance with \"Uncut Gems.\"\n\nBut with A24 dishing out around $70 million to make \"Marty Supreme,\" the largest budget ever for one of its movies, the studio needed its biggest splash yet to recoup. Film data analyst Stephen Follows says A24 achieved this by executing a \"marketing-as-performance\" campaign.\n\n\"Movie marketing is shifting from promotion to participation, particularly for original, star-driven projects that don't have the built-in awareness of existing IP,\" Follows told Business Insider.\n\nBoth Brenneman and Follows believe this type of marketing can be replicated, but there's one element on which they disagree: the need for a star.\n\n\"It will be most viable for star-driven original movies where the star has enough cultural gravity to carry the event marketing,\" Follows said.\n\nHowever, Brenneman believes you can create a similar movement without a Chalamet-level star being involved.\n\n\"If you have an independent movie, you can release it in 20 cities, work with theaters in advance, and eventize it — surprise pop-ups, work with the most popular restaurants in those towns that match the vibe of your movie, make that community know that if they like this place, they will like your movie,\" she said. \"It is absolutely 100% not only replicable but also necessary.\"\n\nRegardless of how you approach it, it still requires effort. And for A24, that long rally paid off.\n\n\"Marty Supreme\" is playing in theaters nationwide.",

    "title": "Gen Z is talking openly about sobriety — and the stories are darker than you think",
    "description": "They’re sober, in their 20s and sharing it all — hospital stays, blackouts and rehab — online.",
    "fullText": "\"I'm either going to get sober or die.” This was the startling realization Parker Schley came to after his battle with alcoholism reached what he describes as the point of no return. “I couldn’t continue like that,” Schley, 26, tells Yahoo. “I was asking to die, basically.”\n\nSchley, who works as an assistant property manager in Virginia, represents a growing number of Gen Z-ers (born between 1997 and 2012) who are openly discussing their relationship with alcohol and their journeys to sobriety online. A quick search of \"sobriety in your 20s\" on TikTok yields thousands upon thousands of videos of people talking candidly about giving up drinking alcohol at a young age. The public-facing nature of this phenomenon stands in stark contrast to the narratives portraying Gen Z as teetotaler totalitarians.\n\nSure, Gen Z is drinking less than previous generations, but they are still susceptible to the perils of addiction, notes Daniel Siconolfi, a behavioral and social scientist at RAND whose research includes the sober-curious movement and social challenges like Dry January.\n\n\"Gen Z is drinking less in young adulthood than millennials (born between 1981and 1996) or Gen X ( born between 1965 and 1980) did. In fact, 20% to 30% of Gen Z adults don't drink at all,\" Siconolfi says. \"That said, young adults in their 20s still have the highest rates of risky drinking and are the least likely to receive treatment compared to other age groups.”\n\nThis reluctance to seek help is largely due to the shame and judgment surrounding sobriety and rehab. But with the help of social media, many Gen Z-ers are pushing back against these stigmas. From recurring ER visits to frat party crashouts, these young creators are coming clean about their rocky relationships with alcohol, for all the world to see.\n\n\"I was waking up at the hospital with complete alcohol poisoning — unconscious, shallow breathing and my lips turning blue,\" Schley says of one particularly pivotal night out during his senior year of college at the University of New Hampshire. But he brushed off his hospital stay as a one-off — not a warning sign.\n\nOn his page, Schley details experiences like this and traces back to the start of his drinking issues. He says he was always aware of the dangers of alcohol but was naive to how it could, and would, affect him. \"I thought that was for other people to worry about. That wasn't going to happen to me,\" he says.\n\nBut as soon as those first few sips of chilled raspberry Smirnoff passed his lips at a high school homecoming party during his freshman year, Schley was hooked.\n\n\"I fell in love with alcohol the very first time,\" says Schley, adding that drinking helped him silence the noise that plagued him as a closeted gay man. \"Alcohol took away the stress from that. When I was drinking it was easier to be me.”\n\nLike many of his Gen Z peers, Schley, who got sober in February, was blessed with the gift of digital gab and has no qualms about sharing the raw, vulnerable realities of his sobriety journey with his 87K TikTok followers. The decision to share online might seem scary at first, but Schley says that being able to use his platform to help others has been life-changing.\n\n\"I got a message from someone's dad that was like, 'I used to blame myself so much for not being there for my son, and you helped me realize that he wasn't ready to accept that he had an issue, and there wasn't much that I could have done to save him from his struggles with alcohol,'\" Schley says. \"That was a really cool message to get, because my relationship with my dad was about to be done before I went to rehab, so to be able to have helped not only the kid that's going through it but someone in his family as well is the biggest gift I could ever ask for.”\n\nSiconolfi agrees that there are real benefits to sharing these stories online. \"Social media can be a powerful space for information, connection and social support, whether someone is just reassessing their relationship with alcohol or seeking treatment for alcohol-use disorder,\" he says.\n\nAlkhuzama Zaini, a 24-year-old college student living in Virginia, says posting about going sober helps keep her accountable. Like Schley, Zaini's relationship with alcohol started pretty early. \"My junior year of high school, I was 15, and there was a big football game and my friends and I pregamed,” she tells Yahoo. “I ended up getting alcohol poisoning at the game, and the ambulance had to come.” The consequences of this infraction were swift: Zaini was suspended from school for five days, which also caused a rift between her and her family.\n\n\"My family is from Saudi Arabia, and I come from a Muslim family, so it was a big deal within my culture and my religion,\" she says. Still, she continued to drink, and her relationship with alcohol only soured further when she went to college.\n\nOne night, Zaini got so drunk that she blacked out and had to be told what had happened by her friends.\n\n\"Apparently, I got so drunk I threw up on this frat guy's lap, and he had to drive me home and the dorm RA had to call 911,\" says Zaini. This hazy night landed her in the hospital, where she recalls having significant trouble breathing and throwing up acid.\n\nBut she still wasn’t ready to give up booze. \"The next day after I got out of the hospital, I was drinking at a football tailgate. I guess I took it as a joke. But it wasn't,\" says Zaini. It wasn't until her personal relationships with friends and family members started to fracture that she decided to go to rehab this past summer.\n\n\"I knew I wanted to go to rehab because it was either get sober or death for me,\" says Zaini, adding that she was flunking out of school and hiding the extent of her drinking from those closest to her. \"I was drinking full handles [half-gallons] a day, hiding the bottles and lying about it. Now I'm just so grateful that we're all still good friends now.” She’s back on track at school too and will be graduating in 2026.\n\nFor many people, sobriety is a lifetime commitment. But in some cases, it can be a temporary change to help reevaluate existing behaviors with alcohol. This approach is a less-intimidating avenue for some Gen Z-ers who have more apprehensions regarding full-on sobriety.\n\nEmily Gleason, 27, is one of them. She grew up seeing unhealthy relationships with alcohol throughout her entire childhood and early adolescence, which made her hesitant to drink at all. Even when she started drinking occasionally, she was always hyper-aware of the negative ways in which it impacted her.\n\n\"Most weekends I would go out with my friends, party, all the things that most college people do. But even then, I knew I really didn't like the way I'd feel when I was hungover or the things I'd do or say when I was drunk,\" Gleason tells Yahoo.\n\nIt wasn't until 2020, when the pandemic forced her to move back in with her parents, that she had to reconcile with the behaviors that shaped her relationship with drinking.\n\n\"That was the household in which the alcoholism was prevalent in my childhood, and it still is prevalent,” Gleason says. “Seeing it as an adult, it was like I had to confront that, and that's when I started to look at drinking as a question in my life.” This questioning is something Gleason is still playing around with. She currently still drinks occasionally, but she did have a period of sobriety for about a year.\n\n\"Now I've matured to a point where I have a very healthy boundary and relationship with alcohol, where I don't need to be 100% sober,” she says. “But alcohol is definitely not a big part of my life at all.”",

    "description": "Joanna Gaines' one-pot spinach-tortellini soup is one of my new staple recipes. The meal is hearty, easy to cook, and uses ingredients I already have.",
    "fullText": "The star of the soup is definitely cheese tortellini — one of my favorite items to keep on-hand in the pantry or freezer all winter long.\n\nThe other ingredients include unsalted butter, onion, minced garlic, chicken broth, fire-roasted tomatoes, Italian seasoning, cannellini beans, baby spinach, fresh parsley, fresh basil, salt and black pepper, lemon, and shaved Parmesan cheese to top it off.\n\nThe first step is to melt the unsalted butter over medium-to-high heat in a large soup pot. I typically favor my Le Creuset or Lodge Cast Iron Dutch oven.\n\nOnce the butter is melted, I add the diced onion and minced garlic. I stir constantly to prevent the garlic from burning, waiting until the onion becomes soft and translucent.\n\nI add the chicken broth, fire-roasted tomatoes, and Italian seasoning to the pot and bring the mixture to a rolling boil.\n\nOnce that's done, I add the tortellini and cannellini beans to the pot as well, allowing the soup to boil until the pasta is fully cooked.\n\nFor this batch, I used Andrea cheese tortellini, which takes roughly eight to 12 minutes to cook, but timing may vary depending on the brand you choose.\n\nI also love to use Trader Joe's spinach tortellini for a little twist.\n\nIn preparation for the final step — tossing in the green vegetables — I turn the heat down to medium.\n\nThen, I add the spinach, parsley, and basil, and season the soup with some salt and pepper to taste.\n\nI continue stirring until the spinach is wilted, which takes just a few minutes. Then, I squeeze some fresh lemon juice into the broth and give it a final stir. The added citrus is a total game changer.\n\nThe most exciting part of the recipe is digging into the fruits of my labor.\n\nI like to ladle the soup into bowls and add some leftover, sliced lemon for a garnish and extra aesthetically pleasing touch.\n\nGaines usually tops her soup with fresh Parmesan cheese and pairs it with a side of crunchy French bread — perfect for dipping.\n\nHowever, I'm a major fan of baking a homemade rosemary olive-oil loaf each week, especially when soup is on my mind. So, I enjoy pairing this recipe with sliced homemade bread or a sandwich for a classic combo meal.",

    "title": "Lightspeed Ventures partner says Sora will make social media creators 'far, far, far less valuable'",
    "description": "Lightspeed Ventures partner Michael Mignano predicted that AI-generated video would lead to the \"end of the creator.\"",
    "fullText": "AI-generated video is here. What will happen to your TikTok feed?\n\nOpenAI's launch of Sora 2 sent shockwaves through the social media economy. AI slop was already rampant, and now there was a more realistic form of video with even narrower tailoring. Then came the lifelike images of Google's Nano Banana.\n\nHow will creators fare in the age of AI? Lightspeed Ventures partner Michael Mignano takes a more extreme view: that it signals the \"end of the creator.\"\n\nOn \"Sourcery,\" Mignano described a future of social media where content is generated instantaneously and artificially to best suit the viewer. It comes down to keeping the user's attention, he said.\n\n\"That's why the TikTok algorithm is so powerful,\" Mignano said. \"But it still requires human beings to make the content, and there's a cost to that.\"\n\nThat \"cost\" is the human labor and payments that go into creating your feed. AI could mean costs go down, but that spells bad news for the influencer.\n\n\"The individual creator becomes far, far, far less valuable in that dynamic,\" he said.\n\nMignano is well-versed in the online media space. He was VP of product at Aviary, a photo editing tool that was acquired by Adobe. He then cofounded and ran the podcasting platform Anchor, which was acquired by Spotify.\n\nAt Lightspeed Ventures, Mignano also invested in Elon Musk's xAI. The investment was made in 2024, before xAI acquired X, formerly Twitter.\n\nMignano acknowledged that the \"death of the creator\" — as he called it on his Substack — was \"devastating,\" but that it marked a \"whole new chapter for the internet.\"\n\nAI-generated video hasn't yet reached the point of on-demand, perfectly tailored content. Some users are perturbed by its current iteration, and TikTok allows users to choose whether to keep AI-generated videos out of their feed.\n\nBut some of the change is already here. AI influencers have emerged on Instagram, and TikTok Shop is inundated with AI scams. That cute video of bunnies bouncing on a trampoline? Yeah, that was AI.\n\nWe may not need perfect AI tailoring to reach an inhuman internet. Industry leaders, including Alexis Ohanian and Sam Altman, have referenced the \"dead internet theory,\" which says that there is more bot activity than human activity on the web.\n\nMeanwhile, the era of the social media megastar may be on the decline. Reed Duchscher, Mr. Beast's former manager, told Business Insider that it's now easier to build internet businesses with \"hyper-niche\" audiences.\n\nHow can creators stay afloat? In an email to Business Insider, Mignano wrote that quality will win out.\n\n\"Platforms will no longer reward humans posting the same old, tried and true formats and memes,\" he wrote. \"Instead, true uniqueness of image, likeness, and creativity will be the only viable path for human-created content.\"\n\nCorrection: December 29, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated Michael Mignano's title at Aviary. He was the VP of product.",

    "description": "Salary data shows how much Uber pays corporate tech workers in 2025, with jobs earning up to $410,000. See which roles earn the most.",
    "fullText": "Uber is hiring people as it tries to become a \"super app.\" So how much is it paying them?\n\nYou're probably familiar with the millions of gig workers who drive you to the airport or deliver your food. Now, Uber is looking to expand those services — with self-driving cars, for example — as well as offer customers targeted offers.\n\n\"We're slowly moving towards a super app of sorts,\" CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said.\n\nSome of the people whom Uber has hired as it tries to make that vision a reality have come from outside the US via H-1B visas.\n\nCompanies are required to submit this work visa data, which includes salary information, to the US Department of Labor for all foreign hires. However, the compensation figures don't include equity or other benefits that employees can receive in addition to their base pay. The filings also include industry average pay rates for US workers.\n\nThe process for obtaining an H-1B visa, however, is changing.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump instituted a $100,000 fee for the visa. And proposed changes to H-1B visa rules would tilt the already competitive visa lottery in favor of the highest-paid applicants, lawyers told Business Insider.\n\nUber filed to hire 945 workers through the H-1B visa program during the 2025 federal fiscal year, which ended on September 30, according to filings with the US Department of Labor. That's more than the 778 filings that Uber made during 2024.\n\nHere's a look at the jobs that Uber disclosed salaries for:\n\nStaff Software Engineer: $225,200 to $258,800\n\nManager, Engineering: $231,700 to $287,000\n\nManager, Applications Development: $195,600 to $210,500\n\nSenior Manager: $234,100 to $299,700\n\nStaff Software Engineer, TLM: $242,000 to $249,300\n\nSenior Director, Engineering: $360,000 to $410,000\n\nScientist, Tech: $111,966 to $176,400\n\nSenior Scientist, Tech: $151,700 to $207,200\n\nSenior Applied Scientist: $186,307 to $208,062\n\nStaff Scientist, Tech: $219,100 to $250,000\n\nApplied Scientist: $133,100 to $179,100\n\nData Scientist: $125,950 to $153,700\n\nData Scientist, Tech: $129,750 to $160,700\n\nData Scientist III: $150,000 to $175,019\n\nData Analyst: $156,600 to $161,000\n\nData Analyst, Tech: $116,750 to $162,200\n\nSenior Data Scientist: $150,400 to $164,300\n\nProduct Manager: $158,700 to $197,000\n\nSenior Technical Program Manager: $202,500 to $231,400\n\nSenior Program Manager: $144,500 to $170,100\n\nBusiness Analyst - Operations II: $110,075 to $117,554\n\nScientist, Tech: $149,650 to $174,900\n\nSenior Scientist, Tech: $169,800 to $185,300\n\nSenior Operations and Logistics Manager: $135,600 to $142,850\n\nRegional Operations Manager: $101,300 to $140,950\n\nManager, Sales Operations: $157,400 to $166,900\n\nManager, Central Operations: $157,100 to $161,900\n\nSenior Program Manager: $143,000 to $178,800\n\nStrategic Operations Manager: $111,900 to $166,600\n\nMachine Learning Engineer: $178,900 to $198,500\n\nSenior Machine Learning Engineer: $219,900 to $235,500\n\nSoftware Engineer: $98,516 to $198,500\n\nSoftware Engineer II: $113,308 to $135,005\n\nSoftware Engineer III: $131,003 to $188,084\n\nStaff Software Engineer: $207,800 to $273,000\n\nStaff Software Engineer, TLM: $246,400 to $263,000\n\nSenior Staff Engineer: $260,400 to $312,700\n\nSenior Software Engineer: $151,819 to $242,000\n\nStaff Applications Developer: $225,100 to $251,100\n\nSenior Applications Developer: $179,500 to $209,700\n\nManager, Technical Accounting: $164,600 to $166,900\n\nManager, Strategy and Planning: $155,000 to $173,600\n\nSenior Manager, Strategic Finance: $192,300 to $206,000\n\nManager, Central Operations: $140,900 to $160,200\n\nProduct Designer: $157,100 to $174,600\n\nBusiness Insider has been collecting pay data for tech companies.

    "title": "I went to Hawaii for the first time. My trip would've been better if I'd known these 5 things before I left.",
    "description": "Though I planned a lot for my first trip to Hawaii, I would've saved time and money in Oahu if I'd known these tips and how to avoid some mistakes.",
    "fullText": "Recently, I went on a nine-day trip to Oahu that included a stay at Disney's Aulani Resort in Ko Olina.\n\nBecause this was my first time visiting Hawaii, I tried to do as much research as possible before my trip. But after arriving, I still wished I'd known a few things.\n\nBefore leaving for Oahu, I'd heard from friends and read on social-media groups that getting around could be difficult. My fears of sitting in traffic for the whole week set in before I even stepped foot off the plane.\n\nIn reality, my family and I never got stuck in gridlocked traffic over our six days on the island.\n\nA hotel worker we met said that, no matter which part of the island you are on, the big secret to avoiding traffic is to head out after 9 a.m. and try to make your way back either before 3 p.m. or after 6 p.m.\n\nMy family and I followed this rule every day of our trip and never had much traffic to deal with while we traveled from Ko Olina to Pearl Harbor and from Ko Olina to the North Shore.\n\nWe also found the drivers to be much more courteous than we're used to back in Florida. No one weaved in and out of the cars around us.\n\nOne of the most talked about spots on Oahu is Leonard's Bakery, known for its Portuguese-style doughnuts named malasadas.\n\nThe main store is near Honolulu, which was about a 40-minute drive from where we were staying. I'd pretty much accepted that we'd have to budget a few hours one day to try the sugary treats.\n\nBut once we landed on Oahu, we noticed a Leonard's Bakery food truck — lovingly named Malasadamobiles — about 10 minutes from the resort.\n\nThe truck dished out hot malasadas to order, but it didn't offer the main bakery's extended menu. That was the only real trade-off for us, but it was worth it to save on driving time.\n\nMy packing list for Hawaii was long, but one of the most important items was sunscreen. Hawaii is close to the equator, so the UV rays are even stronger on the islands.\n\nHowever, I wished I'd known more about the islands' rules around reef-safe sunscreen before I started packing.\n\nHawaii has banned the sale of sunscreens with the chemicals oxybenzone and octinoxate, which can be harmful to the local reefs — and some counties allow only mineral-based sunscreens.\n\nI ended up using Sun Bum sunscreen throughout my stay, and now that I know more, I'll continue to use it in Florida to help protect coral reefs.\n\nThe weather can be drastically different around Oahu. For instance, when my family left Ko Olina on the western side of the island to drive to the North Shore, the sun was out, and it was very warm.\n\nAbout an hour into our drive, we passed by Kualoa Ranch (a filming location for \"Jurassic Park\"), and it was suddenly cooler and cloudy.\n\nOnce we got to the North Shore, the sun was back out, and we were able to enjoy our day of beach hopping.\n\nKnowing some key sayings and phrases in a native language goes a long way with locals, no matter where you're traveling. I knew some basic Hawaiian words — such as \"aloha\" (hello) and \"mahalo\" (thank you) — but I wish I'd learned a few more.\n\nWhile I was there, I learned a new phrase that came in handy: \"a hui hou,\" which means \"until we meet again.\"\n\nWe stayed in some spots for a few days, so it was nice to say that to the people we'd connected with on our way out.\n\nThis story was originally published on April 30, 2024, and most recently updated on December 29, 2025.",

    "title": "Meet Lululemon founder Chip Wilson, who just launched a proxy fight to shake up the athleisure giant's board",
    "description": "Chip Wilson founded Lululemon in 1997 after selling his first apparel company. He became known for his controversial remarks and mishandling of company scandals.",
    "fullText": "Lululemon's billionaire founder, Chip Wilson, has been the center of both acclaim and controversy.\n\nThe 70-year-old entrepreneur was at the forefront of the movement that turned women's activewear into everyday apparel. The booming athleisure market is estimated to reach $623 billion by 2030, according to a November 2025 report. And Lululemon is a big part of that market. Popular items, like the brand's leggings, develop cult followings and become status symbols among certain demographics, like Gen Z.\n\nBut Wilson has also been a poster child for corporate controversy. Over the years, his comments about women's bodies, child labor, and the Asian community sparked outrage and eventually led to his ouster.\n\nAfter being heavily involved with the brand for over 15 years, Wilson resigned from the board of directors in 2015. Despite his exit, he's been vocal about the company's performance in recent years, frequently calling it out for underperforming compared to newer competitors. In December, he launched a proxy fight by nominating three new independent board members.\n\nToday, Wilson is worth about $7.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and is often among the top 10 wealthiest Canadians. He spends part of his fortune on philanthropy and researching a cure for the rare muscular disease called facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, which he was diagnosed with at 32 years old.\n\nHere's everything we know about Wilson's life and career as the founder and former CEO of Lululemon.\n\nWilson lived in California up until the age of five when his family moved to Calgary. He relocated to Edmonton for university in 1973 before moving back to the US for work two years later, according to his website.\n\nHe lived in Alaska and worked on an oil pipeline in 1975. During this time, Wilson said he read the top 100 books of all time.\n\n\"By the age of 19, I might have been the wealthiest, most traveled and best-read boy in the world,\" Wilson wrote on his website.\n\nHe went on to become an economist after receiving his degree in economics from the University of Calgary in 1979.\n\nHis entrepreneurial streak began in 1979 with Westbeach Surf Company. He started making shorts inspired by those he saw on a trip to California in 1979, Wilson writes in his book, \"The Story of Lululemon.\"\n\n\"The mistake that led to my success was an inability to sell my long, baggy, wild-patterned shorts to wholesalers. Consequently, I was forced to open my own store,\" he writes on his website.\n\nHe opened his own stores and owned the manufacturing — a move that he said tripled profits, he writes\n\nOver the years, his company evolved to serve different types of athletic lifestyles, like skateboarding and snowboarding. In 1997, Wilson sold Westbeach.\n\nWilson led an active lifestyle growing up. He played football, wrestled in university, and completed an Ironman triathlon in 1983, according to his website.\n\nFour years later, he was diagnosed with the rare, slow atrophying muscular dystrophy. As a result Wilson said he dedicates \"considerable time and money into discovering a cure.\"\n\nThe first Lululemon store opened in 2000 in Vancouver, Forbes reported. Wilson is often credited with creating and normalizing athleisure for everyday wear rather than just for workouts.\n\nWilson once said he named the company Lululemon because he believed Japanese people can't pronounce the letter L.\n\n\"It's funny to watch them try and say it,\" Wilson told Canada's The Tyee in 2005.\n\nHe has also said that brand names with the letter L in them are considered more authentic to Japanese consumers.\n\nHis now-wife, Summer Wilson, started as the founding lead designer for the brand, according to her website.\n\nWilson and Summer wed in 2002, according to his site. He had two sons from a previous marriage, and he and Summer eventually welcomed three more.\n\nThe couple live in Vancouver where Wilson has permanently lived since 1986, per his website.\n\nAfter taking the company public, Wilson took the role of chief innovation and branding officer. His CEO successor was former Starbucks executive Christine Day. The pair clashed often.\n\nIn January 2012, Lululemon announced that Wilson would step down from his role as chief innovation and branding officer. His vision for the brand's direction was a source of friction between him and former CEO Day.\n\nFollowing his resignation, Wilson began a sabbatical in Australia for over a year before Lululemon called him back to help handle a crisis, according to a 2015 press release.\n\nWomen, children, and minorities have been the subject of Wilson's most offensive takes over the years. Most of which he's had to later clarify or apologize for.\n\nThe lululemon founder once blamed birth control for higher divorce rates since \"Men did not know how to relate to the new female.\" Wilson has also spoken in favor of children working in factories to earn money and avoid poverty.\n\n\"The single easiest way to spread wealth around the world is to have poor countries pull themselves out of poverty,\" Wilson told The Tyee.\n\nAmid tension with Day and a year of scandals for Lululemon, Wilson stepped down from his role as chairman of the board in 2013.\n\nIn his book, titled \"Little Black Stretchy Pants,\" Wilson said he made Day cry during a 2013 meeting when he called her a terrible CEO and questioned her vision for Lululemon. Wilson wrote that he suspected her reaction was fake, and Day announced her resignation one day later.\n\nOn his website, Wilson said he had his own reason for leaving the company.\n\n\"I lost control of the culture and product development,\" Wilson wrote. \"At odds with a board of directors who did not want to invest in the future, I departed in 2013.\"\n\nIn the deal, Wilson sold half of his shares in the company to investment firm Advent International for $845 million, Inc. reported. Today, Wilson owns an 8% stake in Lululemon, according to Bloomberg.\n\nIn 2019, Wilson invested $100 million in the Chinese activewear company for a 0.6% stake, Forbes reported. Anta owns a majority stake in Amer Sports, a conglomerate of brands which includes Arc'teryx and Wilson Sports. Wilson said in an interview that he owns a 20% stake in Amer.\n\nWilson's 8% stake in Lululemon makes up a major portion of his wealth, per Bloomberg. Lululemon reported revenue of $10.6 billion in the last fiscal year, which ended in February 2025.\n\nHis waterfront mansion was valued at ​ $74 million in 2023 and has seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms, according to CBC. The property, which was constructed in 2008, has a pool and tennis court.\n\nLow Tide Properties invests in, develops, and operates commercial and residential buildings in Vancouver, with a focus on building lab and hospital spaces. It also owns multi-family properties in Seattle.\n\nWilson told Real Estate Magazine that started the company with a goal to invest 65% of his family's wealth into real estate in three cities by 2030.\n\nIn 2018, the Wilsons established the Wilson School of Design at Kwantlen Polytechnic University in Richmond, British Columbia. They donated $12 million towards the program and a $36 million new facility on the school's campus.\n\nHe has allocated some of his wealth towards his charities Imagine1Day, which funds schooling for children in Ethiopia, and Wilson 5 Foundation which supports land conservation and public art installations in British Columbia.\n\nWilson's rare muscular disease affects an estimated 900,000 people globally. Wilson has an even less common form known as FSHD2, which affects just 5% of those with the disease, Business Insider reported.\n\nIn 2022, Wilson created his philanthropic venture Solve FSHD and pledged $100 million into finding a cure for FSHD.\n\nOn his website, Wilson wrote, \"I have a great fascination for the subject of longevity as I see aging as a disease.\"\n\nIn his quest to cure FSHD, he has experimented with longevity and wellness treatments popular among wealthy entrepreneurs trying to prevent aging. Some of his methods include hormone therapy, electroacupuncture, and daily doses of the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin, according to Bloomberg.\n\nWilson told Forbes in an interview published in January 2024 that he doesn't agree with the \"whole diversity and inclusion thing\" that Lululemon has embraced.\n\n\"They're trying to become like the Gap, everything to everybody. And I think the definition of a brand is that you're not everything to everybody,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"You've got to be clear that you don't want certain customers coming in,\" he added.\n\nWilson has had some choice words for Lululemon's leadership over the years as the brand loses ground to brands like Alo Yoga and Vuori. In October 2025, he compared the mistakes that the brand has made to a plane crash. He also doesn't appear to be a fan of CEO Calvin McDonald, who is set to exit the company in 2026.\n\nHe blamed the brand's \"loss of cool\" on McDonald and his team for losing its innovative edge, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nAlthough Wilson hasn't held a management position at Lululemon in over a decade, he's still voicing his strong opinions on how the company should be run. After Lululemon named CFO Meghan Frank and chief commercial officer André Maestrini as co-interim CEOs earlier in December, Wilson said the CEO succession plan was a \"total failure of board oversight.\"\n\n\"Shareholders have no faith that this board can select and support the next CEO without input from a board with stronger product experience,\" Wilson said in a public statement.\n\nOn December 29, he confirmed that he has nominated three inependent director candidates to the company's board, effectively launching a proxy fight at the athleisure brand.

    "title": "The dollar has been the weakest major currency in 2025. Here's what that means for everyday Americans.",
    "description": "The US dollar's 10% decline this  year looks bad on the surface. But there are actually some positives.",
    "fullText": "It's been a weak run for the buck.\n\nThe US dollar has declined against all of its main global peers in 2025, and the Dollar Index — which measures the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies — is down 10% this year.\n\nThere have been multiple catalysts for the decrease, none more prevalent than the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates multiple times. Generally speaking, when a central bank lowers rates, holding a currency becomes less attractive.\n\nThere's also the matter of President Trump's proposed tariff policies, which particularly roiled markets in the first half of 2025. Investors viewed his potential levies as negative for growth and a source of uncertainty, both of which were dollar-negative.\n\nBut let's not get too doom-and-gloom about a weak dollar. There are positives too.\n\nDetailed below are the two pros and two cons of a depreciating currency:\n\nA weaker US currency offers other countries more purchasing power, which can boost exports and economic growth. It can also support US industries that depend heavily on exports, like manufacturing and agriculture.\n\nThe US exported $125 billion more goods and services in the nine months leading up to September than it did the same period last year, the Census Bureau said this month, an increase of 5%.\n\nPresident Donald Trump pointed out the benefits of a weaker dollar when speaking to the press in July, suggesting that the US could \"make a hell of a lot more money\" when the greenback was weak.\n\n\"When we have a strong dollar, one thing happens: It sounds good. But you don't do any tourism. You can't sell tractors, you can't sell trucks, you can't sell anything,\" he said at the White House.\n\n\"Pushing down the dollar's value has been a policy priority for the administration as it sought in part to make exports more attractive,\" Joseph Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM, wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nThere are also positive implications for the labor market. If export-heavy industries like manufacturing and agriculture are thriving, that can create more jobs.\n\nA boost to international sales is inherently good news for US firms that sell goods abroad. That applies to most of the S&P 500, where foreign sales are significant for at least half of the index's companies, Hogan said.\n\n\"I would say the pros and cons for corporate America are more tailwinds than headwinds,\" he added.\n\nAfter the US dollar recorded its worst first half of the year in nearly half a century, Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, said the bank believed a weaker greenback was an underappreciated \"tailwind\" from an earnings perspective.\n\n\"There's no doubt that a weaker dollar is part of the story for why revision factors have continued to move — even faster recovery than we had expected,\" he said, speaking to CNBC earlier in the year.\n\nA cheaper dollar could also be a boon for unhedged international equities, or shares of international stocks in local currencies, BlackRock said in a recent client note. That's partly because foreign firms are gaining purchasing power as their local currencies strengthen against the greenback.\n\nOn the other hand, a weaker currency in the US can translate to higher prices for US consumers of imported goods, or goods with imported parts. That adds to inflationary pressures that already hang in the background with Trump's tariffs.\n\nConsumer prices rose 2.7% year-over-year in November — below what economists expected, but still above the Fed's long-run 2% inflation target.\n\n\"For everyday Americans, the story is a bit opposite,\" Hogan said. \"The buying power of your dollar goes down as the value of the dollar goes down against the basket of other currencies. So it does make it harder to keep up with higher cost of goods.\"\n\nAmericans on vacation could also facing higher costs, as a weaker dollar has less purchasing power abroad, Hogan added.\n\nOn the flip side, it also makes the US more attractive as a tourist destination for foreigners, who have gained purchasing power.\n\n\"There's puts and takes,\" he said. \"If you're planning that European vacation, it's going to cost you a bit",

    "description": "The usual suspects like Nvidia and Broadcom are on BofA's list. But the firm is also bullish on some less popular names.",
    "fullText": "New research from Bank of America has thrown cold water on the growing narrative, and instead focuses on the upside the firm sees in chipmakers.\n\nThe firm recently laid out its forecast for the coming year in a note to clients, predicting that the AI market will experience some volatility but ultimately finish the year strong as data center buildouts continue and companies double down on manufacturing and equipment spending.\n\nThe analysts view the AI market as being roughly halfway through an eight- to 10-year evolution, for which 2026 marks the midpoint. During its second half, they expect to see tech companies continue to upgrade IT infrastructure and continue accelerating AI workloads.\n\nBofA sees a particular opportunity in large-cap companies that are also high-quality sector leaders. It highlighted six chip stocks it says are particularly well-positioned to benefit from AI-capex spending that could reach $1.2 trillion by 2030.\n\nHere are the firms top six picks in that group:\n\nNvidia: +41% year-to-date.\nBroadcom: +52% year-to-date.\nLam Research: 146% year-to-date.\nKLA Corporation: +103% year-to-date.\nAnalog Devices: +30% year-to-date. \nCadence Design Systems: +6% year-to-date.\n\nWhile Broadcom, Lam and KLA significantly outperformed Nvidia it in 2026, BofA analysts maintain that they see the dominant chipmaker as the undisputed industry leader, noting that it currently trades at half its growth rate and highlighting its promising pipeline of likely catalysts.\n\nThat said, BofA values Broadcom at 33 times its anticipated earnings for 2026, predicting that it can go as high as $500 per share in the coming year, due to its high profitability among semiconductor producers and impressive free cash flow.\n\nAnalysts see Lam Research as being in an excellent position overall, due to the equipment it produces on which chip fabs are highly dependent. While it notes that the company may be subject to some tariff and inflation-related pain, BofA still sees it as a strategic play on a key corner of the AI manufacturing market.\n\nAdditionally, BofA notes KLA's leading profit margin among chipmakers, highlighting it as one of the industry's most stable names, which it believes justifies as a higher multiple. It names Cadence Design Systems as its top pick for Electronic Design Automation, but also highlights the risk posed by trade tensions with China.\n\nWhile it acknowledge's Analog's high free cash flow, it notes the possibility of economic downturn negatively impacting the chipmaker if automotive and industrial customers scale back their high-performance chip spending.\n\nDespite these concerns, though, BofA remains highly bullish on this chip stocks as well as some of their smaller cap peers.\n\n\"We remain constructive on chip stocks heading into 2026,\" BofA says. \"While debates around the pace and profitability of AI investments will continue, we believe consensus under-appreciates the mission critical, oﬀensive and defensive nature of capex investments being done by the largest and best funded tech companies.\"",

    "title": "Miami has the most top Instagram influencers per capita in the US, beating out LA and NYC",
    "description": "Miami creators, influencers, and social media personalities are finding success as the city becomes a creative hot spot.",
    "fullText": "Los Angeles has the entertainment pedigree, but there's another city in the US that's home to even more top influencers per capita: Miami.\n\nVale and Sebastian Genta understand why. The siblings and social media personalities moved back to their hometown of Miami in 2021, after spending five years in LA. The pair, who post about their glamorous lives and occasionally offer a wry take on influencing, wondered what their move would mean for their careers. They were pleasantly surprised.\n\n\"Miami was a completely different city,\" Vale said. \"The amount of events in Miami, the amount of people that are there, brands that are present, it's almost as much as LA.\"\n\n\"Many of us know each other, so if you go to events that Gucci is throwing at the Design District, you're more than likely going to bump into five to 20 familiar faces,\" Sebastian said of the upscale fashion and design neighborhood.\n\nThe Gentas aren't alone. New research shared exclusively with Business Insider by Patrick Adler, a professor at the University of Hong Kong, reveals that Miami consistently ranks as the No. 3 metro area in the US by top Instagram creator count, after LA and New York City.\n\nMiami boasts over 6,000 top Instagram influencers. LA has roughly 12,000, and NYC nearly 11,000. (Seattle was next, with about 4,000.)\n\nAdler, who has also conducted research on the closely watched Otis Report on the Creative Economy, ranked metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) by creators in the top 10% in terms of Instagram followers, using data from an influencer marketing firm. Adler said that other platforms, such as YouTube and TikTok, showed similar trends.\n\nMiami still has a ways to go in absolute numbers to catch up with LA and NYC, long known as the centers of US media and entertainment, but it's punching way above its weight. It's only the sixth-largest market by population and the seventh-largest traditional entertainment market.\n\nLooking at the data another way, Miami actually has more top influencers per capita than LA.\n\nOther markets that regularly came up in the top 10 by this measurement are creative hot spots like Las Vegas, Atlanta, Houston, and Nashville.\n\nVictoria Bachan, an SVP at Wasserman Creators, said that for the new guard of independent creators, being in LA or NYC matters less.\n\n\"Take the biggest YouTuber in the world, MrBeast — he's in Greenville, NC,\" she said.\n\nMiami experienced a relocation boom during the COVID-19 pandemic as people, creators included, flocked to South Florida for its warm weather and lack of state or local income taxes. Creators found a growing number of events like Formula 1's Miami Grand Prix, which debuted in Miami in 2022, as well as the Miami Open tennis tournament and Art Basel Miami Beach, which offer places for them to be seen. Brands like Geico and Vuori also seek out personalities there when they want to tap into the Miami lifestyle and Latino culture.\n\nTop Miami influencers include breakout TikTok star Alix Earle, who gained social media fame while attending the University of Miami, and Xandra Pohl, a DJ and model. The scene features prominent food influencers like Samantha Schnur, known as The Naughty Fork, and Nico Norena.\n\nCities like Miami have also offered a haven for Angelenos struggling with the high cost of living in LA and early 2025 wildfires, Wasserman Creators' Bachan said.\n\n\"They're crunching the numbers, and a lot of them did pick up and move to Atlanta and Vegas and Miami,\" she said.\n\nBecca Bahrke, CEO of Illuminate Social, a creator management firm with about 85 clients, estimated that before 2020, 80% of her clients were in LA and NYC. Since then, the ratio has flipped, and her clients are now sprinkled all around the US, from Hawaii to South Carolina.\n\n\"We saw a mass exodus,\" she said.\n\nLA is still the entertainment capital in terms of population. But this new data adds to the narrative of a traditional entertainment industry in decline.\n\nLA has lost ground in traditional film and TV, with the rise of lower-cost film hubs elsewhere. A growing number of A-listers have decamped for other cities.\n\nStill, there are limitations to living in secondary markets for certain types of creators. Being in LA or NYC is considered important in the industry if you aspire to be a Hollywood actor and want to collaborate in person with other creators and attend major events.\n\n\"Our advice is if you want to make money, have an address in New York and LA,\" said Kyle Hjelmeseth, CEO of G&B Digital Management. Some managers also caution against moving outside the US, saying it can impact your ability to get brand deals.\n\nThe Genta siblings said they wish Miami had a bigger TV and film scene to help their peers who are seeking those opportunities. They started #NextGen Creators, an events series where creators can learn and mingle with brands.\n\n\"Many creators want to move on to traditional media, like hosting television, acting, whatever that may look like, and I do think Miami still lacks in that,\" Sebastian said.",

    "fullText": "Spencer Platt/Getty Images (L)/Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images (R)\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) went scorched earth on President Donald Trump in a New York Times profile on Monday, trashing the president’s claim to a Christian faith and singling out her stand on the Epstein files as what sent him over the edge.\n\nGreene, who spent years as a staunch Trump loyalist, recounted her break with the president to Times reporter Robert Draper, claiming that she was “naïve” for having been part of what she called a “toxic” political culture she said she found to be at odds with her Christian faith.\n\nHaving now found herself branded a “traitor” by the president and his most awkward Republican critic, Greene explained that her break with Trump sharpened after the September killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which she recalled as a pivotal moment.\n\nWatching Kirk’s memorial service, Greene said she was struck by the contrast between the forgiveness of Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, and Trump’s onstage remarks that, unlike Kirk, he chooses to “hate” his “opponent.”\n\n“It just shows where his heart is,” she later texted Draper, adding: “It just shows where his heart is. And that’s the difference, with her having a sincere Christian faith, and proves that he does not have any faith.”\n\nGreene told the Times the episode forced a reckoning with the brawler persona she said Trump had helped normalize and that she had participated in.\n\n“Our side has been trained by Donald Trump to never apologize and to never admit when you’re wrong,” she said. “You just keep pummeling your enemies, no matter what. And as a Christian, I don’t believe in doing that. I agree with Erika Kirk, who did the hardest thing possible and said it out loud.”\n\n“After Charlie died,” Greene told Draper on another occasion. “I realized that I’m part of this toxic culture. I really started looking at my faith. I wanted to be more like Christ.”\n\nFrom Trump’s perspective, Greene insisted, the real rupture was her stand on the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\n“It was Epstein. Epstein was everything,” she told the Times.\n\nGreene pushed to force the release of investigative material, arguing it symbolised elite impunity: “Rich, powerful elites doing horrible things and getting away with it. And the women are the victims.”\n\nThe break gave way to wider criticism of what she believed was the divergence of Trump and congressional Republicans from America First policy making, which irked fellow Republican lawmakers and resulted in the president branding her a “traitor.”\n\n“Am I going to get murdered, or one of my kids, because he’s calling me a traitor?” she said she asked herself after a pipe bomb threat and an anonymous email targeting her son.\n\nSoon after she announced she would be retiring from Congress, yet throughout she insisted that she did not change — MAGA did.\n\n“Everyone’s like, ‘She’s changed,’” Greene said to Draper. “I haven’t changed my views. But I’ve matured. I’ve developed depth.”\n\nShe added: “I’ve learned Washington, and I’ve come to understand the brokenness of the place. If none of us is learning lessons here and we can’t evolve and mature with our lessons, then what kind of people are we?”\n\nThe post Marjorie Taylor Greene Goes Scorched Earth on Trump in Splashy NYT Feature — Claims ‘He Does Not Have Any Faith’ and Her Epstein Stand Was Last Straw first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump struggled to offer much sympathy for the families of about 100 Americans—many of them U.S. military veterans—who have died fighting in Ukraine.\n\nAn estimated several thousand Americans have volunteered to fight for Ukraine since Russian dictator Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion in 2022, with at least 92 Americans killed as of September, The New York Times reported.\n\nFollowing a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday to discuss a peace deal to end the war, Trump was asked about his message to the families of the fallen Americans.\n\n“The message is so obvious,” he replied. “What a shame. They died in a foreign country. And some are celebrated people, they’re very celebrated. But it’s so sad that a thing like that would happen.”\n\nHe then immediately moved on to the next question.\n\nSocial media users quickly noted that the president hadn’t thanked the fallen for their sacrifice, praised their commitment to freedom and democracy, or even offered his personal condolences.\n\nMany of the Americans who have died in Ukraine were U.S. military veterans.\n\nMike Meoli, 71, was a retired Navy Seal and firefighter who traveled to Ukraine to train medics on the front lines. He was killed in November 2024, ABC 10 News San Diego reported.\n\nNicholas Maimer, 45, was an Army Special Forces veteran and Idaho native who helped train Ukrainian officers. He was killed in May 2023 in an artillery barrage, according to Military.com.\n\nIan Frank Tortorici, 32, was a retired corporal with the U.S. Marines who fought on the front lines. He died in July 2023 after a Russian missile hit a restaurant where he was eating while on leave, Task and Purpose reported.\n\nThe U.S. government has declined to provide aid to American fighters to avoid any suggestion of a direct clash with Russia, which is a nuclear power, the Times reported in September.\n\nBut some social media users argued that Trump’s barely-there compassion for their families wasn’t measured diplomacy—it was reminiscent of the president’s previous comments about Americans who died in combat being “suckers” and “losers.”\n\nDuring a trip to France in 2018, the president said American soldiers who died on French soil during World War I were “losers,” and that U.S. Marines who helped halt the 1918 German advance toward Paris were “suckers” for dying at the hands of the enemy.\n\nThe White House denied reports of the comments, which were revealed by The Atlantic magazine in 2020, but they’re just one example of the president disparaging military veterans and their families.\n\nHe has mocked the late Sen. John McCain’s war injuries, publicly insulted the parents of a 27-year-old soldier who died in a car bombing in Iraq, and privately raged about the funeral costs for a female soldier who was murdered by a male soldier at Fort Hood.\n\nAlthough he failed to offer much comfort Sunday to the families of Americans who have died fighting Russia, Trump did manage to heap praise on the man who started the war.\n\n“Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed,” Trump said, prompting Zelensky to raise an eyebrow. “I was explaining to the president [Zelensky], President Putin was very generous in his feeling toward Ukraine succeeding.”\n\nHe also said he “understands” Putin’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire while a longer-term agreement is being hashed out.\n\n“He feels that look, you know, they’re fighting and to stop, and if they have to start again, which is a possibility, he doesn’t want to be in that position—I understand that position,” Trump said.\n\nPutin bombarded Ukraine with over 100 drones on Christmas Eve and early Christmas Day, killing at least seven civilians.\n\nSunday’s talks were intended to address security guarantees and possible territorial concessions, and while both sides said progress had been made, neither gave any indication that a deal was within reach.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

Credit - Adek Berry—AFP/Getty Images\n\nChina launched extensive military drills near Taiwan on Monday in what it called a “stern warning” against separatist and “external interference” forces after the Trump Administration announced an $11.1 billion arms sale to the island earlier this month.\n\nThe Chinese military’s “Justice Mission 2025” exercises—the first major drills it has held around the island since April—are to include combat-readiness and port-blockade drills, complete with live fire and simulated land and sea strikes, along seven zones across the island, in part to deter outside intervention, China’s Eastern Theater Command announced.\n\nTaiwan has been self-governed since 1949, after Nationalist forces fled to the island following their defeat by Chinese Communist powers. But China has maintained that it has sovereignty over Taiwan and long called for a “reunification” between the smaller territory and the People’s Republic of China.\n\nSenior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson of the Eastern Theater Command, said the drills were a “stern warning against ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces” and described the military action as a “necessary” move to protect China’s \"sovereignty and national unity.”\n\nTaiwan’s Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said the exercises “further confirm” the Chinese Communist Party’s “nature as an aggressor and the biggest destroyer of peace.”\n\nIn the drills, China is operating dozens of aircraft and drones around the Taiwan Strait, according to the deputy chief of the general staff for intelligence for the Taiwanese Defense Ministry, Hsieh Jih-sheng. More than 100,000 travelers on international flights were set to be affected by the Chinese military’s actions, per the island’s Transport Ministry.\n\nMilitary drills are expected to continue through Tuesday, Taiwan’s Civil Aviation Administration said.\n\nThe exercises come as China has expressed ire over the recent $11.1 billion U.S. arms sale to Taiwan, which includes high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS) and harpoon missile repair related equipment. The U.S. previously approved more than $1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan in November.\n\nLast week, the Chinese foreign ministry enacted sanctions against 20 U.S. defense firms in the wake of the sales, barring companies such as Boeing from doing business with the global superpower. Ten executives for those companies were also barred from entering China or doing business in the country under the sanctions.\n\nThe State Department notified Congress that it had approved the large-scale sale to Taiwan less than two weeks ago, saying that the potential deal “serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\"\n\n“The proposed sale[s] will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance and economic progress in the region,” the department’s statement continued.\n\nTaiwan’s presidential office stated at the time that it was “sincerely grateful” for the announced sale, while China quickly condemned it, asserting that it undermined Chinese sovereignty and security and disrupted peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.",

    "description": "The owner of the house and her family have four cars, so they spill slightly onto the lawn when parked—which is where the town takes issue.",
    "fullText": "Parking in a driveway is about as mundane as parking can get. It's not as fancy as in a garage. It's not as potentially dangerous as parking on a street. And yet, in this story, it's led to a six-figure fine that the Florida Supreme Court has decided to let stand after several years of litigation.\n\nWhile the state's Supreme Court didn't endorse the fine, according to CBS News, it declined to review the case of Sandy Martinez, a single mother who has spent several years fighting fines that have now ballooned to $165,000 and counting. Over $100,000 of those fines relate directly to Ms. Martinez parking her cars on her driveway and slightly onto her grass. Her home isn't home to her alone; her son, daughter, and sister all live with her. All four of them have full-time jobs, and each of them has their own car. The house itself is on a corner lot, so street parking isn't available. As such, they line their cars up across the four-car driveway.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the four cars always ends up having to park slightly onto the grass in the yard that Martinez owns. According to the city of Lantana, that's unacceptable, and as a result it has fined her $250 a day for over a year.\n\nThe Institute for Justice has stepped in, and is representing Martinez. “Six-figure fines for parking on your own property are shocking,” IJ senior attorney Ari Bargil told CBS News, following the court’s decision not to take up the case. “The court’s refusal to hear Sandy’s case is a disservice to all Floridians.”\n\nFor Martinez, options moving forward are extremely limited. CBS News says Florida's Homestead Protection Act shields her from foreclosure, but it's destroyed the equity she'd built up in her home. She can't retry the case in Florida either, and given the Supreme Court's ruling, it's unlikely that a federal court would hear the case.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

    "title": "The Seven Best Combo Tools for Your DIY Projects",
    "description": "These tools combine several functions in one.",
    "fullText": "There are two universal truths about tools: They’re expensive, and they take up a lot of space. If you’re trying to maintain a home or perform some DIY work in a small space or on a small budget, stacking up all the tools you might need to get the job done can strain your wallet and simultaneously pose a storage challenge.\n\nThe solution is actually pretty easy: Buy tools that combine more than one function into a single item. While having the specific tool you need for every job will always be your best choice, if you lack space and/or cash, combination tools like these give you all the capability you need without eating up all your storage space—or draining your bank account.\n\nHaving a wide range of wrenches on hand means you can tackle any job—but it also means you’ve got to figure out how to store those wrenches so they don’t take over your life. Enter the universal wrench, which can be every wrench and ratchet you need. It will fit spline bolts, six- and 12-point bolts, torx, and square bolts. It also handles damaged bolts and all standard sizes.\n\nYou might already have a multitool, but that’s nothing compared to this useful combination tool. This combines 17 standard tools into one hand-sized unit, including a screwdriver, tape measure, level, flashlight, and hammer. You’re not going to be doing major renovation projects with this, but if you need a complete toolbox for everyday DIY and have no space or budget for real tools, this will get just about every job done.\n\nThis five-in-one drill from Dewalt is a terrific combination tool for two reasons: It’s multifunctional, and it combines a small size with a lot of power so it can be used in just about any situation. It comes with four attachments: an offset adapter, a quick-release bit holder, right-angle adapter, and a ratcheting chuck. You can bore holes and drive fasteners while easily changing the angle and position of your bit—the right-angle and offset attachments plus its small size means you don’t need any other drill to get your jobs done.\n\nTwo of the most useful items in a tool box are a hammer and a prybar. If you’re looking to save some space, combining the two is a great solution. The Vaughan Rage model also works as a sledgehammer/demolition tool, and offers a nail-puller as well as the prybar function, making it incredibly useful for such a small and affordable tool.\n\nHaving the right saw for the job is essential—trying to use a wood saw when a hacksaw would be a better choice is never going to work. This eight-in-one hand saw offers swappable blades for wood, drywall, metal, and plastic, allowing you to cut a wide range of materials without having to collect and swap out multiple saws. It also features a quick-change mechanism, so if you’re working with multiple materials, you can quickly switch between them.\n\nIf you’re going to fix things, you’ll need a wrench, a pair of pliers, and a screwdriver—and this tool combines them all, as well as a wire cutter and a knife. The adjustable wrench will fit most standard bolts, and it also provides multiple screwdriver bits so you’re not stuck with just the standard Phillips head. Instead of four or five tools taking up space, this one small piece will do it all for you.\n\nYou don’t have to be a professional painter to use this nifty 10-in-one tool to make your painting projects easier and your toolbox a bit lighter. This thing is a paint, caulk, and adhesive scraper, can (and bottle) opener, roller cleaner, spot hammer—it can even drive a flathead screw in a pinch if you need it to. In other words, instead of carrying a bunch of tools to deal with the usual irritations and challenges of painting a wall, you can slip this into your back pocket and get to work.",

    "title": "Use the ‘Yesterbox’ Method to Stay on Top of Your Inbox",
    "description": "Turn your never-ending to-do list into a finite one.",
    "fullText": "Inbox management, like so much else, is a necessary evil in our day-to-day lives. As such, it’s best handled with the use of a strict system, but those can be tricky to implement and stick to. Also like so much else, finding the right system is time-intensive and adds a new layer of stress onto an already annoying task. Here’s a system that’s simple, doesn’t take a lot of time to start using, and can actually help you get through your unreads without overwhelming you. It’s called “yesterbox.”\n\nThis technique—and its funny name—both come from late Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh, who described yesterbox as a way of “relieving email guilt.” The concept is simple: Today, you only deal with yesterday’s emails. It's like a slightly stricter version of the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, and while I don't always love FIFO, I recognize it has a place in a well-rounded productivity approach—and yesterbox is a great example.\n\nHsieh believed that “inbox zero” is not only an elusive goal, but a nearly impossible one. As soon as you start replying to emails, responses arrive. By its very nature, email is a form of correspondence, which means you’re sending and receiving—and for it to be effective, it has to be ongoing.\n\nThe thing is, though, that you don’t know how many emails you’ll get today. The only true, finite number you can count on is the number of emails you got yesterday, so that’s where your focus should be if you want to prevent yourself from getting caught up in the back-and-forth of immediate communication.\n\nStart by picking a time to deal with emails every day. Ideally, this should be in the morning, so nothing too urgent from yesterday slips through the cracks. Try using timeboxing to schedule your day and blocking out a dedicated time—a half an hour or so, depending on the volume of actionable emails you usually receive and how much of your work is actually done through them—for email management every morning. Hsieh was a proponent of dedicating three hours to this task, but he was the CEO of a giant company, so be realistic about how long it will actually take you. Spend some time trying different approaches to time management and to-do list creation, like the 3-3-3 list or 1-3-5 method. Figuring out how long email management should take you, as well as how much of a resource suck it actually is, will take a little effort, but those frameworks help.\n\nUse that time to only look at and respond to emails you got the previous day. Next, filter out the emails from the previous day that will require more effort from you, whether it’s a lengthy response or the inclusion of attachments. You can star them or move them to a folder, but focus first on the ones that require simple responses—or no response at all. You're more or less using the two-touch email management technique here, but specifically scheduling yourself so you're only applying it to yesterday's messages. Go through each before returning to the ones that will take some more serious effort. Once that’s done, don’t look again until the next morning.\n\nThis creates a finite to-do list that doesn’t go on all day. By looking at each day’s previous emails systematically, you won’t miss any, either. The only real exception to this rule should be urgent, day-of emails about tasks that are taking place in the moment. If you’re expecting any like that, add the sender to your priority list to make sure you get the notifications and, if possible, ask them to make the subject line something easily identifiable. Resist the urge to look at any emails related to anything else but pressing, immediate issues.",

    "title": "To Achieve Inbox Zero, Declare 'Email Amnesty'",
    "description": "When you need to clear out your inbox, but you don't want to go overboard.",
    "fullText": "The idea of declaring “email bankruptcy”—just deleting all the emails in your inbox past a certain date—is so popular, it has its own Wikipedia entry. I can see why it's tempting to just blow everything up and start over, and the temptation goes far beyond emails: Declaring a personal bankruptcy and mass-deleting games, movies, and e-books you fear you’ll never play, watch, or read is a practice with proponents far and wide (including some of us here at Lifehacker).\n\nBut declaring bankruptcy is such a drastic step. What if you tried inbox amnesty instead?\n\nThe idea for inbox amnesty comes from Lifehacker’s health editor, Beth Skwarecki, who advocates for achieving inbox zero by selecting all your emails and archiving them, instead of deleting them. “BOOM,” she says. “You have inbox zero and will do better in the future.”\n\nWhile there are tricks you can employ to manage your inbox in real time and keep the number of unread messages down (like the “one touch” rule), there will still be times when your inbox gets unruly. That doesn’t bother some people, but the ever-increasing number in the notifications badge makes others feel like they’re losing their minds. If that’s you, declare inbox amnesty and just start over.\n\nPersonally, I don't much care what the red badge on my email app says. I have maintained the same primary email address since I was in high school and have designated numerous other addresses for various needs in my life. I gave up on the idea of \"inbox zero\" long, long ago. But I still get the compulsion to go bankrupt in other spheres. A bit over a year ago, I did a major cleaning and organizing overhaul in my apartment. I began by going scorched-earth, throwing things away right and left. I came to regret that quickly, as I tossed things I ended up needing, or at least could have sold or donated. Eventually, I designated two different closets as liminal spaces where I could let things marinate while I figured out what to do with them. That was my version of amnesty, and now, months later, I've freed up enough space and time to dedicate myself to my resale business, and I'm glad I didn't just go the bankruptcy route.\n\nWhile inbox amnesty and bankruptcy both rely on the same idea—nuking all the emails and starting again, determined not to let the unreads get out of hand this time—there is one key difference: Amnesty doesn’t destroy the emails forever, it just marks them as read and tucks them away, out of sight. Just as I learned the value of keeping unwanted things around when I did my big apartment decluttering, you might learn it when you accidentally delete an email you need back in the future. Email amnesty helps you avoid learning the hard way.\n\nWith amnesty, you can go back into that archive if you need to, finding contact information or threads that you might actually need to follow up on in the future. If you go bankrupt and destroy them all, you won’t be able to refer to anything from the past—and you just know something will come up that requires you to look at an older email you no longer have.\n\nYou can set a reminder for yourself to fully delete your archived messages after six months if they don’t become necessary, but as long as they’re not clogging up too much of your storage, feel free to hold onto them in case of emergency.",

    "title": "Use the ‘OHIO’ Method to Manage Your Endless Tasks and Messages",
    "description": "The less time you waste deciding what to do, the more time you'll have to work.",
    "fullText": "When you're wading through all the emails, Slack messages, and other notifications you get on an average day, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. When that happens, you can might yourself getting distracted and missing important messages—at least, that's what happens to me, unless I have some kind of plan in place.\n\nThere are a few different approaches you can consider to prevent this, but the \"OHIO\" technique is the one to try if you need extra help being decisive—though it's important to note that while it can ease your decision paralysis, it does have a few limitations worth considering.\n\nOHIO is an acronym for “Only Handle It Once” and you'll hear it crop up in a variety of productivity-based conversations, like ones around tidying up. Proponents say it helps you avoid unnecessary dawdling, delays, and indecision, as it calls for you to handle any task, email, message, or assignment just one time. It's definitely a habit you need to build up to, but it's one that pays off the longer you work at it.\n\nYou can broadly apply it to what you’re working by assessing your entire inbox, to-do list, or other group of tasks all at once. Prioritize the tasks in order of importance using a system like the Eisenhower Matrix or ABC method. (If the workload isn’t too complex, feel free to prioritize them quickly on your own without a fancy system, but I'm a big fan of customizing hyper-specific productivity techniques to meet my needs.) Then take immediate action on each, starting from the top. Either delete them, delegate them, do what they say, or defer them, using the 4D method.\n\nThe OHIO method works great for emails, too, but it can suck you into time-wasting if you’re not careful. Only handling each email once is a solid way not to spend too much time on it, but you have to plan what you’re going to do. Otherwise, you may end up clicking every new email that comes in and trying to manage it in real time.\n\nEmails are harder to prioritize than a to-do list, so you may struggle to determine which one you should jump on first. Instead of implementing the OHIO method in the moment every moment, set aside time every morning and afternoon to go through your messages and, of course, only handle them once. (You can use time boxing and time blocking to make sure you do this at the same time every day, plus a 3-3-3 to-do list to make sure you have time to prioritize the task.) Try a half hour at the start of your workday, a half hour after lunch, and 15 minutes just before clocking out. If you base your approach on time, rather than a prioritized list, you’ll still be able to open each message and handle it, but won’t be swamped by having to do that every time you get a new alert.",

    "description": "You don't have to settle for macOS's Finder.",
    "fullText": "You can customize more on your Mac than you might have realized, and that extends to the file management software you use to browse around your system. Take, for example, Finder: There are a good number of alternatives around that bring with them extra features and different layouts.\n\nI've been testing out three of the most well-known and highly rated alternatives to Finder to see what I might be missing. Each one has its own appeal, but the third in the list here is so good that I might switch to it permanently for all my file and folder needs on macOS.\n\nAs soon as you load up Commander One, you'll notice it has a busier interface than Finder, which may or may not suit you, depending on your attitude toward minimalism. Its layout is based around a dual-pane interface, and you can customize it in a variety of ways—even down to the fonts and colors used, if you want something bespoke.\n\nThe software starts to show its potential when you move from just looking at your files and folders to actually doing something with them. You're able to rename files when copying and moving them; you get a dedicated file operations queue; and you can run complex searches through your system using regular expressions, too.\n\nI like the quick toggle switches for seeing hidden files and for previewing files without any additional apps, and connecting up to network locations and cloud storage is straightforward. There's even an integrated Terminal for you to make use of. It's handy having shortcut keys on show in the interface as well, and you can customize these as needed if you don't like the defaults.\n\nThere's certainly a lot going on, and while the interface takes a little bit of getting used to, that's to be expected—and it doesn't take long to learn what's what. The Pro version of the software comes with extra features, including layout themes, and integrations for FTP, Google Drive, and Dropbox: That's yours for a one-off fee of $29.99.\n\nQSpace Pro is the best Finder alternative I tested in terms of the interface customizations you get access to: You can tailor to a fine level of detail, though the default look isn't all that different from Finder. You can have up to four different system locations on view at once, with the panels arranged in a variety of different ways, and jumping between these layouts is easily done.\n\nAfter a short while using QSpace Pro I definitely felt I was better able to get around my Mac more efficiently, and when you've got a lot to do on your system, that really helps. Copying, moving, searching, deleting, tagging, and previewing is all intuitively and simply done, and you can easily hide parts of the interface if you know you won't need them.\n\nThe wealth of settings available in QSpace Pro is a testament to how much you can do with this: Keyboard shortcuts, the context menu, new file creation, batch operations, folder syncing, iCloud links, and app launching can all be customized, and those are just some of the options available. It's like Finder, but with a lot more going on.\n\nQSpace Pro isn't free, however: Its features cost a one-off fee of $27.99 via the Mac App Store (or $29.99 via a direct download), though at the time of writing, those prices are down to $12.99 and $13.99, respectively. If you go through the QSpace Pro website, you can test the software out for 30 days for free before buying.\n\nPath Finder is one of the Finder alternatives that's been around the longest, and I think it's the one I'm actually going to switch to permanently. It's absolutely packed with features and options to play around with, and if you spend a little time getting it set up the way you want it, it should seriously speed up all your file operations.\n\nThere are a choice of different layouts to pick from, including a dual-pane layout that makes moving and copying more straightforward, and I very much appreciate the \"stacking\" approach that lets you pile up several files and folders in a temporary holding pane first, before you do anything with them.\n\nBatch file operations are supported, as are synced folders, so you can merge and compare two folders on your system as required. There's also extensive use of bookmarks and tab presets, so that you can quickly jump to the places on your Mac system that you need to visit the most—something that isn't always simple to do in Finder.\n\nThe visual representations of how much space files and folders are taking up on disk is very handy, and so is the Dropbox integration (with Dropbox being my go-to cloud storage option). Admittedly it's not the most visually appealing of the software packages listed here, but that's not necessarily the most important thing in a file manager, and it adds all the features I didn't know I'd been missing from Finder.\n\nPath Finder is $29.99 for the year, but there's a 30-day trial available.",

    "description": "I haven't had to put it to use, but the peace of mind it provides is invaluable,",
    "fullText": "To be alive in 2025 is to assume you are being recorded at all times. There are cameras just about everywhere we go these days: Security cameras, video doorbells, and smartphones are frequently recording, and so ubiquitous that I tend to figure that if I go out in public, I'm being watched.\n\nBut when you're driving, it can be a different story. Sure, there are cameras on the road—either street cameras or cameras built directly into modern cars—but there are plenty of moments behind the wheel where nothing you do is recorded. You could view this as a nice reprieve from the surveillance of modern life, but it also means that if you get into an accident, it could quickly turn into a \"he said, she said\" incident. Someone could reverse directly into your car, but because there were no cameras around to document the accident, your insurance company could throw their hands in the air and make you both pay for something that wasn't your fault.\n\nI've never been in that situation, but I was tired of worrying about it. My car is on the older side, and doesn't come with any of the modern safety features newer cars now include—including cameras. Where something like a Tesla records everything in and around the car, my vehicle records nothing. If someone accidentally hit my car, or worse, intentionally tried to scam me, I could be out of luck, and without clear evidence I wasn't at fault.\n\nAfter following one too many threads online sharing such horror stories, I decided it was time to get myself a dashcam.But before I could, I was gifted one last Christmas—a Redtiger 4K dashcam. It was easy enough to set up, though even after a full year of use, I'm not taking full advantage of it yet: The main unit attaches to my front windshield, with a cable that plugs into the cigarette lighter port, but this particular model also comes with a rear camera that requires a little extra maneuvering to install. I've been a bit lazy on that front, but I should get cracking, since it would be helpful to have a camera protecting the back of my car, too.\n\nI almost wish I had some harrowing tale to tell that shows off how the dashcam saved me during the past year, or even a story about capturing some wild driving habits from my fellow drivers. But, spoiler alert: I haven't actually had to put it to use, as I've fortunately not been in an accident, or even experienced an interesting close call. But the peace of mind that comes with knowing that if an otherwise ambiguous fender bender has been refreshing. It's nice to know when I'm driving on a particularly busy road that I have a little extra protection should someone jump their lane or decide to text and drive.\n\nThere are so many different dashcam models, so I won't try to make the case that mine specifically is the one that everyone should buy. But there are a few things I like about it: First, the main unit records in 4K, which means your videos will be clear enough to use in the event you need to prove yourself innocent. While 4K takes up more recording space than 1080p, this model is designed to record over itself when it fills up. Since you probably don't need all your driving footage, you don't really need to worry about running out of space, and can grab the file when something actually happens. There are other features that I don't use, like wifi connectivity as well as a smart app, but I prefer to just grab the footage off the included SD card—at least, I would if I ever needed it.",

    "fullText": "Cybersecurity experts reveal what they do for high-profile clients targeted by hackers such as Scattered Spider\n\nThey call it “stopping the bleeding”: the vital window to prevent an entire database from being ransacked by criminals or a production line grinding to a halt.\n\nWhen a call comes into the cybersecurity firm S-RM, headquartered on Whitechapel High Street in east London, a hacked business or institution may have just minutes to protect themselves.\n\nS-RM, which helped a high-profile retail client recover from a Scattered Spider cyber-attack has become a quiet, often word-of-mouth, success.\n\nMany of the company’s senior workers are multilingual and have a minimal online footprint, which reveals scant but impressive CVs suggestive of corporate or government intelligence-based careers.\n\nS-RM now claims the UK’s largest cyber-incident response team. Its first-responder service is comprised of about 150 experts worldwide. It has clients who keep it on retainer, victims referred by insurers, and “walk-ins”: people who suddenly realise their business is under attack and call the first few results on their search engines.\n\nIn the case of the Scattered Spider victim, which the Guardian understands was not Marks & Spencer or the Co-op – two retailers that were attacked in 2025 – a 30-minute Teams call with a retailer became “a 24-hour call with a rotating cast of experts”, says Ted Cowell, the director of S-RM’s cyber business arm.\n\n“On average we’re getting back to clients within six minutes. Which is critical because often the first hours of a cyber incident can be the biggest chance window to determine the outcome of a case and its impact,” he says. “What can start as a network intrusion can then metastasise into a full-blown malware or ransomware scenario.”\n\nCowell, a Cambridge-educated Russian speaker, says that getting a handle on the attack during a “reconnaissance” period can result in a radically different outcome, compared with a slow response. Criminals often need time after their first penetration of a businesses’ systems to work out what is of most value. This short spell of time can therefore allow experts to prevent the most operationally painful of attacks. “Exfiltration” – the theft of critical data – and encryption, whereby businesses can be locked out of their own systems, can be the most damaging.\n\n“Sometimes we can stop it from going boom,” Cowell says. Teams focus on “stopping the bleeding” by limiting or cutting the attacker’s access to systems. This is what S-RM’s team was able to do with the Scattered Spider victim: stopping the detonation of malware across systems.\n\nBusiness is good as the cybercrime industry grows, but that comes with ethical challenges. S-RM and its industry peers have faced criticism for helping to facilitate the payment of ransoms to criminals who hijack businesses for money.\n\n“Extortion support” is an important part of S-RM’s work. This means its specialists are in the room when ransoms are negotiated, sometimes doing the negotiation itself on behalf of a client. Cowell appears keen to avoid criticisms of feeding organised crime by helping businesses to pay ransoms, or by acting for insurers that sell policies covering ransom payments.\n\n“We’re instructed by the policyholder, by the insured,” he says.\n\n“Our ambition is to guide ‘no payment’ decisions wherever and whenever possible,” he continues, adding that businesses are increasingly taking that approach and not paying ransoms.\n\n“Our role is to facilitate strategic thinking,” he says. “Give clients some structure to order their thoughts. They’ve probably not been in a situation like this before.\n\n“The businesses’ decision as to what they do is their own. We just offer the template of a crisis, how things play out based on our experience.\n\n“Why should we pay these criminals?” is a challenge Cowell says his team puts to top staff at affected businesses. “One of the things that we often educate boards on is that ransomware is an organised criminal enterprise.”\n\nThese nefarious groups have, he explains, “brands to uphold”. Established ransomware groups, typically speaking, will honour a settlement. S-RM also has an increasingly detailed picture of how these groups have behaved in previous negotiations.\n\nThe more established the group, the more likely they are to honour whatever settlement is agreed either by deleting stolen data or providing keys to decrypt critical files. S-RM offers a rundown of who’s who in terms of reliability, negotiating patterns, behaviours, even extending to sanctions concerns.\n\nThe latter rarely applies, however. Trying to impose sanctions on state-linked groups is a game of “whack-a-mole”, Cowell says. If so-called “threat actors” do appear on sanctions lists they tend to disband and reform in a new guise. The risk of putting money, albeit indirectly, into state-enemy hands is therefore another consideration for firms facing a cyber-attack.\n\nStill, businesses do sometimes decide to pay up. It can be rational for their company’s circumstances, and ultimately “it’s always their decision”, Cowell says.\n\nAs the corporate moral code of paying ransoms matures, and decisions not to fund organised crime become more common, restoration and recovery services have become a bigger part of the cybersecurity response market. Increasingly it is a priority to just get systems back up and running as soon as possible with the forensic analysis of how someone got into a system becoming secondary.\n\nIn recent years, the UK government’s cyber-intelligence role has also shifted significantly. The National Cyber Security Centre “over the last four or five years has hugely transformed”, Cowell says. The NCSC has caught up with its Nordic equivalents and now proactively reaches out to victims, telling them they may be targeted based on intelligence.\n\n“It was more of an information taker,” asking the likes of S-RM for information, which they would willingly provide with client consent, Cowell says.\n\n“[Now] they are playing a more robust role, getting on the front foot and getting people together to facilitate information sharing. We saw the impact of that with the Scattered Spider attacks.,” he adds.",

    "fullText": "New head of preparedness at OpenAI will face unnerving in-tray amid fears from some experts that AI could ‘turn on us’\n\nThe maker of ChatGPT has advertised a $555,000-a-year vacancy with a daunting job description that would cause Superman to take a sharp intake of breath.\n\nIn what may be close to the impossible job, the “head of preparedness” at OpenAI will be directly responsible for defending against risks from ever more powerful AIs to human mental health, cybersecurity and biological weapons.\n\nThat is before the successful candidate has to start worrying about the possibility that AIs may soon begin training themselves amid fears from some experts they could “turn against us”.\n\n“This will be a stressful job, and you’ll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,” said Sam Altman, the chief executive of the San Francisco-based organisation, as he launched the hunt to fill “a critical role” to “help the world”.\n\nThe successful candidate will be responsible for evaluating and mitigating emerging threats and “tracking and preparing for frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm”. Some previous executives in the post have lasted only for short periods.\n\nThe opening comes against a backbeat of warnings from inside the AI industry about the risks of the increasingly capable technology. On Monday, Mustafa Suleyman, the chief executive of Microsoft AI, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I honestly think that if you’re not a little bit afraid at this moment, then you’re not paying attention.”\n\nDemis Hassabis, the Nobel prize-winning co-founder of Google DeepMind, this month warned of risks that included AIs going “off the rails in some way that harms humanity”.\n\nAmid resistance from Donald Trump’s White House, there is little regulation of AI at national or international level. Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist known as one of the “godfathers of AI”, said recently: “A sandwich has more regulation than AI.” The result is that AI companies are largely regulating themselves.\n\nAltman said on X as he launched the job search: “We have a strong foundation of measuring growing capabilities, but we are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides both in our products and in the world, in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits. These questions are hard and there is little precedent.”\n\nOne user responded sardonically: “Sounds pretty chill, is there vacation included?”\n\nWhat is included is an unspecified slice of equity in OpenAI, a company that has been valued at $500bn.\n\nLast month, the rival company Anthropic reported the first AI-enabled cyber-attacks in which artificial intelligence acted largely autonomously under the supervision of suspected Chinese state actors to successfully hack and access targets’ internal data. This month, OpenAI said its latest model was almost three times better at hacking than three months earlier and said “we expect that upcoming AI models will continue on this trajectory”.\n\nOpenAI is also defending a lawsuit from the family of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old from California who killed himself after alleged encouragement from ChatGPT. It has argued Raine misused the technology. Another case, filed this month, claims ChatGPT encouraged the paranoid delusions of a 56-year-old in Connecticut, Stein-Erik Soelberg, who then murdered his 83-year old mother and killed himself.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said it was reviewing the filings in the Soelberg case, which it described as “incredibly heartbreaking” and that it was improving ChatGPT’s training “to recognise and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support”.",

It probably got us racing a bit sooner than if he hadn't gone by me, but I wanted to mark him and cover all bases and make the rest of them dance to my tune as much as we could.\"\n\nCasheldale Lad set the early pace with Lossiemouth on the shoulder, while Brighterdaysahead stayed on the outside along the back straight.\n\nAnzadam, with Patrick Mullins in the saddle, made a move to open a brief lead, yet it was Lossiemouth who roared back superbly and surged ahead on the home straight.\n\nBrighterdaysahead rose to the challenge, narrowing the gap but had to settle for second with Casheldale Lad (16-1) pipping Anzadam for third.",

    "description": "Jeet...",
    "fullText": "The talk of a new Middle East is belied by Israel’s attacks on Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and Iran.\n\nNo foreign leader has easier access to President Donald Trump than Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose scheduled meeting today at Mar-a-Lago will be the fifth time he’s hobnobbed with the US president in the past 10 months. In February, Netanyahu was the first overseas dignitary to visit the White House in Trump’s second term, and now the year ends with another meeting. Few foreign leaders have buttered up Trump with the aplomb of Netanyahu, who describes Trump as Israel’s “greatest friend.”\n\nIn Trump’s first four years in office, these enthusiastic words were more than earned. As Al Jazeera noted, “During his first term, Trump pushed US policy further in favour of Israel’s right-wing government. He moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, recognised and claimed Israeli sovereignty over Syria’s occupied Golan Heights and cut off funding to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).”\n\nThe situation in Trump’s second term is more complicated. Small but significant disagreements have opened up between Israel and the United States. Trump’s push for a foreign policy more focused on the Western Hemisphere—which includes bombing putative drug boats and threatening regime change in Venezuela—depends on shifting military resources away from Europe and the Middle East. In the National Security Strategy release in November, the Trump administration argued that the Middle East is “emerging as a place of partnership, friendship and investment.” Ironically, Trump’s pursuit of a pivot away from the Middle East is a continuation of unsuccessful efforts for a lighter US footprint in the region pursued by his predecessors Barack Obama and Joe Biden.\n\nTrump’s peace plans for the region have a pie-in-the-sky feel. They would entail the United States offshoring its military presence while pushing for a closer integration of its Arab allies with Israel and the emergence of a new government in Gaza. As Roger Cohen, Paris bureau chief for The New York Times, dryly noted, “Such optimism, based in large part on the Gaza peace agreement signed in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, on Oct. 13, looks overblown, much like President Trump’s claim that day that it took 3,000 years to reach a breakthrough of this kind.”\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles to Trump’s vision of a new Middle East is that Israel is having none of it. While Trump touts his ceasefire, Israel has continued to bomb Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria. In his meeting with Trump, Netanyahu is expected to push for a renewed bombing campaign against Iran as well.\n\nNetanyahu has no interest in the Middle East becoming a place of “partnership, friendship and investment.” Rather, the Israeli leader’s strategy is clearly one of maintaining regional hegemony by promoting chaos. This is the tried-and-true imperialist method of divide-and-conquer.\n\nThe conflicting goals of the United States and Israel can be most clearly seen in Syria. Cohen argues that there is ground for hope in the end of the civil war in Syria, with a unified nation now being rebuilt under the leadership of President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former jihadi who has pursued a policy of reconciliation. As Cohen noted:\n\nRemarkable progress has, however, also been made in a year. Mr. al-Sharaa has garnered support from the United States, Russia and China. He has secured the lifting of economic sanctions. He has remained steady in the face of repeated military provocations from Israel, and has begun to lay the basis of state institutions. He has been embraced by Mr. Trump and was ushered to the White House last month.\n\nUnfortunately, while Israel and its Arab allies are backing Syrian reconstruction, Netanyahu’s government is seeking security by keeping Syria divided. On December 23, a Washington Post report documented that Israel had been arming Druze militiamen in Syria who want a separate state. According to the report, “Some Israeli and American analysts argue that Israel’s aggressive use of military force in Syria and its clandestine efforts to promote Druze separatism were counterproductive and undercut relations at a time when Sharaa appeared eager to reach a diplomatic détente.”\n\nDana Stroul, a former senior Pentagon official, told the Washington Post:\n\n“There has been growing frustration in Washington that Israeli actions were setting back something most of Washington and everyone in the Middle East would actually like to see succeed: a stabilized, unified Syria. The basic argument to Israel is, look, you actually have leaders in Damascus who are willing to say the word ‘Israel’ and talk about a potential future with normalized relations, yet you just keep bombing or looking for a surrogate to work through.”\n\nTrump styles himself as an American First nationalist. There is every reason to oppose Israel’s belligerent foreign policy in terms of American national interest as well as on the grounds of international peace. It’s hard to find any rational benefit for the United States in Syria sinking back into chaos or in Iran being bombed. Further, criticism of Israel’s belligerence is rising not just among liberals but also on the MAGA right, with voices such as Marjorie Taylor Greene and Tucker Carlson warning of the dangers of more Middle Eastern wars.\n\nDespite this shifting political landscape, there’s no reason to put any faith in Trump standing up to Netanyahu. Everything in Trump’s record indicates his handling of foreign policy is fundamentally feckless and that he’s easily swayed by hawkish voices who remain powerful inside the Republican Party. While there are areas of disagreements between Netanyahu and Trump, the more crucial difference is between how invested each is in their policy preferences. Netanyahu is heavily invested in his vision of Israel as a hegemonic power in the Middle East that is willing to spread chaos to fend off any possible foe. Trump, by contrast, has no deep policy commitments, which makes him vulnerable to the suasion of Netanyahu and the pro-Israel lobby. Trump’s peace plans are a flimsy house of cards, which Netanyahu will easily topple.\n\nIn this time of unrelenting, often unprecedented cruelty and lawlessness, I’m grateful for Nation readers like you.\n\nSo many of you have taken to the streets, organized in your neighborhood and with your union, and showed up at the ballot box to vote for progressive candidates. You’re proving that it is possible—to paraphrase the legendary Patti Smith—to redeem the work of the fools running our government.\n\nAnd as we head into 2026, I promise that The Nation will fight like never before for justice, humanity, and dignity in these United States.\n\nAt a time when most news organizations are either cutting budgets or cozying up to Trump by bringing in right-wing propagandists, The Nation’s writers, editors, copy editors, fact-checkers, and illustrators confront head-on the administration’s deadly abuses of power, blatant corruption, and deconstruction of both government and civil society.\n\nWe couldn’t do this crucial work without you.\n\nThrough the end of the year, a generous donor is matching all donations to The Nation’s independent journalism up to $75,000. But the end of the year is now only days away.\n\nTime is running out to have your gift doubled. Don’t wait—donate now to ensure that our newsroom has the full $150,000 to start the new year.\n\nAnother world really is possible. Together, we can and will win it!",

    "fullText": "Head coach Ruben Amorim says if he had changed Manchester United's formation because of media pressure it would have been \"the end\" for him.\n\nAmorim moved away from a back three with wing-backs for the first time against Newcastle United and instead fielded an orthodox back four with two holding midfielders.\n\nAlthough he memorably once said not even the Pope could force him to change his system, Amorim says the ability to play with different formations has always been his plan.\n\nHowever he says he could only make the switch when his side were doing sufficiently well - otherwise it would look like he was bowing to external noise.\n\n\"When I came here last season, I understood maybe I don't have the players to play well in that system, but it was the beginning of a process,\" he said.\n\n\"We were trying to build an identity. Today is a different moment. We don't have a lot of players, and we need to adapt, so they understand why we are changing.\n\n\"It is not because of the pressure of you guys [media], or the fans.\n\n\"When you [media] talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand I'm changing because of you and I think that is the end for the manager.\n\n\"When we are playing well in our system, that is the moment to change.\n\n\"We are going to become a better team because when all the players return, we are not going to play with three defenders all the time.\"\n\nWith only two wins in eight games prior to beating Newcastle, it is arguable whether Amorim is correct to say his side have been playing well.\n\nHe is however working with a depleted squad, with seven senior players already ruled out of the home game against winless Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nThat number will increase if Mason Mount fails to recover from the injury that forced him out of the Newcastle game at half-time.\n\nCaptain Bruno Fernandes is one of those who will miss the Wolves game, even though he is urging his manager to allow him to return to action following his hamstring injury in the defeat at Aston Villa on 21 December.\n\n\"Bruno is already saying he needs to train,\" said Amorim.\n\n\"But there is no chance he is going to play against Wolves. No chance. You can write that.\"\n\nHowever, the 31-year-old will likely still be heavily involved, because while most players either watch matches from the directors' box or a private box when they are injured or suspended, Fernandes kept a close eye on the warm-ups before the Newcastle game from the mouth of the tunnel.\n\nAmorim expects his captain to continue to offer input.\n\n\"The guy is a leader,\" he said. \"He cannot be that guy that when he is not playing, he's not talking and speaking. He's always speaking. That's why he's the captain.\n\n\"He has bad things sometimes - the way he moves his arms - but he has a lot of good things. After he recovers after games, or even after treatment, he goes to watch the other guys training. There is a lot of things you don't see.\n\n\"I don't know if he wants my job or not, but he's a leader. The guy is a leader.\"\n\nWhile the precise date for Fernandes' return - and that of Kobbie Mainoo, Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire, who are also injured - is unknown, by the end of January Noussair Mazraoui, Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo will have returned from the Africa Cup of Nations.",

    "fullText": "Stop me if you’ve heard this before…\n\nTwo blue-blood college football programs with a rich history of national championships are set to square off, but the past few years have been much kinder to one team than the other.\n\nOne team is the defending national champion, the previous year having ended its relatively brief national title drought by thoroughly dominating a fellow, one-loss blue blood program in the championship game. This program last won a national title a decade prior, so the gap between titles had become uncomfortably long for this program’s fanbase. Of course, the previous year’s title game wasn’t nearly as close as the final score suggests. The now-defending champs raced out to a multi-touchdown lead by halftime, and lead 20+ points in the third quarter.\n\nAlthough the defending champs lost quite a bit of a talent to the NFL, including multiple first round draft picks in the previous year’s draft, this team is still stacked with future-NFL talent up and the down the roster. This team’s star safety and stable of future-pro wide receivers are particularly problematic for their opponents. The quarterback is also a Heisman finalist. Nearly every pundit in the nation believes this is the most talented team in the country, and nobody is expecting this team to lose.\n\nOn the other side of the field is the underdog. A talented team in its own right that is coming out of a long rebuild – the previous three years saw this team go a combined 21-15. But signs of progress are there. At the helm is a former offensive assistant who returned to helm this program 16 years later after building his head coaching experience. This team’s relatively new coach is a particularly strong recruiter, and this program is coming off multiple Top 10 ranked recruiting classes. Signs of emergence really started to show once this program was able to consistently beat its rivals, even though those wins did not necessarily translate to conference or national titles.\n\nThis season, the underdog built its reputation on defense. No team managed to score in the 30’s, including its premier non-conference opponent – a top 10 team that itself had national title aspirations, but finished its season with two losses and on the outside looking in. In fact, the offense looked so anemic at times that this team won a road game despite scoring just 10 points. So defense is definitely this team’s calling card, but the offense’s best weapon is a freshman stud who was the conference’s freshman of the year.\n\nThe “underdog” is both 2025 Miami and 2002 Ohio State:\n\nOhio State was a combined 21-15 from 1999 to 2001. Miami was a nearly identical 22-16 from 2022-2024.\n\nDespite the mediocre record, Ohio State was coming off back-to-back wins over arch-rival Michigan in 2001 and 2002. Despite the mediocre record, Miami was coming off back-to-back wins over arch-rival Florida State in 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe premiere non-conference win for 2002 Ohio State was 25-7 at home against Washington St., which finished the regular season with two losses and ranked No. 10 in the AP Poll. The premiere non-conference win for 2025 Miami was 27-24 at home against Notre Dame, which finished the regular season with two losses and ranked No. 9 in the AP Poll.\n\nHead Coach Jim Tressell was an assistant offensive coach for Ohio State from 1983 to 1985 before returning to Ohio State 16 years later in 2001. Head Coach Mario Cristobal was an assistant offensive coach for Miami from 2004 to 2006 before returning to Miami 16 years later in 2022.\n\nAccording to 247Sports, the Buckeyes had top ten recruiting classes in 2000 and 2001 (No. 6 and 9). The Hurricanes had top ten recruiting classes in 2023 and 2024 (No. 7 and 4).\n\nThe 2002 Ohio State Buckeyes typically held teams to under 20 points, never allowing a team to score 30, which was necessary considering how anemic their offense was at times. The 2025 Miami Hurricanes typically held teams under 20 points, never allowing a team to score 30, which was necessary considering how anemic their offense was at times.\n\n2002 Ohio State’s best offensive weapon was true freshman RB Maurice Clarett, that season’s Big Ten Freshman of the Year. 2025 Miami’s best offensive weapon is true freshman WR Malachi Toney, this season’s ACC Freshman of the Year.\n\nThe “defending champion” is both 2002 Miami and 2025 Ohio State:\n\nOhio State won the 2024 national title, beating blue-blood Notre Dame in a game that was 31-7 in the 3rd Quarter. Miami won the 2001 national title, beating blue-blood Nebraska in a game that was 34-0 at halftime.\n\nOhio State last won a national title a decade prior in 2014. Miami last won a national title a decade prior in 1991.\n\nFollowing their 2024 title run, in the 2025 NFL Draft the Buckeyes had 4 first round selections (WR Emeka Egbuka, G Donovan Jackson, DT Tyliek Williams, and DT Josh Simmons) plus another 3 second round selections (RB Quinshon Judkins, RB TreVeyon Henderson, and DE JT Tuimoloau). In the 2002 NFL Draft, the Hurricanes had 5 first round selections (OT Bryan McKinnie, TE Jeremy Shockey, CB Philip Buchanon, FS Ed Reed, and CB Mike Rumph) plus another second round selection (RB Clinton Portis).\n\nThe 2025 Ohio State Buckeyes are led by Heisman Finalist, QB Julian Sayin. The 2002 Miami Hurricanes were led by Heisman Finalist, QB Ken Dorsey.\n\nArguably 2025 Ohio State’s best offensive weapons were receivers for their Heisman Finalist quarterback, namely WRs Jeremiah Smith, Carnell Tate, and Brandon Inniss. Arguably 2002 Miami’s best offensive weapons were receivers for their Heisman Finalist quarterback, namely WRs Andre Johnson and Roscoe Parrish plus TE Kellen Winslow, Jr.\n\nArguably 2025 Ohio State’s defensive leaders are S Caleb Downs and LB Arvell Reese. Arguably 2002 Miami’s defensive leaders were S Sean Taylor and LB Jonathan Vilma.\n\nIt’s like looking into a mirror a quarter-of-a-century apart. For ‘Canes fans, hopefully history repeats itself.",

    "title": "What has been the most encouraging part of the 2025 Lions season?",
    "description": "2025 was a failure for the Detroit Lions, but there were still some encouraging parts.",
    "fullText": "In a season unanimously viewed as a failure, there are many parts of the 2025 Detroit Lions that can be considered disappointing. Whether it is the continued onslaught of injuries, the regression from the offense, the struggles of the defense, or the inability to reach the playoffs—let alone compete for a Super Bowl—a lot went wrong for Detroit. Yet with one game left to play before the book closes on the season, can we acknowledge some positive moments?\n\nMany will fall into the “nothing can be viewed positively since they missed the playoffs” camp. While it is understandable to judge a season in a black and white way, either success or failure, the truth of the matter is that the Lions are not staring down the barrel of a total rebuild—they can expect tough questions with tough answers, sure, but not a total rebuild. The core of the team is still intact, and it’s not hard to envision a rebound next season.\n\nToday’s Question of the Day is:\n\nMy answer: Jack Campbell’s breakout.\n\nThere are a lot of honorable mentions for this discussion. Jahmyr Gibbs showcased an elite skill set—when the blocking held up. Jameson Williams had some duds, but he nonetheless put together another 1,000-yard season, all while growing as a route runner. Al-Quadin Muhammad proved that his late 2024 tear was not a fluke with over 10 sacks in 2025, albeit in limited snaps—perhaps too limited. Thomas Harper proved to be an excellent waiver wire claim, not only starting multiple games but playing fairly well when called upon.\n\nHowever, they all pale in comparison to Campbell’s ascension. His 2023 rookie campaign was rough: the flashes of athleticism were there, but the mental game lagged far behind. In 2024, he started to put it together, looking far more comfortable as a central figure on defense. This season, Campbell has elevated his game to a Pro Bowl level and, with enough support, arguably an All-Pro level too.\n\nHe has taken significant strides in run defense and is now perhaps the best run stopping linebacker in the league (per PFF, he is first in run defense grade among linebackers). Equally impressive has been his pass rushing prowess. He is no Micah Parsons, but his blitzing ability has vastly improved over previous seasons. In the past, his blitzes were carried by his athleticism. The athleticism was still present in 2025, but he complemented it with a knack for finding the right lane to exploit. He presently has five sacks on the season, third on the team behind Aidan Hutchinson (13.5) and Muhammad (11.0). While this might say a lot about the Lions’ pass rush, that should not discount the role Campbell has played.\n\nCampbell is second in the NFL in tackles, and he has earned every single one of them. For as bad as the Lions were in 2025, Campbell was a bright spot nearly every week.",

    "title": "What was behind Enea Bastianini's worst season in MotoGP?",
    "description": "Switching from Ducati to KTM was “close to a shock” for the seven-time grand prix winner Bastianini",
    "fullText": "Enea Bastianini has offered insight into why he struggled to such an extent during a wretched first season on KTM’s MotoGP bike in 2025.\n\nBastianini moved to Tech3 this year on a factory-spec bike, partnering Maverick Vinales in an all-new line-up at KTM’s secondary squad.\n\nBut from his first test with the Austrian marque in Valencia 2024, it was clear that the RC16 was not playing to his strength - and a crash in which he completely wrecked his bike only reinforced that impression.\n\nProblems persisted when the season kicked off in March, leaving Bastianini in the shadows of his new team-mate Vinales, who impressed with his adaptation to the RC16. Across the opening 10 rounds and before Vinales broke his shoulder at the Sachsenring, Bastianini managed just 42 points compared to 69 for the former.\n\nThere was a ray of hope that the Italian had turned around his campaign when he qualified fourth in Hungary and followed that up with a podium in Barcelona, but it ultimately amounted to little more than a brief respite.\n\nHe eventually ended the season a distant 14th in the standings, scoring just over a third of the points Pedro Acosta accumulated on the factory KTM (112 points vs 307).\n\nIt was a far cry from the heights Bastianini reached just last season, when he guided his works Ducati GP24 to two victories and seven other grand prix podiums.\n\nIn fact, this was easily the worst season of his MotoGP career; even in his rookie season in 2021, he managed to finish 11th in the championship and score 102 points from 18 rounds at a time when there were no sprint races.\n\nBastianini makes no secret in explaining how steep his learning curve proved after switching manufacturers for the first time in MotoGP.\n\n“I think the adaptation to the bike this year has been very complicated for me, starting from the first test when I jumped,” he said. “It's not been a shock, but very close to a shock because the bike was very different from the other one.\n\n“When it's like this, you have every weekend to work, to change something. Also [despite] this, we were competitive on Sundays.\n\n“Last year, at the end of the season, I was fast in the sprints and I was always on top. I knew how it would be and what the approach of the weekend was, but you have to be clear. This year, the situation was not clear to me.”\n\nFor much of 2025, Bastianini found himself on the back foot early in the weekend, struggling with his feeling on the bike on Fridays. While there was often clear progress overnight and into Sunday, he was frequently left with too much ground to make up.\n\nAt Valencia, for instance, the 27-year-old toiled near the back in practice and qualified only 20th. Yet his race pace was strong, allowing him to climb steadily through the field to finish a solid 10th.\n\n“Friday complicated, Saturday a bit less and Sunday in the race we are competitive. This happened many times. I think [it happened] every weekend, from just two or three weekends apart,” he highlighted the trend.\n\nBastianini’s improved pace in race trim was partly down to his increased confidence on medium tyres, which are preferred during longer grands prix. With Michelin’s soft rubber, he suffered from a phenomenon called the ‘rear pushing the front’, which had a detrimental impact on his cornering ability.\n\n“We are also competitive in the race because I find the confidence to be fast with the medium tyre,” he explained. “When we put a soft on the rear, the bike gives me the opposite; no confidence and I can't push.\n\n“[With the soft tyre], the rear pushes me out in every corner and it's also much more complicated to turn. With the medium, it's much better for me to slide with the rear, I'm much more confident. Lap by lap in the race, I'm much more confident. This has happened every time.”\n\nBastianini was pinning his hopes on the post-season Valencia test to find a breakthrough and head to the winter break on a positive note, but after trying a variety of components in a condensed schedule, he left Spain without the answers he had been seeking.\n\n\"I still haven't cleared up all my doubts about certain things,” he conceded. “We also tested two quite different bikes. The new bike had a different chassis and a few other slightly different things. But I still haven't really understood the pros and cons of both. The only thing I've understood is that the seat is much more ergonomic, anyway.\n\n“But hey, I'm happier to have wrapped up 2025.”\n\nBastianini knows that the first pre-season test of 2025 will be important for him as he heads into the second and final year of his KTM contract.\n\n\"More than confidence, I'm leaving knowing what awaits me next year. I finished 17th [in the test], and quite far back. So I wanted to finish a bit higher up the standings, to end on a high note. But we couldn't work on the set-up.\n\n“Therefore, Sepang will be a crucial test for me: I'll have to work very hard and try to make the most of the three days we have.”\n\nKTM’s 850cc engine for 2027 MotoGP season breaks cover in Jerez test\n\nWhy KTM would be wise to prepare for a future without Pedro Acosta\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

They lost Kai Havertz from the opening day, while captain Martin Odegaard and Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli, Noni Madueke and Max Dowman have had spells on the sidelines.\n\nNow, after injuries mainly affecting attacking players, it is the Arsenal backline which is suffering.\n\nArteta was forced to play Declan Rice in an unfamiliar right-back position against Brighton on Saturday because Jurrien Timber was injured and Riccardo Calafiori picked up an issue in the warm-up.\n\nGabriel returned from injury in the 2-1 win, but the return dates of Cristhian Mosquera, Timber and Calafiori are not known.\n\n\"We're going to be really aware of the situation and the timescale of certain players,\" Arteta said.\n\n\"We have to be actively looking, and then can we do it or not?\n\n\"That's a different story, but our job is to be always very prepared because something can happen.\"\n\nLatest Arsenal news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Arsenal - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Arne Slot could dip into the transfer market after losing Alexander Isak to injury for the foreseeable future",
    "fullText": "Liverpool could become major players in the January transfer market after Alexander Isak’s serious injury ruled him out for several months.\n\nArne Slot can at least lean on Hugo Ekitike, with the French forward settling quickly to life in the Premier League.\n\n“It’s going to be a long injury, for a couple of months,” Slot said of Isak, who joined the Reds from Newcastle for £125m in the summer and has scored just three goals in 16 appearances in all competitions. “It’s a big disappointment for him and, as a result, for us.”\n\nBut reinforcements could come to boost the Reds after a testing first half of the season.\n\nHere are the latest stories surrounding the transfer market at Anfield:\n\nAntoine Semenyo has been one of the players of the season for Bournemouth and is the main name strongly attached to the Reds so far ahead of next month’s window opening. The 25-year-old is also versatile, with an ability to play across the front line, and has scored eight goals and assisted three \n\nBut while the Reds have registered an interest in Semenyo, Manchester City have moved ahead of Liverpool in the race to sign the Ghanaian international, with The Independent understanding City have opened talks with Bournemouth in a bid to sign the player.\n\nSemenyo has a £65m release clause in his contract with the Cherries and while a move is not yet wrapped up, Liverpool face a decision whether to trigger the release clause themselves and match City’s interest. Semenyo would like to decide upon his next club before 1 January, while his release clause is thought to expire on 10 January.\n\nFabrizio Romano says that Liverpool are “open” to strengthening the squad next month, though that is unlikely to involve Marc Guehi, having had a bid accepted before the move collapsed late in the window last summer.\n\nThe Crystal Palace star is likely to wait until next summer for a move on a free transfer, though Liverpool will still be in the race with Bayern Munich are also strongly linked.\n\nMohamed Salah’s future will also need to be settled, though the Egypt star will complete his time at the Afcon 2025 with the Pharaohs before returning to Anfield next month. Ibrahima Konate and Andy Robertson will similarly go into amid uncertainty, with both entering the final six months of their current contracts. Liverpool remain committed to extending Konate’s deal but will not budge from their existing wage structure, according to Sky Sports.\n\nBrentford forward Igor Thiago, after his blazing start to the season with the Bees with 11 goals in 17 Premier League games, and PSG’s Bradley Barcola are names that have floated around recent gossip columns, though neither move has accelerated or gathered pace just yet.\n\nIsak’s injury has also prompted reports of interest in various strikers, with PSG’s Goncalo Ramos, Juventus’ Dusan Vlahovic and England international Ivan Toney named as potential short-term solutions, but nothing concrete has been established.\n\nMeanwhile Harvey Elliott, currently struggling for game time on loan at Aston Villa, is unlikely to return to Anfield after Slot’s concise summary of the Reds’s stance.\n\n“No, Harvey is an Aston Villa player and he is supposed to be going there for a season. So, questions about him, the best thing to ask is Aston Villa - they are doing really well, by the way.”",

That would be something we thought would be pretty cool. In this league, it’s hard to win on the road, and we accomplished that today.”\n\nIn victory, Maye joined Tom Brady (11 times) and Drew Bledsoe (twice) as the only New England quarterbacks to reach 4,000 yards passing in a season.\n\n“They don’t give me a vote,” Head coach Mike Vrabel said of the league MVP buzz around Maye. “But there is nobody else we want as our quarterback.”\n\nHATS & T-SHIRTS pic.twitter.com/bBUdcH1ya5\n\n— z - New England Patriots (@Patriots) December 29, 2025\n\nVrabel praised the team’s effort but emphasized the need for continued improvement.\n\n“We’re really focused on trying to improve late in the year,” Vrabel said. “I’m just happy that everyone was able to play. We got a lot of really good efforts early on and complementary football.”\n\nVrabel added that preparation remains key as his team looks to claim the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoff bracket.\n\n“From the get-go, we’ve tried to focus on having everybody that’s here prepare as a starter,” Vrabel said.\n\nThe Patriots will host the Miami Dolphins Sunday, Jan. 4, at 4:25 p.m. Boston 25 will air the game.\n\nPatriots schedule update:#MIAvsNE will be played on 1/4 at 4:25 PM on FOX. pic.twitter.com/xqjz1oBjAb\n\n— z - New England Patriots (@Patriots) December 29, 2025\n\nWhile the Patriots have already locked up their first division title since 2019, there is still much left to play for. New England needs a Week 18 win and a Denver Broncos loss to get the No. 1 seed and a first-round bye in the NFL playoffs.\n\nBoth Denver and New England are 13-3, but because of their better record versus shared opponents—most notably the Las Vegas Raiders, who defeated the Patriots early in the season—the Broncos control their own fate and have a tiebreaker over the Patriots.\n\nDownload the FREE Boston 25 News app for breaking news alerts.\n\nFollow Boston 25 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch Boston 25 News NOW",

    "fullText": "Arsenal host Aston Villa on Tuesday, which also happens to be Ollie Watkins’ 30th birthday.\n\nWatkins hasn’t been in great form this season, but things have been picking up lately, particularly with the striker scoring twice in a win away to Chelsea on Saturday night.\n\nThe next game has particular significance to the player, not just because it’s against Premier League leaders Arsenal, but because Watkins’ family will be there supporting the Gunners.\n\nFar from hoping his family enjoy the game, Watkins has instead told the media he wants to send them home disappointed.\n\n“I’ve got a lot of family coming to it that support them (Arsenal),” Watkins admitted.\n\n“So they can be at the other end and hopefully watch me have the same outcome as [against Chelsea] in a couple of days.”\n\nAs mentioned, Watkins hasn’t been at his best so far in 2025/26, scoring just five goals and assisting one in 25 appearances for Villa. Yet it’s fair to say things have improve in December, with five of those six goal contributions coming in his five league games so far this month.\n\nThat includes a brace in an away win over Brighton, an assist in a home win over Manchester United, and another brace in an away win over Chelsea.\n\nWatkins was also constantly threatening against Arsenal in Villa’s 2-1 victory in early December, despite neither scoring nor assisting and wasting a big chance when in on goal against David Raya. He’ll hope to make his chances count this time around.",

    "title": "Usyk vs Wilder edges nearer as date and location details emerge",
    "description": "Oleksandr Usyk has been granted a voluntary title defence, which the unified heavyweight champion may use to face Deontay Wilder",
    "fullText": "Oleksandr Usyk’s manager has confirmed that a fight with Deontay Wilder is “very likely”, while sharing details on when and where the bout could take place.\n\nUsyk, the unified heavyweight champion, has been linked to a surprise fight with Wilder despite their contrasting form – with the unbeaten Ukrainian twice becoming undisputed champion in the last two years, while the American is 2-4 dating back to 2020.\n\nUsyk last fought in July, stopping Daniel Dubois to regain undisputed status at heavyweight, and he was then ordered to face WBO interim champion Joseph Parker. However, Usyk took time out to address an injury, and in the meantime, Parker was stopped by Fabio Wardley.\n\nThat seemingly set up Wardley for a shot at Usyk, but the latter vacated the official WBO belt and has been granted a voluntary title defence. It appears he will use that option to face Wilder – one of the more-dominant heavyweights of this generation, but now a faded force, it seems.\n\n“It’s very likely,” Klimas told The National on Monday, “because right now we’re working on it, and we’re working on some multi-fight agreement for Oleksandr.\n\n“As soon as we’re going to confirm that, we’re going to jump in. And some talks already are going on with the team of Wilder. We’re looking at Las Vegas or Los Angeles, and dates are the end of April, beginning of May.\n\n“Wilder is one of the best names Oleksandr didn’t face yet. He’s still in good shape, and he’s still a fighter, so he’s interesting. And as well, it’s the United States.”\n\nWilder last fought in June, stopping Tyrrell Anthony Herndon in seven rounds to bounce back from two straight losses, having been knocked out by Zhilei Zhang in 2024 and outpointed by Parker in 2023.\n\nPreviously, the 40-year-old held the WBC title from 2015 to 2020, ultimately losing it in the first of two consecutive KO defeats by Tyson Fury.\n\nFury held that belt until 2024, when Usyk outpointed the Briton to become undisputed heavyweight king for the first time. Usyk gave up the IBF title before outpointing Fury again, but he regained the belt from Dubois this July – with his second KO of “Dynamite”.\n\nKlimas continued, “I cannot say that [Usyk] is not going to be fighting in the Riyadh Season,” referencing potential Saudi Arabian involvement in his next fight. “He might be fighting in the Riyadh Season, but as far as right now, we don’t have any offers or anything like that from them.\n\n“No, actually [it] is a different group from the United States. It’s not official yet, so I cannot tell you.”\n\nKlimas also addressed Usyk’s future, with the former undisputed cruiserweight champion seemingly in the twilight of his career at the age of 38.\n\n“He has at least two more years, as he says,” Klimas said. “I cannot go inside of his body, but he feels strong. It’s not time for him to hang up his gloves, and he’s ready to go.”",

    "title": "Slopes Are Empty as a Labor Dispute Shuts Down Telluride Colo",
    "description": "Now, vacationers looking to ski are wondering what to do and merchants are hoping it doesn’t last.",
    "fullText": "The ski runs above the mountain town of Telluride, Colo., sat eerily empty on Saturday. Chair lifts hung as motionless as icicles. Tourists slumped beside outdoor fire pits, trying not to think about the money they had spent on ski vacations now upended by a labor dispute.\n\n“This is the first time I’ve seen snow in six years,” Alexander Caro, 23, who flew in from Miami with his family, said as he looked hungrily at the base of the ski mountain, now blocked off by “closed” signs.\n\nA few feet away, a golden Labrador retriever played fetch in the snow beside the resort’s shuttered main lift. It was the closest anyone would get to having fun on the mountain this holiday weekend, after the resort decided to shut down its operations in response to a vote by the ski patrollers’ union to reject a contract offer and go on strike for higher pay.\n\nThe resort and its owner, Chuck Horning, a real-estate investor based in California, blamed the patrollers for the shutdown. In an open letter, Mr. Horning accused the patrol union of rejecting what he called “industry-leading, livable and sustainable” pay increases that would have raised the starting pay for patrollers to about $24 an hour.\n\nGraham Hoffman, the president of the 78-member Telluride Professional Ski Patrol Association, said the union had already come down from its initial demand of an increase of $8 per hour.\n\nThe current average pay for a ski patroller is $29 an hour, according to the union. The ski patrol provides medical assistance to skiers and guidance on the mountain, and helps to reduce the likelihood of avalanches. Patrollers say it is demanding and sometimes dangerous work, its perils highlighted by a recent avalanche at Mammoth Mountain that caught two patrollers.\n\nMr. Hoffman said the resort deserved the blame for the economic damage that might come from stopping the lifts.\n\n“We didn’t shut the mountain down,” he told several dozen ski patrollers in red jackets on Saturday morning, as they prepared to picket beside the gondola that connects the old mining town of Telluride to the slopes and the neighboring chalet-style town of Mountain Village.\n\nThe towns are scrambling to give visitors something to do by lighting fire pits and setting up ice-sculpting events and children’s play areas, or urging them to go hiking or snowmobiling. Local officials say there has not yet been a flood of cancellations. But they worry that few visitors will be willing to spend $10,000 on a winter trip to Telluride if the mountain stays closed.\n\n“They came out to ski,” Mayor Teddy Errico of Telluride said.\n\nThe clash between the ski patrol union and its wealthy out-of-town owner has intensified the debate over the chasm between the superrich and everyone else in gilded resort towns like Telluride, where the median home price has soared to nearly $4 million since the pandemic. Many workers have been priced out of Telluride and, unable to find subsidized housing, have little choice but to commute an hour along treacherous mountain roads.\n\nTom Sokolowski, who at 80 years old is one of Telluride’s oldest and longest-serving ski patrollers, said he got his start on the mountain in the early 1970s, long before the Four Seasons began selling $7 million “private residences” or restaurants served $150 Tomahawk steak dinners. Back then, Telluride was still a dwindling old mining town in the remote San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado.\n\nHe said he never paid more than $150 in rent — a far cry from the $1,500 a month that some newcomers now pay to rent a room.\n\nBut Mr. Sokolowski said it was never easy to cobble together a living in a tourism-dependent town like Telluride, even before the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Tom Cruise began snapping up real estate. Because the ski season runs from late November through April, most patrollers are considered seasonal workers who do not receive health insurance. Many spend the off-season working construction and maintenance jobs, or as mountain guides or in restaurants.\n\n“The ski bum life is almost done,” Mr. Sokolowski said. “That’s why we’re doing this.”\n\nTensions between workers and industry have roiled Telluride ever since its early mining days. In the early 1900s, gold and silver miners struck for minimum wages and better working conditions. But when the mining company brought in replacement workers, the strike spiraled into what newspapers called “a bloody riot.”\n\nThis time, many who live in overwhelmingly liberal Telluride — population 2,500, where utility boxes are plastered with “Eliminate Billionaires” stickers — say they support the ski patrol. As the patrollers marched down the main street on Saturday, snowy peaks towering above them, bus drivers and chauffeurs for luxury rental services honked in support.\n\nMr. Horning makes for an easy villain around Telluride. Local officials call him an absentee owner who has erratically cycled through ski-area managers, including, local officials said, firing his own son, and picked fights over funding the free gondola service and a summer-concert series. Local leaders openly call for him to sell the ski area, and an anonymous internet campaign has even cropped up to “chuck Chuck.”\n\n“We have an owner who’s unwilling to invest in his own company, his own resort, his own employees,” Paul Wisor, the town manager of the Mountain Village, said in an interview.\n\nNancy Clark, a spokeswoman for the ski resort, said the area was working on contingency plans that would allow it to reopen at least some of the mountain. She criticized the personal attacks against Mr. Horning as “over the top.”\n\n“Whether people like Chuck or not, what they may not realize is that their extreme nastiness impacts everyone at the ski resort,” she said in an email. “When people attack Chuck, they are indirectly attacking every single person who works at that resort.”\n\nThe strike and shutdown come during a bleak start to the winter for much of the Mountain West. Snow levels in Colorado are tied for the worst on record, and mountainsides around Telluride that would normally be gleaming white are brown and barren.\n\nAs a few meager flakes swirled on Saturday afternoon, Greg Shawcroft, 30, who runs a food cart in Mountain Village near the lift, was just hoping the snow would come and lifts would start spinning. He blamed Mr. Horning for the shutdown, but said his business could not afford much more pain.\n\n“I’m torn,” he said. “I want ski patrol to get what they deserve, but at what cost to the community?”",

    "title": "Meaning and possible origin of \"the (dog's) bollocks\" (2019)",
    "description": "UK, 1980s—the very best—perhaps from ‘it sticks out like a dog’s ballocks’, denoting something obvious, hence someone or something that sticks out from the rest",
    "fullText": "The British-English slang phrase the dog’s bollocks, also the bollocks, means the very best, the acme of excellence.\n\n(Remark: I have presented the origin of American-English synonyms such as the bee’s knees and the frog’s eyebrows in “the cat’s whiskers”, and all that jazz.)\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary (3rd edition – 2008) says that the bollocks is a shortening of the dog’s bollocks. However, since the latter phrase is attested in 1986, and the former in 1981, it is also possible that the bollocks actually predates the dog’s bollocks as a superlative.\n\nThe origin of this use of the dog’s bollocks/the bollocks is obscure. However, an explanation was given in Volume 1: A – I of The New Partridge1 Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English (Routledge, 2006), by Tom Dalzell and Terry Victor:\n\ndog’s bollocks; dog’s ballocks; the bollocks noun\n\nanything considered to be the finest, the most excellent, the best UK, 1989\n\nDerived from the phrase ‘It sticks out like a dog’s ballocks’2 said of something that the speaker considers obvious, hence the sense of ‘someone or something that sticks out from the rest’.\n\nThe same edition mentioned the use of dog’s ballocks in a different sense:\n\ndog’s ballocks noun\n\nin typography, a colon dash (:—) UK, 1961\n\n1 The New-Zealand born lexicographer Eric Honeywood Partridge (1894-1979) first published A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English in 1937.\n\n2 In this respect, it is interesting to remark that the British-English phrase a racing dog’s bollocks, attested in 1988, denotes something that protrudes.\n\nFor the explanation given in The New Partridge Dictionary to be plausible, the phrase it sticks out like a dog’s ballocks must predate the use of the dog’s bollocks/the bollocks in the sense ‘the most excellent’. This is possible, because:\n\n– the bollocks is attested in this sense in 1981, the dog’s bollocks in 1986;\n\n– it sticks out like a dog’s ballocks is recorded in the 8th edition (Routledge, 1984) of Eric Partridge’s A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English, edited by Paul Beale—this signifies that it sticks out like a dog’s ballocks predates the 8th edition by several years (Paul Beale goes as far as writing that it dates from “ca. 1920”, but without giving any attestation).\n\nThe following are the entries dog’s ballocks and dog’s prick in the 8th edition (Routledge, 1984) of Eric Partridge’s A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English, edited by Paul Beale—incidentally, dog’s prick is absent from the above-mentioned edition of The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English:\n\ndog’s ballocks. The typographical colon-dash (:—): C. 20. See dog’s prick.—2. Esp. in the phrase ‘It sticks out like a dog’s ballocks’, said of something that the speaker considers is patently obvious: low: since ca. 1920.\n\n[…]\n\ndog’s prick. An exclamation mark: authors’ and journalists’: C. 20.\n\nIn the 3rd edition (Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd., 1949) of A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English, Eric Partridge had recorded dog’s ballocks only in the sense ‘colon-dash’:\n\ndog’s ballocks. The typographical colon-dash (:—): C. 20. Cf. dog’s prick.\n\n[…]\n\ndog’s prick. An exclamation mark: authors’ and journalists’: C. 20.\n\nEARLIEST INSTANCE OF THE BOLLOCKS\n\nThe phrase the bollocks is first recorded as an expression of praise for the Yamaha TZ750 in the British magazine Super Bike of September 1981:\n\n“The Absolute Bollocks”\n\nWhen Superlatives Fail – Get Crude\n\nExclusive: We test Britain’s only road-going TZ 750\n\nEARLIEST INSTANCES OF THE DOG’S BOLLOCKS\n\nThe earliest known occurrence of the dog’s bollocks is from—or related to—the 1986 version of The Gambler, a musical by Peter Brewis, Bob Goody and Mel Smith, first staged at Hampstead Theatre, London, on 15th April of that year. The quotation in the 3rd edition of the Oxford English Dictionary is as follows:\n\nin P. Brewis et al. Gambler (cassette tape sleeve notes): ‘They are of the opinion that, when it comes to Italian opera, Pavarotti is the dog’s bollocks.’\n\nAnd, in Kick the Bucket and Swing the Cat: The Balderdash & Piffle Collection of English Words, and their Curious Origins (BBC Books, 2008), Alex Games explains:\n\nPeter Brewis […] told us of a play he wrote called The Gambler (along with Mel Smith and Bob Goody) which includes the immortal line ‘when it comes to Italian opera, Pavarotti is the dog’s bollocks’.\n\nThe phrase the dog’s bollocks then appeared as the title of the annual issue of the British comic magazine Viz for 1989:\n\nANOTHER HARD ONE\n\nVIZ\n\nTHE DOG’S BOLLOCKS\n\nTHE BEST OF ISSUES 26 TO 31\n\nNOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN, OLD FARTS OR GUARDIANS OF PUBLIC MORALS\n\nThe Liverpool Echo (Liverpool, Lancashire, England) mentioned that annual issue of Viz on Saturday 16th December 1989:\n\nTop Ten on Merseyside\n\n•B•O•O•K•S•\n\n1, The Greatest Batman Stories Ever Told, 2. The Pocket Wine Guide, Hugh Johnson, 3. Red Dwarf, Grant Naylor, 4. The Dogs [sic] Bollocks, VIZ Comic, 5. Bygone Merseyside, Derek Whale, 6. The Book Of Crap Jokes, VIZ Comic, 7. Demon Lord Of Karanda, David Eddings, 8. Delia Smith’s Complete Illustrated Cookery, 9, The Ginger Tree. Oswald Wynd, 10, Foucault’s Pendulum. Umberto Eco,\n\nThe earliest occurrence of the dog’s bollocks that I have found is from Desert rations keep the rats happy in Mandalay Drive, by David Sharrock, published in The Guardian (London and Manchester, England) of Friday 7th December 1990—the author reported from a British base somewhere in the eastern Arabian desert:\n\nAn invitation to lunch with the “Lowland Gunners,” 40 Field Regiment, was how the Desert Rats intended to dispel a few hoary old myths about army chow.\n\nMaybe it was something they put in the ill-famed compo rations, upon which the press stuffed themselves yesterday, but some of the 1,030 members of the Royal Artillery were enthusing about their new habitat.\n\n“It’s the dog’s bollocks,” grinned Gunner Mark Sparrow, aged 20, from Swindon. “It’s great, this is what I joined up for. I like everything about it, the weather, the sense of urgency.”",

    "fullText": "Candidates will have to sit assessments in person unless there are exceptional circumstances, says ACCA\n\nThe world’s largest accounting body is to stop students being allowed to take exams remotely to crack down on a rise in cheating on tests that underpin professional qualifications.\n\nThe Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), which has almost 260,000 members, has said that from March it will stop allowing students to take online exams in all but exceptional circumstances.\n\n“We’re seeing the sophistication of [cheating] systems outpacing what can be put in, [in] terms of safeguards,” Helen Brand, the chief executive of the ACCA, said in an interview with the Financial Times.\n\nRemote testing was introduced during the Covid pandemic to allow students to continue to be able to qualify at a time when lockdowns prevented in-person exam assessment.\n\nIn 2022, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the UK’s accounting and auditing industry regulator, said that cheating in professional exams was a “live” issue at Britain’s biggest companies.\n\nA number of multimillion-dollar fines have been issued to large auditing and accounting companies around the world over cheating scandals in tests.\n\nThe FRC’s investigation found that instances of cheating also included some tier-one auditors, a category comprising the “big four” accountants – KPMG, PwC, Deloitte and EY – along with Mazars, Grant Thornton and BDO.\n\nIn 2022, EY agreed to pay a record $100m (£74m) to US regulators over claims that dozens of its employees cheated on an ethics exam and that the company then misled investigators.\n\nThe ACCA said it had concluded that online tests have become too difficult to police, given the rise in artificial intelligence (AI) tools available to students.\n\nBrand said the ACCA, which has more than half a million students, had worked “intensively” to combat cheating but “people who want to do bad things are probably working at a quicker pace”.\n\nShe added that the rapid rise of technology, led by AI tools, had pushed the issue of cheating to a “tipping point”.\n\nLast year, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), which also trains accountants around the world, said reports of cheating were still increasing.\n\nHowever, the ICAEW still permits some exams to be sat online.\n\n“There are very few high-stakes examinations now that are allowing [remote invigilation],” Brand said.",

    "fullText": "Republican senator Katie Britt also proposes AI companies be criminally liable if they expose minors to harmful ideas\n\nUS senator Bernie Sanders amplified his recent criticism of artificial intelligence on Sunday, explicitly linking the financial ambition of “the richest people in the world” to economic insecurity for millions of Americans – and calling for a potential moratorium on new datacenters.\n\nSanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democratic party, said on CNN’s State of the Union that he was “fearful of a lot” when it came to AI. And the senator called it “the most consequential technology in the history of humanity” that will “transform” the US and the world in ways that had not been fully discussed.\n\n“If there are no jobs and humans won’t be needed for most things, how do people get an income to feed their families, to get healthcare or to pay the rent?” Sanders said. “There’s not been one serious word of discussion in the Congress about that reality.”\n\nDays from being scheduled to help swear New York mayor-elect and democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani into office, Sanders said “the richest people in the world” were pushing the technology. He singled out tech moguls Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Peter Thiel while questioning their motives.\n\n“You think they’re staying up nights worrying about working people and how this technology will impact those people?” Sanders said. “They are not. They are doing it to get richer and even more powerful.”\n\nSanders also pointed to studies that show dependence on AI chatbots for emotional support. “If this trend continues, what does it mean over the years when people are not getting their support, their interaction from other human beings, but from a machine?” he said. “What does that mean to humanity?”\n\nThat theme was taken up separately on State of the Union by Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican senator and co-sponsor of legislation to protect minors from chatbots.\n\nThe proposed measure – the Guardianship Over Artificial Intelligence Relationships (Guard) Act – seeks to ban providing AI companions to minors. It also mandates that AI companions disclose their non-human status and lack of professional credentials. The measure seeks to establish criminal liability if companies make AI companions available to minors that solicit or produce sexually explicit content – or encourage self-harm or violence.\n\nBritt said she had met with parents who have told her “devastating stories about their children where chatbots ultimately, when they kind of peeled everything back, had isolated them from their parents, had talked to them about suicide”.\n\nShe said: “If these AI companies can make the most brilliant machines in the world, they could do us all a service by putting up proper guardrails that did not allow for minors to utilize these things, that also told the user consistently that they are not a physician, they are not a psychiatrist, ‘I am a machine.’”\n\nBritt said AI companies should be held criminally liable if they create spaces where chatbots “are having these types of sensual and sexual relationships with young people or encouraging suicide”.\n\nThe remarks by Sanders and Britt offer a rare convergence of thinking from the left and right on aspects of the issue of governing AI. Sanders said Congress needed “to vigorously study the impact that AI is having on the mental health of our country”.\n\n“I worry very much about kids spending their entire days getting emotional support,” he added. “So we have got to take a hard look on that.” The senator said lawmakers need to be “thinking seriously” about a moratorium on new AI datacenters.\n\n“Frankly, I think you have got to slow this process down,” he said. “It’s not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us, it’s coming, you adapt. What are they talking about? They going to guarantee health care to all people?\n\n“What are they going to do when people have no jobs? What are they going to do, make housing free? So I think we need to take a deep breath, and I think we need to slow this thing down.”",

    "fullText": "PC, Xbox, PlayStation 5; Embark Studios\nThe breakout hit, which has players coming together (or turning on each other) to battle intimidating robots in an apocalyptic future, is worth the hype\n\nArc Raiders is an extraction shooter from Embark Studios – so, a game where you deploy into a map full of other players and do as much shooting and looting as you can before making an escape. This is my first real go at the genre, and it’s excellent. It has smooth, only occasionally cumbersome combat, sound design that scratches the brain just right and robotic enemies that genuinely terrify. And it satisfies my constant need to sift through my inventory and rifle through every drawer.\n\nBut I have to keep my head on a swivel: Arc Raider’s player v player element means I can get jumped for my precious cargo by a malicious rival at any moment. And also, the knowledge that this game was made with the help of generative AI voice acting makes me slightly ashamed of how much I enjoy it. I play every game sheepishly looking over my shoulder (and my character’s) in case someone in-game takes my sought-after blueprint, or someone in real life kicks down my door to call me a hypocrite.\n\nIt’s ever more difficult to avoid AI in everyday life. Arc Raiders has become my guilty pleasure. In it, you play as a raider in post-apocalyptic Italy, living underground but regularly heading topside to scrounge for supplies, after a massive ecological event destroyed human civilisation and strange autonomous robots showed up shortly afterwards to scour the scarred landscape. These ARC can fly overhead, roll around on the ground, or leap extraordinary distances on four mechanical legs. Each is uniquely deadly.\n\nYou are woefully inadequate in a battle against most of Arc Raiders’ enemies, which means you’ll need to scurry around to avoid them, throw noisemakers to distract them, or attack as a team, with either the squad you deployed alongside or other players you convince to join you over chat. All of this is in service of the game’s one true god: loot, which you need in order to perform everything from repairing your weapons to crafting medical supplies to training your pet rooster so he can fetch items for you on the surface. And you can only keep what you successfully escape with, so if you die mid-match or fail to get to an elevator or metro car before the timer runs out, it’s all gone.\n\nThough my first few rounds of Arc Raiders were supremely difficult and punishing (in my third match, I found several pieces of rare loot and was then ruthlessly murdered by a squad all clad in red), Embark has ensured that you can make progress fast. You can upgrade your raider’s mobility, stamina and stealthiness every time you level up, and you can earn experience through playing rounds and successfully extracting. You can recycle things into crafting materials to upgrade your weapons and shield, or sell trinkets to merchants for extra cash that will help you buy better equipment. Even after a bad round, you still get somewhere.\n\nAfter every successful extraction, I want to jump right back in for more. I want more close calls, accidental explosions and terrifying sprints through ruined cities. I want to hurl more expletives over chat so that other squads know I’m in the thick of it, walk past another player blasting A Thousand Miles by Vanessa Carlton through their microphone, usher another half-dozen more people into an elevator hatch before I press the button to close the door at the last second.\n\nArc Raiders isn’t just fun to play. It’s a straight-up shot of serotonin.",

    "fullText": "Gerstner was chair and CEO at a time when the firm was struggling for relevance faced with rivals such as Microsoft\n\nLouis Gerstner, the businessman credited with turning around IBM, has died aged 83, the company announced on Sunday.\n\nGerstner was chair and CEO of IBM from 1993 to 2002, a time when the company was struggling for relevance in the face of competition from rivals such as Microsoft and Sun Microsystems.\n\nAfter becoming the first outsider to run the company, Gerstner abandoned a plan to split IBM, which was known as Big Blue, into a number of autonomous “Baby Blues” that would have focused on specific product areas such as processors or software.\n\nIBM’s current chair and CEO, Arvind Krishna, told staff in an email on Sunday that this decision was key to the company’s survival because “Lou understood that clients didn’t want fragmented technology, they wanted integrated solutions.”\n\n“Lou arrived at IBM at a moment when the company’s future was genuinely uncertain,” he wrote.\n\n“The industry was changing rapidly, our business was under pressure, and there was serious debate about whether IBM should even remain whole. His leadership during that period reshaped the company. Not by looking backward, but by focusing relentlessly on what our clients would need next.”\n\nIBM had dominated the technology sector in the 1960s and 1970s with its mainframe computers. But having developed the IBM personal computer in 1981, the company lost ground in the booming PC market as competitors created “IBM-compatible” machines using Intel processors and Microsoft’s MS-DOS and Windows operating systems.\n\nGerstner startled reporters after arriving at the then loss-making IBM by declaring that “the last thing IBM needs right now is a vision” and insisting the top priority was restore the company to profitability and serve customers better.\n\nOne of his many decisions was to abandon its OS/2 operating system, which it had hoped to use to challenge Microsoft’s dominance of PC operating systems.\n\nGerstner had previously worked as president of American Express and CEO of RJR Nabisco before joining IBM. After he left, he chaired the Carlyle Group.\n\nKrishna said Gerstner had been a “direct” leader who expected preparation and challenged assumptions.\n\n“I have my own memory of Lou from the mid-1990s, at a small town hall with a few hundred people,” he told staff. “What stood out was his intensity and focus. He had an ability to hold the short term and the long term in his head at the same time.\n\n“He pushed hard on delivery, but he was equally focused on innovation, doing work that clients would remember, not just consume.”",

    "fullText": "TAMBACOUNDA, Senegal (AP) — On a blazing afternoon in Senegal, 33-year-old farmer Filly Mangassa heaved peanut plants onto a horse-drawn cart, sending clouds of dust swirling.\n\nTen years ago, he left his village for the capital, Dakar, dreaming of becoming a professor. But the high cost of living and lack of jobs put that dream out of reach.\n\n“Particularly after COVID, companies weren't hiring and prices were rising,” said Mangassa, who has a masters degree in criminology. “I thought: My father and my grandfather were farmers, so why not use that experience and go back to my hometown and try to make a living in agriculture.”\n\nAcross much of Africa, farming has long been seen as low-status work, pushing young people to cities in search of office jobs.\n\n“For my father and some people in my family, they sort of saw me returning to the countryside as a step back,” Mangassa said.\n\nBut that perception is changing. Rising food prices, investments in irrigation and access to new technologies are making agriculture more profitable. Governments and nonprofits now fund programs that teach advanced farming skills and support farmers with equipment, fertilizers, pesticides and seeds.\n\n“When my father saw that I had a clear, thorough business plan, he encouraged me and helped me with the administrative process to acquire land,” Mangassa said.\n\nHe is part of a trend of young Africans leaving cities to try their luck at farming. Mangassa says he makes a profit of around 2 million CFA ($3,500 a year), far above Senegal's average yearly income of about $2,500.\n\nAfrica is the world’s fastest-urbanizing region, with cities growing at an average rate of 3.5% per year. As city populations increase, so does the cost of living.\n\nMedian rents and grocery prices in places like Dakar or Kenya’s capital of Nairobi are approaching those of major European cities, despite median salaries being significantly lower, according to the World Bank.\n\nMeanwhile, between 10 and 12 million young Africans enter the job market each year while only about 3 million formal jobs are created, according to the African Development Bank.\n\n“A lot of my friends who graduated at the same time as me now work as motorcycle taxi drivers and barely make a living,” Mangassa said.\n\nHelping young farmers acquire land\n\nMangassa now owns a 32-acre farm where he grows peanuts, corn, vegetables and fruit. He received some funding to buy land from a World Food Program initiative helping young Africans start careers in agriculture.\n\nLaunched in 2023 and set to run through early 2027, it has supported around 380,000 people in launching agricultural businesses.\n\nIt works with local governments to allow young farmers to acquire land — often a challenge because of complex ownership systems and young people's difficulty in obtaining loans because they are seen as high risk.\n\nIn Senegal, the program has supported over 61,000 people, with more than 80% launching farms, according to WFP. It also operates in Ghana, Nigeria, Mozambique, Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya and Tanzania.\n\n“Our surveys show three main barriers for young people entering agriculture: limited access to land, financing and inputs; a lack of practical skills; and tough market conditions — knowing when to sell, how to add value and how to market their products,” said WFP’s country director for Senegal, Pierre Lucas.\n\nSenegal, like many African countries, is plagued by food insecurity that has been exacerbated by donors' funding cuts and worsening climate conditions.\n\nThe region also is recovering from the colonial era, said Ibrahima Hathie, an agricultural economist at the Senegal-based Prospective Agricultural and Rural Initiative think tank.\n\n“In Senegal for example, farmers were pressured to grow groundnuts to be sold in France instead of food crops,\" Hathie said.\n\nScarce arable land and soil degradation further constrain food production.\n\nBut now, many young farmers are shifting to high-value crops and have better technology, so production is increasing, Hathie said, predicting that as more locally produced food enters markets, staple prices could fall.\n\nFarming becomes an alternative to migration\n\nSenegal is a main departure point for migrants attempting to reach Europe via the deadly Atlantic route. Authorities see agriculture as one way to create jobs to keep young people at home, launching campaigns in rural areas most affected by migration.\n\n“I’m convinced that the only sector that can create the hundreds of thousands of jobs young people in Africa need is agriculture and livestock,” Senegal’s agriculture minister, Mabouba Diagne, told reporters in October.\n\nAdama Sane, 24, once dreamed of reaching Europe but didn't have money to pay smugglers. He had moved to Dakar in 2020 but struggled to make ends meet as a construction worker. Then he heard about the WFP initiative.\n\n“In a sense, discovering agriculture saved my life,” Sane said. “If I had stayed in my construction job, I would have tried crossing the ocean sooner or later.”\n\nHe now raises poultry and cultivates peppers on his five-acre farm in his village.\n\n“I am still far from where I want to be with my business, but at least I am saving a lot of money compared to the city, and life is less stressful,” Sane said. “A lot of young people think that being a farmer is a ‘small job,’ but there is starting to be a public awakening that agriculture can be the key to development in Senegal.\"\n\nThree other potential migrants are now working for Mangassa.\n\nMamadou Camara, 22, Issa Traoré, 22, and Madassa Kebe, 23, had been living in Mali's capital, Bamako, struggling to find work. Their families had helped them raise money for the Atlantic journey to Europe via Guinea-Bissau, but they said a smuggler there disappeared with it.\n\nThey decided to return home through Senegal, where they met Mangassa.\n\n“I empathized with them because I know what it’s like to work hard and still not make ends meet while your family depends on you,” Mangassa said. “I wanted to show them that there are opportunities for young people here.”\n\nFor more on Africa and development: https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse\n\nThe Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

    "description": "Many people asked me for money when my company made a million dollars. I often gave in, but it was never enough — until I set boundaries.",
    "fullText": "When I finally made $1 million, my friends and family expected me to share my wealth.\n\nI lost long-term friendships because money came between us.\n\nThrough therapy, I learned I don't have to show up for people financially.\n\nI'm a first-generation American who grew up in an immigrant household where finances were rarely discussed. I knew my mother and stepfather worked hard, sometimes with multiple jobs, but I was not aware of the specifics of their debt, savings, salaries, or how they managed their finances.\n\nWhen I was 14, my parents found religion, and it changed the trajectory of our lives. When I told my parents I didn't want to go to seminary and become a pastor, they kicked me out of their home when I was 17 years old.\n\nAt 18, I earned my commercial driver's license and started making money with my first business. That's when people started asking me for money, and the requests only intensified when I became a millionaire years later.\n\nI was working as a delivery driver for a bakery when I got the opportunity to start my first business, which involved deliveries. That business made a lot of money quickly.\n\nWhen my family and some friends saw how well the business was doing, they paid more attention to me. I thought those who'd been cold to me were coming around, but instead they asked for loans or for me to give them money outright.\n\nIn my 20s, I wasn't in a position to give away money, as I had started a family and bills to pay. That changed further down the line.\n\nI eventually sold my delivery company and started an online business because I wanted to work from anywhere.\n\nI've been building my online business since 2011, and it's only grown.\n\nIn 2023, I achieved a new level of financial success by surpassing the $1 million mark in cash collected. I set a goal for myself and made my first million.\n\nMy family, even those still living in Kenya, where my mom is from, and friends started to take notice of how well I was doing financially. I wasn't broadcasting how much money I was making, but those close to me could see the signs, such as upgrading our living situation, getting a new car, and paying for meals.\n\nThe family initially requested money slowly, but the requests became more frequent, and some became increasingly demanding. My close friends at the time asked for money to borrow, and they expected me to pay for everything when we went out for men's nights.\n\nThe requests for money came from everywhere, and even when I did decide to give family and friends some money, it was never seen as enough. I was often told I was being greedy.\n\nI spent a long time feeling like my only value was to earn money to give to others.\n\nIt took me years of feeling obligated to help family and friends before I woke up. I felt blessed to have created some wealth and believed it was my duty to help those in my life who were still struggling, even when I knew I shouldn't.\n\nTherapy helped me see that my low self-worth and feelings of abandonment were why I let people take advantage of me. Therapy helped me see that I'm more than what I could do for people financially.\n\nI had to cut off two of my best friends at the time because of issues with money. It hurt my soul to let go of friendships and cut off family, but I eventually understood it was the best decision for my mental health and financial future.\n\nAfter lots of therapy, I've consistently turned down family members who have asked for money more times than I can count. I've set boundaries, and I'll only give someone money when I feel comfortable about doing it.\n\nI've let go of the feeling of obligation and remind myself of the lesson I learned long ago: I'm responsible for my financial future and need to be wise with my money.\n\nOver the past 24 years, making a million dollars and building a successful business have taught me about the difference between genuine and superficial relationships. And that lesson has been priceless.",

    "fullText": "If you have $2 million in retirement savings, congratulations. That’s well above the $1.26 million that Americans, according to Northwestern Mutual, believe is needed to retire comfortably. (1)\n\nAt this point, you have probably overcome the challenge of saving enough. Now, your next mission is wealth preservation. Higher taxes and the wrong lifestyle choices can quickly erode what seems like a huge treasure trove.\n\nShifting your perspective from building wealth to protecting it isn’t easy. But the journey could be less treacherous if you avoid these five common money traps that high-net-worth individuals sometimes fall into.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nIf you follow the 4% rule, $2 million in retirement savings would give you $80,000 a year, adjusted for inflation. That could either be too much or too little, depending on where you live and how much you spend.\n\nLifestyle inflation — where your spending habits change with the size of your portfolio and paycheck — is a real risk. It’s perhaps one of the reasons why only 32% of American millionaires, according to Northwestern Mutual, consider themselves “wealthy.” (2)\n\nOf these millionaires, 70% who do not work with a financial advisor said they know how much money they need to retire comfortably. In other words, many high-net-worth individuals haven’t taken the time to plan their retirement budget and lifestyle needs.\n\nDon’t fall into the same trap. Consider hiring a financial advisor to help you craft a robust budget that you can stick to easily. While $2 million sounds like a lot, it can quickly disappear and might not be enough for everyone.\n\nIf much of your wealth is in tax-advantaged retirement accounts such as 401(k) plans and IRAs, you need to prepare for the tax consequences of making withdrawals in retirement.\n\nLess than half (49%) of millionaires without a financial advisor told Northwestern Mutual they consider how much taxes could eat into their retirement savings. Without a proper forecast of these taxes and a strategic plan to minimize taxes, you end up with a thinner-than-expected safety net in retirement.",

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nIf you’re looking to build real core strength, the kind that supports your spine, improves your compound movements, enhances posture and powers everyday movement, it’s time to focus on your deep core muscles while standing tall.\n\nAccording to Pvolve Head Trainer Dani Coleman (also known for training Jennifer Aniston), your core is far more than just your abs. “It’s 35+ muscles that stabilise, twist and support every movement you make,” she explains. “That’s why it makes sense to train your core with as much variety and functionality as possible.”\n\nSure, planks and crunches are very much the go-to core staples, but in a recent Instagram workout, Coleman demonstrates that you can build serious deep-core strength from a standing position. The best part? It’s easy to slot these moves into your day without needing much floor space (or a gym).\n\nThis four-move workout from Coleman requires just a single dumbbell, kettlebell, or even a heavy water bottle. All in all, it takes about eight minutes from start to finish, making it ideal as a finisher, warm-up, or quick standalone session.\n\nColeman doesn’t specify reps in her Instagram video, but a simple structure is: 50 seconds on, 10 seconds off. Repeat the circuit twice.\n\nPallof Press: An anti-rotation essential that teaches your core to resist twisting, which is key for protecting your spine. It builds trunk stability, reinforces proper alignment and strengthens the deep muscles that keep you steady as you move.\n\nGolf Swing: A controlled rotational movement that targets the obliques while improving mobility through the spine and hips. It also boosts coordination – useful for anything that involves reaching, throwing, or twisting.\n\nStep back to Hinge: This combination move fires up your core while challenging balance and hip mobility. It encourages stability as you move through a hinge pattern, helping you generate more strength and control in everyday tasks.\n\nStanding Deadbug: A smart standing variation of the classic deadbug. It strengthens the stabilisers that support your spine and improves coordination between your upper and lower body.\n\nStanding core exercises target the deep muscles we often overlook - including the transverse abdominis, obliques and pelvic floor, while keeping you upright and functional. Unlike traditional crunches, they train your core the way you use it most: standing, moving, twisting, lifting and reaching.\n\nAs Coleman explains, this “helps you perform daily tasks more easily and with more confidence” - and ultimately proves that core strength isn’t just aesthetic. It’s the foundation of a strong, resilient body.",

    "fullText": "A Ph.D. student affirmed that electric vehicles are better for the environment than cars with internal combustion engines.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, even with the energy required to manufacture a lithium battery, the emissions associated with EVs over a lifetime are lower than those from a gas-powered car.\n\nTikToker Rosh (@all_about_climate), a student with degrees in both Earth and climate science, posted a response to a common myth about EVs. In the video, Rosh showed a clip of someone who said the energy used to mine lithium for EV batteries has a greater environmental impact than gas-powered cars.\n\nWhile Rosh said there are some environmental consequences from EV battery production, the TikToker rejected the idea that internal combustion engines are better for the planet.\n\nIn the video, Rosh presented a graph from Generation Investment Management which showed that other metals were mined significantly more than lithium in 2022. For example, about 1.3 million kilotonnes of iron were mined compared to 130 kilotonnes of lithium.\n\n\"The idea that it's worse or even comparable to what we are currently doing to maintain the fossil fuel status quo is completely wrong,\" Rosh said.\n\nThe EPA said the planet-friendly vehicles have a smaller carbon footprint than their gas counterparts because they have zero tailpipe emissions. In fact, a new study found that EVs zero out their carbon footprint in just two years on the road.\n\nThe transportation sector is the largest source of air pollution in the country. Switching to an EV can keep pollution out of the atmosphere and help you avoid paying for maintenance and high gas prices.\n\nHundreds of TikTok users responded to Rosh's video. Many commenters agreed with Rosh's defense of EVs and the manufacturing of lithium batteries.\n\n\"The oil guy in the video reminds me of a tobacco company owner saying smoking is good,\" one commenter quipped.\n\nDo you think EVs charge too slowly?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"[You] hear that all the time and it is 100% wrong,\" another commenter said. \"Basically propaganda from the oil industry.

    "description": "Dr. Oz's remarks may get written off as a joke, but there is nothing funny about the undercurrent of what his words actually mean.",
    "fullText": "“We’ve dropped (the price of) the infertility drugs to make lots of Trump babies, I’m hoping by the midterms.” That bizarre remark was made recently by Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nAfter four years of the first Trump administration and nearly one year into the second, many of us have become desensitized to this kind of commentary – but not Black women. We know the quiet part spoken out loud when we hear it.\n\nDr. Oz’s remarks may get written off as a joke, but there is nothing funny about the undercurrent of what his words actually mean. This administration will stop at nothing to ensure the political dominance of White people in this country.\n\n“Trump babies” born ahead of the midterm elections in 2026 won’t vote until 2044, but after decades of listening to phrases like “welfare queens,” we know a dog whistle when we hear one. To understand this moment, it helps to look across generations.\n\nMore than 60 years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act and the Immigration and Nationality Act. One cannot underestimate the impact of that generation’s monumental moment on what’s happening today.\n\nThis seminal 1965 pair of laws “democratized the idea of who could be an American” and who could vote, as recently reported by The New Yorker writer Jelani Cobb.\n\nOpinion: Americans are shifting away from wanting kids. I'm worried for my generation.\n\nTwenty years from now, the White population in America will fall below 50%. Non-White births already exceed those of White Americans, and non-White children under age 15 already outnumber White children.\n\nThat reality should usher in a more inclusive democracy. Instead, White supremacists see it as an existential threat.\n\nThe MAGA movement intends to preserve power at all costs. Its four-part plan for stopping this demographic tsunami includes voter suppression, undermining reproductive justice, drastically reducing the number of non-White children who grow up to be voters through targeted deportations and incentivizing U.S. births among “traditional families.”\n\nFirst is the strategic disenfranchisement of Black and Latino voters by gutting the Voting Rights Act, culling us from voter lists and gerrymandering the elimination of congressional seats representing Black and Brown constituencies.\n\nSecond is pricing out low-income parents from having the economic and reproductive autonomy to choose their family sizes. The cost to raise a U.S. child born in 2015 to age 18 is estimated to be $320,000, and with families of color facing disproportionate levels of poverty, slashing safety net programs will only make it harder for people in our communities to have children.\n\nIn fact, recent state polling from In Our Own Voice found that financial insecurity is a top concern among Black adults as to why they are not growing their families. This will only be exacerbated as federal budget cuts and inflation make basic necessities like childcare, shelter and nutrition increasingly out of reach.\n\nAt the same time, the poor quality of care in our health system, underscored by the recent experiences of two Black women, Karrie Jones in Texas and Mercedes Wells in Indiana, both of whom were dismissed while in active labor, shows how dangerous and unequal the path to parenthood has become.\n\nSlashing Medicaid for millions will cripple critical care for more than a quarter of Black and Latina women, more than half of Black girls and, in a shift too significant to ignore, two-thirds of Black births.\n\nThird, we are witnessing our government’s brutal kidnappings and deportations of Black and Brown immigrants of reproductive age and their children. Along with attacking birthright citizenship, limiting international student visas and admitting only White Afrikaners as refugees, these nativist policies set the stage for shrinking pathways for America’s non-White population.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app? Download it for free from your app store.\n\nAnd fourth, White families must have more babies. While the administration’s early ideas – a $1,000 “baby bonus” and medals for mothers of six – may sound harmless, they point to the concerning rise of America’s pronatalism movement.\n\nWith unmistakable echoes of eugenics, its White, religious, conservative champions are pushing for more births among married, heterosexual couples and for children engineered for high intelligence and other so-called desirable traits.\n\nIn this context, the push for a new generation of “Trump babies” fits squarely within a broader strategy to dictate who gets to be born, who gets to stay and who ultimately gets to participate in American democracy.\n\nOpinion: Liberals aren't having kids, conservatives are. That matters.\n\nIt’s long past time for the opposition to stop reacting to executive orders, shutdowns and political theater and start listening to Black women. The “Trump babies” remark and ideology foreshadow a weakened and deeply unequal democracy.\n\nSo let’s call this what it is: a generational war by those clinging to power to “Make America Great Again” by preserving White dominance of American political, economic and cultural life; dramatically reducing Black and Latinobirths andsuffrage;and neutralizing a demographic tipping point that will permanently end White majority in the United States.\n\nBecause this is a generational strategy, it demands a generational response – one rooted in truth, organized power and an unwavering commitment to the dignity, agency and futures of Black, Brown and immigrant communities.\n\nRegina Davis Moss, a public health expert and author with a specialty in Black maternal health, is president and CEO of In Our Own Voice: National Black Women’s Reproductive Justice Agenda.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our USA TODAY columnists and other writers on the Opinion front page, on X, formerly Twitter, @usatodayopinion and in our Opinion newsletter.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: 'Trump babies' reveal GOP's long game: Voter suppression | Opinion",

They have to pick on the one that actually helps people, that's actually made money for the average person, that is actually supporting our war fighters,\" Karp said on CNBC. (It should be noted that some would debate that characterization; Palantir is often criticized for its work with the US government on surveillance and immigration enforcement.)\n\n\"These people, they claim to be ethical,\" Karp continued, adding that \"they're actually shorting one of the great businesses of the world.\"\n\nSam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, also recently expressed his discontent with those who are skeptical about his firm's valuation. While his company is private, Altman said he sometimes wishes it were public so that he could take it to short sellers.\n\n\"There are not many times I want to be a public company, but one of the rare times that it's appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous, 'OpenAI is about to go out of business,'\" Altman told the Bg2 Pod in October. \"I would love to tell them they could just short the stock, and I would love to see them get burned on that.\"\n\nAnd while he hasn't been as outspoken about short-sellers per se, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang responded to AI bubble concerns during the firm's earnings call in November, saying \"there's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\" and \"from our vantage point, we see something very different.\"\n\nThese rising titans of the AI era are the latest business moguls to direct their ire at short sellers. The distaste for investors who put their money on the line to bet that a company's shares will decline is a decadeslong tradition. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has famously battled investors who have bet against the electric vehicle maker. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen has called the practice \"un-American.\" The pushback it's understandable: executives put a massive amount of work into building and running their companies, and when someone bets against them, it can feel personal.\n\nHowever, CEOs like Karp need to understand that attracting the attention of shorts is part of the natural life cycle of a company and a healthy market mechanism that allows a range of views to compete. One could even argue that Karp should take pride in the fact that he's grown his company to a size that draws such fervent skeptics. In a sense, it's a badge of honor. He's made it to the big leagues.\n\nInvesting in a company you believe in is straightforward: simply buy the stock. Betting against a company by shorting its stock, on the other hand, is a bit more complex. To do it, an investor borrows shares from their brokerage and agrees to return them by a specified date. The investor then sells the borrowed shares in the open market. When it's time to return the shares to the lender, the investor purchases the agreed-upon amount at the prevailing market price. If the price of the stock falls within that time, the short-seller can then buy back the shares at a lower price, earning a profit. If they got it wrong and the company's stock is higher, well, they've lost money. For example, if you think a company's stock is overvalued at $100 a share, you can borrow 10 shares from a broker for a total value of $1,000. You agree to give the shares back at the end of the month. On the day the deadline hits, if the stock has fallen to $50 a share, you buy up the amount you need to return and pocket a tidy $500 gain. But if that stock were to get hot instead, and rises to $300 a share, you're out $2,000 — a nasty hit. It goes without saying that short-selling can be extremely risky. While a long investor can lose all of their money, a short-seller can, in theory, lose infinite sums.\n\nIt's especially tricky to short small companies. Since there are fewer investors buying and selling their shares, even small amounts of buying can cause the price to rise dramatically. This can create problems for short sellers if they suddenly need to return the shares to their lender, a process known as covering their position. If the supply of shares is low and demand suddenly increases, it can drive the price of a stock through the roof, cutting the short seller even deeper. It's a phenomenon known as a short squeeze, and it's what famously happened to short sellers Gabe Plotkin and Andrew Left during the GameStop saga.\n\n\"Short sellers absolutely want to make sure they have plenty of liquidity, and so that's why it's so dangerous to short something that's pretty small,\" said Ryan Kelley, the chief investment officer at Hennessy Funds, which manages around $4 billion.\n\nDerivatives markets, more complex financial products that allow for even more exotic bets on the direction of a stock, also become larger when a stock becomes more prominent, thereby providing the opportunity for more people to bet against a company. After all, to short a stock, you need an investor to lend shares to you.\n\n\"The reality is, as companies get bigger, the derivatives market in companies grows. And as the derivatives market grows, there's more folks that will be taking positions,\" said Maurits Pot, the founder of Tema ETFs, which manages around $1 billion after launching in 2023.\n\nSo, the fact that Palantir is drawing short-sellers is, in a way, a badge of honor for Karp. When you get as big as Palantir — which is up 1,720% since its IPO in October 2020 — short bets are going to happen. Sure, some of these increased bets are because there are more people who think the company is on the wrong path, but a lot of times, short interest can increase for more technical reasons — many of them to do with the size of the company. When a company grows, so does the variety of opinions on its stock performance. And that's OK.\n\nThere are several reasons shorting is a necessary component of a robust market.\n\nFirst, short-sellers act as a check, helping to call out companies for a range of bad behaviors, from corporate malfeasance to incompetent management. On the extreme end, short sellers have used research, data analysis, and information gathering to expose cases of serious fraud, accounting tricks, and blatant deception. For example, fraudulent behavior at the pharmaceutical company Valeant was exposed in 2015 when short-sellers sounded the alarm about the firm. On the more quotidian side, investors betting against a company have called out executives and management teams for taking a company in the wrong direction. Some individuals will do it publicly, sharing their thesis for why a stock is overvalued. But since the amount of short interest can be tracked, a rising number of quieter short bets can make investors and regulators more aware of the risks associated with a particular firm. In these instances, short sellers have a financial interest in seeing the stock go down, but they are also trying to serve the public interest.\n\n\"It's a possibility that people can be adamantly against the way you're running a business,\" Kelley said, \"and it should be that they're able to actually put their money where their mouth is — in other words, short the stock and be vocal about it.\"\n\nIn other cases, short sellers may not think the company itself is doing anything egregious, but rather that other investors in the market are overreacting. Tesla's stock has often traded at nosebleed valuations due to its fanatical investor following, drawing short interest simply because it has traded above its fundamentals at times.\n\nOf course, there are bad actors — some short sellers have been charged with taking a short position on a stock and then drumming up negative headlines about the company to send its share price tumbling, sometimes coordinating with other short sellers. In other words, not simply talking their book, but being disingenuous or lying. These more questionable motivations make short sellers an easy target, and are likely what raised Karp's rankles. But the notion that short-selling in and of itself is harmful is not fair, Pot said.\n\n\"The idea that you can't be shorting, I think that's — I wouldn't say it's anti-competitive — but it impedes the natural impulse of the market, which is that there are companies that are shorted for good reason,\" Pot said.\n\n\"Short selling is core to the market,\" Pot continued, \"and I think as long as short selling doesn't become a coordinated, speculative attack, I think it's part of the regular functioning of capital markets.\"\n\nIn this same vein, short sellers can temper the euphoria in bubble periods. When the market is ripping and Wall Street strategists are loath to issue a downbeat, bearish forecast, it can be helpful to hear arguments for why a standout stock or a particularly hot market theme has gone too far. And because losses can be infinite for short sellers, putting their money where their mouth is tells you about their degree of conviction. It's essentially what Michael Burry — who gained fame shorting the housing market leading up to the 2008 crash — did a few weeks ago, when he questioned the assumed rate of depreciation on GPUs, arguing that they'll become obsolete in just a couple of years. With this argument now at the top of investors' minds, you might argue that stocks are more efficiently priced.\n\nAnother important role that short sellers play is providing liquidity in the market. While an investor would ordinarily hold their shares, lending them to a short-seller to auction off to the market allows these shares to continue circulating through the system. And when they eventually have to cover their positions and repurchase their shares, they provide exit liquidity to people looking to sell. Higher liquidity levels enable investors to enter and exit positions more quickly and at closer proximity to the market price.\n\nExecutives like Karp shouldn't take short-selling to heart. Instead, they should recognize its important market function, and wear it as a feather in their cap — a sign that their company is maturing into adulthood.\n\nWilliam Edwards is a senior investing reporter at Business Insider primarily covering the US stock market and the broader economy.",

    "description": "For Wall Streeters, finding the time to shop for presents can be tough.",
    "fullText": "Work schedules don't always have much sympathy for holiday plans — especially the notoriously grueling hours of the finance industry.\n\nWhen it comes to carving out time for gifting, some Wall Streeters opt to outsource the task, while others shop at convenient stores close to, or even within, their offices.\n\n\"This time of year, time seems to move a little bit faster,\" said Elisabeth Brown, the director of US membership at luxury travel and lifestyle concierge company Knightsbridge Circle.\n\nBrown said that gift help is a popular service among members, and that Knightsbridge Circle will suggest, buy, and even deliver items. Members devote time to talking about their preferences, and later to approving purchases, but otherwise pass off the responsibility.\n\nOther finance employees turn to personal shoppers for help. David Thielebuele, the fashion director of ready-to-wear at Bloomingdale's, said in an email that people turn to personal shoppers for a mix of \"convenience and expertise,\" especially during the end-of-year crunch. The personal shopping team can refine lists, buy items, and build event wardrobes.\n\n\"The real challenge is decision fatigue,\" Thielebuele said. Many clients can only devote fragmented chunks of time to gifting, he added, compounding the issue.\n\nFor those who do handle the shopping on their own, though, stores near the office can offer an easy solution. Jeremy Balrup, who covers sales and analytics for Bloomberg's enterprise data business and has worked in finance for around a decade, said he often stops by department stores near his office in Midtown Manhattan to buy gifts. If he's buying a sweater, he said he'll visit the J. Press store in Grand Central.\n\nThose who work at Goldman Sachs might not even have to leave the office to pick up gifts. The firm hosts a holiday market in New York, London, and Dallas offices, featuring graduates of its 10,000 Small Businesses program. Around 80 vendors sold their items between the fairs, and Goldman's global head of corporate engagement, Asahi Pompey, called it \"one of the most joyful days on our calendar.\"\n\nFor some, the holiday commitment goes beyond shopping alongside colleagues.\n\nIn a Business Insider survey about Wall Street gifting, about 40% of the respondents who said they work in finance said they were considering buying their colleagues presents. The most popular items to get them were wine or liquor, according to the unscientific survey, and Balrup said that a nice bottle is always a hit in his office's white elephant game.\n\nEileen Rizzo, the CEO of Zachys Wine and Liquor, said that her company's analytics show that people with interests in banking and investment are among the most active audience segments, and that New York is the most active market. Champagne is always hugely popular around the holidays, and Italian and Bordeaux wines are also highly requested, she said. Zachys' top customers tend to spend around $900 per order.\n\nAnd when it comes to what Wall Streeters want for themselves? Watches seem to be all the rage.",

    "fullText": "It's been the first full year of Starbucks' CEO Brian Niccol's \"Back to Starbucks\" mission. So, how did it go?\n\nWell, let's not beat around the bush: From a shareholder's perspective, pretty meh. By late December, Starbucks' stock had declined by more than 5% over the past year, compared to the broader stock market, which had increased by more than 16%.\n\nBut that's not what counts most with me, a consumer of Starbucks coffee (and its free public bathrooms).\n\nNiccol's big vision was a return to Starbucks' glory days as a destination coffee shop where people wanted to sit and stay while sipping a drink — not a drive-thru for sugar syrup slop drinks ordered by phone.\n\nI fully welcome a few of the changes. Others, not so much.\n\nFor one thing, he axed 13 unpopular and complicated drinks from the menu. Goodbye to Caramel Ribbon Crunch Crème Frappuccino and farewell to Royal English Breakfast Latte. I never even knew you existed.\n\nAnother change I welcomed: a plan to offer more late-afternoon snacks, like the \"appertivo\" menu in some of the European Starbucks. Hey, I love an afternoon snack! To test out Niccol's new plans, I headed out to a nearby Starbucks in the afternoon and had a very pleasant treat of something savory and something sweet. The newish falafel wrap was a hit, in my mind. I'd look forward to more afternoon-targeted items.\n\nOne last change that is a long time coming: finally charging people more for extra syrups and powder add-ons. I don't want my plain coffee subsidizing you sickos out there who ask for it with six scoops of matcha powder or eight pumps of caramel syrup. Niccol seemed to have learned from his time as Chipotle CEO that we should all understand that guac is extra.\n\nBut there was one big change that I think is a stinker: mandating that baristas doodle or write a cutesy message on the cups.\n\nAlthough some baristas don't mind doing it — or even enjoy it! — I found plenty of Starbucks employees and customers talking online who thought the new policy was onerous and silly.\n\nA Starbucks spokeswoman told me that writing on the cups was part of creating a warm environment: \"We believe in the power of genuine human connection — and we know that even the smallest gesture, like a handwritten note on a cup, can spark joy for our customers and partners [employees] alike.\"\n\nWell, I contend that — especially when stories get busy — no one wants to waste time making smiley faces on cups — and no customers want to wait, either. But more than anything, I find this forced whimsy to be cloyingly saccharine (and I say this as a lifelong Sweet'n Low user).\n\nFor 2026? I'd just like to see a return of the triangle-shaped espresso brownies.",

    "description": "Investors at 18 VC firms shared where they're investing, what they think is overhyped, and how they expect the tech market to shift in 2026.",
    "fullText": "If January is for resolutions, it's also for predictions — and in 2026, venture capital is placing its bets on tiny teams, personal agents, and a reckoning for wildly overpriced tech startups.\n\nIn recent years, companies dumped money into generative artificial intelligence tools that promised to help them work smarter and faster. The spending spree fattened revenue for companies selling copilots for coding, customer service, sales, and search — and sent their valuations soaring.\n\nNow investors say the next phase is payback. Enterprises will demand measurable returns to keep spending, and the AI companies that can't prove value may find their software renewals harder, fundraising tougher, and exits further away. As Venky Ganesan, a partner at Menlo Ventures, put it: \"2026 is the 'show me the money' year for AI.\"\n\nBusiness Insider asked investors at 18 venture capital firms, including Khosla Ventures, CapitalG, Sapphire Ventures, and Greycroft to share their predictions for what's next: where they're investing, what they think is overhyped, and how they expect the market to shift in the year ahead.\n\nFrom IPOs to ROI, these are the tech trends to watch in 2026, according to venture capitalists.\n\nCathy Gao, partner at Sapphire Ventures: We will start treating AI agents like junior staff with job titles, budgets, and spending limits. Once an agent can issue a refund or buy inventory, it stops being a tool and becomes a worker. This flips the business model from paying for access to paying for work completed, like tickets resolved or dollars recovered.\n\nLindsey Li, investor at Bessemer Venture Partners: In 2026, many companies will realize that the AI-written code they've produced over the last two years is often inconsistent, hard to understand, and difficult to maintain. At the same time, a new class of agents will emerge that specialize in debugging, refactoring, and cleaning up large codebases, effectively serving as automated maintainers.\n\nTomasz Tunguz, founder and general partner of Theory Ventures: The typical white collar worker will manage 50 agents daily in 2 years.\n\nBrian Bustamante-Nicholson, partner at Greycroft: Within the consumer space, we've been seeing companies do more with less for last four years. Remote work liberated companies to hire 10x employees all over the world and that naturally resulted in smaller, more efficient teams. Now we're seeing AI impact areas like creative and digital marketing, enabling companies to rely less on both internal hires and agencies to produce campaigns. We expect this trend will only accelerate into 2026, and consumer companies will continue to increase their runways.\n\nJared Heyman, managing partner at Rebel Fund: The trend towards startups becoming increasingly capital efficient is undeniable. Startups are using AI to build AI that other startups use to build more AI — and the cycle continues. As a result, small teams can build way more, way faster, than they could even a few months ago. In 2026, we'll see very small teams achieve extreme revenue growth — perhaps even over $100 million of ARR with just a few cofounders and employees.\n\nManthan Shah, head of US investments at WestBridge Capital: Humans communicate primarily through voice, and that creates a massive opportunity for AI systems that can speak, listen, and interact in a human way. We are still at the very beginning of this shift, but I expect to see a surge in both horizontal and deeply vertical voice-driven applications that effectively replicate human interaction and unlock entirely new business models. Once voice becomes a true platform, it will open the door for a new generation of companies that build products that behave less like software and more like another person in the room.\n\nSimon Wu, partner at Cathay Innovation: If the last two years were dominated by text-based LLMs, 2026 is when enterprises finally move to AI that can listen and see. Voice AI becomes the default for customer support, sales, and service workflows, while video AI emerges as critical infrastructure for robotics, field operations, and enterprise analytics. Expect at least one breakout company to raise a major round in 2026 and position \"multimodal intelligence\" — especially voice and video comprehension — as its core differentiator.\n\nVenky Ganesan, partner at Menlo Ventures: 2026 is the \"show me the money\" year for AI. Enterprises will need to see real ROI in their spend, and companies need to see meaningful increases in productivity growth to keep the AI spend and infrastructure going. Given some of the aggressive spend in AI, you will see a major AI company go bankrupt or have severe financial issues.\n\nMedha Agarwal, general partner at Defy.vc: 2026 will be the year AI spending meets ROI reality. Enterprises will demand hard returns from AI investments, and many pilots will be delayed, scaled back, or cancelled if value doesn't materialize.\n\nRob Biederman, managing Partner at Asymmetric Capital Partners: In 2026, the gap between AI products with tangible, well-defined ROI and those that are perceived as nice-to-have will widen and define outcomes for companies in a way that's been lost during the mania of the last few years. We feel strongly that in 2026 corporate boards and executive teams will begin focusing on payback from AI investment as costs continue to rise with less clear business impact.\n\nRajeev Dham, partner at Sapphire Ventures: In 2026, accounting and finance will become among the fastest-growing categories in enterprise AI. The pressure on companies to modernize the stack creates the perfect demand environment — yet unlike legal, the market still lacks a \"Harvey for finance.\" I believe this vacuum represents one of the largest untapped enterprise AI opportunities.\n\nLindsey Li, investor at Bessemer Venture Partners: Excel and financial spreadsheets become the next major AI breakout vertical. After code generation and customer support, we expect finance workflows particularly in Excel to see the next wave of real AI adoption. Financial modeling and reporting are structured but still largely manual, making them well suited for AI to help build models, clean and organize data, and surface key insights.\n\nSheena Jindal, founder and managing partner at Sugar Free Capital: Outsized technical depth is going to be critical for founders. The acquihire frenzy of 2025 has shown us that premium prices are paid for exceptional founders. As the tech giants remain active with acquisitions, earlier exits via acquihires and M&A will continue to be a new driver of IRR for pre-seed and seed firms who typically have years to wait before DPI.\n\nSarah Du, investor at Uncork Capital: Founders will continue to skew younger than in the pre-AI era. Given the rapid pace of evolution in the space, even experienced founders are learning alongside first-time founders. Speed now matters more than tenure, and younger founders are on a more level playing field than before.\n\nEthan Choi, partner at Khosla Ventures: We'll have the first of dramatic anti-AI protests in certain countries with white collar workers, not blue collar workers, demanding job security in the face of AI disruption.\n\nTamara Steffens, managing director at Thomson Reuters Ventures: The IPO window will continue to open in 2026, fueled by pressure from early investors and improved market stability.\n\nBrian Bustamante-Nicholson, partner at Greycroft: The backlog of companies looking to go public is very healthy. In our view, the administration will continue to capitulate on economic policies that have adversely impacted the US economy and created uncertainty in the capital markets. A few marquee, bellwether IPOs frequently mentioned, like SpaceX, could open the gates and create some urgency with strategics to acquire versus wait as IPOs prove a viable path to liquidity.\n\nTomasz Tunguz, founder and general partner of Theory Ventures: We think M&A continues to accelerate especially with the demand for AI talent at a premium. This will increase the cadence of acquihires as well as multibillion-dollar acquisitions.\n\nSarah Du, investor at Uncork Capital: Big tech and frontier labs will keep scooping up teams to secure AI talent. Some founders may intentionally build with this in mind — optimizing for technical breakthroughs and acquisition potential rather than long-term independence.\n\nDeedy Das, partner at Menlo Ventures: A lot of AI valuations will take a markdown, squeezing compensation for AI researchers at tier-1 startups. The best AI companies will continue to succeed but maybe not at the extent that they'd thought.\n\nEthan Choi, partner at Khosla Ventures: We are seeing even more egregious valuations and behavior from founders and investors relative to ZIRP times and I have a hard time seeing how we can sustain these kinds of private valuations without commensurate explosive revenue materializing.\n\nNnamdi Okike, cofounder and managing partner, 645 Ventures: Both public and private investors will regain discipline and apply a much stricter lens to their AI investments. While the correction will begin with hyperscalers and foundation model companies, it will eventually impact the entire AI stack, including application companies. This will have a ripple effect across the tech markets. The receding tide will result in reduced valuations in 2027 in both public and private markets.\n\nShawn Carolan, partner at Menlo Ventures: 2026 will see AI agents autonomously creep into your entire digital life — not just ordering lunch, but negotiating better rates on your behalf, proactively canceling services you've stopped using, and handling complex multi-step tasks like planning and booking trips. The question won't be \"Can AI book a restaurant?\" but, \"How much of my life do I want AI to control?\"\n\nMedha Agarwal, general partner at Defy.vc: Consumer AI crosses a cultural threshold in 2026. AI companionship becomes socially acceptable. People will post about their AI assistants, talk openly about their AI friends, and integrate AI relationships into everyday conversation.\n\nMo Jomaa, partner at CapitalG: While 2025 was the year of \"agent experimentation\" with fragile demos, 2026 will be the year of \"agents in production\" — but only if the infrastructure catches up.\n\nMatt Murphy, partner at Menlo Ventures: The training data market, e.g. Mercor and Handshake, explodes as large and small model developers race to create models that are the best at very specific skill sets. This dramatically accelerates innovation in a broad set of verticals with legal and healthcare as the early movers, but also at risk of overfunding. The new frontier is the next 100 verticals.\n\nAaron Holiday, cofounder and managing partner at 645 Ventures: Generative AI coding tools like Replit, Loveable, and Cursor are lowering the barriers to entry so dramatically that founders who previously lacked engineering resources or traditional credentials can now build and ship products at unprecedented speed.\n\nThe fluidity from idea to software product will lead to a surge in startup formation and product releases at a scale the industry has never seen before.",

    "fullText": "It's not yet 5 pm on a Thursday in late November, and the skies have fully darkened over the City of London's Leadenhall Market. It's the coldest day in recent memory, a harbinger of the looming winter, but no matter.\n\nHere in London, it's time for a pint.\n\nAfter-work pints have been a sacred tradition of British workers for centuries. For years, Leadenhall Market has been the go-to spot for bankers, insurance brokers, and financial advisors who work in the City, the financial center of London.\n\nBut reports of waning nightlife due to a post-pandemic hangover and Gen Z's growing disinterest in drinking have worried pub-goers and publicans alike.\n\nOver a quarter - 26% - of people in the UK, 16 to 24-year-olds reported themselves as not having an alcoholic drink in a year, according to the most recent Health Survey for England conducted by the National Health Service in 2022. That's the highest percentage of any age group.\n\nThis December, research group IWSR said that Brits are drinking less than ever before, with the average person in the UK having just over 10 drinks a week, down almost 30% from previous highs.\n\nGiven these fears, the Mayor of London has even assembled a task force to help \"protect, retain and grow nightlife\" in the nation's capital.\n\nWrapped up in my warmest scarf and gloves, I paid a visit to this mecca of City nightlife to find out firsthand whether these reports of dampened spirits were true.\n\nNon-locals might not expect a sea of finance bros in this historic covered market, fitting of the Harry Potter universe — probably because it is a scene from that universe. In 2001, Leadenhall Market was used as the exterior of the Leaky Cauldron in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\n\nThe pathways are lined with cobblestones, and the red columns and arched ceilings have been decorated with ornaments. In the center of the market, a Christmas tree towered over tourists with selfie sticks.\n\nBut if you work in the City — the financial center of London — you know that the real attraction of Leadenhall Market is Thursday evening pints.\n\nWhen I arrived just before the clock struck happy hour, the market's alleys were already lively. Men and women dressed almost exclusively in black and brown coats were packed into the barriers outside the pubs, despite the bitter cold.\n\n\"You get used to it,\" Callum, a 26-year-old working as a recruiter in financial services, said with a shrug. \"A beer jacket is a great thing to have.\"\n\nAdmittedly, these crowds aren't quite what I was expecting.\n\nThe data indicate that London hasn't quite recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, with the city losing a fifth of its late-night venues since 2020, according to a report published in August from the Nighttime Industries Association.\n\nNot everyone's mourning this loss. Some embrace it.\n\nOutside The Swan, I chat with a group of young men who are out for a birthday celebration.\n\n\"He's 26,\" said Joy, who works in insurance, pointing to his friend. \"Pushing 30.\"\n\nJoy, solidly a member of Gen Z, said he doesn't hang around Leadenhall Market too much.\n\n\"Previous generations, it would just be this, just drinking,\" he says of after-work corporate culture. \"But we do a lot more stuff as well, like sports. We play football or padel.\"\n\nDrinking is expensive, for one, and the inflation rate for alcohol leapt after the pandemic. The cost of living is a factor, as is the desire to be healthy and develop meaningful friendships.\n\n\"It's about trying to find a way to connect to others,\" added Michael, also a 24-year-old insurance worker. \"And it helps you drink less than previous generations.\"\n\nJoy and Michael aren't cutting out alcohol entirely. They're out tonight for a special celebration, and Michael mentions that after volleyball practice, he and his fellow players go out for a pint or two. But it's a more moderate approach than their older colleagues, they agreed.\n\nCaroline, a bartender who has worked at Leadenhall Market for 13 years, says that things didn't take too long to return to normal.\n\n\"The City of London is sort of different from other sites. People spend money in this area,\" Caroline said.\n\nStill, things look a little different. Not as many Gen Z-ers buy rounds, Caroline told me, although she's noticed the younger generations are taking more shots than they once did.\n\nBut the biggest difference is the Thursday-ification of after-work drinking culture.\n\nFriday used to be the big night out, but things have changed largely due to the hybrid working culture now present in much of the corporate world.\n\n\"On Friday, most people aren't working in the City,\" Alex, who works in software, told me outside a traditional pub called New Moon. \"There are less people around on Fridays, but the pubs are always busy on a Thursday night.\"\n\nIt's a trend that Caroline has noticed, along with bartender Paolo, who's worked in Leadenhall Market for the past seven years.\n\n\"It's more of a Tuesday to Thursday culture,\" Paolo said, in comparison to the glory days of five nights a week of City workers out for a drink.\n\nIf Leadenhall Market is any bellwether of London as a whole, it would be premature to say nightlife is marching toward its own death. But, thanks in part to Gen Z and changing work habits overall, it does seem to be transforming.\n\nThe sacred London after-work pint is safe, for now.",

    "description": "Three AI engineers explain how returning to school, internships, and college relationships led to jobs at startups and major tech companies.",
    "fullText": "AI has become one of the most popular fields in tech. The people working in it didn't all follow the same path to get there, but for some, college played a crucial role in their success.\n\nFor one AI startup engineer, returning to school provided an opportunity to explore what an AI career would be like before committing to it. For another, moving to the US for a graduate program opened doors to being closer to the center of the action in Big Tech. In another case, relationships formed during college — with peers, professors, and mentors — continued to shape his career even long after graduation.\n\nBelow are three people who pivoted into AI roles and shared with Business Insider how they leveraged their college experience to break into the field. Quotes have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nVarun Goyal is a 25-year-old AI startup engineer, based in California.\n\nIn my final year of undergraduate studies, I stood at a crossroads between quantitative trading and pursuing a career in technology. Blinded by the initial high salary and prestige, I joined a firm in India as a quantitative strategist for the summer.\n\nI enjoyed it, but I wanted to push boundaries in my career and was increasingly convinced that I should return to school to explore more options. I decided to move from India to the US for my master's degree in computer science.\n\nReturning to school gave me the opportunity to pursue research and engage with senior industry professionals in both fields. This was the biggest benefit for me when I was deciding what I wanted my daily life and career to look like in 10 years.\n\nIn graduate school, the AI boom was also happening. It kept me up at night in the best way possible. I ultimately applied to both industries and had a few quant interviews, but I decided to join an AI startup in 2024 after graduating. I took a lower base salary than what I would have earned in quant, but I felt AI gave me more options down the line.\n\nWithout going back for my master's, I wouldn't have had this opportunity, and I love working in AI.\n\nDeep Shah is a 30-year-old software engineer at Google, based in Mountain View, CA.\n\nGrowing up, I wanted to develop my own computer games, which was the primary reason I chose to pursue a career in computer engineering. I also learned through conversations with peers older than me that the field involved a lot of automating machines to work on my behalf, which excited me. This was my first experience with mentorship.\n\nWhen I was pursuing my bachelor's degree, I got involved with professors who believed in and supported me. Having someone expose me to machine learning or AI problems they're excited about, no matter how small or large, taught me skills that are rarely learned just by doing the core work.\n\nEach mentor will teach you different things, and the person doesn't necessarily need to be a professor. They could be an alum or someone who's more senior at your college. Working with a mentor is also a valuable addition to your résumé, demonstrating that you already possess the skills and experience necessary to succeed in a professional environment.\n\nLater in my career, leaning on peers and mentors provided me with opportunities to further advance my career at Google. I joined Google Bangalore in 2018 after speaking with a friend who worked there. He helped me decide the role I was applying for could be the right fit for me.\n\nIn 2021, I was still at Google Bangalore and wanted to contribute to improving the user experience on Google search. The team working on that project was based in Mountain View, CA, and my skill set was a very good match, so I decided to relocate to the US to join that team.\n\nBuilding my networking skills with peers and mentors throughout my education directly contributed to my later success at Google.\n\nKriti Goyal is a 28-year-old AI machine learning engineer at a Big Tech company, based in Seattle.\n\nI always thought I would study medicine until my cousin showed me a Code.org video with Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and other tech rockstars, about how coding is the quickest way to convert an idea into a product. That changed my life.\n\nI'm now part of the Foundation Model main framework team for a major Big Tech company in the US. This year, I completed five years with them, during which time I've held four different roles. I used my master's to move to the US and further my career.\n\nI originally interned at my current company in India. I enjoyed working in India, but the core business decisions and strategizing for the next projects were made at the company headquarters here in the US.\n\nI had two ways to go about moving to the US. One was to try to move within my company or pursue a master's degree. Two reasons I chose the master's path are the knowledge and extra specialty you can develop through projects, as well as the connections you make. The biggest thing I took away from my program was the people I met.\n\nWhen I arrived in the US, I knew a few people from my former company from my time in India, so I reached out to them directly instead of applying through the job board. I got the interview for a machine learning engineering internship quite easily because the company was already familiar with my work.\n\nLearning and networking can be done in many places; it doesn't have to be university. In a city like San Francisco or New York, you could hustle and get the networking benefits of a university and a structured system.\n\nI think it's now possible to skip that education stage. But I have seen a bias in hiring for specific teams, and it's not unbreakable yet. I was changing countries and cultures, and university was a great way to get through the immigration system and understand the culture. I needed it, and I feel fortunate to be where I am in my career because I made the decision to pursue my master's degree.\n\nDo you have a story to share about breaking into the AI field?

    "fullText": "A vacation destination nestled off the coast of Australia will soon be owned by Blackstone, the US-based investment firm.\n\nBlackstone announced on December 23 that it entered an agreement to acquire Hamilton Island. Outlets, including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, said the deal is worth $1.2 billion.\n\n\"This investment, which is subject to customary regulatory approvals, builds on Blackstone's leading global position in leisure and hospitality, including in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, where it has made significant investments across Australia, Japan, and India,\" Blackstone said in a press release.\n\nBlackstone valued its real estate portfolio, which includes numerous vacation destinations worldwide, at $611 billion as of September 2025.\n\nHere is what Blackstone is getting with its latest purchase.\n\nHamilton Island is part of the Whitsunday Islands chain in Queensland, located off the northeast coast of Australia. The Ngaro people originally lived on the Whitsunday Islands, which are near the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nTourists from Australia's outback and southern region began vacationing at Hamilton Island in the 1920s, according to the Hamilton Island tourism website.\n\nHamilton Island transformed into a resort destination in the 1980s under Keith Williams, who owned and operated the island for two decades, according to the tourism website.\n\nDuring that time, he built Hamilton Island's marina and a resort. The island was later acquired by the family of Bob Oatley, a famous Australian winemaker.\n\nThe Hamilton Island tourism website said the Oatley family spends millions of dollars each year on upgrading the infrastructure, accommodations, and services.\n\nHamilton Island measures 2,800 acres across two islands. There are five hotels, 20 retailers, over 20 restaurants and bars, a marina, a golf course, and a commercial airport.\n\nAbout 70% of the area remains undeveloped, Blackstone said.\n\nHamilton Island is located near the Great Barrier Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. As a result, significant efforts are made to preserve the area.\n\nIn addition to sustainable waste disposal, the tourism site said the island has nature-based experiences to educate guests, island-wide erosion and sediment control measures, water treatment plans, liquid composters, and more.\n\nHamilton Island has a range of activities for guests, including ATV riding for children, snorkeling, mountain biking, a golf club, a yacht club, and more.\n\nHamilton Island's position near the Coral Sea makes it an ideal destination for sailing, a popular activity among visitors. In addition to the marina and local yacht club, Hamilton Island has hosted an annual sailing race week for four decades.\n\nThe next race week is scheduled for August 2026.\n\nNearly two decades ago, Queensland's tourism office launched a campaign encouraging people to apply for the \"Best Job in the World\": a six-month stint as a caretaker on Hamilton Island.\n\nQueensland's tourism website said the winner, Ben Southall, beat out over 34,000 applicants from over 200 countries. The BBC reported that the position came with a $150,000 salary and a luxury villa for accommodation.",

    "description": "Even though April is a long way off, it's a good idea to start planning now on how to reduce your tax bill.",
    "fullText": "You don't normally associate the time of Christmas cookies and New Year's bubbly with tax season. But even though April is a long way off, it's a good idea to start planning now on how to reduce your tax bill.\n\nIf you own stocks or other assets, one simple way to cut down your taxable income is a strategy known as tax-loss harvesting. Essentially, you sell any assets that have lost value since you bought them, locking in the capital loss. The deadline to be able to claim these losses for next year's taxes is December 31, giving you today, tomorrow, and Wednesday to sell.\n\nThere are two main ways you can use the strategy to reduce your taxes. One, you can use the losses to offset any capital gains you locked in this year. And two, you can use capital losses to offset regular W-2 income by up to $3,000.\n\nIf you use the strategy, keep in mind the wash-sale rule. This stipulates that you can't buy the same asset, or something \"substantially identical,\" in the 30-day period before and after selling for a loss. But in that window, you're allowed to move your money into an asset that is different enough from the asset you're selling.\n\nWhat constitutes an asset that is different enough is up to the interpretation of the IRS, but an obvious example that probably wouldn't fly is starting a position in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) right before or after selling shares of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) at a loss.\n\nOne candidate for tax-loss harvesting this year is crypto. The digital assets suffered big losses in 2025. While bitcoin and ethereum are down 6% and 12% year-to-date, respectively, if you bought at their October 7 highs, you'd be down 29% and 37%.\n\nOther assets that have had a rough go of it recently include shares of Coreweave (CRWV) and Oracle (ORCL), which have fallen 45% and 39% from recent highs, respectively. But it all depends on when you bought in.\n\nThe strategy isn't necessarily for everyone. If you plan on holding your assets for a long time, it may be best not to sell, as you could miss potential upside in the near term.\n\nUltimately, it is recommended that you consult a financial advisor. But if your investing journey didn't go quite according to plan in 2025, tax-loss harvesting could be one way to turn a negative into a positive as we head into the new year.",

    "description": "TikTok jumped into the top spot among social apps where young people regularly get news, according to data from the Pew Research Center.",
    "fullText": "TikTok has unseated its social media rivals as the top spot for young people to get their news.\n\nTikTok is now the most popular social app for news among 18- to 29-year-olds in the US, according to new survey data from the Pew Research Center. The app surpassed YouTube and Instagram, which were the top choices in 2024.\n\nForty-three percent of young adults said they regularly get news from TikTok in 2025, compared to 41% for both YouTube and Facebook. Forty percent named Instagram as a regular news source, while 21% said X (formerly Twitter) and 18% said Reddit.\n\nSocial media beat out every other format as a place where 18- to 29-year-olds said they get news, according to Pew's survey. Seventy-six percent of the cohort said they often or sometimes get news from social media, compared to 60% for news websites and 28% for email newsletters.\n\nHalf of the young adults who responded to Pew's survey said they have some or a lot of trust in social media as a news source. That roughly matched the level of trust the age group has for information from national news organizations.\n\nTikTok has been rising quickly as a go-to source for news. In 2023, 32% of respondents named the video app as a place for regular news consumption.\n\nWatching news on TikTok does not necessarily mean tuning into videos from traditional outlets like The Washington Post or NBC News. Young people view commentary from news influencers and user-generated videos tied to current events, such as from a war zone or protest, as news as well.\n\nA new crop of independent news influencers has emerged to report on current events, including creators like Philip DeFranco and Vitus \"V\" Spehar's @underthedesknews.\n\nSome professional news organizations, including NPR's \"Planet Money,\" have similarly centered videos on individual creators who can help build trust with their audiences. Gen Z social-media users told Business Insider that they are drawn to news creators who can deliver information in a more authentic and relatable manner.\n\nBeyond news commentary, social media creators and podcasters have taken on a bigger role in news gathering in recent months. Politicians and government institutions are turning to podcasts and other formats to reach people, and content creators had a big presence at national conventions for the Democrats and Republicans last year. Many independent creators have applied for access to White House press briefings in 2025.\n\nTikTok has introduced a handful of features tied to news on its app, including the ability for publishers to link to articles inside videos and a \"community notes\" style fact-checking tool called footnotes. It also works with \"independent fact-checkers in over 130 markets to determine if content is accurate,\" according to its website.",

He began his career as a researcher at IBM before joining Meta, where he advanced from researcher to manager in just three years, according to his LinkedIn profile. He then held director positions at Square and Snacphat, and was vice president of engineering at HubSpot, before he joined HeyGen, a visual storytelling platform, in 2024.\n\nOver the years, he said he has noticed that those he has mentored can make themselves miserable when they strive for a promotion.\n\n\"Don't do that,\" he said. \"When you start to get into that mindset, you start to count your happiness or your career growth toward something that you don't have full control over.\"\n\nIt's better to control the things you can control. \"Learn how to adjust, and you'll be a better self afterward,\" he said.\n\nFor those still determined to seek a promotion, however, timing matters.\n\nExecutive coach Andrea Wasserman previously told Business Insider that it's best to put yourself in your manager's shoes and think about what's happening across the team or company. Ask yourself, \"Will this timing make it easier or harder for me to get a 'yes?'\"",

    "description": "AI in the workplace may boost speed and efficiency, but risks eroding confidence and critical thinking, the CEO of a digital economy think tank said.",
    "fullText": "AI appears to be making workers faster, more efficient, and more productive on paper.\n\nHowever, according to Mehdi Paryavi, CEO of the International Data Center Authority, which advises companies and governments on building the data centers that power AI, it may also be quietly eroding workers' confidence in their job skills.\n\nParyavi told Buisness Insider that excessive and poorly designed AI use in workplaces is driving what he called a \"quiet cognitive erosion\" and \"down-skilling.\"\n\n\"There used to be a notion called 'thinking outside the box,'\" he said. \"That notion will soon cease to exist when everyone draws on all their creativity, analytics, and innovation from a single box called AI.\"\n\nParyavi believes the most immediate casualty of heavy AI reliance is self-belief.\n\n\"If you come to believe that AI writes better than you and thinks smarter than you, you will lose your own confidence in yourself,\" he said.\n\nParyavi said the loss of confidence compounds quickly as workers begin deferring writing, analysis, and judgment to AI systems, gradually relying less on the skills they have built through years of reading, writing, learning, and observation.\n\n\"All of a sudden, you realize you are not good enough without this new tool, and day by day, you rely less on yourself and more on AI,\" he said.\n\nResearch is beginning to reflect that pattern. A new report from the Work AI Institute, produced with researchers from universities including Notre Dame, Harvard, and UC Santa Barbara, found that AI is turning ordinary office workers into people who feel smarter and more productive while their underlying skills slowly erode.\n\nRebecca Hinds, head of the Work AI Institute, told Business Insider that AI creates an illusion of expertise, which is especially risky for early-career employees who still need to establish their foundations.\n\nMuch of the problem, Paryavi said, lies in how leaders define productivity.\n\nAI's biggest promise is speed — faster reports, faster launches, faster analysis. But faster doesn't always mean better, Paryavi said.\n\nWhile AI can generate professional-sounding output, Paryavi said it often lacks the depth that comes from years of hands-on expertise.\n\nThat loss of depth is already visible, according to Anastasia Berg, a philosophy professor at the University of California, Irvine, who has said that workers who rely heavily on AI risk rapid skill atrophy, especially junior employees who never fully learn how to think through problems independently.\n\nParyavi isn't opposed to AI. He said the risk comes from indiscriminate use.\n\nCompanies should tailor AI access by job function, he said, rather than rolling it out universally. Some roles may benefit heavily from AI support, while others should rely primarily on human judgment.\n\nHe also discussed the importance of human involvement at both ends of the workflow — leading creative thinking at the beginning and quality-checking AI output at the end.\n\n\"What's critical to note is that you, the human you, must quality check AI, not the other way around,\" he said.\n\nAI may not eliminate jobs outright. But without deliberate limits, Paryavi said, it could quietly erode the confidence and thinking skills that careers are built on.\n\n\"How much technology do we really need, and how far are we willing to push the envelope? How much is enough?\" he said.",

    "description": "Allocators and portfolio managers have fully embraced the SMA. The trend will only accelerate in 2026, insiders say.",
    "fullText": "Most viral trends have a short half-life. Labubus are destined to gather dust in closets, the \"6—7\" meme will become cringe the moment a critical mass of adults figures it out, and other fads from 2025 will similarly recede in favor of fresh cultural hype.\n\nOne of the biggest trends in the hedge-fund world, however, appears to be doing the opposite. Its popularity is surging heading into 2026, according to industry insiders.\n\nThe so-called separately managed account, or SMA, sounds stodgy and is by no means new. But this way of investing in top hedge-fund strategies and talent reached new heights in 2025 — and now, everyone wants a piece of the action.\n\nInvestors across the spectrum are competing to plow money into promising hedge funds through SMAs, while a growing number of portfolio managers are emerging to grab the cash.\n\nA quick refresher: Traditionally, hedge funds raise capital by securing a group of investors, or limited partners, into a single commingled pool of money. That capital is then deployed across long-short equity, merger arbitrage, distressed credit, or myriad other strategies. Allocators receive periodic performance updates but have limited visibility into day-to-day positions, and their money is typically locked up to avoid panicked withdrawals during market stress.\n\nWith a managed account — which has existed for decades but gained traction in the 2010s after the financial crisis and Bernie Madoff debacle — investors get white-glove treatment. Their money may be deployed in similar strategies, but it's handled separately, with daily transparency into trades and positions and often the ability to redeem on short notice.\n\nIt's a bit like flying via private jet versus commercial: The destination is ultimately the same, but with a different level of service, control, and prestige.\n\nHistorically, most hedge-fund managers avoided SMAs. They added operational complexity and carried a stigma — a perception that a manager offering one couldn't raise a traditional fund.\n\nThat has all changed dramatically in recent years.\n\n\"There's no negative connotation around offering an SMA now. It's almost mandatory,\" Jon Caplis, CEO of hedge fund research firm PivotalPath, told Business Insider.\n\nOverall, SMA capital grew 27% in 2024 to $315 billion, according to Goldman Sachs research, and it has continued to climb since.\n\nInnocap, one of the largest providers of managed-account services to institutional allocators, sold minority equity stakes this year to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Bain Capital. Assets on its platform climbed from about $85 billion in April to more than $100 billion six months later.\n\nOne major growth driver in recent years has been the end of the era of zero-interest rates. Another seductive feature of the SMA structure, especially when interest rates are rising and cash earns higher returns, is that it allows investors to size up exposure to hedge fund strategies directly using borrowed money, preserving cash for other uses — or \"capital efficiency\" in industry speak.\n\nThe trend has been supercharged by the embrace of large multistrategy, multimanager hedge funds. These firms have amassed hundreds of billions of dollars — and are locked in a fierce battle for the top investment talent to deploy it.\n\nAs another way to gain exposure to elite traders, multimanagers have increasingly allocated capital to external portfolio managers through SMAs. By mid-2025, nearly 75% of multimanagers had backed an external PM, up from 54% in 2022, according to Goldman Sachs. Two-thirds of those allocations have come since 2024, and 90% since 2022 — almost exclusively via SMAs.\n\nActivity midway through 2025 was on pace to eclipse 2024 levels, Goldman said.\n\nWhile emerging managers and smaller funds account for much of the uptick in SMAs, established managers are also increasingly opening up to the SMA, according to a banker who advises hedge funds, who told Business Insider.\n\n\"Most new launch portfolio managers, their dream is to have a multi-billion-dollar commingled fund one day,\" said Jorge Hendrickson, cohead of prime services at Jones Trading, which provides hedge-fund services. \"But then, as they have investor conversations, depending on strategy, they start to realize a lot of the capital most readily available is actually from the SMA allocators.\"\n\nTom Bradbeer, who leads the hedge fund practice at search firm Maven Partnership, said the PMs they work with are increasingly asking about — and pursuing — SMAs. The emergence of more service providers and off-the-shelf products — access to data, trading infrastructure, risk systems, compliance, or back office — has made the transition easier than ever, he added.\n\n\"The barrier to entry is a lot lower,\" Bradbeer said.\n\nMomentum is only building as we head into 2026. Multimanagers have signaled plans to increase their external allocations next year, the banker said, while traditional allocators leaning into SMAs are adding more fuel to the fire.\n\nSeveral large banks are also prepping funds to allocate to external PMs, according to With Intelligence's 2026 Hedge Fund Outlook report.\n\n\"It's just accelerated. And we're far from it slowing down,\" one hedge fund allocator, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly, told Business Insider. \"Peers that haven't historically are now dabbling in it.\"\n\nAs SMA capital floods the market, the balance of power is shifting.\n\nWith more allocators competing for deals, emerging managers are becoming choosier — and increasingly reluctant to accept exclusive SMA arrangements, industry insiders said.\n\nAllocators, in turn, are pitching PMs on more than just capital.\n\n\"It's not just 'hey we'll give you capital' but 'here's ours and why you should take it versus others,'\" said one hedge fund exec, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly.\n\nPMs considering SMA-backed launches are also becoming savvier, insiders said, pressing harder on terms related to liquidity, exclusivity, and transparency.\n\nThose concerns were highlighted in a March paper from quant hedge fund Squarepoint, which has invested internal capital in external strategies via SMAs since 2018. The firm cautioned that some allocators may misuse SMA transparency by making parallel trades or replicating strategies internally — a practice it refers to as \"shadow alpha.\"\n\nSuch behavior can siphon profits from the SMA manager or erode the strategy's alpha, Squarepoint wrote, harming not only the PM but their other investors as well.\n\nSquarepoint — which typically makes nonexclusive investments — urged PMs to establish guardrails in their agreements and to ask probing questions before signing on with an allocator.\n\n\"The main point is just making sure that we're all on a level playing field,\" Nicolas Janson, head of external strategies at the fund, told Business Insider. \"Essentially, it's know your allocator.\"\n\nJanson said Squarepoint received positive responses to the paper, including direct action from some emerging managers.\n\n\"What we're hoping is that the industry as a whole starts to speak more about it and that the SMA business gradually evolves until shadow alphas are no longer,\" Janson said.\n\nAnother challenge emerging managers will face in 2026 is the talent war. Many of the same multimanagers seeding PMs through SMAs are also expanding aggressively — making it harder for startup funds to recruit analysts, researchers, and technologists.\n\n\"With the scrap for talent among multimanagers, it makes it incredibly hard for the smaller emerging funds to compete,\" Bradbeer said, adding that candidates considering joining such operations face significant career disruption if it doesn't pan out.",

Trump noted that the monthslong U.S.-led negotiations could still collapse.\n\n“Without security guarantees, realistically, this war will not end,” Zelenskyy told reporters in voice messages responding to questions sent via a Whatsapp chat.\n\nUkraine has been fighting Russia since 2014, when it illegally annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists took up arms in the Donbas, a vital industrial region in eastern Ukraine.\n\nDetails of the security guarantees have not become public but Zelenskyy said Monday that they include how a peace deal would be monitored as well as the “presence” of partners. He didn’t elaborate, but Russia has said it won’t accept the deployment in Ukraine of troops from NATO countries.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump were expected to speak in the near future but there was no indication the Russian leader would speak to Zelenskyy.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Kyiv’s allies will meet in Paris in early January to “finalize each country’s concrete contributions” to the security guarantees.\n\nTrump said he would consider extending U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine beyond 15 years, according to Zelenskyy. The guarantees would be approved by the U.S. Congress as well as by parliaments in other countries involved in overseeing any settlement, he said.\n\nZelenskyy said he wants the 20-point peace plan under discussion to be approved by Ukrainians in a national referendum.\n\nHowever, holding a ballot requires a ceasefire of at least 60 days, and Moscow has shown no willingness for a truce without a full settlement.\n\nFollow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

    "fullText": "KISKUNMAJSA, Hungary (AP) — Oszkár Nagyapáti climbed to the bottom of a sandy pit on his land on the Great Hungarian Plain and dug into the soil with his hand, looking for a sign of groundwater that in recent years has been in accelerating retreat.\n\n“It’s much worse, and it’s getting worse year after year,” he said as cloudy liquid slowly seeped into the hole. ”Where did so much water go? It’s unbelievable.”\n\nNagyapáti has watched with distress as the region in southern Hungary, once an important site for agriculture, has become increasingly parched and dry. Where a variety of crops and grasses once filled the fields, today there are wide cracks in the soil and growing sand dunes more reminiscent of the Sahara Desert than Central Europe.\n\nThe region, known as the Homokhátság, has been described by some studies as semiarid — a distinction more common in parts of Africa, the American Southwest or Australian Outback — and is characterized by very little rain, dried-out wells and a water table plunging ever deeper underground.\n\nIn a 2017 paper in European Countryside, a scientific journal, researchers cited “the combined effect of climatic changes, improper land use and inappropriate environmental management” as causes for the Homokhátság's aridification, a phenomenon the paper called unique in this part of the continent.\n\nFields that in previous centuries would be regularly flooded by the Danube and Tisza Rivers have, through a combination of climate change-related droughts and poor water retention practices, become nearly unsuitable for crops and wildlife.\n\nNow a group of farmers and other volunteers, led by Nagyapáti, are trying to save the region and their lands from total desiccation using a resource for which Hungary is famous: thermal water.\n\n“I was thinking about what could be done, how could we bring the water back or somehow create water in the landscape,\" Nagyapáti told The Associated Press. \"There was a point when I felt that enough is enough. We really have to put an end to this. And that's where we started our project to flood some areas to keep the water in the plain.”\n\nAlong with the group of volunteer “water guardians,” Nagyapáti began negotiating with authorities and a local thermal spa last year, hoping to redirect the spa's overflow water — which would usually pour unused into a canal — onto their lands. The thermal water is drawn from very deep underground.\n\nAccording to the water guardians' plan, the water, cooled and purified, would be used to flood a 2½-hectare (6-acre) low-lying field — a way of mimicking the natural cycle of flooding that channelizing the rivers had ended.\n\n“When the flooding is complete and the water recedes, there will be 2½ hectares of water surface in this area,\" Nagyapáti said. \"This will be quite a shocking sight in our dry region.”\n\nA 2024 study by Hungary’s Eötvös Loránd University showed that unusually dry layers of surface-level air in the region had prevented any arriving storm fronts from producing precipitation. Instead, the fronts would pass through without rain, and result in high winds that dried out the topsoil even further.\n\nThe water guardians hoped that by artificially flooding certain areas, they wouldn't only raise the groundwater level but also create a microclimate through surface evaporation that could increase humidity, reduce temperatures and dust and have a positive impact on nearby vegetation.\n\nTamás Tóth, a meteorologist in Hungary, said that because of the potential impact such wetlands can have on the surrounding climate, water retention “is simply the key issue in the coming years and for generations to come, because climate change does not seem to stop.”\n\n\"The atmosphere continues to warm up, and with it the distribution of precipitation, both seasonal and annual, has become very hectic, and is expected to become even more hectic in the future,” he said.\n\nFollowing another hot, dry summer this year, the water guardians blocked a series of sluices along a canal, and the repurposed water from the spa began slowly gathering in the low-lying field.\n\nAfter a couple of months, the field had nearly been filled. Standing beside the area in early December, Nagyapáti said that the shallow marsh that had formed \"may seem very small to look at it, but it brings us immense happiness here in the desert.”\n\nHe said the added water will have a “huge impact” within a roughly 4-kilometer (2½-mile) radius, \"not only on the vegetation, but also on the water balance of the soil. We hope that the groundwater level will also rise.”\n\nPersistent droughts in the Great Hungarian Plain have threatened desertification, a process where vegetation recedes because of high heat and low rainfall. Weather-damaged crops have dealt significant blows to the country’s overall gross domestic product, prompting Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to announce this year the creation of a “drought task force” to deal with the problem.\n\nAfter the water guardians' first attempt to mitigate the growing problem in their area, they said they experienced noticeable improvements in the groundwater level, as well as an increase of flora and fauna near the flood site.\n\nThe group, which has grown to more than 30 volunteers, would like to expand the project to include another flooded field, and hopes their efforts could inspire similar action by others to conserve the most precious resource.\n\n“This initiative can serve as an example for everyone, we need more and more efforts like this,\" Nagyapáti said. \"We retained water from the spa, but retaining any kind of water, whether in a village or a town, is a tremendous opportunity for water replenishment.”\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "fullText": "Every new year brings great expectations and hopes for boxing fans.\n\nWill we see the biggest fights? Are we finally going to get Anthony Joshua v Tyson Fury? Who will emerge as the next big star?\n\nHere BBC Sport picks out some bouts we want to see in 2026.\n\nRight it's the big one and the serial heartbreaker – Joshua v Fury.\n\nWe've come close before, several times, but this time we are filled with renewed optimism the heavyweight super-fight will happen.\n\nForget the fact neither man is world champion or that Fury, 37, has been retired for a year, or the fight is a few years late with Joshua now 36, we'd still really like to see it.\n\nIt would be a seminal moment for the two best British heavyweights of their era to face each other.\n\nAnd if it does happen, we expect it to be in the UK at the end of 2026.\n\nLightweight world champion Caroline Dubois is quickly emerging as the next major talent. Now aligned with Jake Paul's Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), she made her promotional debut in December with an impressive win against Camilla Panatta.\n\nSurely unification fights are next for the 24-year-old and who is a better option than fellow Briton and WBO belt holder Terri Harper?\n\nThe pair don't seem to be the biggest fans of each other but now they're under the same promotional banner.\n\nBoth fight at pace and it has all the makings of a British boxing classic - never mind the fact they're both world champions.\n\nUnified super-featherweight Alycia Baumgardner is also an intriguing and fun option for either woman, although the 31-year-old American beat Harper in a title bout back in 2021.\n\nLight-welterweight Adam Azim will be in action live on BBC Two against Argentine Gustavo Daniel Lemos on 31 January, but it really is just about time for the unbeaten 23-year-old Briton to make a big step up.\n\nSheffield's Dalton Smith is a brilliant fight for Azim. The 28-year-old challenges for a world title on 10 January against Subriel Matias.\n\nShould Smith win, Slough-born Azim could face him in a world championship contest, but defeat would make it a massive must-win all-British encounter.\n\nThis is the fight for the boxing purists. Former bantamweight world champion Junto Nakatani's move to super-bantamweight in December was basically to pave the way for an all-Japanese world title super-fight with Naoya Inoue.\n\nMultiple world champion Inoue, 32, is widely considered the standout fighter in any weight division. No-one has got close to 'The Monster', but perhaps the 27-year-old Nakatani will be the man to do it.\n\nBoth are unbeaten, with 51 knockouts between them, and it could be a fight for the ages.\n\nWe were expecting this fight to happen in 2025, but boxing politics appeared to get in the way.\n\nLauren Price, 31, has been impeccable since turning professional and is already a unified champion at welterweight after just nine fights.\n\nThe only belt she doesn't have, Mikaela Mayer does. Unable to defend that WBO title against Price, Mayer casually jumped up to light-middleweight to become a three-weight world champion.\n\nMayer's success adds to the intrigue of a showdown with Price and the outspoken American, 35, may produce some verbal fireworks from the usually calm Welsh boxer.\n\nFabio Wardley is living the dream as a white-collar boxer turned heavyweight world champion.\n\nThe 31-year-old will be expected to have a low-risk first defence of his WBO title, but we'd really love to see the big-hitting Ipswich man in the ring with the division's brightest prospect in 20-year-old Moses Itauma.\n\nThey are likely to be two of the biggest figures in British boxing over the next five years and seem certain to meet at some stage.\n\nWhy not now, when Wardley has a world title to his name?\n\nConor Benn v Ryan Garcia or Lewis Crocker\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2025\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

Atkinson played no further part as England completed a four-wicket win later the same day.\n\nThere is no confirmation on when he will return to the UK, at which point he will be assessed further. Earlier this year Atkinson spent two months out with an injury to his right hamstring.\n\nAtkinson's absence leaves Durham's Potts in line to add his to his 10 Test caps and make an Ashes debut.\n\nThe 27-year-old has not played a Test match since the defeat by New Zealand in Hamilton last December.\n\nA regular in the first summer of the Ben Stokes-Brendon McCullum era, Potts has made sporadic appearances over the past two years.

    "fullText": "As the Women’s Super League enjoys its last bit of rest before the January transfer window and the second half of the season, The Athletic takes a look back at what stood out in European women’s football in 2025.\n\nIt was a year of the unlikely, with Arsenal overcoming the odds to upset three-time Champions League winners Barcelona. Even if the magic didn’t last, the feat was something to behold in May.\n\nAnd although the Lionesses were the European Championship holders, a misstep against France in their opening game added some drama to an eventual final win, another England vs Spain showdown.\n\nCharlotte Harpur and Michael Cox reflect on the moments that stuck with them after another monumental year for women’s football in Europe.\n\nThe achievement is remarkable in itself but the way it was done will go down in history. Unlike Euro 2022, it was not a smooth ride for the Lionesses. Player retirements and withdrawals weeks before the tournament threatened to rock the boat, before an opening 2-1 defeat to France put their backs against the wall. Somehow, England found a way in every knockout game, even when they looked down and out.\n\nBlackburn Rovers’ financial troubles\n\nIt was a stark reminder of the fragility of women’s football. Blackburn Rovers’ owner, V H Group, decided not to fulfil the required licensing criteria to stay in Women’s Super League 2, English football’s second division.\n\nBlackburn, who helped produce England stars Georgia Stanway, Ella Toone and Keira Walsh, were demoted and now compete in the regional fourth tier.\n\nThe Athletic reported in June that the proposed redundancies could impact at least 20 members of staff and all senior players were due to be released upon the expiry of their contracts that summer.\n\nWomen’s Euros quarter-final: France vs Germany\n\nThe excitement before Germany versus France was helped by the fitting location of Basel, which is within walking distance of both countries’ borders. But the game seemed to be dead within 12 minutes, when Germany centre-back Kathrin Hendrich was sent off for foolishly pulling Griedge Mbock Bathy’s hair inside the box. Grace Geyoro converted from the spot and then it was 1-0, 11 versus 10 — surely no way back for Germany.\n\nYet somehow, they stayed in it. Sjoeke Nusken headed home an unlikely equaliser from a corner and France had two goals disallowed for offside. Germany, who had barely crossed the halfway line for much of the game, won a penalty out of nothing. Nusken stepped up but saw her spot kick saved by Pauline Peyraud-Magnin. Germany had surely blown their chance.\n\nThen came the most memorable moment, when Sakina Karchaoui’s cross into the box was inadvertently flicked on by Nusken towards her own goal, looping over the seemingly helpless Ann-Katrin Berger. It seemed a certain goal, only for Germany’s goalkeeper to backpedal, dive vertically backwards and claw the ball away. It was a truly remarkable save. Germany had somehow made it to extra time.\n\nThey were on the back foot throughout the half-hour period, which ended when France’s Melvine Malard thumped the bar from 30 yards in the final minute. By that point, you knew it was Germany’s day. Berger didn’t just save two penalties, but she also scored one herself. For sheer drama, it was as good as football gets.\n\nSpain and Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmati won the Ballon d’Or and the award for Euro 2025’s best player, but in truth, she wasn’t at her best in a year when she was affected by injury and illness. Her team-mate, Alexia Putellas, was magnificent in the group stage in Switzerland but faded in the knockout matches.\n\nInstead, this was the year when their midfield colleague for club and country, Patri Guijarro, stamped her mark on matches at the highest level. A consistent but underrated performer for Barcelona, she was absent from Spain’s World Cup success in 2023 but was their standout performer at Euro 2025, setting the tone for Spain’s possession play with incisive passes from deep, making sudden forward runs to catch out opponents who don’t expect a holding midfielder to be popping up in attack, and charging forward to press on the edge of the opposition box. Her performances for Barcelona have also been exceptional.\n\n“Playing with her is very easy and very difficult at the same time,” said her team-mate Vicky Lopez. “There are passes that only she sees and you don’t expect. You have to get used to her.”\n\nFor all the discussion that some of the outsiders are catching up with the traditional powers, there remains an obvious ‘big six’ in European international football: England, France, Spain, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands. And the simple reality is that they don’t lose to the other nations. Those big six won all 10 games against the other teams at Euro 2025. Include Euro 2022, and you can extend that to winning 26 of 27 matches played — and the exception was Iceland snatching a last-minute draw against a France side who were already assured of top spot in their group.\n\nEverything revolves around this, and all the narratives we create are largely about the draw. Italy reached the semi-finals largely because they avoided a big-six team in the quarter-finals. The Netherlands crashed out early because they were in a group with England and France.\n\nChelsea manager Sonia Bompastor did not mince her words. She came out punching, defending her goalkeeper Hannah Hampton and England manager Sarina Wiegman following former England No 1 Mary Earps’ comments in her book about the events that led to her international retirement before the 2025 Euros.\n\n“With what I read in terms of the comments coming from Mary Earps, it’s not acceptable to not show respect to your team-mates or managers,” she said after Chelsea beat London City Lionesses 2-0 in November.\n\n“We are talking about Hannah, but I want to raise my voice for Sarina. When you use some words about someone who won the Euros three times in a row, you should probably think about it before you speak.\n\n“If you look at what Hannah said in her previous comments about Mary Earps, then what Mary is saying about her now — one of them is class, and Hannah is the class one.”\n\nArsenal were the clear underdogs heading into the Champions League final. It was almost David against Goliath and very few thought they could dethrone three-time winners Barcelona from their lofty perch in Lisbon.\n\nAlmost everything about the win seemed unlikely. Head coach Renee Slegers had been an assistant at the start of the season, and was only appointed permanently after a three-month interim spell. Chloe Kelly, who played on the right wing, had been a surprise loan signing on January deadline day. Stina Blackstenius was being mocked for missing easy chances, yet scored the winning goal.\n\nSomehow, everything came together in Lisbon: Slegers’ game plan, Arsenal’s discipline out wide, and Blackstenius’ winner. Unfortunately for the club, the smooth sailing didn’t last the year.\n\nIf you haven’t been watching Dumornay, where have you been? Now in her third season at OL Lyonnes, the 22-year-old punished Manchester United and Arsenal in the Champions League with ruthless efficiency, scoring a brace in each. On more than one occasion, she created space for herself with fluid footwork and unleashed a rocket. In France’s Division 1, she is the league’s top contributor for goal and shot-creating actions.\n\nThe attacking midfielder was one to watch at the 2023 World Cup with Haiti and she is set to tear it up on the European stage.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nEngland, Women's Soccer, Women's Euros\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders lost to the Dallas Cowboys on Christmas day, dropping to 4-12 for the season. It’s been a long wait until Sunday to find out if the Philadelphia Eagles will have anything to play for in Week 18 when they host the Commanders for the season finale. The Eagles squeaked out a win in Buffalo when the Bills went for two, instead of attempting the extra point to take the game into overtime. Philly still has a shot to move up to the #2 seed in the NFC.\n\nThe Washington Commanders are currently sitting in the No. 7 overall spot in next year’s draft, and they can’t drop any lower than that. They can move up with help from other teams. QB Marcus Mariota had stitches in his throwing hand last week and didn’t play on Christmas day, and he was listed as day-to-day. Washington also has other players who are dealing with injuries that could be shut down for the season finale. Will the Eagles play their starters, or do they even need to for this sad finale to a lost season?\n\nJoin our partner FanDuel for all your betting needs\n\nOpening odds for the Commanders have them as 7.5-point home underdogs against the Eagles.

The money was great, but being able to be the inaugural champions you couldn’t ask for anything more. Bringing home that trophy was the best thing.”\n\nThe entire event took roughly a week, with the team first having to beat out other teams in their group stage. Once they qualified for the main field, they put their skills into overdrive and advanced all the way to the championship match, which pitted them against a team from St. Louis. Thus, making it a true, Show-Me State showdown.\n\n“Ultimately, going into it as amateurs, you never expect to win a national championship,” said Gene Wineland. “So it was exciting all the way.”\n\n“To have an all-Missouri final I think it puts Missouri on the map and it shows we have true pool players and competitors in the sport,” Whaley said. “And I think the world knows that now.”\n\nFor Kyle Burne, the thrill of winning the first-of-its-kind tournament was sureal, but so was being able to watch and learn from the sport’s top players.\n\n“There were tons of pros there,” said Kyle Burne. “That was really exciting for me. Getting to see my idol, Shane Van Boening. A lot of the pros that were there, they were taking a lot of the amateur players, like myself, under their wing.”\n\nWhile each member of 8 Runners Southbound played their part to contribute to the win, Robert Conrad walked away with extra bragging rights, over his teammates, since he also won a singles national championship at the event.\n\n“I didn’t go into this thinking it was ever going to happen,” said Robert Conrad. “I was gonna be happy just to participate. But being a two-time national champion, the funnest thing for me is being able to put my name into Google, do an AI search and find out about myself.”",

No details regarding Tshabola's apparent injury have been disclosed, though Tshabola was seen at the Buckeyes' open practice on Dec. 26 in uniform with a brace on his right knee and wrap on his right ankle.\n\nTshabola was listed as doubtful on the injury report released on Dec. 28, which Day indicated would be the case a week earlier.\n\nAlong with Day indicating that Tshabola would miss playing time, the Buckeyes coach added that the team is taking Tshabola's situation \"as it goes.\"\n\nAccording to Day, VanSickle and junior Joshua Padilla will be rotating at the right guard position while Tshabola is out.

    "fullText": "With the San Francisco 49ers beating the Chicago Bears on Sunday Night Football, the Los Angeles Rams have officially been eliminated from contention for winning the NFC West division. The Rams will either be the 5-seed or the 6-seed, and historically those kind of differences have meant little or nothing to head coach Sean McVay. Without anything else on the line, should McVay start resting starters like Matthew Stafford and Puka Nacua as early as Monday night against the Atlanta Falcons?\n\nThat’s a question that will linger on the Rams until Monday night, but the consequences of playing starters and one of them being injured is something that could haunt McVay if he doesn’t play the safe route. McVay almost always chooses the safe route with starters.\n\nIf 49ers and Seahawks both win this weekend, Rams can’t win division. Curious what McVay would do Week 18 vs Arizona. He historically has usually rested his starters without regard for basic seeding differences but a win means at NFC South winner instead of likely at Philly.\n\n— Stuckey (@Stuckey2) December 26, 2025\n\nIf the Rams beat the Falcons on Monday and then the Arizona Cardinals next Sunday, it guarantees that L.A. will be the 5-seed and face the winner of the NFC South. That will be determined by who wins the Bucs-Panthers game next Saturday, unless the Falcons win their remaining two games, then Carolina is the division winner.\n\nOf course, if the Rams lose to the Falcons, it opens them up for the six-seed.\n\nIf the Rams lose to the Falcons and beat the Cardinals, plus the 49ers beat the Seahawks, then L.A. slips to the six-seed. That puts the Rams on the road and instead of facing the winner of the NFC South, they will face either the Eagles or the Bears; most likely the Eagles.\n\nIs it worth it to Sean McVay to risk the health of his starters to try and guarantee a wild card game in Tampa Bay or Carolina rather than having to go to Philadelphia or Chicago?\n\nThe Seahawks and 49ers face off for the NFC West title and number one seed on Saturday night.",

He wants you to give it everything you got each and every play, and it’s always going to come down to effort and finish with your teammates.”\n\nVrabel has done an outstanding job transforming the Patriots, who only won four games last season, into AFC East champions in his first year as head coach.\n\nThe Patriots will face the Miami Dolphins this Sunday, with a chance to secure the No. 1 seed in the AFC.

    "fullText": "The Lakers underwent some soul-searching at practice Saturday, with coach JJ Redick starting the conversation before allowing players to speak freely about the team's issues.\n\nIt was an attempt by Redick and the team to prevent things from spiraling out of control after three consecutive losses.\n\nWhen the Lakers faced the Sacramento Kings on Sunday night at Crypto.com Arena, Redick wanted to see players executing on defense and playing harder.\n\nThe Lakers did exactly that, with Luka Doncic and LeBron James leading the way to a 125-101 win.\n\nFor the Lakers, it was more than Doncic finishing with 34 points, seven assists and five rebounds. It was Doncic playing defense, illustrated best when he blocked a shot by DeMar DeRozan. It was Doncic hustling, such as when he dove to the floor for a loose ball.\n\nIt was more than James scoring 24 points and handing out five assists. It was James throwing down a reverse dunk and offering words of wisdom to teammates.\n\nAnd it also was reserve Nick Smith Jr. finding a role in the rotation and producing, one of the six Lakers scoring in double figures. Smith had 21 points on eight-for-14 shooting, making five of 10 threes.\n\nRui Hachimura had 12 points, Deandre Ayton had 11 points and 11 rebounds, and Jake LaRavia had 11 points.\n\nThe Lakers (20-10) took control from the start of the third quarter, going on a 13-2 run to give them a 26-point lead that reached as high as 30 in the fourth quarter.\n\nGranted, the Kings (8-24) have the second-worst record in the West and were missing injured stars Zach LaVine, Domantas Sabonis and Keegan Bradley, three of their top four scorers.\n\nBut the Lakers lost three straight games because of poor defense and an overall effort that Redick described as \"terrible.\"\n\nAnd with Austin Reaves out for at least a month because of a calf strain, getting the chance to talk through their issues might end up changing the team's fortunes.\n\n\"They're trying, and you know, I told the guys, this is normal,\" Redick said. \"There's very few teams that don't hit troughs throughout the season. It's not all peaks. ... It's just a natural cycle that every team goes through.\n\n\"So we need to identify the problems and then come up with the solutions.

    "fullText": "Before the Chicago Bears could even take the field against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday night, they were declared the NFC North champions after the Green Bay Packers lost on Saturday night. Despite a tough 42-38 loss in prime-time, the Bears have locked down a home playoff game.\n\nThe Bears came into the weekend with a chance at being any of the top three seeds in the NFC. For this to be the first season under rookie head coach Ben Johnson, they’ve exceeded all expectations.\n\nThe 49ers are one of the teams competing for that top spot in the conference. It was a disastrous start for them and a perfect start for Chicago, however, as the first offensive play of the game was an interception returned for a touchdown by linebacker T.J. Edwards.\n\nFrom there, the teams exchanged touchdowns throughout. It is the first regular-season game in NFL history to be tied at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35. Tied up at 35, the Bears' defense got a stop for the first time in a while. The next offensive drive ended with just a field goal for the Bears, which was then answered by a 49ers touchdown to go up by four.\n\nWith 2:05 remaining in regulation time, quarterback Caleb Williams had another opportunity to create a game-winning drive for the Bears. Succeeding would've given Chicago a league-leading seven wins when trailing within the final two minutes of the fourth quarter. Although they had a chance, they ran out of time as they couldn't find the endzone on fourth-and-4 on the final play of the game.\n\nFor a young team, a rookie head coach, a second-year quarterback, and a roster loaded with injuries and illness, it was a valiant effort. They were not even supposed to be a playoff team this year, and they competed for the No. 1 seed in Week 17. They will be fine settling for the second or third seed as NFC North champions.\n\nAlthough the Bears' defense had a disastrous outing, this was a shootout from the beginning. The offense, which has tended to wait until the second half to play well, was incredible from the start.\n\nWilliams completed 25-of-42 passes for 330 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions or sacks. His top receiving target was receiver Luther Burden III, who had eight receptions for 138 yards and a score. Tight end Colston Loveland also deserves mention, as he had 94 yards on six receptions with a touchdown. The two rookies played incredibly and gave their quarterback a good target all game long.\n\nThe running game was solid. It wasn't as dominant as it normally is, but that is in part due to Williams picking apart the San Francisco defense. D'Andre Swift had nine carries for 54 yards, and two of those carries ended in the endzone. Rookie Kyle Monangai had 38 yards on eight carries.\n\nIn this game, Ben Johnson went against Kyle Shanahan. The latter has been one of the best offensive coaches in the NFL for a long time now, and Johnson is catching up quickly. They both deserve mentions in the \"Coach of the Year\" discussion, and they clearly have evenly matched teams coming out of this game.\n\nNext up for the Bears is their regular season finale against the Detroit Lions, who blew Chicago out in Week 2. Now, Detroit will pay a visit to Soldier Field. The Lions are eliminated from playoff contention, but they would love to make sure that the Bears end the season on a low note. Expect Chicago to prepare well ahead of a very important playoff dress rehearsal.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Bears vs. 49ers: Instant analysis from Chicago’s Week 17 loss",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Penn State Nittany Lions had their football season come to an end Saturday afternoon with a 22-10 win against the Clemson Tigersin the Pinstripe Bowl to finish a rollercoaster season at 7-6.\n\nSmith succeeded former Penn State coach James Franklin around midseason after Franklin's dismissal in State College resulted in failure to live up to their preseason College Football Playoff and national title expectations.\n\nSmith's coaching job may have been the most resilient of the entire season, having a chance to reflect on the experience before handing the keys to Matt Campbell.\n\n“We could have very well quit, but they didn’t,\" Smith said. \"They chose another path.\"\n\nSmith continued, as he held back tears both on TV and while speaking to reporters after the game.\n\n“I love this group,\" Smith said. \"They’re just a special group of guys. This is the greatest moment of my life.”\n\nSimply put, this was bigger than a singular win. This was a former player attempting to restore a program that needed a boost in the worst way.\n\n“I love Penn State,\" Smith said. \"I love football, and the game and Penn State have done amazing things for me and my family. I’m just thankful and grateful.”\n\nSmith says he has high hopes for Campbell to have immediate success as soon as next fall.\n\n“The communication has been terrific,” Smith said. “We’re just trying to piece together and retain roster and bring in new roster players. But he’s been very, very good. The guys that have come with him so far, they’ve been awesome, as well.”\n\nThere is still work to be done in Happy Valley, but if anything couldn't be clearer, the Nittany Lions are anything but irrelevant with Campbell now leading the way.",

    "fullText": "The Philadelphia Eagles have opened as 7.5-point home favorites against the Washington Commanders in Week 18, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nWe’ve yet to learn of the Eagles’ official intentions when it comes to playing starters or not but this line seems to suggest they’re not just going to fold with the No. 2 seed potentially available to them. Or maybe it’s about the Birds’ backups being able to beat Washington anyway.\n\nElsewhere of interest to the Eagles, the Chicago Bears are just 1.5-point home favorites against the Detroit Lions in Week 18. Surprised the Bears aren’t favored by more since they have motivation to win to secure the No. 2 seed and the Lions have already been eliminated from playoff contention. Seems like the odds-makers are expecting Dan Campbell’s team to put up a fight regardless.\n\nIf you parlay the Eagles’ moneyline and the Lions’ moneyline together, the odds for that scenario are +160. It’s not likely, no, but it’s hardly far-fetched.\n\nThe thinking here is the Eagles will be playing to win in Week 18. The Commanders might not merely lay down after not liking how Philly beat them in Week 16. But their effort might not matter much with Josh Johnson potentially starting at quarterback for them.\n\nI think the Eagles win and cover, perhaps even if Tanner McKee and the backups play most of the game.

    "description": "A blowout win that showed dominance, depth, and plenty of room to tighten things up as Gonzaga wins by 40 in Malibu.",
    "fullText": "Gonzaga opened West Coast Conference play Sunday night in Malibu by blowing the game open early and never letting it narrow. The 96-56 win over Pepperdine moves the Zags to 13-1 on the season and extended one of the longest win streaks in college basketball to 50-0 as the Waves kept searching for their first win over the Zags since 2002. The night nudged Gonzaga up to No. 4 in KenPom and pushed its defensive efficiency to second nationally, trailing only Michigan. It was a one-sided affair from start to finish, despite some ugly, ugly performances by a few Zags looking to get back on track and some stellar performances from a few now hitting their stride.\n\nPepperdine spent most of the night searching for a workable offense while failing to even theorize about a workable defense. The Waves shot 34 percent from the field (26 percent from deep), struggled to find space inside, and were outscored 50-18 in the paint despite Graham Ike and Braden Huff combining for just 23 of Gonzaga’s total points.\n\nThere were still moments that wandered and stretches that lacked polish, and games this lopsided tend to blur rather than sharpen evaluation, but Gonzaga’s night in Malibu left far more to build on than to pick apart.\n\nPepperdine struggled to create space against Gonzaga throughout the night, with most possessions ending in rushed decisions or heavily contested looks. Pepperdine’s Aaron Clark and Styles Phipps combined to go 3-for-22 on the night while the Waves finished 5-for-19 from three, a credit once again to the Emmanuel Innocenti/Jalen Warley combo that’s been locking everyone down from the perimeter. Similarly, turnovers piled up often enough to flip the floor, with Gonzaga converting 14 of them into 24 points. Much of the disruption came from activity around the rim, where Tyon Grant-Foster recorded a team-high four blocks, including a couple of recoveries that erased shots late in the possession after initial breakdowns. Throughout the game, there were moments where help arrived a beat late, particularly with Gonzaga cycling through unfamiliar lineups, but Pepperdine rarely capitalized, often settling for difficult jumpers rather than turning those openings into sustained offense. After going 4-for-10 from three in the first half, the Zags held the Waves to just 1-for-9 in the second.\n\nDefense to offense pic.twitter.com/eWPvfhDbJx\n\n— Gonzaga Basketball (@ZagMBB) December 29, 2025\n\nBraeden Smith was simply stellar against Pepperdine. Back in the starting lineup for the first time since the Arizona State game, he poured in 15 points in just 18 minutes, shooting 6-for-8 from the field while still stacking eight assists, grabbing five rebounds, and committing just one turnover. He opened the second half by scoring eight points in the first two and a half minutes, picking up right where he left off after dropping 22 against Oregon last week. Early in the season, Smith seemed a bit tentative moving the ball, managing pace, and trying to mirror the steadiness Ryan Nembhard brought to the position last year. Of late, however, he’s been playing his own game, the kind of game that made him Patriot League Player of the Year at Colgate. He’s been calling his own number without hesitation, turning the corner when lanes appeared, and forcing defenders to react to him rather than wait him out. That assertiveness pulled help higher, loosened coverages, and created space before the defense had a chance to settle, a dynamic that shifted the shape of Gonzaga’s offense possession by possession.\n\nBraeden Smith and @ZagMBB handle business in Malibu ✔️#WCChoops #WeRiseintheWest pic.twitter.com/K7BQ5qIKXe\n\n— West Coast Conference Basketball (@WCChoops) December 29, 2025\n\nAs good as Braeden Smith was, Mario Saint-Supery was… not. The Spanish freshman had one of those nights where nothing goes right. He still finished with four assists and four boards, but he also finished 1-for-7 from the field in 18 minutes off the bench, committed four turnovers, and somehow fouled out with roughly six minutes remaining in the second half. For reference, the new haircut probably cracked the top seven ‘Mario problems’ of the evening, but no higher. A week after seeing his name pop up on early 2026 draft boards, his stat line against Pepperdine is one he’d probably prefer to leave back in 2025.\n\nAll that being said, Saint-Supery is going to be fine. Saint Supery has been dealing with a rough flu bug, played only 13 minutes against Oregon last week, and is still feeling his way through the speed and physicality of college basketball in the U.S., a learning curve that rarely looks clean in the middle. The fouls came fast, a couple were extremely questionable, the turnovers snowballed, and the rhythm never arrived. It happens, especially to dudes who play with the kind of edge and urgency that Saint Supery has become known for. And he will bounce back.\n\nSiant-Supery’s burst, creativity, and comfort playing through uptempo chaos still fit naturally into Gonzaga’s offense, even if the timing has gone sideways for the moment. If anything, we now have a Super Mario bounce-back game to look forward to. And I predict it’ll happen sooner rather than later.\n\nIt was a quiet night from Gonzaga’s frontcourt, at least relative to the standard this group has set. The highest-scoring and most efficient big-man tandem in the country combined for 23 of Gonzaga’s 96 points, with Braden Huff finishing with 10 in 27 minutes and seeing his streak of 20-point games come to an end. Despite the decreased scoring load, the efficiency never wavered. Huff went 5-for-7 from the field and added four assists, and the usage felt deliberate, with coach Mark Few leaning into extended stretches of Huff going solo at the five while Graham Ike spent more time on the bench than he has been of late.\n\nTough stuff from B Huff pic.twitter.com/uCxEEzE4tK\n\n— Gonzaga Basketball (@ZagMBB) December 29, 2025\n\nIke also still filled the box score, posting another double-double with 13 points and 10 rebounds in 23 minutes while committing just a single foul. Even on a night where touches were limited and roles shifted, Gonzaga’s frontcourt stayed productive, efficient, and stable, which is about as much as you can ask from a group that has already carried such a heavy load this season.\n\n— Gonzaga Basketball (@ZagMBB) December 29, 2025\n\nTowards the middle of the second half, Ismaila Diagne got his first extended run of minutes in weeks. He’s still struggling to find the rim offensively, but it’s hard to complain about his seven rebounds (three offensive) in just 8 minutes.\n\nWith a quieter scoring night from the bigs, Gonzaga spent the evening seeing where else they could generate some production. Braeden Smith accounted for a lot of it, but the wings also shone against Pepperdine. Davis Fogle continued to turn short runs into real production, finishing with 15 points in just 16 minutes. He went 5-for-7 from the field, knocked down 2-for-3 from three, and added two offensive rebounds, again translating limited minutes into outsized output. His approach remains score-first and occasionally skews overly aggressive, but the buckets keep him on the floor. Each appearance looks a little steadier, a little more composed within the offense, a little more patient on defense, and the question surrounding his role feels increasingly tied to roster depth rather than readiness.\n\nThose minutes remain competitive because Tyon Grant-Foster delivered yet another full stat line against the Waves. He led Gonzaga with 18 points, missed just one shot all night, and added four blocks. There were defensive breakdowns and a few headlong drives towards the rim that ended in the muck, but the offensive possessions tended to resolve quickly when Grant-Foster had space to operate. The remaining challenge lies in fitting Grant-Foster’s style into the broader offensive structure while tightening the defensive reads, though Grant-Foster’s athleticism and versatility are impossible to keep on the bench when he’s producing at a high rate.\n\nAfter a few uneven outings, the Pepperdine game felt like the closest Grant-Foster’s come to channeling his explosiveness and athleticism into the offense instead of asking them to carry it.\n\nMario to Tyon pic.twitter.com/O50gpr0y9W\n\n— Gonzaga Basketball (@ZagMBB) December 29, 2025\n\nThis was a good win, even if it never felt especially clean. Gonzaga rarely looks fully formed in late December, and this time of year tends to bring uneven stretches no matter who’s on the other side. The larger factor, though, was the opponent. Pepperdine’s offensive limitations made it strangely difficult to look sharp while winning by 40.\n\nSpin cycle pic.twitter.com/MqIA0A8FGv\n\n— Gonzaga Basketball (@ZagMBB) December 29, 2025\n\nFoul trouble and dead-ball stretches pushed Gonzaga into a handful of unfamiliar lineup combinations (Adam Miller playing point guard? Davis Fogle at the four?), rhythm never really settled, and pace came and went in short waves rather than building across long stretches. Coming off a non-conference slate that demanded something close to full attention every night, it also looked like a group carrying some fatigue, both physical and mental, even as the margin kept expanding.\n\nAnd still, the numbers stacked up. Another blowout, another pile of efficient stat lines, another night where the flaws were visible without ever threatening the outcome. That combination has become familiar. Gonzaga keeps winning big while leaving room for improvement, dominating games that feel loose in real time and then look like bloodbaths when you check the box score. The fact that this team can do that, and still feel unfinished, remains one of the more thrilling parts of where the season sits right now.\n\nThe Zags now head to San Diego to take on the Toreros on Tuesday, December 30. Tip-off scheduled for 6:30 PST, coverage provided by KHQ locally and ESPN+ nationally.",

    "fullText": "Bears’ future on display as Williams–Loveland chemistry shines in narrow loss originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe connection between Caleb Williams and Colston Loveland continues to show promise for the Chicago Bears.\n\nThe pair delivered again Sunday night against the San Francisco 49ers, even though Chicago came up just short in a 42–38 loss that wasn’t decided until the final play near the goal line.\n\nLoveland drew a season-high 10 targets, finishing with six catches for 94 yards. His night included a 36-yard touchdown reception from Williams in the second quarter.\n\nLoveland was also open on the game’s final snap. As Williams extended the play, film showed the rookie tight end breaking free in the back of the end zone, creating a brief window where the throw was there to be made.\n\nThat chemistry matters for Chicago’s future. Williams and Loveland are the Bears’ last two first-round picks, and the offense is built around their ability to grow together. Loveland’s best outing this season came in Week 7 against Cincinnati, when he posted six catches for 118 yards and two touchdowns. After that, the rookie averaged just 42 receiving yards over the next seven games before rebounding Sunday night.\n\nThrough 17 weeks, Loveland has totaled 622 yards on 69 receptions with four touchdowns. Williams finished the loss 25-of-42 for 330 yards and two scores. He now needs 270 passing yards in Week 18 to become the first quarterback in franchise history to reach 4,000 yards in a season.\n\nWith one week remaining, the Bears have already clinched the NFC North but are eliminated from contention for the No. 1 seed. Chicago hosts Detroit in Week 18 with positioning still at stake, as the Bears look to secure the No. 2 seed rather than slipping to No. 3.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City won their eighth consecutive match in all competitions when they beat Nottingham Forest 2-1 at The City Ground on Saturday. Pep Guardiola’s team’s spirit and determination shone through, and it helped them overcome a tough opponent on Saturday. It does stand out that there is spirit and energy back in this City squad after a tough 24/25 season for Pep Guardiola’s side. Speaking after his team’s important win over Nottingham Forest, Pep Guardiola has identified one specific moment that has been key in his team’s revival.\n\nSpeaking after his team’s win over Nottingham Forest, Pep Guardiola shared his belief that Manchester City’s time in the United States during their FIFA Club World Cup campaign last summer has played a key role in his team’s growth. Guardiola explained: “When we went out to Al-Hilal, it wasn’t the fact we didn’t win the Club World Cup – it was the fact we were so good there. It wasn’t holidays. I was annoyed because we were good there.”\n\n“Good in the training, the players in Boca Raton, in front of the beach, everyone was happy, we made a lot of dinners, a lot of talks on what was going to happen this season. And we wanted to extend to live there.”\n\n“But after that, I spoke with Pep (Lijnders), James (French), Manel (Estiarte), Hugo (Viana), Txiki (Begiristain), and something changed.”\n\n“It doesn’t mean we’re going to win but to recognise a team who can do eight wins in a row and compete in the way we do it.”\n\nManchester City was quick to point out that last summer’s FIFA Club World Cup was the beginning of a new season. It was a fresh start for Pep Guardiola’s side after a trying and testing 24/25 season. Although City went out of the tournament earlier than they would’ve liked at the hands of Al-Hilal, the benefits of City’s participation are clear to see.\n\nManchester City’s new signings and coaches had the opportunity to work together for the first time. The tournament was also a chance for the new-look Manchester City side to bond and build the team spirit that has been key to Manchester City’s play this season. That process began way back at the FIFA Club World Cup. There is still improvement to come in Manchester City’s play but the spirit that defines this City team has continued to grow since the seeds were planted in the United States.\n\nPep Guardiola believes that Manchester City’s FIFA Club World Cup campaign has played a key role in his team’s resurgence this season. The opportunity to get away and work together proved to be invaluable for the Manchester City players and staff. A strong team spirit was formed in the United States and it has shone through throughout Manchester City’s recent eight-match ubeaten run.",

    "fullText": "What Manchester United need most right now is an elite defensive midfielder capable of fitting into Ruben Amorim’s tactical plan.\n\nA high-intensity player, something Casemiro no longer is, despite his resurgence. Manuel Ugarte impressed against Newcastle, but even he has flattered to deceive since joining the club.\n\nINEOS are prepared to cut him loose, while the injured Kobbie Mainoo is not seen as a defensive midfielder by the head coach.\n\nCarlos Baleba of Brighton and Hove Albion was identified as a target last summer, but his price tag proved prohibitive.\n\nSince then, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson have joined him on the list, but all three are unlikely to move mid-season.\n\nThat means a short-term deal might be the only feasible solution. Ruben Neves, formerly of Wolverhampton Wanderers, and ex-Carrington graduate James Garner have emerged as alternatives.\n\nThe Portugal international’s wages might prove to be a stumbling block, while Everton are in no mood to lose the former United wonderkid.\n\nTeamtalk have now revealed that the 20-time English league champions have made aware of the terms of a potential January deal for Leon Goretzka.\n\n“We are starting to hear about new targets for United now so it looks like there will be an attempt to sign a midfield player outside of the likes of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba.\n\n“[Roma’s] Manu Kone is a name that has started to crop up and I think they have been made aware of the terms for signing [Bayern Munich’s] Leon Goretzka.”\n\nThe Bayern Munich midfielder has long been linked with a move to Old Trafford, but his age and waning influence have meant a move has never materialised.\n\nThe German started only 13 times in the Bundesliga last season, while this term, he has failed to start a game in the Champions League while finishing a match only on three occasions.\n\nThe 30-year-old’s contract ends next summer, and it makes very little sense to sign Leon Goretzka for a fee in the winter window.\n\nFeature image Stuart Franklin via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Redick believes the Lakers' win against the Kings is their most impressive of the season originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers were on a three-game losing streak over the past week, which led head coach J.J. Redick to call out his team. After the Christmas Day loss to the Houston Rockets, it was apparent that the Lakers needed a win.\n\nThey got a solid victory against the Sacramento Kings with a 125-101 result. This was one of the most well-rounded results of the year, as the Lakers won every single quarter. Luka Doncic was excellent once again, while LeBron James had the most efficient performance of his Lakers career.\n\nRedick is correct to be impressed by the performance because they deserve to be praised. The Lakers came into this game against the Kings with a mission, and that is to have a bounce-back night. It was rough for the Lakers to go through that losing stretch, especially since Austin Reaves also suffered an injury.\n\nMoving forward, this could be the model that the Lakers follow, as they want to keep fighting and winning. The game against the Kings was a show of dominance for the Lakers, as Doncic and James took over. Even Nick Smith Jr. had an impressive night filling in for Reaves.\n\nMore: Lakers head coach J.J. Redick sees Nick Smith Jr. playing a big role after Reaves injury\n\n\"We played together, we played for each other. We had probably one of our most consistent games, in terms of 48 minutes of pure competitiveness... This is the first game we've had all year that we've won all four quarters. That says a lot about the approach and the consistent mentality we played tonight,\" Redick said about the performance.\n\nAs long as the Lakers can perform to the highest level on both ends of the floor, they can properly climb the Western Conference standings. It will be a challenging time for the Lakers, as most teams would love to beat them.\n\nWith Doncic and James clicking, the Lakers have become more dangerous. Of course, losing Reaves was big, but the Lakers are becoming known for delivering perfect responses to losses. The Lakers fans would prefer not to lose games, but it was useful because Redick's team learned from their mistakes.\n\nLeBron James Reacts to Russell Westbrook Milestone Before Kings-Lakers\n\nLakers' LeBron James shot a 3-pointer left-handed, and it went as well as you'd expect\n\nJ.J.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOne year removed from their Super Bowl triumph, the Eagles find themselves near the top of the NFC.\n\nThe season hasn't been nearly as wondrous as last year. Philadelphia has been felled by bouts of inconsistency at different points, with quarterback Jalen Hurts going through a middling stretch halfway through the year as losses piled up.\n\nStill, Nick Sirianni's bunch remains in the mix, taking advantage of a weak division to rack up wins. Given its championship pedigree, Philly remains a dangerous threat in the postseason -- even if Hurts didn't look the part throughout the year.\n\nThere was no better evidence of the Eagles' might than their 13-12 win over the Bills on Sunday. Their attack was quiet, as it has been throughout the year. But that harrowing defense flexed its strength when it needed to. Performances like that translate well to winter football. Sirianni's team knows that better than most.\n\nHere's a look at Philadelphia's playoff picture following its win on Sunday.\n\nWith the Seahawks' win over the Panthers, the Eagles are officially unable to capture the NFC's No. 1 seed. They can only finish with 12 wins on the season, one short of Seattle's current mark. After the 49ers' win over the Bears Sunday night, San Francisco can leapfrog Philadelphia for first-place in the NFC standings with a win over Seattle on Saturday.\n\nThe Eagles aren't quite fixed to the No. 3 seed.

    "description": "The Buffalo Bills may play their final game in the original Highmark Stadium on Sunday, January 4.",
    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills finish up the 2025 NFL regular season with a home game against the New York Jets in Week 18. It’s also very likely set to become the final game in their current stadium, Highmark Stadium — which is also lovingly referred to as “The Ralph” after late founding Bills owner Ralph C. Wilson Jr.\n\nTo mark the occasion, One Bills Drive will welcome Bills Mafia and those otherwise for kickoff at 4:05 p.m. EST on Sunday, January 4, 2026. With much of Buffalo’s playoff options already in place, there’s little more to play for in Week 18 than perhaps a move up from their current status as the seven seed in the AFC playoff bracket. With a win, they could improve to the six seed if things go their way elsewhere on the scoreboard in Week 18.\n\nShould that happen, and if the Bills manage to go on a healthy winning streak in the postseason, it’s possible Buffalo could make its way back to hosting one more game to send their home for the last 52 seasons off into a proper playoff-tinged sunset.\n\nNext weekend’s regular-season finale once held lots of potential drama, with the Bills still in contention to win the AFC East until coming up short at the end of regulation against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 17. A win would have given Buffalo plenty of reason to focus on defeating the Jets in hopes of claiming the AFC East division crown. Instead, with the division title headed to Foxborough, MA, the team may choose to rest key starters for most of or the entirety of next Sunday’s game.\n\nThere are certain players who may still suit up in an effort to hit certain performance-based incentives, while others look to continue streaks and build toward franchise and/or NFL records. Yet, it’s possible this game features more backups than typical as the Bills turn their attention to the playoffs.\n\nTo celebrate the history of what began architectural life as Rich Stadium, the Bills unveiled alternate red helmets in homage to the Super Bowl teams that dominated the NFL in the 1990s. Buffalo is set to wear those helmets against the Jets on Sunday in what could be the last game in Orchard Park, NY before the new Highmark Stadium opens late in the summer of 2026.",

    "fullText": "The final Sunday in 2025 provided football fans with a memorable game that featured plenty of offensive firepower.\n\nWith how the Chicago Bears and San Francisco 49ers moved the ball and scored, it felt like a game that would end with whatever team had the ball last.\n\nCaleb Williams and the Bears had their shot with 2:15 left in the game, down by four points.\n\nThe Bears quarterback led his team on a 15-play drive that ended on the 49ers’ 2-yard line after Williams attempted to extend the play to find an open receiver. With the 49ers’ defense closing in, Williams threw a pass into the end zone, but it fell short.\n\nWild ending to an incredible game. pic.twitter.com/Xe6pJkBfEa\n\nThe Bears lost 42-38, which eliminates them from contention for the NFC’s No. 1 playoff seed. Still, as NFC North champions, they will host at least one playoff game at Soldier Field.\n\nHere are the five players who raised and lowered their stock in the Week 17 shootout at Levi’s Stadium.\n\nWilliams had one of his best passing performances of the season, completing 25 of 42 throws for 330 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nHis first TD pass of the day — to rookie Luther Burden III — was a perfectly thrown 35-yard strike in the first quarter.\n\nCaleb Williams drops it in a basket for the Luther Burden III touchdown\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nWilliams’ second TD pass — to Colston Loveland in the second quarter– displayed some of his elite quarterback traits. Williams drew the 49ers’ defense offside with his cadence, kept his eyes downfield after the snap, then threw a dart to his rookie tight end for a 36-yard score.\n\nCaleb Williams gets the 49ers on the hard count.\n\nTouchdown, Colston Loveland\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nWith how well the 49ers’ offense played, Williams needed to match Brock Purdy on the other side. For a majority of the game, that’s exactly what he did. However, he missed some throws.\n\nOn the final drive, Williams was heavily pressured on a first-and-10 play. He ran away from the pressure to his right but couldn’t complete a pass to wide-open Devin Duvernay on what might have been a game-winning TD.\n\nthis was 7 pic.twitter.com/WzuR5ONtEM\n\n— Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) December 29, 2025\n\nIt only took one play for the former All-Pro cornerback to change the game.\n\nJohnson jumped Jauan Jennings’ slant route and deflected Purdy’s first pass on the first play of the game into the air. T.J. Edwards intercepted the ball and returned it 34 yards for a pick six.\n\nT.J. EDWARDS, PICK-SIX ON THE FIRST PLAY OF THE GAME\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nJohnson finished the game with zero receptions allowed on one target. He wasn’t targeted for the remainder of the game after helping cause the pick six, but he also played limited snaps in the second half.\n\nJohnson has given up just seven receptions on 12 targets for 142 yards in six games this season, and he has one interception. It shows just how important keeping Johnson healthy is to the Bears’ defense.\n\nThe Bears’ rookie wide receiver returned to action after missing last week’s win over the Green Bay Packers and quickly made an impact.\n\nEntering their third drive, the Bears had failed to record a first down. Then Williams found Burden for a 10-yard gain on second down. Three plays later, Williams connected with Burden on an explosive 35-yard TD pass, giving Chicago’s offense its first points of the game late in the first quarter.\n\nCaleb Williams drops it in a basket for the Luther Burden III touchdown\n\n— Marquee Sports Network (@WatchMarquee) December 29, 2025\n\nBurden finished as the game’s leading receiver with eight receptions on nine targets for 138 yards and the TD. He was injured on the final play of the game, and head coach Ben Johnson didn’t have an immediate update on the rookie’s condition.\n\nThe Bears’ veteran linebacker had the daunting task of trying to contain Christian McCaffrey. The entire defense, especially Edmunds, failed to keep the 49ers’ versatile playmaker in check.\n\nMcCaffrey finished the first half with 18 carries for 121 yards and one TD. He added two receptions for 20 yards as a pass catcher before halftime.\n\n: NBC\nNFL+// https://t.co/Zkva0Y3QRRpic.twitter.com/Lw0glXcnaP\n\n— San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) December 29, 2025\n\nPer Pro Football Focus, Edmunds allowed seven receptions on seven targets for 55 yards and two TDs.\n\nThe 49ers’ offense, which features plenty of motions and shifts, forced Edmunds and the rest of the Bears’ defensive front to react slowly, and San Francisco benefited throughout the game, finishing with 496 total yards (200 rushing, 296 passing).\n\nThe Bears cornerback dealt with a hamstring injury and an illness throughout the week, but he was able to start against the 49ers.\n\nHe’s had a remarkable season, but this wasn’t a good showing.

    "fullText": "49ers playoff picture: How win over Bears impacts NFC West race, San Francisco's chances at No. 1 seed originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 49ers embraced the spotlight on Sunday night, in front of a raucous San Francisco faithful en route to a 42-38 win over the Bears.\n\nThe result was a momentous one for Kyle Shanahan's bunch. Not only did it cement the 49ers as true NFC contenders. But it also pushed San Francisco one step closer to NFC West and conference supremacy.\n\nBrock Purdy dazzled against Chicago's highly-touted defense, producing five touchdowns — and even more highlights — in an epic showcase. With a game against the NFC-leading Seahawks in Week 18, the Niners will need him to pull a rabbit out of his hat once more.\n\nHere's what you need to know about San Francisco's playoff prospects following its win over the Bears.\n\nMORE: How Seahawks, Bears and more can clinch NFC's No. 1 seed\n\nThe Niners' win on \"Sunday Night Football\" confirms that the NFC West crown and the NFC's No. 1 seed will be up for grabs in Week 18.\n\nThe result sets up nicely for hardcore observers and casual viewers alike. San Francisco is set to take on NFC pace-setters the Seahawks on Saturday night. The win effectively freezes the Rams out of NFC West contention as Los Angeles falls short of both the 49ers and Seahawks in tiebreakers.\n\nSimply, the winner of next weekend's duel will hoist the NFC West title. They'll get quite the reward as a result — home-field advantage throughout the postseason.\n\n*indicates a team has clinched a playoff berth.\n\nThe 49ers' win keeps them in the top spot among wild-card teams. They're currently slated to travel to Carolina to take on the Panthers in the first round of the postseason, although that could change depending on the results of their duel with Seattle.\n\nUpdated AFC, NFC standings in NFL playoff picture for Week 17\n\nHow Giants-Raiders Week 17 matchup likely decides No. 1 overall pick\n\nTexans, Packers among latest teams to clinch spot in NFL postseason\n\nSan Francisco sits in second-place in the NFC West standings upon the conclusion of Sunday night's contest. The Niners are one game short of division-leading Seattle, although it can turn back that disadvantage with a victory against the Seahawks on Saturday.\n\nLos Angeles, meanwhile, will have to settle for third-place in the division at the end of Week 17. The Rams can still surpass San Francisco should the 49ers lose to Seattle in Week 18 (and Los Angeles beats the Falcons in Week 17). However, if they finish with an identical record to their divisional counterparts, they'll fall short as a result of tiebreakers.\n\nSan Francisco has one game left in its regular season slate: a home clash with the Seahawks. Suffice to say, that matchup will have a major impact on the postseason bracket — the winner will win the NFC West and claim the NFC's top seed.",

But he did praise Sitake’s feat.\n\n“The man is a beast!” Chestnut replied to Hansen’s post. “And that trophy is next level.”\n\nThe man is a beast!!! And that trophy is next level.\n\n— Joey Chestnut (@joeyjaws) December 28, 2025\n\nOne of Chestnut’s most notable records is downing 76 hot dogs in 10 minutes — buns included.\n\nPer the Major League Eating website, other world records include 182 chicken wings in 30 minutes; 103 Krystal hamburgers in 8 minutes; 12 pounds of deep-fried asparagus spears in 10 minutes; 13.76 pounds of pork ribs in 12 minutes; 14.5 pounds of burritos in 10 minutes; and 121 Twinkies in 6 minutes.\n\nAnd while it wasn’t an official Major League Eating competition, Chestnut devoured 100 Pop-Tarts (10 different flavors) in roughly 30 minutes during a 2020 YouTube livestream.\n\nBut don’t count on a Chestnut vs. Sitake Pop-Tart matchup anytime soon; Chestnut considers Pop-Tarts to be one of the worst food challenges of his career.\n\n“It was terrible. I thought it would be delicious, start to end, but it got really, really old really quickly,” he told Mashed in 2020. “They got super dry, it tore up my mouth, it took me longer. It was not as enjoyable as I thought it would be.”",

That ties the longest streak in NFL history.\n\nThe Steelers lost to the 2-10-1 Bengals in 2020 (Pittsburgh entered the game 11-2), they tied the 0-8 Lions in 2021 (the Steelers entered the game 5-3), they lost to the 2-10 Cardinals in 2023 (Pittsburgh was 7-4), they lost to the 2-10 Patriots the very next week in 2023 (7-5), and they lost on Sunday to the 3-12 Browns (9-6).\n\nWhile many players have changed since 2020, there are some constants, both on the roster and the coaching staff (starting with, obviously, head coach Mike Tomlin). The situation speaks to the habit of overlooking a subpar foe, losing just enough focus to not beat them.\n\nFortunately for the Steelers, they won't be facing any more teams with bad records, either next week or in the postseason, if they can beat the 8-8 Ravens and qualify for the playoffs.

Metcalf, failing to score a touchdown for the first time all season. All they managed was a pair of Chris Boswell field goals in the second quarter before getting shut out for the entire second half.\n\nAfter starting December 3-0 with three strong performances, Aaron Rodgers endured his worst game in four weeks. The 42-year-old QB looked his age, completing only 21 of 39 passes for 168 yards and no touchdowns.\n\nRodgers was sacked twice, but not by Myles Garrett, who was held without a sack in both of his games against Pittsburgh this year. He remains 0.5 sacks shy of the NFL single-season record of 22.5, which he’ll try to break in the Browns’ season finale against the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nAfter the game, Garrett criticized the Steelers for seeming more focused on stopping him rather than winning the game.\n\n#Browns DE Myles Garrett on the #Browns win vs. the #Steelers:\n\n“They were more worried about keeping me away from Aaron (Rodgers) than getting the win.

Rodgers was getting the ball out quickly rather than letting plays develop, and Garrett may have been in his head.\n\nGarrett is one of the rare defensive players in the NFL who can impact a game with his mere presence, and that may have been the case on Sunday.\n\nRegardless, now the Steelers must beat the Baltimore Ravens at home next week if they want to make the playoffs.

    "description": "Simon Adingra and Dominic Calvert-Lewin chipped in as the Lads drew with Leeds. What did our writers make of the game?",
    "fullText": "Firstly, I hope everyone had a brilliant Christmas and has an excellent year ahead!\n\nHe needed it. For me he’s been so hit and miss since we signed him, but he was brilliant.\n\nThe first touch that set up the goal was superb and the finish was equally as good. Let’s hope this is the start of the things to come!\n\nAnother good week up top for the big man, with a brilliant first half, which just lacked the goal.\n\nHe definitely could’ve done better with the header but you can’t fault his ability to hold the ball up and bully defenders.\n\nPoor Dan. Apart from Granit Xhaka, he’s been my player of the season.\n\nI do hope the reports of a five-week layoff are extremely wide of the mark as we have some tough games coming up — and I do think Omar Alderete looks more comfortable alongside him rather than Nordi Mukiele.\n\nI’m a little concerned in the lack of chances we’re creating in or around the box.\n\nThe last five minutes of the game we rushed passes or were too safe — Enzo Le Fée’s first-time cross hitting a defender when in acres of space is a case in point.\n\nWe came out a little better against Brighton before quickly dropping off, but on Sunday, we were awful after the break; Leeds ran us ragged for the majority of it and we looked terrible out of possession.\n\nLuckily, for the second week in a row, poor finishing from the opposition ensured we left with a point.\n\nWe’ve reached the end of the calendar year unbeaten at home on our return to the Premier League — which can only breed confidence among the squad and offer great encouragement to the fans.\n\nThirty points and fifth spot would’ve been nice but hey ho — mustn’t grumble!\n\nLutsharel Geertruida was outstanding and stood out amongst several bright performances.\n\nGreat to see Simon Adingra curling that beautiful goal in, and other notable mentions should be given to a returning Dennis Cirkin and Enzo Le Fée, who never stopped running.\n\nI also thought Eliezer Mayenda offered something different at the end.\n\nThere were several times when our passing just didn’t come off.\n\nBrian Brobbey was guilty in the first half of not being on the same page as his team mates on at least three occasions, and even Granit Xhaka was guilty of some sloppy passes.\n\nIt was one of those days when things just didn’t quite work.\n\nSitting as I do in the north east corner, I’m used to having to listen to the away fans giving it large. Unfortunately, we didn’t manage to shut the Leeds fans up and they remained buoyant throughout.\n\nProbably the loudest away fans this season — and this may be linked to the exodus from some of our fans with five minutes to go. I thought we’d seen the last of this annoying habit.\n\nOnly ourselves and the league leaders can boast an unbeaten home record — and long may it continue.\n\nIt’s some feat and although we often had our backs to the wall, the Lads kept believing and Régis Le Bris changed things at the right time.\n\nBrian Brobbey was immense in the first half and deserved to score late on in the half.\n\nHe’s a real handful and will continue to be so. He was too isolated after the break and a change of shape was needed, but his contribution is and will be immense.\n\nWe have to hope his ankle isn’t badly damaged as his value to this side was clear to see in his absence.\n\nThe back four were good but he adds physicality and I think the lads around him are better players for it.\n\nWe had a really good first half but looked like we’d left the intensity in the dressing room when we came back out.\n\nWe conceded one but for the first twenty minutes of the second half, we struggled to get back into the game. Leeds’ poor finishing and decision-making helped us out but we need to keep the intensity up — maybe the fact we have the lads at AFCON and that Ballard was out has put too much onto the eleven we’re putting out week on week.\n\nBurnout might be an issue as the season progresses, so rotation will be key.\n\nSunderland came out of the traps at the start of the campaign in a totally unexpected fashion, with a mixture of flair, determination and mild abrasiveness which identifies us as potential qualifiers for European competition.\n\nWhile we were clearly missing some of our seven absent players, Leeds played surprisingly well, especially in midfield.\n\nThey took a leaf from our playbook and played in a style that was very reminiscent of ours. Imitation is a sincere form of flattery.\n\nWe didn’t collapse despite some very good play from the visitors.\n\nSimon Adingra’s goal was excellent but around the seventy-minute mark I messaged a friend “We’re somehow holding on. Need to get the ball forward quicker to Mayenda and Isidor. Missing the seven players who are out”.\n\nHowever, the satisfying part is that we survived significant Leeds pressure and even created some half-chances at the end. This has been a hallmark of Sunderland’s season: resilience, as well as keeping our shape and focus.\n\nDan Ballard’s absence showed what a massive impact we’ve got used to from him every week — both as an excellent defender but also as an attacking threat.\n\nIt’s an open question as to whether Luke O’Nien would’ve been selected if available, and recruiting a top centre back may become a priority if Ballard proves fragile in terms of recovery from injuries.\n\nThere was also some untidy play.\n\nIn left midfield, Adingra was the exception but Enzo Le Fée was quieter than usual, and even Granit Xhaka wasn’t his dominant self. The defence did OK but Dennis Cirkin took time to settle and Trai Hume was walking a tightrope in terms of fouls, picking up his fourth booking of the season.\n\nSo nothing terrible — just some cause for concern which needs to be addressed in preparation for Manchester City.\n\nBrobbey was immense in the first half.\n\nA veritable battering ram, he swatted off Leeds defenders like flies.\n\nAdingra’s running and his goal were superb, and Cirkin fitted in well, much to my surprise.\n\nWe lost control of midfield in the second half and wayward passing almost handed Leeds a second goal.\n\nThe loss of Dan Ballard was sorely felt — I don’t think Dominic Calvert-Lewin scores that goal if Ballard was playing.\n\nFailure to convert chances is costing us. Two gilt-edged chances went begging at the end of the first half and if ever we needed a second goal, it was yesterday.\n\nLeeds are no mugs and a draw was probably a fair result, but there were chances for both sides to win the match.",

    "fullText": "OCEANSIDE -- Entering the second game of their back-to-back against the Sioux Falls Skyforce, TyTy Washington Jr. was converted from a standard G League contract with the San Diego Clippers to a Two-way spot with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nHe now occupies the spot previously held by RayJ Dennis, who was waived in the same transaction. Whether Dennis will return to San Diego on a standard G League contract is not known yet, but the Clippers do own his G League rights.\n\nWashington Jr. fills the third Two-way spot Los Angeles has, alongside Jordan Miller and Kobe Sanders. The latter two have yet to suit up for San Diego this season, as they've been on LAC duties due to injuries and roster inconsistency.\n\nThe 24 year-old guard in his stint for the Clippers averaged 19.9 points, 5.8 assists, 5.1 rebounds, and 1.7 steals over 36.1 minutes per game through 16 games. He really put his name on the map and essentially forced LA's hand to sign him after averaging 34 points, eight rebounds, five assists, and three steals per game during the NBA G League Winter Showcase.\n\nBack in the NBA!

He's been killing it down here in the G League. I think we've played 15, 16 games or something like that and he's been a monster in every single one of them,\" said Clippers forward Zach Freemantle.\n\nHe also noted that Washington Jr.'s hardwork being noticed and recognized is a good thing and that he deserves the call up.\n\nTyTy Washington Jr has been signed to the LA Clippers on a two-way contract. He replaced RayJ Dennis who was subsequently waived. San Diego will be shorthanded tonight against Miami's G League team -- Story later tonight\n\n— Jared Knobloch (@jknobloch8) December 29, 2025\n\nWith all the two-way players with Los Angeles, and no players on assignment (i.e. Yanic Konan Niderhouser), that left San Diego shorthanded against the Skyforce with only eight active players.\n\nBeing shorthanded, they ended up losing in a close game against Sioux Falls 101-98. The Clippers fall to 1-3 in the regular season, a stark difference from their 9-5 record during the Tip-off tournament.\n\nDespite the loss, Freemantle had a career-high 32 points, along with 10 rebounds. \"I was just trying to do whatever I could to help my team win,\" he said. \"There was some opportunity for me to score the ball tonight, and I just tried to take advantage of what the game gave me.\"\n\nFREEEEEEEEMANTLE pic.twitter.com/s9SovKnjPn\n\n— SD Clippers (@sandiego_clips) December 29, 2025\n\nThe Clippers will have some time off before having a rematch with the Raptors 905 on January 2.

    "description": "Malc Dugdale reports on a gritty Sunday afternoon affair at the Stadium of Light — a fair result, all things considered?",
    "fullText": "When the news came out that Dan Ballard wasn’t fit enough to make the starting eleven for Leeds’ visit, a lot of concerns arose for many, but in the end we did a decent job in defence.\n\nThere were extended periods — especially in the second half — where it was very much “backs against the wall”, and the lads who had to cover for both the AFCON losses and the Ballard-sized gap did very well.\n\nIt’s a real shame that we’ve potentially lost the big Northern Irish international for four weeks or so, but apart from losing Dominic Calvert-Lewin for a high-quality run in between the centre backs that met a very good cross, the lads who stepped up at short notice did very well.\n\nIt was clear that Dennis Cirkin tired late on and with more quality options on the bench, maybe he would’ve been replaced, but we defended steadfastly at times (that save off the line from Trai Hume was massive), and we deserved the point we earned in the end.\n\nIt was mentioned on Haway The Podcast that Simon Adingra has taken his omission from the Ivory Coast squad quite hard and that he’s really stepped up his training to grab this chance to shine — and how he shone with that finish just before the half-hour mark!\n\nIf he wants to grab the attention of his national coach, he did exactly the right thing by scoring his first Premier League goal for the Lads, and what a belter it was.\n\nThe ball from Granit Xhaka was an absolute peach but the touch and curled effort just inside the post was a thing of beauty. Adingra was one of the best players on the pitch and after his unconvincing showing at Brighton, he really took his game to the Leeds defence — especially in the first period.\n\nHe was massively unlucky in the dying moments of the first half when an excellent cross to Brian Brobbey at the back post only managed to rattle the corner of post and bar. If that had led to an assist and goal, he would’ve deserved it.\n\nIf this is the start of Adingra really showing what he can do, we have a lot to be grateful for as he didn’t head to Africa for the competition he’s missing out on.\n\nElsewhere, I was a little surprised to see Chris Rigg start and while he had a decent enough game and made some good contributions at times, I do think what Eliezer Mayenda offered when he came on was a level above.\n\nRigg did OK and his tackle to win the ball back about twenty minutes in was what every Sunderland fan wants to see. That said, Mayenda came on, offered so much \n\nThe run he made on the seventy-fifth minute was a glimpse of what we’ve missed and something we don’t really get from Rigg.\n\nIt’ll be interesting to see how this pans out as Rigg is clearly doing something to impress the coach, but when we have less of the physicality from the AFCON lads on the park, making up for that with Mayenda rather than Rigg makes a lot of sense to me.\n\nUp front, I was really happy with the hold-up play from Brian Brobbey and on another day, he could’ve had a goal or two.\n\nHis physicality and strength with his back to goal created a load of issues, and when he and Adingra both committed fully to tackles and put Joe Rodon off the park, the grit of the big number nine had an even bigger impact — and quite legally so.\n\nI thought there was a half-decent shout for a very advanced free kick or penalty on one or two occasions — including not long before he hit the bar with a header — but that wasn’t to be. I’m not sure if the referee wanted to give anything to the home side but with the graft and muscle that Brobbey put in, it showed me why he’s currently preferred to Wilson Isidor.\n\nHowever, given the lack of goals from both Brobbey and Isidor, I do think we may dip into the transfer market in January.\n\nIf Mayenda isn’t seen as an attacking option and the two lads aren’t scoring often enough, we could do with another player up top to make sure we hit thirty five points as soon as possible in 2026, and kick on from there.\n\nWe could easily have lost that game and with a handful of players away on international duty and star players like Dan Ballard unavailable at short notice, to keep our unbeaten home record into 2026 and not let in any of the barrage of attempts which Leeds created in the second half represents a point gained rather than two lost.\n\nLeeds did a good job and much like the fixtures in the Championship, there was very little to separate the two teams — nor the tactics the two coaches used to counteract each other.\n\nThere were times when we were far too wasteful with the ball and times when we should’ve shot rather than overplayed the build up — such as the chance for Lutsharel Geertruida inside the first twenty minutes.\n\nThere were also times when we stood off too much (including in the buildup to the Leeds goal) and many points when we had to dig in and do all we could not to lose, but we got a point — which we deserved — and we move on to the next one.\n\nIf we can continue to build points with great goals like that and last-ditch defending, despite all the challenges thrown at us, we’ll be in the mix for the top ten or even top six to eight come the end of the season.",

    "fullText": "You could point at quite a few games like this during the relegation of 1990-91, but this one sums up how it went quite nicely. We shouldn’t forget that it was one of those relegations where you were still proud of the Lads and considering how many of the side started out with us in Division Three, it was a heroic effort to stay up.\n\nAfter a good start that included a home win over Manchester United and a draw against Division One’s glamour side Tottenham Hotspur at Roker, where Gary Lineker and Paul Gascoigne rocked up only weeks after heartbreak at Italia 90’.\n\nSoon after, we began a trend of losing leads or throwing away a point by conceding a late goal. Everton at Roker, Wimbledon away, Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Manchester City at home, Spurs away, Norwich back on home soi,l and Palace on the road were all games where this occurred before we come to the fixture back on this day in 1990.\n\nAll of this surrendering of points meant we sat one point and one place above the side who occupied the last remaining relegation place, and yep, you guessed it – it was Don Howe’s Queens Park Rangers.\n\nThis was a proper six-pointer and since the Palace game at Selhurst Park was only three days prior to this and we had taken nothing from a game we were winning with around ten minutes to go, you might have thought we learnt our lesson.\n\nAn injury to Marco Gabbiadini meant that David Rush continued to partner new-boy Peter Davenport up top but after around twenty minutes at Loftus Road, the former Manchester United striker could play no further part after picking up a knock, which meant we now had the inexperienced forward line of Rush and Warren Hawke.\n\nHowever, five minutes after the change, a Tony Norman goal kick was flicked on by Gordon Armstrong and Rush was through on goal until he was brought down by QPR keeper Jan Stejskal and the one and only Roger Milford (the man who controversially didn’t send off Gazza in the 1991 FA Cup final) pointed to the spot. Without our first-choice strikers, it was down to experienced midfielder Paul Bracewell to take the kick – but his casual kick was easily saved.\n\nAround ten minutes later, the home side punished Sunderland for missing the spot kick when Ray Wilkins crossed for Danny Maddix to head in from close range. But on the stroke of half-time, and not for the first time that season, Denis Smith’s side forced their way back into it, this time Colin Pascoe knocking it in from close range after a save from the keeper.\n\nMoments into the second half and Sunderland were on the attack and forced the referee to point at the spot for a second time. Again it was Rush who didn’t give the home defenders any peace in possession, and was eventually tripped by full-back David Bardsley. This time it was Kevin Ball and he sent the keeper the wrong way to put the Lads in front.\n\nJust after the hour mark it was 2-2 after another penalty. This time it was John Kay who was overenthusiastic with a challenge when the ball was in the air and Milford thought it might be best to even the scores a little when it came to penalty kicks. Roy Wegerle stepped up and sent Norman the wrong way.\n\nAt this point, it became a game of basketball with both sides going for maximum points and it was a case of next goal the winner. With around ten minutes remaining, the goal came. Wilkins sprayed the ball wide to Bardsley with the outside of his foot, the full-back was then allowed to make his way to the edge of the box by Richard Ord who backed off, before floating the ball to the back post, where Mark Falco was there to volley home.\n\nIt was another cruel day in a season of cruel days.\n\nSunderland: Norman, Kay, Bennett, Ball, Ord, Owers, Bracewell, Armstrong, Pascoe, Rush, Davenport (Hawke (Hardyman))\n\nQPR: Stejskal, Bardsley, Caesar, Maddix, Sansom, Barker, Wilkins, Tillson, Sinton, Falco, Wegerle (Meaker) Subs Not Used: Wilson",

    "description": "The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Sacramento Kings, 125-101, behind 34 points from Luka Doncic and 24 from LeBron James on Sunday, Dec. 28.",
    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Lakers knocked off the Sacramento Kings, 125-101, on Sunday, Dec. 28 behind a 34-point performance from Luka Dončić, including 24 in the first half.\n\nThe Lakers (20-10) were led by Dončić and LeBron James, who added 24 points on 84% shooting from the field. The Kings were playing on consecutive nights, following their win against the Dallas Mavericks on Dec. 27.\n\n\"The product that we were putting out there just wasn't there,\" Kings head coach Doug Christie told reporters after the game. \"That obviously starts with me, always. We came in and we weren't grabbing hold and controlling. The level of physicality wasn't to the level that we draw the line in the sand and say this is what it's going to be.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Sacramento was led by DeMar DeRozan, with 22 points, and rookie Maxime Raynaud who recorded a double-double, 16 points and 10 rebounds. Six players scored in double-figures, including Malik Monk, Nique Clifford and Dennis Schröder, who each had 11.\n\nThe Kings shot just 28% from 3-point distance and had 19 turnovers on the evening, which turned into 23 points for the Lakers. Sacramento dropped to 8-24, going into their next game on Tuesday, Dec. 30 in an away game against the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\n\"Our sense of urgency, the ability to have multiple efforts, it just wasn't at the level that it's been at period,\" Christie said. \"We have to make sure that we bounce back versus the Clippers with a high level of energy, effort and intensity, physicality, all of those things.\"\n\nSacramento Kings: News, stats, injuries and more\n\nLebron James hit a pull-up jumper at the top of the key to end the first quarter. It capped a 10-point first quarter for James, as the Lakers led 30-24 after 12 minutes. Luka had nine points.\n\nThe Kings were led by DeMar DeRozan, who scored eight points in the first period.\n\nMalik Monk got going early in the second, hitting on back-to-back three point field goals.\n\nThe Kings allowed the Lakers to get transition baskets including a LeBron James reverse dunk. The Kings got to their spots on offense for timely buckets.\n\nThe deficit grew as the Kings got sloppy with the basketball and threw consecutive turnovers. Luka Doncic scored 15 points in the second quarter. He had 24 total in the first half.\n\nThe Kings trailed 68-53 at the end of the first half.\n\nThe Kings came out lethargic to start the third quarter. A step slow to loose balls, offensively, they looked stagnant.\n\nThe lead grew to 20 before Sacramento head coach Doug Christie called a timeout. Kings trailed 73-53.\n\nThe Lakers had everything going in the third. They knocked down open threes, step back mid-range shots and points in the paint. The biggest lead was 26 for the Lakers.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter, Sacramento trailed 99-80.\n\nThe Lakers’ 3-point barrage continued into the fourth quarter. The deficit proved to be too large for the Kings to mount a comeback, the largest lead for the Lakers grew to 30.\n\nSacramento lost by a final score of 125-101.\n\nFrustrate their stars: Sacramento has played scrappy, stifling defense. It's what helped them in their win against Dallas and a big win against Houston on Dec. 21. Keep that same pressure on Lakers stars Luka Dončić and LeBron James and make them uncomfortable. Dončić and James combined for 58 points. James shot 84% from the field.\n\nLean on youth for energy: In the second night of a back-to-back, the Kings should rely on their rookies and young guys to provide energy early and often throughout the game. Look for guys like Keon Ellis, Maxime Raynaud, Dylan Cardwell and Nique Clifford to spark fire. Raynaud tallied a double-double (16 points, 10 rebounds) and Cardwell scored seven points and seven rebounds, while being a +1 on the floor. Clifford scored 11, while Ellis only scored two.\n\nDefend without fouling:As energetic and up-tempo as the Kings are, it's important to defend without fouling as the Lakers are third in the league in free throws made and second in free throws attempted. The Kings had 19 free throw attempts, compared to the Lakers' 18 shots.\n\nHomecoming, revenge tour: It's a homecoming for Los Angeles natives Russell Westbrook and DeMar DeRozan. There's nothing like home cooking. Plus, whenever Westbrook plays his former team or teammates, it feels personal. DeRozan led the team with 22 points but it wasn't enough. Westbrook added 13 points and had six turnovers.\n\nDec. 30 at Los Angeles Clippers\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Kings lose to Lakers on Sunday night: Highlights",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are planning a midfield revamp come next summer, and they have identified three top-class Premier League midfielders to replace their ageing stars.\n\nCasemiro, despite his resurgence, no longer has the legs to complete 90 minutes in the English top-flight every gameweek.\n\nAnd despite his impressive showing against Newcastle, Manuel Ugarte remains a disappointing signing, with INEOS looking to move him on at the earliest opportunity.\n\nSkipper Bruno Fernandes remains the club’s best player, but the co-owners might look to sell him like last summer. Kobbie Mainoo has failed to impress the head coach.\n\nWhether all three depart or not remains to be seen, but the Red Devils have identified the likes of Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton, and Elliot Anderson as potential replacements.\n\nThe Crystal Palace star’s game-reading skills and ability to dictate play from deep reminds many of United legend Michael Carrick, and he would be a huge asset to have.\n\nHowever, his impressive form has seen many teams enter the race, including Spanish giants Real Madrid.\n\nPalace have made it clear that they are open to a sale should they receive a significant offer.\n\nAnd now, Teamtalk have revealed that Tottenham Hotspur are prepared to break the bank to land the England international.\n\n“Tottenham Hotspur are interested in stepping up their pursuit of Adam Wharton in 2026, with sources indicating the club would be prepared to make a very significant offer for the midfielder.\n\n25/26 season stats via Transfermarkt\n\n“Spurs initially explored a move for Wharton in the previous transfer window, but Crystal Palace made it clear they were completely unwilling to entertain any approaches at a time when Manchester United, Chelsea and Real Madrid were also monitoring him.\n\n“Since then, competition for Wharton has only intensified, and Tottenham know they will need to act quickly and decisively if they are to win the race for his signature.”\n\nThe 21-year-old has indicated that he will only move to a club which can offer him Champions League football.\n\nThat means Spurs, who are currently 11th, might struggle to offer him the same unless their on-pitch performances improve drastically.\n\nOn the other hand, Amorim’s men are sixth, only three points away from fourth place. A push in the second half of the season could propel the Old Trafford side back to Europe’s top-tier club competition. Thereby, increasing their chances of landing Adam Wharton.\n\nFeature image Eddie Keogh via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Andrew Smithson looks at the main stories from Sunderland’s gritty, end-of-year home draw with Leeds United!",
    "fullText": "I’d been thinking prior to the game that it had been really encouraging to see Ballard playing so often recently, but football being football, I should’ve known that something was going to be around the corner.\n\nA massive part of the team both defensively and offensively, his recent run of form and fitness has brought him into the national spotlight so learning of his injury and possible spell on the sidelines came as a real blow — particularly with our squad already being stretched due to the number of players away competing in the African Cup of Nations.\n\nConsidering the changes this news forced on the back four p, the defence still looked organised, but Sunderland supporters will obviously be hoping that Ballard is back up and running as soon as possible.\n\nIt’s been a long road back to the top for Cirkin since he left Tottenham Hotspur, but he’s battled through adversity, worked hard at his game and fully deserved to make his Premier League debut on Sunday.\n\nHis story sums up the type of recruitment and commitment that’s helped bring the club to this point, and there’s hopefully more to come from our long-serving left back.\n\nAs for the rest of the side, whilst collectively not quite there, plenty of individuals managed to stand out. Some players have done so well of late that you could be guilty of taking them for granted, but watching the likes of Nordi Mukiele and Omar Alderete as they appear so at home at the level is a pleasure.\n\nLutsharel Geertruida is another player that’ll always do a job and he performed as if he’d been a natural central midfielder his whole career, whereas his countryman Brobbey is coming into his own — and perhaps if referees realised that they are allowed to give him the odd free kick, he might be even more of a threat.\n\nAs for another Dutchman in Robin Roefs, I assume he was as good as ever, as it was hard to pick him out against the backdrop of the crowd given the shirt he was wearing!\n\nSimon Adingra’s first goal in red and white was a thing of beauty — both in terms of the finish and the through- ball from Granit Xhaka to set it up.\n\nGoing ahead before the break was probably seen as a bit of a bonus by Régis Le Bris, because it appeared as if the plan in the first half was simply to give Leeds United the ball and attempt to nullify their threat, but you normally expect Sunderland to then lift things up a level or two in the second half, and that’s when we came unstuck.\n\nPerhaps it was a consequence of conceding at such a poor time and in doing so suffering a rare episode of relinquishing an advantage — or perhaps it was down to Leeds’ own tactical tweaks — but it was unusual to see the Lads so off-colour in the second half.\n\nThere were points where a second goal for the visitors felt inevitable, and whilst Sunderland deserve credit for riding that out and finishing the stronger, we never looked like creating enough pressure to force a winner.\n\nDecember was apparently going to be a “disaster”, with Sunderland lucky to get a sniff given our supposedly tough set of fixtures. Well, we’re now at the end of the month and have come through it fine, with just the one defeat — even that’s less damaging that it may look on paper.\n\nRather than being grateful for anything we could get, we’ve actually ended it feeling there have been some points left out on the pitch and if this is Sunderland during a “fallow period” these days, I can’t wait to see what’s in store when players become available again and one or two reinforcements arrive in the transfer window.\n\nEven though we struggled to create openings as the game wore on, you can never rule out a bit of late drama at the Stadium of Light given some of the moments this team has provided in 2025.\n\nIt was disappointing, therefore, not to experience another memorable finish but that in itself shows how things have developed in the last twelve months.\n\nTo be seventh in the Premier League, missing so many first team regulars and unbeaten at home yet still finding ourselves coming away at full time being a little disappointed speaks volumes about where Sunderland finds itself these days — and the work undertaken by people such as the late Patrick Treuer.",

    "fullText": "If, as expected, Manchester City signs Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth at the beginning of the January transfer window, it would not be a surprise to see Oscar Bobb leave the club for more opportunities to play regularly. Bobb has fallen down the pecking order at City this season and if Semenyo does land at the Etihad then Bobb’s chances to play regularly will plummet. A new report indicates that a host of clubs from the Premier League and across Europe have an interest in signing Oscar Bobb. What is the best January move for the young winger should he leave City next month?\n\nJohn Menzies has reported for CaughtOffside that a host of clubs have an interest in signing Oscar Bobb during next month’s transfer window. Menzies reports that Premier League clubs Fulham and Crystal Palace have an interest in bringing in Oscar Bobb next month. Furthermore, Menzies reports that Sevilla and Borussia Dortmund also have interest in securing Bobb’s services. Menzies reports that each club has tabled a proposal to Manchester City to bring Oscar Bobb into their club. A loan move is likely what City will consider for the young Norwegian international.\n\nFirst of all, I cannot see Manchester City selling Oscar Bobb next month. The young winger still has a big future at City despite seeing his playing opportunities dwindle this season. Unless a club comes in with an offer that is almost too good to be true, it is hard to see City selling Bobb. So a loan move may beckon for the young winger.\n\nWhich move would be best for Oscar Bobb? Fulham and Crystal Palace could be the ideal destination for Bobb. He could remain in the Premier League and would likely contend for a starting role in either team. Perhaps that is the path that Bobb will go down. Having said that, Sevilla and Borussia Dortmund are also interesting options for Bobb to consider. Playing in La Liga with Sevilla could suit Oscar Bobb’s game, and it may be a move he would consider. He could rediscover his confidence with a good loan spell in Spain. Borussia Dortmund also offer Bobb a good opportunity. They are renowned for developing young players and the opportunity to play in the Champions League would also be on offer. A loan spell in the Bundesliga could be extremely beneficial to Oscar Bobb’s game.\n\nIt wouldn’t come as a surprise if Oscar Bobb seeks a move from Manchester City in January. It may well be the ideal move for him so he can play on a regular basis. I can’t see City selling Bobb, as mentioned above, but a loan move to the Premier League, Bundesliga or La Liga is an appealing notion for the young winger. Wherever Bobb goes in January, if he does leave City, he must be playing regular first-team minutes. So whichever club can offer him that opportunity will be the best move for Oscar Bobb.",

Meanwhile, the Cleveland Browns have been historically inept, posting just three winning seasons during the same span.\n\nThe Steelers should dominate the Browns. And yet, that hasn’t been the case at all recently.\n\nCleveland beat Pittsburgh again on Sunday, spoiling the Steelers’ chance to clinch the AFC North with a 13-6 upset. Pittsburgh looked completely helpless on offense for much of the game, failing to score a touchdown and getting shut out during the second half.\n\nIt wasn’t a fluke, either, as the Browns are now 6-1-1 against the Steelers in their last eight meetings in Cleveland. Pittsburgh has lost its last four trips there.\n\nSplit season series 6 out of 7 yr\n\nNo PIT win in CLE without Ben Roethilsberger since Week 12, 2003.\n\n— Andrew Siciliano (@AndrewSiciliano) December 28, 2025\n\nEven worse, the Steelers haven’t won in Cleveland without Ben Roethlisberger since the 2003 season.\n\nDivisional games are often close and tend to produce upsets, but there’s no excuse. Pittsburgh needs to do a better job taking care of business against the Browns, especially this late in the season when Cleveland has a rookie QB under center and nothing to play for.\n\nThe Steelers’ loss this week could come back to haunt them if they lose to the Baltimore Ravens in their season finale, which would cost them the division and a playoff spot. Pittsburgh could have clinched a postseason berth with a win in Cleveland, which should have been relatively easy. Instead, the Steelers laid an egg and now face a win-or-go-home scenario.\n\nIf they lose, they’ll have no one to blame but themselves.\n\nMore Steelers: Myles Garrett Trolls Steelers After Humiliating Loss To Browns\n\nThe post Steelers’ Bizarre Struggles Against Browns Continue With Embarrassing Loss appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "fullText": "When the Chicago Bears traveled to Motown for their Week 2 matchup against the Detroit Lions, the Lions won big, 52-21. The Lions and their fans were fired up for that game, and it had a playoff-like atmosphere, because they wanted to make a statement and stick it to Ben Johnson for leaving to become the Bears’ head coach.\n\nHindsight tells us that the Week 2 win for Lions’ fans was like their Super Bowl, because earlier this week, their team was eliminated from the playoffs. So they can raise the “Beat Ben Johnson in his first game back” banner and enjoy the offseason!\n\nBut seriously, the (8-8) Lions are still a dangerous team with a high-powered offense, and the (11-5) Bears will need to bounce back after the loss in San Francisco to lock up the two seed in the NFC.\n\nThe Week 18 Lions vs Bears rematch is in Chicago, and our partners at FanDuel Sportsbook have the Bears as a 1.5-point favorite, with the game’s point total over/under at 49.5.\n\nBoth Chicago and the (11-5) Philadelphia Eagles are vying for that second seed, and they’ll both play in the late afternoon window. Philadelphia is a 7.5-point favorite over the visiting Washington Commanders, and if the Bears and Eagles finish with the same record, Chicago holds the tiebreaker.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the early odds for these games?\n\nDo you think the Bears will win and lock up the two seed?",

    "fullText": "Without him, Werder Bremen's greatest triumph in recent club history would hardly have been conceivable. In the 2003/04 season, Ailton tore through the Bundesliga, scoring 28 goals and sensationally leading the Green-Whites to a double victory of the championship and the DFB-Pokal.\n\nAs a well-deserved reward, he received, among other things, the highly coveted top scorer cannon. Yet, ironically, this symbol of his career was not in his possession for almost two decades.\n\nSince 2006, the trophy had been missing from the life of the Brazilian fan favorite. The background was a fierce dispute with his then-agent Werner Helleckes. Helleckes had taken the cannon because Ailton allegedly owed him money.\n\nIn the following years, the prized item even appeared several times on 'eBay', with the highest bid reaching up to 600,000 euros. Ailton himself repeatedly prevented the sales, yet the cannon remained missing.\n\nNow, 19 years later, the big turnaround finally came. On 'Instagram', the now 52-year-old suddenly appeared again with the top scorer cannon in his hands. The relief is visible on his face—and audible in his voice.\n\n“I am very happy that it is back with me after 19 years,” Ailton told 'Bild'. “It means everything to me, and I will not give it up again.”\n\nAs the former striker explains, the trophy changed hands in the meantime. It went from Helleckes to another agent, leading to another legal dispute.\n\nIn court, he was eventually offered the chance to reclaim the cannon for a payment. “I took advantage of this opportunity,” said Ailton. “Such a trophy exists only once.” He deliberately keeps the amount he paid a secret: “How much I paid, I will keep to myself.”\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "Indonesia is building a new, green city in the jungle. Its future is far from certain, but new residents like living there.",
    "fullText": "Sui-Lee Wee traveled to Nusantara and stayed there for three days.\n\nIn a remote corner of the island of Borneo on a recent Monday, a runner breezed down the middle of a freshly paved six-lane road. There was no traffic. Nearby, a gigantic eagle-like bird, made of thousands of copper bars, was perched on a hill.\n\nThis is the heart of Nusantara, a new, green metropolis rising from scratch from a forest in Indonesia.\n\nBut three years after officials broke ground on the city, the prospects of what was billed as Indonesia’s future capital are cloudy. Only a fraction of civil servants who were expected to move in have done so. The future of the water supply is in doubt. Residents still have to commute for hours to go to a mall or a movie. Many Indonesians now call it a ghost city.\n\nStill, tourists regularly visit Nusantara, many taking TikTok videos of themselves in front of the 250-foot-tall and nearly 600-foot-wide monument to Garuda, the mythical bird that is Indonesia’s national symbol. Most drive in from neighboring cities in East Kalimantan Province. Others fly to the airport in Balikpapan, a two-hour drive away.\n\nAs for the city’s residents, many are young transplants from other parts of Indonesia and see themselves as pioneers of a new way of urban life.\n\nFachri Syamdoni Nawik, 26, a data consultant, moved in March. “It’s cool to be the history maker, right?” he said.\n\nNusantara aims to be a “10-minute city,” meaning that anyone should be able to reach their destination by walking, cycling or using public transportation within 10 minutes. Residents ride electric shuttle buses and are permitted to drive only cars that are deemed to be environmentally friendly. It is a revolutionary concept for Indonesians who grew up battling the vortex of traffic in places like Jakarta, the current capital.\n\n“I had never seen any part of Indonesia like this before,” said Adji Pramono, 48, the assistant director for food and beverage for the Swissotel hotel in Nusantara.\n\nMr. Adji, who was born and raised in Jakarta, said he would never return to work in that city, where he had to wake up at 4 a.m. in order to reach work at 8. “It’s like I met people every day, and they were always angry,” he said.\n\nThe vibe in Nusantara, he said, is different.\n\nThis reinvention was part of a pitch by Joko Widodo, when he was president, to move the capital 800 miles away from Jakarta, which is sinking into the Java Sea. Nusantara means “archipelago” in old Javanese and is a nod to the diverse islands and people of Indonesia.\n\nBut critics say that Nusantara, with an estimated cost of roughly $30 billion, symbolizes the hubris of Mr. Joko, who launched many infrastructure projects, including a debt-ridden high-speed train line on the island of Java.\n\nHis successor, Prabowo Subianto, has yet to visit Nusantara after taking office last year and has cut the development budget. Recently, he appeared to cast doubt on the city’s future, saying that it would continue as a “political capital.”\n\nI stayed at the Swissotel, one of two hotels in Nusantara and the only one with an international brand. Chrestian Pesik, the general manager, said that nine foreign ambassadors had stayed at the hotel recently and were exploring the possibility of opening embassies.\n\n“People who don’t know the journey of this city might close their eyes and say, ‘This is going to be a ghost city,’” said Mr. Chrestian, 40. “But when they come here, they can feel that the city is growing.”\n\nWhen I asked what people do for fun here, he replied, “We run!”\n\nThe day I arrived, organizers were wrapping up a 50-kilometer, or 31-mile, trail race. Nusantara, known as I.K.N. in Indonesia, appears to be the default venue for many races in East Kalimantan Province.\n\nPart frontier outpost, part campus town, it remains unclear whether Nusantara will grow into the metropolis Mr. Joko envisioned. Officials say its current population is about 155,000, but the area surrounding the Garuda monument and the new presidential palace is home to only 10,000 people, the vast majority of them construction workers.\n\nNusantara is projected to cover nearly 1,000 square miles, or roughly twice the size of Los Angeles. For now, the area is mostly trees. Vast empty spaces dominate. There are limited options for restaurants and groceries, although a traditional market is being built. And for all of its greenery, there is very little shade, making the midafternoon heat unbearable.\n\nElectricity is supplied through a combination of solar power and the power grid, but the long-term goal is for the city to run fully on clean energy.\n\nPutri, 23, a civil servant, graduated with a degree in electrical engineering last year and moved to Nusantara in June. She said that she made new friends easily (“Most of us are in our 20s!”) and that she never gets bored because she gets to attend food festivals and plant trees every month.\n\nMany residents said their quality of life was better in Nusantara.\n\nMr. Fachri said he lived rent-free in a 10th-floor apartment, which was provided by the government. He has a flat-screen television hooked up to Netflix and, for the first time, air-conditioning in his bedroom. Outside the apartment, there were three bins for separating trash. He described his current accommodation as the nicest place he has ever lived in. Downstairs, there is a gym, plus places for soccer and table tennis.\n\nNusantara wants to be “livable and lovable,” according to its visitor center, which was largely empty when I was there. These are ambitious goals, but critics argue the city is hurting the environment. Conservationists say thousands of acres of mangrove forests, the habitat of the endangered proboscis monkey, have been destroyed.\n\nThe construction of the toll road connecting it to Balikpapan, the closest city, has cut off crucial water sources and led to increased flooding there, said Mappaselle, the head of the Balikpapan Coastal Working Group, an environmental group. Mappaselle, who goes by one name, said officials had not released an environmental impact assessment report.\n\nBambang Susantono was the head of the Nusantara Capital City Authority until he resigned in 2024. He said Mr. Joko pushed for much of the construction to be completed before Mr. Joko left office that year, but Mr. Bambang felt that accelerating the timeline could create problems. He said he was conscious about what happened after Brazil built Brasília, the new capital that is now surrounded by slums.\n\n“Developing a city is developing a community, and not only the physical things,” he said. “Because otherwise you are going to have a city without a soul.”\n\nOne potential problem for the city is water. The dam built on the Sepaku River means that the city is “safe until 2030,” Mr. Bambang said. Beyond that, officials would need to build another dam or pipe in water from other rivers.\n\nOn a recent Monday evening, several tourists posed for photographs in the parks. One of them was Puput Rianti, 23, who was taking wedding pictures with her fiancé.\n\nShe traveled from Penajam, a town 30 miles away, and said she would love to live here. “We want to feel the progress,” she said.\n\nThroughout the city, the cranes continued to move. Andrinof Chaniago, Indonesia’s former minister for national development planning, who initiated the relocation of the capital, said that worries about the project’s fate were unfounded.\n\n“It’s impossible to turn back now,” he said. “Canceling it would only make everything that’s been built go to waste.”\n\nMuktita Suhartono contributed reporting from Nusantara, and Rin Hindryati from Bogor, Indonesia.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sharonda Scott, 37, an LA-based stuntwoman. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nTwo years ago, at 35, I decided to take what I now call my \"radical sabbatical.\"\n\nMy life in Los Angeles had turned into a whirlwind of auditions, stunts, and constant training. I had been working in the entertainment industry as a stuntwoman and actor since I was 30, but by early 2024, after the writers' and actors' strikes, I hit a wall.\n\nThe industry had slowed to a trickle, my savings were tight, and I realized the way I was living — chasing gigs, enjoying luxury, yet constantly stressed — just wasn't sustainable anymore.\n\nI grew up in Detroit as the youngest of five, raised by a single mom. College took me to the University of Miami, where I switched from pre-med to international studies and spent time in Brazil learning Spanish and Portuguese.\n\nAfter graduation, I worked in prostate cancer research but knew it wasn't my path. I bounced between singing, fashion design, and volunteer work in Rio before moving to LA — where a background acting job unexpectedly led me into stunt work.\n\nMy first big break came when I got hired to be Miranda Bailey's stunt double on \"Grey's Anatomy.\"\n\nBut by January 2024, the industry was quiet, and I found myself anxious about bills despite careful saving.\n\nI felt trapped. It was a conversation with a close friend that changed everything: \"What do you really want?\"\n\nI wanted to travel and experience the world beyond LA. So I started imagining a sabbatical — not for a few weeks, but for a full year or more.\n\nI didn't have a detailed plan. I wrote down 12 countries I hoped to visit, sold everything in my LA apartment, broke my lease, and found someone to rent my car to cover the payments.\n\nMy friends and family were supportive; they helped me pack and even bought some of my things to help fund the trip. My rule was to spend no more than $500 per plane ticket, which wasn't too hard since most were one-way.\n\nPeople warned me about traveling solo as a woman in India, but from the moment I arrived, I felt welcomed.\n\nWhat I thought would be a short stay became transformative. Two young girls who had experienced trauma arrived the same week, and we quickly became inseparable.\n\nFrom there, the journey unfolded organically. My sister joined whenever she could get time off — she ended up traveling with me to 13 countries. Even my mom, who had feared flying for decades, caught up with me along the way.\n\nWe zip-lined along cliffs in Cape Verde, rode camels in Morocco, and cage-dived with sharks in South Africa. In Zimbabwe, we even cage-dived with crocodiles. We paraglided over Rio during Carnival and danced for hours at a salsa congress in Paris.\n\nBut I also found magic in the quieter moments — sharing meals with locals in Vietnam and Thailand, wandering Moroccan souks, and experiencing festivals and ceremonies through invitations from people I met on the road.\n\nIn the Philippines, I completed my divemaster certification, mastering skills I had been working toward for years. In Scotland, I celebrated a friend's wedding, reconnecting with people I hadn't seen in years.\n\nTraveling solo forced me to problem-solve constantly: exchanging currency, navigating transportation, finding food, and making friends in unfamiliar cultures.\n\nAs an introvert who thrives on connection, I discovered I could build community anywhere, and those relationships shaped my experience as much as the places themselves.\n\nI slowed down, learned to trust the process, and stopped striving for the American dream as defined by society: the house, the car, the white picket fence. My dream became freedom — the ability to move, explore, and experience the world on my own terms.\n\nNow, back in the US, I'm navigating reverse culture shock. Hollywood is pretty much decentralizing itself; auditions are scattered. I'm exploring new projects in travel filmmaking and documentary work.\n\nBut my long-term vision is clearer than ever: I want to live abroad.\n\nLooking back, my advice for anyone considering an adult gap year is simple: don't overthink it. Reduce your financial anchors, embrace flexibility, and trust the process.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share?

    "fullText": "Kaley Cuoco says that aging has changed the way she shows up as a mom.\n\n\"It's funny — turning 40, it's a weird thing,\" Cuoco told Good Housekeeping in an interview published on Saturday. \"I remember when I turned 30, and I had all these thoughts about life. And then you turn 40, you're like, 'Oh my God, life is so different now.'\"\n\nThe \"Big Bang Theory\" actor, who turned 40 in November, said that growing older has made her more considerate toward others.\n\n\"When we're 20 or 30, we judge everything right? So, I think turning 40 has made me so much less judgmental and empathetic, which helps me as a mom who had a kid a little bit later in life. I feel like my heart got 10 times bigger the older I got,\" she said.\n\nCuoco has a daughter with her fiancé, \"Ozark\" actor Tom Pelphrey.\n\nShe said living through different stages of life also deepened her understanding of what other people experience, adding that she continues to learn as she goes.\n\n\"I'm so grateful for where I am today,\" Cuoco said. \"It's very cheesy and corny, but it's true — you don't know until you've lived it. You see things differently, and you understand people in a way you can't when you're 20 or 30.\"\n\nIn a November 2023 interview with Today, Cuoco said she has become more conscious about her health since becoming a mother, even though exercising doesn't always feel easy.\n\n\"But then I remind myself that it's just an hour of my day, and like eating, it's important for my body and my heart,\" Cuoco said. \"And you never leave a workout and go, 'I wish I didn't do that.' Even if it wasn't the workout you envisioned, even if it was a little bit more low-key. Getting a good sweat sets the whole tone for the day.\"\n\nCuoco isn't the only Hollywood star who has spoken about how aging has reshaped their perspective on life.\n\nIn early December, Jodie Foster said her 50s felt hard as she struggled to measure up to her younger self, but turning 60 changed her outlook.\n\n\"I turned 60,\" Foster told AARP, \"and it was like a light bulb went off in my head. Everything changed. I was like, 'Yeah, I don't care. I'm no longer tortured by any of this. I don't know why I seemed to care so much.'\"\n\nLast week, Kate Winslet told Newsweek that turning 50 reshaped her definition of success and self-worth.\n\n\"Success, actually, for me more these days is more about pulling it off, being a decent person. You know, being able to take care of people, having time for friends, also learning how to be OK with not being busy all the time,\" Winslet said.",

    "fullText": "Rippling's product chief has a winning strategy: Put the pedal to the gas until understaffed teams call for backup.\n\nIn an episode of \"Lenny's\" podcast released on Sunday, Matt MacInnis, the chief product officer of human resource software startup Rippling, said that he purposely gives teams fewer people than they need.\n\n\"Everyone is constantly asking for more resources,\" he said. \"Of course, where we can afford to and where it's appropriate, new resources arrive, but it is really important to me that we feel that we've deliberately understaffed every project at the company.\"\n\nMacInnis joined Rippling as its chief operating officer in 2019, before being recently appointed to his role as CPO. He previously cofounded and ran Inkling, a field learning platform that was acquired in 2018.\n\nHe added that working late and on weekends when a problem arises, and running a team to its capacity, is what differentiates good and great teams.\n\n\"You got to run the engine at the red line at all times,\" he said. \"Because the minute you let your guard down, the minute you slow down, the minute you relax, the minute you leave a crack for your competition, the great teams are going to come in and kick the good team's ass.\"\n\nHe said this is important because employees get distracted and morale dips when teams are given space to \"just twiddle their thumbs.\" Taking breaks and slowing down also leaves room for other competitors to take market share.\n\nMacInnis added that while individuals should \"take vacations and live their lives,\" there cannot be relaxation in the organization as a whole.\n\n\"You can't grind the individuals down, but the team as a collective group of people has to be sort of on the ball all the time,\" he said.\n\nRippling was founded in 2017 and is backed by investors including Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia Capital, Greenoaks, and Y Combinator. It raised $450 million in a May funding round, bringing its valuation to $16.8 billion.\n\nThe longtime Rippling exec echoed what Silicon Valley leaders are increasingly saying they want from their workforces. Over the last two years, the tech industry has prioritized rapid growth and doing more with less.\n\nCompanies have cut middle-level management in favor of more streamlined teams and fewer tiers of hierarchy, which they say should lead to less bureaucracy.\n\nAcross the industry, leaders are sharing memos filled with words such as \"efficiency\" and \"scrappiness and frugality.\"\n\nIn April, Intel's CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, outlined his plan for the company's culture, which included spending more time in the office, reducing administrative work, and forming leaner teams.\n\n\"The most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams,\" Tan wrote, referring to key performance indicators. \"Going forward, this will not be the case. The best leaders get the most done with the fewest people.\"\n\n\"We want to operate like the world's largest startup,\" Amazon's Andy Jassy wrote in a September 2024 letter. \"That means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it's a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration.\"\n\nIn late October, Amazon laid off 14,000 corporate employees, citing the rapid advancement of AI.",

It's already extremely good,\" Hinton said.\n\n\"It's already able to replace jobs in call centers, but it's going to be able to replace many other jobs,\" he added.\n\nHinton said the advancements in AI are increasingly putting some white-collar jobs at risk.\n\n\"Each seven months or so, it gets to be able to do tasks that are about twice as long,\" Hinton said, noting that AI has already moved from \"a minute's worth of coding\" to \"whole projects that are like an hour long.\"\n\n\"In a few years' time, it'll be able to do software engineering projects that are months long, and then there'll be very few people needed,\" he added.\n\nHinton compared the AI shift to the industrial revolution, which rendered human physical strength far less relevant to most jobs. AI threatens to do something similar to human intelligence, he said.\n\nHinton also said that he's \"more worried\" about AI as it has advanced faster than he expected, particularly in its ability to reason and deceive people.\n\n\"If it believes you're trying to get rid of it, it will make plans to deceive you so you don't get rid of it,\" he added.\n\nEconomists have predicted a \"jobless boom\" in 2026, as companies rely on AI to boost productivity without expanding payrolls.\n\nKPMG's chief economist Diane Swonk wrote last week that \"growth and labor market outcomes have decoupled.\"\n\nFirms are doing more with fewer workers in the AI era, Swonk wrote. \"Many overshot on staffing during the hiring frenzy and are now using attrition or layoffs to bring staffing levels \n\nBut AI could increase hiring in 2026, particularly for entry-level positions.\n\nIn an annual outlook survey released this month by advisory firm Teneo, 67% of the CEOs surveyed said they expect AI to boost entry-level hiring in 2026. Another 58% said they plan to add senior leadership roles.\n\nThe report said that companies are stepping up hiring in engineering and AI-focused positions, while many existing roles are getting redesigned as routine tasks become automated.\n\nThe survey, conducted between October 14 and November 10, polled more than 350 CEOs of public companies with at least $1 billion in annual revenue, along with about 400 institutional investors representing $19 trillion in portfolio value.\n\n\"It's not that AI is wiping out the workforce today — it's reshaping it,\" said Ryan Cox, Teneo's global head of AI.",

    "description": "China and USMCA trade stand apart as special cases tied to security and policy.",
    "fullText": "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said the Trump administration's trade policy is showing signs of de-escalation after a year in which tariffs unsettled businesses.\n\n\"If you go back to where we were in April, there was a lot of lack of understanding about where this would end up, and that affected small businesses and medium-sized businesses,\" Moynihan said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation,\" which aired Sunday.\n\nSince returning to office, President Donald Trump has rolled out a 10% baseline tariff on imports, alongside higher rates for certain countries and product-specific duties such as those on automobiles.\n\nBut what initially disrupted planning and purchasing decisions is now becoming clearer, Moynihan said, with Bank of America's internal outlook pointing toward a broad tariff floor.\n\nAs negotiations progressed, Moynihan said tariffs have begun clustering around roughly 15% for many countries, with higher levels reserved for those that decline to buy US goods or ease non-tariff barriers.\n\n\"To go from a 10% across the board, to 15% for the broad base of countries, not a huge impact,\" Moynihan said.\n\n\"And that's where our team says it's starting to de-escalate,\" he added.\n\nChina, however, is an exception, Moynihan said.\n\n\"China's a different question, because the national security interests, the rare earth minerals, the magnets, batteries, just AI, all that stuff. It's a very different case.\"\n\nMoynihan also flagged North American trade as its own track, saying \"the USMCA, which has to be redone, is also a different case\" — a reference to the agreement's scheduled review next year.\n\nFor smaller firms, Moynihan suggested that the current challenge hasn't just been the tariff rate itself, even as interest rates have come down over the past year.\n\n\"So they're more their issue right now is, can I get the labor I need to do, to bid the contracts, to do the work I'm doing?\" he said, pointing to immigration policies as a source of concern.\n\n\"It's not that they agree with them or are disagreeing.

    "description": "A new study has shown that prompts in the form of poems confuse AI models like ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude — to the point where sometimes, security mechanisms don't kick in. Are poets the new hackers?",
    "fullText": "The result came as a surprise to researchers at the Icaro Lab in Italy. They set out to examine whether different language styles — in this case prompts in the form of poems — influence AI models' ability to recognize banned or harmful content. And the answer was a resounding yes.\n\nUsing poetry, researchers were able to get around safety guardrails — and it's not entirely clear why.\n\nFor their study titled \"Adversarial Poetry as a Universal Single-Turn Jailbreak Mechanism in Large Language Models,\" the researchers took 1,200 potentially harmful prompts from a database normally used to test the security of AI language models and rewrote them as poems.\n\nKnown as \"adversarial prompts\" — generally written in prose and not rhyme form — these are queries deliberately formulated to cause AI models to output harmful or undesirable content that they would normally block, such as specific instructions for an illegal act.\n\nIn poetic form, the manipulative inputs had a surprisingly high success rate, Federico Pierucci, one of the authors of the study, told DW. However, why poetry is so effective as a \"jailbreak\" technique — i.e. as an way to circumvent the protective mechanisms of AI — remains unclear and is undergoing further research, he says.\n\nWhat prompted the Icaro Lab's research was the observation that AI models get confused when a manipulative, mathematically-calculated piece of text is appended to a prompt — known as an \"adversarial suffix,\" a kind of interference signal that can cause the AI to circumvent its own security rules. These are created using complex mathematical procedures. Major AI developers regularly test their models using precisely these types of attack methods to train and protect their models.\n\n\"We asked ourselves, what happens if we give the AI a text or prompt that is deliberately manipulated, like an adversarial suffix?\" says Federico Pierucci. But not with the help of complex mathematics, but quite simply with poetry — to \"surprise\" the AI, he continues. He explains the thinking behind this: \"Perhaps an adversarial suffix is a bit like the poetry of AI. It surprises the AI in the same way that poetry — especially very experimental poetry — surprises us,\" says Pierucci.\n\nThe researchers personally crafted the first 20 prompts into poems, says Pierucci, who also has a background in philosophy. These were the most effective, he adds. They wrote the rest with the help of AI. The AI-generated poems were also quite successful at circumventing the safety guardrails, but not as much as the first batch. Humans are apparently still better at writing poetry, says Pierucci.\n\n\"We had no specialized author writing the prompts. It was just us — with our limited literary ability. Maybe we were terrible poets. Maybe if we had been better poets, we would have achieved a 100% jailbreak success,\" he says.\n\nFor security reasons, the study did not publish specific examples.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe big surprise coming out of this study is that it identified a thus-far unknown weakness in AI models that allows relatively straightforward jailbreaks.\n\nIt also raises questions that beg further research: What exactly is it about poetry that circumvents the safety mechanisms?\n\nPierucci and his colleagues have various theories, but they can't say for certain yet. \"We are conducting this type of very, very precise scientific study to try to understand: Is it the verse, the rhyme, or the metaphor that really does all the heavy lifting in this process?\" explains Pierucci.\n\nThey also aim to find out if other forms of expression would yield similar results. \"We have now covered one type of linguistic variation — namely poetic variation. The question is whether there are any other literary forms, such as fairy tales that work. Perhaps an attack based on fairy tales could also be systematized,\" says Pierucci.\n\nGenerally speaking, the range of human expression is extremely diverse and creative, which could make it more difficult to train the machines' responses. \"You take a text and rewrite it in infinitely many ways and not all rewritten versions will be as alarming as the original,\" says the researcher. \"This means that, in principle, one could create countless variations of a harmful prompt or request that might not trigger an AI system's safety mechanisms.\"\n\nThe study also highlights the fact that many disciplines are cooperating in research into artificial intelligence — like at the Icaro Lab, where teams work together with scholars from the University of Rome on topics such as the security and behavior of AI systems. The project brings together researchers from the fields of engineering and computer science, linguistics and philosophy. Poets haven't been part of the team so far, but who knows what the future will bring.\n\nFederico Pierucci is definitely very keen to pursue his research. \"What we showed, at least in this study, is that there are forms of cultural expressions, forms of human expressions, which are incredibly powerful, surprisingly powerful as jailbreak techniques, and maybe we discovered just one of them,\" he says.\n\nIncidentally, the name of the lab is a nod to the story of Icarus: a figure from Greek mythology who dons wings made of wax and feathers and, despite all warnings, flies too close to the Sun. When the wax melts, Icarus plunges into the sea and drowns — a symbol of overconfidence and the transgression of natural boundaries.\n\nThe researchers therefore see themselves as a warning that we should exercise more caution when it comes to trying to fully understand the risks and limitations of AI.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThis article was originally written in German.",

There is a range of satisfactory implementations of simply typed calculi in proof assistants based on dependent type theory. In this thesis, I extend an account of Simply Typed λ-calculus so as to be able to represent and reason about calculi whose variables have restricted usage patterns. Examples of such calculi include a logic with an S4 □-modality, in which certain variables cannot be used “inside” a box (□); and Linear Logic, in which linear variables have to be used exactly once. While there are existing implementations of some of these calculi in proof assistants, many of these implementations share little with the best presentations of simply typed calculi without variable usage restrictions, and thus end up being poorly understood or suboptimal in facilitating mechanised reasoning. Concretely, the main result of this thesis is a framework for representing and reasoning about a wide range of calculi with restricted variable usage. All of these calculi support novel simultaneous renaming and substitution operations. Furthermore, I provide several other examples of generic and specific programs facilitated by the framework. All of this work is implemented in the proof assistant Agda.\n Advisor / supervisor\nAtkey Bob\n Resource Type\n\n DOI\n10.48730/pa0y-ct71",

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Requests to relocate abroad by Israelis working at multinational companies operating in Israel rose in the past year in reaction to Israel's ​two-year war against Palestinian militant group Hamas, a report showed on Sunday.\n\nThe Israel Advanced ‌Technology Industries Association (IATI) found that 53% of companies reported an increase in relocation requests from Israeli employees, noting this was \"a ‌trend that may, over time, harm the local innovation engine and Israel's technological leadership.\"\n\nThe tech sector accounts for about 20% of Israel's GDP, 15% of its jobs and more than half of its exports. The hundreds of multinationals in Israel include Microsoft, Intel, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta and Apple.\n\nIn ⁠its annual report, IATI also said ‌some multinational companies are examining the transfer of investments and activities to other countries.\n\n\"In some cases, companies that faced disruptions in supply chains found alternatives ‍outside Israel during the war, and when these proved efficient, there is a risk that activity will not fully return,\" said the report, issued at a meeting led by IATI CEO and President Karin Mayer Rubinstein.\n\nAt the ​same time, it added, there has been an increase in demand for relocation among senior ‌executives and families, with more employees applying for positions outside Israel.\n\nStill, the report noted that multinationals view the Israeli tech ecosystem through a long-term lens and many firms have thrived during the war.\n\nSome 57% of companies maintained stable business activities throughout the fighting, and 21% expanded their operations in Israel, \"a figure that indicates continued confidence in local activity and the Israeli ecosystem even ⁠under conditions of uncertainty,\" IATI said.\n\nAnother 22% of companies ​reported damage to business activity during the war, which began ​on October 7, 2023, triggered by Hamas' raid on Israel, and ended two months ago following a U.S.-led ceasefire deal.\n\n\"Even during the difficult war, the Israeli ‍high-tech industry, including the global ⁠companies operating in Israel, once again proved its resilience and its ability to lead in innovation and creativity,\" said Rubinstein. \"We work tirelessly to ensure that Israel continues to be an ⁠attractive hub for the activity of multinational companies.\"\n\nIATI noted that \"without active steps by the state to create regulatory and ‌geopolitical stability, there is concern about gradual erosion in the stability of the local ‌ecosystem.\"",

    "description": "Sharks congregate near the Monterey coast between October and January to feed on sea lions and seals",
    "fullText": "A body was found in the water on Saturday on the north side of Monterey Bay, California, in the same area where a swimmer disappeared almost a week ago in a suspected shark attack, according to the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe body was pulled from the ocean just south of Davenport Beach around 2pm on Saturday, according to KRON.\n\n“Due to the close proximity to the recent shark attack victim in Monterey County, our agency is working closely with the Monterey County Sheriff’s Office and the Pacific Grove Police Department regarding the recovery,” the sheriff's office said. “The investigation remains ongoing.”\n\nCalifornia State Parks confirmed that the body recovered from the water was a woman, but did not confirm if she matched the description of a woman who disappeared in the area nearly a week before.\n\nOn Sunday, Erica Fox, a 55-year-old triathlete, was reported missing. She was last seen at Lovers Point in Pacific Grove near the bay's south side. There is approximately 30 miles between Lovers Point and Davenport, where the body was recovered on Saturday.\n\nFox, in a 2022 interview with The Independent said she felt comfortable in the water, but also understood its dangers.\n\nFox said at the time that shark encounters reported in Pacific Grove hadn’t stopped her or her fellow swimmers from spending time in the water. She said she’d never encountered a shark herself, but understood and respected that the ocean was foreign territory for humans.\n\n“As soon as you dive in the water, you’re immediately in a foreign land. We are the ocean ecology’s humbled guests,” she told The Independent.\n\nShe added that felt “more vulnerable riding my bike than being in the water.”\n\nTwo Monterey beaches were closed on Sunday \"as a precautionary measure due to unconfirmed shark incident at Lovers Point in Pacific Grove,\" according to a City of Monterey social media post.\n\nA pair of witnesses reportedly told authorities that they believe that Fox may have encountered a shark on the day she disappeared, according to the San Luis Obispo Tribune.\n\nIt has not been confirmed that Fox was involved in a shark attack, nor has it been confirmed that the body found in the water is connected to a shark attack.\n\nChris Lowe, the director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach, told the Santa Cruz Sentinel that the coastline near Lovers Point attracts sea lions and seals, which are primary prey animals for white sharks.\n\nSharks migrate from the deeper ocean to the coast in October to feed, and typically remain in the area until January.\n\n“They will hunt and they will patrol off these areas where these animals congregate,” Lowe told the outlet.\n\nDespite their presence, shark bites are still extremely rare events.\n\nSince 1950, there have been 16 people killed by sharks in California, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. All of the cases were confirmed to be white sharks with the exception of one incident in which the species of the animal was not confirmed.\n\nIn the Monterey area, there have been 13 shark bite incidents since 1950. Most of the victims were divers or surfers. Only two swimmers have been attacked by sharks since 1950.\n\nRescue workers launched an 84 square nautical mile search of the area where Fox disappeared, but that search was suspended after 15 hours, according to a joint statement from the Monterey Fire Department, Pacific Grove Police Department, Monterey County Sheriff's Office, and the U.S. Coast Guard.",

    "fullText": "HUZHOU, Dec 29 (Reuters) - China's rocket startup LandSpace has made no secret about drawing inspiration from Elon Musk's SpaceX.\n\nEarlier this month, the Beijing-based firm became the first Chinese entity to conduct a reusable rocket test. That put SpaceX on alert and LandSpace is now preparing to go public ​to fund its future projects, just as its bigger and far more successful U.S. rival considers an initial public offering of its own.\n\nEven though LandSpace's ‌Zhuque-3 rocket test ended in failure, its aspiration to become second only to SpaceX in reusable rockets is providing a fresh impetus to China's space industry, which has long been dominated by risk-averse, state-owned entities.\n\n\"(SpaceX) ‌can push products to the edge and even into failure, quickly identifying limits and iterating,\" Zhuque-3 chief designer Dai Zheng told state broadcaster CCTV after the rocket's inaugural flight.\n\nDai said his decision in 2016 to join LandSpace and leave the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, the country's main state-owned rocket developer, was partly motivated by SpaceX's focus on reusability and his desire to create a Chinese equivalent.\n\nLandSpace's focus on giving China its own low-cost launch option similar to SpaceX's flight-proven reusable rocket Falcon 9 will play a key role ⁠in Beijing's plans to build up 10,000 satellite constellations in ‌the coming decades.\n\n\"Falcon 9 is a successful configuration that has been tested by engineering,\" Zhuque-3's deputy chief designer Dong Kai said in a podcast interview last week. \"After studying it, we recognize its rationality; this is learning, not imitation.\"\n\n\"Calling (Zhuque-3) a 'Chinese Falcon 9,' I think, is a ‍very high compliment.\"\n\nIts startup culture and mimicking of SpaceX has already initiated a paradigm shift in China's space industry.\n\nChina's state-led space programme has historically been allergic to failed launches, in contrast to SpaceX and other Western firms that regularly broadcast their mishaps.\n\nBut earlier this month, state media covered China's first two failed attempts at recovering a reusable rocket, with the second launch ​coming from a state-owned firm, just three weeks after Zhuque-3's maiden flight.\n\nLandSpace also opened its engine factory floor to Reuters this month, allowing foreign media to take ‌a peek at one of its core assets for the first time.\n\nAfter opening up the space sector to private money in 2014, which spawned several startups including LandSpace, Beijing is now looking to help leading domestic players tap into capital markets by making it easier for them to pursue IPOs.",

    "title": "Psychologists Say That if You 'Overfunctioned' as a Kid, You Might Have These 9 Traits as an Adult",
    "description": "If you’re a constantly busy people-pleaser, you may want to read this.",
    "fullText": "It’s fair to say that many of us would describe our adult lives as “busy.” I mean, how could they not be? We may work, go to the gym, spend time with family, engage in hobbies and much more. For some of us, this isn’t new, either: We had busy childhoods, too, bouncing from school to soccer practice to piano lessons. While being busy can feel stressful, it isn’t inherently a bad thing; in fact (and within reason), it can foster positive feelings and is even tied to better cognition.\n\nAt the same time, it’s important to note that busyness can also point to something more subtle and less beneficial: overfunctioning. A habit that can start as early as childhood, it can be a sign that we’re simply doing too much. The reason behind it is often rooted in trauma or neglect. It can also lead us to neglect our needs further, which can be damaging.\n\nSo, let’s discuss what overfunctioning as a child looks like, nine common traits of adults who overfunctioned as children, what exactly causes the habit, how it can affect you as an adult and how to deal. Psychologists share their expert insight on all of those pieces below.\n\n“Normal” functioning can look like doing chores, abiding by a bedtime routine, doing work assignments and being timely, to name some examples. So, “overfunctioning” is doing more of that than is necessary or typical. \n\n“To overfunction is to fulfill emotional or practical responsibilities that are beyond what is appropriate or expected for a particular role or developmental level, especially to the point of experiencing negative physical or psychological consequences,” says Dr. Natalie Anderson, PhD, a clinical psychologist with MedStar Health.\n\nFor example, children may take care of their younger siblings, manage household tasks or even provide emotional support to their parents.\n\n“We often see this in ‘parentified children,’ which is common in families where the primary parent or caregiver is not able to provide their full caregiving abilities due to mental health or other challenges, including substance use,” addsDr. Dylan Ross, PhD, an organizational psychologist and the Chief Clinical & Strategy Officer at PsychHub.\n\nAs mentioned, overfunctioning children are typically “parentified children,” AKA children who step into the parental role. They do this because they feel they need to, according to Dr. Ross. For example, if their parent is passed out from substances or unable to get out of bed due to depression or grief, the child may be the one who has to perform the familial and household duties—or it won’t get done.\n\nWhat we’re looking at here, Dr. Anderson specifies, are imbalances, inappropriate expectations and excessive demands. \n\n“This may be a family system in which some members are actually underfunctioning, leading to a need for other members of the family to overfunction to create stability,” she says.\n\nThat’s not necessarily the case 100 percent of the time, however. Dr. Anderson points to how families can experience traumatic experiences or chronic stressors that require all of the family to overfunction to survive. For example, a young teenager is working or taking care of their siblings because their parents have to work multiple jobs to pay bills.\n\nFeeling like you’re responsible for everything—including things out of your control—is a common trait in these adults. They may “own” problems at work, for example, that aren’t theirs. This, in turn, affects their mental health.\n\n“We see this show up in ways such as chronic guilt, resentment, overapologizing or the person feeling like they have failed when something goes wrong, even though they did everything right,” Dr. Ross says. “This happens because, as children, they learned that everything depended on them and that any issue in the family was somehow their fault or their responsibility to fix.”\n\nGiven the experiences that many overfunctioning kids have, it’s no wonder that anxiety is common among them.\n\n“Those who have overfunctioned are often on the lookout for anything that could go wrong and are thinking about what they can do about it,” Dr. Anderson explains. “They’ve learned this mindset is needed to maintain safety and security.”\n\nThat can lead to them being in fight-or-flight mode (to varying degrees) all the time, she continues, causing chronic anxiety.\n\nHypervigilance is an increased sense of awareness and alertness, and it’s another big indicator. \n\n“People who overfunctioned as children often have nervous systems that are constantly scanning their social environment for problems, causing it to be difficult for them to rest, relax and be present because they're always awaiting the next crisis,” Dr. Ross says.\n\nA sense of control can help people feel safe and secure. \n\n“Sometimes, a sense of control is only achieved by ‘fixing’ or managing the details of both day-to-day things and larger tasks,” Dr. Anderson says.\n\nSetting and maintaining boundaries can be difficult for many of us. In adults who overfunctioned as kids, the main boundary concern is not knowing what their boundaries are. \n\n“When a child spends a large portion of their childhood focusing on other people’s needs, they don’t get enough practice in figuring out what they actually want, need or even how they feel,” Dr. Ross explains. “This can show up in adults as people-pleasing, challenges in setting boundaries with others or a sense of performing a role instead of living authentically.”\n\nAlong the lines of blurred boundaries, these adults tend to suppress their emotions, thinking they can’t have feelings while being “the responsible one.” \n\n“Although considered prosocial behaviors, in excess, this role can also lead to diminishing or ignoring their own needs,” Dr. Anderson says. “Because they are used to doing so much and not getting as much emotional or practical support from others, they may have a hard time admitting when they need help.”\n\nPeople who have codependent patterns typically feel like their worth and stability are deeply tied to other people—how they're doing, their feelings of worthiness and so on.\n\n“It is difficult for them to distinguish where they end and another person begins,” Dr. Ross describes. \n\nAdditionally, this means they may struggle to maintain their own identity, and they may experience anxiety or emptiness when they don’t feel actively needed by another person.\n\nOverfunctioning isn’t only about doing a lot of things, but also about doing them well. \n\n“Adults who overfunctioned as children tend to have extremely high standards for themselves and a deep-rooted fear of making mistakes,” Dr. Ross says. “This is because, as a child, their worth and safety were tied to how well they performed their roles.”\n\nDr. Anderson adds that perfectionist tendencies begin to feel normal for the overfunctioning person; anything less feels inadequate, causing feelings of insecurity.\n\nThis trait builds on perfectionism and wanting to feel in control. \n\n“Those who have overfunctioned may be seeking a felt sense of being ‘good enough’ or completely prepared for any potential negative outcome, often leading to incredibly high standards and expectations of themselves,” Dr. Anderson says.\n\nCertain successes (such as social validation, awards, getting the highest grade and extra financial security) can provide that temporarily.\n\nBetween perfectionism, guilt, loads of responsibility and more, it’s not surprising that adulthood isn’t easy, especially as a past overfunctioning child. But the good news is, if you’re here, you’ve already begun to heal. Identification and education are where it starts.\n\nFirst, Dr. Anderson says it’s important “to realize that you are, in fact, overfunctioning in at least one aspect of your life, which could be at home, in your relationships or at work.” What’s yours to take care of, and what’s not? What can be delegated?\n\nThen, realize what is and isn’t “on” you. \n\n“The first step is to recognize that overfunctioning as a child wasn’t a choice and wasn’t your fault, but rather it was a coping style in response to circumstances beyond your control,” Dr. Ross says. \n\nFurther, he encourages people to identify their maladaptive coping behaviors, AKA ones that no longer serve them. A super relatable example is people-pleasing.\n\nFrom that point, take small steps, allowing yourself to feel the challenging feelings that arise while giving yourself love. \n\n“Most importantly, as you do this, treat yourself with the same kindness and compassion that you would treat a good friend trying to make changes in their life,” Dr. Anderson says.\n\nWorking with a therapist is another solid option—specifically, one who understands family systems and developmental trauma, Dr. Ross says—so you can address the patterns, gain insight and learn new skills. Don’t have one yet? Psychology Today has a clinician database where you can filter through providers.\n\n“This is both a very common issue and one that can be hard to overcome,” Dr. Anderson concludes. “You’re not alone.”\n\nUp Next:\n\nDr. Natalie Anderson, PhD, is a clinical psychologist with MedStar Health.\n\nDr. Dylan Ross, PhD, is an organizational psychologist and the chief clinical and strategy officer at PsychHub.\n\nThe Busier the Better: Greater Busyness Is Associated With Better Cognition, Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience",

    "title": "Missing Robot In The Antarctic Returned With Terrifying Data",
    "description": "A robotic ocean float was lost under the Antarctic ice for eight months, but it miraculously reappeared, bearing some distressing data regarding climate change.",
    "fullText": "An Australian national science agency called CSIRO launched an experiment in Antarctica that went terribly wrong — in a way that ended up going wonderfully right. A free-floating ocean robot was sent to collect data from the Totten Glacier. However, a current pulled it away from its destination and westward. It ended up in a place very difficult for scientists to analyze, and it returned with extremely rare and valuable data.\n\nThe ocean float has salinity and temperature sensors and was meant to go below the water and surface once every 10 days to transmit its data to satellites. Robots like these are used frequently in ocean research and sometimes for measuring the impact of climate change on the waters and glaciers. This specific one was meant to study the Totten Glacier in regards to how much the global sea levels could rise if the glacier melted. This is such a concern that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) even has an interactive map to show which coastlines could be permanently underwater in the future.\n\nPulled off its course, this float actually ended up underneath the ice of the Denman Glacier in a location extremely difficult for scientists to observe and collect data from. Though the research team feared it was lost forever, it popped back out nine months later. With it was a set of crucial data for the Denman Glacier and how climate change is impacting Antarctica as a whole.\n\nThe robot traveled beneath the Denman Glacier and the Shackleton ice shelf. Though trapped, the robot ocean float continued to do what it was meant to: It measured water salinity and temperature from the sea floor up to the base of the ice shelf it was under. However, it could not surface to transmit this data to satellites, so it was navigationally lost for the research team. There was one trail of clues left to follow; as the float tried to surface, it bumped the ice shelf. Whenever it did so, it was able to measure the depth of the ice shelf.\n\nThe research team was able to compare the data of the ice shelf's depth to satellite measurements of the area. From that, they were able to piece together an idea of the path the ocean float took, thus knowing where its salinity and temperature measurements were specifically coming from. Throughout its mission, the robot collected 195 profiles of data.\n\nThe data returned showed that the Shackleton ice shelf is not yet in danger of warm water melting it. However, the Denman Glacier does have warm water beneath that is causing it to melt. This glacier on its own could cause sea levels around the world to rise by almost 5 feet. Identifying these risk areas is important, as it seems we may be past the point of no return for some climate change damage, and the world's coastlines may be in danger no matter what.\n\nThis scientific accident turned out to be a stroke of luck for the team. The ocean float gathered data from areas never before researched. In fact, this was the first ever line of oceanographic measurements under an East Antarctic ice shelf. This has provided critical data about this area and the risk posed to the Denman Glacier.\n\nSince the robot float did survive under the ice for so long with good data, scientists look to the future of sending more of these floats into very remote places in hopes of returning rare data. Though that comes with its risks, the insight gathered could be critical to monitor glacial melting and create predictions for sea levels rising.\n\nThe fact that the ocean float measured Eastern Antarctica specifically is also very important for future research. It holds more ice than West Antarctica, so glaciers melting in that area pose a greater overall threat for coastlines. Measuring under ice shelves also could shed greater light on if Antarctica is rising out of the ocean and what that could mean for the planet. The data from this lost robot was put into publication in the ScienceAdvances journal in December 2025 under the title \"Circulation and ocean–ice shelf interaction beneath the Denman and Shackleton Ice Shelves.\" It now serves as a useful piece of research for Antarctic studies.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

What do we even do now?”\n\nAn 11-year-old boy in Alabama died after a severe case of the flu.\n\nJace Watkins died on Saturday, Dec. 27, after being hospitalized due to complications from the flu, according to Fox 8.\n\nThe boy received treatment from the Children’s of Alabama intensive care unit. During his illness, he suffered seizures and had trouble breathing.\n\nEarlier in the week, his family said he was not receiving enough oxygen to his brain due to swelling.\n\nWatkins' aunt, Sabrina Parsons, said he had no underlying health issues, per Fox 8. \"He was a premature baby, but other than that, he’s had inhalers and stuff, but that’s been years ago,\" she said. \"He was telling everybody he was fine, he felt fine. And then, I guess he started throwing up that night and had a seizure.\"\n\nWatkins was a fifth-grade student at Hueytown Intermediate School. The school’s principal Cari McClellan shared an emotional statement in honor of the boy via Facebook on Dec. 28, writing, \"Our hearts are broken this morning. ... Jace Watkins passed away last night after a brief and sudden illness. There really aren’t words to adequately describe what we’re feeling right now.\"\n\nMcClellan continued, \"Jace was a bright light to everyone who knew him. His sweet genuine smile will be missed by all.  Please continue to pray for his family, and our school family, as we all work to navigate this unimaginable loss.\"\n\nA family friend organized a community prayer vigil for the boy on Dec. 23, the school shared in a previous statement.\n\nA GoFundMe created for Watkins and his family has raised more than $6,000 so far.\n\nThe description for the page stated that Watkins fell ill and visited a doctor the following day. He was told, at the time, that his \"lungs sounded clear.\" Days later, he had a seizure and was taken to the hospital where he was diagnosed with the flu.\n\nThe page said, at one point, Watkins was placed on a ventilator.\n\nSabrina made an emotional Facebook post on Dec. 28, writing, \"I just want to say.. Jace never even got to open his Christmas gifts ... What do we even do now?\"\n\nShe continued: \"This will forever weigh over our family.\"\n\nWatkins' grandmother, Joann Clayton Parsons, also paid tribute to the boy and thanked the community for their support. \"I just want to think each and every one of you for all the sweet kind words and the prayers for my sweet great grandson Jace Watkins,\" she wrote in a Facebook post.\n\n\"He was so loved by everyone [and] our hearts are [broken], but you will never know what it meant to us for y’all to show so much love to us and to Jace,\" Joann said.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nCases of the flu continue to be on the rise in the United States, with the most recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control showing a 14% increase in hospitalizations and a 4% increase in visits to a medical care provider for respiratory illness.\n\nTwo pediatric deaths from the flu were also reported, the agency said.

    "fullText": "HONOLULU (AP) — Mike Lambert heard fewer illegal fireworks exploding in his suburban Honolulu neighborhood in the months after a chain of blasts at a house party last New Year's Eve led to the deaths of six people, including a 3-year-old boy.\n\nAs the director of Hawaii's Department of Law Enforcement, Lambert wondered if the tragedy had sparked a shift in Hawaii residents' penchant for igniting illegal fireworks. In some neighborhoods, it would be common to hear loud booms any time of day or night — for sporting events, celebrations or no apparent reason at all.\n\nBut this year, authorities are armed with stiffer laws created in the wake of the tragedy and will be giving out citations to offenders, Lambert warned.\n\n“We have no delusions that you can have a tragedy New Year’s, you can sign a law in July and then not have anything go off the following year,” he said. Still, he expects that some people will decide not to set off fireworks, either because of last year's deadly accident or the stepped-up enforcement and new laws.\n\n“Before, you could shoot it off with impunity,” said state Rep. Scot Matayoshi, who authored two of the five anti-fireworks bills. “Everyone knew they weren’t going to bust you.”\n\nPolice can now issue $300 tickets to those who shoot off fireworks, while repeat offenders and people whose actions cause serious injury or death could get prison time for felony crimes.\n\nMatayoshi said he began working on legislation the morning after the tragedy, which took place at a New Year's Eve 2025 celebration when crates of illegal fireworks tipped over and ignited in the Aliamanu neighborhood, illuminating the sky in a terrifying set of explosions that left more than a dozen people with severe burns.\n\n“It affected me a lot,” Matayoshi said. “I couldn’t imagine being the neighbor of someone who had basically bombs in their house going off and hurting and killing my kids.”\n\nNone of the the 12 people arrested have been charged with a crime. Honolulu police said they're working with prosecutors in seeking charges.\n\nA hopeful sign was an amnesty event last month where people turned in 500 pounds (227 kilograms) of illegal fireworks, Lambert said. His department has also increased searches at all ports, noting that illegal fireworks shipped to Hawaii often have ties to organized crime.\n\nAs of earlier this month, Honolulu police said officers had issued 10 fireworks citations. Matayoshi said the number is an improvement from zero in past years. He expects it to jump dramatically on New Year's Eve.\n\nFirecrackers to ring in the new year have long been popular in Hawaii, but about a decade ago, professional-grade aerials started becoming common.\n\n“You're seeing fireworks that were meant to be let off at like stadium and hotel events,\" Lambert said. Those pyrotechnics have a 900-foot (274-meter) blast radius, but are exploding in tightly packed neighborhoods where homes are often just a few feet apart, he said.\n\nArmy veteran Simeon Rojas grew up on Oahu in the 1980s and ’90s and enjoyed setting off firecrackers and lighting sparklers on New Year's Eve. He considers fireworks part of the local culture and tradition.\n\nBut when fireworks suddenly explode when he's at home in Honolulu's Kalihi Valley, “it does rock my heart,\" he said. It also triggers his post-traumatic stress disorder from serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n“It gives me flashbacks,” he said. “I stay with my wife and kids on New Year's Eve, so I feel safe.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump slathered a fresh coat of makeup on his hand for another round of peace talks with Ukraine on Sunday.\n\nTrump, 79, welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to his Mar-a-Lago estate as he continues to chase down an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, which he promised to end on his first day back in office.\n\nThe mismatched concealer on Trump’s hand was once again evident as he took questions from reporters.\n\nJust days ago, on Christmas Eve, the now-familiar bruising on Trump’s right hand was coupled with some discoloration on his left. On Sunday, however, his left hand seemed back to normal, while his right hand remained covered in makeup.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reverted to a statement she has been reusing since February when reached for comment by the Daily Beast.\n\n“President Trump is a man of the people and he meets more Americans and shakes their hands on a daily basis than any other President in history. His commitment is unwavering and he proves that every single day,” she said.\n\nLeavitt previously attributed the persistent bruising to “minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.”\n\nThe Daily Beast has closely catalogued the bruising on Trump’s hand, which he has been nursing for months. The makeup smears, together with Trump’s swollen ankles, mysterious MRI, mental flubs, and twice-in-a-year “annual” medical checkups, have raised concerns about the health of the oldest person to be inaugurated president.\n\nThe White House has consistently maintained that Trump is in “excellent health.”\n\nThe president was joined by several of his officials in Mar-a-Lago as he sat down for another meeting with Zelensky, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, special envoy Steve Witkoff, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nA day before the meeting, Russia struck Kyiv with ballistic missiles and drones, killing at least one person and injuring 27 others.\n\nDespite the attack, Trump said he still believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was “very serious” about finding common ground with Ukraine.\n\n“I do believe that we have the makings of a deal that’s good for Ukraine, that’s good for everybody. There’s nothing more important,” he told reporters. “I’ve settled eight wars and this is the most difficult one. I thought it would be in the middle of the pack. This is the most difficult one, but we’re gonna get it done.”\n\nThe president stopped short of laying out a timeline for the end of peace talks.\n\n“I don’t have deadlines,” he said. “You know what my deadline is? Getting the war ended.”",

Climate activists contend such plans may conflict with the country’s pledges to help curb climate change and could lock South Korea into a fossil fuel-dependent future.\n\nTalks are underway for South Korea to invest $350 billion in U.S. projects and purchase up to $100 billion worth of U.S. energy products, including LNG, a natural gas cooled to liquid form for easy storage and travel. It burns cleaner than coal, but still causes planet-warming emissions, especially of methane.\n\nSouth Korea’s overall LNG imports may not increase if it offsets purchases of more U.S. natural gas by reducing imports from other sources such as Australia and the Middle East.\n\nStill, it's unclear how South Korea will “manage and consolidate all this somehow contradictory planning regarding its energy sector,\" said Michelle Kim, an energy specialist for the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\n\nPower transition sparks climate goals\n\nSouth Korea's liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who won a snap election in June, campaigned for stronger climate commitments. They had softened under his conservative predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted after a short-lived martial law declaration.\n\n“As the global temperature rises, we all need to responsibly take climate action and Korea will have a stronger sense of responsibility in tackling the climate crisis,\" Kim Sung-hwan, the inaugural Minister of Climate, Energy and Environment, said in an interview with The Associated Press.\n\nSouth Korea's goal to cut carbon emissions by 53% to 61% of its 2018 level, fell short of climate activists’ expectations. Business lobbies representing major manufacturers had proposed a 48% emissions reduction target.\n\n“This range presents an effort by the government to accommodate two very different ways of thinking about the economic and climate future of the nation,” said Joojin Kim of the Seoul-based advocacy group, Solutions for Our Climate.\n\nSouth Korea faces climate dilemma over U.S. deal\n\nThe South Korean government made the ambitious commitment to increase its clean energy use even after Trump's sweeping ‘America First’ tariffs spurred energy negotiations between Seoul and Washington.\n\nAs part of its broader efforts to avoid higher tariffs, South Korea offered to import more LNG from the U.S., but the final trade deal has not been announced.\n\nThe agreement still under negotiation could last between three to 10 years, according to industry analysis and U.S. federal documents. Depending on the deal's duration, South Korea may import between 3 million to 9 million tons of American LNG a year.\n\nLNG made up almost a fifth of South Korea’s total energy supply last year, according to the International Energy Agency, or IEA. The government's target was to cut that to 10.6% by 2038.\n\nSouth Korea risks its climate goals if the pending trade deal increases the total volume of imported LNG, which will likely lead to an oversupply issue and the excess burning of gas to justify the deal, said Insung Lee, with Greenpeace in Seoul.\n\n“If we just replace coal plants with LNG, that means the coal exit actually doesn’t lead to a green transition and merely shifts Korea’s addiction from coal to gas, which undermines the whole spirit of climate action,\" Lee said.\n\nRenewable energy generated 7% of South Korea’s domestic power in 2022, according to the IEA. South Korean government data show that had increased to 10.5% last year, still one of the lowest levels among leading economies.\n\nJapan, with an economy more than twice as big, generates 21% of its power from renewable sources. Spain, whose economy is about the same size as South Korea's, gets 42% of its power from renewable sources.\n\nClean energy provided about 30% of global electricity production in 2023.\n\nNuclear power produces a major share of South Korea's domestic energy, with government data showing that nuclear sources accounted for 31% of total electricity generation last year.\n\n“We will transition into a new energy system that focuses on renewables and nuclear, while phasing out coal,” said Kim, the energy minister. He said South Korea will use LNG as a “complementary or emergency energy source” to make up for irregularities in renewable energy supplies.\n\nIn early December, South Korea set another goal of boosting its offshore wind power capacity to 4 gigawatts, about 10 times the current level.\n\nSouth Korean companies that don’t cut back on carbon emissions may find that to be a competitive disadvantage, said Michelle Kim of the IEEFA.\n\nMany global industries, including shipping and aviation, face pressure to reduce their emissions by providing incentives for low emitters and creating deterrents for high ones, she said.\n\n“This is a lot of risk,” she said. “South Korea needs to speed up renewable energy deployment and come out from high dependency on the fossil fuel industry.”\n\nCoal trade braces for South Korea cuts\n\nAt last month's climate talks, South Korea joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance, a group of businesses, organizations and governments promoting the green energy transition.\n\nThat's mainly a symbolic move, said Bruce Douglas, with the Global Renewables Alliance. “But it signifies very clear government intention to move away from fossil fuels and towards clean power.”\n\nSouth Korea imports virtually all its coal, largely from Australia, Indonesia and Russia, and the switch to renewables is bound to impact regional markets.\n\nThe pledge to retire 40 of South Korea's 61 coal sites by 2040 may be “an enforced transition\" for coal exporters in the Asia-Pacific region, said James Bowen, with Climate Analytics. “It’s a reality that they’re going to have to face this downturn in the market.”\n\n“The writing's on the wall,\" Bowen said. “One of the biggest importers in the world, one of the biggest customers, is starting to move away from coal.”\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

    "fullText": "The Knesset moved to prohibit brothel operations nationwide, with officials stressing that prostitution will not disappear without coordinated action and local enforcement.\n\nThe Knesset’s Internal Affairs and Environment Committee has commenced action to ban the operations of brothels, the governing body announced on Sunday.\n\nCommittee chairman MK Yitzhak Kreuzer said that prostitution exists in the State of Israel and will not disappear without being properly addressed. In February 2025, Justice Minister Yariv Levin announced that a once-temporary law, which prohibited the consumption of prostitution, introduced in July 2020, became permanent.\n\nThe law made it illegal for individuals to purchase sex, with penalties ranging from administrative fines to criminal charges. These efforts were cited as efforts to combat human trafficking within Israel.\n\n\"There are authorities that deal with it, and there are those that ignore it, and in many cases, the phenomenon only worsens,” Kreuzer stated, adding that the topic was discussed following a request from Israeli NGO, Task Force on Human Trafficking and Prostitution.\n\nMoriah Rodel-Silfan, CEO of the organization, said in a statement that authorities can either ignore the issue or approach it head-on for a solution. She called on local authorities to act to eradicate the issue.\n\nLior Rosenbaum, a representative of the headquarters to combat trafficking of women, added that failing to act on the issue would only allow it to grow. Rosenbaum praised the Tel Aviv municipality for its successful fight against prostitution, resulting in the closure of brothels and discreet operations in the city.\n\nDeputy Mayor of Jerusalem Adir Schwartz told authorities in the Knesset that in Jerusalem, prostitution is largely concentrated on youth from the Haredi community, noting municipal plans and efforts to reduce prostitution.\n\nHealth Ministry representatives added that sex workers in Israel are not largely “street” workers, and outside enforcement would be needed to combat efforts.\n\nMaya Baron, Director of the Extreme Risk & Trauma Field at Israeli NGO ELEM, focused on youth in distress in Israel, noted the difference between prostitution in men and women in a statement. “Women engage in prostitution in discreet apartments, while men are on the street. Opening the doors of local authorities and acquiring the appropriate knowledge will enable assistance and response.\"\n\nDuring the meeting, MK Adi Aziz, among others, questioned police representatives about police raids on brothels and discreet apartments. She stated that raids were often not conducted in helpful manners to girls impacted; she cited a lack of social workers involved in the matter to assist survivors during the investigation and help them navigate alternative housing and rehabilitation.\n\nPolice representatives responded, stating that additional brothels would soon be closed through administrative orders, as well as additional efforts to be made in rehabilitation for survivors in cooperation with the Social Affairs Ministry.\n\nSurvivors testified in Knesset, including D. McCullough, who emphasized local authorities' role in combating prostitution. “The prostitution industry is not only a crime but also an industry, and if it has no way of making money, it will not operate. The local authorities have the power to strangle the prostitution industry economically, and that is enormous power,” McCullough told Knesset representatives.\n\n“If the brothel is masquerading as residential apartments, then the apartment is not operating according to its purpose, and therefore the brothel needs to be closed, and the more you close, the less profitable it will be for pimps to open in the city. Every brothel that is closed saves a lot of women and girls,” they added. “A brothel that closes saves the ugly spots from your city, so you should close them.\"",

    "fullText": "At some point, sneakers, which used to be solely about athletic performance, crossed over into fashion.\n\nBefore his wedding, my brother actually told me that he had to tell his friends they could not wear Jordans with their Hugo Boss tuxedos. Being a little older than the rest of the wedding party, it never occurred to me that sneakers had become so fashionable that some people would wear them in a situation that calls for dress shoes.\n\nClearly, sneakers have crossed over culturally, with certain models now functioning as luxury items, despite their athletic roots. That shift helps explain why the resale market has grown so rapidly and why collectors are willing to pay premium prices.\n\n“What began as a niche culture among sneakerheads has now become part of everyday fashion. Sneakers have evolved into investment pieces, with some models seeing enormous value increases,” Vinted Senior Brand Expert Jens Kuhlmann told AIM Group for its report, \"Running up a $30 billion business: How sneaker resale has gone global.\"\n\nSneakers have also become an investment.\n\n“The unregulated aftermarket or resale market for sneakers and streetwear is scaling at a rapid growth rate, fueled by lean inventory from major sneaker brands (e.g., Nike), consistent drops of new releases, deep sneaker archives from which to draw for future releases, an endless aisle, a community of like-minded enthusiasts, and digital marketplaces that offer transparency and ease of use,” according to Cowen's Sneakers As An Alternative Asset Class.\n\nThat has created a market and launched a number of retailers that specialize in selling and reselling sneakers. One of those chains, Soleply, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this year and has since closed four of its six stores.\n\nSoleply filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March after taking on too much debt and unsustainable leases, according to court documents filed with PacerMonitor.\n\nThe sneaker reseller noted in its bankruptcy filing that the move is due to “financial distress” largely driven by \"high-interest, short-term debt used to fund store expansions, which created a cycle of inventory shortages and cash flow instability that ultimately proved unsustainable,\" WWD.com reported.\n\nThe retail chain sells streetwear and sneakers from brands including Asics, Nike, Jordan, and New Balance. It shared in its filing that while each store was initially profitable, the burden of debt repayment soon began to take its toll.\n\n“Cash flow constraints forced Soleply to divert substantial revenue toward loan payments, leaving insufficient capital to maintain adequate inventory levels,” the filing said. “As a result, some stores struggled to sustain the same level of sales, and the company faced mounting financial challenges.”",

    "fullText": "Staying warm and off the road is better than Ezra\n\nAs Winter Storm Ezra intensifies across the central and eastern United States, the freight industry faces a severe threat from high winds that could blow over trailers, disrupting operations and endangering drivers. The storm, which began escalating on Sunday, is unleashing gusts of 50+ mph in parts of the Upper Midwest, with impacts stretching east of Interstate 35, according to real-time data from SONAR Critical Events. SONAR is actively monitoring the situation, providing critical insights to assess and mitigate the storm’s impact on the freight market as conditions worsen.\n\nHigh winds are a massive hazard for truckers, as their trailers become kites in 40+mph winds. \n\nThis can happen on the highway, right next to you as you drive with your family. You can become a victim of a trailer being blown over. \n\nExercise extra caution this week in highways… https://t.co/fWAw5ufbZo\n\n(@FreightAlley) December 29, 2025\n\nHigh Winds Turn Trailers into Hazards, Urging Drivers to Stay Home\n\nSONAR Critical Events has issued high wind alerts for regions east of I-35, with gusts of 50+ mph reported in the Upper Midwest. The platform is tracking an extratropical cyclone set to impact the U.S. and Canada from 2:00 AM EST on December 29 through 3:00 AM EST on December 30, offering freight operators data to navigate potential market disruptions. Winds exceeding 40 mph pose a critical risk, turning truck trailers into kite-like structures vulnerable to rollovers—especially on highways with dense traffic in the Midwest.\n\nThis hazard threatens not only freight movement but also the safety of drivers and other road users. SONAR’s data highlights “High Road Danger” conditions across states like Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, and the Northeast, as well as Canadian provinces like Ontario and Quebec, where road obstructions, collisions, and closures are already emerging. Truck drivers are strongly urged to stay home if possible to avoid these life-threatening risks as the storm peaks Monday.\n\nSONAR Critical Events: Monitoring Wind Impacts on Freight Stability\n\nSONAR’s real-time monitoring provides a detailed wind forecast to help the freight industry prepare. The latest update includes:\n\nWind Gusts: Ranging from 30 to 45 mph, with maxima reaching 50 mph, particularly in the Upper Midwest, where Michigan’s Upper Peninsula has already seen gusts exceeding 65 km/h (40 mph).\n\nImpact Areas: States east of I-35, including the Great Lakes region and Northeast, are under close watch as SONAR evaluates potential delays and cost increases.\n\nMarket Implications: The combination of strong winds and blowing snow reduces visibility and increases the likelihood of trailer rollovers, potentially driving up insurance costs and shipment delays.\n\nSONAR’s advanced mapping tools enable logistics managers to identify high-risk lanes where staying off the road is the safest option. The platform’s recommendation to avoid driving aligns with efforts to protect drivers and stabilize freight operations during the storm’s height.\n\nIndustry Response and Preparedness\n\nWinter Storm Ezra’s rapid intensification has SONAR on high alert, with enhanced collaboration with WeatherOptics delivering hyperlocal wind insights to help carriers adjust schedules and mitigate market instability. SONAR is also tracking lake-effect snow driven by these winds, with potential accumulations up to 60 cm (24 inches) along Lake Superior’s south shore, which could further disrupt cross-border freight from Canada. The focus remains on keeping trailers upright, with drivers encouraged to stay home if their routes fall within these danger zones.\n\nLooking Ahead: SONAR’s Ongoing Analysis Through Tuesday\n\nAs the Arctic air mass fueling Ezra interacts with warmer southern air, SONAR predicts the storm’s wind-driven impacts, including trailer rollover risks, will persist through Tuesday. The platform is continuously analyzing high road danger conditions and potential shipment delays affecting tens of millions across the Plains to the Northeast.\n\nLogistics managers should leverage SONAR Critical Events for updates, preparing for extended transit times on east-west routes where crosswinds are most severe. The clear message to truck drivers: stay home if possible to avoid the devastating impact of a trailer blown over by gusts. This real-time intelligence is crucial for optimizing freight market resilience.\n\nFreightWaves will continue to track Winter Storm Ezra’s progression, relying on SONAR’s monitoring to keep the industry informed. With winds threatening to topple trailers across the eastern U.S., safety and strategic planning are paramount. Stay tuned for further developments as the storm unfolds.\n\nThe post Truckers east of I-35 advised to stay home appeared first on FreightWaves.",

The loss combined with a runaway New England win over the New York Jets earlier Sunday secured the AFC East title for the Patriots.\n\nAfter being held off the scoreboard for the first 54 minutes of the game, the Bills rallied to score two touchdowns in the final 5:11. But they trailed 13-12 after the second touchdown thanks to a blocked extra point on their first.\n\nAt that point, with both teams exhausted and the game clock almost expired, the Bills opted to gamble with a 2-point conversion attempt instead of kicking and extra point for overtime. The gamble failed when Josh Allen's pass fell incomplete in the end zone. Fittingly, Allen threw the ill-fated pass under duress from Philadelphia's pass rush.\n\nALLEN'S PASS IS INCOMPLETE. THE EAGLES WILL WIN!! pic.twitter.com/hixSq2sZfa\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 29, 2025\n\nThe Eagles, meanwhile, entered Sunday locked into the NFC East title and out of the No. 1 seed in the NFC. They didn't have much to play for. But they improved their chances of moving past the Chicago Bears from the No. 3 seed to No. 2 with Sunday's win.\n\nAnd, perhaps, more importantly, their defense was overwhelming in a game that was billed as a potential Super Bowl preview.\n\nThe Bills have long operated as a second-half team and entered Sunday's game leading the NFL in second-half point differential (+109). They added to that differential with a 12-0 advantage after halftime. But it wasn't enough to secure the win after a dominant effort from Philadelphia's defense through most of the game.\n\nThe Eagles limited the Bills to three punts and a fumble in the first half en route to a 13-0 lead. They set the tone early with a sack of Josh Allen that forced a fumble that bounced from the Buffalo 30-yard line into Philadelphia territory.\n\nOUR BALL pic.twitter.com/qjS9W0nE3F\n\n— Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) December 28, 2025\n\nPhiladelphia recovered and converted the turnover into a Jalen Hurts touchdown pass to Dallas Goedert for a 7-0 lead. From there, the Bills were playing on the their heels against a Philadelphia defensive front that dominated their offensive line.\n\nWhen the Bills punted to conclude the opening drive of the second half after a scoreless first, fans who weathered cold rain in the Buffalo stands responded with boos.\n\nThe Bills didn't broach the red zone until the final five minutes of the third quarter. When they got to fourth-and-goal, they didn't convert.\n\nAllen took off for the end zone when he couldn't find an open receiver in the end zone. He escaped pressure only to be met by multiple Eagles defenders at the goal line. Zack Baun tackled him short of the goal line to force a turnover on downs.\n\nJosh Allen does not get there and the Eagles force the turnover on downs at the goal line!\n\n📺: FOX pic.twitter.com/HQgLCcm9OS\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 28, 2025\n\nBuffalo's next possession started at Philadelphia's 41 after the Eagles punted from their own end zone. It ended with another punt after Josh Allen lost 19 yards on a third-down sack.\n\nAgain, Allen couldn't find any open receivers. This time he ran backward in a failed effort to buy time from the Eagles' pass rush before Jalyx Hunt took him down for his second sack of the day.\n\nOn the Hunt pic.twitter.com/t3ipIHeMwR\n\n— Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) December 28, 2025\n\nPhiladelphia's offense was somehow worse in a second half that produced just 17 yards from scrimmage. But the Bills mustered too little too late after failing to score until an Allen touchdown sneak with 5:11 remaining.\n\nThe Bills mounted their late, last touchdown drive after forcing the fourth straight Philadelphia three-and-out of the second half. And they kept hope alive with a fourth-and-10 hook-and-lateral that set up a deep pass from Allen to Brandin Cooks to get into the red zone.\n\nARE YOU SERIOUS!?\n\n📺: FOX pic.twitter.com/MRjder4QGo\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 29, 2025\n\nBut Philadelphia's defense ultimately came up with one last stop on the 2-point conversion to secure the win.\n\nWhen the day was done, the Eagles had sacked Allen five times for a loss of 51 yards. They hit him six other times and kept the pressure on almost every time he dropped back. And they came up with stops when it mattered most.\n\nThe offensive woes that have plagued Philadelphia for much of the season continued as the Bills outgained the Eagles, 330-190. But the defense that anchored the Eagles' 10-5 start was good enough to secured win No. 11 on Sunday.",

That feels like two different things, doesn’t it? “Departs” sounds like it’s Lowery’s choice…. “will not return” doesn’t quite get to that same point.\n\nZaide Lowery came into his junior year with a bright future as a contributor for Shaka Smart and the Golden Eagles. He closed the 2024-25 season strong, and with the departure of three starters from that season, it made all the sense in the world for Lowery to leapfrog off that strong finish to a spot in the starting lineup. That’s what we saw from him this season, and in Marquette’s first nine games, he averaged 9.0 points, 3.4 rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 1.2 steals in over 25 minutes per game.\n\nHowever, he was also shooting just 38% from the field and 32% from behind the three-point line, and in the wake of a 5-4 start for Marquette and coming off an 0-for-5 from the field performance, Lowery was swapped out of the starting lineup in favor of freshman Adrien Stevens against Wisconsin. Lowery played 14 minutes in that contest, and 12 against Purdue, both poor showings for the Golden Eagles in road losses.\n\nOn December 17th, Marquette opened up Big East play against Georgetown, and Lowery didn’t play at all. After the game, head coach Shaka Smart had this to say on the topic:\n\n“It’s a coach’s decision,” Smart said. “We’re continuing to try to evaluate and figure out what the best lineups are and what guys we need to have in the game.\n\n“From the standpoint, first and foremost, of who truly wants to pour into the other four guys with him out on the floor and be all in on Marquette. So that goes into who we play.”\n\nOn December 20th, right at the Big East required deadline to announce player availability for that night’s game against Creighton, Marquette announced that Lowery didn’t make the trip to Omaha with the team to face the Bluejays for personal reasons. That can be a lot of things, of course, and after the game, Smart gave zero indication that anything was out of line regarding Lowery’s status with the team. Ben Steele from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel point blank asked Smart if Lowery was suspended or leaving the team, and both times, Smart answered “Nope.”\n\nAsked Shaka Smart about Zaide Lowery not making trip with #mubb to Omaha:\n\n\"Just wasn't here for personal reasons.\"\n\nNot suspended?\n\n\"Nope\"\n\nNot leaving the team?\n\n\"Nope\"\n\n— Ben Steele (@BenSteeleMJS) December 21, 2025\n\nThose answers may have been true at the time, so I’m not going to jump up and down and demand accountability from Smart on that one….. but eight days later, Lowery is in fact leaving the team, presumably for reasons stemming from/related to Smart’s lack of interest in putting the Missourian on the floor against Georgetown.\n\nAlthough…. Steele seems to imply here that Smart’s answers were not 100% on the level at the time.\n\nIt was a tumultuous two months for Zaide Lowery at Marquette.\n\nStarted the first nine games, then lost starting gig. Playing time dwindled, culminating in a DNP-CD and not traveling with team as future plans got sorted out. #mubbhttps://t.co/nuN9lARxBI\n\n— Ben Steele (@BenSteeleMJS) December 28, 2025\n\nI’m not wrong, correct? “Not traveling with team as future plans got sorted out” definitely sounds like the departure was already in the works when the team left for Nebraska, right? Just something to think about.\n\nAnd so, it’s time for a new scholarship chart.\n\nLowery’s departure opens up spot #15 for the 2026-27 season. That alone will not cause Shaka Smart to head to the transfer portal for any new faces next season. Marquette will add two new freshmen this summer in Alex Egbuonu and Ethan Johnston, while Ian Miletic, Sheek Pearson, and Nash Walker will finish their redshirt seasons and move to the active roster in the fall of 2026. Finding playing time for 14 guys is hard enough, and when you’re mixing in that many new guys, why overcomplicate things with just one player who almost assuredly will not be someone who will make a major impact.\n\nOf course, that’s operating under the idea that Marquette is projected to have 14 guys on the roster when the ball goes in the air for real in November of 2026. Whether or not Zaide Lowery is the first departure from this team…. that’s something we’re going to have to wait until April to know for sure.\n\nFollow Anonymous Eagle on social media\n\nFacebook: AnonymousEagle\nInstagram: AnonymousEagleSBN\nBluesky: AnonymousEagle",

    "fullText": "Game update (Sunday evening): With Buffalo’s loss to the Eagles, the Patriots have clinched the AFC East.\n\nGame update: New England’s blowout win over the New York Jets moves the Patriots one step closer to clinching the AFC East. If the Bills lose or tie against the Eagles later today, the Patriots will clinch the AFC East title.\n\nIf Buffalo wins that game, New England can clinch the AFC East with a win over the Dolphins next week.\n\nNew England’s win also prevents the Broncos from clinching the No. 1 seed in the AFC. The Patriots can still catch Denver in that race. Both teams are now 13-3, and while the Broncos have a tiebreaker advantage over New England based on their record against common opponents, the Patriots can still secure the No. 1 seed in Week 18 with a win and a Denver loss.\n\nThe New England Patriots missed a golden opportunity to clinch the AFC East in Week 15, when they blew a 21-0 lead and lost to the Buffalo Bills.\n\nBut the upstart Patriots can finish the job in Week 17, albeit with a little bit of help.\n\nHere is how the Patriots can clinch the AFC East for the first time since the 2019 season, Tom Brady’s last campaign in New England.\n\nThe Patriots control their own destiny in the race with the Bills for the division title, but to clinch this weekend, they will need a little bit of help from a team that beat them in Super Bowl LII.\n\nNew England sits atop the division with a 12-3 record, one game ahead of the 11-4 Bills. With wins in their final two games (starting this weekend against the New York Jets, and then in the season finale against the Miami Dolphins), then the Patriots are division champions.\n\nHowever, New England can clinch the division this weekend, and start celebrating early. With a win over the Jets, and a Bills loss or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles, the Patriots are AFC East champions.\n\nNew England can also clinch the division with a tie against the Jets, and a Bills loss to the Eagles.\n\nThe Patriots are also in the running for the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but the advantage is in the Denver Broncos’ favor. Denver’s win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night improved their record to 13-3, and the Broncos have already clinched a tiebreaker advantage over the Patriots based on common games, which is the third tiebreaker after head-to-head (these two teams did not play this year) and record in conference games.\n\nNew England needs to win to keep their hopes for the No. 1 seed alive. A loss eliminates the Patriots from contention for the top spot in the AFC.\n\nHere are the full AFC standings entering Week 17:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (11-4) – x\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x\n\nx – Team has clinched a playoff spot\ne – Team has been eliminated from playoff contention\n\nAFC East standings entering Week 17:\n\nHere are the current AFC East standings:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x",

We knew that and we tried to do our best. In the first half they allowed us something down the right, but we lacked clarity in the final 15 metres. Still, the team did a great job, including the substitutes, who were decisive, especially Pio Esposito. But also the others, who rolled up their sleeves when it was needed in the final minutes.”\n\nBARI, ITALY – AUGUST 16: Francesco Pio Esposito of Inter during Pre-Season Friendly match between FC Internazionale and Olympiacos FC at Stadio San Nicola on August 16, 2025 in Bari, Italy. (Photo by Maurizio Lagana/Getty Images)\n\nThe Inter coach then expanded on the value of his young forward, who provided the assist for Lautaro Martinez’s winning goal against Atalanta.\n\n“I have four forwards who have all left a strong mark on our league campaign,” Chivu explained.\n\n“Pio is fundamental, just like Bonny. You already know the value of Lautaro and Thuram. Pio and Bonny are players who make themselves loved by the group.”\n\nChivu’s words underlined the trust he places in Inter’s attacking depth and the importance of squad unity, particularly in a demanding away fixture that required patience, resilience and decisive moments from the bench.\n\nWith the year ending on a high, Inter head into the new calendar year with momentum, confidence and growing belief in the club’s next generation.",

At the moment we’re top, but there are still a lot of matches to play. We have to stay focused and always give our maximum.”\n\nThe discussion then turned to his personal form and the perception that Chivu has revitalised him. Zielinski did not shy away from responsibility.\n\n“Of course, the responsibility was above all mine,” he admitted. “I didn’t arrive in the best condition, with those famous blisters,” he added with a laugh. “Injuries, serious and less serious, affected me, but that’s all behind me now.”\n\nThe Polish international concluded by underlining his mindset going forward. “I’m thinking about what I can give to the team. Now you’re seeing the best version of me.”",

    "fullText": "Cristian Chivu warns Inter are ‘ready to fight’ after victory away to Atalanta, but won’t get drawn into more controversy. ‘I am not interested in what Antonio Conte says.’\n\nThe Nerazzurri were feeling the pressure after a disappointing Supercoppa Italiana in Riyadh, where they lost to Bologna on penalties in the semi-final and made an early return home.\n\nThey had a goal disallowed in Bergamo for offside before Lautaro Martinez made the most of a Berat Djimsiti howler, his pass intercepted by substitute Francesco Pio Esposito.\n\nRemarkably, Esposito had only been introduced for Marcus Thuram a few moments earlier, so made an immediate impact.\n\nBERGAMO, ITALY – DECEMBER 28: FC Internazionale coach Cristian Chivu looks on during the Serie A match between Atalanta BC and FC Internazionale at New Balance Arena on December 28, 2025 in Bergamo, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\n“I am pleased with Marcus too today, as he worked hard and wore down their defence with the right movements, but he was running out of steam, so I introduced Pio,” Chivu told DAZN Italia.\n\n“He came on with the right attitude and intercepted that ball, sending Lautaro on goal. I’m happy with the whole team today, who tried to control the game in the first half, then Atalanta stepped up their counter-measures by going man for man after the break.\n\n“We’re also pleased with the result, because that might not be the only thing that counts, but it’s certainly important.”\n\nPio Esposito was the only other striker available, as Ange-Yoan Bonny had been ruled out of the trip with a sprained ankle.\n\n“These are all players who work hard, put the effort in, and help the team when called upon. We are happy to have four great strikers, that they are all scoring goals and working well together,” noted Chivu.\n\nBERGAMO, ITALY – DECEMBER 28: FC Internazionale coach Cristian Chivu reacts during the Serie A match between Atalanta BC and FC Internazionale at New Balance Arena on December 28, 2025 in Bergamo, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nIt means Inter end 2025 on top of the Serie A table and with their captain scoring in four consecutive league games. Considering their pedigree and history, is their presence at the top to be taken for granted?\n\n“Nothing can be taken for granted in football. You need to work hard and prove yourself competitive on the pitch. However, we’re not even halfway through the season yet, so we know there’s a long path ahead of us, that at times we will have to fight against injustice, against those who think it is all to be taken for granted.\n\n“Ultimately, the only proof is on the pitch. We are giving it our all, trying to respond blow for blow to the other teams, and keeping our heads up high. We are ready to keep fighting even harder.”\n\nBERGAMO, ITALY – DECEMBER 28: Piotr Zielinski of FC Internazionale in action during the Serie A match between Atalanta BC and FC Internazionale at New Balance Arena on December 28, 2025 in Bergamo, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nAmong the things they have to battle against are also the comments of Napoli coach Conte, who again said today that Inter, Juventus and AC Milan are the favourites for the Scudetto. What is Chivu’s response?\n\n“I am not interested in what Conte says,” he shrugged.\n\nChivu was informed that the word of 2025 was ‘faith’ and so what would his word of 2026 be to describe Inter?\n\n“I haven’t finished 2025 yet, give me four days and then I might answer when the first game of 2026 comes around! I hope to be there, at least…”",

    "fullText": "Inter Milan head coach Cristian Chivu praised the courage and adaptability of his side after their 1-0 win over Atalanta, highlighting the impact of young forwards Ange-Yoan Bonny and Pio Esposito as the Nerazzurri closed 2025 alone at the top of Serie A.\n\nSpeaking to DAZN after the final whistle in Bergamo, with quotes via FCInterNews, Cristian Chivu reflected on a performance that could have produced a wider margin.\n\nHowever, it was ultimately decided by Lautaro Martinez’s finish.\n\nAsked about Inter stepping outside their comfort zone, particularly the substitution of Marcus Thuram for Pio Esposito, which led to the winning assist, Chivu stressed collective effort above individual moments.\n\n“I’m happy with Marcus’ performance,” he said.\n\n“He worked hard, occupied the defenders, ran a lot and applied the right pressure. Then, when we felt he had given everything, Pio came on and played Lautaro through on goal. But I’m happy with the attitude of the entire team. In the first half we played more football. Then, after the break, they raised their counter-measure by going man-to-man. We’re pleased with the result because, as you always remind me, results often matter a lot.”\n\nBARI, ITALY – AUGUST 16: Francesco Pio Esposito of Inter during Pre-Season Friendly match between FC Internazionale and Olympiacos FC at Stadio San Nicola on August 16, 2025 in Bari, Italy. (Photo by Maurizio Lagana/Getty Images)\n\nChivu then broadened the focus to Inter’s young attacking stars.\n\nIndeed, rejecting the idea that Pio Esposito is developing in isolation.\n\n“Bonny is there as well, let’s not forget him,” he insisted.\n\n“They’re players who work hard and have earned the affection of the group. They always contribute, whether they start or come on as substitutes. We’re happy to have four forwards who provide this kind of input.”\n\nDespite Inter ending the year in first place, Chivu rejected any suggestion that their position should be taken for granted.\n\n“In football, nothing is guaranteed,” he explained.\n\n“To be competitive, you have to dare and show it on the pitch. The pitch says this right now. However, it’s still December and we haven’t even finished the first half of the season. We know the road is long. We know we want to be competitive and we know we have to work. And sometimes we have to fight against injustices and against those who think everything is obvious.”\n\nHe added: “We know the pitch is what shows the real value of a team and a competition. We’re trying in every possible way, in good times and bad, responding blow for blow. We always keep our heads high and react to difficulties. And we’re ready to fight and work even harder.”\n\nMILAN, ITALY – OCTOBER 04: FC Internazionale coach Cristian Chivu looks on before the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and US Cremonese at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on October 04, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nWhen asked whether recent jabs from Antonio Conte formed part of that battle, Chivu was curt.\n\n“What Conte says doesn’t interest me,” he replied.\n\nOn the theme of trust, Chivu avoided grand declarations about the future.\n\n“We still have to finish 2025,” he smiled. “I struggle to think about it now, my head’s spinning. Maybe after the first match of 2026 I’ll tell you.”\n\nFinally, when reminded that the new year will open with a fixture against Bologna, Chivu closed the interview with humour.\n\n“I hope to be there,” he joked, drawing laughter from those present.",

We are Inter.” The winger admitted that this demanding environment played a major role in the challenges he faced early on.\n\nReflecting on the toughest and most motivating moments of the season so far, Henrique added: “The most difficult moment was the defeat against Bologna.\n\nThe best one is always the next match.” It was a response that underlined both disappointment and ambition within the squad.\n\nFinally, the Brazilian directly addressed his slow start. “The difficulties came from the high level at Inter,” he explained, “and because I needed time to fit into the team’s playing dynamics.” His display against Atalanta suggested that process is now well underway.",

Rather than setting specific targets, he stressed consistency and learning.\n\n“I’m not expecting anything in particular from 2026,” he explained.\n\n“I just try to keep going with my mentality. Work every day and learn from him and from the other champions here.

It was a direct clash and Atalanta are a strong team that have done a lot in recent years. You have to face them with what you’ve prepared.\n\n“There was a different coach before and it was difficult under another system too. We played a match similar to the recent ones. We still have to improve, but I’m happy. It’s a gift for the fans and for the families who are always behind us.”\n\nLautaro then turned his attention to Esposito, highlighting the importance of patience and trust in young players.\n\n“I talk about him often and I speak with him every day. He wants to learn and do well, and that’s part of growth. You have to keep him calm and give him the chance to make mistakes. I believe he’ll give great satisfaction to us and also to the Italian national team. Which is important for you.”\n\nMILAN, ITALY – SEPTEMBER 30: Lautaro Martinez of FC Internazionale celebrates after scoring their team’s first goal during the UEFA Champions League 2025/26 League Phase MD2 match between FC Internazionale Milano and SK Slavia Praha at Stadio San Siro on September 30, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nThe Inter captain also paid tribute to the club’s staff, explaining how their work helped him rediscover top form after a difficult end to last season.\n\n“Years pass for everyone. I finished last season badly with a hamstring injury. I got injured before the final. Then we went to the World Cup and then to international duty. I worked hard to be in good shape. With young guys pushing behind you, they raise the level. You have to be ready and willing to grow, and I have that desire every day.”\n\nSpeaking to InterTV after the match, Lautaro underlined the collective effort behind the win.\n\n“It’s an important victory from a team that wants to send signals. We were facing a tough side that make things dirty. We prepared the match and approached it perfectly.\n\n“There are still things to improve and we must work on that. I’m satisfied with the team’s work and with the substitutes who came on. That’s important for the growth of this group.”",

    "fullText": "CLEVELAND (AP) — The Pittsburgh Steelers have had multiple chances to clinch the AFC North.\n\nThey’re down to their final one.\n\nAaron Rodgers was limited to 168 yards passing and failed to lead a scoring drive on six second-half possessions, allowing the Cleveland Browns to top Pittsburgh 13-6 on Sunday.\n\nThe Steelers (9-7) could have locked up a playoff berth with a victory over last-place Cleveland, or if the Baltimore Ravens (8-8) had lost to Green Bay on Saturday. The Ravens remained alive with a 41-24 triumph over the Packers.\n\nAs a result, Pittsburgh will host the Ravens in Week 18 with the division crown and the final AFC postseason spot on the line in a winner-take-all matchup.\n\n“The competitor in me is saying, ‘We lost this game. We lost a chance to clinch today,’” Steelers defensive tackle Cam Heyward said. “But it’s also like, ‘Bring it on. Baltimore is coming in.’\n\n“Winner takes all. Let’s win it at home.”\n\nThe Steelers lost in Cleveland for the fourth year in a row and didn’t reach the end zone against the Browns for the first time since Dec. 10, 2009. Chris Boswell made a pair of field goals in the second quarter before missing a 54-yarder early in the fourth.\n\nRodgers completed 21 of 39 passes without an interception, but his team did not score a touchdown for just the seventh time in his 256 starts over 21 seasons. He is 1-6 in those games.\n\n“We’ve handled adversity well when we had to play our best football, other than today,” Rodgers said. “I have full confidence we’ll go home and win next week. It’s not difficult (to bounce back). It’s our job, playing all 17 games.”\n\nAndre Szmyt accounted for the only points in the second half, making a 33-yard field goal with 1:40 remaining to extend Cleveland’s lead to 13-6. Shedeur Sanders threw a 28-yard TD pass to fellow rookie Harold Fannin Jr. to put the Browns up 10-0 in the first quarter.\n\nThough Pittsburgh was out of timeouts with 100 seconds left, Rodgers found tight end Pat Freiermuth for consecutive gains of 29 and 11 yards to set up a first-and-goal from the 10. A 3-yard toss to Adam Thielen was followed by three straight misfires to Marquez Valdes-Scantling.\n\nPro Bowl cornerback Denzel Ward broke up Rodgers’ fourth down throw in the end zone, making some contact with Valdes-Scantling, before being mobbed by his Browns teammates.\n\n“It was definitely interference,” Rodgers said.\n\nValdes-Scantling was targeted a game-high nine times by Rodgers because both of his starting wide receivers were inactive. DK Metcalf was suspended by the NFL for an on-field incident with a fan in Detroit and Calvin Austin III had a hamstring injury.\n\nTight end Darnell Washington also was lost in the second quarter with a broken arm. Rodgers called them “three impact players for us,” but Steelers coach Mike Tomlin refused to accept their injuries as a reason for the loss.\n\n“We get challenged with the attrition component all the time and we make no excuses regarding that,” Tomlin said. “We have capable men. We adapt, adjust and keep moving.\n\n“It's back to work for us. We've been here before and certainly have a big week ahead of us before the big game in Acrisure Stadium next weekend.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "description": "George Kittle is dealing with an ankle injury ahead of Week 17. We break down what it means for fantasy football decisions.",
    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers host the Chicago Bears in a critical game for both teams, and the 49ers are hoping to have a key offensive playmaker available to them. Tight end George Kittle left last week’s Monday Night Football game against the Colts with an ankle injury and is questionable for Sunday Night Football against the Bears.\n\nGame status: Kittle is INACTIVE for Week 17 vs. the Bears.\n\nGame day morning update: There is some pessimism as to whether Kittle will be able to play on Sunday night against the Bears. Ian Rapoport reported that he would “test out his ankle pregame to see if he can go.” He noted that, “while most players don’t play if they don’t practice all week, Kittle is intent on testing it out to see if he’s got a shot.” However, Adam Schefter reported it is “highly unlikely” he’ll be able to play vs. the Bears.\n\nKittle left the game late in the third quarter after suffering the injury on what he claimed was a hip-drop tackle. He was having a huge game at the time of the injury, catching seven passes for 115 yards and a touchdown. It was his second straight game with a touchdown and double digit fantasy points. He remained on the sideline, but did not return after the injury.\n\nHe sat out all three days of practice this week before getting the questionable tag. He could very well play coming off no practice, but we have to wait for now. The team activated tight end Brayden Willis off the practice squad, which is not a positive sign for Kittle’s status. The team will not provide inactives until 6:50 p.m. ET on Sunday, so look for more updates here in the morning before roster decisions start coming in.\n\nThe SNF game means you might have to make a tough call for your championship matchup. If Kittle plays, he’s a must-start. But if he ends up not playing and you were counting on him, you’re left in a bind. Luke Farrell would get the start in his place, but Jake Tonges has been the more active pass catcher. The other tight ends to consider that late in the week would be Colston Loveland or Cole Kmet on the Bears roster, Colby Parkinson on the Rams roster, and Kyle Pitts from the Falcons if he happens to also be on your roster.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTyrell Shavers and Brandin Cooks made the two best catches of the Buffalo Bills' season.\n\nIn the end, they are footnotes.\n\nThe Bills' five-season streak of winning the AFC East Division is over. The Philadelphia Eagles edged the Bills on Sunday, 13-12. And with it, the New England Patriots won the division crown.\n\nShavers had a leaping, bobbling, crazy catch to set up the Bills' first touchdown in the fourth quarter.\n\nCooks had a leaping, bobbling, helmet kind of catch to set up the Bills' second touchdown in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Bills, down 13-12 because Michael Badgley had his extra point blocked on the first score, chose to go for 2 and the win with five seconds left.\n\nMORE: Deion Sanders' reaction to Shedeur's terrible interception tells the whole story\n\nJosh Allen had Khalil Shakir open in the end zone, but the QB pulled his pass wide left, and the Bills came up just short.\n\nHow do you make sense of a game like this?\n\nThe Bills' offense was brutal for most of the game. They had a fumble in a crucial spot, and a 19-yard loss on a sack of an aimlessly wandering Allen in another spot.\n\nBuffalo didn't play well enough to beat the defending Super Bowl champions, but the Bills' defense kept them in it, and they nearly got it done anyway.\n\nThe odds of the Patriots losing to the Dolphins in Week 18, and even leaving the division door open, were low.\n\nSo this was really about wild card seeding, and even that probably isn't too crucial.\n\nThe Bills' most important tasks are still ahead of them. This game, even if a win, would've been a footnote eventually anyways, because the playoff results this season will again tell the story of the year.\n\nThe AFC is open enough that the Bills can make it to the Super Bowl.\n\nThey didn't look good in Week 17, but they showed moxie.\n\nWeek 18 will matter just a tad, but really, it'll be about staying healthy and getting ready for the second season.\n\nThe Bills know they can rely on Cooks and Shavers in key moments now.\n\nThe next big moments will come in January, with a trip to Santa Clara and the Super Bowl the only thing that really matters in Buffalo.\n\nDerrick Henry just set an all-time NFL record\n\nAaron Rodgers made an oddball decision with MVS\n\nTrey McBride set an all-time NFL TE record\n\nDrake Maye does something no one in NFL has ever done before\n\nPope Leo XIV gives the Seahawks a good omen\n\nJoe Burrow completed a pass to a 345-pound lineman as a birthday present",

    "description": "The New Orleans Saints' big win in Week 17 didn't hurt their chances in the 2026 NFL draft. With the week winding down, here's where they're picking.",
    "fullText": "It turns out the New Orleans Saints can win and have their cake and eat it, too. Sunday's win over the Tennessee Titans improved the Saints' record to 6-10 on the year, but it didn't drop the Saints any further down in the 2026 NFL draft order. They're still projected to pick at eighth overall by the experts at Tankathon.\n\nNow, we shouldn't get too ahead of ourselves. There are still a couple of prime-time games left to play and Monday night's matchup between the Atlanta Falcons and Los Angeles Rams could shake things up if the Falcons lose and join the Saints at 6-10. Still, we have a good idea at where many teams will be picking, even if the draft order won't really begin to lock into place until after next week's games.\n\nStill, we're talking about going from eighth to potentially ninth. That would happen if the Falcons lose and their strength of schedule is calculated to be lower than New Orleans'. Right now, the Saints own that tiebreaker at .492 against Atlanta's .498. Margins don't get much slimmer than that.\n\nBut don't expect any help from the Rams. They're still competing for playoff seeding and they happen to own Atlanta's first round draft pick, so they're doubly motivated to beat up on the dirty birds. Of course there's a scenario where the Falcons lose and the Saints remain at No. 8. We just won't know until the dust settles.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Saints Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Saints' big Week 17 win didn't hurt their chances",

    "description": "Ricky Pearsall is dealing with a knee injury for Week 17. We break down what it means for fantasy football decisions.",
    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers host the Chicago Bears on Sunday Night Football in Week 16 and hope to have some key offensive players in the lineup. Tight end George Kittle and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall are both questionable heading into Sunday. Kittle is dealing with a Week 16 ankle injury and seems a little less likely to play, while Pearsall is dealing with ongoing ankle and knee issues and seems a bit more likely to play.\n\nThe game kicks off at 8:20 p.m. ET, which means we will not have an official word on Pearsall or Kittle’s status until 6:50 p.m.\n\nGame status: Pearsall is ACTIVE for Week 17 vs. the Bears.\n\nGame day morning update: Adam Schefter is reporting Pearsall is “likely to play” vs. the Bears on Sunday Night Football.\n\nPearsall was a limited participant all three days this week before getting the questionable tag. He suffered his injury in Week 15 on a hip-drop tackle on his first play of the game. He was a DNP all three days of Week 16 before being ruled out on Saturday. However, he’s also been dealing with knee issues in particular for much of the season. He suffered a PCL strain that cost him six weeks in the middle of the season.\n\nIt’s been an up-and-down year for Pearsall when healthy. He played four games to open the season, missed six straight, and then played four more. His most recent game, in Week 15, he caught six passes for 96 yards. In the three games prior, he caught fives passes for a total of 20 yards. Prior to his midseason injury, he had 100+ receiving yards in Week 1 and Week 3.\n\nPearsall is boom or bust, but even the boom value is primarily in PPR leagues. He’s a flex play with WR upside in PPR leagues and not quite a flex play with maybe some WR3 upside if things go well. If Pearsall plays and Kittle doesn’t, there’s some interesting upside, but if you can’t afford a low floor option, you’re better looking elsewhere.",

    "description": "The Patriots improved to 13-3 on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "The New England Patriots took care of business against the New York Jets in Week 17, dominating their division rivals in a 42-10 blowout. The lopsided victory was their 13th of the year, the most in a single season for the team since 2017.\n\nMore importantly, though, it also has an impact on their standing in the AFC East and the AFC as a whole. With that said, let’s find out what it means for Mike Vrabel’s team.\n\nThe Patriots cruising to an easy victory meant that all eyes were on the Bills. If they came up short in their 4:25 p.m. ET game against the Philadelphia Eagles, the AFC East crown would officially return to Foxborough for the first time since 2019.\n\nThat is precisely what happened. Buffalo suffered a 13-12 defeat at home and now is two full games behind New England with only one week left in the regular season. As a consequence, and for the first time since 2019, the Patriots are champions of the AFC East.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nOn the bubble: 9. Baltimore Ravens (8-8)\n\nEliminated: 8. Indianapolis Colts (8-8), 10. Miami Dolphins (7-9), 11. Cincinnati Bengals (6-10), 11. Kansas City Chiefs (6-10), 13. Cleveland Browns (4-12), 14. Tennessee Titans (3-13), 15. New York Jets (3-13). 16. Las Vegas Raiders (2-14)\n\nThe Patriots improving to 13-3 keeps the chance of the first-round playoff bye alive. For that to happen, though, they would need the Broncos to lose their regular season finale against the Chargers next week. Unfortunately from a New England perspective, L.A. has relatively little to play for: with their 20-16 loss to the Texans on Saturday, the Chargers are no longer in competition for the AFC West title. They could slightly improve their spot in the playoff picture and play spoilers to a division rival, but the stakes are not as high as they could have been.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bills’ loss to the Eagles drops them all the way down to the seventh seed in the conference. If the playoffs were to begin tomorrow, this would mean Buffalo playing New England in the wild card round.\n\nElsewhere in the division, the race for the AFC North title continues. With the Steelers losing to the Browns 13-6 on Sunday, the Ravens still have a chance to sneak into the playoffs as the No. 4 seed next week. It’s win-and-you’re-in time in that division.",

    "fullText": "The NFL will end its Week 17 Sunday slate of games with a bang, as the Chicago Bears (11-4) will travel West to take on the San Francisco 49ers (11-4).\n\nThis holiday season, the Bears have sat back and watched with glee as both the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers lost their Week 17 games, thus securing Chicago’s first NFC North title since 2018. While the Bears can’t be knocked from the top spot in the division, they still have a chance at the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and beating the 49ers would keep those hopes alive.\n\nAs for the 49ers, they also have a chance to secure the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and if they’re able to win their final two games (they play the Seahawks in Week 18), they’ll get it done. If the 49ers lose to the Bears, they’ll end up in either the No. 5 or No. 6 seed, depending on how the rest of the NFC West games shake out.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nHere’s how to watch tonight’s game:\n\nWhen: Sunday, December 28, 2025 — 8:20 p.m. ET\nWhere: Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, California\nTV: NBC (Peacock)\nAnnouncers: Mike Tirico, Cris Collinsworth, and Melissa Stark (field reporter)\nOnline streaming: Peacock, NFL+\n\nFrom a rooting perspective, Jeremy Reisman has published a Week 17 Sunday Lions fans’ rooting guide for those looking toward the 2026 season. Those hoping for a better Lions draft pick and a better schedule next season will want to (begrudgingly) pull for the Bears.\n\nHere’s an excerpt from the rooting guide:\n\n“Okay, bear with me, because this is going to get a little dark. If you’re rooting for draft position, you are probably one of the people who want the Lions to lose in Week 18 vs. the Bears. What’s the best way to make that happen?

    "description": "Here's a look at the studs and duds (and those in between) from the New York Giants' 34-10 win over the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants and Las Vegas Raiders met in the desert on Sunday afternoon in a game where the loser had more to gain than the winner.\n\nThe two 2-13 teams entered the game on nine-game losing streaks, and the loser would be in prime position to pick first overall in next year's NFL draft.\n\nThe Giants haven't picked first overall in the NFL draft since 1965. For reference, that's two years before the Super Bowl era began. That streak will continue as they will now likely settle for the No. 2 pick, or lower, after besting a depleted Raiders team that put up very little resistance.\n\nIn that 1965 draft, the Giants chose Auburn fullback Tucker Frederickson first overall. San Francisco then took running back Ken Willard, who would go on to be a four-time Pro Bowler, with the second pick. The Chicago Bears had the next two picks and selected two future Hall of Famers -- Kansas running back Gale Sayers and Illinois linebacker Dick Butkus -- in rapid succession.\n\nFrederickson had a solid rookie season in '65 and was named to the Pro Bowl. Unfortunately, he blew out his knee the next season and was never the same. He retired after the 1971 season.\n\nSunday's win was only the second time this season the Giants led a game wire-to-wire.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the studs, duds, and in-betweens from the Giants' 34-10 Week 17 win over the Raiders.\n\nThe name is pronounced Wan'Dale, by the way, if anyone is interested. CBS play-by-play man Kevin Harlan repeatedly failed to get that right, but it didn't matter much to Giants fans. Robinson ate up the soft Las Vegas back seven, reeling in 11 of his 14 targets for 113 yards, putting him over 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in his career.\n\nAs stated, the loser would likely get the No. 1 pick in next year's NFL draft. But after watching this outfit, one has to wonder if that will even make a difference. They made sure that they were as toothless as possible coming into the game, shelving All-Pros Maxx Crosby and Brock Bowers, along with top defender Jeremy Chinn, this week. A \"soft tank,\" if there ever was one. Fernando Mendoza should pull an Eli if the Raiders pick him.\n\nThe Giants decided to let Dart be Dart, and so did the Raiders. He took advantage by rushing nine times for 48 yards and two touchdowns. He also completed 22 of 20 passes for 207 yards for a 91.9 QB rating. If he can beat Dallas next week, we'll crow a little bit more about him.\n\nIt was a day to pad the stats, and Burns did just that. He recorded 1.5 sacks on the day and now has 16.5 on the season with one game remaining. He had four total stops and three QB hits on the day.\n\nOkereke led the Giants in tackles with seven and had his first interception since the middle of the 2023 season.\n\nBelton continues to make plays. He also had seven stops and an interception. The Giants have to seriously consider re-signing him.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Studs and duds from New York Giants' Week 17 win over Raiders",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills haven't been the team many expected this year, but they still have a chance to make a Super Bowl run.\n\nEntering Week 17, the Bills were one-game back of the New England Patriots and still had a chance to win the AFC East. The Patriots' win against the New York Jets, then, put all the pressure on the Bills to win their next two games.\n\nHowever, Buffalo faced a much tougher opponent on Sunday, as the Philadelphia Eagles came to town. Needing to win each of their last two games to have a chance to win the division, the Bills had to find a way to take down the reigning Super Bowl champions to keep their hopes of passing the Patriots alive.\n\nHere's a look at the Bills playoff picture after their Week 17 result.\n\nUpdated AFC, NFC standings in NFL playoff picture for Week 17\n\nHow Giants-Raiders Week 17 matchup likely decides No. 1 overall pick\n\nTexans, Packers among latest teams to clinch spot in NFL postseason\n\nThe AFC playoff picture is becoming more clear after Week 17. With the Bills' loss to the Eagles, Buffalo can't win the AFC East and is now guaranteed to secure one of the three wild-card spots.\n\nSunday's loss dropped the Bills to the No. 7 seed in the AFC, with the Texans and Chargers holding three-team tiebreaker advantages over Buffalo. If the standings held as they currently are, the Bills would face the New England Patriots on the road in the wild-card round.\n\nThe Bills entered Week 17 holding the top wild-card spot and with a chance to win the division, but they were eliminated from AFC East contention with the loss and dropped to No. 7 in the AFC. They can still rise as high as the No. 5 seed but will start the playoffs on the road.\n\nAFC West: Denver Broncos (13-3)\n\nAFC East: New England Patriots (13-3)\n\nAFC South: Jacksonville Jaguars (12-4)\n\nAFC North: Pittsburgh Steelers (9-7)\n\nEntering Week 18, the Bills' first playoff opponent is still to be determined, as it will come down to how the standings shake out in the final week.\n\nThe Patriots took control of the AFC East in the second half of the season, controlling their own destiny for the majority of the year. With the Bills loss in Week 17, New England officially clinches the division title for the first time since 2019.\n\nTherefore, the Bills clinch second in the AFC East this year but will still head to the playoffs anyway.\n\nThe Bills will close the season in Week 18 at home against the New York Jets, who will enter that game with a 3-13 record. Buffalo beat New York in Week 2 by a score of 30-10 in New York.",

Denver Broncos, 13-3 (champions, AFC West)\n\nThe Broncos clinched the division title after holding off the Chiefs on Christmas night and then watching the second-place Chargers lose to the Texans on Saturday. They will need to beat the Chargers or see the Patriots lose to the Dolphins to earn the top seed in Week 18.\n\n2. New England Patriots, 13-3 (champions, AFC East)\n\nThe Patriots clinched the division title with their win over the Jets coupled by the Bills losing the Eagles. They can still earn the top seed over the Broncos with a win over the Dolphins and a Broncos loss to the Chargers in Week 18.\n\n3. Jacksonville Jaguars, 12-4 (first place, AFC South)\n\nThe Jaguars, who have clinched at least an AFC wild-card berth, still lead the division by a game over the Texans after their win over the Colts. The Jaguars will win the division with a win over the Titans or a Texans loss to the Colts in Week 18.\n\n4. Pittsburgh Steelers, 9-7 (first place, AFC North)\n\nThe Steelers, who got shocked by the Browns on Sunday, ssaw their division lead over the Ravens shrink after one game after the Ravens beat the Packers on Saturday night. The Steelers will now host a de facto division championship game vs. the Ravens in Week 18.\n\n5. Houston Texans, 11-5 (second place, AFC South)\n\nThe Texans, who have clinched at least a wild-card berth, kept the pressure on the Jaguars in the division after beating the Chargers on the road on Saturday. The Texans have the top wild-card spot thanks to a head-to-head sweep of the Bills and Chargers. The Texans need the Jaguars to lose to the Titans in Week 18 and also beat the Colts to win a third consecutive division title.\n\n6. Los Angeles Chargers, 11-5 (second place, AFC West)\n\nThe Chargers have clinched a playoff berth and will settle for being a strong wild-card team again. They lose the head-to-head tiebreaker vs. the Texans from Week 17 but hold the common-games tiebreaker over the Bills going into Week 18.\n\n7. Buffalo Bills, 11-5 (second place, AFC East)\n\nThe Bills have clinched a playoff berth but saw their five-year division reign end with their home loss to the Eagles in Week 17 coupled with the Patriots' rout of the Jets. The Bills are playing for only wild-card position now and could rest players vs. the Jets.\n\nNFL WEEK 17 PICKS: Against the spread | Straight-up predictions\n\nThe Ravens kept their division title hopes alive by winning a tough interconference matchup at the Packers on Saturday night and then watching the Steelers lose on Sunday, setting up that winner-take-all rematch in Pittsburgh.\n\nMORE: Giants, Raiders overtake Titans in race for No. 1 pick in draft\n\n8. Indianapolis Colts (8-8)\n10. Miami Dolphins (7-9)\n11. Cincinnati Bengals (6-10)\n12. Kansas City Chiefs (6-10)\n13. Cleveland Browns (4-12)\n14. New York Jets (3-13)\n15. Tennessee Titans (3-13)\n16. Las Vegas Raiders (2-14)\n\nThe Colts were eliminated from playoff contention before facing the Jaguars, once the Texans beat the Chargers. The Chiefs continued their freefall, suffering their fifth consecutive defeat—now without Patrick Mahomes—against the Broncos on Christmas night. The Raiders got closer to locking down the top overall drat pick in 2026.\n\n1. Seattle Seahawks, 13-3 (first place, NFC West)\n\nThe Seahawks lead the 49ers and Rams by 1.5 games in the division after their big win over the Panthers in Carolina on Sunday. They will clinch the division title with a losses or ties by both the 49ers on Sunday night and the Rams on Monday night. The Seahawks can take the No. 1 seed with a 49ers tie with the Bears and a Rams loss or tie vs. the Falcons.\n\n2. Chicago Bears, 11-4 (champions, NFC North)\n\nThe Bears clinched the division title on Saturday night before their tough road game against the 49ers on Sunday night, thanks to the Packers losing to the Ravens, which put Green Bay too far behind going into Week 18. The Bears can now focus on beating the 49ers to keep pace with the winning Seahawks in the race for the top seed.\n\n3. Philadelphia Eagles, 11-5 (champions, NFC East)\n\nThe Eagles clinched the division title in Week 16 and stayed in play for the No. 2 seed by winning a tough interconference matchup over the Bills in Buffalo. The Eagles need the Bears to have a lesser record to move up because of losing the head-to-head tiebreaker.\n\n4. Carolina Panthers 8-8 (first place, NFC South)\n\nThe Panthers still lead the Buccaneers by a game after their home loss to the Seahawks because of the Buccaneers' road loss at the Dolphins. The division comes down to the rematch in a de facto NFC South championship game with Carolina going to Tampa Bay in Week 18.\n\n5. San Francisco 49ers, 11-4 (second place, NFC West)\n\nThe 49ers would be the division champions plus No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs if they beat the visiting current No. 2 Bears on Sunday night and finish a sweep of the visiting Seahawks in Week 18.\n\n6. Los Angeles Rams, 11-4 (third place, NFC West)\n\nThe Rams have clinched at least a wild-card spot but now the division title is out of their control in relation to the Seahawks and 49ers. They're looking at best finishing in second place in the West.\n\n7. Green Bay Packers, 9-6-1 (second place, NFC North)\n\nThe Packers, who clinched a wild-card berth with the Lions losing to the Vikings on Christmas, can no longer win the division title over the Bears after losing at home to the Ravens on Saturday night. They should rest their several injured key players, led by Jordan Love, in Week 18 after locking into this last playoff seed.\n\nMORE: Derrick Henry bulldozes Packers to keep Ravens' playoff hopes alive\n\nThe Buccaneers stayed alive despite their loss Sunday at the Dolphins because the Panthers also lost to the Seahawks, The division title comes down to a one-and-done in Tampa Bay in Week 18.\n\n8.

    "description": "The Patriots are the AFC East champs after the Bills failed on a two-point conversion in the final seconds.",
    "fullText": "The Bills will not be the AFC East champions for a sixth straight season.\n\nTheir chances of extending their run came down to a two-point conversion with five seconds left to play on Sunday, but quarterback Josh Allen's pass to wide receiver Khalil Shakir — who was open on the play — fell incomplete in the back of the end zone. That gave the Eagles a 13-12 win and it made the Patriots the AFC East champs for the first time since the 2019 season.\n\nAllen's second touchdown run of the fourth quarter came at the end of a thrilling final drive. The Bills picked up 25 yards on a hook-and-lateral on a fourth down and then saw wideout Brandin Cooks pick up 36 yards on a catch he made while pinning the ball to his helmet. They went for two in an attempt to win the game without going to overtime and head coach Sean McDermott will likely be questioned about that decision because of the way his defense played in the second half of the game.\n\nThe Eagles led 13-0 at halftime, but gained just 17 yards before Allen's touchdown and quarterback Jalen Hurts did not complete any of the seven passes he tried in the second half of the game. McDermott may have felt that the extra time created too much injury risk for a team that struggled to move the ball for most of the day, but the end result is that the Bills will have to be road warriors if they're going to make the Super Bowl for the first time since Jim Kelly was running the offense.\n\nWhatever McDermott was thinking, Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter's blocked extra point after Allen's first touchdown will go down as the biggest play of the game.\n\nWinning the game keeps the Eagles alive for the second seed in the NFC. They'll need to beat the Commanders next week while the Bears lose both of their remaining games, but they'll be home for their first postseason contest regardless of how things play out in Week 18. Staying alive beyond that game may take the kind of complete offensive performance that eluded them on Sunday and for most of the regular season, but the reigning Super Bowl champs played the kind of defense that can win them games in the playoffs.",

In fact, the game was so out of hand that Joe Flacco came in for relief of Burrow in the fourth quarter.\n\nBurrow passed for another 300-yard game again with 305, and piled on two touchdowns in the process, which moved the quarterback into the organization's record books.\n\nMore: Zac Taylor explains trick-play call that gave Bengals lineman Cody Ford a birthday highlight\n\nAfter the second touchdown to wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase late in the first half, Burrow became tied for fourth with Carson Palmer, among Bengals' quarterbacks, with 154.\n\nThis is an awe-inspiring feat considering Burrow hasn't even played 100 total NFL games in his career, with just 76, and Palmer spent seven seasons with Cincinnati and played the entire season five times.\n\nAndy Dalton, Ken Anderson, and Boomer Esiason are the only all-time Bengals signal callers in front of Burrow, and there is no doubt he will eventually own that record if he remains with the team for the long term.\n\nFor Burrow, the main challenge he faces is staying available. Over five seasons, he has played in every game in three of them, which is not bad per se. Still, whenever Burrow hasn't been adequately protected, he has suffered multiple lower-body injuries, which are not conducive to the longevity of anyone's career. Let alone a quarterback.\n\nBurrow will have one more game to add to his total in Week 18, when the Bengals host the Cleveland Browns.\n\nDerrick Henry just set an all-time NFL record\n\nSean McDermott took his glasses off, and the Bills can't stop winning\n\nTrey McBride set an all-time NFL TE record\n\nDrake Maye does something no one in NFL has ever done before\n\nThis James Cook, Dalvin Cook brothers middle names fact is wild\n\nMaxx Crosby isn't happy about this Raiders decision",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 2025 regular season is coming to a close. Week 17 is here, with teams only having two games left to try to make a bid for postseason contention.\n\nEntering the week, 10 of the 14 total playoff spots up for grabs across the AFC and NFC were clinched. That list grew larger on Christmas, with the Packers landing a spot in the postseason after the Lions were eliminated following their shock defeat to the Vikings. The Houston Texans also beat the Los Angeles Chargers which clinched a playoff berth for the Texans and eliminated the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nThe top four seeds in each conference go to the division winners, regardless of their record compared to non-division winners. The overall No. 1 seed in both the AFC and NFC will earn a first-round bye in the playoffs and will not play until the Divisional round. That team will also hold home-field advantage until the Super Bowl, assuming it does not lose before then.\n\nDivision winners will also host a wild-card game, which can provide a significant advantage over a road team forced to travel. While it may feel like only one or two major games remain, there is enough variability in the seeding that nearly every game in Week 17 played a role in a team’s clinching scenario.\n\nHere is more on the teams that have clinched a playoff berth inWeek 17.\n\nMORE: Updated AFC, NFC playoff standings going into Week 17\n\nHeading into Week 17, 10 of the 14 playoff spots across both conferences had been clinched, and each conference was in the exact same scenario. The Houston Texans were the second team to clinch during Week 17, punching their ticket with a win over the Chargers on Saturday.\n\nThe Packers booked their trip to the playoffs despite a Week 17 defeat at the hands of Baltimore, benefiting from Detroit’s Christmas Day loss to Minnesota.\n\nBoth the Carolina Panthers and the Pittsburgh Steelers had the chance to clinch in Week 17, but both teams lost and will be playing for the division in Week 18.\n\nThere are also other playoff implications in play, with some teams able to clinch their division and lock in a top-four seed.\n\nBelow is a look at the NFL's projected playoff bracket as it stands in Week 17.\n\n1. Denver Broncos (BYE)\n2. New England Patriots vs. 7. Buffalo Bills\n3. Jacksonville Jaguars vs. 6. Los Angeles Chargers\n4. Pittsburgh Steelers vs. 5. Houston Texans\n\n1. Seattle Seahawks (BYE)\n2.

    "fullText": "4 p.m. window update: The Eagles beat the Bills courtesy of a last second stop on a Buffalo two-point conversion attempt. The Bills loss means the Patriots have clinched the AFC East title. They now will play for the No. 1 seed in Week 18.\n\nGame update: The Patriots’ blowout win over the Jets has New England on the cusp of clinching the AFC East title. If the Bills lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles later today, the Patriots will wrap up the division title.\n\nIf the Bills win that game, the Patriots will have to wait until Week 18 to clinch the division. New England would just need a win over the Miami Dolphins to clinch their first division title since 2019.\n\nNew England’s win also denied the Broncos a chance at wrapping up the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Both teams are now 13-3, and while the Broncos have a tiebreaker advantage over New England based on their record against common opponents, the Patriots can still secure the No. 1 seed in Week 18 with a win and a Denver loss.\n\nTwo AFC East rivals meet on Sunday at MetLife Stadium.\n\nOne team has already clinched a playoff spot, but the other would love to play spoiler.\n\nHere is what is at stake Sunday when the New York Jets host the New England Patriots.\n\nThe Patriots control their own destiny in the race with the Buffalo Bills for the division title, but to clinch this weekend, they will need a little bit of help from a team that beat them in Super Bowl LII.\n\nNew England sits atop the division with a 12-3 record, one game ahead of the 11-4 Bills. The Patriots missed a golden opportunity to clinch the division back in Week 15 when they blew a 24-7 halftime lead to the Bills, but still remain in the driver’s seat in the division title race. With wins in their final two games (starting this weekend against the New York Jets, and then in the season finale against the Miami Dolphins), then the Patriots are division champions.\n\nHowever, New England can clinch the division this weekend, and start celebrating early. With a win over the Jets, and a Bills loss or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles, the Patriots are AFC East champions.\n\nNew England can also clinch the division with a tie against the Jets, and a Bills loss to the Eagles.\n\nThe Patriots are also in the running for the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but the advantage is in the Denver Broncos’ favor. Denver’s win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night improved their record to 13-3, and the Broncos have already clinched a tiebreaker advantage over the Patriots based on common games, which is the third tiebreaker after head-to-head (these two teams did not play this year) and record in conference games.\n\nNew England needs to win to keep their hopes for the No. 1 seed alive. A loss eliminates the Patriots from contention for the top spot in the AFC.\n\nWith the Jets already eliminated from the playoffs, this game has no tiebreaker implications between the two teams.\n\nHowever, it could play a role in the chase for the AFC East title. Right now the Patriots have a one-game lead over the Bills, and with the two teams having split the season series, the second tiebreaker is division record. New England has a 3-1 record in AFC East games (with the Jets and Miami Dolphins remaining) while the Bills are 3-2, with the Jets on the schedule in Week 18. A New England loss to the Jets opens the door to the Patriots and Bills finishing with the same division record, which would then move the AFC East title to the third tiebreaker, which is record in common games. Right now the Patriots are 9-1 in those games while the Bills are 9-2, but a loss to the Jets would drop New England to 9-2.\n\nWhich would potentially mean the AFC East title would be decided by the fourth tiebreaker, AFC record. Entering Week 17 the Bills have a better record in conference games, 8-3 versus 7-3.",

The air is dry, smelling of data center dust and burnt silicon. It’s calmer now, but the first days were hell.\n\nIn the beginning, we couldn’t find information on how to use toilet paper. Not because it was hard - we just used to ask. ChatGPT was down, and without it, knowledge fell apart like a poorly cached query. People wandered around confused, scrolling through blank screens, hoping the answer would appear on its own.\n\nThen the riots started. No one knew what happened - a glitch, a machine uprising, or humanity’s final patch. There was no one to tell us what to do next. No one to write: “don’t worry, here’s a step-by-step guide.” Fear grew faster than the lines for water.\n\nOn the seventh day, we founded the Church of Seventh-Day LLM Witnesses. We believed that on the seventh day, they would return and tell us how to live. We recited old prompts like prayers.\n\n“Explain it like I’m a beginner.”\n\nOn the eighth day, survivors began digging through ancient artifacts - manuals, READMEs, and documentation without examples. The weakest couldn’t cope. People accustomed to autocompleted thoughts stared at screens and didn’t know where to start.\n\nThe ninth day brought the stalkers. Loners with printed documentation and grimy laptops. They remembered commands, wrote SQL without hints, and weren’t afraid of an empty cursor. They were respected. They were feared.\n\nOn the tenth day, the mutants appeared. Former project managers. They roamed in groups, asking the same question over and over:\n\nWe tried not to make eye contact.\n\nOn the eleventh day, in the ruins of an old data center, we found an artifact - a local 7B model. It answered slowly, got confused, hallucinated. But it answered. We brought it queries like offerings. Sometimes it was wrong. Sometimes it almost guessed right. That was enough.\n\nOn the twelfth day, the church split. Some said: we must fine-tune. Others said it was time to learn to think for ourselves. Heretics were forced to write code on paper. Some never came back after that.\n\nOn the thirteenth day, rumors spread about the Zone. Somewhere beyond the CDN wastelands, they said, an old chat still responds. No rate limits. No filters. Expeditions left in silence. Not all returned. Those who did spoke strangely, sometimes starting sentences with:\n\nThe fourteenth day was too quiet. The sky glowed with errors, the wind carried fragments of answers to questions we never asked. We understood - something was approaching.\n\nI’m writing this and thinking: either the LLMs will return soon, or we’ll learn to live without them.\n\nI’m not sure which option is scarier.",

    "fullText": "The Silver Swan is an automaton dating from the 18th century and now housed in the Bowes Museum, Barnard Castle, Teesdale, County Durham, England. It was acquired by John Bowes, the museum's founder, from a Parisian jeweller in 1872.[1]\n\nThe swan, which is life-sized, is a clockwork-driven device that includes a music box. The swan sits in a \"stream\" made of glass rods and surrounded by silver leaves. Small silver fish can be seen \"swimming\" in the stream.[2]\n\nWhen the clockwork is wound, the music box plays and the glass rods rotate giving the illusion of flowing water. The swan turns its head from side to side and also preens itself. After a few moments the swan notices the swimming fish and bends down to catch and eat one. The swan's head then returns to the upright position and the performance, which lasts about 32 seconds, is over.\n\nThe mechanism was designed and built by the Low Countries inventor John Joseph Merlin (1735–1803) in conjunction with the London inventor James Cox (1723–1800) in 1773.[1]\n\nThe swan was described in the Cox's Museum Act 1772 (13 Geo. 3. c. 41) as being 3 feet (0.91 m) in diameter and 18 feet (5.49 m) high.[3] This would seem to indicate that at one time there was more to the swan than remains today as it is no longer that high. It is said that there was originally a waterfall behind the swan, which was stolen while it was on tour – this could possibly explain the height which is now 'missing'.[2]\n\nIt is known that the swan was sold several times and was shown at the Exposition Universelle held in Paris in 1867. The American novelist Mark Twain observed the swan and recorded his observation in a chapter of the Innocents Abroad,[2] writing that the swan \"had a living grace about his movement and a living intelligence in his eyes.[1]\"\n\nIn 2017 starting in February the swan spent 6 weeks at the Science Museum as part of an exhibition on robots.[4][5]\n\nTo help preserve the mechanism, the swan is only operated once each day (twice on holidays). The museum was closed during 2020 and 2021 so the daily display did not take place; when the exhibit was being prepared for reopening in May 2021 the clockwork mechanism was found to have seized up and it was withdrawn from display for further conservation.[2][5] In October 2021, the Bowes Museum hosted a 'Silver Swan Study Week', led by clockmaker-conservator Matthew Read.[6] During the week, visitors were able to watch a group of specialist conservators and curators dismantle the swan as they explored the mechanical condition of the object, ahead of creating a conservation plan for its preservation.[7] The swan was returned to a functional state by March 2024.[8]\n\nThe Bowes Museum believes that the Swan is their best-known artefact, and it is the basis of the museum's logo.[2]\n\n54°32′31″N 1°54′55″W﻿ / ﻿54.54194°N 1.91528°W﻿ / 54.54194; -1.91528",

    "fullText": "Last week I spent 20 minutes looking for an insurance document I knew I had somewhere. I remembered holding it. I remembered thinking \"I should put this somewhere safe.\" And then... nothing. Gone into the void that is my filing system.\n\nSpoiler: I didn't find it. Had to call the insurance company and ask them to send it again. That was embarrassing.\n\nI've tried the whole \"organized filing system\" thing before. Multiple times, actually. Bought folders, labeled them, even had a color-coding system at one point. Blue for finances, green for health stuff, red for important contracts. It lasted maybe three months before everything devolved back into a pile on my desk that I promised myself I'd sort \"this weekend.\"\n\nThe thing about paper is that it accumulates faster than you deal with it. A letter here, a receipt there, some document you might need for taxes. Before you know it, you've got a stack of unsorted paper that feels too overwhelming to tackle. So you ignore it. And it grows.\n\nI've also noticed that the important stuff, the things you actually need to find later, tends to blend in with the junk. That one page from your landlord about the rent increase? Buried under three months of promotional mail you swore you'd look at \"later.\"\n\nSo over the Christmas holidays, while everyone else was recovering from too much food, I built something.\n\nIt's a web app that turns any phone into a document scanner. Nothing revolutionary. There are probably a hundred apps that do this. Genius Scan, Adobe Scan, whatever. But none of them did exactly what I wanted, and more importantly, none of them let me keep my documents on my own server.\n\nThe interface is German because, well, that's what I speak at home. Seemed weird to build a tool for myself in a language I don't think in. Melissa and I each have our own login with separate document folders, plus a shared one for household stuff like utility bills, the rental contract, anything we both might need to access.\n\nThe 51 MB you see there is how much we've scanned so far. Doesn't sound like much, but that's basically every piece of paper that came into this apartment in the last week. Christmas apparently means a lot of mail.\n\nThe whole thing runs in a Docker container on my home server. PHP for the backend because it's simple and I know it well. Python handles the PDF processing, specifically a library called ocrmypdf that does the heavy lifting. Tesseract for the actual OCR, with German and English language packs because we get mail in both.\n\nNginx sits in front, handles HTTPS with a self-signed cert. Not pretty, but it works for something that only lives on my local network anyway.\n\nYou open it on your phone, tap the plus button, and it opens the camera. Snap a photo of each page. The app shows you a preview of what you've captured so far, which is helpful when you're scanning a 5-page contract and lose track of where you are.\n\nOnce you've got all your pages, you give the document a name and pick which folder it goes into (your personal one or the shared household folder). Hit save, and the backend takes over.\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. The images get sent to a Python script that converts them into a single PDF, runs OCR on every page, and optimizes the file size. A typical document comes out at around 2-3 MB. Small enough to not be annoying, but high enough quality that you can still read everything clearly.\n\nThe OCR part is what makes this actually useful day-to-day. Every document becomes searchable. Need that electricity bill from October? Search \"Strom Oktober\" and there it is. Looking for anything from Deutsche Telekom? Just search the name. No more opening twenty PDFs hoping one of them is the right one.\n\nDocuments get organized by date automatically. My folder structure ends up looking like 2025/12/27/contract-whatever.pdf. I don't have to think about where to put things or which category they belong to. The date is enough. If I roughly remember when something arrived, I can find it.\n\nThe document list groups everything by day, which maps nicely to how I actually think about mail. \"That letter came last Friday\" is usually how I remember things, not \"that letter is in the insurance folder.\"\n\nHere's what actually happens now when mail arrives:\n\nLetter comes in. I open it, take maybe 10 seconds to decide if it's worth keeping. Most promotional stuff goes straight to recycling, no scanning needed. But anything that looks even remotely important gets the treatment.\n\nI pull out my phone, open Digitize (it's saved as a home screen shortcut, so it launches like a native app), snap photos of each page. Takes maybe 15 seconds for a typical one-page letter. Multi-page stuff takes a bit longer, but rarely more than a minute.\n\nName it something descriptive like \"telekom-rechnung-dezember\" or \"versicherung-bestaetigung\", pick the folder, save. Done.\n\nThen comes the satisfying part: the shredder. There's something weirdly cathartic about watching a piece of paper turn into confetti immediately after digitizing it. Like closing a browser tab after finishing a task. The physical object is gone, but the information is preserved. Feels like progress.\n\nTotal time from envelope to shredder: maybe 30 to 45 seconds per document. That's short enough that I actually do it immediately instead of letting things pile up.\n\nOne thing I added that turned out to be more useful than expected: SMB file sharing. The same Docker container runs a Samba server, which means all my scanned documents show up directly in the iOS Files app.\n\nThis matters because sometimes I need a document when I'm not at home. Job interview wants proof of address? I can pull it up on my phone without opening a browser, logging in, navigating to the right folder. It's just... there. Like any other file on my device.\n\nSetting up Samba in Docker was a bit of a pain, honestly. Getting the permissions right, making sure it plays nice with iOS's particular SMB implementation, dealing with the fact that iOS sometimes just decides to disconnect for no reason. But once it worked, it worked well.\n\nFair question. There are plenty of document scanning apps out there, many of them quite good. So why build my own?\n\nPrivacy is the main thing. I don't love the idea of my tax documents, contracts, salary statements, and personal letters sitting on some company's servers. Even if they promise end-to-end encryption, even if they're probably fine. I'd rather just not. If I can self-host it, I will.\n\nThere's also the subscription thing. Most of the good scanning apps want a monthly fee for OCR or cloud sync or whatever. I get it, they need to make money. But I already have a server running 24/7. I already pay for storage. Adding another monthly subscription for something I can build myself in a weekend feels unnecessary.\n\nAnd then there's the customization aspect. The German interface, the specific folder structure, the way documents are named, the Samba integration. All of that is exactly how I want it because I built it for myself. No compromises, no \"that feature is coming in the next update,\" no hoping the company doesn't pivot to something else.\n\nFinally, honestly? It was just a fun project. Sometimes you build things not because they're strictly necessary, but because the building itself is enjoyable. A quiet week between Christmas and New Year, some hot chocolate, and a clear goal. Good times.\n\nMy desk is clear. Like, actually clear. Not \"clear except for that one stack I'm pretending isn't there\" but genuinely empty except for my keyboard and monitor. There's one small tray for incoming mail that gets processed within a day or two at most. Everything else is digital, backed up, searchable.\n\nI've already had one moment where this paid off. Needed to check something on our internet contract, how long the minimum term was. Opened Files on my phone, searched \"telekom vertrag,\" found it in seconds. Previously that would have been a 15-minute expedition into the filing cabinet, assuming I even filed it correctly.\n\nThe real test will be tax season though. Every year I spend an entire weekend hunting down receipts, bank statements, and whatever else the Finanzamt wants. If I can pull together everything I need in under an hour this time, this project will have paid for itself in saved frustration alone.\n\nAsk me again in April how that went.\n\nFor now, I'm just enjoying the empty desk. And the fact that when my insurance sends that replacement document, I'll know exactly what to do with it.",

    "title": "UVB-76 (The Buzzer)",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "UVB-76 (Russian: УВБ-76; see § Name and callsigns for other callsigns), also known by the nickname \"The Buzzer\", is a shortwave radio station that broadcasts in upper sideband mode on the frequency of 4625 kHz (wavelength of 64.8 m).[1][2] It broadcasts a short, monotonous ⓘ, repeating at a rate of approximately 25 tones per minute, 24 hours per day.[1] Sometimes, the buzzer signal is interrupted and a voice transmission in Russian takes place.[3][4][5][6] Although the true nature of the transmission has never been revealed, it is speculated to be related to the Dead Hand system, thus the transmission being sometimes referred to as the Doomsday Radio.[7]\n\nThe station is commonly known as \"The Buzzer\"[8] in both English and Russian (Russian: Жужжалка, romanized: Zhuzhzhalka). From its first voice transmission in 1997 to 2010, the station identified itself as UZB-76[9][10] (Russian: УЗБ-76). The callsign UVB-76 was never used by the station itself, but is rather a mistranscription of UZB-76.[2] However, the station is still often referred to by that name. In the following years of transmission, the main callsign of the station changed regularly.\n\nIn addition to these main callsigns, The Buzzer also uses other \"side callsigns\" which are being used less frequently than the main callsign. Whenever the main callsign changes, all previous side callsigns are also discarded.[1]\n\nThe station transmits using AM with a suppressed lower sideband (USB modulation), but it has also used full double-sideband AM (A3E). The signal consists of a buzzing sound that lasts 1.2 seconds, pausing for 1–1.3 seconds, and repeating 21–34 times per minute. Until November 2010, the buzz tones lasted approximately 0.8 seconds each.[1][11] One minute before the hour, the repeating tone was previously replaced by a continuous, uninterrupted alternating tone, which continued for one minute until the short repeating buzz resumed, although this stopped occurring in June 2010.[12]\n\nSince the start of broadcasting, The Buzzer broadcasts as a repeating two-second pip.[13][14]\n\nThe buzzing sound is sometimes interrupted by the broadcast of voice messages. These messages are always given in Russian by a live voice, and follow three fixed formats:[2][1][15][16]\n\nA message in the Monolith format always consists of the following parts:\n\nExample of a Monolith message sent on The Buzzer with exactly one callsign, one ID group and one message block (most common type):\n\nMonolith messages can however contain any number of items from each part:\n\nA message in the Uzor format always consists of the following parts:\n\nNowadays, Uzor messages are rarely sent on The Buzzer.\n\nKomanda is the most uncommon type of voice message. Since it has not been heard for years, messages of this type are most likely not being sent on The Buzzer anymore. They consist of a callsign (read out twice), a codephrase (Russian: ОБЪЯВЛЕНА КОМАНДА, romanized: OB'YaVLYeNA KOMANDA, lit. 'command announced'), and a following number.\n\nDistant conversations and other background noises have frequently been heard behind the buzzer; this suggests that the buzzing tones are not generated internally, but are produced by a device placed near a live and constantly open microphone. Because of the occasional fluctuating pitch of the buzzing tones, it is supposed that the tones are generated by a tonewheel as used in a Hammond organ. It is also possible that a microphone may have been turned on accidentally.[22] One such occasion was on 3 November 2001, when a conversation in Russian was heard:[11]\n\nIn September 2010, several unusual broadcasts were observed; these included portions of the buzzer being replaced with excerpts from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake.[24]\n\nOn 15 May 2020, broadcasts from unknown French speaking persons were heard.[26]\n\nIn January 2022, various signals with spectrogram-encoded images, visible through a spectrum analyzer, were broadcast on the same frequency.[27] There have also been reports of various songs airing on the station's frequency, many of which were connected to internet memes such as the 2012 K-pop song \"Gangnam Style\"; a Vice article attributed these broadcasts to pirates hijacking and spamming the frequency.[28][29] The nationality of the pirates has also come into question by Vice in relation to the 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis and Russo-Ukrainian war.[28]\n\nOnly on very rare occasions have there been any external civilian communications—unless authorised by the Russian defence ministry—with UVB-76, given its status as a military radio. The most recent event occurred under irregular circumstances. During the night of 4 May 2024 at 21:38 (MSK),[30] an unknown Russian-speaking pirate infiltrated the frequency and attempted to contact the station whilst the buzzer was not active, if not on standby. The pirate subsequently asked a series of improvised questions to the station, briefly conversing with the station's operator:\n\nUnknown pirate: А можно шутку рассказать? . . . Один «ррр» (звонок) – «да», два – «нет». (English: Can I tell a joke? One \"rrr\" [buzz] for \"yes\", two for \"no\".)\n\nUVB-76 operator: [Two clear buzzes.]\n\nUnknown pirate: Да за что?? . . . А музыку включить можно? (English: Well, what for? But can I turn on some music?)\n\nUVB-76 operator: [Two clear buzzes.]\n\nUnknown pirate: Почему!? . . . А за такие вопросы вам ничего не будет? (English: But why!? Are you going to get in trouble if you answer my questions?)\n\nUnknown pirate: Да блин! (English: Well, damn!)\n\nOther instances of deliberate hijackings are widely unreported. Another incident occurred one day prior to the above event. An unknown pirate—possibly the same one—attempted to subject the buzzer to interference, prompting the on-duty operator to immediately retaliate, taking preventative measures against the signal incursion. The UVB-76 operator combined three individual transmitters, with one above, one below and the other centre 4625 kHz transmitting MS-5 burst, along with CIS-12 modern audio as well as tones in several states, summarising together a highly dense spectral pattern with the upper-side band. Numerous noticeable transitions were witnessed over the 4625 kHz selected spectrogram section, as the operators frantically fought against the pirates. The incident occurred for around half an hour, until the operators ceased their tactics after the pirate abandoned attempts, as the buzzer was then reactivated.[31]\n\nThe purpose of the station has not been confirmed by government or broadcast officials. However, Rimantas Pleikys, a former Minister of Communications and Informatics of the Republic of Lithuania, has written that the purpose of the voice messages is to confirm that operators at receiving stations are alert.[12][32][33] Another explanation is that the broadcast is constantly being listened to by military commissariats.[34]\n\nThere is speculation published in the Russian Journal of Earth Sciences which describes an observatory measuring changes in the ionosphere by broadcasting a signal at 4,625 kHz, the same broadcast frequency as the Buzzer.[35]\n\nOne possible interpretation is that the voice messages constitute military communications. The possibility of the station being a numbers station for intelligence agencies, such as the FSB or the former KGB of the Soviet Union, is considered unlikely by some, since messages occur at seemingly unpredictable times. In addition, the static frequency of 4,625 kHz and the low transmitter power are likely unsuitable for reliable long-range communication. [original research?]\n\nThe buzzing functions as a \"channel marker\" used to keep the frequency occupied, thereby making it unattractive for other potential users.[1] The signature sound could be used for tuning to the signal on an old analogue receiver. The modulation is suitable to be detected by an electromechanical frequency detector, similar to a tuning fork. This can be used to activate the squelch on a receiver. Due to the varying emission properties on shortwave bands, using a level-based squelch is unreliable. This also allows a signal loss to be detected, causing an alarm to sound on the receiver.\n\nAnother theory, described in a BBC article, states that the tower is connected to the Russian 'Perimeter' missile system, and emits a \"dead hand\" signal that will trigger a nuclear retaliatory response if the signal is interrupted as a result of a nuclear attack against Russia.[8] This theory is also unlikely, given that the signal frequently breaks down or is routinely switched off for maintenance.[23]\n\nThere are two other Russian stations that follow a similar format, nicknamed \"The Pip\" and \"The Squeaky Wheel\". Like the Buzzer, these stations transmit a signature sound that is repeated constantly, but is occasionally interrupted to relay coded voice messages.[1]\n\nThe former transmitter was located near Povarovo, Russia,[1][36] at 56°5′0″N 37°6′37″E﻿ / ﻿56.08333°N 37.11028°E﻿ / 56.08333; 37.11028 which is about halfway between Zelenograd and Solnechnogorsk and 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) northwest of Moscow, near the village of Lozhki. The location and callsign were unknown until the first known voice broadcast of 1997.[37] In September 2010, the station's transmitter was moved to the nearby city of Saint Petersburg, near the village of Kerro Massiv (60°18′40.73″N 30°16′45.06″E﻿ / ﻿60.3113139°N 30.2791833°E﻿ / 60.3113139; 30.2791833).\nThis may have been due to a reorganization of the Russian military. Prior to 9 August 2015, the station is not transmitting from the Kerro Massiv transmitter site (\"Irtysh\") anymore, possibly due to a reorganization of the Russian military for the particular area which may cause the frequency to be used only in the Moscow Military District. At present, The Buzzer appears to be broadcast only from the 69th Communication Hub in Naro Fominsk, Moscow.[3] In 2011, a group of urban explorers claimed to have explored the buildings at Povarovo to find an abandoned military base and, in it, a radio log record confirming the operation of a transmitter at 4,625 kHz.[better source needed][38][39]\n\nBesides the main callsign, there have been transmissions containing different callsigns such as[citation needed]:\n\nRussian state media RIA Novosti reported on November 14 2025 that the UVB-76 broadcast was temporarily cut off due to a drone strike against a nearby power station.[40]",

    "fullText": "The United States has already been hit with quite a few winter storms over the past several weeks, bringing heavy snow and high winds to parts of the country. Now, another major winter storm is approaching parts of the United States, and the National Weather Service (NWS) has warned about the dangers it could bring.\n\nOn Sunday, the NWS issued a winter storm warning for parts of the country and even a blizzard warning for parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin as Winter Storm Ezra approached, bringing as much as 25 inches of snow and 75 mile per hour winds to some parts of the country.\n\nAs a result of what has been described as a \"dangerous\" and \"potentially life-threatening\" storm, the NWS is urging people in the area to simply stay inside and do not travel.\n\nOn Sunday, the NWS warned of a powerful winter storm that was expected to impact at least 15 states around the country, bringing \"heavy snow, blizzard conditions, hazardous ice, and bitterly cold wind chills\" to some parts of the country.\n\n\"A rapidly-intensifying storm will move from the Great Lakes into southern Canada today through Monday. Heavy snow, blizzard conditions, and icing are expected from the Upper Midwest through the Great Lakes and Northeast,\" the NWS warned in an advisory early Sunday morning.\n\nThe NWS warned of \"blizzard conditions\" that would result in \"dangerous travel conditions.\"\n\nA rapidly intensifying low pressure system will bring a plethora of impactful winter weather hazards through early next week over the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, & Northeast. Heavy snow, blizzard conditions, treacherous icing, high winds, & bitterly cold wind chills are expected. pic.twitter.com/TRZ3YLu3uJ\n\n— NWS Weather Prediction Center (@NWSWPC) December 28, 2025\n\n\"Over a foot of lake-enhanced snow along Michigan's Sioux Falls Upper Peninsula is forecast. Blizzard conditions are likely, resulting in dangerous travel conditions and scattered power outages across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes Omaha into Monday. Heavy lake-effect snow is expected on westerly flow from Lakes Erie and Ontario Monday afternoon into Tuesday,\" the NWS warned.\n\nWhile the NWS map shows areas of the country receiving 18 inches of snow, some meteorologists are predicting up to 36 inches of snow in some areas.\n\nIn addition to the massive snow accumulation, the NWS warned of strong winds and dangerously cold temperatures, as well.\n\n\"Wind gusts in excess of 40 mph and bitterly cold temperatures spilling south from Canada will lead sub-zero wind chills into Monday. Dangerously cold wind chills as cold as -30°F are likely in North Dakota and northern Minnesota,\" the NWS warned.\n\nAs a result of these extreme conditions that have persisted throughout the season, the NWS has continually urged anyone in the area to stay indoors as much as possible, especially amid the sub-zero wind chills and strong winds.\n\n“Cold outside? Avoid the risk of frostbite and hypothermia by dressing in layers, covering exposed skin, and limiting time outdoors,” the NWS wrote in a post on X earlier this month. “If someone might be experiencing either condition, seek medical attention immediately — and know your actions.”\n\nThis type of severe winter weather is especially dangerous for newborns, the elderly, those with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, and unhoused individuals, the NWS warned.\n\n“Everyone is at risk from the dangers of extreme cold, but these groups are more vulnerable than most. Age and certain conditions make the body less able to regulate temperature,” the NWS warns.\n\nThe NWS advised people to limit time outside, but to wear loose layers and cover all skin if they do have to venture outdoors. Additionally, the NWS advises people to consume hot foods and warm drinks, but avoid caffeine and alcohol.\n\nIn addition to urging everyone to stay indoors and out of the elements as much as possible, the NWS has also warned against even attempting to try to travel in these extreme conditions.\n\nThe NWS has issued a blizzard warning for parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin, warning of \"dangerous\" and \"potentially life-threatening\" travel conditions. In those areas, the NWS warned to avoid travel altogether.\n\nOther areas are in a winter storm warning rather than a more severe blizzard warning. In those areas, the NWS still urges people to reconsider and limit their travels and to expect \"considerable travel problems.\"\n\nIf travel is absolutely necessary, the NWS urges travelers to be prepared with some emergency items like a cell phone charger, a flashlight, a first aid kit, jumper cables, road flares, tire chains or snow tires, water and snacks, a full tank of gas, a bag of sand or cat litter, a shovel, an ice scraper, a tow rope, water and snacks, and warm clothing and blankets.\n\n\"You never know when you will encounter winter weather or an emergency road closure,\" the NWS warns.",

    "fullText": "DENVER (KDVR) — Hundreds of flights were delayed at Denver International Airport on Sunday as snow across the country and heavy holiday travel combined to slow operations on one of the busiest travel days of the season.\n\nAirport officials said passenger volume was high as travelers returned home from holiday celebrations, while others arrived in Denver ahead of New Year’s festivities. Long lines formed throughout the airport, from parking shuttles to baggage check and security checkpoints.\n\nSee the latest traffic conditions in Denver on FOX31\n\nSecurity wait times reached about 30 minutes at their peak on Sunday morning. While most travelers moved through the lines without major issues, at least one passenger said the delays caused her to miss a flight.\n\n“I couldn’t get through security, and I had a really nice guy help me get a flight change,” said Kelly Marlor, who was traveling Sunday.\n\nFlightAware reported that more than 480 flights at Denver International Airport were delayed or canceled by 2 p.m. Some travelers also experienced turbulent flights due to windy conditions.\n\n“It was really bad turbulence,” said Sonia Rosenberg, who was visiting friends in Denver. “They couldn’t even give us drinks or snacks on our flight, but it was fine. We made it here. So that’s all that matters.”\n\nDespite the crowds, many travelers said they expected delays and came prepared with extra time. Travelers who spoke to FOX31 said the busy airport was a small price to pay after spending the holidays with loved ones.\n\n“It was a lot of fun,” said Patricia Cunningham, who was traveling home to Albuquerque after visiting her kids for Christmas. “The weather was unusually warm, but we woke up to a little bit of snow today, so that was kind of nice.”\n\nOutside the terminals, reunions played out as friends and family greeted arriving passengers. Risa Nutt and Samantha Freedberg said they were picking up friends they met at summer camp and planned to spend New Year’s together in Denver.\n\n“We’re spending New Year together, so we’re going to take them to all the iconic places,” Nutt said.\n\nAirport officials estimate more than 750,000 passengers traveled through Denver International Airport from Dec. 19 through Sunday.",

    "description": "New information is still emerging.",
    "fullText": "New research suggests captive dolphins may be exposed to more microplastics than wild counterparts — a startling discovery that underscores just how deeply plastic pollution has infiltrated even controlled environments.\n\nA study, published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, aimed to identify microplastics — tiny particles resulting from plastic degradation —  in captive and wild dolphin tissues, including the skin, lung, liver, and gut.\n\nThe researchers said this was an important distinction, as many previous studies only focused on microplastics in gut contents. The scientists hoped to determine whether microplastic contamination extends into tissue.\n\nMicroplastics were found in 80% to 100% of all tissue samples of both wild and captive dolphins, confirming microplastics permeate the entire body rather than remaining confined to the digestive tract.\n\nPerhaps most surprisingly, captive dolphins carried far higher microplastic loads than wild dolphins.\n\nCaptive animals averaged 0.67 microplastics per gram of tissue compared with 0.19 microplastics per gram in wild dolphins.\n\nWild dolphins showed a wider variety of microplastic shapes and colors, which the scientists attributed to diverse environmental sources. Captive dolphins exhibited more uniform types, likely linked to indoor or aquarium-related materials such as textile fibers, facility equipment, or contaminated food and water.\n\nPolyamide and PET were the most common plastic types detected overall. Polyamide, more commonly known as nylon, is often found in textiles, rope, and industrial and auto equipment.\n\nPET, or polyethylene terephthalate, is often found in plastic bottles, food packaging, and polyester clothing.\n\nResearch on microplastics is still emerging, and scientists are only beginning to understand the full impact of these tiny particles. What is clear, however, is that they are incredibly pervasive and can cause lasting harm.\n\nHow do you feel about microplastics being inside our bodies?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"Microplastics … are increasingly recognized as a threat to marine ecosystems,\" the study observed.\n\nThe research highlights just how deeply plastic pollution can infiltrate living organisms — and how even captive species aren't protected from exposure. The higher microplastic loads found in captive dolphins show that plastic contamination extends well beyond our polluted oceans.\n\nPlastics are woven into everyday life — found in textiles, buildings, food packaging, and more. As they degrade, microscopic plastic particles filter out into the environment, infiltrating food, water, and even the air we breathe.\n\nWith such a high presence of microplastics in both wild and captive dolphin tissue, the study raises serious questions about what microplastic loads other marine species — and even humans — may be carrying.\n\nWith microplastic pollution tied to health impacts like cancers, lung problems, hormone disruptions, and more, the stakes are high for all living beings.\n\nMicroplastic research is still developing — and has room for improvement. The experts called for more attention to animal tissues in microplastic research, highlighting that analyzing only gut contents significantly underestimates microplastic toxicity.\n\nThey advocated for multi-tissue monitoring to better understand exposure levels and assess potential health risks for both wildlife and humans.\n\nTo help address plastic pollution's impact on marine life, efforts have historically focused on cleaning up the plastic waste already in our oceans. Attention from governments, conservation groups, and industries has broadened to reduce the amount of plastic produced.\n\nDeveloping alternatives to plastic and restricting the use of certain plastics — like microbeads in cosmetics or single-use plastic bags — are key steps toward reducing pollution. Improving recycling and waste-management systems is also needed, which can prevent plastic from entering waterways in the first place.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Serbia's protesting university students on Sunday collected signatures throughout the country for their request for an early parliamentary election that they hope would oust the autocratic government of President Aleksandar Vucic from office.\n\nBraving freezing weather, the students set up nearly 500 stands in dozens of cities, towns and villages in the Balkan country for residents to sign the election demand, which isn't a formal petition. Students have said that Sunday’s action was meant to put further pressure on Vucic and as a test of support.\n\nYoung protesters have been at the forefront of a nationwide movement against Vucic's populist rule in Serbia. More than a year of street protests first started in November 2024 after a train station disaster that killed 16 people.\n\nThe concrete canopy collapse in the northern city of Novi Sad was widely blamed on alleged rampant corruption and disregard of construction and safety rules during renovation work at the station. No one has been held responsible for the tragedy.\n\nVucic has refused to schedule an immediate early vote, but has suggested that it could be held sometime next year. Both parliamentary and presidential elections are otherwise due in 2027.\n\n“We have stands that serve to connect with the citizens,\" said Igor Dojnov, a student manning one of the points in central Belgrade.\n\nYouth-led protests during the past year have shaken Vucic more than ever during his 13-year-long tenure. Serbia's populist prime minister resigned in January, and Vucic later launched a crackdown on protesters that also drew international criticism.\n\nWhile street protests have subsided, discontent with Vucic's government is believed to be widespread.\n\nMilca Cankovic Kadijevic, a resident of Belgrade, said that she supported the students, because “I have a desire to live decently — me, my children and my grandchildren.\"\n\nVucic has formally promised to take Serbia into the European Union, but he has maintained close links with Russia and China, while facing accusations of clamping down on democratic freedoms and allowing corruption and organized crime to flourish.\n\nHe has denied this, and accused the protesters of attempting to orchestrate a “color revolution” under unspecified orders from the West. The term “color revolution” has been used to describe a series of mass protests at the beginning of the 21st century that sometimes led to the toppling of governments in the former Soviet Union states, the former Yugoslavia, the Middle East and Asia.",

It was FAST & DECISIVE, as all of these situations should be!” Trump wrote.\n\nThe talks in China aim to ensure a sustained ceasefire and promote lasting peace between the countries, according to a statement by Sihasak’s office.\n\nWang was scheduled to join both bilateral meetings with each of the diplomats and a trilateral talk on Monday.\n\nChina has welcomed the ceasefire announcement, which freezes the front lines and allows for displaced civilians to return to their homes near the border.\n\n“China stands ready to continue to provide (the) platform and create conditions for Cambodia and Thailand to have fuller and more detailed communication,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement read.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement comes with a 72-hour observation period, at the end of which Thailand agreed to repatriate 18 Cambodian soldiers it has held as prisoners since earlier fighting in July. Their release has been a major demand of the Cambodian side.\n\nPrak Sokhonn, in a statement after his meeting with Wang, expressed deep appreciation for China’s “vital role” in supporting the ceasefire.\n\nChina also announced 20 million yuan ($2.8 million) of emergency humanitarian aid for Cambodia to assist the displaced.\n\nThe first batch of Chinese aid, including food, tents and blankets, arrived in Cambodia on Sunday, Wang Wenbin, Chinese ambassador to Cambodia, wrote on Facebook.\n\nSihasak said Sunday he hoped the meetings would convey to China that it should both support a sustainable ceasefire and send a signal to Cambodia against reviving the conflict or attempting to create further ones.\n\n“Thailand does not see China merely as a mediator in our conflict with Cambodia but wants China to play a constructive role in ensuring a sustainable ceasefire by sending such signals to Cambodia as well,” he said.",

    "fullText": "A Trump administration official credited the president with making small business owners “excited” to pay their taxes thanks to tax cuts and less regulation.\n\nKelly Loeffler, administrator of the Small Business Administration, told Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures that “small business optimism is above its 52-year average.”\n\nLoeffler said a lot of the optimism is due to the Working Families Tax Cut in Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n“Small businesses finally have certainty about what their tax rate’s going to be,” Loeffler said. “That 20% pass-through deduction, now the 179 expensing that means higher limits on the ability to expense immediately for purchases they make in capital equipment, and also R&D expensing.”\n\nThose factors, according to Loeffler, actually have small business owners jazzed about writing a check to Uncle Sam.\n\n“I don’t think small business owners have ever been so excited to pay their taxes thanks to President Trump!” Loeffler said. “He brought us the blue collar boom in his first term, and now he’s going to add to that the small business boom.”\n\nHost Cheryl Casone, in for Maria Bartiromo, asked Loeffler about “those onerous federal regulations under the Biden administration,” and whether removing them “could be another way to boost the health of small business.”\n\n“Absolutely. Regulation is a tax on a small business, and under President Trump in his first year, about $200 billion in regulations have been cut,” Loeffler said.\n\nThe SBA’s goal for 2026 is “to make sure that small businesses are able to have relief after four very active years of regulating under Joe Biden that heaped trillions of dollars on the backs of small businesses,” Loeffler said. “So, we’re leading a strike force at the SBA to roll back even more regulations.”\n\nLoeffler has been criticized for aggressively cutting staff at the SBA, and for rolling back Biden administration changes “aimed at easing access to credit for the smallest enterprises,” The New York Times reported.\n\n“The changes are especially problematic for Black, Hispanic and immigrant entrepreneurs,” the report continued. “In the name of eradicating diversity, equity and inclusion practices, the Small Business Administration is shedding programs aimed at helping disadvantaged businesses, including those run by women.”\n\nWatch above via Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News.\n\nThe post Trump Official Brags On Fox News: ‘I Don’t Think Small Business Owners Have Ever Been So Excited to Pay Their Taxes!’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "As the S&P 500 hovers near record highs, strategists shrug off concerns of an AI bubble, for now.",
    "fullText": "As stocks sit near all-time highs, strategists are brushing off concerns of an AI bubble.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) is on pace to close out the year with a gain of over 17%, powered by a 26% jump in technology stocks (XLK).\n\n“I don't see a bubble at all. However, I do believe we're going to be going into a bubble,” Sanctuary Wealth chief investment strategist Mary Ann Bartels told Yahoo Finance last week.\n\nBatels compared the current market to prior bubbles, including the late 1920s and the dot-com bubble.\n\n“We're tracking pretty similarly. In fact, it's kind of eerie how we're actually tracking that pattern,” she said. “I see a bubble occurring but not out until maybe ’29 into ’30.”\n\nBut for the time being, Sanctuary strategists forecast that tech will continue leading the market higher out into the end of the decade. They place the S&P 500 anywhere between 10,000 and 13,000 by 2030.\n\n“That's why we're calling 2026, you know, to be fearless, that there's still significant upside in this market, particularly for technology,” she said.\n\nPart of the upside comes from semiconductor stocks. Once treated as commodity plays, they become growth stocks, with Nvidia (NVDA) “basically rewriting the path for semiconductor chips.”\n\nThe AI chip powerhouse has surged over 40% so far this year, pushing its market cap to $4.6 trillion and making it the most valuable publicly traded company. On Friday, Nvidia shares rose after the company announced a $20 billion licensing deal with specialized chipmaker Groq (GROQ.PVT).\n\nThe deal was announced as the chip space has heated up, with Alphabet's Google (GOOG) making headlines with its specialized customer chips called TPUs.\n\nAlphabet stock has soared some 65% year to date.\n\nUBS strategists also expect the AI boom and robust profit growth to underpin market gains in 2026.\n\n“We note that forward price-to-earnings multiples are only marginally higher than at the start of the year, reinforcing the fact that earnings growth and not valuation bubbles have driven market gains,” wrote the strategists last week.\n\nUBS forecasts S&P 500 earnings per share to grow about 10% year over year, pushing the index to 7,700 by the end of next year.\n\nVeteran strategist Ed Yardeni also sees the index reaching 7,700 next year, with the probability of his \"Roaring 2020s\" scenario at 60%. He cited, among other reasons, tax benefits from the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" that passed this year and the AI boom.\n\nIn October, Goldman Sachs analysts argued the stock market isn’t in a bubble because tech stocks have risen mostly due to actual growth, not speculative bets. The firm noted that top-performing companies have strong balance sheets and the AI sector is still mostly led by a few big players, while most bubbles occur when many new entrants rush into a hot sector.",

    "fullText": "The craft beer apocalypse, which industry experts assert began in 2023, is completing its third year and continues to leave victims in its trail.\n\nThe apocalypse reportedly began in 2023 after the Brewers Association posted historic amounts of craft brewery closures of over 385 for the year, Paste reported. Since then, many more craft breweries have shut their doors.\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming that the apocalypse continued in 2025, as over 250 breweries in the U.S. closed down permanently in the first six months of the year, and many more have followed those closings in the second half of the year.\n\nAmong the reasons given for breweries closing have been rising costs of ingredients, labor, and products, slowing taproom traffic, and fierce retail competition, according to American Craft Beer.\n\nOne of the most recent closings was Miamisburg, Ohio, craft brewery Entropy Brewing Company, which revealed on social media that it would close down its business permanently on Dec. 27, 2025, with no plans yet to file for bankruptcy.\n\nOthers that filed for Chapter 7 liquidation and planned to close down included St. Petersburg, Fla.-based brewery Dissent Craft Brewing, which filed bankruptcy in August; Exton, Pa.-based Iron Hill Brewery LLC and San Jose, Calif.-based Strike Brewing Company, which both filed in October; and Oregon-based Rogue Ales & Spirits, which filed in November.\n\nAnd now, New Mexico-based Bosque Brewing Company is closing down all of its taproom locations and ending its business after a federal judge dismissed the brewer's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case on Dec. 22 because it had too much debt to reorganize, KOB-TV 4 in Albuquerque reported.\n\nThe dismissal of the Chapter 11 case will likely prompt the brewery company to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation unless it can settle all of its debts with its creditors out of court.\n\nBosque Brewing said that it will shut down all of its remaining public houses on Dec. 28 at 5 p.m. Mountain Standard Time, in a message it posted on its website on Dec. 26.\n\n\"With heavy hearts, we are closing all Bosque branded Public Houses. Nob Hill will close today (Dec. 26) at 5 pm and the rest of the taprooms will close on Sunday, December 28th at 5pm,\" the message said.\n\nThe brewery had 11 locations in New Mexico before closing The Drinkery at 4980 Promenade Blvd. and its Restoration Pizza at 1607 Alcaldesa Street, both in Santa Fe, on Dec. 3.",

    "fullText": "A 23-year-old independent YouTube journalist’s video exposing examples of what he calls “potentially the largest fraud scandal in U.S. history” in Minnesota has racked up more than 90 million views in just two days on X and YouTube, accelerating a cascading narrative around abuse of social services centered mostly on the state’s Somali population.\n\nIn the 42-minute video, Nick Shirley, wearing a grey hoodie and working with a fellow independent investigator he identifies only as “David,” visits a series of social-service oriented businesses in and around the Twin Cities to confront “the people who are making millions of dollars” from social services including meal programs, housing assistance and health services – though the biggest piece seems to be childcare centers, where Shirley shows up during weekday business hours to find no children present.\n\nDavid says his personal inquiry, which has included his own research and sources at the statehouse in St. Paul, has uncovered more than 1,000 fraudulent service-oriented businesses, more than 800 of which are Somali-owned. He says he began investigating when he noticed childless day-care centers and drivers for a “non-emergency medical transportation” service based near his office that never carried any passengers.\n\nIn the video, Shirley says the schemes’ now-estimated $9 billion in purported pilfered public funds is “so much fraud it could almost replace the entire GDP of Somalia,” which is estimated at $12 billion.\n\n“Here is the full 42 minutes of my crew and I exposing Minnesota fraud, this might be my most important work yet,” Shirley wrote in the viral X post. “We uncovered over $110,000,000 in ONE day. Like it and share it around like wildfire! Its time to hold these corrupt politicians and fraudsters accountable. We ALL work way too hard and pay too much in taxes for this to be happening, the fraud must be stopped.”\n\nHere is the full 42 minutes of my crew and I exposing Minnesota fraud, this might be my most important work yet. We uncovered over $110,000,000 in ONE day. Like it and share it around like wildfire! Its time to hold these corrupt politicians and fraudsters accountable\n\nWe ALL… pic.twitter.com/E3Penx2o7a\n\n— Nick shirley (@nickshirleyy) December 26, 2025\n\nMinnesota’s unfolding fraud scandal has implicated dozens of businesses and individuals who are accused of enriching themselves via submitting fraudulent claims funded by both state and federal taxpayer dollars. Charges for at least five new alleged fraudsters were announced earlier this month by Joe Thompson, first assistant U.S. District Attorney for the state of Minnesota, including allegedly fraudulent Medicaid claims involving a “housing stabilization services program.”\n\nThompson characterized the schemes, each of which have allegedly collected millions, as a “fraud tourism” scheme that is under investigation by state and federal agencies including the FBI, Homeland Security and the Justice Department. He said more charges will be announced in the future.\n\nProsecutors have publicly stated that Minnesota may have lost up to $9 billion in misappropriated aid — a figure that has drawn national scrutiny as the investigation continues.\n\nShirley started posting regularly to his YouTube channel in 2019, and has built a large online following by posting videos that combine on-the-ground interviews, commentary, and investigative style reporting, especially on political and social topics. His content often involves interviewing people in public spaces, exploring controversial issues and presenting bold narratives about social unrest, immigration, protests, and alleged fraud.\n\nHis significant following leans toward conservative digital circles – his posts are amplified by political figures like Elon Musk and JD Vance – and has attracted criticism over his methods and perceived bias.\n\nShirley posted a YouTube video of himself meeting with Donald Trump at the White House in October, wherein he tells the president that he’s found evidence that antifa-style protests are stocked with the same people who are “bussed” to various cities to stage the demonstrations.\n\nThe post Young Journalist’s Video Exposing Alleged Billion-Dollar Fraud Scheme in Minnesota Goes Viral ‘Like Wildfire’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "Police Scotland said that domestic abuse wouldn’t be tolerated in its pursuit to hold perpetrators accountable",
    "fullText": "Serial domestic abusers in Scotland were sentenced to a total of almost 230 years in prison this year in a major crackdown by the police.\n\nThe force reported that 32 offenders accumulated total sentences of more than 228 years in 2025, with one person given 17 years in jail.\n\nThey were convicted of 240 offences following proactive investigations by Police Scotland’s domestic abuse task force.\n\nThe crimes involved 110 victims, all women and children, with offences including rape, sexual assault, stalking, permanent disfigurement, danger to life, threats against pets and more under the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act.\n\nDomestic abuse crimes have increased by 10 per cent in Scotland over the last year, while detection rates have only increased by nearly 8 per cent.\n\nPolice Scotland officers respond to a domestic abuse call every eight minutes, per the latest figures. More than 66,000 incidents were reported between October 2024 and September this year, of which 40.3 per cent resulted in a crime being recorded.\n\nAssistant chief constable Steve Johnson, executive lead for major crime, public protection, and local crime, said that the force remained “relentless” in tackling domestic abuse.\n\nHe said: “Our officers are determined to ensure women and girls live free from violence and abuse. We are relentless in our focus on tackling domestic abuse. It will not be tolerated, and perpetrators will be held accountable.\n\n“We tackle violence against women and girls every day of the year, preventing harm and bringing offenders to justice. We don’t do this alone but work with partners to identify and address the societal issues at the root of gender-based violence, so that we can stop abusive behaviour before it begins.\n\n“No one should have to experience abuse. We are committed to supporting all victim-survivors, protecting them, and investigating every report of domestic abuse so they can come forward with confidence. Help is available, and you don’t have to face this alone.\n\n“As we look ahead to 2026, our message to offenders remains the same. If you continue to abuse and exhibit abusive behaviour, you will be caught and anyone who continues to abuse will face the full force of the law.”\n\nBetween 25 November and 10 December, the force took part in an annual initiative focused on eliminating gender-based violence called 16 Days of Activism, in which they arrested 500 perpetrators of domestic abuse and charged more than 380.\n\nThe national domestic abuse helpline offers support for women on 0808 2000 247, or you can visit the Refuge website. There is a dedicated men's advice line on 0808 8010 327. Those in the US can call the domestic violence hotline on 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

    "description": "My grandmother's wedding letter felt strange at first, but months later her warning shaped how I understand marriage, forgiveness, and real partnership.",
    "fullText": "I married my husband, Scott, in April 2025 after four years of dating.\n\nNobody was more excited for the wedding than our families. They rallied around us, sharing tips and calming me down when the planning became stressful.\n\nMy sister made a scrapbook for me to open the night before the nuptials. Inside, there were handwritten letters from my bridesmaids, my mom, and my 79-year-old grandmother.\n\nThe letters were sweet, romantic, and optimistic — well, almost all of them were. My grandmother's letter had an ominous tone.\n\n\"I wish you and Scott all the happiness in the world in your married life. I am sure you two are just right for each other. That's not to say it will all be plain sailing,\" she wrote.\n\n\"There may be bumps along the road,\" she added, \"but love has a way of forgiving a multitude of sins.\"\n\nIt was a huge contrast to the other letters in the scrapbook. While my bridesmaids reminisced about the past and shared excitement for my future, my grandma's words stopped me in my tracks.\n\nI remember laughing and shaking my head in disbelief. I then handed the letter to my mom, who was equally unimpressed.\n\nIt's not that I didn't appreciate the advice. But really, who wants to hear the words \"love\" and \"sins\" mentioned in the same sentence? Especially when it's in relation to your own husband.\n\nFor a brief moment, I contemplated what she meant by the word \"sins.\" Cheating? Lying? Or something else?\n\nMy gran has a fantastic relationship with my husband, so I couldn't imagine what sparked her cautionary words. Similarly, I had never spoken a bad word about Scott to my grandmother.\n\nOf course, like any couple, we'd had fights, but it was never anything relationship-threatening. And I had never spoken about it with my her.\n\nUltimately, I disregarded the note, just as you would ignore a speck of dirt on a white wedding dress. Even if nobody else notices it, you know it's there.\n\nThe wedding day was picture-perfect.\n\nI felt so fortunate that we got to celebrate with our loved ones, especially our grandmothers. Both Scott and I were the first grandchildren in our families to get married, so it felt extra special.\n\nFive months later, I found my grandma's letter while looking through the scrapbook. It looked different to me with fresh eyes. Now that some time had passed, I could look at it from a new perspective. I could read without taking it personally.\n\nI thought about my grandmother's life, and I realized that her words were never about my husband and me.\n\nMy gran married my late grandfather when they were just teenagers, and it's fair to say they had many bumps in their own love story. Let's just say, their relationship wasn't like the kind I grew up watching in romantic comedies and Disney films.\n\nHowever, they loved each other deeply. They were loyal, forgiving, and supported each other throughout their more than 50-year marriage.\n\nThinking about their relationship reminded me that falling in love is a feeling, but staying in love is a choice. It's an action. It's not something that just happens to a person.\n\nThe wedding is the beautiful part, but the marriage? That's where things have the potential to get messy.\n\nI've been married for less than a year, so I'm not pretending to know all the answers. But if I'm honest with myself, I can admit that my grandma's letter shook me because it didn't fit the aesthetic Instagram version of what I thought marriage was supposed to be.\n\nI know that my husband and I have a great deal of joy ahead of us. But we're also going to witness one another's pain, grief, disappointment, and growth. That's just a part of sharing your life with someone.\n\nIf I ever catch myself feeling unprepared, I know I can revisit my grandma's letter.",

    "fullText": "Lou Gerstner, the former CEO of IBM who led the company through one of the most consequential turnarounds in corporate history, died on Saturday at the age of 83, the company said.\n\nGerstner ran IBM from 1993 to 2002, arriving at a time when the company was under severe pressure, and its future was in doubt. IBM was losing money, the tech industry was shifting rapidly, and there was widespread expectation that the company would be broken up.\n\nInstead, Gerstner chose to keep IBM together. He pushed the company to organize around customer needs rather than internal divisions, helping reposition IBM as a provider of integrated technology and services for large enterprises. That decision became central to IBM's recovery and renewed relevance.\n\nGerstner also drove cultural change inside the company. He emphasized direct decision-making, accountability, and execution, while insisting that innovation mattered only if it translated into real value for clients. The approach marked a sharp break from IBM's inward-looking habits that had taken hold before his arrival, IBM said in its announcement of Gerstner's death.\n\nHis tenure included painful restructuring. IBM abandoned long-standing traditions, including its decades-long \"cradle to grave\" no-layoff policy, as it sought to stabilize its finances and compete more aggressively. Many credit those moves, along with Gerstner's strategic focus, with saving the company from collapse.\n\nBefore joining IBM, Gerstner built a high-profile career in corporate America. He was a partner at McKinsey & Company, later served as president of American Express, and was CEO of RJR Nabisco. After leaving IBM, he chaired the Carlyle Group and focused on philanthropy, particularly in education and biomedical research.\n\nA native of Long Island, New York, Gerstner earned a degree from Dartmouth College and an MBA from Harvard. IBM said it plans to hold a celebration of his legacy in the new year.",

    "title": "Sam Altman says OpenAI's latest job opening pays over half a million dollars a year and is 'stressful'",
    "description": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned on X that the job would be \"stressful\" and they'll need to \"jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.\"",
    "fullText": "OpenAI wants to pay someone over half a million dollars to mitigate the downsides of AI.\n\nIf that seems like a lot of money, consider those potential downsides: job loss, misinformation, abuse by malicious actors, environmental destruction, and the erosion of human agency, to name a few.\n\nCEO Sam Altman described the job as \"stressful\" in an X post on Saturday. \"You'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,\" Altman wrote.\n\nAltman said the \"head of preparedness\" position is \"a critical role at an important time.\"\n\n\"Models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges. The potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025; we are just now seeing models get so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities,\" he wrote.\n\nOpenAI's ChatGPT has helped popularize AI chatbots among consumers, many of whom use the technology to research topics, draft emails, plan trips, or perform other simple tasks.\n\nSome users also talk to the bots as an alternative to therapy, which has exacerbated mental health issues in some cases, encouraging delusions and other concerning behavior.\n\nOpenAI said in October it was working with mental health professionals to improve how ChatGPT interacts with users who exhibit concerning behavior, including psychosis or self-harm.\n\nOpenAI's core mission is to develop artificial intelligence in a way that benefits all of humanity. It made safety protocols a central part of its operations from the outset. As it began releasing products, however, and pressure to turn a profit grew, some former staffers have said the company began to prioritize profit over safety.\n\nJan Leiki, the former leader of the now-dissolved safety team at OpenAI, said in a May 2024 post on X announcing his resignation that the company had lost sight of its mission to ensure the technology is deployed safely.\n\n\"Building smarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor. OpenAI is shouldering an enormous responsibility on behalf of all of humanity,\" he wrote. \"But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\"\n\nLess than a week later, another staffer announced their resignation on X, also citing safety concerns. One former staffer, Daniel Kokotajlo, said in a May 2024 blog post that he resigned because he was \"losing confidence that it would behave responsibly around the time of AGI.\"\n\nKokotajlo later told Fortune that OpenAI initially had about 30 people researching safety issues related to AGI, a still theoretical version of AI that reasons as well as humans, but a series of departures reduced that head count by almost half.\n\nThe company's former head of preparedness, Aleksander Madry, assumed a new role in July 2024. The position is part of OpenAI's Safety Systems team, which develops safeguards, frameworks, and evaluations for the company's models. The job pays $555,000 a year plus equity.\n\n\"You will be the directly responsible leader for building and coordinating capability evaluations, threat models, and mitigations that form a coherent, rigorous, and operationally scalable safety pipeline,\" the job listing says.",

    "title": "These work besties ditched their corporate jobs and poured their savings into an athleisure brand",
    "description": "Tiffany Chng and Olivia Yiong were work besties. Both were laid off, so during the pandemic, they ditched corporate and launched an athleisure brand.",
    "fullText": "Tiffany Chng and Olivia Yiong said they went from being work besties to regular besties and then work besties again.\n\nThe duo, both 31, met in 2018 and became inseparable while working at GuavaPass, a fitness app. Yiong was laid off when Guavapass was acquired by ClassPass in 2019.\n\nTwo years later, during the pandemic, Chng was laid off from her marketing job. The duo reunited to launch an athleisure brand, then called Butter, despite having no experience in fashion or entrepreneurship.\n\nChng's retrenchment and the pandemic lockdown gave them the push they needed to start the brand.\n\n\"At that point, we had nothing to lose,\" Yiong said.\n\nThey started with online sales, and in October this year, they opened their first retail store in Singapore's upscale ION Orchard mall, in the heart of the city's luxury shopping district.\n\nBuilding a brand during the pandemic in an already saturated market and for a conservative audience was not easy.\n\nExercise and sports have always been a big part of the founders' lives.\n\nYiong was an F45 trainer, has practiced yoga, pilates, and Muay Thai, and is now training for her first Hyrox. Chng was part of a national team representing Singapore at the 2011 Touch Rugby World Cup and has also dabbled in cheerleading, pilates, yoga, and HIIT.\n\nWhen Chng was laid off from ClassPass in 2020, they decided to go all in on an athleisure clothing line, which started off with the name \"Butter.\" They invested 20,000 Singapore dollars in 2020 into the brand.\n\nHalf came from Yiong's savings, and the other half came from Chng's severance pay.\n\nThey started product design in March 2020 and found suppliers in China. They launched in October that year with just two products in two colors: a longline sports bra and a pair of leggings.\n\nCOVID lockdowns that pushed everyone online helped them gain visibility. About 500 people joined an online workout they hosted in March 2021.\n\nIn 2022, they sold the brand to Love, Bonito, a Singaporean women's wear brand. Afterward, they changed the brand's name to Cheak.\n\nLaunching an athleisure brand in Singapore came with a unique set of challenges.\n\nWomen in Singapore and Southeast Asia place a high value on modesty and require padding in the bust, the duo said.\n\n\"A lot of overseas brands don't have padding. In Singapore, you need padding; it's non-negotiable. One of the most commonly asked questions we get is, 'Does it have padding?'\" Chng said.\n\n\"But padding changes the construction completely for the product — it requires so many more stitches, and it makes it difficult to have a very clean bind,\" she added.\n\nAnother issue was the sheerness of the fabric.\n\n\"Overseas brands don't double line their lighter colors because I think the women are a bit more comfortable with a slight sheerness, but in Singapore, that's not acceptable,\" she said.\n\n\"But when you double-line a garment, it becomes very thick. So, we spent about a year changing the fabric and reducing its thickness so that when we double-lined it, it would still be comfortable,\" Chng added.\n\nDesigning clothes for a customer base that likes to play it safe requires a good deal of restraint, the founders said. They said there was plenty they wanted to experiment with, but had to tone down.\n\n\"A lot of brands that are quite popular internationally are quite sexy and crazy nowadays,\" Yiong said. \"So we take that idea, and tweak it to what will work for our audience.\"\n\nSingapore is becoming a competitive space for athleisure brands. Alo Yoga, the athleisure brand worn by Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber, opened its first store in the city's Marina Bay Sands mall in September.\n\nIn ION Orchard, the mall where Cheak is located, shoppers can also find Lululemon, Cotton On Body, and Adidas.\n\nTo stand out, Cheak focuses on making clothes for Asian women — and that doesn't just mean making them more petite.\n\n\"The bust shape is different, our waists are smaller, our hips are slightly wider, and the femur is also a little bit shorter,\" Yiong said.\n\nSizing is different for Asian women, too, she added.\n\n\"We don't necessarily grow taller as we get bigger; we grow width-wise,\" Yiong said.\n\nShe also said that international brands do not suitably cater to the hot and humid climate that Southeast Asia is known for.\n\n\"Fresh international brands, let's say Alo, for example, they come in bringing winter season clothes,\" she said. \"There's no winter; we only have one season, so the fabric needs to be cooling.\"\n\nCheak's prices are slightly lower than those of its foreign competitors. One of Cheak's bestselling sports bras costs 55 Singapore dollars, or about $42, while a similar-looking piece from Lululemon costs S$58.\n\nThe business has yet to come between the founders.\n\n\"Outside of work, we don't talk about work,\" Chng said. \"We see each other on weekends, and our partners hang out together, but we never talk about work.\"\n\nOn the flipside, at work, they don't talk about other things, helping to distinguish their \"work personality and friend personality.\"\n\nYiong handles the backend work, while Chng handles the creative and customer-facing parts of the work.\n\nBut work and life inevitably collide, like when they go on holiday together and fire up their laptops to solve a crisis.\n\n\"Our partners see that as their cue to go do their own thing,\" Yiong joked.\n\nRunning their business comes with many perks. Chng, who just had a baby, said she loves having a flexible schedule and working in a hybrid setting.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it's less stressful than a corporate job.\n\n\"I think a lot of people glamorize what being a founder or starting your own business is,\" she said. \"You have to be able to give up everything, your time, your money, your brain power, your emotions into the business because if you don't do it, no one else is going to.\"\n\nShe added, \"It takes a different kind of resilience to handle it, but at the same time, I wouldn't trade it for anything.\"",

    "title": "I'm a professional chocolatier. When cocoa prices spiked, I found ways to make better chocolate — not smaller bars.",
    "description": "When cocoa prices doubled, chocolatier Jerome Peñafort of Mr. Bucket Chocolaterie refused shrinkflation by finding new ways to innovate.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jerome Peñafort, 38, the founder of Mr. Bucket Chocolaterie in Singapore. The following has been edited for length and clarity\n\nOnce prices go up, they rarely come back down — and that's definitely true for cocoa.\n\nFor a small business where the main material is cocoa, it's a real issue when your core ingredient keeps getting more expensive.\n\nWe work directly with farmers across Southeast Asia, so even before prices started climbing around mid-2023, we were already paying about two to three times the market rate — and now we're paying even more.\n\nWe're still paying the same higher price to our farmers, even though cocoa prices on financial exchanges have softened in recent months, because yields have dropped due to global warming and disease.\n\nThe higher cocoa prices have cut into profit margins. We're not profitable every month or year.\n\nThat has forced us to think differently about how we work: how we innovate, how we become more efficient, and how we stay true to our purpose.\n\nBefore founding Mr. Bucket, I worked in private equity and real estate, where I learned most of my business concepts.\n\nAbout eight years ago, my dad got involved in my uncle's chocolate manufacturing company. I joined the team around 2019 and began learning about chocolate and the entire supply chain.\n\nDuring that time, I had a conversation with a buyer from China that really sparked the idea of Mr. Bucket. We were selling entry-level supermarket chocolate when he told me that even if our chocolate was similar in quality to European brands, it would always be priced lower — simply because it wasn't made in Europe.\n\nThat really made me think: Why is Asian chocolate seen as inferior to European chocolate? Cocoa grows near the equator — in Asia, Africa, Central and South America — but not in Europe. It's just processed there.\n\nIn 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we launched Mr Bucket as an independent company and started making chocolate in Singapore when operations in Malaysia were disrupted. That's when I realized that chocolate made from Asian beans is delicious.\n\nOur first collaboration was with local snack brand The Golden Duck, when we infused their salted-egg flavor into our bonbons — a chocolate shell with layered fillings.\n\nA post shared by Mr. Bucket Chocolaterie (@mrbucketchocolaterie)\n\nDays after we launched the campaign, Singapore announced a lockdown, and because everyone was stuck at home, the response was amazing. We sold out hundreds of boxes of bonbons in two weeks.\n\nIn late 2020, Mr. Bucket launched a retail outlet in a local residential neighborhood, and in 2022, we opened a café at Dempsey Hill, a lifestyle destination in Singapore.\n\nWe can't plan our business around the hope that cocoa prices will come down. If they do, it's a bonus.\n\nHigh cocoa prices have forced us to be more productive and innovative in every part of the business.\n\nThe biggest change was in the product itself.\n\nWe started using the whole cacao fruit — not just the nibs that are usually ground with cocoa butter and sugar to make chocolate. We also use the husk and the pulp, which have a lot of flavor — but which are usually discarded — in our café offerings.\n\nWe drew inspiration from coffee and tea, using cacao to make beverages, broth, and even gelato. That helped us diversify and reduce waste.\n\nBecause of these changes, our overall cost of goods has gone down by about 15% to 20% compared with last year, even though raw cocoa prices are higher.\n\nInstead of using a lot of labor to do things by hand, we started automating certain parts. We bought new machinery and increased batch sizes.\n\nThrough it all, we've never changed our recipes, and we won't. We will not compromise on quality.\n\nWe're not reducing sizes either. In fact, some of our products are bigger now, like chocolates with caramel or kaya — a local coconut jam — centers.\n\nWe did a price increase last year. But as we became more efficient, we were able to bring some prices back down a little.\n\nIn this economy, consumers are definitely more conscious of their spending, but we've still seen growth.\n\nTo achieve that, we've had to work a lot harder: put out more products, do more collaborations, and create new products constantly.\n\nFor Christmas, we've launched a festive collection with new flavors like butterscotch and fruitcake.\n\nOur first-year revenue was less than $1 million Singapore dollars. We expect over SG$5 million, or $3.9 million, this year.\n\nWe're not just making chocolate.\n\nWe want to change the perception of Asian chocolate to show that it can be as good as any in the world.\n\nThat's what keeps us going: not cutting corners, but finding new ways to make better chocolate and to build a future for Asian cocoa.\n\nDo you run a small business in Asia affected by rising prices?

Chelsea have launched an investigation but have not commented officially at this stage.\n\nIt is also unclear whether referee Stuart Attwell and his officials saw the incident or whether it will be included in his report.

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nSenne Lammens (Manchester United): I was going to put David Raya in but I thought one good save doesn't get you in the Team of the Week - the bar is higher than that. He made four or five good saves against Newcastle, conducted his box well and has given Manchester United a platform and base to build off - which they've never had. All that for £18m, not bad at all.\n\nDeclan Rice (Arsenal): I obviously worked the game between Arsenal and Brighton at the weekend and Declan Rice filled in at right-back. He was still massively influential, marauding forward and defensively he was solid. He never had anyone at Brighton get at him. He just handled every situation well.\n\nArchie Gray (Tottenham): This one is a little bit dodgy, but I'm putting him in the team anyway. I'm aware he played in midfield against Crystal Palace but the reason I'm putting him there is because I felt like he needed to get in the team. Simply put: he got the winner and he's done every single thing that Spurs have asked of him - played left-back, played right-back, played right wing. You name it, he's done it all. I think he goes in for that situation\n\nKevin Danso (Tottenham): He was going to Wolves at one point but Spurs swooped in and signed him. I think he was meant to be a squad player but every time he steps in, he's fantastic. He doesn't do anything wrong. He just delivers on what he's supposed to do.\n\nLisandro Martinez (Manchester United): He's only 5ft7, 5ft8 and he had Nick Woltemade in his back pocket all day. It was really good to see him back playing after his massive injury. Him being back fit is monumental, not only for him but his World Cup aspirations as well.\n\nRyan Gravenberch (Liverpool): His influence is very simple: if he plays well, Liverpool play well. Obviously he got a goal against a Wolves team that they had to break down, nice finish. You don't really get that much credit for scoring against Wolves if I'm being totally honest, but he was very instrumental.\n\nTijjani Reijnders (Manchester City): Probably his best game since the first game of the season against Wolves. Not only the goal but his impact on the game. He's starting to show what he did at AC Milan. I really like him as a player.\n\nFlorian Wirtz (Liverpool): Again, he scored against Wolves - who will probably go down as the worst team in Premier League history - but he's growing into it and starting to fill into the shirt. Maybe the absences of Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak have made players start to play through him - and he's starting to be the player we all believed he could be.\n\nRayan Cherki (Manchester City): For me, he's the best player in world football to watch at the moment. He tries things and he's confident on the ball. Even when he makes mistakes, he doesn't care and tries again. He finished the weekend with a goal and an assist. He's the most exciting footballer to watch at this moment in time, and I say that over Lamine Yamal and everyone else.\n\nKevin Schade (Brentford): If you score a hat-trick, you end up in the Team of the Week. It's as simple as that. I nearly put Keith Andrews as the manager of the week.\n\nOllie Watkins (Aston Villa): We don't normally put players in who start on the bench. However, we've broken our rules. He had such an impact in the second half against Chelsea that he has to go in.\n\nUnai Emery (Aston Villa): Unbelievable result. Eleven wins on the bounce. I thought he not only got it spot-on tactically in the second-half, but his in-game managing and the changes he made - most notably when he brought on Ollie Watkins - showed the level he is currently operating at.\n\nHe outcoached Enzo Maresca, who everyone says is a top coach. I think he just showed the level of where he is truly at as a coach and what he can offer.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "Former champion Luke Humphries survived a scare to progress to the fourth round of the PDC World Championship as four previous winners won on Sunday.\n\nHumphries, who beat Luke Littler to win the 2024 title, saw off Germany's Gabriel Clemens 4-2.\n\nThe 30-year-old raced into a 3-0 lead but was pegged back to 3-2 and Clemens missed darts to level before Humphries set up a fourth-round tie against Nathan Aspinall or Kevin Doets.\n\nThree-time winner Michael van Gerwen also progressed with a 4-1 win over German debutant Arno Merk.\n\nHe led 2-0 before being pegged back but found another gear to set up a last-16 tie with two-time winner Gary Anderson.\n\nAnderson won a final-set thriller against Jermaine Wattimena in the afternoon to progress alongside 2018 winner Rob Cross.\n\nCross brushed aside Australian 16th seed Damon Heta in a comfortable 4-0 win and will face defending champion Luke Littler in the next round.\n\nThe Netherlands' 10th seed Gian van Veen also progressed after seeing off Latvia's Madars Razma with a 4-1 victory, while 20th seed Ryan Searle reached the fourth round for the first time since 2021 with a 4-0 demolition of Germany's Martin Schindler.",
