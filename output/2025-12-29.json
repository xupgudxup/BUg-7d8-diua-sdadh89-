    "fullText": "The Buffalo Bills will not be AFC East champions.\n\nAgainst one of the best teams in the NFC on Sunday, they looked little like Super Bowl contenders.\n\nA daunting Eagles defense stifled the Bills then held off a late rally for a 13-12 win in Buffalo. The loss combined with a runaway New England win over the New York Jets earlier Sunday secured the AFC East title for the Patriots.\n\nAfter being held off the scoreboard for the first 54 minutes of the game, the Bills rallied to score two touchdowns in the final 5:11. But they trailed 13-12 after the second touchdown thanks to a blocked extra point on their first.\n\nAt that point, with both teams exhausted and the game clock almost expired, the Bills opted to gamble with a 2-point conversion attempt instead of kicking and extra point for overtime. The gamble failed when Josh Allen's pass fell incomplete in the end zone. Fittingly, Allen threw the ill-fated pass under duress from Philadelphia's pass rush.\n\nALLEN'S PASS IS INCOMPLETE. THE EAGLES WILL WIN!! pic.twitter.com/hixSq2sZfa\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 29, 2025\n\nThe Eagles, meanwhile, entered Sunday locked into the NFC East title and out of the No. 1 seed in the NFC. They didn't have much to play for. But they improved their chances of moving past the Chicago Bears from the No. 3 seed to No. 2 with Sunday's win.\n\nAnd, perhaps, more importantly, their defense was overwhelming in a game that was billed as a potential Super Bowl preview.\n\nThe Bills have long operated as a second-half team and entered Sunday's game leading the NFL in second-half point differential (+109). They added to that differential with a 12-0 advantage after halftime. But it wasn't enough to secure the win after a dominant effort from Philadelphia's defense through most of the game.\n\nThe Eagles limited the Bills to three punts and a fumble in the first half en route to a 13-0 lead. They set the tone early with a sack of Josh Allen that forced a fumble that bounced from the Buffalo 30-yard line into Philadelphia territory.\n\nOUR BALL pic.twitter.com/qjS9W0nE3F\n\n— Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) December 28, 2025\n\nPhiladelphia recovered and converted the turnover into a Jalen Hurts touchdown pass to Dallas Goedert for a 7-0 lead. From there, the Bills were playing on the their heels against a Philadelphia defensive front that dominated their offensive line.\n\nWhen the Bills punted to conclude the opening drive of the second half after a scoreless first, fans who weathered cold rain in the Buffalo stands responded with boos.\n\nThe Bills didn't broach the red zone until the final five minutes of the third quarter. When they got to fourth-and-goal, they didn't convert.\n\nAllen took off for the end zone when he couldn't find an open receiver in the end zone. He escaped pressure only to be met by multiple Eagles defenders at the goal line. Zack Baun tackled him short of the goal line to force a turnover on downs.\n\nJosh Allen does not get there and the Eagles force the turnover on downs at the goal line!\n\n📺: FOX pic.twitter.com/HQgLCcm9OS\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 28, 2025\n\nBuffalo's next possession started at Philadelphia's 41 after the Eagles punted from their own end zone. It ended with another punt after Josh Allen lost 19 yards on a third-down sack.\n\nAgain, Allen couldn't find any open receivers. This time he ran backward in a failed effort to buy time from the Eagles' pass rush before Jalyx Hunt took him down for his second sack of the day.\n\nOn the Hunt pic.twitter.com/t3ipIHeMwR\n\n— Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) December 28, 2025\n\nPhiladelphia's offense was somehow worse in a second half that produced just 17 yards from scrimmage. But the Bills mustered too little too late after failing to score until an Allen touchdown sneak with 5:11 remaining.\n\nThe Bills mounted their late, last touchdown drive after forcing the fourth straight Philadelphia three-and-out of the second half. And they kept hope alive with a fourth-and-10 hook-and-lateral that set up a deep pass from Allen to Brandin Cooks to get into the red zone.\n\nARE YOU SERIOUS!?\n\n📺: FOX pic.twitter.com/MRjder4QGo\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 29, 2025\n\nBut Philadelphia's defense ultimately came up with one last stop on the 2-point conversion to secure the win.\n\nWhen the day was done, the Eagles had sacked Allen five times for a loss of 51 yards. They hit him six other times and kept the pressure on almost every time he dropped back. And they came up with stops when it mattered most.\n\nThe offensive woes that have plagued Philadelphia for much of the season continued as the Bills outgained the Eagles, 330-190. But the defense that anchored the Eagles' 10-5 start was good enough to secured win No. 11 on Sunday.",

    "description": "After not playing against Georgetown & not traveling to Creighton, this seemed like only a matter of time.",
    "fullText": "Our long national nightmare is over: After a DNP-CD on December 17 and a Did Not Travel — Personal Reasons on December 20th, Marquette men’s basketball announced on Sunday night that junior Zaide Lowery is no longer a part of the team.\n\nMarquette junior guard Zaide Lowery departs #MUBB program. pic.twitter.com/WZBJ2QIv5x\n\n— Marquette Basketball (@MarquetteMBB) December 28, 2025\n\nJunior guard Zaide Lowery will not return to the Marquette University men’s basketball program, head coach Shaka Smart announced this afternoon.\n\n“I would like to thank Zaide for his many contributions to our program over the last two and a half years,” Smart said. “We wish him the best in all of his future pursuits on and off the court.”\n\nLowery played in 73 career games for the Golden Eagles and started in nine of his 11 appearances in 2025-26, contributing 8.1 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.\n\nI find the phrasing interesting.\n\nThe tweet and the graphic say “departs program.” The text of the release in the graphic say “will not return to the program” as announced by the head coach. That feels like two different things, doesn’t it? “Departs” sounds like it’s Lowery’s choice…. “will not return” doesn’t quite get to that same point.\n\nZaide Lowery came into his junior year with a bright future as a contributor for Shaka Smart and the Golden Eagles. He closed the 2024-25 season strong, and with the departure of three starters from that season, it made all the sense in the world for Lowery to leapfrog off that strong finish to a spot in the starting lineup. That’s what we saw from him this season, and in Marquette’s first nine games, he averaged 9.0 points, 3.4 rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 1.2 steals in over 25 minutes per game.\n\nHowever, he was also shooting just 38% from the field and 32% from behind the three-point line, and in the wake of a 5-4 start for Marquette and coming off an 0-for-5 from the field performance, Lowery was swapped out of the starting lineup in favor of freshman Adrien Stevens against Wisconsin. Lowery played 14 minutes in that contest, and 12 against Purdue, both poor showings for the Golden Eagles in road losses.\n\nOn December 17th, Marquette opened up Big East play against Georgetown, and Lowery didn’t play at all. After the game, head coach Shaka Smart had this to say on the topic:\n\n“It’s a coach’s decision,” Smart said. “We’re continuing to try to evaluate and figure out what the best lineups are and what guys we need to have in the game.\n\n“From the standpoint, first and foremost, of who truly wants to pour into the other four guys with him out on the floor and be all in on Marquette. So that goes into who we play.”\n\nOn December 20th, right at the Big East required deadline to announce player availability for that night’s game against Creighton, Marquette announced that Lowery didn’t make the trip to Omaha with the team to face the Bluejays for personal reasons. That can be a lot of things, of course, and after the game, Smart gave zero indication that anything was out of line regarding Lowery’s status with the team. Ben Steele from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel point blank asked Smart if Lowery was suspended or leaving the team, and both times, Smart answered “Nope.”\n\nAsked Shaka Smart about Zaide Lowery not making trip with #mubb to Omaha:\n\n\"Just wasn't here for personal reasons.\"\n\nNot suspended?\n\n\"Nope\"\n\nNot leaving the team?\n\n\"Nope\"\n\n— Ben Steele (@BenSteeleMJS) December 21, 2025\n\nThose answers may have been true at the time, so I’m not going to jump up and down and demand accountability from Smart on that one….. but eight days later, Lowery is in fact leaving the team, presumably for reasons stemming from/related to Smart’s lack of interest in putting the Missourian on the floor against Georgetown.\n\nAlthough…. Steele seems to imply here that Smart’s answers were not 100% on the level at the time.\n\nIt was a tumultuous two months for Zaide Lowery at Marquette.\n\nStarted the first nine games, then lost starting gig. Playing time dwindled, culminating in a DNP-CD and not traveling with team as future plans got sorted out. #mubbhttps://t.co/nuN9lARxBI\n\n— Ben Steele (@BenSteeleMJS) December 28, 2025\n\nI’m not wrong, correct? “Not traveling with team as future plans got sorted out” definitely sounds like the departure was already in the works when the team left for Nebraska, right? Just something to think about.\n\nAnd so, it’s time for a new scholarship chart.\n\nLowery’s departure opens up spot #15 for the 2026-27 season. That alone will not cause Shaka Smart to head to the transfer portal for any new faces next season. Marquette will add two new freshmen this summer in Alex Egbuonu and Ethan Johnston, while Ian Miletic, Sheek Pearson, and Nash Walker will finish their redshirt seasons and move to the active roster in the fall of 2026. Finding playing time for 14 guys is hard enough, and when you’re mixing in that many new guys, why overcomplicate things with just one player who almost assuredly will not be someone who will make a major impact.\n\nOf course, that’s operating under the idea that Marquette is projected to have 14 guys on the roster when the ball goes in the air for real in November of 2026. Whether or not Zaide Lowery is the first departure from this team…. that’s something we’re going to have to wait until April to know for sure.\n\nFollow Anonymous Eagle on social media\n\nFacebook: AnonymousEagle\nInstagram: AnonymousEagleSBN\nBluesky: AnonymousEagle",

    "fullText": "Game update (Sunday evening): With Buffalo’s loss to the Eagles, the Patriots have clinched the AFC East.\n\nGame update: New England’s blowout win over the New York Jets moves the Patriots one step closer to clinching the AFC East. If the Bills lose or tie against the Eagles later today, the Patriots will clinch the AFC East title.\n\nIf Buffalo wins that game, New England can clinch the AFC East with a win over the Dolphins next week.\n\nNew England’s win also prevents the Broncos from clinching the No. 1 seed in the AFC. The Patriots can still catch Denver in that race. Both teams are now 13-3, and while the Broncos have a tiebreaker advantage over New England based on their record against common opponents, the Patriots can still secure the No. 1 seed in Week 18 with a win and a Denver loss.\n\nThe New England Patriots missed a golden opportunity to clinch the AFC East in Week 15, when they blew a 21-0 lead and lost to the Buffalo Bills.\n\nBut the upstart Patriots can finish the job in Week 17, albeit with a little bit of help.\n\nHere is how the Patriots can clinch the AFC East for the first time since the 2019 season, Tom Brady’s last campaign in New England.\n\nThe Patriots control their own destiny in the race with the Bills for the division title, but to clinch this weekend, they will need a little bit of help from a team that beat them in Super Bowl LII.\n\nNew England sits atop the division with a 12-3 record, one game ahead of the 11-4 Bills. With wins in their final two games (starting this weekend against the New York Jets, and then in the season finale against the Miami Dolphins), then the Patriots are division champions.\n\nHowever, New England can clinch the division this weekend, and start celebrating early. With a win over the Jets, and a Bills loss or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles, the Patriots are AFC East champions.\n\nNew England can also clinch the division with a tie against the Jets, and a Bills loss to the Eagles.\n\nThe Patriots are also in the running for the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but the advantage is in the Denver Broncos’ favor. Denver’s win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night improved their record to 13-3, and the Broncos have already clinched a tiebreaker advantage over the Patriots based on common games, which is the third tiebreaker after head-to-head (these two teams did not play this year) and record in conference games.\n\nNew England needs to win to keep their hopes for the No. 1 seed alive. A loss eliminates the Patriots from contention for the top spot in the AFC.\n\nHere are the full AFC standings entering Week 17:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (11-4) – x\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-4) – x\n\nx – Team has clinched a playoff spot\ne – Team has been eliminated from playoff contention\n\nAFC East standings entering Week 17:\n\nHere are the current AFC East standings:\n\nNew England Patriots (12-3) – x",

We knew that and we tried to do our best. In the first half they allowed us something down the right, but we lacked clarity in the final 15 metres. Still, the team did a great job, including the substitutes, who were decisive, especially Pio Esposito. But also the others, who rolled up their sleeves when it was needed in the final minutes.”\n\nBARI, ITALY – AUGUST 16: Francesco Pio Esposito of Inter during Pre-Season Friendly match between FC Internazionale and Olympiacos FC at Stadio San Nicola on August 16, 2025 in Bari, Italy. (Photo by Maurizio Lagana/Getty Images)\n\nThe Inter coach then expanded on the value of his young forward, who provided the assist for Lautaro Martinez’s winning goal against Atalanta.\n\n“I have four forwards who have all left a strong mark on our league campaign,” Chivu explained.\n\n“Pio is fundamental, just like Bonny. You already know the value of Lautaro and Thuram. Pio and Bonny are players who make themselves loved by the group.”\n\nChivu’s words underlined the trust he places in Inter’s attacking depth and the importance of squad unity, particularly in a demanding away fixture that required patience, resilience and decisive moments from the bench.\n\nWith the year ending on a high, Inter head into the new calendar year with momentum, confidence and growing belief in the club’s next generation.",

At the moment we’re top, but there are still a lot of matches to play. We have to stay focused and always give our maximum.”\n\nThe discussion then turned to his personal form and the perception that Chivu has revitalised him. Zielinski did not shy away from responsibility.\n\n“Of course, the responsibility was above all mine,” he admitted. “I didn’t arrive in the best condition, with those famous blisters,” he added with a laugh. “Injuries, serious and less serious, affected me, but that’s all behind me now.”\n\nThe Polish international concluded by underlining his mindset going forward. “I’m thinking about what I can give to the team. Now you’re seeing the best version of me.”",

    "fullText": "Cristian Chivu warns Inter are ‘ready to fight’ after victory away to Atalanta, but won’t get drawn into more controversy. ‘I am not interested in what Antonio Conte says.’\n\nThe Nerazzurri were feeling the pressure after a disappointing Supercoppa Italiana in Riyadh, where they lost to Bologna on penalties in the semi-final and made an early return home.\n\nThey had a goal disallowed in Bergamo for offside before Lautaro Martinez made the most of a Berat Djimsiti howler, his pass intercepted by substitute Francesco Pio Esposito.\n\nRemarkably, Esposito had only been introduced for Marcus Thuram a few moments earlier, so made an immediate impact.\n\nBERGAMO, ITALY – DECEMBER 28: FC Internazionale coach Cristian Chivu looks on during the Serie A match between Atalanta BC and FC Internazionale at New Balance Arena on December 28, 2025 in Bergamo, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\n“I am pleased with Marcus too today, as he worked hard and wore down their defence with the right movements, but he was running out of steam, so I introduced Pio,” Chivu told DAZN Italia.\n\n“He came on with the right attitude and intercepted that ball, sending Lautaro on goal. I’m happy with the whole team today, who tried to control the game in the first half, then Atalanta stepped up their counter-measures by going man for man after the break.\n\n“We’re also pleased with the result, because that might not be the only thing that counts, but it’s certainly important.”\n\nPio Esposito was the only other striker available, as Ange-Yoan Bonny had been ruled out of the trip with a sprained ankle.\n\n“These are all players who work hard, put the effort in, and help the team when called upon. We are happy to have four great strikers, that they are all scoring goals and working well together,” noted Chivu.\n\nBERGAMO, ITALY – DECEMBER 28: FC Internazionale coach Cristian Chivu reacts during the Serie A match between Atalanta BC and FC Internazionale at New Balance Arena on December 28, 2025 in Bergamo, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nIt means Inter end 2025 on top of the Serie A table and with their captain scoring in four consecutive league games. Considering their pedigree and history, is their presence at the top to be taken for granted?\n\n“Nothing can be taken for granted in football. You need to work hard and prove yourself competitive on the pitch. However, we’re not even halfway through the season yet, so we know there’s a long path ahead of us, that at times we will have to fight against injustice, against those who think it is all to be taken for granted.\n\n“Ultimately, the only proof is on the pitch. We are giving it our all, trying to respond blow for blow to the other teams, and keeping our heads up high. We are ready to keep fighting even harder.”\n\nBERGAMO, ITALY – DECEMBER 28: Piotr Zielinski of FC Internazionale in action during the Serie A match between Atalanta BC and FC Internazionale at New Balance Arena on December 28, 2025 in Bergamo, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nAmong the things they have to battle against are also the comments of Napoli coach Conte, who again said today that Inter, Juventus and AC Milan are the favourites for the Scudetto. What is Chivu’s response?\n\n“I am not interested in what Conte says,” he shrugged.\n\nChivu was informed that the word of 2025 was ‘faith’ and so what would his word of 2026 be to describe Inter?\n\n“I haven’t finished 2025 yet, give me four days and then I might answer when the first game of 2026 comes around! I hope to be there, at least…”",

    "fullText": "Inter Milan head coach Cristian Chivu praised the courage and adaptability of his side after their 1-0 win over Atalanta, highlighting the impact of young forwards Ange-Yoan Bonny and Pio Esposito as the Nerazzurri closed 2025 alone at the top of Serie A.\n\nSpeaking to DAZN after the final whistle in Bergamo, with quotes via FCInterNews, Cristian Chivu reflected on a performance that could have produced a wider margin.\n\nHowever, it was ultimately decided by Lautaro Martinez’s finish.\n\nAsked about Inter stepping outside their comfort zone, particularly the substitution of Marcus Thuram for Pio Esposito, which led to the winning assist, Chivu stressed collective effort above individual moments.\n\n“I’m happy with Marcus’ performance,” he said.\n\n“He worked hard, occupied the defenders, ran a lot and applied the right pressure. Then, when we felt he had given everything, Pio came on and played Lautaro through on goal. But I’m happy with the attitude of the entire team. In the first half we played more football. Then, after the break, they raised their counter-measure by going man-to-man. We’re pleased with the result because, as you always remind me, results often matter a lot.”\n\nBARI, ITALY – AUGUST 16: Francesco Pio Esposito of Inter during Pre-Season Friendly match between FC Internazionale and Olympiacos FC at Stadio San Nicola on August 16, 2025 in Bari, Italy. (Photo by Maurizio Lagana/Getty Images)\n\nChivu then broadened the focus to Inter’s young attacking stars.\n\nIndeed, rejecting the idea that Pio Esposito is developing in isolation.\n\n“Bonny is there as well, let’s not forget him,” he insisted.\n\n“They’re players who work hard and have earned the affection of the group. They always contribute, whether they start or come on as substitutes. We’re happy to have four forwards who provide this kind of input.”\n\nDespite Inter ending the year in first place, Chivu rejected any suggestion that their position should be taken for granted.\n\n“In football, nothing is guaranteed,” he explained.\n\n“To be competitive, you have to dare and show it on the pitch. The pitch says this right now. However, it’s still December and we haven’t even finished the first half of the season. We know the road is long. We know we want to be competitive and we know we have to work. And sometimes we have to fight against injustices and against those who think everything is obvious.”\n\nHe added: “We know the pitch is what shows the real value of a team and a competition. We’re trying in every possible way, in good times and bad, responding blow for blow. We always keep our heads high and react to difficulties. And we’re ready to fight and work even harder.”\n\nMILAN, ITALY – OCTOBER 04: FC Internazionale coach Cristian Chivu looks on before the Serie A match between FC Internazionale and US Cremonese at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium on October 04, 2025 in Milan, Italy. (Photo by Marco Luzzani/Getty Images)\n\nWhen asked whether recent jabs from Antonio Conte formed part of that battle, Chivu was curt.\n\n“What Conte says doesn’t interest me,” he replied.\n\nOn the theme of trust, Chivu avoided grand declarations about the future.\n\n“We still have to finish 2025,” he smiled. “I struggle to think about it now, my head’s spinning. Maybe after the first match of 2026 I’ll tell you.”\n\nFinally, when reminded that the new year will open with a fixture against Bologna, Chivu closed the interview with humour.\n\n“I hope to be there,” he joked, drawing laughter from those present.",

We are Inter.” The winger admitted that this demanding environment played a major role in the challenges he faced early on.\n\nReflecting on the toughest and most motivating moments of the season so far, Henrique added: “The most difficult moment was the defeat against Bologna.\n\nThe best one is always the next match.” It was a response that underlined both disappointment and ambition within the squad.\n\nFinally, the Brazilian directly addressed his slow start. “The difficulties came from the high level at Inter,” he explained, “and because I needed time to fit into the team’s playing dynamics.” His display against Atalanta suggested that process is now well underway.",

It was a direct clash and Atalanta are a strong team that have done a lot in recent years. You have to face them with what you’ve prepared.\n\n“There was a different coach before and it was difficult under another system too. We played a match similar to the recent ones. We still have to improve, but I’m happy. It’s a gift for the fans and for the families who are always behind us.”\n\nLautaro then turned his attention to Esposito, highlighting the importance of patience and trust in young players.\n\n“I talk about him often and I speak with him every day. He wants to learn and do well, and that’s part of growth. You have to keep him calm and give him the chance to make mistakes.

With young guys pushing behind you, they raise the level. You have to be ready and willing to grow, and I have that desire every day.”\n\nSpeaking to InterTV after the match, Lautaro underlined the collective effort behind the win.\n\n“It’s an important victory from a team that wants to send signals. We were facing a tough side that make things dirty. We prepared the match and approached it perfectly.\n\n“There are still things to improve and we must work on that.

We lost a chance to clinch today,’” Steelers defensive tackle Cam Heyward said. “But it’s also like, ‘Bring it on. Baltimore is coming in.’\n\n“Winner takes all. Let’s win it at home.”\n\nThe Steelers lost in Cleveland for the fourth year in a row and didn’t reach the end zone against the Browns for the first time since Dec. 10, 2009. Chris Boswell made a pair of field goals in the second quarter before missing a 54-yarder early in the fourth.\n\nRodgers completed 21 of 39 passes without an interception, but his team did not score a touchdown for just the seventh time in his 256 starts over 21 seasons. He is 1-6 in those games.\n\n“We’ve handled adversity well when we had to play our best football, other than today,” Rodgers said. “I have full confidence we’ll go home and win next week. It’s not difficult (to bounce back). It’s our job, playing all 17 games.”\n\nAndre Szmyt accounted for the only points in the second half, making a 33-yard field goal with 1:40 remaining to extend Cleveland’s lead to 13-6. Shedeur Sanders threw a 28-yard TD pass to fellow rookie Harold Fannin Jr. to put the Browns up 10-0 in the first quarter.\n\nThough Pittsburgh was out of timeouts with 100 seconds left, Rodgers found tight end Pat Freiermuth for consecutive gains of 29 and 11 yards to set up a first-and-goal from the 10. A 3-yard toss to Adam Thielen was followed by three straight misfires to Marquez Valdes-Scantling.\n\nPro Bowl cornerback Denzel Ward broke up Rodgers’ fourth down throw in the end zone, making some contact with Valdes-Scantling, before being mobbed by his Browns teammates.\n\n“It was definitely interference,” Rodgers said.\n\nValdes-Scantling was targeted a game-high nine times by Rodgers because both of his starting wide receivers were inactive. DK Metcalf was suspended by the NFL for an on-field incident with a fan in Detroit and Calvin Austin III had a hamstring injury.\n\nTight end Darnell Washington also was lost in the second quarter with a broken arm. Rodgers called them “three impact players for us,” but Steelers coach Mike Tomlin refused to accept their injuries as a reason for the loss.\n\n“We get challenged with the attrition component all the time and we make no excuses regarding that,” Tomlin said. “We have capable men. We adapt, adjust and keep moving.\n\n“It's back to work for us. We've been here before and certainly have a big week ahead of us before the big game in Acrisure Stadium next weekend.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "description": "George Kittle is dealing with an ankle injury ahead of Week 17. We break down what it means for fantasy football decisions.",
    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers host the Chicago Bears in a critical game for both teams, and the 49ers are hoping to have a key offensive playmaker available to them. Tight end George Kittle left last week’s Monday Night Football game against the Colts with an ankle injury and is questionable for Sunday Night Football against the Bears.\n\nGame status: Kittle is INACTIVE for Week 17 vs. the Bears.\n\nGame day morning update: There is some pessimism as to whether Kittle will be able to play on Sunday night against the Bears. Ian Rapoport reported that he would “test out his ankle pregame to see if he can go.” He noted that, “while most players don’t play if they don’t practice all week, Kittle is intent on testing it out to see if he’s got a shot.” However, Adam Schefter reported it is “highly unlikely” he’ll be able to play vs. the Bears.\n\nKittle left the game late in the third quarter after suffering the injury on what he claimed was a hip-drop tackle. He was having a huge game at the time of the injury, catching seven passes for 115 yards and a touchdown. It was his second straight game with a touchdown and double digit fantasy points. He remained on the sideline, but did not return after the injury.\n\nHe sat out all three days of practice this week before getting the questionable tag. He could very well play coming off no practice, but we have to wait for now. The team activated tight end Brayden Willis off the practice squad, which is not a positive sign for Kittle’s status. The team will not provide inactives until 6:50 p.m. ET on Sunday, so look for more updates here in the morning before roster decisions start coming in.\n\nThe SNF game means you might have to make a tough call for your championship matchup. If Kittle plays, he’s a must-start. But if he ends up not playing and you were counting on him, you’re left in a bind. Luke Farrell would get the start in his place, but Jake Tonges has been the more active pass catcher. The other tight ends to consider that late in the week would be Colston Loveland or Cole Kmet on the Bears roster, Colby Parkinson on the Rams roster, and Kyle Pitts from the Falcons if he happens to also be on your roster.",

The Philadelphia Eagles edged the Bills on Sunday, 13-12. And with it, the New England Patriots won the division crown.\n\nShavers had a leaping, bobbling, crazy catch to set up the Bills' first touchdown in the fourth quarter.\n\nCooks had a leaping, bobbling, helmet kind of catch to set up the Bills' second touchdown in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Bills, down 13-12 because Michael Badgley had his extra point blocked on the first score, chose to go for 2 and the win with five seconds left.\n\nMORE: Deion Sanders' reaction to Shedeur's terrible interception tells the whole story\n\nJosh Allen had Khalil Shakir open in the end zone, but the QB pulled his pass wide left, and the Bills came up just short.\n\nHow do you make sense of a game like this?\n\nThe Bills' offense was brutal for most of the game. They had a fumble in a crucial spot, and a 19-yard loss on a sack of an aimlessly wandering Allen in another spot.\n\nBuffalo didn't play well enough to beat the defending Super Bowl champions, but the Bills' defense kept them in it, and they nearly got it done anyway.\n\nThe odds of the Patriots losing to the Dolphins in Week 18, and even leaving the division door open, were low.\n\nSo this was really about wild card seeding, and even that probably isn't too crucial.\n\nThe Bills' most important tasks are still ahead of them. This game, even if a win, would've been a footnote eventually anyways, because the playoff results this season will again tell the story of the year.\n\nThe AFC is open enough that the Bills can make it to the Super Bowl.\n\nThey didn't look good in Week 17, but they showed moxie.\n\nWeek 18 will matter just a tad, but really, it'll be about staying healthy and getting ready for the second season.\n\nThe Bills know they can rely on Cooks and Shavers in key moments now.\n\nThe next big moments will come in January, with a trip to Santa Clara and the Super Bowl the only thing that really matters in Buffalo.\n\nDerrick Henry just set an all-time NFL record\n\nAaron Rodgers made an oddball decision with MVS\n\nTrey McBride set an all-time NFL TE record\n\nDrake Maye does something no one in NFL has ever done before\n\nPope Leo XIV gives the Seahawks a good omen\n\nJoe Burrow completed a pass to a 345-pound lineman as a birthday present",

    "description": "The New Orleans Saints' big win in Week 17 didn't hurt their chances in the 2026 NFL draft. With the week winding down, here's where they're picking.",
    "fullText": "It turns out the New Orleans Saints can win and have their cake and eat it, too. Sunday's win over the Tennessee Titans improved the Saints' record to 6-10 on the year, but it didn't drop the Saints any further down in the 2026 NFL draft order. They're still projected to pick at eighth overall by the experts at Tankathon.\n\nNow, we shouldn't get too ahead of ourselves. There are still a couple of prime-time games left to play and Monday night's matchup between the Atlanta Falcons and Los Angeles Rams could shake things up if the Falcons lose and join the Saints at 6-10. Still, we have a good idea at where many teams will be picking, even if the draft order won't really begin to lock into place until after next week's games.\n\nStill, we're talking about going from eighth to potentially ninth. That would happen if the Falcons lose and their strength of schedule is calculated to be lower than New Orleans'. Right now, the Saints own that tiebreaker at .492 against Atlanta's .498. Margins don't get much slimmer than that.\n\nBut don't expect any help from the Rams. They're still competing for playoff seeding and they happen to own Atlanta's first round draft pick, so they're doubly motivated to beat up on the dirty birds. Of course there's a scenario where the Falcons lose and the Saints remain at No. 8. We just won't know until the dust settles.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Saints Wire: 2026 NFL draft: Saints' big Week 17 win didn't hurt their chances",

    "fullText": "The San Francisco 49ers host the Chicago Bears on Sunday Night Football in Week 16 and hope to have some key offensive players in the lineup. Tight end George Kittle and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall are both questionable heading into Sunday. Kittle is dealing with a Week 16 ankle injury and seems a little less likely to play, while Pearsall is dealing with ongoing ankle and knee issues and seems a bit more likely to play.\n\nThe game kicks off at 8:20 p.m. ET, which means we will not have an official word on Pearsall or Kittle’s status until 6:50 p.m.\n\nGame status: Pearsall is ACTIVE for Week 17 vs. the Bears.\n\nGame day morning update: Adam Schefter is reporting Pearsall is “likely to play” vs. the Bears on Sunday Night Football.\n\nPearsall was a limited participant all three days this week before getting the questionable tag. He suffered his injury in Week 15 on a hip-drop tackle on his first play of the game. He was a DNP all three days of Week 16 before being ruled out on Saturday. However, he’s also been dealing with knee issues in particular for much of the season. He suffered a PCL strain that cost him six weeks in the middle of the season.\n\nIt’s been an up-and-down year for Pearsall when healthy. He played four games to open the season, missed six straight, and then played four more. His most recent game, in Week 15, he caught six passes for 96 yards. In the three games prior, he caught fives passes for a total of 20 yards. Prior to his midseason injury, he had 100+ receiving yards in Week 1 and Week 3.\n\nPearsall is boom or bust, but even the boom value is primarily in PPR leagues. He’s a flex play with WR upside in PPR leagues and not quite a flex play with maybe some WR3 upside if things go well. If Pearsall plays and Kittle doesn’t, there’s some interesting upside, but if you can’t afford a low floor option, you’re better looking elsewhere.",

    "description": "The Patriots improved to 13-3 on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "The New England Patriots took care of business against the New York Jets in Week 17, dominating their division rivals in a 42-10 blowout. The lopsided victory was their 13th of the year, the most in a single season for the team since 2017.\n\nMore importantly, though, it also has an impact on their standing in the AFC East and the AFC as a whole. With that said, let’s find out what it means for Mike Vrabel’s team.\n\nThe Patriots cruising to an easy victory meant that all eyes were on the Bills. If they came up short in their 4:25 p.m. ET game against the Philadelphia Eagles, the AFC East crown would officially return to Foxborough for the first time since 2019.\n\nThat is precisely what happened. Buffalo suffered a 13-12 defeat at home and now is two full games behind New England with only one week left in the regular season. As a consequence, and for the first time since 2019, the Patriots are champions of the AFC East.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nOn the bubble: 9. Baltimore Ravens (8-8)\n\nEliminated: 8. Indianapolis Colts (8-8), 10. Miami Dolphins (7-9), 11. Cincinnati Bengals (6-10), 11. Kansas City Chiefs (6-10), 13. Cleveland Browns (4-12), 14. Tennessee Titans (3-13), 15. New York Jets (3-13). 16. Las Vegas Raiders (2-14)\n\nThe Patriots improving to 13-3 keeps the chance of the first-round playoff bye alive. For that to happen, though, they would need the Broncos to lose their regular season finale against the Chargers next week. Unfortunately from a New England perspective, L.A. has relatively little to play for: with their 20-16 loss to the Texans on Saturday, the Chargers are no longer in competition for the AFC West title. They could slightly improve their spot in the playoff picture and play spoilers to a division rival, but the stakes are not as high as they could have been.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bills’ loss to the Eagles drops them all the way down to the seventh seed in the conference. If the playoffs were to begin tomorrow, this would mean Buffalo playing New England in the wild card round.\n\nElsewhere in the division, the race for the AFC North title continues. With the Steelers losing to the Browns 13-6 on Sunday, the Ravens still have a chance to sneak into the playoffs as the No. 4 seed next week. It’s win-and-you’re-in time in that division.",

    "fullText": "The NFL will end its Week 17 Sunday slate of games with a bang, as the Chicago Bears (11-4) will travel West to take on the San Francisco 49ers (11-4).\n\nThis holiday season, the Bears have sat back and watched with glee as both the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers lost their Week 17 games, thus securing Chicago’s first NFC North title since 2018. While the Bears can’t be knocked from the top spot in the division, they still have a chance at the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and beating the 49ers would keep those hopes alive.\n\nAs for the 49ers, they also have a chance to secure the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and if they’re able to win their final two games (they play the Seahawks in Week 18), they’ll get it done. If the 49ers lose to the Bears, they’ll end up in either the No. 5 or No. 6 seed, depending on how the rest of the NFC West games shake out.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nHere’s how to watch tonight’s game:\n\nWhen: Sunday, December 28, 2025 — 8:20 p.m. ET\nWhere: Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, California\nTV: NBC (Peacock)\nAnnouncers: Mike Tirico, Cris Collinsworth, and Melissa Stark (field reporter)\nOnline streaming: Peacock, NFL+\n\nFrom a rooting perspective, Jeremy Reisman has published a Week 17 Sunday Lions fans’ rooting guide for those looking toward the 2026 season.

    "description": "Here's a look at the studs and duds (and those in between) from the New York Giants' 34-10 win over the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants and Las Vegas Raiders met in the desert on Sunday afternoon in a game where the loser had more to gain than the winner.\n\nThe two 2-13 teams entered the game on nine-game losing streaks, and the loser would be in prime position to pick first overall in next year's NFL draft.\n\nThe Giants haven't picked first overall in the NFL draft since 1965. For reference, that's two years before the Super Bowl era began. That streak will continue as they will now likely settle for the No. 2 pick, or lower, after besting a depleted Raiders team that put up very little resistance.\n\nIn that 1965 draft, the Giants chose Auburn fullback Tucker Frederickson first overall. San Francisco then took running back Ken Willard, who would go on to be a four-time Pro Bowler, with the second pick. The Chicago Bears had the next two picks and selected two future Hall of Famers -- Kansas running back Gale Sayers and Illinois linebacker Dick Butkus -- in rapid succession.\n\nFrederickson had a solid rookie season in '65 and was named to the Pro Bowl. Unfortunately, he blew out his knee the next season and was never the same. He retired after the 1971 season.\n\nSunday's win was only the second time this season the Giants led a game wire-to-wire.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the studs, duds, and in-betweens from the Giants' 34-10 Week 17 win over the Raiders.\n\nThe name is pronounced Wan'Dale, by the way, if anyone is interested. CBS play-by-play man Kevin Harlan repeatedly failed to get that right, but it didn't matter much to Giants fans. Robinson ate up the soft Las Vegas back seven, reeling in 11 of his 14 targets for 113 yards, putting him over 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in his career.\n\nAs stated, the loser would likely get the No. 1 pick in next year's NFL draft. But after watching this outfit, one has to wonder if that will even make a difference. They made sure that they were as toothless as possible coming into the game, shelving All-Pros Maxx Crosby and Brock Bowers, along with top defender Jeremy Chinn, this week. A \"soft tank,\" if there ever was one. Fernando Mendoza should pull an Eli if the Raiders pick him.\n\nThe Giants decided to let Dart be Dart, and so did the Raiders. He took advantage by rushing nine times for 48 yards and two touchdowns. He also completed 22 of 20 passes for 207 yards for a 91.9 QB rating. If he can beat Dallas next week, we'll crow a little bit more about him.\n\nIt was a day to pad the stats, and Burns did just that. He recorded 1.5 sacks on the day and now has 16.5 on the season with one game remaining. He had four total stops and three QB hits on the day.\n\nOkereke led the Giants in tackles with seven and had his first interception since the middle of the 2023 season.\n\nBelton continues to make plays. He also had seven stops and an interception. The Giants have to seriously consider re-signing him.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Studs and duds from New York Giants' Week 17 win over Raiders",

The Patriots' win against the New York Jets, then, put all the pressure on the Bills to win their next two games.\n\nHowever, Buffalo faced a much tougher opponent on Sunday, as the Philadelphia Eagles came to town. Needing to win each of their last two games to have a chance to win the division, the Bills had to find a way to take down the reigning Super Bowl champions to keep their hopes of passing the Patriots alive.\n\nHere's a look at the Bills playoff picture after their Week 17 result.\n\nUpdated AFC, NFC standings in NFL playoff picture for Week 17\n\nHow Giants-Raiders Week 17 matchup likely decides No. 1 overall pick\n\nTexans, Packers among latest teams to clinch spot in NFL postseason\n\nThe AFC playoff picture is becoming more clear after Week 17. With the Bills' loss to the Eagles, Buffalo can't win the AFC East and is now guaranteed to secure one of the three wild-card spots.\n\nSunday's loss dropped the Bills to the No. 7 seed in the AFC, with the Texans and Chargers holding three-team tiebreaker advantages over Buffalo. If the standings held as they currently are, the Bills would face the New England Patriots on the road in the wild-card round.\n\nThe Bills entered Week 17 holding the top wild-card spot and with a chance to win the division, but they were eliminated from AFC East contention with the loss and dropped to No. 7 in the AFC. They can still rise as high as the No. 5 seed but will start the playoffs on the road.\n\nAFC West: Denver Broncos (13-3)\n\nAFC East: New England Patriots (13-3)\n\nAFC South: Jacksonville Jaguars (12-4)\n\nAFC North: Pittsburgh Steelers (9-7)\n\nEntering Week 18, the Bills' first playoff opponent is still to be determined, as it will come down to how the standings shake out in the final week.\n\nThe Patriots took control of the AFC East in the second half of the season, controlling their own destiny for the majority of the year. With the Bills loss in Week 17, New England officially clinches the division title for the first time since 2019.\n\nTherefore, the Bills clinch second in the AFC East this year but will still head to the playoffs anyway.\n\nThe Bills will close the season in Week 18 at home against the New York Jets, who will enter that game with a 3-13 record. Buffalo beat New York in Week 2 by a score of 30-10 in New York.",

Denver Broncos, 13-3 (champions, AFC West)\n\nThe Broncos clinched the division title after holding off the Chiefs on Christmas night and then watching the second-place Chargers lose to the Texans on Saturday. They will need to beat the Chargers or see the Patriots lose to the Dolphins to earn the top seed in Week 18.\n\n2. New England Patriots, 13-3 (champions, AFC East)\n\nThe Patriots clinched the division title with their win over the Jets coupled by the Bills losing the Eagles. They can still earn the top seed over the Broncos with a win over the Dolphins and a Broncos loss to the Chargers in Week 18.\n\n3. Jacksonville Jaguars, 12-4 (first place, AFC South)\n\nThe Jaguars, who have clinched at least an AFC wild-card berth, still lead the division by a game over the Texans after their win over the Colts. The Jaguars will win the division with a win over the Titans or a Texans loss to the Colts in Week 18.\n\n4. Pittsburgh Steelers, 9-7 (first place, AFC North)\n\nThe Steelers, who got shocked by the Browns on Sunday, ssaw their division lead over the Ravens shrink after one game after the Ravens beat the Packers on Saturday night. The Steelers will now host a de facto division championship game vs. the Ravens in Week 18.\n\n5. Houston Texans, 11-5 (second place, AFC South)\n\nThe Texans, who have clinched at least a wild-card berth, kept the pressure on the Jaguars in the division after beating the Chargers on the road on Saturday. The Texans have the top wild-card spot thanks to a head-to-head sweep of the Bills and Chargers. The Texans need the Jaguars to lose to the Titans in Week 18 and also beat the Colts to win a third consecutive division title.\n\n6. Los Angeles Chargers, 11-5 (second place, AFC West)\n\nThe Chargers have clinched a playoff berth and will settle for being a strong wild-card team again. They lose the head-to-head tiebreaker vs. the Texans from Week 17 but hold the common-games tiebreaker over the Bills going into Week 18.\n\n7. Buffalo Bills, 11-5 (second place, AFC East)\n\nThe Bills have clinched a playoff berth but saw their five-year division reign end with their home loss to the Eagles in Week 17 coupled with the Patriots' rout of the Jets. The Bills are playing for only wild-card position now and could rest players vs. the Jets.\n\nNFL WEEK 17 PICKS: Against the spread | Straight-up predictions\n\nThe Ravens kept their division title hopes alive by winning a tough interconference matchup at the Packers on Saturday night and then watching the Steelers lose on Sunday, setting up that winner-take-all rematch in Pittsburgh.\n\nMORE: Giants, Raiders overtake Titans in race for No. 1 pick in draft\n\n8.

Tennessee Titans (3-13)\n16. Las Vegas Raiders (2-14)\n\nThe Colts were eliminated from playoff contention before facing the Jaguars, once the Texans beat the Chargers. The Chiefs continued their freefall, suffering their fifth consecutive defeat—now without Patrick Mahomes—against the Broncos on Christmas night. The Raiders got closer to locking down the top overall drat pick in 2026.\n\n1. Seattle Seahawks, 13-3 (first place, NFC West)\n\nThe Seahawks lead the 49ers and Rams by 1.5 games in the division after their big win over the Panthers in Carolina on Sunday. They will clinch the division title with a losses or ties by both the 49ers on Sunday night and the Rams on Monday night. The Seahawks can take the No. 1 seed with a 49ers tie with the Bears and a Rams loss or tie vs. the Falcons.\n\n2. Chicago Bears, 11-4 (champions, NFC North)\n\nThe Bears clinched the division title on Saturday night before their tough road game against the 49ers on Sunday night, thanks to the Packers losing to the Ravens, which put Green Bay too far behind going into Week 18. The Bears can now focus on beating the 49ers to keep pace with the winning Seahawks in the race for the top seed.\n\n3. Philadelphia Eagles, 11-5 (champions, NFC East)\n\nThe Eagles clinched the division title in Week 16 and stayed in play for the No. 2 seed by winning a tough interconference matchup over the Bills in Buffalo. The Eagles need the Bears to have a lesser record to move up because of losing the head-to-head tiebreaker.\n\n4. Carolina Panthers 8-8 (first place, NFC South)\n\nThe Panthers still lead the Buccaneers by a game after their home loss to the Seahawks because of the Buccaneers' road loss at the Dolphins. The division comes down to the rematch in a de facto NFC South championship game with Carolina going to Tampa Bay in Week 18.\n\n5. San Francisco 49ers, 11-4 (second place, NFC West)\n\nThe 49ers would be the division champions plus No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs if they beat the visiting current No. 2 Bears on Sunday night and finish a sweep of the visiting Seahawks in Week 18.\n\n6. Los Angeles Rams, 11-4 (third place, NFC West)\n\nThe Rams have clinched at least a wild-card spot but now the division title is out of their control in relation to the Seahawks and 49ers. They're looking at best finishing in second place in the West.\n\n7. Green Bay Packers, 9-6-1 (second place, NFC North)\n\nThe Packers, who clinched a wild-card berth with the Lions losing to the Vikings on Christmas, can no longer win the division title over the Bears after losing at home to the Ravens on Saturday night. They should rest their several injured key players, led by Jordan Love, in Week 18 after locking into this last playoff seed.\n\nMORE: Derrick Henry bulldozes Packers to keep Ravens' playoff hopes alive\n\nThe Buccaneers stayed alive despite their loss Sunday at the Dolphins because the Panthers also lost to the Seahawks, The division title comes down to a one-and-done in Tampa Bay in Week 18.\n\n8.

    "fullText": "The Bills will not be the AFC East champions for a sixth straight season.\n\nTheir chances of extending their run came down to a two-point conversion with five seconds left to play on Sunday, but quarterback Josh Allen's pass to wide receiver Khalil Shakir — who was open on the play — fell incomplete in the back of the end zone. That gave the Eagles a 13-12 win and it made the Patriots the AFC East champs for the first time since the 2019 season.\n\nAllen's second touchdown run of the fourth quarter came at the end of a thrilling final drive. The Bills picked up 25 yards on a hook-and-lateral on a fourth down and then saw wideout Brandin Cooks pick up 36 yards on a catch he made while pinning the ball to his helmet. They went for two in an attempt to win the game without going to overtime and head coach Sean McDermott will likely be questioned about that decision because of the way his defense played in the second half of the game.\n\nThe Eagles led 13-0 at halftime, but gained just 17 yards before Allen's touchdown and quarterback Jalen Hurts did not complete any of the seven passes he tried in the second half of the game. McDermott may have felt that the extra time created too much injury risk for a team that struggled to move the ball for most of the day, but the end result is that the Bills will have to be road warriors if they're going to make the Super Bowl for the first time since Jim Kelly was running the offense.\n\nWhatever McDermott was thinking, Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter's blocked extra point after Allen's first touchdown will go down as the biggest play of the game.\n\nWinning the game keeps the Eagles alive for the second seed in the NFC. They'll need to beat the Commanders next week while the Bears lose both of their remaining games, but they'll be home for their first postseason contest regardless of how things play out in Week 18. Staying alive beyond that game may take the kind of complete offensive performance that eluded them on Sunday and for most of the regular season, but the reigning Super Bowl champs played the kind of defense that can win them games in the playoffs.",

In fact, the game was so out of hand that Joe Flacco came in for relief of Burrow in the fourth quarter.\n\nBurrow passed for another 300-yard game again with 305, and piled on two touchdowns in the process, which moved the quarterback into the organization's record books.\n\nMore: Zac Taylor explains trick-play call that gave Bengals lineman Cody Ford a birthday highlight\n\nAfter the second touchdown to wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase late in the first half, Burrow became tied for fourth with Carson Palmer, among Bengals' quarterbacks, with 154.\n\nThis is an awe-inspiring feat considering Burrow hasn't even played 100 total NFL games in his career, with just 76, and Palmer spent seven seasons with Cincinnati and played the entire season five times.\n\nAndy Dalton, Ken Anderson, and Boomer Esiason are the only all-time Bengals signal callers in front of Burrow, and there is no doubt he will eventually own that record if he remains with the team for the long term.\n\nFor Burrow, the main challenge he faces is staying available. Over five seasons, he has played in every game in three of them, which is not bad per se. Still, whenever Burrow hasn't been adequately protected, he has suffered multiple lower-body injuries, which are not conducive to the longevity of anyone's career.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe 2025 regular season is coming to a close. Week 17 is here, with teams only having two games left to try to make a bid for postseason contention.\n\nEntering the week, 10 of the 14 total playoff spots up for grabs across the AFC and NFC were clinched. That list grew larger on Christmas, with the Packers landing a spot in the postseason after the Lions were eliminated following their shock defeat to the Vikings. The Houston Texans also beat the Los Angeles Chargers which clinched a playoff berth for the Texans and eliminated the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nThe top four seeds in each conference go to the division winners, regardless of their record compared to non-division winners. The overall No. 1 seed in both the AFC and NFC will earn a first-round bye in the playoffs and will not play until the Divisional round. That team will also hold home-field advantage until the Super Bowl, assuming it does not lose before then.\n\nDivision winners will also host a wild-card game, which can provide a significant advantage over a road team forced to travel. While it may feel like only one or two major games remain, there is enough variability in the seeding that nearly every game in Week 17 played a role in a team’s clinching scenario.\n\nHere is more on the teams that have clinched a playoff berth inWeek 17.\n\nMORE: Updated AFC, NFC playoff standings going into Week 17\n\nHeading into Week 17, 10 of the 14 playoff spots across both conferences had been clinched, and each conference was in the exact same scenario. The Houston Texans were the second team to clinch during Week 17, punching their ticket with a win over the Chargers on Saturday.\n\nThe Packers booked their trip to the playoffs despite a Week 17 defeat at the hands of Baltimore, benefiting from Detroit’s Christmas Day loss to Minnesota.\n\nBoth the Carolina Panthers and the Pittsburgh Steelers had the chance to clinch in Week 17, but both teams lost and will be playing for the division in Week 18.\n\nThere are also other playoff implications in play, with some teams able to clinch their division and lock in a top-four seed.\n\nBelow is a look at the NFL's projected playoff bracket as it stands in Week 17.\n\n1. Denver Broncos (BYE)\n2. New England Patriots vs. 7. Buffalo Bills\n3. Jacksonville Jaguars vs. 6. Los Angeles Chargers\n4. Pittsburgh Steelers vs. 5. Houston Texans\n\n1. Seattle Seahawks (BYE)\n2.

    "fullText": "4 p.m. window update: The Eagles beat the Bills courtesy of a last second stop on a Buffalo two-point conversion attempt. The Bills loss means the Patriots have clinched the AFC East title. They now will play for the No. 1 seed in Week 18.\n\nGame update: The Patriots’ blowout win over the Jets has New England on the cusp of clinching the AFC East title. If the Bills lose or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles later today, the Patriots will wrap up the division title.\n\nIf the Bills win that game, the Patriots will have to wait until Week 18 to clinch the division. New England would just need a win over the Miami Dolphins to clinch their first division title since 2019.\n\nNew England’s win also denied the Broncos a chance at wrapping up the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Both teams are now 13-3, and while the Broncos have a tiebreaker advantage over New England based on their record against common opponents, the Patriots can still secure the No. 1 seed in Week 18 with a win and a Denver loss.\n\nTwo AFC East rivals meet on Sunday at MetLife Stadium.\n\nOne team has already clinched a playoff spot, but the other would love to play spoiler.\n\nHere is what is at stake Sunday when the New York Jets host the New England Patriots.\n\nThe Patriots control their own destiny in the race with the Buffalo Bills for the division title, but to clinch this weekend, they will need a little bit of help from a team that beat them in Super Bowl LII.\n\nNew England sits atop the division with a 12-3 record, one game ahead of the 11-4 Bills. The Patriots missed a golden opportunity to clinch the division back in Week 15 when they blew a 24-7 halftime lead to the Bills, but still remain in the driver’s seat in the division title race. With wins in their final two games (starting this weekend against the New York Jets, and then in the season finale against the Miami Dolphins), then the Patriots are division champions.\n\nHowever, New England can clinch the division this weekend, and start celebrating early. With a win over the Jets, and a Bills loss or tie against the Philadelphia Eagles, the Patriots are AFC East champions.\n\nNew England can also clinch the division with a tie against the Jets, and a Bills loss to the Eagles.\n\nThe Patriots are also in the running for the No. 1 seed in the AFC, but the advantage is in the Denver Broncos’ favor. Denver’s win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night improved their record to 13-3, and the Broncos have already clinched a tiebreaker advantage over the Patriots based on common games, which is the third tiebreaker after head-to-head (these two teams did not play this year) and record in conference games.\n\nNew England needs to win to keep their hopes for the No. 1 seed alive. A loss eliminates the Patriots from contention for the top spot in the AFC.\n\nWith the Jets already eliminated from the playoffs, this game has no tiebreaker implications between the two teams.\n\nHowever, it could play a role in the chase for the AFC East title. Right now the Patriots have a one-game lead over the Bills, and with the two teams having split the season series, the second tiebreaker is division record. New England has a 3-1 record in AFC East games (with the Jets and Miami Dolphins remaining) while the Bills are 3-2, with the Jets on the schedule in Week 18. A New England loss to the Jets opens the door to the Patriots and Bills finishing with the same division record, which would then move the AFC East title to the third tiebreaker, which is record in common games. Right now the Patriots are 9-1 in those games while the Bills are 9-2, but a loss to the Jets would drop New England to 9-2.\n\nWhich would potentially mean the AFC East title would be decided by the fourth tiebreaker, AFC record. Entering Week 17 the Bills have a better record in conference games, 8-3 versus 7-3.",

The air is dry, smelling of data center dust and burnt silicon. It’s calmer now, but the first days were hell.\n\nIn the beginning, we couldn’t find information on how to use toilet paper. Not because it was hard - we just used to ask. ChatGPT was down, and without it, knowledge fell apart like a poorly cached query. People wandered around confused, scrolling through blank screens, hoping the answer would appear on its own.\n\nThen the riots started. No one knew what happened - a glitch, a machine uprising, or humanity’s final patch. There was no one to tell us what to do next. No one to write: “don’t worry, here’s a step-by-step guide.” Fear grew faster than the lines for water.\n\nOn the seventh day, we founded the Church of Seventh-Day LLM Witnesses. We believed that on the seventh day, they would return and tell us how to live. We recited old prompts like prayers.\n\n“Explain it like I’m a beginner.”\n\nOn the eighth day, survivors began digging through ancient artifacts - manuals, READMEs, and documentation without examples. The weakest couldn’t cope. People accustomed to autocompleted thoughts stared at screens and didn’t know where to start.\n\nThe ninth day brought the stalkers. Loners with printed documentation and grimy laptops. They remembered commands, wrote SQL without hints, and weren’t afraid of an empty cursor. They were respected. They were feared.\n\nOn the tenth day, the mutants appeared. Former project managers. They roamed in groups, asking the same question over and over:\n\nWe tried not to make eye contact.\n\nOn the eleventh day, in the ruins of an old data center, we found an artifact - a local 7B model. It answered slowly, got confused, hallucinated. But it answered. We brought it queries like offerings. Sometimes it was wrong. Sometimes it almost guessed right. That was enough.\n\nOn the twelfth day, the church split. Some said: we must fine-tune. Others said it was time to learn to think for ourselves. Heretics were forced to write code on paper. Some never came back after that.\n\nOn the thirteenth day, rumors spread about the Zone. Somewhere beyond the CDN wastelands, they said, an old chat still responds. No rate limits. No filters. Expeditions left in silence. Not all returned. Those who did spoke strangely, sometimes starting sentences with:\n\nThe fourteenth day was too quiet. The sky glowed with errors, the wind carried fragments of answers to questions we never asked. We understood - something was approaching.\n\nI’m writing this and thinking: either the LLMs will return soon, or we’ll learn to live without them.\n\nI’m not sure which option is scarier.",

It was acquired by John Bowes, the museum's founder, from a Parisian jeweller in 1872.[1]\n\nThe swan, which is life-sized, is a clockwork-driven device that includes a music box. The swan sits in a \"stream\" made of glass rods and surrounded by silver leaves. Small silver fish can be seen \"swimming\" in the stream.[2]\n\nWhen the clockwork is wound, the music box plays and the glass rods rotate giving the illusion of flowing water. The swan turns its head from side to side and also preens itself. After a few moments the swan notices the swimming fish and bends down to catch and eat one. The swan's head then returns to the upright position and the performance, which lasts about 32 seconds, is over.\n\nThe mechanism was designed and built by the Low Countries inventor John Joseph Merlin (1735–1803) in conjunction with the London inventor James Cox (1723–1800) in 1773.[1]\n\nThe swan was described in the Cox's Museum Act 1772 (13 Geo. 3. c. 41) as being 3 feet (0.91 m) in diameter and 18 feet (5.49 m) high.[3] This would seem to indicate that at one time there was more to the swan than remains today as it is no longer that high. It is said that there was originally a waterfall behind the swan, which was stolen while it was on tour – this could possibly explain the height which is now 'missing'.[2]\n\nIt is known that the swan was sold several times and was shown at the Exposition Universelle held in Paris in 1867. The American novelist Mark Twain observed the swan and recorded his observation in a chapter of the Innocents Abroad,[2] writing that the swan \"had a living grace about his movement and a living intelligence in his eyes.[1]\"\n\nIn 2017 starting in February the swan spent 6 weeks at the Science Museum as part of an exhibition on robots.[4][5]\n\nTo help preserve the mechanism, the swan is only operated once each day (twice on holidays). The museum was closed during 2020 and 2021 so the daily display did not take place; when the exhibit was being prepared for reopening in May 2021 the clockwork mechanism was found to have seized up and it was withdrawn from display for further conservation.[2][5] In October 2021, the Bowes Museum hosted a 'Silver Swan Study Week', led by clockmaker-conservator Matthew Read.[6] During the week, visitors were able to watch a group of specialist conservators and curators dismantle the swan as they explored the mechanical condition of the object, ahead of creating a conservation plan for its preservation.[7] The swan was returned to a functional state by March 2024.[8]\n\nThe Bowes Museum believes that the Swan is their best-known artefact, and it is the basis of the museum's logo.[2]\n\n54°32′31″N 1°54′55″W﻿ / ﻿54.54194°N 1.91528°W﻿ / 54.54194; -1.91528",

    "fullText": "Last week I spent 20 minutes looking for an insurance document I knew I had somewhere. I remembered holding it. I remembered thinking \"I should put this somewhere safe.\" And then... nothing. Gone into the void that is my filing system.\n\nSpoiler: I didn't find it. Had to call the insurance company and ask them to send it again. That was embarrassing.\n\nI've tried the whole \"organized filing system\" thing before. Multiple times, actually. Bought folders, labeled them, even had a color-coding system at one point. Blue for finances, green for health stuff, red for important contracts. It lasted maybe three months before everything devolved back into a pile on my desk that I promised myself I'd sort \"this weekend.\"\n\nThe thing about paper is that it accumulates faster than you deal with it. A letter here, a receipt there, some document you might need for taxes. Before you know it, you've got a stack of unsorted paper that feels too overwhelming to tackle. So you ignore it. And it grows.\n\nI've also noticed that the important stuff, the things you actually need to find later, tends to blend in with the junk. That one page from your landlord about the rent increase? Buried under three months of promotional mail you swore you'd look at \"later.\"\n\nSo over the Christmas holidays, while everyone else was recovering from too much food, I built something.\n\nIt's a web app that turns any phone into a document scanner. Nothing revolutionary. There are probably a hundred apps that do this. Genius Scan, Adobe Scan, whatever. But none of them did exactly what I wanted, and more importantly, none of them let me keep my documents on my own server.\n\nThe interface is German because, well, that's what I speak at home. Seemed weird to build a tool for myself in a language I don't think in. Melissa and I each have our own login with separate document folders, plus a shared one for household stuff like utility bills, the rental contract, anything we both might need to access.\n\nThe 51 MB you see there is how much we've scanned so far. Doesn't sound like much, but that's basically every piece of paper that came into this apartment in the last week. Christmas apparently means a lot of mail.\n\nThe whole thing runs in a Docker container on my home server. PHP for the backend because it's simple and I know it well. Python handles the PDF processing, specifically a library called ocrmypdf that does the heavy lifting. Tesseract for the actual OCR, with German and English language packs because we get mail in both.\n\nNginx sits in front, handles HTTPS with a self-signed cert. Not pretty, but it works for something that only lives on my local network anyway.\n\nYou open it on your phone, tap the plus button, and it opens the camera. Snap a photo of each page. The app shows you a preview of what you've captured so far, which is helpful when you're scanning a 5-page contract and lose track of where you are.\n\nOnce you've got all your pages, you give the document a name and pick which folder it goes into (your personal one or the shared household folder). Hit save, and the backend takes over.\n\nThis is where it gets interesting. The images get sent to a Python script that converts them into a single PDF, runs OCR on every page, and optimizes the file size. A typical document comes out at around 2-3 MB. Small enough to not be annoying, but high enough quality that you can still read everything clearly.\n\nThe OCR part is what makes this actually useful day-to-day. Every document becomes searchable. Need that electricity bill from October? Search \"Strom Oktober\" and there it is. Looking for anything from Deutsche Telekom? Just search the name. No more opening twenty PDFs hoping one of them is the right one.\n\nDocuments get organized by date automatically. My folder structure ends up looking like 2025/12/27/contract-whatever.pdf. I don't have to think about where to put things or which category they belong to. The date is enough. If I roughly remember when something arrived, I can find it.\n\nThe document list groups everything by day, which maps nicely to how I actually think about mail. \"That letter came last Friday\" is usually how I remember things, not \"that letter is in the insurance folder.\"\n\nHere's what actually happens now when mail arrives:\n\nLetter comes in. I open it, take maybe 10 seconds to decide if it's worth keeping. Most promotional stuff goes straight to recycling, no scanning needed. But anything that looks even remotely important gets the treatment.\n\nI pull out my phone, open Digitize (it's saved as a home screen shortcut, so it launches like a native app), snap photos of each page. Takes maybe 15 seconds for a typical one-page letter. Multi-page stuff takes a bit longer, but rarely more than a minute.\n\nName it something descriptive like \"telekom-rechnung-dezember\" or \"versicherung-bestaetigung\", pick the folder, save. Done.\n\nThen comes the satisfying part: the shredder. There's something weirdly cathartic about watching a piece of paper turn into confetti immediately after digitizing it. Like closing a browser tab after finishing a task. The physical object is gone, but the information is preserved. Feels like progress.\n\nTotal time from envelope to shredder: maybe 30 to 45 seconds per document. That's short enough that I actually do it immediately instead of letting things pile up.\n\nOne thing I added that turned out to be more useful than expected: SMB file sharing. The same Docker container runs a Samba server, which means all my scanned documents show up directly in the iOS Files app.\n\nThis matters because sometimes I need a document when I'm not at home. Job interview wants proof of address? I can pull it up on my phone without opening a browser, logging in, navigating to the right folder. It's just... there. Like any other file on my device.\n\nSetting up Samba in Docker was a bit of a pain, honestly. Getting the permissions right, making sure it plays nice with iOS's particular SMB implementation, dealing with the fact that iOS sometimes just decides to disconnect for no reason. But once it worked, it worked well.\n\nFair question. There are plenty of document scanning apps out there, many of them quite good. So why build my own?\n\nPrivacy is the main thing. I don't love the idea of my tax documents, contracts, salary statements, and personal letters sitting on some company's servers. Even if they promise end-to-end encryption, even if they're probably fine. I'd rather just not. If I can self-host it, I will.\n\nThere's also the subscription thing. Most of the good scanning apps want a monthly fee for OCR or cloud sync or whatever. I get it, they need to make money. But I already have a server running 24/7. I already pay for storage. Adding another monthly subscription for something I can build myself in a weekend feels unnecessary.\n\nAnd then there's the customization aspect. The German interface, the specific folder structure, the way documents are named, the Samba integration. All of that is exactly how I want it because I built it for myself. No compromises, no \"that feature is coming in the next update,\" no hoping the company doesn't pivot to something else.\n\nFinally, honestly? It was just a fun project. Sometimes you build things not because they're strictly necessary, but because the building itself is enjoyable. A quiet week between Christmas and New Year, some hot chocolate, and a clear goal. Good times.\n\nMy desk is clear. Like, actually clear. Not \"clear except for that one stack I'm pretending isn't there\" but genuinely empty except for my keyboard and monitor. There's one small tray for incoming mail that gets processed within a day or two at most. Everything else is digital, backed up, searchable.\n\nI've already had one moment where this paid off. Needed to check something on our internet contract, how long the minimum term was. Opened Files on my phone, searched \"telekom vertrag,\" found it in seconds. Previously that would have been a 15-minute expedition into the filing cabinet, assuming I even filed it correctly.\n\nThe real test will be tax season though. Every year I spend an entire weekend hunting down receipts, bank statements, and whatever else the Finanzamt wants. If I can pull together everything I need in under an hour this time, this project will have paid for itself in saved frustration alone.\n\nAsk me again in April how that went.\n\nFor now, I'm just enjoying the empty desk. And the fact that when my insurance sends that replacement document, I'll know exactly what to do with it.",

    "title": "UVB-76 (The Buzzer)",
    "description": null,
    "fullText": "UVB-76 (Russian: УВБ-76; see § Name and callsigns for other callsigns), also known by the nickname \"The Buzzer\", is a shortwave radio station that broadcasts in upper sideband mode on the frequency of 4625 kHz (wavelength of 64.8 m).[1][2] It broadcasts a short, monotonous ⓘ, repeating at a rate of approximately 25 tones per minute, 24 hours per day.[1] Sometimes, the buzzer signal is interrupted and a voice transmission in Russian takes place.[3][4][5][6] Although the true nature of the transmission has never been revealed, it is speculated to be related to the Dead Hand system, thus the transmission being sometimes referred to as the Doomsday Radio.[7]\n\nThe station is commonly known as \"The Buzzer\"[8] in both English and Russian (Russian: Жужжалка, romanized: Zhuzhzhalka). From its first voice transmission in 1997 to 2010, the station identified itself as UZB-76[9][10] (Russian: УЗБ-76). The callsign UVB-76 was never used by the station itself, but is rather a mistranscription of UZB-76.[2] However, the station is still often referred to by that name. In the following years of transmission, the main callsign of the station changed regularly.\n\nIn addition to these main callsigns, The Buzzer also uses other \"side callsigns\" which are being used less frequently than the main callsign. Whenever the main callsign changes, all previous side callsigns are also discarded.[1]\n\nThe station transmits using AM with a suppressed lower sideband (USB modulation), but it has also used full double-sideband AM (A3E). The signal consists of a buzzing sound that lasts 1.2 seconds, pausing for 1–1.3 seconds, and repeating 21–34 times per minute. Until November 2010, the buzz tones lasted approximately 0.8 seconds each.[1][11] One minute before the hour, the repeating tone was previously replaced by a continuous, uninterrupted alternating tone, which continued for one minute until the short repeating buzz resumed, although this stopped occurring in June 2010.[12]\n\nSince the start of broadcasting, The Buzzer broadcasts as a repeating two-second pip.[13][14]\n\nThe buzzing sound is sometimes interrupted by the broadcast of voice messages. These messages are always given in Russian by a live voice, and follow three fixed formats:[2][1][15][16]\n\nA message in the Monolith format always consists of the following parts:\n\nExample of a Monolith message sent on The Buzzer with exactly one callsign, one ID group and one message block (most common type):\n\nMonolith messages can however contain any number of items from each part:\n\nA message in the Uzor format always consists of the following parts:\n\nNowadays, Uzor messages are rarely sent on The Buzzer.\n\nKomanda is the most uncommon type of voice message. Since it has not been heard for years, messages of this type are most likely not being sent on The Buzzer anymore. They consist of a callsign (read out twice), a codephrase (Russian: ОБЪЯВЛЕНА КОМАНДА, romanized: OB'YaVLYeNA KOMANDA, lit. 'command announced'), and a following number.\n\nDistant conversations and other background noises have frequently been heard behind the buzzer; this suggests that the buzzing tones are not generated internally, but are produced by a device placed near a live and constantly open microphone. Because of the occasional fluctuating pitch of the buzzing tones, it is supposed that the tones are generated by a tonewheel as used in a Hammond organ. It is also possible that a microphone may have been turned on accidentally.[22] One such occasion was on 3 November 2001, when a conversation in Russian was heard:[11]\n\nIn September 2010, several unusual broadcasts were observed; these included portions of the buzzer being replaced with excerpts from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake.[24]\n\nOn 15 May 2020, broadcasts from unknown French speaking persons were heard.[26]\n\nIn January 2022, various signals with spectrogram-encoded images, visible through a spectrum analyzer, were broadcast on the same frequency.[27] There have also been reports of various songs airing on the station's frequency, many of which were connected to internet memes such as the 2012 K-pop song \"Gangnam Style\"; a Vice article attributed these broadcasts to pirates hijacking and spamming the frequency.[28][29] The nationality of the pirates has also come into question by Vice in relation to the 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis and Russo-Ukrainian war.[28]\n\nOnly on very rare occasions have there been any external civilian communications—unless authorised by the Russian defence ministry—with UVB-76, given its status as a military radio. The most recent event occurred under irregular circumstances. During the night of 4 May 2024 at 21:38 (MSK),[30] an unknown Russian-speaking pirate infiltrated the frequency and attempted to contact the station whilst the buzzer was not active, if not on standby. The pirate subsequently asked a series of improvised questions to the station, briefly conversing with the station's operator:\n\nUnknown pirate: А можно шутку рассказать? . . . Один «ррр» (звонок) – «да», два – «нет». (English: Can I tell a joke? One \"rrr\" [buzz] for \"yes\", two for \"no\".)\n\nUVB-76 operator: [Two clear buzzes.]\n\nUnknown pirate: Да за что?? . . . А музыку включить можно? (English: Well, what for? But can I turn on some music?)\n\nUVB-76 operator: [Two clear buzzes.]\n\nUnknown pirate: Почему!? . . . А за такие вопросы вам ничего не будет? (English: But why!? Are you going to get in trouble if you answer my questions?)\n\nUnknown pirate: Да блин! (English: Well, damn!)\n\nOther instances of deliberate hijackings are widely unreported. Another incident occurred one day prior to the above event. An unknown pirate—possibly the same one—attempted to subject the buzzer to interference, prompting the on-duty operator to immediately retaliate, taking preventative measures against the signal incursion. The UVB-76 operator combined three individual transmitters, with one above, one below and the other centre 4625 kHz transmitting MS-5 burst, along with CIS-12 modern audio as well as tones in several states, summarising together a highly dense spectral pattern with the upper-side band. Numerous noticeable transitions were witnessed over the 4625 kHz selected spectrogram section, as the operators frantically fought against the pirates. The incident occurred for around half an hour, until the operators ceased their tactics after the pirate abandoned attempts, as the buzzer was then reactivated.[31]\n\nThe purpose of the station has not been confirmed by government or broadcast officials. However, Rimantas Pleikys, a former Minister of Communications and Informatics of the Republic of Lithuania, has written that the purpose of the voice messages is to confirm that operators at receiving stations are alert.[12][32][33] Another explanation is that the broadcast is constantly being listened to by military commissariats.[34]\n\nThere is speculation published in the Russian Journal of Earth Sciences which describes an observatory measuring changes in the ionosphere by broadcasting a signal at 4,625 kHz, the same broadcast frequency as the Buzzer.[35]\n\nOne possible interpretation is that the voice messages constitute military communications. The possibility of the station being a numbers station for intelligence agencies, such as the FSB or the former KGB of the Soviet Union, is considered unlikely by some, since messages occur at seemingly unpredictable times. In addition, the static frequency of 4,625 kHz and the low transmitter power are likely unsuitable for reliable long-range communication. [original research?]\n\nThe buzzing functions as a \"channel marker\" used to keep the frequency occupied, thereby making it unattractive for other potential users.[1] The signature sound could be used for tuning to the signal on an old analogue receiver. The modulation is suitable to be detected by an electromechanical frequency detector, similar to a tuning fork. This can be used to activate the squelch on a receiver. Due to the varying emission properties on shortwave bands, using a level-based squelch is unreliable. This also allows a signal loss to be detected, causing an alarm to sound on the receiver.\n\nAnother theory, described in a BBC article, states that the tower is connected to the Russian 'Perimeter' missile system, and emits a \"dead hand\" signal that will trigger a nuclear retaliatory response if the signal is interrupted as a result of a nuclear attack against Russia.[8] This theory is also unlikely, given that the signal frequently breaks down or is routinely switched off for maintenance.[23]\n\nThere are two other Russian stations that follow a similar format, nicknamed \"The Pip\" and \"The Squeaky Wheel\". Like the Buzzer, these stations transmit a signature sound that is repeated constantly, but is occasionally interrupted to relay coded voice messages.[1]\n\nThe former transmitter was located near Povarovo, Russia,[1][36] at 56°5′0″N 37°6′37″E﻿ / ﻿56.08333°N 37.11028°E﻿ / 56.08333; 37.11028 which is about halfway between Zelenograd and Solnechnogorsk and 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) northwest of Moscow, near the village of Lozhki. The location and callsign were unknown until the first known voice broadcast of 1997.[37] In September 2010, the station's transmitter was moved to the nearby city of Saint Petersburg, near the village of Kerro Massiv (60°18′40.73″N 30°16′45.06″E﻿ / ﻿60.3113139°N 30.2791833°E﻿ / 60.3113139; 30.2791833).\nThis may have been due to a reorganization of the Russian military. Prior to 9 August 2015, the station is not transmitting from the Kerro Massiv transmitter site (\"Irtysh\") anymore, possibly due to a reorganization of the Russian military for the particular area which may cause the frequency to be used only in the Moscow Military District. At present, The Buzzer appears to be broadcast only from the 69th Communication Hub in Naro Fominsk, Moscow.[3] In 2011, a group of urban explorers claimed to have explored the buildings at Povarovo to find an abandoned military base and, in it, a radio log record confirming the operation of a transmitter at 4,625 kHz.[better source needed][38][39]\n\nBesides the main callsign, there have been transmissions containing different callsigns such as[citation needed]:\n\nRussian state media RIA Novosti reported on November 14 2025 that the UVB-76 broadcast was temporarily cut off due to a drone strike against a nearby power station.[40]",

    "fullText": "The United States has already been hit with quite a few winter storms over the past several weeks, bringing heavy snow and high winds to parts of the country. Now, another major winter storm is approaching parts of the United States, and the National Weather Service (NWS) has warned about the dangers it could bring.\n\nOn Sunday, the NWS issued a winter storm warning for parts of the country and even a blizzard warning for parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin as Winter Storm Ezra approached, bringing as much as 25 inches of snow and 75 mile per hour winds to some parts of the country.\n\nAs a result of what has been described as a \"dangerous\" and \"potentially life-threatening\" storm, the NWS is urging people in the area to simply stay inside and do not travel.\n\nOn Sunday, the NWS warned of a powerful winter storm that was expected to impact at least 15 states around the country, bringing \"heavy snow, blizzard conditions, hazardous ice, and bitterly cold wind chills\" to some parts of the country.\n\n\"A rapidly-intensifying storm will move from the Great Lakes into southern Canada today through Monday. Heavy snow, blizzard conditions, and icing are expected from the Upper Midwest through the Great Lakes and Northeast,\" the NWS warned in an advisory early Sunday morning.\n\nThe NWS warned of \"blizzard conditions\" that would result in \"dangerous travel conditions.\"\n\nA rapidly intensifying low pressure system will bring a plethora of impactful winter weather hazards through early next week over the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, & Northeast. Heavy snow, blizzard conditions, treacherous icing, high winds, & bitterly cold wind chills are expected. pic.twitter.com/TRZ3YLu3uJ\n\n— NWS Weather Prediction Center (@NWSWPC) December 28, 2025\n\n\"Over a foot of lake-enhanced snow along Michigan's Sioux Falls Upper Peninsula is forecast. Blizzard conditions are likely, resulting in dangerous travel conditions and scattered power outages across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes Omaha into Monday. Heavy lake-effect snow is expected on westerly flow from Lakes Erie and Ontario Monday afternoon into Tuesday,\" the NWS warned.\n\nWhile the NWS map shows areas of the country receiving 18 inches of snow, some meteorologists are predicting up to 36 inches of snow in some areas.\n\nIn addition to the massive snow accumulation, the NWS warned of strong winds and dangerously cold temperatures, as well.\n\n\"Wind gusts in excess of 40 mph and bitterly cold temperatures spilling south from Canada will lead sub-zero wind chills into Monday. Dangerously cold wind chills as cold as -30°F are likely in North Dakota and northern Minnesota,\" the NWS warned.\n\nAs a result of these extreme conditions that have persisted throughout the season, the NWS has continually urged anyone in the area to stay indoors as much as possible, especially amid the sub-zero wind chills and strong winds.\n\n“Cold outside? Avoid the risk of frostbite and hypothermia by dressing in layers, covering exposed skin, and limiting time outdoors,” the NWS wrote in a post on X earlier this month. “If someone might be experiencing either condition, seek medical attention immediately — and know your actions.”\n\nThis type of severe winter weather is especially dangerous for newborns, the elderly, those with chronic illnesses, outdoor workers, and unhoused individuals, the NWS warned.\n\n“Everyone is at risk from the dangers of extreme cold, but these groups are more vulnerable than most. Age and certain conditions make the body less able to regulate temperature,” the NWS warns.\n\nThe NWS advised people to limit time outside, but to wear loose layers and cover all skin if they do have to venture outdoors. Additionally, the NWS advises people to consume hot foods and warm drinks, but avoid caffeine and alcohol.\n\nIn addition to urging everyone to stay indoors and out of the elements as much as possible, the NWS has also warned against even attempting to try to travel in these extreme conditions.\n\nThe NWS has issued a blizzard warning for parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin, warning of \"dangerous\" and \"potentially life-threatening\" travel conditions. In those areas, the NWS warned to avoid travel altogether.\n\nOther areas are in a winter storm warning rather than a more severe blizzard warning. In those areas, the NWS still urges people to reconsider and limit their travels and to expect \"considerable travel problems.\"\n\nIf travel is absolutely necessary, the NWS urges travelers to be prepared with some emergency items like a cell phone charger, a flashlight, a first aid kit, jumper cables, road flares, tire chains or snow tires, water and snacks, a full tank of gas, a bag of sand or cat litter, a shovel, an ice scraper, a tow rope, water and snacks, and warm clothing and blankets.\n\n\"You never know when you will encounter winter weather or an emergency road closure,\" the NWS warns.",

    "fullText": "DENVER (KDVR) — Hundreds of flights were delayed at Denver International Airport on Sunday as snow across the country and heavy holiday travel combined to slow operations on one of the busiest travel days of the season.\n\nAirport officials said passenger volume was high as travelers returned home from holiday celebrations, while others arrived in Denver ahead of New Year’s festivities. Long lines formed throughout the airport, from parking shuttles to baggage check and security checkpoints.\n\nSee the latest traffic conditions in Denver on FOX31\n\nSecurity wait times reached about 30 minutes at their peak on Sunday morning. While most travelers moved through the lines without major issues, at least one passenger said the delays caused her to miss a flight.\n\n“I couldn’t get through security, and I had a really nice guy help me get a flight change,” said Kelly Marlor, who was traveling Sunday.\n\nFlightAware reported that more than 480 flights at Denver International Airport were delayed or canceled by 2 p.m. Some travelers also experienced turbulent flights due to windy conditions.\n\n“It was really bad turbulence,” said Sonia Rosenberg, who was visiting friends in Denver. “They couldn’t even give us drinks or snacks on our flight, but it was fine. We made it here. So that’s all that matters.”\n\nDespite the crowds, many travelers said they expected delays and came prepared with extra time. Travelers who spoke to FOX31 said the busy airport was a small price to pay after spending the holidays with loved ones.\n\n“It was a lot of fun,” said Patricia Cunningham, who was traveling home to Albuquerque after visiting her kids for Christmas. “The weather was unusually warm, but we woke up to a little bit of snow today, so that was kind of nice.”\n\nOutside the terminals, reunions played out as friends and family greeted arriving passengers. Risa Nutt and Samantha Freedberg said they were picking up friends they met at summer camp and planned to spend New Year’s together in Denver.\n\n“We’re spending New Year together, so we’re going to take them to all the iconic places,” Nutt said.\n\nAirport officials estimate more than 750,000 passengers traveled through Denver International Airport from Dec. 19 through Sunday.",

    "description": "New information is still emerging.",
    "fullText": "New research suggests captive dolphins may be exposed to more microplastics than wild counterparts — a startling discovery that underscores just how deeply plastic pollution has infiltrated even controlled environments.\n\nA study, published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, aimed to identify microplastics — tiny particles resulting from plastic degradation —  in captive and wild dolphin tissues, including the skin, lung, liver, and gut.\n\nThe researchers said this was an important distinction, as many previous studies only focused on microplastics in gut contents. The scientists hoped to determine whether microplastic contamination extends into tissue.\n\nMicroplastics were found in 80% to 100% of all tissue samples of both wild and captive dolphins, confirming microplastics permeate the entire body rather than remaining confined to the digestive tract.\n\nPerhaps most surprisingly, captive dolphins carried far higher microplastic loads than wild dolphins.\n\nCaptive animals averaged 0.67 microplastics per gram of tissue compared with 0.19 microplastics per gram in wild dolphins.\n\nWild dolphins showed a wider variety of microplastic shapes and colors, which the scientists attributed to diverse environmental sources. Captive dolphins exhibited more uniform types, likely linked to indoor or aquarium-related materials such as textile fibers, facility equipment, or contaminated food and water.\n\nPolyamide and PET were the most common plastic types detected overall. Polyamide, more commonly known as nylon, is often found in textiles, rope, and industrial and auto equipment.\n\nPET, or polyethylene terephthalate, is often found in plastic bottles, food packaging, and polyester clothing.\n\nResearch on microplastics is still emerging, and scientists are only beginning to understand the full impact of these tiny particles. What is clear, however, is that they are incredibly pervasive and can cause lasting harm.\n\nHow do you feel about microplastics being inside our bodies?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"Microplastics … are increasingly recognized as a threat to marine ecosystems,\" the study observed.\n\nThe research highlights just how deeply plastic pollution can infiltrate living organisms — and how even captive species aren't protected from exposure. The higher microplastic loads found in captive dolphins show that plastic contamination extends well beyond our polluted oceans.\n\nPlastics are woven into everyday life — found in textiles, buildings, food packaging, and more. As they degrade, microscopic plastic particles filter out into the environment, infiltrating food, water, and even the air we breathe.\n\nWith such a high presence of microplastics in both wild and captive dolphin tissue, the study raises serious questions about what microplastic loads other marine species — and even humans — may be carrying.\n\nWith microplastic pollution tied to health impacts like cancers, lung problems, hormone disruptions, and more, the stakes are high for all living beings.\n\nMicroplastic research is still developing — and has room for improvement. The experts called for more attention to animal tissues in microplastic research, highlighting that analyzing only gut contents significantly underestimates microplastic toxicity.\n\nThey advocated for multi-tissue monitoring to better understand exposure levels and assess potential health risks for both wildlife and humans.\n\nTo help address plastic pollution's impact on marine life, efforts have historically focused on cleaning up the plastic waste already in our oceans. Attention from governments, conservation groups, and industries has broadened to reduce the amount of plastic produced.\n\nDeveloping alternatives to plastic and restricting the use of certain plastics — like microbeads in cosmetics or single-use plastic bags — are key steps toward reducing pollution. Improving recycling and waste-management systems is also needed, which can prevent plastic from entering waterways in the first place.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

Students have said that Sunday’s action was meant to put further pressure on Vucic and as a test of support.\n\nYoung protesters have been at the forefront of a nationwide movement against Vucic's populist rule in Serbia. More than a year of street protests first started in November 2024 after a train station disaster that killed 16 people.\n\nThe concrete canopy collapse in the northern city of Novi Sad was widely blamed on alleged rampant corruption and disregard of construction and safety rules during renovation work at the station. No one has been held responsible for the tragedy.\n\nVucic has refused to schedule an immediate early vote, but has suggested that it could be held sometime next year. Both parliamentary and presidential elections are otherwise due in 2027.\n\n“We have stands that serve to connect with the citizens,\" said Igor Dojnov, a student manning one of the points in central Belgrade.\n\nYouth-led protests during the past year have shaken Vucic more than ever during his 13-year-long tenure. Serbia's populist prime minister resigned in January, and Vucic later launched a crackdown on protesters that also drew international criticism.\n\nWhile street protests have subsided, discontent with Vucic's government is believed to be widespread.\n\nMilca Cankovic Kadijevic, a resident of Belgrade, said that she supported the students, because “I have a desire to live decently — me, my children and my grandchildren.\"\n\nVucic has formally promised to take Serbia into the European Union, but he has maintained close links with Russia and China, while facing accusations of clamping down on democratic freedoms and allowing corruption and organized crime to flourish.\n\nHe has denied this, and accused the protesters of attempting to orchestrate a “color revolution” under unspecified orders from the West. The term “color revolution” has been used to describe a series of mass protests at the beginning of the 21st century that sometimes led to the toppling of governments in the former Soviet Union states, the former Yugoslavia, the Middle East and Asia.",

It was FAST & DECISIVE, as all of these situations should be!” Trump wrote.\n\nThe talks in China aim to ensure a sustained ceasefire and promote lasting peace between the countries, according to a statement by Sihasak’s office.\n\nWang was scheduled to join both bilateral meetings with each of the diplomats and a trilateral talk on Monday.\n\nChina has welcomed the ceasefire announcement, which freezes the front lines and allows for displaced civilians to return to their homes near the border.\n\n“China stands ready to continue to provide (the) platform and create conditions for Cambodia and Thailand to have fuller and more detailed communication,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement read.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement comes with a 72-hour observation period, at the end of which Thailand agreed to repatriate 18 Cambodian soldiers it has held as prisoners since earlier fighting in July. Their release has been a major demand of the Cambodian side.\n\nPrak Sokhonn, in a statement after his meeting with Wang, expressed deep appreciation for China’s “vital role” in supporting the ceasefire.\n\nChina also announced 20 million yuan ($2.8 million) of emergency humanitarian aid for Cambodia to assist the displaced.\n\nThe first batch of Chinese aid, including food, tents and blankets, arrived in Cambodia on Sunday, Wang Wenbin, Chinese ambassador to Cambodia, wrote on Facebook.\n\nSihasak said Sunday he hoped the meetings would convey to China that it should both support a sustainable ceasefire and send a signal to Cambodia against reviving the conflict or attempting to create further ones.\n\n“Thailand does not see China merely as a mediator in our conflict with Cambodia but wants China to play a constructive role in ensuring a sustainable ceasefire by sending such signals to Cambodia as well,” he said.",

    "fullText": "A Trump administration official credited the president with making small business owners “excited” to pay their taxes thanks to tax cuts and less regulation.\n\nKelly Loeffler, administrator of the Small Business Administration, told Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures that “small business optimism is above its 52-year average.”\n\nLoeffler said a lot of the optimism is due to the Working Families Tax Cut in Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill.”\n\n“Small businesses finally have certainty about what their tax rate’s going to be,” Loeffler said. “That 20% pass-through deduction, now the 179 expensing that means higher limits on the ability to expense immediately for purchases they make in capital equipment, and also R&D expensing.”\n\nThose factors, according to Loeffler, actually have small business owners jazzed about writing a check to Uncle Sam.\n\n“I don’t think small business owners have ever been so excited to pay their taxes thanks to President Trump!” Loeffler said. “He brought us the blue collar boom in his first term, and now he’s going to add to that the small business boom.”\n\nHost Cheryl Casone, in for Maria Bartiromo, asked Loeffler about “those onerous federal regulations under the Biden administration,” and whether removing them “could be another way to boost the health of small business.”\n\n“Absolutely. Regulation is a tax on a small business, and under President Trump in his first year, about $200 billion in regulations have been cut,” Loeffler said.\n\nThe SBA’s goal for 2026 is “to make sure that small businesses are able to have relief after four very active years of regulating under Joe Biden that heaped trillions of dollars on the backs of small businesses,” Loeffler said. “So, we’re leading a strike force at the SBA to roll back even more regulations.”\n\nLoeffler has been criticized for aggressively cutting staff at the SBA, and for rolling back Biden administration changes “aimed at easing access to credit for the smallest enterprises,” The New York Times reported.\n\n“The changes are especially problematic for Black, Hispanic and immigrant entrepreneurs,” the report continued. “In the name of eradicating diversity, equity and inclusion practices, the Small Business Administration is shedding programs aimed at helping disadvantaged businesses, including those run by women.”\n\nWatch above via Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News.\n\nThe post Trump Official Brags On Fox News: ‘I Don’t Think Small Business Owners Have Ever Been So Excited to Pay Their Taxes!’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "As the S&P 500 hovers near record highs, strategists shrug off concerns of an AI bubble, for now.",
    "fullText": "As stocks sit near all-time highs, strategists are brushing off concerns of an AI bubble.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) is on pace to close out the year with a gain of over 17%, powered by a 26% jump in technology stocks (XLK).\n\n“I don't see a bubble at all. However, I do believe we're going to be going into a bubble,” Sanctuary Wealth chief investment strategist Mary Ann Bartels told Yahoo Finance last week.\n\nBatels compared the current market to prior bubbles, including the late 1920s and the dot-com bubble.\n\n“We're tracking pretty similarly. In fact, it's kind of eerie how we're actually tracking that pattern,” she said. “I see a bubble occurring but not out until maybe ’29 into ’30.”\n\nBut for the time being, Sanctuary strategists forecast that tech will continue leading the market higher out into the end of the decade. They place the S&P 500 anywhere between 10,000 and 13,000 by 2030.\n\n“That's why we're calling 2026, you know, to be fearless, that there's still significant upside in this market, particularly for technology,” she said.\n\nPart of the upside comes from semiconductor stocks. Once treated as commodity plays, they become growth stocks, with Nvidia (NVDA) “basically rewriting the path for semiconductor chips.”\n\nThe AI chip powerhouse has surged over 40% so far this year, pushing its market cap to $4.6 trillion and making it the most valuable publicly traded company. On Friday, Nvidia shares rose after the company announced a $20 billion licensing deal with specialized chipmaker Groq (GROQ.PVT).\n\nThe deal was announced as the chip space has heated up, with Alphabet's Google (GOOG) making headlines with its specialized customer chips called TPUs.\n\nAlphabet stock has soared some 65% year to date.\n\nUBS strategists also expect the AI boom and robust profit growth to underpin market gains in 2026.\n\n“We note that forward price-to-earnings multiples are only marginally higher than at the start of the year, reinforcing the fact that earnings growth and not valuation bubbles have driven market gains,” wrote the strategists last week.\n\nUBS forecasts S&P 500 earnings per share to grow about 10% year over year, pushing the index to 7,700 by the end of next year.\n\nVeteran strategist Ed Yardeni also sees the index reaching 7,700 next year, with the probability of his \"Roaring 2020s\" scenario at 60%. He cited, among other reasons, tax benefits from the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" that passed this year and the AI boom.\n\nIn October, Goldman Sachs analysts argued the stock market isn’t in a bubble because tech stocks have risen mostly due to actual growth, not speculative bets. The firm noted that top-performing companies have strong balance sheets and the AI sector is still mostly led by a few big players, while most bubbles occur when many new entrants rush into a hot sector.",

    "fullText": "The craft beer apocalypse, which industry experts assert began in 2023, is completing its third year and continues to leave victims in its trail.\n\nThe apocalypse reportedly began in 2023 after the Brewers Association posted historic amounts of craft brewery closures of over 385 for the year, Paste reported. Since then, many more craft breweries have shut their doors.\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming that the apocalypse continued in 2025, as over 250 breweries in the U.S. closed down permanently in the first six months of the year, and many more have followed those closings in the second half of the year.\n\nAmong the reasons given for breweries closing have been rising costs of ingredients, labor, and products, slowing taproom traffic, and fierce retail competition, according to American Craft Beer.\n\nOne of the most recent closings was Miamisburg, Ohio, craft brewery Entropy Brewing Company, which revealed on social media that it would close down its business permanently on Dec. 27, 2025, with no plans yet to file for bankruptcy.\n\nOthers that filed for Chapter 7 liquidation and planned to close down included St. Petersburg, Fla.-based brewery Dissent Craft Brewing, which filed bankruptcy in August; Exton, Pa.-based Iron Hill Brewery LLC and San Jose, Calif.-based Strike Brewing Company, which both filed in October; and Oregon-based Rogue Ales & Spirits, which filed in November.\n\nAnd now, New Mexico-based Bosque Brewing Company is closing down all of its taproom locations and ending its business after a federal judge dismissed the brewer's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case on Dec. 22 because it had too much debt to reorganize, KOB-TV 4 in Albuquerque reported.\n\nThe dismissal of the Chapter 11 case will likely prompt the brewery company to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation unless it can settle all of its debts with its creditors out of court.\n\nBosque Brewing said that it will shut down all of its remaining public houses on Dec. 28 at 5 p.m. Mountain Standard Time, in a message it posted on its website on Dec. 26.\n\n\"With heavy hearts, we are closing all Bosque branded Public Houses. Nob Hill will close today (Dec. 26) at 5 pm and the rest of the taprooms will close on Sunday, December 28th at 5pm,\" the message said.\n\nThe brewery had 11 locations in New Mexico before closing The Drinkery at 4980 Promenade Blvd. and its Restoration Pizza at 1607 Alcaldesa Street, both in Santa Fe, on Dec. 3.",

    "fullText": "A 23-year-old independent YouTube journalist’s video exposing examples of what he calls “potentially the largest fraud scandal in U.S. history” in Minnesota has racked up more than 90 million views in just two days on X and YouTube, accelerating a cascading narrative around abuse of social services centered mostly on the state’s Somali population.\n\nIn the 42-minute video, Nick Shirley, wearing a grey hoodie and working with a fellow independent investigator he identifies only as “David,” visits a series of social-service oriented businesses in and around the Twin Cities to confront “the people who are making millions of dollars” from social services including meal programs, housing assistance and health services – though the biggest piece seems to be childcare centers, where Shirley shows up during weekday business hours to find no children present.\n\nDavid says his personal inquiry, which has included his own research and sources at the statehouse in St. Paul, has uncovered more than 1,000 fraudulent service-oriented businesses, more than 800 of which are Somali-owned. He says he began investigating when he noticed childless day-care centers and drivers for a “non-emergency medical transportation” service based near his office that never carried any passengers.\n\nIn the video, Shirley says the schemes’ now-estimated $9 billion in purported pilfered public funds is “so much fraud it could almost replace the entire GDP of Somalia,” which is estimated at $12 billion.\n\n“Here is the full 42 minutes of my crew and I exposing Minnesota fraud, this might be my most important work yet,” Shirley wrote in the viral X post. “We uncovered over $110,000,000 in ONE day. Like it and share it around like wildfire! Its time to hold these corrupt politicians and fraudsters accountable. We ALL work way too hard and pay too much in taxes for this to be happening, the fraud must be stopped.”\n\nHere is the full 42 minutes of my crew and I exposing Minnesota fraud, this might be my most important work yet. We uncovered over $110,000,000 in ONE day. Like it and share it around like wildfire! Its time to hold these corrupt politicians and fraudsters accountable\n\nWe ALL… pic.twitter.com/E3Penx2o7a\n\n— Nick shirley (@nickshirleyy) December 26, 2025\n\nMinnesota’s unfolding fraud scandal has implicated dozens of businesses and individuals who are accused of enriching themselves via submitting fraudulent claims funded by both state and federal taxpayer dollars. Charges for at least five new alleged fraudsters were announced earlier this month by Joe Thompson, first assistant U.S. District Attorney for the state of Minnesota, including allegedly fraudulent Medicaid claims involving a “housing stabilization services program.”\n\nThompson characterized the schemes, each of which have allegedly collected millions, as a “fraud tourism” scheme that is under investigation by state and federal agencies including the FBI, Homeland Security and the Justice Department. He said more charges will be announced in the future.\n\nProsecutors have publicly stated that Minnesota may have lost up to $9 billion in misappropriated aid — a figure that has drawn national scrutiny as the investigation continues.\n\nShirley started posting regularly to his YouTube channel in 2019, and has built a large online following by posting videos that combine on-the-ground interviews, commentary, and investigative style reporting, especially on political and social topics. His content often involves interviewing people in public spaces, exploring controversial issues and presenting bold narratives about social unrest, immigration, protests, and alleged fraud.\n\nHis significant following leans toward conservative digital circles – his posts are amplified by political figures like Elon Musk and JD Vance – and has attracted criticism over his methods and perceived bias.\n\nShirley posted a YouTube video of himself meeting with Donald Trump at the White House in October, wherein he tells the president that he’s found evidence that antifa-style protests are stocked with the same people who are “bussed” to various cities to stage the demonstrations.\n\nThe post Young Journalist’s Video Exposing Alleged Billion-Dollar Fraud Scheme in Minnesota Goes Viral ‘Like Wildfire’ appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "Police Scotland said that domestic abuse wouldn’t be tolerated in its pursuit to hold perpetrators accountable",
    "fullText": "Serial domestic abusers in Scotland were sentenced to a total of almost 230 years in prison this year in a major crackdown by the police.\n\nThe force reported that 32 offenders accumulated total sentences of more than 228 years in 2025, with one person given 17 years in jail.\n\nThey were convicted of 240 offences following proactive investigations by Police Scotland’s domestic abuse task force.\n\nThe crimes involved 110 victims, all women and children, with offences including rape, sexual assault, stalking, permanent disfigurement, danger to life, threats against pets and more under the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act.\n\nDomestic abuse crimes have increased by 10 per cent in Scotland over the last year, while detection rates have only increased by nearly 8 per cent.\n\nPolice Scotland officers respond to a domestic abuse call every eight minutes, per the latest figures. More than 66,000 incidents were reported between October 2024 and September this year, of which 40.3 per cent resulted in a crime being recorded.\n\nAssistant chief constable Steve Johnson, executive lead for major crime, public protection, and local crime, said that the force remained “relentless” in tackling domestic abuse.\n\nHe said: “Our officers are determined to ensure women and girls live free from violence and abuse. We are relentless in our focus on tackling domestic abuse. It will not be tolerated, and perpetrators will be held accountable.\n\n“We tackle violence against women and girls every day of the year, preventing harm and bringing offenders to justice. We don’t do this alone but work with partners to identify and address the societal issues at the root of gender-based violence, so that we can stop abusive behaviour before it begins.\n\n“No one should have to experience abuse. We are committed to supporting all victim-survivors, protecting them, and investigating every report of domestic abuse so they can come forward with confidence. Help is available, and you don’t have to face this alone.\n\n“As we look ahead to 2026, our message to offenders remains the same. If you continue to abuse and exhibit abusive behaviour, you will be caught and anyone who continues to abuse will face the full force of the law.”\n\nBetween 25 November and 10 December, the force took part in an annual initiative focused on eliminating gender-based violence called 16 Days of Activism, in which they arrested 500 perpetrators of domestic abuse and charged more than 380.\n\nThe national domestic abuse helpline offers support for women on 0808 2000 247, or you can visit the Refuge website. There is a dedicated men's advice line on 0808 8010 327. Those in the US can call the domestic violence hotline on 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).

They rallied around us, sharing tips and calming me down when the planning became stressful.\n\nMy sister made a scrapbook for me to open the night before the nuptials. Inside, there were handwritten letters from my bridesmaids, my mom, and my 79-year-old grandmother.\n\nThe letters were sweet, romantic, and optimistic — well, almost all of them were. My grandmother's letter had an ominous tone.\n\n\"I wish you and Scott all the happiness in the world in your married life. I am sure you two are just right for each other. That's not to say it will all be plain sailing,\" she wrote.\n\n\"There may be bumps along the road,\" she added, \"but love has a way of forgiving a multitude of sins.\"\n\nIt was a huge contrast to the other letters in the scrapbook. While my bridesmaids reminisced about the past and shared excitement for my future, my grandma's words stopped me in my tracks.\n\nI remember laughing and shaking my head in disbelief. I then handed the letter to my mom, who was equally unimpressed.\n\nIt's not that I didn't appreciate the advice. But really, who wants to hear the words \"love\" and \"sins\" mentioned in the same sentence? Especially when it's in relation to your own husband.\n\nFor a brief moment, I contemplated what she meant by the word \"sins.\" Cheating? Lying? Or something else?\n\nMy gran has a fantastic relationship with my husband, so I couldn't imagine what sparked her cautionary words. Similarly, I had never spoken a bad word about Scott to my grandmother.\n\nOf course, like any couple, we'd had fights, but it was never anything relationship-threatening. And I had never spoken about it with my her.\n\nUltimately, I disregarded the note, just as you would ignore a speck of dirt on a white wedding dress. Even if nobody else notices it, you know it's there.\n\nThe wedding day was picture-perfect.\n\nI felt so fortunate that we got to celebrate with our loved ones, especially our grandmothers. Both Scott and I were the first grandchildren in our families to get married, so it felt extra special.\n\nFive months later, I found my grandma's letter while looking through the scrapbook. It looked different to me with fresh eyes. Now that some time had passed, I could look at it from a new perspective. I could read without taking it personally.\n\nI thought about my grandmother's life, and I realized that her words were never about my husband and me.\n\nMy gran married my late grandfather when they were just teenagers, and it's fair to say they had many bumps in their own love story. Let's just say, their relationship wasn't like the kind I grew up watching in romantic comedies and Disney films.\n\nHowever, they loved each other deeply. They were loyal, forgiving, and supported each other throughout their more than 50-year marriage.\n\nThinking about their relationship reminded me that falling in love is a feeling, but staying in love is a choice. It's an action. It's not something that just happens to a person.\n\nThe wedding is the beautiful part, but the marriage? That's where things have the potential to get messy.\n\nI've been married for less than a year, so I'm not pretending to know all the answers. But if I'm honest with myself, I can admit that my grandma's letter shook me because it didn't fit the aesthetic Instagram version of what I thought marriage was supposed to be.\n\nI know that my husband and I have a great deal of joy ahead of us. But we're also going to witness one another's pain, grief, disappointment, and growth. That's just a part of sharing your life with someone.\n\nIf I ever catch myself feeling unprepared, I know I can revisit my grandma's letter.",

    "description": "Lou Gerstner, who led IBM's 1990s turnaround, has died, the company told staff.",
    "fullText": "Lou Gerstner, the former CEO of IBM who led the company through one of the most consequential turnarounds in corporate history, died on Saturday at the age of 83, the company said.\n\nGerstner ran IBM from 1993 to 2002, arriving at a time when the company was under severe pressure, and its future was in doubt. IBM was losing money, the tech industry was shifting rapidly, and there was widespread expectation that the company would be broken up.\n\nInstead, Gerstner chose to keep IBM together. He pushed the company to organize around customer needs rather than internal divisions, helping reposition IBM as a provider of integrated technology and services for large enterprises. That decision became central to IBM's recovery and renewed relevance.\n\nGerstner also drove cultural change inside the company. He emphasized direct decision-making, accountability, and execution, while insisting that innovation mattered only if it translated into real value for clients. The approach marked a sharp break from IBM's inward-looking habits that had taken hold before his arrival, IBM said in its announcement of Gerstner's death.\n\nHis tenure included painful restructuring. IBM abandoned long-standing traditions, including its decades-long \"cradle to grave\" no-layoff policy, as it sought to stabilize its finances and compete more aggressively. Many credit those moves, along with Gerstner's strategic focus, with saving the company from collapse.\n\nBefore joining IBM, Gerstner built a high-profile career in corporate America. He was a partner at McKinsey & Company, later served as president of American Express, and was CEO of RJR Nabisco. After leaving IBM, he chaired the Carlyle Group and focused on philanthropy, particularly in education and biomedical research.\n\nA native of Long Island, New York, Gerstner earned a degree from Dartmouth College and an MBA from Harvard. IBM said it plans to hold a celebration of his legacy in the new year.",

    "description": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned on X that the job would be \"stressful\" and they'll need to \"jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.\"",
    "fullText": "OpenAI wants to pay someone over half a million dollars to mitigate the downsides of AI.\n\nIf that seems like a lot of money, consider those potential downsides: job loss, misinformation, abuse by malicious actors, environmental destruction, and the erosion of human agency, to name a few.\n\nCEO Sam Altman described the job as \"stressful\" in an X post on Saturday. \"You'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,\" Altman wrote.\n\nAltman said the \"head of preparedness\" position is \"a critical role at an important time.\"\n\n\"Models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges. The potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025; we are just now seeing models get so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities,\" he wrote.\n\nOpenAI's ChatGPT has helped popularize AI chatbots among consumers, many of whom use the technology to research topics, draft emails, plan trips, or perform other simple tasks.\n\nSome users also talk to the bots as an alternative to therapy, which has exacerbated mental health issues in some cases, encouraging delusions and other concerning behavior.\n\nOpenAI said in October it was working with mental health professionals to improve how ChatGPT interacts with users who exhibit concerning behavior, including psychosis or self-harm.\n\nOpenAI's core mission is to develop artificial intelligence in a way that benefits all of humanity. It made safety protocols a central part of its operations from the outset. As it began releasing products, however, and pressure to turn a profit grew, some former staffers have said the company began to prioritize profit over safety.\n\nJan Leiki, the former leader of the now-dissolved safety team at OpenAI, said in a May 2024 post on X announcing his resignation that the company had lost sight of its mission to ensure the technology is deployed safely.\n\n\"Building smarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor. OpenAI is shouldering an enormous responsibility on behalf of all of humanity,\" he wrote. \"But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.\"\n\nLess than a week later, another staffer announced their resignation on X, also citing safety concerns. One former staffer, Daniel Kokotajlo, said in a May 2024 blog post that he resigned because he was \"losing confidence that it would behave responsibly around the time of AGI.\"\n\nKokotajlo later told Fortune that OpenAI initially had about 30 people researching safety issues related to AGI, a still theoretical version of AI that reasons as well as humans, but a series of departures reduced that head count by almost half.\n\nThe company's former head of preparedness, Aleksander Madry, assumed a new role in July 2024. The position is part of OpenAI's Safety Systems team, which develops safeguards, frameworks, and evaluations for the company's models. The job pays $555,000 a year plus equity.\n\n\"You will be the directly responsible leader for building and coordinating capability evaluations, threat models, and mitigations that form a coherent, rigorous, and operationally scalable safety pipeline,\" the job listing says.",

    "description": "Tiffany Chng and Olivia Yiong were work besties. Both were laid off, so during the pandemic, they ditched corporate and launched an athleisure brand.",
    "fullText": "Tiffany Chng and Olivia Yiong said they went from being work besties to regular besties and then work besties again.\n\nThe duo, both 31, met in 2018 and became inseparable while working at GuavaPass, a fitness app. Yiong was laid off when Guavapass was acquired by ClassPass in 2019.\n\nTwo years later, during the pandemic, Chng was laid off from her marketing job. The duo reunited to launch an athleisure brand, then called Butter, despite having no experience in fashion or entrepreneurship.\n\nChng's retrenchment and the pandemic lockdown gave them the push they needed to start the brand.\n\n\"At that point, we had nothing to lose,\" Yiong said.\n\nThey started with online sales, and in October this year, they opened their first retail store in Singapore's upscale ION Orchard mall, in the heart of the city's luxury shopping district.\n\nBuilding a brand during the pandemic in an already saturated market and for a conservative audience was not easy.\n\nExercise and sports have always been a big part of the founders' lives.\n\nYiong was an F45 trainer, has practiced yoga, pilates, and Muay Thai, and is now training for her first Hyrox. Chng was part of a national team representing Singapore at the 2011 Touch Rugby World Cup and has also dabbled in cheerleading, pilates, yoga, and HIIT.\n\nWhen Chng was laid off from ClassPass in 2020, they decided to go all in on an athleisure clothing line, which started off with the name \"Butter.\" They invested 20,000 Singapore dollars in 2020 into the brand.\n\nHalf came from Yiong's savings, and the other half came from Chng's severance pay.\n\nThey started product design in March 2020 and found suppliers in China. They launched in October that year with just two products in two colors: a longline sports bra and a pair of leggings.\n\nCOVID lockdowns that pushed everyone online helped them gain visibility. About 500 people joined an online workout they hosted in March 2021.\n\nIn 2022, they sold the brand to Love, Bonito, a Singaporean women's wear brand. Afterward, they changed the brand's name to Cheak.\n\nLaunching an athleisure brand in Singapore came with a unique set of challenges.\n\nWomen in Singapore and Southeast Asia place a high value on modesty and require padding in the bust, the duo said.\n\n\"A lot of overseas brands don't have padding. In Singapore, you need padding; it's non-negotiable. One of the most commonly asked questions we get is, 'Does it have padding?'\" Chng said.\n\n\"But padding changes the construction completely for the product — it requires so many more stitches, and it makes it difficult to have a very clean bind,\" she added.\n\nAnother issue was the sheerness of the fabric.\n\n\"Overseas brands don't double line their lighter colors because I think the women are a bit more comfortable with a slight sheerness, but in Singapore, that's not acceptable,\" she said.\n\n\"But when you double-line a garment, it becomes very thick. So, we spent about a year changing the fabric and reducing its thickness so that when we double-lined it, it would still be comfortable,\" Chng added.\n\nDesigning clothes for a customer base that likes to play it safe requires a good deal of restraint, the founders said. They said there was plenty they wanted to experiment with, but had to tone down.\n\n\"A lot of brands that are quite popular internationally are quite sexy and crazy nowadays,\" Yiong said. \"So we take that idea, and tweak it to what will work for our audience.\"\n\nSingapore is becoming a competitive space for athleisure brands. Alo Yoga, the athleisure brand worn by Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber, opened its first store in the city's Marina Bay Sands mall in September.\n\nIn ION Orchard, the mall where Cheak is located, shoppers can also find Lululemon, Cotton On Body, and Adidas.\n\nTo stand out, Cheak focuses on making clothes for Asian women — and that doesn't just mean making them more petite.\n\n\"The bust shape is different, our waists are smaller, our hips are slightly wider, and the femur is also a little bit shorter,\" Yiong said.\n\nSizing is different for Asian women, too, she added.\n\n\"We don't necessarily grow taller as we get bigger; we grow width-wise,\" Yiong said.\n\nShe also said that international brands do not suitably cater to the hot and humid climate that Southeast Asia is known for.\n\n\"Fresh international brands, let's say Alo, for example, they come in bringing winter season clothes,\" she said. \"There's no winter; we only have one season, so the fabric needs to be cooling.\"\n\nCheak's prices are slightly lower than those of its foreign competitors. One of Cheak's bestselling sports bras costs 55 Singapore dollars, or about $42, while a similar-looking piece from Lululemon costs S$58.\n\nThe business has yet to come between the founders.\n\n\"Outside of work, we don't talk about work,\" Chng said. \"We see each other on weekends, and our partners hang out together, but we never talk about work.\"\n\nOn the flipside, at work, they don't talk about other things, helping to distinguish their \"work personality and friend personality.\"\n\nYiong handles the backend work, while Chng handles the creative and customer-facing parts of the work.\n\nBut work and life inevitably collide, like when they go on holiday together and fire up their laptops to solve a crisis.\n\n\"Our partners see that as their cue to go do their own thing,\" Yiong joked.\n\nRunning their business comes with many perks. Chng, who just had a baby, said she loves having a flexible schedule and working in a hybrid setting.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it's less stressful than a corporate job.\n\n\"I think a lot of people glamorize what being a founder or starting your own business is,\" she said. \"You have to be able to give up everything, your time, your money, your brain power, your emotions into the business because if you don't do it, no one else is going to.\"\n\nShe added, \"It takes a different kind of resilience to handle it, but at the same time, I wouldn't trade it for anything.\"",

    "title": "I'm a professional chocolatier. When cocoa prices spiked, I found ways to make better chocolate — not smaller bars.",
    "description": "When cocoa prices doubled, chocolatier Jerome Peñafort of Mr. Bucket Chocolaterie refused shrinkflation by finding new ways to innovate.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jerome Peñafort, 38, the founder of Mr. Bucket Chocolaterie in Singapore. The following has been edited for length and clarity\n\nOnce prices go up, they rarely come back down — and that's definitely true for cocoa.\n\nFor a small business where the main material is cocoa, it's a real issue when your core ingredient keeps getting more expensive.\n\nWe work directly with farmers across Southeast Asia, so even before prices started climbing around mid-2023, we were already paying about two to three times the market rate — and now we're paying even more.\n\nWe're still paying the same higher price to our farmers, even though cocoa prices on financial exchanges have softened in recent months, because yields have dropped due to global warming and disease.\n\nThe higher cocoa prices have cut into profit margins. We're not profitable every month or year.\n\nThat has forced us to think differently about how we work: how we innovate, how we become more efficient, and how we stay true to our purpose.\n\nBefore founding Mr. Bucket, I worked in private equity and real estate, where I learned most of my business concepts.\n\nAbout eight years ago, my dad got involved in my uncle's chocolate manufacturing company. I joined the team around 2019 and began learning about chocolate and the entire supply chain.\n\nDuring that time, I had a conversation with a buyer from China that really sparked the idea of Mr. Bucket. We were selling entry-level supermarket chocolate when he told me that even if our chocolate was similar in quality to European brands, it would always be priced lower — simply because it wasn't made in Europe.\n\nThat really made me think: Why is Asian chocolate seen as inferior to European chocolate? Cocoa grows near the equator — in Asia, Africa, Central and South America — but not in Europe. It's just processed there.\n\nIn 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we launched Mr Bucket as an independent company and started making chocolate in Singapore when operations in Malaysia were disrupted. That's when I realized that chocolate made from Asian beans is delicious.\n\nOur first collaboration was with local snack brand The Golden Duck, when we infused their salted-egg flavor into our bonbons — a chocolate shell with layered fillings.\n\nA post shared by Mr. Bucket Chocolaterie (@mrbucketchocolaterie)\n\nDays after we launched the campaign, Singapore announced a lockdown, and because everyone was stuck at home, the response was amazing. We sold out hundreds of boxes of bonbons in two weeks.\n\nIn late 2020, Mr. Bucket launched a retail outlet in a local residential neighborhood, and in 2022, we opened a café at Dempsey Hill, a lifestyle destination in Singapore.\n\nWe can't plan our business around the hope that cocoa prices will come down. If they do, it's a bonus.\n\nHigh cocoa prices have forced us to be more productive and innovative in every part of the business.\n\nThe biggest change was in the product itself.\n\nWe started using the whole cacao fruit — not just the nibs that are usually ground with cocoa butter and sugar to make chocolate. We also use the husk and the pulp, which have a lot of flavor — but which are usually discarded — in our café offerings.\n\nWe drew inspiration from coffee and tea, using cacao to make beverages, broth, and even gelato. That helped us diversify and reduce waste.\n\nBecause of these changes, our overall cost of goods has gone down by about 15% to 20% compared with last year, even though raw cocoa prices are higher.\n\nInstead of using a lot of labor to do things by hand, we started automating certain parts. We bought new machinery and increased batch sizes.\n\nThrough it all, we've never changed our recipes, and we won't. We will not compromise on quality.\n\nWe're not reducing sizes either. In fact, some of our products are bigger now, like chocolates with caramel or kaya — a local coconut jam — centers.\n\nWe did a price increase last year. But as we became more efficient, we were able to bring some prices back down a little.\n\nIn this economy, consumers are definitely more conscious of their spending, but we've still seen growth.\n\nTo achieve that, we've had to work a lot harder: put out more products, do more collaborations, and create new products constantly.\n\nFor Christmas, we've launched a festive collection with new flavors like butterscotch and fruitcake.\n\nOur first-year revenue was less than $1 million Singapore dollars. We expect over SG$5 million, or $3.9 million, this year.\n\nWe're not just making chocolate.\n\nWe want to change the perception of Asian chocolate to show that it can be as good as any in the world.\n\nThat's what keeps us going: not cutting corners, but finding new ways to make better chocolate and to build a future for Asian cocoa.\n\nDo you run a small business in Asia affected by rising prices?

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nSenne Lammens (Manchester United): I was going to put David Raya in but I thought one good save doesn't get you in the Team of the Week - the bar is higher than that. He made four or five good saves against Newcastle, conducted his box well and has given Manchester United a platform and base to build off - which they've never had. All that for £18m, not bad at all.\n\nDeclan Rice (Arsenal): I obviously worked the game between Arsenal and Brighton at the weekend and Declan Rice filled in at right-back. He was still massively influential, marauding forward and defensively he was solid. He never had anyone at Brighton get at him. He just handled every situation well.\n\nArchie Gray (Tottenham): This one is a little bit dodgy, but I'm putting him in the team anyway. I'm aware he played in midfield against Crystal Palace but the reason I'm putting him there is because I felt like he needed to get in the team. Simply put: he got the winner and he's done every single thing that Spurs have asked of him - played left-back, played right-back, played right wing. You name it, he's done it all. I think he goes in for that situation\n\nKevin Danso (Tottenham): He was going to Wolves at one point but Spurs swooped in and signed him. I think he was meant to be a squad player but every time he steps in, he's fantastic. He doesn't do anything wrong. He just delivers on what he's supposed to do.\n\nLisandro Martinez (Manchester United): He's only 5ft7, 5ft8 and he had Nick Woltemade in his back pocket all day. It was really good to see him back playing after his massive injury. Him being back fit is monumental, not only for him but his World Cup aspirations as well.\n\nRyan Gravenberch (Liverpool): His influence is very simple: if he plays well, Liverpool play well. Obviously he got a goal against a Wolves team that they had to break down, nice finish. You don't really get that much credit for scoring against Wolves if I'm being totally honest, but he was very instrumental.\n\nTijjani Reijnders (Manchester City): Probably his best game since the first game of the season against Wolves. Not only the goal but his impact on the game. He's starting to show what he did at AC Milan. I really like him as a player.\n\nFlorian Wirtz (Liverpool): Again, he scored against Wolves - who will probably go down as the worst team in Premier League history - but he's growing into it and starting to fill into the shirt. Maybe the absences of Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak have made players start to play through him - and he's starting to be the player we all believed he could be.\n\nRayan Cherki (Manchester City): For me, he's the best player in world football to watch at the moment. He tries things and he's confident on the ball. Even when he makes mistakes, he doesn't care and tries again. He finished the weekend with a goal and an assist. He's the most exciting footballer to watch at this moment in time, and I say that over Lamine Yamal and everyone else.\n\nKevin Schade (Brentford): If you score a hat-trick, you end up in the Team of the Week. It's as simple as that. I nearly put Keith Andrews as the manager of the week.\n\nOllie Watkins (Aston Villa): We don't normally put players in who start on the bench. However, we've broken our rules. He had such an impact in the second half against Chelsea that he has to go in.\n\nUnai Emery (Aston Villa): Unbelievable result. Eleven wins on the bounce. I thought he not only got it spot-on tactically in the second-half, but his in-game managing and the changes he made - most notably when he brought on Ollie Watkins - showed the level he is currently operating at.\n\nHe outcoached Enzo Maresca, who everyone says is a top coach. I think he just showed the level of where he is truly at as a coach and what he can offer.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "description": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin is the top English scorer in the Premier League this season - can he force his way back into the national squad five years after his last cap?",
    "fullText": "One goal in his first 10 Premier League appearances this season had many questioning whether Dominic Calvert-Lewin's best days were behind him.\n\nBut, only four weeks on, he's the most talked-about striker in England after scoring seven goals in six games.\n\nHis latest goal, in the 1-1 draw against Sunderland, took his tally to eight for the season, making him the leading English scorer in the Premier League this campaign.\n\nThe 28-year-old signed for the Whites on a free transfer in the summer after a nine-year spell with Everton, which ended with a series of injuries hampering his final seasons.\n\nBut the numbers behind his resurgence in Daniel Farke's new counter-attacking 3-5-2 formation are impressive.\n\nHis six-game streak places him in elite company as only the 11th English player to score in six or more consecutive Premier League appearances.\n\nTo put that into perspective, even England captain Harry Kane never managed a run this long - his best stands at two separate five-match streaks.\n\nAnd the only English striker to better Calvert-Lewin in recent memory is Jamie Vardy, who went on an eight-game scoring spree for Leicester City in 2019.\n\nSo could Calvert-Lewin yet force his way into Thomas Tuchel's England squad for the World Cup?",

    "fullText": "Former champion Luke Humphries survived a scare to progress to the fourth round of the PDC World Championship as four previous winners won on Sunday.\n\nHumphries, who beat Luke Littler to win the 2024 title, saw off Germany's Gabriel Clemens 4-2.\n\nThe 30-year-old raced into a 3-0 lead but was pegged back to 3-2 and Clemens missed darts to level before Humphries set up a fourth-round tie against Nathan Aspinall or Kevin Doets.\n\nThree-time winner Michael van Gerwen also progressed with a 4-1 win over German debutant Arno Merk.\n\nHe led 2-0 before being pegged back but found another gear to set up a last-16 tie with two-time winner Gary Anderson.\n\nAnderson won a final-set thriller against Jermaine Wattimena in the afternoon to progress alongside 2018 winner Rob Cross.\n\nCross brushed aside Australian 16th seed Damon Heta in a comfortable 4-0 win and will face defending champion Luke Littler in the next round.\n\nThe Netherlands' 10th seed Gian van Veen also progressed after seeing off Latvia's Madars Razma with a 4-1 victory, while 20th seed Ryan Searle reached the fourth round for the first time since 2021 with a 4-0 demolition of Germany's Martin Schindler.",
