    "fullText": "SANTA CLARA, California  — “I’m gonna fight and die to protect them with everything I’ve got.\"\n\nThat's what Will Campbell said last April after he was drafted by the New England Patriots with the fourth overall pick. And with that, he quickly endeared himself to fans, showing that he was willing to do whatever it takes to protect Drake Maye.\n\nCampbell has done an impressive job all season, despite a few bumps and bruises along the way, including a short stint on injured reserve. So, with only one game remaining this season, the starting left tackle reflected on these comments and how that signified the start of a close bond between him and Maye.\n\n\"I had a lot of emotions running through me that night. I was excited,\" he recalled. \"One of the reasons I wanted to come here was to block for him. So it's been awesome, not only being here, but getting to know him, building a relationship with him.\"\n\nAnd with that, Maye has been able to help Campbell with the hard transition to the NFL, having just gone through it himself one year prior.\n\n\"It's been awesome. He was in the same position as me last year, a long way from home, living by himself,\" Campbell explained. \"And him and his wife have been very welcoming to me and my family. His family's awesome. So I'm just super thankful for him.\"\n\nSo, does the saying still ring true?\n\nFollow Patriots Wire on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Patriots Wire: Will Campbell reflects on viral draft night quote ahead of Super Bowl",

    "fullText": "Elias Pettersson is closing in on a Vancouver Canucks single-season franchise record. The 27-year-old center has recorded 81 blocked shots in 48 games and is on pace to shatter the franchise record for blocked shots by a forward in a single season. The current record is held by Nick Bonino, who recorded 90 during the 2014-15 campaign.\n\nAs for the all-time record for blocked shots by a forward in a single season, that is another record Pettersson could set this season. The current record is held by Alex Tuch, who recorded 113 during the 2024-25 campaign. Since the stat started being tracked in the 2005-06 season, only 10 forwards have recorded over 100 blocked shots, which includes current Canucks GM Ryan Johnson, who recorded 105 during the 2007-08 season.\n\nPettersson already ranks top 10 for blocked shots in franchise history. In 519 games, he has blocked 460 shots, which ranks ninth.

    "title": "5 Of The World's Worst F1 Courses (According To Racing Fans)",
    "description": "F1 travels the world, yet some venues draw criticism for dull races and awkward layouts. Fans weigh in on the circuits that frustrate drivers and viewers.",
    "fullText": "Very few sports generate as much thrill as Formula 1. Seeing the fastest drivers in the fastest cars in the world going flat out for what's now 24 weekends a year remains arguably the greatest spectacle in all of motorsport, but there are a few important factors that determine whether that's achieved on a regular basis. The biggest talking point for modern F1 is that the cars themselves aren't great for wheel-to-wheel racing, which is certainly a fair argument. The new regulations are designed to help promote close action, so hopefully we won't need to have that discussion as often going forward.\n\nEqually as important for generating competitive racing, though, are the tracks that they race on. As mentioned, F1 races at 24 different locations, with a wide variety of track styles present on the calendar. Before the season even starts, there are a few circuits that fans look forward to, for example, Silverstone and Interlagos. However, F1 has to follow the biggest and longest contracts to decide which tracks to race on, which aren't always best suited for the pinnacle of open-wheel racing. Fans of the sport don't hold back on their views of some of these circuits, and based on posts online, there's consistency regarding which ones are the most disliked. Looking at the wide array of posts on forum sites such as Reddit, here's a look at five tracks that are often a talking point for all the wrong reasons.\n\nEven if NASCAR has remained at the top of American motorsport, Formula One has long had a presence in the U.S., hosting races at iconic tracks such as Indianapolis, as well as various street circuits like Dallas, Detroit, and, most recently, Las Vegas. While the Circuit of the Americas in Austin has been on the calendar since 2012, Vegas was introduced in response to the recent surge in popularity of the pinnacle of open-wheel racing. A year earlier, the Miami International Autodrome was constructed around Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nAs one of the hybrid street-style circuits, Miami incorporates quite a few different elements from established tracks, with Sector 1 full of sweeping fast turns, followed by a long back straight before the incredibly tight beginning of Sector 3. It might sound good, but the layout is restricted by the stadium grounds to a significant degree. Compared to the tracks it takes inspiration from, many fans feel that it's terrible for actual racing, with the flow constantly being interrupted. Reddit users go as far as to say the Miami Autodrome is \"utterly soulless.\"\n\nThe Lusail International Circuit is one of the more unique venues for F1 at the moment, albeit for a different reason than any other track. First used in 2004, the Qatar track was designed for MotoGP. Of course, MotoGP bikes are massively different to control than an F1 car, with next to no downforce and an emphasis on rider balance and corner exits. As a result, the track features a variety of corners that are long and swooping on a MotoGP bike, promoting great side-by-side action. But for F1, the cars go through these sections so fast that it's a challenge to remain close to the car in front.\n\nIn DestinationFormula1's collection of fan feedback, this was a big issue that fans had with the Lusail circuit. Hopefully, the upcoming 2026 regulations can help solve this by reducing the dirty air given off by cars, but we'll have to wait and see. Similar to Miami, users on Reddit use the word \"soulless\" again to describe the track, but with MotoGP often providing thrilling action here, it just doesn't seem to be as well suited for four-wheeled cars.\n\nThe second Middle Eastern track featured here, the Yas Marina Circuit, has hosted the final race of the season since 2010 and has been on the calendar since 2009. Over the years, we've been treated to some thrilling title deciders at the Abu Dhabi track, many of which have been some of the most memorable races of those seasons. However, it's not necessarily the track itself that generates the excitement, with fans often finding races at Yas Marina to be lackluster when there's nothing at stake.\n\nFor the 2021 season, changes were made to the circuit in a bid to improve racing, namely the removal of two of the stop-start chicanes in Sectors 1 and 2 that some fans felt completely ruined the flow of the circuit. But still, the main overtaking zones remain the two long straights, which start after two corners that modern F1 cars struggle to follow closely through. Outside of the racing itself, other fans are also critical of the track because of the lack of atmosphere. The Abu Dhabi GP is very much intended to be a spectacle, but it doesn't exactly match the feel you get at Monza, Silverstone, or Zandvoort, for example.\n\nWhile other tracks on this list have been added to the sport quite recently, the calendar is also packed with venues that have essentially become staples of F1. Some of these tracks are ones that fans believe shouldn't ever be taken out, and the same can be said for all of them. The Spanish Grand Prix has taken place at the Circuit De Barcelona Catalunya ever since its introduction in 1991, and it instantly made a great impression with Senna and Mansell going wheel to wheel down the main straight. As F1 has developed over the years to become faster and faster, though, the track hasn't managed to keep up.\n\nCircuit De Barcelona Catalunya has just about every corner type you could have on a modern circuit, which makes it no surprise that it's used extensively for testing. But for actual racing, the never-ending flow of corners creates what one Reddit user calls \"stalemate racing.\" The removal of the final chicane has allowed cars to follow better down the straight, but in general, that's a pretty fair description. This is another track that'll hopefully reap the benefits of the smaller cars in 2026.\n\nAnd now for, without a doubt, the most controversial track in Formula 1, Circuit de Monaco. The Monte Carlo street track is one of four current tracks that were used for the inaugural season back in 1950, alongside Silverstone, Spa-Francorchamps, and Monza. Due to this, the history that Monaco holds for F1 can't be denied. But because of how big F1 cars are now, the opportunities for overtaking are virtually non-existent. It's been like this for decades, though, with Mansell finding no way past Senna despite having much fresher tires in 1992.\n\nQualifying has always been Monaco's moment to shine. The constant risk of crashing makes it a thrilling watch, and drivers such as Fernando Alonso call it \"one of the best moments of the season\" when speaking to ESPN. On race day, though, fans think the street circuit is simply \"not suited for modern racing,\" as one Reddit user puts it. For the 2025 race, two pit stops were made mandatory, but all that did was make drivers back each other up to open a pit window for their teammates. The heritage, combined with the challenge, makes it one of the races that drivers want to win more than most, but from the outside, the heritage is the only thing that keeps it on the calendar.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "The Detroit Tigers lost one of their most enduring symbols of toughness and dependability with the passing of Mickey Lolich, a pitcher whose career embodied an era when durability, competitiveness, and responsibility defined greatness.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Tigers lost one of their most enduring symbols of toughness and dependability with the passing of Mickey Lolich, a pitcher whose career embodied an era when durability, competitiveness, and responsibility defined greatness.\n\nLolich was never flashy. He didn’t rely on mystique or velocity spikes or modern metrics to carve out his place in baseball history. Instead, he showed up—again and again — and took the ball for Detroit, often more than anyone else in the league. In a franchise rich with Hall of Famers and iconic figures, Lolich’s legacy rests on something more elemental: trust. When the Tigers needed innings, wins, or stability, Lolich was there.\n\nSigned by Detroit out of high school in Oregon, Lolich debuted in 1963 and spent the heart of his prime anchoring Tigers rotations through the 1960s and early 1970s. Those years were not easy ones to pitch in. Offense surged across baseball, workloads were heavy, and pitchers were expected to finish what they started. Lolich didn’t just survive in that environment; he thrived.\n\nFrom 1964 through 1975, Lolich was one of the most durable starters in the American League. He routinely led the league in games started, innings pitched, and strikeouts, posting season after season of 40-plus starts at a time when pitching every fourth day was standard. His calling card was a heavy fastball and a devastating curveball, a combination that allowed him to rack up strikeouts while still working deep into games.\n\nThat durability reached its apex in 1971, a season that stands as one of the most impressive workloads by any pitcher in modern Tigers history. Lolich started 45 games, struck out more than 300 hitters, won 25 games and posted an elite run-prevention profile despite carrying one of the heaviest inning totals of the era. By modern measures, it was an ace-level season, an 8.5 WAR campaign built not just on dominance, but on sheer volume and resilience.\n\nYet to reduce Lolich’s Detroit career to numbers alone misses the point. He pitched for Tigers teams in transition — contenders, retooling clubs and everything in between — and served as a stabilizing force regardless of circumstance. While others came and went, Lolich remained a constant presence, taking the mound with little fanfare and even less complaint.\n\nThat reliability was never more evident than in October.\n\nLolich’s name will forever be linked to the 1968 World Series, when he delivered one of the greatest postseason performances in franchise history. Facing Bob Gibson and the St. Louis Cardinals, Lolich won three games in the series, all complete games, helping lead Detroit to its first championship since 1945. It was a defining moment not only for his career, but for the identity of the Tigers themselves — a team built on pitching, defense and toughness.\n\nIn many ways, Lolich represented the bridge between eras. He pitched alongside stars like Denny McLain and later carried the staff as the Tigers aged out of their late-1960s peak. When McLain’s career unraveled, it was Lolich who absorbed the innings, pressure and expectations that came with being “the guy.”\n\nDetroit fans appreciated that. Lolich was never a self-promoter. He wasn’t chasing accolades or headlines. He pitched with a workmanlike demeanor that resonated in a city that values effort as much as excellence. He fit Detroit because he reflected it — blue-collar, stubbornly competitive and proud of the work itself.\n\nToday’s game looks nothing like the one Lolich dominated. Pitch counts are monitored, starts are limited, and 45-game workloads are unthinkable. That only makes his career more remarkable in hindsight. Lolich didn’t just pitch in a different era — he defined what was possible within it.\n\nAs Detroit remembers Mickey Lolich, it does so not just for the championships, strikeouts, or awards, but for the standard he set. He showed what it meant to carry a franchise, to answer the bell, and to take pride in the responsibility of pitching for Detroit.\n\nA tip of the cap to a true Tigers original.\n\nFollow me on \"X\" @rogcastbaseball",

    "description": "Here’s what Kyle Whittingham had to say about two elite incoming Michigan freshmen — RB Savion Hiter and DE Carter Meadows",
    "fullText": "With it being National Signing Day, Michigan head coach Kyle Whittingham spoke with Mike Hall on the Big Ten Network. Whittingham was asked about two of Michigan’s signees (who committed in December), running back Savion Hiter and defensive end Carter Meadows.\n\nWhittingham on Meadows: “Big, good-looking young man. 6-foot-7, one of the top defensive ends in the country, if not the top. Tremendous athlete. The length, as I mentioned, is a big positive for him. Had some good conversations with Carter. Young man out of Maryland. And we’re excited to get him here in June.”\n\nMeadows ranked as the No. 9 overall recruit in the 2026 class and the No. 1 player out of Washington, DC, per the 247 Sports Composite Rankings. Meadows had 62 tackles as a senior with seven sacks, two forced fumbles, and one fumble recovery.\n\nMichigan hasn’t really had an edge rusher like Meadows, who is tall with a massive wingspan and possesses great burst and power. Meadows has a style reminiscent of Jevon Kearse, whose nickname is “The Freak.” While Meadows is just a freshman, he could receive a steady amount of snaps this season as a rotational piece behind John Henry Daley and Cam Brandt. If Meadows fares well early in the season, he’d be hard to keep off the field. If his film winds up looking anything like how he played in high school, Meadows will be a collegiate star.\n\n#Michigan five-star EDGE commit Carter Meadows (@CarterMeadows_) has some of the best senior film I’ve seen this cycle. \n\nMust watch highlights 🍿 pic.twitter.com/TGcyGy38Ky\n\n— Brice Marich (@BriceMarich) November 6, 2025\n\nWhittingham on Hiter: “Savion, maybe the best back coming out this year. He was a tremendously highly rated player, and he’s here now. He’s doing a great job, we’re in the workouts, and he’s doing very well. Really excited to see what he can do in spring ball.“\n\nWith Justice Haynes transferring to Georgia Tech, Hiter could have a significant role behind RB1 Jordan Marshall. Hiter, a five-star prospect, ranked as the No. 21 overall player in the 2026 class and No. 2 running back. Hiter missed three games last season and still rushed for 1,440 yards and 24 touchdowns in his senior season. Hiter looks like a bruising running back that also possesses elite speed. He was bigger, faster, and stronger than his high school competition and would either blow past defenders in the open field or truck them instead.\n\n5⭐️ Michigan RB signee Savion Hiter pic.twitter.com/TapyAO0e2v\n\n— uofmcoverage (@uofmcoverage) December 4, 2025",

Expect a playbook that stays fluid, attacking an opponent's specific weakness rather than sticking to a script.\n\nReisland noted that Monken \"can maximize whatever these QBs can do.\" With a room featuring the dynamic Shedeur Sanders and Deshaun Watson, Monken won't lean on a one-size-fits-all approach. He specializes in tailoring passing windows and pocket movement to fit his signal-caller’s natural rhythm.\n\nThe message to the locker room is clear. If you can help this team find the end zone, Monken will find a way to use you.

Eyes closed.\n\nThat is how Stefon Diggs will spend some of his final moments prior to kickoff of the first Super Bowl of his career.\n\nIt’s been a staple of the wide receiver's routine before each game he’s played this season for the New England Patriots.\n\nFollowing pregame warmups, he also calls his teammates in to huddle around him as he leads one of a series of impassioned, fiery and often viral speeches.\n\n“I just say what I feel like I’m supposed to do and just go,” Diggs said. “It’s not so much the words, it’s more so the tenacity.”\n\nThen, he turns the volume down for his prayer in the corner of the end zone.\n\n“Taking a second to kind of appreciate where I am and give my thanks to God and kind of have my little moment with him. Thanking him for the trials and tribulations,” Diggs said. “Building my character up a little bit as a person and making these shoulders weight-bearing, I guess.”\n\nBoth are necessary for the player whom teammates call the emotional centerpiece of their Super Bowl run. And for Diggs, it’s been fuel during a comeback season that didn’t seem likely after his tenure in Houston last season was cut short by a knee injury.\n\nBut, after posting his seventh 1,000-yard receiving season in his 11th year in the league, he may also be the not-so-secret weapon for an offense that will need to be at its best against a Seattle defense that allowed an NFL-low 17.2 points per game during the regular season.\n\nSo many of the things that got Diggs to this point stemmed from an initial sense of trust he found early in his free agent process last summer.\n\nWhen Diggs signed with Houston in 2024, he acknowledged it was in an effort to chase a championship. But Diggs purposely didn’t have many expectations after signing in free agency with New England.\n\nWhat drew him initially to the Patriots was a sense of trust he felt after finding an almost instant connection with wide receivers coach Todd Downing, who was the tight ends coach in Minnesota in 2018 when Diggs was there.\n\nHe got the same thing from the “straight shooter” he met in coach Mike Vrabel, as well as offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels. It was McDaniels whom Diggs credits with unlocking a work ethic he hadn’t had during his pro career.\n\nMcDaniels said the veteran receiver has been the perfect match for second-year quarterback Drake Maye.\n\n“I think it’s great for Drake to be around a player as accomplished at Stef,” McDaniels said. “Drake has learned how to assimilate with him, (to) work together with a player that has been around a long time and been around a lot of good quarterbacks. I think it’s been great for Drake’s growth and development.\"\n\nAfter Diggs eclipsed 1,000 yards during New England’s regular-season finale, a win over Miami, Maye’s mind went back to the preseason when he invited all the receivers to his home state of North Carolina for some throwing sessions.\n\nHe didn’t think someone as “big time” as Diggs would have time to participate. But he did.\n\n“Kind of from that point on, I felt like, man, looking forward to getting with him on the field and seeing him do his thing, and he’s done his thing time and time again,” Maye said. “Some games he’s not getting the ball as much as any receiver would want to, and he’s still trying to block hard and keeps the energy up and breaking the team down and motivating me.\"\n\nWide receiver DeMario Douglas said Diggs also has been central to their group bonding.\n\n“Before this season even started we got close,” Douglas said. “That was a big reason of us not being selfish. Of course, we’re all receivers, we all want to touch the ball. But ... like your brothers, your blood brothers, you want to see them do great no matter what. This is how it is in our room.”\n\nDiggs has also created a new Patriots fan along way, thanks to his high-profile relationship with Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B. She has not only been a force cheering for Diggs on social media, but a presence in team owner Robert Kraft’s suite during games.\n\nShe and Diggs also celebrated the birth of a son together in November. It's helped Diggs keep his mind on football after being accused in December of strangulation and other criminal charges in connection with a dispute with his former private chef. Diggs has denied the allegations.\n\n\"She wasn’t a football girl before I converted her over,” Diggs said. “But I’m just thankful to have her in my corner. She’s an amazing woman and continue to build that relationship. ... I just appreciate her. Hopefully build on that and watch that tree grow.”\n\nAs for Sunday, Diggs expects to bring the same voice for his team that he has all season.\n\n“I mean what I say and say what I mean,” Diggs said. “My teammates know that, and the biggest thing is they know I’m trying not to be a ‘rah-rah’ guy. I try to be more show rather than I tell. It’s the fact that I can back my words up with what I say. I try to go as hard as I can to give it everything I’ve got.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Bobby Miller is looking to return in a big way after a couple of disappointing campaigns with the Dodgers.\n\nThe right-hander began his career with the Dodgers in 2023 and served an important role in the rotation, but has struggled to perform over the past two seasons.\n\n“That’s the motivation for me right now, to get back to how I was a few years ago,” Miller said at DodgerFest on Saturday. “I know it’s still in there, and there’s more than that as well.”\n\nMiller was the Dodgers’ best pitching prospect in 2023, ranking as high as No. 2 among all players within the organization.\n\nMiller made 22 starts in his rookie season, posting an 11-4 record with a 3.76 ERA. He pitched 124.1 innings that season, striking out 119 batters in that time.\n\nThe following season, an early shoulder injury kept Miller on the sidelines from April until June. Upon returning, Miller couldn’t quite produce the results fans saw in 2023. He had a 8.52 ERA through 13 starts, walking batters and allowing home runs at more than double the rate he did in the previous season.\n\n2025 didn’t go much better for Miller, as he had a 12.60 ERA through two appearances in MLB. He spent a majority of the season in Triple-A, where he had a 5.66 ERA through 35 appearances.\n\nHe took on a new role as a reliever in Triple-A, and will likely have to continue playing that role if he wants to make his return to MLB. The Dodgers have had issues with their staff staying healthy in the past, though, so if Miller can keep himself towards the top of the pack in Triple-A, he could get another shot in The Show.\n\nThe post Bobby Miller Looking For Bounce-Back Season in 2026 appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "title": "Bears WR review: Grading DJ Moore, Luther Burden in 2025",
    "description": "Our Bears 2025 position reviews continue with wide receiver, a group that experienced ups and downs throughout the season.",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Bears had a magical 2025 season under first-year head coach Ben Johnson, where they went from worst to first with an 11-6 record, NFC North title and the franchise's first playoff win in 15 years. And there's no denying that the future is bright.\n\nWhile the Bears exceeded expectations in their first year under Johnson, there's still plenty of work to be done with this roster, most notably on defense. After overhauling the offense in the trenches and at skill positions, the focus shifts to the defense where the hope is general manager Ryan Poles does the same to round out this unit under defensive coordinator Dennis Allen and form a complete team with a top-five offense.\n\nHere at Bears Wire, we're going position by position through the 2025 Bears and grading every player. Next up is wide receiver, a group that featured a mix of veteran players and youth for quarterback Caleb Williams. DJ Moore and Rome Odunze returned as the top two options, while the Bears added rookie Luther Burden and journeyman Olamide Zaccheaus. The Bears had a balanced group with three players exceeding 650 yards, though it's fair to say they didn't live up to expectations.\n\n2025 stats: 50 receptions, 682 yards, 6 touchdowns; 15 carries, 79 yards, 1 touchdown\n\nComing into the season, questions surrounded DJ Moore and how he would be utilized in Johnson's offense. The playmaking receiver was taking snaps at running back throughout training camp, and some wondered if he would get passed up in the pecking order on passing downs. Those concerns had some validity, as Moore had his worst season statistically in terms of receptions and yards as a pro, but he was paramount to the Bears' success in 2025. Moore made two legendary plays to propel the Bears past the Packers in the regular season and the playoffs, and he came up big on various broken plays to keep Chicago alive. Though Moore isn't living up to his hefty salary as the team's WR1, he was durable, a willing blocker, and did a little bit of everything in 2025. We'll see if he sticks with the Bears in 2026 as trade rumors surround him going into the offseason.\n\n2025 stats: 47 receptions, 652 yards, 2 touchdowns; 6 carries, 37 yards\n\nThe Bears surprised many fans on Day 2 of the NFL Draft when they selected Luther Burden III out of Missouri to join a receiving room that already had Moore and Rome Odunze, but Johnson and the front office knew what they were doing. Burden was a player with rare athleticism in college that projected as a first-round pick. The Bears benefitted when he slipped in the second round, and he became one of the most dependable pass catchers the team had late in the season. Burden was used sparingly early on, sans a 101-yard outing where he scored a 65-yard touchdown off a flea flicker in Week 3. As the weeks wore on, Burden started drawing more and more targets from Williams. He made defenders miss in open space constantly and showed off his speed on deep routes. Burden still has plenty to learn, as he struggled at times with certain play calls, but his rookie season can only be described as a rousing success.\n\n2025 stats: 44 receptions, 661 yards, 6 touchdowns\n\nHopes were high for Odunze heading into Year 2 of his NFL career. After producing as a rookie on a disjointed offense, he was set to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new system being put in place, as well as new coaches like Antwaan Randle El, and his continued connection with Williams. The duo made it known early that they were ready to grow together early in the season when they combined for 470 yards and five touchdowns through seven games. The production was great to see, though Odunze struggled with drops and wasn't always on the same page as his quarterback. Unfortunately, his production dipped after he was diagnosed with a stress fracture in his foot, which eventually forced him to miss the final five regular season games of the year. Odunze returned for the postseason but wasn't 100% healthy and struggled at times. Despite the fast start, the former No. 9 overall pick failed to live up to expectations in 2025.\n\n2025 stats: 39 receptions, 313 yards, 2 touchdowns; 4 carries, 25 yards\n\nThe Bears brought in Olamide Zaccheaus on an affordable one-year deal last offseason as a depth receiver behind Moore and Odunze. He quickly earned the trust of Williams in training camp and became a dependable target early in the year. Zaccheaus was the team's WR3 for half a season, and while he was credited by his teammates for doing the unsung work on offense, he struggled mightily with drops. Eventually, Zaccheaus saw his snaps and targets diminish due to the emergence of Burden. He totaled just 87 yards over his last 10 games. Zaccheaus was a decent role player in 2025 and held the WR3 spot warm until Burden got up to speed. It remains to be seen whether or not Zaccheaus returns in 2026.\n\n2025 stats: 2 receptions, 26 yards\n\nAnother free agent acquisition in 2025, Devin Duvernay filled the Bears' void on special teams at punt and kick returner, while showing up occasionally on offense as a receiver. Duvernay logged just 40 total snaps on offense and wasn't a factor outside of two games where he caught a pair of passes for first downs.\n\n2025 stats: 6 receptions, 87 yards, 2 touchdowns\n\nWho would have thought the Bears' preseason hero would have one of the best moments of the season in a pivotal December matchup? Jahdae Walker, an undrafted free agent, scratched and clawed his way onto the final roster at the end of August following a stellar training camp and preseason, though he rarely saw the field for much of the regular season. Walker was a healthy scratch most of the time, only participating in special teams until the Bears' Week 16 matchup against the Packers. Due to injuries at the position, Walker finally got his shot and made the most of it with a game-tying touchdown to force overtime. Walker followed that up with two more productive outings to end the season. We'll see what his future holds, but for someone who wasn't expected to play any sort of role, Walker delivered when it counted the most.\n\nOn paper, the Bears' wide receivers looked like one of the deepest groups in the league. They had a solid mix of veteran experience and youth that could grow together with one of the best receiver coaches in the league. While the group produced three players with more than 650 yards in a balanced attack, they committed too many drops that stalled drives throughout the season. Williams lost 404 yards due to drops by his pass catchers, per NFL Next Gen Stats. And the season ended on a sour note for the group when it looked like both Moore and Odunze were late getting to their spots on the final offensive play of the divisional round game against the Los Angeles Rams. All in all, it's a talented group that may have a star in the making in Burden. If Odunze can bounce back in 2026, those two will be a solid duo for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Bears WR review: Grading DJ Moore, Luther Burden in 2025",

    "description": "The Athletic reports it was Jeff Stoutland's decision to step down as Eagles offensive line coach. With so many connections, the Saints are a good fit",
    "fullText": "Jeff Stoutland is stepping away as the Philadelphia Eagles' offensive line coach, a position he held since 2013, and it would make a ton of sense for the New Orleans Saints to recruit him. Beyond developing young offensive tackles Kelvin Banks Jr. and Taliese Fuaga, his presence could be transformative for Pro Bowl center Erik McCoy just like it was for Jason Kelce. But is there a real chance the Saints could pull it off? What does Stoutland's immediate future look like?\n\nNFL Network's Mike Garafolo wrote that \"The plan is for Jeff Stoutland to have some sort of involvement\" with the Eagles as an organization, but Stoutland won't be coaching for them, and it's expected that other teams will at least check in with him. The Athletic's Zach Berman reports that \"The Eagles wanted Stoutland back,\" but it was his decision to step down. For their part, the Eagles issued a long goodbye message on social media, saying that \"it's safe to say he will always be welcome in the City of Brotherly Love.\"\n\nThat sure doesn't sound like he'll be back in Philadelphia wearing a headset and Kelly Green sweatshirt on Sundays. And the Saints have more to offer Stoutland than money. After Kellen Moore spent the 2024 season running the Eagles offense and working with him every day, he brought a lot of Stoutland's coworkers with him to New Orleans. That included Doug Nussmeier (the Eagles' quarterbacks coach), Kyle Valero (an assistant working with the wide receivers), and Stoutland's longtime assistant T.J. Paganetti (who had spent a decade with him in Philly), among others.\n\nSo don't dismiss this out of hand. There's a lot to be said for familiarity. Maybe it can make a difference.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Saints Wire: Eagles coach Jeff Stoutland wanted out of Philly, Saints should pursue",

    "fullText": "Canadian snowboarder Mark McMorris crashed on Wednesday night and had to be stretchered off the course during big air training ahead of the Milan Cortina Games.\n\nIt's unclear what happened exactly, but the Canadian snowboard team described the crash as “heavy” in a statement. Specifics of McMorris' condition are not yet known, either.\n\n“Snowboarder Mark McMorris had a heavy crash this evening during big air training,” the team said in a statement on social media. “Canadian Olympic Committee and Canada Snowboard staff are attending to him. We will provide more information as it becomes available.”\n\nThe 32-year-old is making his fourth Olympic appearance for Canada. Qualifying for the big air competition is set for Thursday night, one day before the Opening Ceremony. It’s unknown if McMorris will be able to compete anymore.\n\nMcMorris has won three bronze medals in his Olympics career. He claimed third in slopestyle in each of the past three Olympics, and he finished in 10th in the big air competition in both the PyeongChang Olympics in 2018 and the Beijing Olympics in 2022. He has won four of his 12 X Games gold medals in the big air competition, too, which was only added to the Olympics in 2018. In the big air competition at the Olympics, riders take off from a ramp that is more than 165 feet tall.\n\nMcMorris, per the CBC, suffered life-threatening injuries after he slammed into a tree during a backcountry ride in 2017. That resulted in him having a rod placed in his leg, a plate in his arm and another plate in his jaw. Despite that and other significant injuries, McMorris said last month that he felt he was in good health entering these Games.\n\nThe men’s big air final is set for Saturday night at the Livigno Snow Park. Qualification for the men’s slopestyle will start on Monday, Feb. 16.",

    "fullText": "Rivalries are the backbone of the NBA. Rivals Week just passed, but the lineup wasn’t up to par. Some fan-favorite matchups are missing, such as the Spurs and Thunder, or the historic Celtics and Lakers, built off the backs of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.\n\nPlayer rivalries build team rivalries. Seeing players go head-to-head to prove who’s the best is what makes the NBA the most entertaining.\n\nWith that being said, here are the four best player rivalries currently taking place in the NBA:\n\nAnytime Lebron faces off with Steph Curry or Kevin Durant, it’s still a marquee matchup. LeBron, Durant, and Curry are a callback to an era now passed. Every time the NBA begins a new season, fans know they are that much closer to these show-stopping battles are coming to an end.\n\nThat means every game is a must-watch. When any combination of these three go head-to-head, it’s apparent how badly they each want to come out victorious over the other.\n\nFrom Finals matchups to random regular-season contests, each of the three give their all when they step on the court against each other.\n\nA different side of LeBron comes out when he faces Dillon Brooks. We’ve never seen a player get under the King’s skin like the Phoenix Suns guard. This rivalry has been filled with trash talk, physical confrontations, and heated moments.\n\nBrooks is averaging a career high of 21.1 points per game and elevates his play every time he goes up against the Lakers. Los Angeles’ last matchup with the Suns ended in a blowout.\n\nIt seems like Brooks has made it his personal mission to mess with the Hall of Famer, and fans are eagerly awaiting their next duel.\n\nChet Holmgren going up against Victor Wembanyama has been one of the NBA’s most compelling feuds as of late.\n\nSince Wembanyama entered the NBA, he and Chet have had a budding rivalry. The two towering figures first faced off in the 2021 FIBA World Cup, where Holmgren and Team USA walked out with the win.\n\nThe Spurs seem to have the Thunder’s number this year, as they’ve beaten them three times this season. It feels like Wembanyama circles every Thunder game on his calendar.\n\nWembanyama is on a mission to prove he’s far and away the best young center in the NBA. The Spurs’ phenom is a generational talent, but Holmgren has something he doesn’t: a championship ring.\n\nEdwards Vs. SGA is a heavyweight fight with the title for best guard in the NBA on the line. The intensity always reaches a fever pitch when these two play each other. The two players mirror each other in many ways. Both became leaders of their team at a relatively young age and became stars around the same time.\n\nAnt and SGA have taken subtle shots at each other through shoe commercials. It’s clear they both have immense respect for each other, but are fighting to be the best. The Timberwolves have won two out of three matchups with the Thunder this season, but these two will be battling it out for years to come.\n\nAttention player haters and disbelievers of all kinds… pic.twitter.com/5tzoBwvUZ4\n\n— adidas Basketball (@adidasHoops) October 24, 2025\n\nThe post What Are the Best Player Rivalries In the NBA Today? appeared first on The Lead.",

    "title": "From Super Bowl speech to run blocking, how Cooper Kupp helped reshape Seahawks",
    "description": "Cooper Kupp’s Seahawks teammates and coaches raved about his impact as they gear up for the Super Bowl against the New England Patriots.",
    "fullText": "Frisman Jackson didn’t waste any time when the Seattle Seahawks signed Cooper Kupp in last spring. The Seahawks receivers coach knew what Kupp represented. He was formerly one of the most productive receivers in NFL history — a Super Bowl MVP after winning the statistical triple crown in 2021 — who had just been cut by the Los Angeles Rams after three straight sub-1,000 yard seasons.\n\nKupp’s perspective, Jackson thought, would be invaluable toward helping his group elevate the Seahawks to make a run to the Super Bowl. The receiving corps was at an inflection point after trading D.K. Metcalf to the Pittsburgh Steelers and releasing Tyler Lockett days before signing Kupp. All while the team was pivoting at quarterback away from Geno Smith toward Sam Darnold.\n\nSo Jackson tapped Kupp to get up in front of the meeting room and offer his perspective to his fellow receivers.\n\n“I had him talk in the front of the group and say, ‘talk to us about your experience the year ya’ll went to the Super Bowl,’” Jackson said. “We’ve been on this mission since before we came for phase one (of the offseason program) when I had him stand in front of the room and talk about what it means to play in the Super Bowl.”\n\nKupp’s words wound up being helpful and prophetic. The Seahawks are in the Bay Area preparing for Super Bowl LX and are 4.5-point favorites over the New England Patriots to lift the organization’s second Lombardi Trophy. They got there on the back of arguably the NFL’s best defense, but there’s little chance they would have earned the No. 1 seed in the NFC and beat the 49ers and Rams in the playoffs without the play of their receivers complementing Darnold’s ascension in his first season with Seattle.\n\n“It’s about playing for each other,” Kupp said. “I think one of the things that I’ve noticed that the best teams I’ve been a part of, guys play for the guy next to them. It’s a cliché thing, but it’s the hardest thing to do when you get to the NFL because there’s so much at stake. And it’s hard for people with their own ambitions, their own families and all this different stuff that’s going on, to commit to the belief that truly the best thing for them and the best thing for our team is that the team succeeds.\n\n“The most powerful thing you can do is have a group of guys that are playing for something outside of themselves and we’ve had a lot of guys embody that this year.”\n\nThe Seahawks haven’t been to a Super Bowl since winning it after the 2013 season. Only four players on the roster have Super Bowl experience. One is Kupp, who caught eight passes for 92 yards and two touchdowns in the 23-20 win over the Bengals in Super Bowl LVI. Two others were his teammates with the Rams: Ernest Jones IV and running back Cam Akers. Darnold served as Brock Purdy’s backup with the 49ers during the loss to the Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII.\n\nThe Seahawks have leaned on Kupp’s experience in their preparation for Sunday against the New England Patriots.\n\n“I can’t speak highly enough of Coop. What he’s meant to our offense, not only our offense but our team. The mindset that he has,” Darnold said. “The way he leads by example. If he does say things, he’s one of those guys where the entire room is dead silent. And they’re super focused on what he’s saying because we know that he doesn’t waste his breath. He’s always going to be able to say something very mindful. For us, speaking for the players, but also the coaches, he’s had a huge impact on all of us in that building. Really fun playing for Coop and what he’s brought to all of us.”\n\nKupp has been a tone setter for his fellow receivers and pushed to raise the standard for players and coaches, Jackson said.\n\n“He challenges you as a coach from a schematic standpoint. He’s going to ask questions and you better know the answers to them,” Jackson said. “You can’t bull crap him.”\n\nJackson said Kupp specifically elevated the conversation about receivers’ blocking in the running game. It stems from Kupp playing for Rams coach Sean McVay, who like Kubiak and other coaches from the Kyle Shanahan tree, emphasizes receivers blocking when they’re not catching passes.\n\nAnd while trying to take the onus off Darnold and playing to their defense, the Seahawks had the third most rushing attempts in the NFL during the season.\n\n“Before I had Coop, when I talked about the run game, it was very limited, because most wideouts say, ‘give me my rule, who I’m supposed to block, and that’s the end of it,’” Jackson said. “With Coop, I’ve really had to be locked in. He’s going to ask me, what’s the Mike point, what’s the call that the O-line is going to and how it affects his block. And so he’s really challenged me in that regard and really changed my coaching style and philosophy and how I teach the run game to the guys.”\n\nKupp’s production isn’t at the same level as his previous Super Bowl season. In 2025, he had modest totals of 47 catches for 593 yards, the second fewest of his career, with just two touchdowns. It was a far cry from the 145 catches for 1,947 yards and 16 touchdowns when he posted one of the great seasons in NFL history in 2021, which he capped by earning Super Bowl MVP for catching a pair of touchdowns in the victory over the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nThe 32-year-old caught a touchdown against his former team in this year’s NFC championship game, with three of his four catches converting third downs in the 31-27 victory. He finished with 36 yards.\n\nBut what Kupp lacked in numbers throughout the season, he made up for in leadership and providing a good example for his teammates, which began with his speech in March.\n\nKupp has helped Jaxon Smith-Njigba grow into one of the game’s most productive receivers. Kupp said Wednesday there were similarities to their games, with Smith-Njigba initially being thought of as a slot receiver before being moved all over the field in 2025. Smith-Njigba had a Kupp-like 1,793 yards to lead the NFL this season.\n\nAsked what advice Kupp gave Smith-Njigba that has stuck with him most: “Process over results,” Smith-Njigba said.\n\nSeattle’s brass moved on from Metcalf and Lockett to allow Smith-Njigba to have a runway to more targets. And Kupp was added because he played in a similar scheme in L.A. that Seattle would run under first-year coordinator Klint Kubiak, who is expected to be named the new head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders after Sunday’s Super Bowl.\n\nKupp had no problem not being Seattle’s top target.\n\n“You got guys who make be locker room lawyers — they might go in a corner somewhere and complain about things. That’s not Coop,” Jackson said. “He’s been fantastic. I could talk hours and hours about the professional that he is, how he goes about his business and how selfless he is.”",

    "description": "Artemi Panarin’s run on Broadway is over. After seven memorable seasons with the New York Rangers, Panarin’s off to Hollywood",
    "fullText": "Artemi Panarin’s run on Broadway is over. After seven memorable seasons with the New York Rangers, Panarin’s off to Hollywood following a trade to the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nPanarin had 607 points (205 goals, 402 assists) in 482 regular-season games over seven seasons with the Rangers, and his 1.26 points-per-game average is best in franchise history. He ranks eighth all-time for the Rangers in assists, ninth in points, and 14th in goals.\n\nHe left behind a treasure trove of memorable highlights in New York, and will be remembered as one of the most exciting players ever to wear the Blueshirts sweater.\n\nLet’s break down the 10 greatest moments for Panarin during his tenure with the Rangers.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin and former Blue Jackets teammate Sergei Bobrovsky are dear friends, but the Breadman made his countryman — and star defenseman Aaron Ekblad — look silly when he dangled around both and snuck a back-hand shot past the Florida Panthers goalie for a highlight-reel goal in the first period in Sunrise, Florida.\n\nWhy it was great: Before arriving in New York, Panarin owned the Rangers, with 12 goals and 18 points in 12 career games. So it was a relief to see Panarin register his first three-goal game in a Blueshirts sweater in Game 31 of his first season. Panarin had an assist on Mika Zibanejad‘s power-play goal that tied the game, then sealed the hat trick with a pair of goals late in the third period of the Rangers’ 6-3 win over the San Jose Sharks.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin scored a career-high four goals against the Carolina Hurricanes, helping the Rangers turn a 2-1 second-period deficit into a 6-2 laugher. He also had an assist to record points on five of New York’s six goals.\n\nWhy it was great: Maybe the last memorable moment for Panarin in a Rangers sweater. With New York up 1-0 late in the first period, Panarin floated a seeing-eye shot past Bobrovsky in the outdoor contest played in Miami. It ended up being the game-winning goal, and Panarin also added an assist in the Rangers’ 5-1 win over the Panthers.\n\nWhy it was great: It’s easy to forget how far the Rangers had fallen and how quickly that drop off was after so much success for most of the 2010s. But the Letter 1.0, authored in February 2018 by then-GM Jeff Gorton and team president Glen Sather, ushered in a rebuild that climaxed earlier than expected when Panarin signed a mammoth seven-year, $81.5 million contract. The Rangers outbid the Islanders and Blues Jackets for his services, and Panarin was worth every penny. He led the Rangers in scoring six straight seasons before traded to the Kings, and the Blueshirts reached the Eastern Conference Final in 2022 and 2024, and won the Presidents’ Trophy in 2023-24 with Panarin a vital member of their core.\n\nWhen: Oct. 12, 2023-Nov. 18, 2023\n\nWhy it was great: The 2023-24 season was undoubtedly Panarin’s best ever, and he started it with a bang by setting the Rangers record for longest season-opening point streak. Panarin had 10 goals and 16 assists, and the Rangers were 12-2-1 in that stretch. That streak set New York on the path toward its Metropolitan Division championship and the franchise’s fourth Presidents’ Trophy. It also started Panarin on the way to 120 points, second most in Rangers history.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin often showed off his Rockettes-style leg kick after big goals, but it all started with this highlight-reel tally against the Detroit Red Wings early in 2020. Panarin dangled around Detroit defenseman Alex Biega then snuck a back-hand shot past Jimmy Howard to put the Rangers up 3-0. He sealed the goal with a kick, which became his signature celebration.\n\nWhy it was great: Playing outside at MetLife Stadium in front of a pro-Rangers crowd crowd of roughly 80,000, the Blueshirts fell behind 4-1 in the second period then trailed 5-3 in the late stages of the third period against the rival Islanders. Yet, Chris Kreider deflected Panarin’s point shot on the power play past Ilya Sorokin to make it 5-4. After Zibanejad tied it with another power-play tally, Panarin sent the Rangers fans into delirium by stealing Noah Dobson’s pass on the opening shift of overtime and beating Sorokin for an emotional 6-5 comeback win, though only after video review upheld his OT winner.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin scored the game-winning goal in Game 1 of the Rangers’ second-round playoff series against the Hurricanes, then had three assists in a 4-3 win in Game 2. But the Rangers coughed up a late 2-1 lead in Game 3 on the road when Andrei Svechnikov tied the score with the net empty at the other end. But Panarin’s hard work paid off early in OT, when he got inside position on Carolina’s Jalen Chatfield and redirected Vincent Trocheck‘s pass by Pyotr Kochetkov for the game-winning goal at 1:43 of the extra session, giving the Rangers a commanding 3-0 lead in the series. The Rangers ultimately claimed the series in six games.\n\nWhy it was great: It had been five years since the Rangers won a series in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, and they looked destined for another early exit after losing a three-overtime classic in Game 1 and fell behind 3-1 to the Pittsburgh Penguins in the best-of-7 first round — especially after they allowed seven goals apiece in Games 3 and 4. But after the Rangers won Games 5 and 6, sending the series to MSG for Game 7, Panarin authored his signature Rangers moment, fittingly on the power play in overtime of the do-or-die game. He dusted off a pass from Adam Fox twice then wristed the game-winner through traffic and past Tristan Jarry, sending the Rangers to the second round.\n\nRangers trade Artemi Panarin to Kings for Liam Greentree, draft picks\n\nEx-Rangers captain Jacob Trouba throws shade, ‘having more fun’ in Anaheim\n\nRangers running out of time to trade Artemi Panarin before NHL roster freeze\n\nRangers coach provides brief Artemi Panarin update, waiting for trade",

    "description": "Patriots wide receiver Kayshon Boutte detailed the ways that teammate Stefon Diggs motivated him to succeed in the 2025 NFL season.",
    "fullText": "New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs has made an impact on WR Kayshon Boutte this season.\n\nBoutte was available at Day 2 of Super Bowl week on Tuesday. He, along with several other players, in addition to coaches, spoke to the media with Super Bowl LX just days away. Boutte was asked about his missed connections with quarterback Drake Maye in the postseason, as well as his struggles on and off the field that he divulged with The Players’ Tribune, among other questions.\n\nPer Blitz Sports Media’s Ryan Linkletter, Boutte gave Diggs his just due when asked about the latter’s impression on the wide receiver room in New England.\n\n“I would say personally for my development, I felt like it was always good to have a great receiver come in. I felt like it always pushed me to be great,” Boutte said. “So I think that’s one thing I told myself in the offseason. Whatever he do, I’m going to match it. Just to try to get myself to where I want to be.”\n\nDiggs was signed by the Patriots after recording six 1,000-yard receiving seasons in six of the seven years before he arrived in New England. The two-time All-Pro receiver opened the field up for Boutte with the attention he garnered from opposing defenses.\n\nBoutte caught a career-high 71.7 percent of his passes in 2025 — up 8.5 percent from 2024 — with additional career-highs in yards per target (12), as well as yards per reception (16.7). Diggs distinguishably improved the three-year veteran’s potential for yardage this season. His work in the locker room paid dividends behind the scenes.\n\nBoth wide receivers look to put a stamp on their dynamic as the featured pass-catchers on the outside for New England with a win at Super Bowl LX on February 8.\n\nFollow Patriots Wire on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Patriots Wire: Kayshon Boutte: Stefon Diggs ‘pushed me to be great’ in 2025",

    "description": "Holders Newcastle United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Manchester City on Wednesday night and a challenging season shows no sign of relenting.",
    "fullText": "Newcastle United players waited impatiently in the tunnel at the Etihad.\n\nIt was three minutes until kick-off and the Carabao Cup holders were desperate to get going as a bemused Kieran Trippier looked around and wondered where his counterparts from Manchester City were.\n\nThere was no sign of Pep Guardiola's team.\n\nThe hosts took their time to emerge from the dressing room, but they quickly left Newcastle in a daze after racing into a 3-0 lead in the second leg of their semi-final.\n\nOn a day CEO David Hopkinson doubled down on his assertion that Newcastle will be competing for the biggest prizes by 2030, the naive visitors looked a long way off in that first half.\n\nHead coach Eddie Howe certainly did not hold back in the away dressing room as he made a triple change at half-time.\n\n\"I was really annoyed,\" he said.\n\nNewcastle managed to rally after the break and pulled one back through substitute Anthony Elanga as they bowed out with a 5-1 defeat on aggregate.\n\nDespite the loss, those 5,400 supporters in the away end repeatedly chanted \"Eddie Howe's black and white army\", in recognition of the head coach who ended the club's seven-decade wait for a major domestic trophy in this very competition.\n\nBut this has been a challenging season for Newcastle and it shows no signs of relenting.\n\nIn truth, Newcastle have yet to catch fire six months into the campaign.\n\nThat may seem a curious statement.\n\nNewcastle have reached a third EFL Cup semi-final in four years.\n\nHowe's side remain favourites to progress past Qarabag into the last 16 of the Champions League.\n\nThey could still get back to Wembley through the FA Cup - even if an awkward fourth-round tie against Aston Villa awaits next week.\n\nBut Newcastle sit in 11th place in the Premier League.\n\nThe players previously spoke among themselves about trying to make history once again by becoming the first Newcastle side to qualify for the Champions League in successive campaigns.\n\nHowever, this travel sick team have only won two away games in the top flight this season.\n\nHowe's men have picked up just 11 points from a possible 36 against those sides currently above them in the division.\n\nThey have dropped 16 points from winning positions.\n\nIt has felt like a season of transition, following the damaging departure of top scorer Alexander Isak, and Howe's response was telling when asked if he could tolerate such a word this week.\n\n\"I can,\" he said. \"Transition from the team is an obvious one because we brought players in from the summer and we lost players in the summer.\n\n\"There was always going to be a change to the team. Now change doesn't have to be negative - it can be positive. We are trying to find that flow and rhythm that we have been searching for all season, really.\n\n\"In terms of the club, it's growing and changing all the time and I think will continue to change in the next few years, probably at a rapid pace at some stage. The club is definitely in transition - but transitioning for the positive in my opinion.\"\n\nThere have certainly been glimpses of what this team could be in recent weeks.\n\nThere was a devastating first-half display against Chelsea, a spirited hour away to Paris St-Germain and a fine opening half an hour or so at Anfield.\n\nBut games are not won in snatches.\n\nIt has been a frustration of the coaching staff that they have lacked the training time during an unrelenting run of fixtures to really work on things and piece it all together like they have during previous sticky spells.\n\nInstead the players have come to rely on meeting rooms, analysis sessions and walk-throughs.\n\nThis is the reality of life at clubs who aspire to fight on multiple fronts, of course, but competing in four competitions was an unprecedented feat for Newcastle going into February.\n\nThe relentless nature of the schedule has had a knock-on effect on the squad - Bruno Guimaraes, Joelinton, Tino Livramento and Fabian Schar are all currently sidelined, while Anthony Gordon hobbled off with a hamstring issue on Wednesday night.\n\nIt has also had an impact on the adaptation of Newcastle's summer signings who, aside from defender Malick Thiaw, are still finding their feet at the club.\n\nThiaw, Jacob Ramsey, Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa all joined in the final fortnight or so of a turbulent window, in which the club operated without a sporting director and missed out on a host of top targets.\n\nNewcastle, remarkably, are still searching for a settled combination in the final third despite spending £179m on forwards.\n\nElanga enjoyed a lively second-half cameo at the Etihad, but Woltemade was substituted at half-time - having failed to score since December - while the rusty Wissa missed a host of good chances in both legs.\n\nIt leaves Newcastle with more questions than answers as they embark on a crunch run of fixtures.\n\n\"Where does that leave our season?\" Howe asked. \"We're still fighting on several fronts.\n\n\"The games are coming thick and fast. There's no let-up for us. We need to get back to winning ways as quickly as possible. It's the only thing that gives you new energy.\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

He wants to retire with the Milwaukee Bucks\n\nGiannis dunking in front of Benny the Bull instead of Bango would not be the kind of inside stuff trade news Bucks nation could accept.\n\nBut before anybody gets too worked up about Antetokounmpo being traded 90 minutes south, there's a reason for this absolute madness.\n\nGiannis to Chicago is now down to +275 \n\nOne bettor has a series of bets at various odds that would turn $1,075 into $22,575 if Giannis is traded to the Bulls before the deadline 👀 pic.twitter.com/xGrd8esXth\n\n— DK Insights (@DKInsights_) February 2, 2026\n\nBecause trade bets like this have limited action, it does not take a large wager to move the action considerably.

    "description": "\"WWE SmackDown\" star Kit Wilson recently sat down with Chris Van Vliet and explained some of the inspiration behind his new, viral theme music.",
    "fullText": "Kit Wilson, formerly of Pretty Deadly, is doing a fantastic job of making a name for himself outside of the tag team while Elton Prince is on the shelf following neck surgery. Part of the way he's doing it, in addition to his gimmick denouncing toxic masculinity, is a catchy new theme tune that has taken social media by storm.\n\nWilson told Chris Van Vliet on his \"Insight\" podcast that he was hoping the song would be catchy, but he didn't realize how popular it would be. He explained that he had a fair amount of input into the song, and was pushing for new music when he found out he'd be going solo.\n\n\"I started messaging a lot saying, 'I would love new music. Can I get new music?'\" he explained. \"Then, eventually I got into contact with Neil [Lawi], I believe, and then he called me. We had a little discussion on the phone. He said, 'What kind of thing are you looking for?' So I said, 'Can I send you an email?' Got off the phone and I started writing this email, just with all my references. With all the songs I like. All the ideas I had. Lyrics. Kind of the theme of it, the vibe of it.\"\n\nWilson explained he timestamped bits of songs he liked and sent them off to the music producers. The phone call that opens his theme is inspired by a Charlie XCX and Billie Eilish song that opens the same way, though he said he initially asked for an English voice for the \"Hey Kit, are you there?\" Other influences included \"Like Jennie\" by Black Pink and \"Femininomenon\" by Chappell Roan, in addition to some Harry Styles influence.\n\nWilson's new theme caught fire during his January 2 \"WWE SmackDown\" match against Matt Cardona, kicking off the pair's feud. The star has been on his own since Prince suffered an injury during a match in May 2025. He explained Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque asked him if he wanted new music, and Wilson said as much as he cherishes Pretty Deadly, it was time to move on.\n\n\"I was scared, but I just felt like if we're going to this new chapter, we have to go,\" he said. \"So I said, 'I want to get rid of all that.' Then, obviously, if it comes back, it comes back. But I just wanted to start new.\"\n\nThe star appears to be having a blast with his new song, as much as the crowd and those on social media. He can be seen singing along to the music during his entrance, and he told Van Vliet while he loves a \"little lip sync moment,\" it hasn't been easy.\n\n\"I have been struggling,\" he said. \"The crowd makes noise, which has been really annoying, because I can't hear my music. I can't sing along... But, I love the music. I love the lyrics, and again, with the email, there were certain words and certain lyrics. I wanted 'Pretty Deadly' in there. I wanted some kind of reference. So there's just little Easter eggs in it.\"\n\nIf you use any quotes from this article, please credit \"Insight with Chris Van Vliet\" and provide a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "New Dolphins offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik isn't trying to tear the offense Mike McDaniel built down to its studs.",
    "fullText": "Bobby Slowik isn't planning on tearing the Miami Dolphins offense down to the studs and rebuilding it from scratch. The team's new offensive coordinator, who spent last season as its senior passing game coordinator, says his unit won't look too different than it did during Mike McDaniel's time as head coach.\n\n\"We're all from the same [coaching] tree,\" Slowik told reporters Wednesday. \"The way I like to frame it is very similar to like the bones are the same, the roots are the same, but all the trees grow different. A lot of that has to do with the players you have on any given team, which changes year to year. I think a lot of people don't realize how much even within a specific offense, your offense morphs and changes year to year, and that's dependent on the people you have on that team at that time.\n\n\"I believe in running the ball, believe strongly in running the ball. I think most of the successful teams in the NFL these days run the ball really well at a high clip and really build it from there as far as you got to win in the trenches. I like keeping the defense off balance. It’s probably my No. 1 thing as far as what I look for as a play caller, while making sure I marry it to who we have on the team. Then in the pass game, we're all about precision and detail.\"\n\nWhile new Dolphins general manager Jon-Eric Sullivan has a lot of work to do to get the team back on track, there's a good chance much of the Miami offense will still look the same. The team has a star running back in De'Von Achane, a top wide receiver in Jaylen Waddle, and at least a couple of starting offensive linemen already in place with Patrick Paul at left tackle and Aaron Brewer at center.\n\nSlowik doesn't want to change too much about the Dolphins run game, which has included fullback Alec Ingold for the last four years.\n\n“Yeah, we have Alec (Ingold) on the roster, and I would love if Alec was able to stay here,\" Slowik said. \"I think that'd be awesome. I think he's a fantastic leader. I've used a fullback before. I think it's powerful within the offense. I don't think it's required. I think you just need to make sure you have good players and Alec is a good player. So obviously having him here would be fantastic.”\n\nThe big question, however, is what the Dolphins will do at quarterback. While Slowik said that Tua Tagovailoa could \"absolutely bounce back\" from his rough 2025 season, it'd be a surprise if the quarterback is still in Miami by the end of the offseason. The only other Dolphins passers under contract for the 2026 season are Quinn Ewers and Cam Miller.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Dolphins Wire: Dolphins offense will have 'same bones, same roots' under Bobby Slowik",

    "fullText": "“Lokdog” plans to eradicate his opponent.\n\nSurging Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Bantamweight contender Vinicius Oliveira will headline his first UFC event when he takes on Mario Bautista in the main event of UFC Vegas 113 this weekend (Sat., Feb. 7, 2026) inside the UFC Apex in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nAnd if Oliveira has his way, it won’t be a long night.\n\nSpeaking with MMAMania.com during UFC Vegas 113 media day, the Brazilian contender suggested the matchup was designed with a clear purpose: eliminating Bautista, who has drawn criticism for his grinding, low-output style — something Oliveira believes the promotion is ready to move on from.\n\n“I think the UFC made a good choice, a good matchup because he’s a boring fighter, and I think the UFC wanted to put him out,” Oliveira said. “They put me here for the chance to put him out.”\n\nOliveira didn’t stop there, predicting a first-round knockout to cap off the biggest opportunity of his UFC career.\n\nWith a victory, “Lokdog” would claim Bautista’s No. 9 ranking at Bantamweight — and in Oliveira’s mind, that puts him on a fast track to title contention.\n\n“I see myself by the end of the year fighting for the belt for sure,” Oliveira said. “But before that, I’m going to fight against a top five. I’m going to put on a great performance for the audience, and then in the middle of the year I’m going to fight against a top five in the rankings.”\n\nOliveira also hinted at two specific top-five opponents he’d like to face later this year, potentially on the UFC White House card.\n\n“There’s only two guys in the top five that I would be able to fight there. But it doesn’t matter who,” Oliveira added. “I’m going to fight in the middle of the year again, and then this year I’m going to fight for the belt against anyone. It doesn’t matter.”\n\nWhile the Bantamweight title picture is currently logjammed — with champion Petr Yan sidelined until at least July and a trilogy with Merab Dvalishvili looming — Oliveira believes a dominant finish this weekend, followed by a statement win over a top-five opponent, could force the UFC’s hand.\n\nThe 30-year-old has long called for a matchup with Umar Nurmagomedov, even accusing the Russian contender of avoiding him since Oliveira’s incredible UFC debut. Whether that fight materializes later this year remains to be seen.\n\nFor now, Oliveira’s focus is singular: get past Bautista — a notoriously tough out — and do it in emphatic fashion.\n\nFor the rest of the UFC Vegas 113 fight card and Paramount+ lineup click here.",

    "fullText": "We will have one last Colorado Avalanche hockey game before some players head to Milan for the winter games, and it will be against the young, up-and-coming San Jose Sharks at Ball Arena. The Avalanche will be looking to tidy up a bit after a 2-0 defeat suffered at the hands of their old rival, the Detroit Red Wings. The Sharks are currently on a three-game slide, and both teams want to head to the break with a victory, but who will it be?\n\nOne more time! pic.twitter.com/5lPeCr7CBz\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) February 4, 2026\n\nThe Opponent: San Jose Sharks (27-23-4)\n\nWatch: Altitude, Altitude+, ESPN+\n\nListen: Altitude Sports Radio, 92.5 FM\n\nIf this matchup were happening in November of 2025, I’d say there would be just about no shot for the San Jose Sharks to come into Ball Arena and steal points from the likes of Nathan MacKinnon and Co.\n\nToo bad it’s February of 2026, when the boys have been more blue than burgundy, and are 3-5-2 in their last 10 games and have struggled to remain consistent since the calendar turned.\n\nThe Avalanche have been the first team to every increment of 10 total points throughout the season and have led the league most of the way, but that doesn’t paint the whole picture in Colorado. They are an unbelievably effective team at 5-on-5, but still can’t figure out really anything with a man advantage. It has fans and pundits scratching their heads.\n\nTheir net PP% is 10.3. In the last 10 years that ranks 332nd out of 344.\n\n— Mike Kelly (@MikeKellyNHL) February 3, 2026\n\nIt would be just like the Avalanche to tally two or more power-play goals just ahead of the Olympic break, to spite us all.\n\nWe got word this morning that, although they are skating and will represent their respective countries at the Olympics, Martin Necas and Gabe Landeskog will not play this evening.\n\nArtturi Lehkonen — Nathan MacKinnon — Valeri Nichushkin\nRoss Colton — Brock Nelson — Victor Olofsson\nParker Kelly — Jack Drury — Gavin Brindley\nTaylor Makar — Zakhar Bardakov — Joel Kiviranta\n\nDevon Toews — Cale Makar\nJosh Manson — Brent Burns\nSamuel Girard — Sam Malinski\n\nMacKenzie Blackwood\nScott Wedgewood\n\nThe Sharks are a young, promising team led by phenom Macklin Celebrini. This matchup could become a first-round playoff battle if things continue as they have so far in 2025-26, but the two lineups will likely look a bit different by then.\n\nOver Macklin Celebrini’s last 82 games, he’s a 100-plus point player at 19-YEARS OLD 👀 pic.twitter.com/RJJWNpB0gS\n\n— BarDown (@BarDown) January 31, 2026\n\nCelebrini hasn’t just been decent; he’s lighting it up like a cagey veteran scorer, and he’s already shown he’s an elite play driver and scorer at just 19 years of age. He will be the youngest player at this year’s Olympic Games and the youngest Canadian to make Team Canada when NHL players are involved. Impressive stuff.\n\nWill Smith — Macklin Celebrini — Kiefer Sherwood\nWilliam Eklund — Michael Misa — Tyler Toffoli\nPhilipp Kurashev — Alexander Wennberg — Collin Graf\nBarclay Goodrow — Adam Gaudette\n\nMario Ferraro — Timothy Liljegren\nDmitry Orlov — John Klingberg\nShakir Mukhamadullin — Vincent Desharnais\n\nAlex Nedeljkovic\nYaroslav Askarov\n\nFollow along in the comments below!",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Dodgers are World Series favorites heading into the 2026 season, but how does the organization fare in the long-term?\n\nPresident of baseball operations Andrew Friedman spoke on how the Dodgers plan to maintain their success in the future.\n\n“Infusing young players over that time is going to be really important for us to be able to maintain (this level of success),” Friedman said to Jack Harris of the California Post.\n\nThe Dodgers have featured in the playoffs for the last 13 seasons and the team doesn’t plan on messing up that streak in 2026 and beyond.\n\nDespite coming off back-to-back World Series titles in 2026, the Dodgers have the second-best farm system in the league. Their organizational depth is what should carry the Dodgers’ success in the long-term, at least that’s what Friedman hopes for.\n\nThe defending champions have several young players waiting on the sidelines for their big league opportunity, and finding a place for them will be key with an aging Dodgers roster.\n\nThe league’s current CBA is set to expire Dec . 1 and the Dodgers’ recent signing of Kyle Tucker to a four-year, $240 million deal has reportedly infuriated MLB owners heading into the expected labor battle between MLB and the players’ union.\n\nThe Tucker deal has given team owners reason to push for a salary cap, and even if that goal isn’t achieved, the result could be harsher luxury-tax penalties.\n\nThe Dodgers would inevitably be affected by both outcomes as the organization has already paid more than double for every free agent they’ve signed this winter because of tax penalties.\n\nFriedman revealed there’s really no way the Dodgers can prepare for what will ensue.\n\n“There’s just so much unknown around that,” Friedman said. “I’ve now been through a lot of CBAs and have tried to get cute leading into a CBA. Like, ‘OK, this is where it might be going.’ (Right now), we have no idea. We are sitting in the cheap seats on that. So for us, it’s about, whatever the rules are, reading and reacting to it and doing everything we can within the rules to be as good as we can be.”\n\nMore news: Former Dodgers Catcher Austin Barnes Signs With Mets on Minor League Deal",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (17-4, 7-1 SEC) is currently taking on Alabama for a midweek road trip, looking to reach 8-1 in conference play, and stay atop the conference standings before hosting Florida on Saturday afternoon.\n\nFirst-year head coach Bucky McMillan has led the Aggies to their second-best start in SEC play since joining the conference before the 2012 season, and wouldn't be anywhere this season without Spanish sharpshooter Rubén Dominguez, who is averaging 12.9 points per game, 2.4 rebounds, 1.5 assist, and averaging 44.9% from the field, 43.4% frome three-point, and 89.6% from the free throw line.\n\nOne of the best three-point shooters in the country, Dominguez is expected to remain a key part of McMillan's future rosters with two years of eligibility, and in the new age of college basketball, landing international players during the transfer portal period has become a popular trend, and will continue, especially in the SEC.\n\nDuring Dominguez's transition to Texas A&M, McMillan and his staff encountered no issues beyond travel, which took longer than for the other 14 new additions to the roster.\n\nHowever, the drama surrounding former NBA G-League center Charles Bediako, who returned to Alabama late last month, is currently playing vs. Texas A&M, but will be back in court after receiving a temporary restraining order by Judge James Roberts, who has since recused himself from the case.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bediako’s attorneys reportedly sent the NCAA a list of admissions regarding the eligibility of international professional basketball players, including Texas A&M star Rubén Dominguez. Within the document provided by Bama247 writer Mike Rodak, Bediako's legal team listed the Texas A&M sophomore as the 38th example of an international player who was granted eligibility.\n\n\"Admit that you have granted eligibility to Ruben Dominguez, a current student-athlete at Texas A&M University and former member of Movistar Estudiantes from Spain.\"\n\nAlabama is currently 14-7 and 4-4 in SEC play before the conclusion of Wednesday's, and if Bediako isn't granted an eligibility extension, the Crimson Tide will be lacking size in the front court.\n\nBediako’s attorneys sent the NCAA a list of admissions regarding the eligibility of international professional basketball players. pic.twitter.com/Uheimc2BXq\n\n— Mike Rodak (@mikerodak) February 4, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Rubén Dominguez is named in Charles Bediako's eligibility dispute",

After ending his college career at UConn, Kimball was picked up with the 29th overall selection of the 1965 NBA draft by the Celtics.\n\nThe Framingham, Massachusetts native would play the first season of his NBA career with Boston, coming to an end when he was picked up by the (then) San Diego (now, Houston) Rockets in the 1967 NBA expansion draft. His stay with the team lasted until he was dealt to the Milwaukee Bucks in 1971\n\nDuring his time suiting up for the Rockets, Kimball wore only jersey No. 7 and put up 7.3 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 1.4 assists per game.\n\nAll stats and data courtesy of Basketball Reference.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rockets Wire: Rockets jersey history No. 7 - Toby Kimball (1967-71)",

    "fullText": "A hypothesis of schizophrenia is presented that proposes a psychopharmacological model as an addition to the diathesis-stress model. The opioid peptide dynorphin may help bridge together various hypotheses of schizophrenia. The dopamine, glutamate, serotonin, and social defeat hypotheses of schizophrenia are explored. Mechanisms underlying hallucinogenesis and stress overlap, specifically in the opioid system. A psycho-bio-social model for stress-induced psychotic symptoms is explored. As stress impacts one’s affect, amplified salience for affect-congruent memories and perceptions may factor into the development of aberrant perceptions and beliefs. As another mechanism, stress-induced dissociation from important memories about the world that are used to build a worldview may lead one to form conclusions that contradict the missing memories/information.\n\nLater comparisons and contrasts are made with classical psychedelics and THC. Psychedelic mechanisms are explored in relation to this model, notably with clarifications whether they may or may not produce states that mimic endogenous schizophrenic states.\n\nOne of the older theories of mental health is one known as the diathesis-stress model. Its’ basic premise is that increased stress and increased vulnerability to stress through genetics (and probably prior experiences) can manifest in mental health problems. The endogenous opioid system may be involved in determining the valence of experiences, from euphoria, to the dysphoria of stress. Most interestingly, one of the most potent hallucinogens to have ever been found in nature is predominantly an opioid agonist. Specifically, Salvia Divinorum contains salvinorin A which is a kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonist and powerful hallucinogen. The kappa-opioid receptor system is implicated in the stress response and many of the KOR agonists induce very many symptoms of common mental health problems. Dynorphin is the endogenous agent that binds to the KOR system and may help in connecting pharmacology to the diathesis-stress model. At the deep end of the stress response may reside the psychotic state, dissociation, and eventually hallucinogenesis.\n\nThe dynorphins are a group of opioid neuropeptides that are like endorphins but in some sense opposite. Instead of producing effects like euphoria and reinforcement of reward (Roth-Deri, Green-Sadan, & Yadid 2008), the dynorphins induce effects like dysphoria and aversion conditioning (Land et al 2008; Al-Hasani et al 2015). While endorphins predominantly interact with the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) system, the dynorphins interact predominantly with the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) system. If endorphins are seen as a rewarding mechanism, the dynorphins can be viewed as a punishment (aversion) mechanism. Dynorphins seem to be a key component of the dysphoric component of stress and possibly even pain (Land et al 2008; Massaly et al 2019). Expectedly, the dynorphins seem to play a role in many dysphoric and stressful mental health problems including depression, anxiety, drug withdrawals, PTSD, and schizophrenia (Tejeda & Bonci 2019; Knoll & Carlezon 2010; Crowley et al 2016; Chavkin & Koob 2016; Rabellino et al 2018; Clark & Abi-Dargham 2019). The dynorphins seem to play a major endogenous role in fear conditioning and avoidance behaviors (Knoll et al 2011; Donahue et al 2015).\n\nDrugs that stimulate the KOR system are rarely used in medicine due to inducing many problematic effects such as psychosis, anxiety, dysphoria, depression, and hallucinations (White & Roth 2012; Coursey 1978). The infamous hallucinogen Salvia Divinorum appears to work through KOR agonism as its’ main mechanism (Butelman & Kreek, 2015). Many other KOR agonists are hallucinogenic as well, such as ketazocine and pentazocine, which has limited their use in medicine (White & Roth, 2012; Morris & Wallach, 2014; Coursey, 1978). Ketamine also stimulates this system, although it is not its’ main mechanism (Nemeth et al., 2010). It is even thought that acute KOR agonism and subsequent KOR desensitization are required for ketamine’s protracted antidepressant effects (Jacobson et al., 2020). On the other hand, KOR antagonists are found to be euphoric and antidepressant acutely (Jacobson, Browne, & Lucki, 2020). While KOR agonists may have some potential uses in the treatment of psychiatric problems, they often haven’t been favored in medical use due to their depressive and psychosis-like effects.\n\nSchizophrenia is a condition characterized by episodes of positive (hallucinations, delusions, paranoia) and negative symptoms (anhedonia, cognitive problems, memory issues). There is evidence that dynorphin may be useful to understanding schizophrenia. Dynorphin A was found to be elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of schizophrenics and the levels of dynorphin A correlated with symptom severity (Heikkilä, Rimón, & Ternius, 1990). A newer study found elevated serum KORs in schizophrenia which associated to all symptom dimensions (Moustafa et al., 2020). It is worth noting that another study found decreased dynorphin (1–8) (D 1–8) in the CSF of schizophrenics (Zhang et al., 1985). This might suggest a role for specific types of dynorphin in schizophrenia.\n\nThe proposed role of dynorphin/KOR in schizophrenia may be region-dependent, specifically, regions that are hyperdopaminergic in schizophrenia may also show elevated dynorphin/KORs. Another consideration is that there are differential mechanisms that converge on schizophrenic symptoms. Such regional specificity of increased KORs has been observed in a post-mortem study on cocaine overdose cases. The researchers observed double the KORs in the striatum of cocaine overdose victims (Mash & Staley, 1999). Most interestingly, they also observed that those who had delirious effects had elevated KORs in the amygdala. Since cocaine has been observed to induce psychotic symptoms (Tang, Martin, & Cotes, 2014), this is of particular interest. In this article, most focus is on the potential role of striatal and amygdalar dynorphin/KORs in cases of schizophrenia, although other regions are touched upon as well.\n\nDelusions may be partly mediated by the effects of affect on cognition. Specifically, one’s affect may amplify the salience of affect-congruent memories and perceptions. Reward processing is impaired in schizophrenia, with an observed diminished reward processing and intact aversion processing (Cheng et al., 2012; Strauss, Waltz, & Gold, 2014). Individuals with schizophrenia also appear to have a decreased density and availability of mu-opioid receptors (MORs), a receptor-type involved in reward processing (Ashok et al., 2019). This may suggest that dynorphin/KOR agonist signaling is functional, but not MOR agonist signaling, ultimately biasing perceptions towards aversive processing and interpretation, causing one to view the world through a lens of fear, pain, and threat. The negative affective state may induce memory biases that filter judgment towards threatening conclusions and paranoia (Lepage et al. 2007). Paranoia induced by cannabis appears to be “fully accounted for” by the negative affective state (Freeman et al, 2015), which is thought to be mediated by kappa-opioid receptor activity (Ghozland et al., 2002; Zimmer et al., 2001). In later sections, THC is explored. The negative affective state may bias recall of memories and cause one to form conclusions that are biased and absent of information that is key to non-delusional judgment. Dynorphin may play a role in this affect-mediated cognitive process via its’ role in dysphoria.\n\nThe striatum seems to be implicated in delusional and hallucinogenic processes. In a small study, the ventral striatum was found to have increased activity in those experiencing active delusions (Raij et al., 2018). The study found that dopamine activity in the striatum plays a role in the delusional process, which the authors argue is related to altered salience of stimuli. This altered salience of stimuli may be similar to the altered access to episodic memory during affective states, which is arguably a form of altered memory salience. Again, it may be that affect produces self-congruent amplifications of salience. In other words, a negative affect may enhance the salience of negatively affective memories and perceptions. An individual who feels threatened may look at the world with a confirmation bias to discover relevant threatening aspects of the world.\n\nHallucinations may stem from the impact of belief on perception and affect may mediate the strength of belief by promoting the development of delusions through the processes previously outlined. One study found that increased expectations during uncertainty were associated to hallucinations (Cassidy et al., 2018). The authors also found that this was linked to striatal dopamine.\n\nDelusions and hallucinations may be conditioned and involve mechanisms in the striatum and amygdala. Some research has found that auditory hallucinations can be conditioned (Powers, Mathys, & Corlett, 2017). The striatum is involved in conditioning (O’Doherty et al., 2004), so it may be that the salience of stimuli or memories are conditioned by prior experiences and our beliefs. More arousing or strongly valent experiences or beliefs may alter the conditioning of salience. The amygdala plays a role in arousal and valence (Anders et al., 2008) and has been linked to incentive saliency which the authors argued to involve opioid mechanisms (specifically mu-opioid receptors in this particular study) (Mahler & Berridge, 2012). Since KORs exist in the amygdala (Tejeda et al., 2015) and KORs/dynorphin play a role in fear processing and conditioning, KORs may similarly play a role in incentive saliency processes in the amygdala like MORs seem to. These processes may play a role in conditioned saliency and perceptual memory biases that may help explain delusions and hallucinations in schizophrenia.\n\nDissociation is often experienced by those with schizophrenia. Dissociation could be defined as subtraction of subjective experience (or potentially also function). This may occur as a muting of components of subjective experience on a particulate level (perceptions, empathy, feelings, sense of self, etc.). It is thought that trauma can induce dissociative disorders (Lanius et al., 2018). This may be because of the way attention to some stimuli are essentially “punished” by the traumatic experience. Attendance to empathy or certain feelings may cause suffering and escaping this may be protective to one’s feelings. One could also dissociate from external stimuli and become withdrawn into their imagination.\n\nIt is important to note that this idea is separate from affect-congruent saliency of stimuli. In this case, it may be that we turn away from certain kinds of undesirable stimuli because we are rewarded or negatively reinforced to do so.\n\nDynorphin could play a role in endogenous dissociative states, considering that salvinorin A, a dynorphin agonist, produces dissociative states. A recent review paper has explored evidence that dynorphin is a mechanism for trauma-induced dissociation (Lanius et al., 2018). Those with the dissociative disorder known as depersonalization have muted salience for emotional stimuli (Medford et al., 2006). Since dynorphin plays a role in aversion/fear conditioning, it may be involved in conditioned/learned dissociation from extreme stress. Specifically, dynorphin may be implicated in avoidance of attendance to aversive stimuli and may be negatively reinforcing due to the relief that non-attendance provides in the stressful situation. In the case of depersonalization, an individual may learn how to mute the emotional components of stimuli as a way to reduce stress.\n\nKOR agonism may suppress the salience of memories. Salvinorin A seems to cause a suppression of memory for one’s life during the experience. People often forget that they consumed a drug, forget who they are, and even that they are human. Salvinorin A might indiscriminately target KOR neurons, while endogenous dynorphin might target specific neurons based on contexts. For example, memory suppression that seems to occur from traumatic events might be a highly selective form of dissociation, meanwhile salvinorin A might suppress memories indiscriminately. It is possible that certain endogenous conditions cause dynorphin release that is poorly discriminate. This may be especially the case if one becomes hypersensitive to stress, which is explored in the diathesis stress kindling section later.\n\nThis memory suppression could change how we form conclusions about reality, as if we forget to account for information that we should be aware of. For example, the trauma victim may conclude that they have not been abused, when in fact they have. This may set the stage for delusional belief formation.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that individuals may develop tolerance to the subjective feeling of stress or dysphoria, while still maintaining their effects on the salience of memories or perceptions. In this sense, one may not subjectively notice their affect but it may still influence their perception and cognition. Chronic dysphoria may result in mostly behavioral effects such as the flat affect, anhedonia, and altered perception/thinking. I suspect that the subjective noticing of dysphoria is most prominent during the initial transition to the feeling, after which a tolerance to the subjective feeling of the affect develops and one loses the ability to notice their affect.\n\nThere have been a multitude of biopsychological hypotheses of schizophrenia over the years. This section explores the unification of the dopamine, glutamate, serotonin, and KOR hypotheses of schizophrenia. In the later sections, research on the diathesis stress model, social stress, drug-associated psychosis, and seizure-induced psychosis is explored.\n\nThe KOR antagonist buprenorphine was found to be acutely and potently antipsychotic in un-medicated psychotic subjects, with effects lasting about 4 hours before the psychotic symptoms returned (Schmauss, Yassouridis, & Emrich, 1987). Other KOR antagonists like naloxone and naltrexone have also been explored with some beneficial effects (Clark, Van Snellenberg, Lawson, & Abi-Dargham, 2020), though I would suggest that MOR antagonism may be pro-psychotic as well, since there is an observed decrease in the rates of schizophrenia among users of MOR agonists (Chiappelli, Chen, Hackman, & Hong, 2018) and due to the nature of the MOR system having almost diametrically opposed effects to the KOR system (Pan, 1998). Furthermore, KOR agonists are popularly known to be hallucinogenic (White & Roth, 2012; Morris & Wallach, 2014; Coursey, 1978) and produce some of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as anhedonia (Tejeda & Bonci, 2019). Dynorphin has been experimentally tested as a treatment for heroin addiction in humans, in which 25% of the participants experienced crawling hallucinations known as formication (Wen & Ho, 1982). This is interesting because the authors were not exactly testing to see if dynorphin would produce hallucinations, in fact they would hope it doesn’t because this could be a hindrance to the therapeutic potential of their experimental treatment for addiction.\n\nIt is important to consider that, even if endogenous schizophrenic symptoms are mediated by KOR agonism, using KOR agonists as an experimental animal model may not be sufficient. This is because endogenous KOR agonism is not arbitrarily stimulated, but instead is part of a larger context and cause-and-effect stream. As we will explore in the following sections, dopamine, glutamate, and other neurotransmitter activity may be an earlier step in the process and also contribute to the symptomology of schizophrenia too. KOR agonism alone may only partially mimic certain aspects of schizophrenia and be missing other more causal elements that alter the experience. In that sense, KOR agonism alone may produce an extracted or purified set of symptoms that aren’t character of the cocktail of symptoms and mechanisms implicated in endogenous schizophrenic states. As an example, later we will explore how stimulants may produce KOR-mediated hallucinations and psychotic effects, but obviously the subjective effects of stimulants differ greatly from those of salvinorin A. Individuals with schizophrenia are likely living a life that contains some or many of the things that can potentiate KOR-mediated hallucinations, which also produce many other effects than pure salvinorin A alone would. It is likely that a dopamine-induced KOR-mediated hallucinatory state is subjectively different than a simple KOR-mediated hallucinatory state.\n\nStimulant drugs are known to produce psychotic effects, often with repeated use rather than acutely, except in those who have been previously sensitized or have already experienced psychotic effects in the past (Grant et al., 2012; Ujike, 2002). This has helped to contribute to the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia along with dopamine receptor antagonists, known as antipsychotic drugs. Stimulant drugs like amphetamine or cocaine commonly work by stimulating dopamine activity. One dopamine receptor of particular interest is the D1 receptor, which actually stimulates dynorphin increases in the striatum (Solís et al 2021; Hanson et al., 1995; Steiner & Gerfen, 1995). Cocaine, alcohol, nicotine, methamphetamine, and morphine all produce an increase of dynorphin in the striatum after use (Shippenberg, Zapata, & Chefer, 2007; Isola et al 2009; Hanson et al 1988; Nylander et al 1995). Dynorphin is often used to explain the withdrawal symptoms of drugs as well as playing a crucial role in the development of addictions (Bruijnzeel, 2009; Chavkin & Koob, 2016). This connection of dopamine to KOR activity provides a possible mechanism for stimulant-induced psychotic effects, which usually don’t show up on the immediate effect of the drug (except in those previously sensitized), but often after repeated use (Grant et al., 2012; Ujike, 2002). Meanwhile, KOR agonists are acutely psychotic and hallucinogenic.\n\nThe dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia often focuses on D2 receptor hyperactivity and KOR agonism can potentiate the effects of D2 receptor agonism (Escobar et al., 2017). This may help to explain how D2 receptor hyperactivity becomes prominent in schizophrenics. In animals, knockout of D2 receptors prevents the rise in dynorphin in the striatum induced by D1 receptor stimulation (Solís et al 2021). D1 and D2 heteromers localize in dynorphin dense neurons in the striatum. The formation of these heteromer complexes between D1 and D2 in dynorphin neurons is promoted by amphetamine and exists in an elevated state in schizophrenics as well (Perreault et al 2010). It isn’t clear how, but this indicates that D2 receptor activity may somehow facilitate this dynorphin release. It may be the co-agonism of D1 and D2 simultaneously that induces dynorphin release, although this is something that warrants further exploration.\n\nKOR agonism in the striatum may help explain how hallucinations occur in schizophrenia. Dopamine in the striatum has been implicated in hallucinations (Schmack et al., 2021; Cassidy et al., 2018). Dopamine-mediated hallucinations may occur via dopamine-induced dynorphin activity, possibly via the upregulation of these D1-D2 heteromers on dynorphinergic neurons in the striatum. Since stimulants often seem to require some kind of sensitization process in order to induce hallucinations and dynorphin agonist drugs produce strong hallucinogenic effects acutely, the hallucinations caused by dopamine might be related to dynorphin instead. During periods where dopamine activity peaks strongly, we may observe a consequential peak of dynorphin activity that is strong enough to produce positive symptoms like hallucinations and delusions. When this dopamine activity declines, dynorphin activity may also subsequently dip, but still produce negative symptoms like anhedonia, due to excessively diminished dopamine activity, especially in the prefrontal cortex.\n\nMy hypothesis is that the striatum plays a role in managing whether perceptions and thoughts are rewarded or punished (likely through conditioned salience), then facilitating perceptions and thoughts that are successful. As an example, when a child is new to the world, they may have not yet calibrated their visual perception. The erroneous perceptions may lead to failures of reaching goals, such as bumping into a wall because it was closer than expected. Spatial acuity may be conditioned by rewards when we successfully reach goals that we are aiming for. When we fail, perception may be primed for elimination by suppression of the salience of a representation or stimuli. Visual perceptions may stem from reward/aversion-conditioning that tells the brain which perceptual predictions were useful or problematic. Disruptions in detecting reward/aversion may then disrupt perceptual processing as well.\n\nBlocking out memories that contradict a rewarding belief might be negatively reinforcing. If perceiving or thinking something is aversive or punishing, dissociation may suppress the salience of stimuli that lead to the perception or thought. The relief induced by this dissociation could become negatively reinforcing. Dopamine might reinforce delusional ideas and hallucinations, while dynorphins may subtract from stimuli that would ordinarily prevent such delusional or hallucinatory thoughts and perceptions from arising. Dynorphin may suppress information that is critical for developing accurate perceptions or thoughts. Strange hallucinations may also stem from delusional beliefs.\n\nThere is a distinction between dissociating from harmful stimuli to be rewarded and being rewarded for avoiding harmful stimuli via successful anticipation. Affect-congruent saliency may especially play a role in the avoidance of anticipated harmful stimuli, while actively harmful information, such as information that contradicts your belief in a way that leads you to suffer, is dissociated from or loses its’ saliency. In both of these cases, avoidance of harm is shared. One strategy is to manipulate the environment to avoid harm and the other is to dissociate as if the harm is not occurring. There may then be a mix of becoming hypersensitive to detecting threatening stimuli and also dissociation to protect oneself from threats.\n\nIt is important to note that salvia divinorum is acutely hallucinogenic and likely does not seem to rely on conditioned responses. Though, repeated salvia use might induce conditioned responses hypothetically. Acute hallucination and delusion might come from suddenly suppressed internal or external stimuli that leads to an altered view of reality. Important stimuli that inform our conclusions and perceptions of reality could go missing and allow for conclusions and perceptions that contradict the missing information. It may be that salvia strongly disrupts our conditioned salience or even enhances our reaction to already conditioned stimuli. Undergoing repeated episodes of this might lead to conditioned responses.\n\nAnother popular hypothesis for schizophrenia proposes a major role of the neurotransmitter glutamate, specifically an involvement of NMDA receptor hypoactivity (Moghaddam & Javitt, 2012). This led to the use of NMDA receptor antagonists in the study of an animal model of schizophrenia. KOR agonism appears to suppress glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and in a pathway between medial prefrontal cortex and the basolateral amygdala (Tejeda et al., 2013; Hjelmstad & Fields, 2003; Tejeda et al., 2015). Besides producing anti-glutamatergic effects through KOR agonism, dynorphin has also been shown to directly block glutamate NMDA receptors (Chen, Gu, & Huang, 1995). This effect seems to depend on extracellular glycine levels, which determine whether dynorphin will potentiate NMDA-receptor-mediated excitotoxicity or suppress NMDA receptor activity (Zhang et al., 1997). Dynorphin has been found to inhibit neuroplasticity in the hippocampus of animals (Xu et al., 2021; Terman, Wagner, & Chavkin, 1994), something that is also thought to play a role in schizophrenia (Stephan, Baldeweg, & Friston, 2006; Stephan, Friston, & Frith, 2009). This makes sense as NMDA receptors are the key mechanism for certain types of plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (Stephan, Baldeweg, & Friston, 2006).\n\nSo, as dopamine activity increases, dynorphin releases which reduces glutamate function through KOR and NMDA receptor inhibition. High activity of glutamate may also play a role in the dynorphin release, as it was mentioned above that the NMDA receptor seems to play a collaborator role along with dopamine D1 receptors in the release of the peptide.\n\nThe diathesis stress model proposes that stressful experiences produce a vulnerability to schizophrenic symptoms (Jones & Fernyhough, 2007). An older neural rendition of the diathesis stress model focused on cortisol and the stress response (Walker & Diforio, 1997). In this current paper, the focus is on dynorphin since it is part of the stress response and targets the same mechanisms that KOR agonistic hallucinogens stimulate to produce hallucinogenesis. This tweak to the model may better explain stress-related symptoms and schizophrenia.\n\nGeneral support of the diathesis stress model comes from research showing that those with schizophrenia have often had trauma (Larsson et al., 2013; Lommen & Restifo, 2009; Lysaker & LaRocco, 2008). As much as 82% of those diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders reported experiencing childhood trauma, particularly emotional neglect (Larsson et al., 2013). Other support for the model comes from the observation of stress-induced schizophrenia symptoms. One case study has explored 3 soldiers’ stress-induced hallucinations, which occurred without other psychopathology (Spivak et al., 1992). The soldiers’ symptoms were both acute and transient. A small study interviewing severe trauma survivors found that subjects experienced hallucinogenic effects from their stressful events, particularly those who experienced life-threatening situations and isolation (Siegel, 1984).\n\nThe diathesis stress model may be explained partly by the dynorphinergic effects of stress. In essence, some level of stress may produce hallucinogenic or psychotomimetic effects through dynorphin activity, possibly mimicking the effects of the KOR agonist hallucinogenic drugs like Salvia, Pentazocine, Ketazocine, and Ketamine. Repeated stress events may induce plasticity in the KOR system that eventually upregulates its’ function and sensitivity (Knoll et al., 2011), biasing one to find the dysphoric, stressful, and phobic elements of life as a protective mechanism against threatening environments. While it is only anecdotal, there have been reports that salvinorin A produces “reverse tolerance” in which taking the drug repeatedly produces an increasingly potentiated hallucinogenic response. Traumatic and stressful events may also be capable of a similar potentiation mechanism and this may underlie the diathesis stress model. We could term this phenomenon stress kindling. The term kindling usually refers to epileptogenesis that occurs from repeated stimulation of the brain or from repeated withdrawals from benzodiazepine sedatives. The idea is that smaller levels of stimulation produce a potentiated response later, in essence, reverse tolerance. This isn’t to say that stress always results in a kindling effect, but it may be a possible effect. Stress kindling may be a kind of aversion sensitization, similar to how there is reward sensitization that is often explored in addiction research.\n\nTo give an example of how stress sensitization may work, consider alcohol. Alcohol appears to induce fear and aversion sensitization via activation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray (Cabral et al., 2006). KOR agonism in this same brain region induces panic effects, while blocking KOR in this region has anti-panic effects (Maraschin et al., 2017). This may occur due to the stress of withdrawals, which may induce lasting sensitivity to KOR responses. Repeated alcohol use has been observed to induce plasticity in the KOR system, upregulating the dynorphin/KOR system (Sirohi, Bakalkin, & Walker, 2012), which supports this idea. In summary, repeated stress of alcohol withdrawal may sensitize aversion and fear responses via plasticity of the KOR system in the dorsal periaqueductal gray. This may generalize to many forms of stress, such as bullying, drugs, sleep loss, and traumatic events. Social stress and drug use are further explored in the following sections.\n\nImaginably, frequent or strongly negative experiences are expected to shape our judgment. If one has been in multiple car accidents, a fear of driving may emerge. Negative and positive life events may shape how negative or positive we expect life to be. Having strong or many negative events could lead one to anticipate more negative events, thus biasing one’s judgment towards expecting negative events. We anticipate a future that is derived from our understanding of our past and the world as we have experienced it. Events involving intentional harm towards an individual, such as parental betrayal and peer bullying may prime an individual to distrust people or worry about future harmful behaviors. Paranoia may often stem from the expectation or bias that other people intend to harm oneself. Those with schizophrenia may often have a genetic predisposition either to view experiences as negative or to have negative experiences. They may also be predisposed to discount positive experiences. Early life events may particularly influence the development of general distrust in people, since children have a smaller sample of normal human behavior. Trust-breaking events and betrayal may lead to further social avoidance and problems developing trusted bonds with peers. This may cause social conflict, isolation, and a failure to conform to social norms, beliefs, and other memetically-transferred behaviors, specifically because an individual would be less exposed to such memes if they are asocial.\n\nSocial stress is particularly relevant to both schizophrenia and the diathesis stress model and the effects of social stress may be partly mediated by endogenous opioid mechanisms.\n\nIndividuals with schizophrenia very often face social issues and this may produce stress responses that lead to KOR-mediated symptoms. The social issues in schizophrenia often precede the onset of schizophrenic symptoms (Ballon, Kaur, Marks, & Cadenhead, 2007). One study found that children of those with schizophrenia frequently had poor social adjustment, being unpopular with peers (Hans et al., 2000). Number of friends is negatively correlated to symptom severity in schizophrenia (Giacco et al., 2012). Experimental induction of loneliness seems to induce paranoia, while reducing loneliness decreases paranoia, effects that were moderated by proneness to psychosis (Lamster et al., 2017). Social isolation in childhood is linked to a potentiated KOR system in later life (Karkhanis, Rose, Weiner, & Jones, 2016). Social deprivation through solitary confinement also appears to produce nearly all symptoms of schizophrenia (Grassian & Friedman, 1986). This would suggest that negative social experience or social deprivation induces stress that may facilitate symptoms of schizophrenia and this may be in part due to dynorpinergic mechanisms.\n\nDue to noticing trends in the schizophrenic population, namely that those who generally face more prejudice experience schizophrenia more commonly, a social defeat hypothesis of schizophrenia was once proposed (Selten, Van Der Ven, Rutten, & Cantor-Graae, 2013). This is surprisingly corroborated by dynorphin research in animals. In the animal models of social defeat, dynorphin activity is increased and seems to determine whether the animal becomes defeated or expresses resilience (Bérubé, Laforest, Bhatnagar, & Drolet, 2013). Further studies indicated that dynorphins role during social defeat is primarily in acute social defeat stress responses (Donahue et al 2015). In humans, social status is negatively correlated with KOR density, specifically in areas that process reward and aversion (Matuskey et al., 2012). Opioid neurotransmission is thought to play a role in social reward processing in humans (Loseth et al 2014; Nummenmaa et al 2018; Manninin et al 2017; Trezza et al 2011). It is possible that social punishment or aversive experience is mediated by dynorphinergic opioid activity. This would fit with dynorphin’s more general role in stress and aversion. Social defeat (abuse, bullying, isolation, rejection) in humans may stimulate dynorphinergic aversive processing that may elevate the risk of developing dynorphinergic hallucinogenic and cognitive effects.\n\nParanoia and persecutory delusions may develop from conditioned salience of threatening stimuli due to repeated negative social experiences like being bullied (actual persecution).\n\nA more recent paper argued that the social defeat hypothesis may have problems with reverse causality (Selten, van Os, & Cantor‐Graae, 2016). Specifically, that schizophrenia may cause low social status. Rather than it being one hypothesis or the other, it may be both. Being born with genes associated to schizophrenia may both increase the risk for social defeat and social defeat may increase the risk of worsening symptoms. This seems clear when observing the benefits that socializing appears to have in those with schizophrenia. Those with schizophrenia may also have genes that make them more susceptible to the negative effects of social defeat and stress-induced symptoms like hallucinations. They may also have genes that cause them to face prejudice or defeat as well, making it more likely that the person will experience trauma or stress in their lifetime.\n\nChallenging of one’s beliefs can be stressful. This is especially true when the social cost for having a “bad” belief is high. We often tend to shame people for believing the wrong things or disagreeing with our beliefs. An implicit assumption that often accompanies this is that the wrong believer is stupid or insane. In essence, one is harmed for holding the belief. This often drives people to avoid believing ideas that go against their subculture, although in some cases a person can protect themselves from this pattern of dissent by trying harder to prove that they are not stupid or insane. One may then conclude that the opposition is the stupid or insane one.\n\nSchizophrenia and drug addiction very frequently coincide. This may be due to shared genetic liability between schizophrenia and drug use (Pasman et al., 2018) and it may also be due to drug use increasing the risk of schizophrenic symptoms (Howes et al., 2004). Dynorphin and the KOR system may help explain this connection. Dynorphin has been implicated in addiction, likely contributing to withdrawal symptoms and aversion that occurs when ceasing drug use (Bruijnzeel, 2009; Chavkin & Koob, 2016). Many commonly used drugs lead to enhanced dynorphin signaling via dopaminergic mechanisms. A rise in dynorphinergic activity has been observed as a consequence of the use of cocaine, alcohol, nicotine, methamphetamine, and morphine (Shippenberg, Zapata, & Chefer, 2007; Isola et al 2009; Hanson et al 1988; Nylander et al 1995). Dynorphin may even be implicated in food addiction (Karkhanis, Holleran, & Jones, 2017). As mentioned earlier, this dynorphin activity is likely induced by D1 receptor stimulation (Solís et al 2021; Hanson et al., 1995; Steiner & Gerfen, 1995). Normally, this dynorphin release may curb excess dopamine activity via dopamine release inhibition (Tejeda & Bonci, 2019), but when the dopaminergic drug wears off, dynorphin may remain elevated and produce dysphoric antidopaminergic symptoms such as anhedonia (Chavkin & Koob, 2016).\n\nThe use of stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine has been associated with psychotic symptoms (Curran, Byrappa, & McBride, 2004) and have contributed to ideas like the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia (Baumeister & Francis, 2002). As mentioned before, amphetamine users and schizophrenics have elevated D1-D2 heteromers located on dynorphin dense neurons (Perreault et al 2010), which may contribute to psychotic symptoms that emerge from dopamine activity via the release of dynorphin. The study by Perreault and colleagues also suggests that becoming addicted to dopaminergic drugs (at least amphetamine) may lead to physiological changes that resemble those observed in schizophrenic patients and that also line up with the same mechanisms stimulated by the hallucinogenic drug salvinorin A.\n\nIt is important to note that nicotine use among schizophrenics is exceedingly high, with some studies suggesting as much as 80% of those diagnosed with the condition use the drug, which has often been explained as self-medication (Chambers, 2009). The self-medication hypothesis may be partially true, but we cannot neglect the possibility that nicotine is contributing to the symptoms as well. Some researchers have actually written about this possibility, noting that schizophrenics do not self-medicate with antipsychotic drugs, but in fact they often will refuse their antipsychotic medication likely because of their demotivating and flattening effects (Quigley & MacCabe, 2019; Juckel, 2016).\n\nDrugs like nicotine may be ubiquitously desired by humans due to their rewarding and motivating effects. Those with schizophrenia may suffer from insufficiency of reward and motivation at baseline, possibly in relation to the decreased MOR receptor density and availability mentioned earlier, thus they may be driven to consume drugs that improve motivation and give a sense of reward more than those without schizophrenia. When these drugs are consumed, including nicotine, they may increase the risk for psychotic states via enhanced dynorphinergic signaling. In essence, those with schizophrenia may be more prone to seek out self-medication for the negative affective state but at the cost of risking more symptoms after tolerance and potentially psychosis eventually. These rewarding and motivating drugs may acutely resolve the diminished reward capacity in schizophrenia, but after tolerance sets in, they may experience elevated problems, particularly when the drug wears off and their reward capacity sinks below baseline, inducing a stronger bias towards threatening memories and stimuli. Hallucinations may stem from enhanced dynorphin signaling, potentially during the peak of dopamine spikes that induce dynorphin release via D1-NMDAr heteromers which is possibly facilitated by D2 receptor stimulation as well.\n\nInterestingly, opioid (MOR agonist) use was found to be much less in those diagnosed with schizophrenia than those with other diagnoses, while alcohol, cocaine, and cannabis use was more frequent in schizophrenia than those with other diagnoses (Chiappelli, Chen, Hackman, & Hong, 2018). Since MOR agonism has effects that are oppositional to KOR agonism (Pan, 1998), MOR agonists might treat schizophrenia to some degree or prevent diagnosis. Meanwhile, alcohol, cocaine, and cannabis might facilitate diagnosis by amplifying symptoms to the point of psychosis, leading to hospitalization and eventually diagnosis.\n\nSeizures were briefly mentioned in the context of kindling earlier and interestingly, seizures can invoke psychotic episodes. Some researchers have noted that dynorphin may help explain this tendency for seizures to bring on psychotic effects (Bortolato & Solbrig, 2007). Dynorphin seems to be a potent anticonvulsant and releases during seizures. This makes sense, as NMDA receptor hyperactivity and general glutamate hyperactivity is linked to seizure episodes (Bausch, He, & Dong, 2010) and dynorphin is capable of stopping both of these functions (Bortolato & Solbrig, 2007). The role of D1 receptors in producing a dynorphin response from stimulants also seemed to involve not only D1 but also NMDA receptor activation (Hanson et al., 1995), so this may partly be due to a role of dynorphin to stop excitotoxic and epileptic events that are related to NMDA receptor hyperactivity. Stimulants are also known to reduce the seizure threshold (Sheth & Samaniego, 2008; Hanson et al., 1999), possibly by stimulating mechanisms like NMDA receptors (often times indirectly).\n\nThe role of dynorphin targeting effects in psychedelic states, especially the kind induced by the so called classic psychedelics (serotonergic in nature; LSD, Psilocybin, MDMA), is likely to be controversial. It has been observed that LSD, both in acute and chronic dosing, suppressed the behavioral effects of KOR agonism (Sakloth et al., 2019). There are also mechanisms that may help in explaining this: LSD binds to 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors as a partial agonist.\n\n5HT1a serotonergic receptors may play a role in schizophrenic symptomology via dynorphin modulation and agonists may provide therapeutic value. 5HT1a receptor agonism is able to diminish the increase of dynorphin that occurs in response to L-Dopa, a dopaminergic substance (Tomiyama et al., 2005). In line with this, 5HT1a receptor agonism has been suggested to have antipsychotic effects, possibly by enhancing cognition and restoring neurogenesis (Schreiber & Newman-Tancredi, 2014). 5HT1a receptor agonism is thought to be antidepressant and induce activity of endogenous MOR agonists (Navinés et al., 2008), which might work to stabilize negative affect-mediated symptoms like memory biases and delusions.\n\n5HT1a receptors in the amygdala and neighboring regions may be implicated in schizophrenia. 5HT1a agonism reduces aversion processing in the periaqueductal gray (Nogueira & Graeff, 1995). This brain region works with the amygdala in fear learning (Keifer Jr, Hurt, Ressler, & Marvar, 2015), something that dynorphin plays a role in (Knoll et al., 2011). From a small study, individuals with schizophrenia appear to have a hyperactivity of the amygdala (Pinkham et al., 2015). In tasks that measure fearful face processing, schizophrenics had overactivation of the amygdala even when presented neutral (non-fearful) stimuli (Hall et al., 2008; Dugré, Bitar, Dumais, & Potvin, 2019), suggesting a hyperactive fear-processing system. Schizophrenics also seem to have decreased 5HT1a receptor binding in the amygdala (Yasuno et al., 2014), which tsuggest unchecked fear/aversion processing and learning. This could help explain symptoms like paranoia. This decrease in 5HT1a receptor binding may allow dynorphin to accumulate, producing dysphoric, dissociative, and hallucinogenic effects that resemble the dynorphin-mimetic drug salvia.\n\nThe reduction of 5HT1a binding in schizophrenia may help explain the impairment of neuroplasticity (Balu & Coyle, 2011), as well as aberrant neurogenesis thought to be implicated in schizophrenia (Weissleder, North, & Weickert, 2019), since 5HT1a receptor agonism appears to induce neurogenesis (Borroto-Escuela et al., 2015; Klempin et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2016; Schreiber & Newman-Tancredi, 2014) and neuroplasticity (Albert & Vahid-Ansari, 2019; Aguiar et al., 2020). Dynorphin is also known to have antiplastic effects (Polter et al., 2014; Huge et al., 2009; Terman, Wagner, & Chavkin, 1994), so the inhibition of dynorphin by 5HT1a receptor agonism may help restore the plasticity that is observed to be diminished in schizophrenics as well. The schizophrenic’s loss of 5HT1a receptor function may allow an antiplastic state to emerge via disinhibited dynorphin activity and 5HT1a receptor agonism may help to inhibit antiplastic mechanisms and improve function in schizophrenia.\n\nSome important notes: those with schizophrenia may have increased binding of 5HT1a receptors in the prefrontal cortex (Burnet, Eastwood, & Harrison, 1997).\n\nDifferences in 5HT2a receptor density and binding may exist in schizophrenia and have implications for learning and memory. A meta-analysis and systematic review from 2014 found reduced binding of the 5HT2a receptor in post-mortem studies on schizophrenic patients and in molecular imaging studies in unmedicated schizophrenics, although the studies analyzed in this paper often had mixed and contradicting results (Selvaraj, Arnone, Cappai, & Howes, 2014). Reduced 5HT2a receptor binding has been associated with reduced cognitive ability in humans (Hasselbalch et al., 2008), which might help in explaining reduced cognitive ability in schizophrenic patients. Schizophrenics also appear to show reduced responsiveness to DMT and LSD in very old studies (Cholden, Kurland, & Savage, 1955; Böszörményi, 1958), supporting the observation of reduced binding. The date these studies were published aligns very closely to the earlier uses of the first antipsychotic drugs and it is unclear whether these patients were medicated. Since the results of the studies seem counterintuitive, one would expect that the authors considered the possibility that antipsychotic medication could also be antipsychedelic as well. Since there is no mention of this as an explanation for their observations, this could suggest the patients were not medicated with antipsychotics.\n\nThis receptor has been argued to be the ‘main’ mechanism of the serotonergic psychedelic drugs and may modulate KOR activity. It is thought that the receptor produces its’ psychedelic effects by suppressing glutamate mGlur2 receptor binding which results in a disinhibition of glutamate release, and thus a subsequent increase in glutamate activity (Delille et al., 2012). Besides LSD suppressing the behavioral effects of KOR agonism, there is evidence that 5HT2a receptors alter the effects of the KOR/dynorphin system. Blockade of 5HT2a receptors induces potentiation of the KOR activity of morphine (Peiró et al., 2011). Presumably, activity at 5HT2a receptors may then attenuate KOR activity. The 5HT2a receptors have also been implicated in anti-aversive effects in the periaqueductal gray (Nogueira & Graeff, 1995). This might be due to an interaction between 5HT2a receptors and the dynorphin/KOR system.\n\nThere are a few speculations that could be made as to the possible anti-dynorphin mechanisms of 5HT2a receptors. One is the induced release of acetylcholine in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (Nair & Gudelsky, 2004), which may promote agonism of the nAch alpha7 receptor, which suppresses dynorphin release from microglia (Ji et al., 2019). Interestingly, there is some (weak) evidence that mGlur2 stimulation facilitates KOR activity (Liu et al., 2017), though this seems still unclear as the researchers were studying diestrus. If this is true, then inhibition of mGlur2 via 5HT2a receptor agonism may suppress the dynorphin activity mediated by mGlur2 agonism. These mechanisms may be a good place to look 5HT2a receptor and dynorphin system interactions in future research.\n\nIt is possible that 5HT2a receptors are antidynorphinergic similarly to 5HT1a receptors, although it is less clear in this case. There is a section further down titled “Do Psychedelics Promote KOR Activity?” that explores the opposing argument, that 5HT2a receptor agonism may actually enhance KOR activity.\n\nSince dynorphin may play a role in learning and memory impairments and since schizophrenia involves learning and memory impairments, it is worth exploring the role of 5HT2a receptors in learning and memory.\n\nThere is evidence that drugs targeting 5HT2a receptors enhance learning and memory (Zhang & Stackman, 2015; Morales-Garcia et al., 2020; Barre et al., 2016), though there is also evidence that psilocin can impair learning and even acquisition at higher doses (Rambousek, Palenicek, Vales, & Stuchlik 2014). 5HT2a receptor agonists have been observed to enhance reversal learning in both animals (King, Martin, & Melville, 1974) and possibly humans (preprint experimental study) (Kanen et al., 2021). The 5HT2a receptor has been purported to play a role in plasticity and neurogenesis (enhanced in neocortex, inhibited in hippocampus) (Barre et al., 2016; Vaidya, Marek, Aghajanian, & Duman, 1997). These patterns of learning and plasticity are significant as schizophrenics show impairment in these areas, which could be explained by their reduced receptor counts. Unmedicated schizophrenics have impaired reversal learning (Schlagenhauf et al., 2014). These individuals also show impaired learning and memory (Diwadkar et al., 2008), and seem to have seem to have impaired plasticity and neurogenesis (Hall et al., 2015; Daskalakis, Christensen, Fitzgerald, & Chen, 2008; Stephan, Baldeweg, & Friston, 2006; Stephan, Friston, & Frith, 2009; Reif, Schmitt, Fritzen, & Lesch, 2007).\n\nAn important note: 5HT2 receptor agonism seems to oppose neurogenesis induced by 5HT1a receptor agonism (Klempin et al., 2010). This might suggest that the neurogenesis enhancing effects of psychedelics are related to 5HT1a receptor agonism rather than 5HT2 receptor agonism. Interestingly, there is also evidence that 5HT1a receptor antagonism potentiates the subjective psychedelic effects of DMT, a 5HT2a agonizing psychedelic (Barker, 2018). The neurogenesis topic is likely more complicated than it seems, so 5HT2a receptors may still play an important role. The study finding that 5HT2 receptor agonism decreases neurogenesis induced by 5HT1a receptors also found that 5HT2 receptor agonism promotes cell differentiation (Klempin et al., 2010), so it may play an important and useful role here as well. This study also didn’t distinguish 5HT2a and 5HT2c unfortunately.\n\nIt is even possible that some of the popularly known psychedelic effects are due to KOR-mediated effects at higher doses. While the low doses of psychedelics seem to produce an enhanced connection to reality, the senses, and the mind, on high doses of psychedelics people begin to dissociate away from reality (consider the DMT breakthrough, which appears very dissociative). The KOR agonists seem to generally disconnect one from reality dose-dependently, without the enhancement phase. Psychedelics may emulate the dynamics of seizures, where first an increase of sensation or some aspect of experience occurs, then a depression and disconnection occurs afterward as dynorphins flood into the brain to compensate for excess glutamate or dopamine activity. Besides this hypothesis, there are also mechanisms explored below that could underlie distinct psychotic or non-psychotic states\n\nAnother possibility is that 5HT2a receptor agonism actually promotes either KOR or dissociative (NMDAr antagonist) mechanisms under certain conditions. As mentioned previously, 5HT1a antagonists enhance the subjective effects of DMT. DMT itself is a 5HT1a, 5HT2a, and 5HT2c receptor agonist (Barker 2018). Since the agonism of the 5HT1a receptor was found to suppress increases of dynorphin due to dopamine D1 receptor stimulation (Tomiyama et al 2005) and antagonists of 5HT1a receptors potentiate the subjective effects of DMT in humans (Barker 2018), it is possible that blocking 5HT1a receptors is facilitating dynorphin release via another mechanism like 5HT2a. 5HT1a receptor antagonists also facilitate NMDA receptor inhibition via serotonin agonism at 5HT2a receptors, mimicking the 5HT2a receptor partial agonists studied (Arvonav et al 1999). These together suggest two possibly distinct (although they could be convergent) mechanisms underlying the “intensity” of subjective effects on psychedelics.\n\nIt is possible that 5HT2a receptors promote dynorphin release by enhancing D2 receptors. The increase of dynorphin via D1 receptor stimulation seems to rely on the presence of the D2 receptor and fails in D2 receptor knockout animals (Solís et al 2021). As mentioned before, D1-D2 heteromers colocalize on dynorphin neurons in a high affinity state in amphetamine abusers and schizophrenics (Perreault et al 2010), suggesting the cluster of these mechanisms may drive psychotic-like effects perhaps via potentiated KOR activity and NMDA receptor inhibition. 5HT2a receptors potentiate D2 receptor activity (Borroto-Escuela et al 2014), which might actually increase dynorphin release. This may suggest that 5HT2a receptor agonism is suppressing NMDA receptor activity by enhancing dynorphin release, although this is unclear still and would need to be explored in further research. From this research it does seem that 5HT2a receptor agonism has differential effects on NMDA receptors depending on 5HT1a receptor activity.\n\nClearly there are aversive and even frightening effects that can occur with the use of psychedelic drugs. This might be explainable partly by 5HT2c receptor binding. Dynorphin mRNA colocalizes strongly in 5HT2c dense neurons, while it was found lowest in the 5HT2a receptor dense neurons (Ward & Dorsa, 1996). 5HT2c agonism seems to facilitate CRF activity (Heisler et al., 2007) and CRF appears to induce dynorphin activity as part of the stress-response cascade (Bruchas, Land, & Chavkin, 2010). Both CRF and dynorphin are cofactors for the aversive effects of stress (Land et al 2008). This makes some sense, considering that 5HT2c receptors have been implicated in anxious responses to serotonergic drugs (Burghardt et al., 2007). Increasing the density of 5HT2c receptors in animals produces sensitivity to developing PTSD-like behavior (Règue et al., 2019). Though the connection between 5HT2c receptors and anxious reactions seems complicated, as it sometimes seems to produce an anti-phobic reaction (Jenck et al., 1998). It seems to depend on whether the anxious stimuli is a conditioned one or an unconditioned one. The conditioned anxious stimuli are enhanced while the unconditioned anxious stimuli are diminished (Mora, Netto, & Graeff, 1997). Though, it isn’t clear if that is really the case.\n\nImportant note: 5HT1a, 5HT2a, and 5HT2c all appear to increase CRF synthesis (Jørgensen et al., 2002), which might mean that 5HT2c isn’t especially CRF facilitating over the other serotonin receptor subtypes. Although the other receptor subtypes seem to be anti-aversive and the 5HT1a receptor seems to suppress dynorphin activity, so they may not all induce anxiety. 5HT2a receptors do seem to produce anxiety-like responses in animals (Weisstaub et al., 2006). Another study found that blockade of 5HT2a receptors increases CRF and the authors suggested that 5HT2a receptors may downregulate CRF (Nonogaki, Nozue, & Oka, 2006). It could be that the 5HT2a receptor’s effect is dependent on the state of 5HT1a receptors similarly to the case of 5HT2a receptor’s effects on NMDA receptors described earlier.\n\nThe cannabinoid known as THC is used by as much as 25% of schizophrenics have been diagnosed with cannabis use disorder at some point (Koskinen et al., 2010). THC appears to produce more classically schizophrenic effects, such as hearing voices, conspiratorial thinking, paranoia, and dissociation (PsychonautWiki). Interestingly, THC and other CB1 agonists actually reduce the commonly studied head twitch response that animals have when ingesting psychedelics (Darmani, 2001). Darmani also notes that CB1 antagonists induce a head twitch response, even without application of a psychedelic drug. This head twitch response has been associated especially to 5HT2a receptors, though 5HT2c may have some modulatory role (Canal & Morgan, 2012). This is significant because it suggests that THC and CB1 agonism generally may have anti-5HT2a effects. There is a study claiming that chronic use of THC enhances hallucinogenic signaling of 5HT2a receptors through heteromeric processes between CB1 and 5HT2a receptors (Ibarra-Lecue et al., 2018). This may not apply to acute use of THC. Usually, chronic use of LSD or similar psychedelics does not produce an enhancement of 5HT2a receptor mediated effects, they actually downregulate the receptors (Buchborn, Schröder, Höllt, & Grecksch, 2014). So THC may produce such an upregulation by inhibiting 5HT2a receptor activity through some mechanism, likely suppression via heteromeric processes, since 5HT2a receptors and CB1 receptors form heteromers. One complication of this idea is that users of psychedelics report a great potentiation when adding THC to a psychedelic trip. This potentiation may stem from other mechanisms besides facilitation of 5HT2a receptor agonism, such as alterations to GABA or glutamate release.\n\nTHC is also observed to induce dynorphin A (Mason Jr, Lowe, & Welch, 1999) and this induction of dynorphin seems to be necessary for THC-induced aversion, as mice lacking dynorphin do not experience THC induced aversion like normal animals (Zimmer et al., 2001). The euphoric effects of THC seem to be mediated by MOR agonism while the dysphoric effects seem to be mediated by KOR agonism (Ghozland et al., 2002). THC’s induction of paranoia seems to be strongly tied to negative affect induction (Freeman et al., 2015), which seems to be mediated by dynorphin release. THC may produce its’ hallucinogenic effects through indirect KOR stimulation rather than 5HT2a receptors. The reduction of 5HT2a receptor mediated effects by THC may potentiate KOR activity like what is observed in 5HT2a receptor antagonists. This may also mimic the reduced 5HT2a receptor binding observed in schizophrenics.\n\nThis project will continue to expand from here.\n\nIf you found this enjoyable, consider joining the Patreon!

    "description": "My first time visiting New Zealand was a solo trip. I made mistakes booking the TranzAlpine train and planning activities that cost me time and money.",
    "fullText": "Even after traveling the world solo for 10 years, I still make mistakes when visiting new destinations.\n\nBefore my first trip to New Zealand, I felt prepared: I had years of travel experience, solid research skills, an innate understanding of Polynesian culture from my roots in Hawaii, and even a local contact in Auckland.\n\nBut from common slip-ups like miscalculating timing to bigger missteps like booking non-refundable tickets for weather-dependent activities, I managed to get plenty wrong along the way.\n\nHere are some of the biggest mistakes I made during my six weeks in New Zealand — and how you can hopefully avoid them.\n\nI packed my itinerary with excursions, but didn't plan all of them well.\n\nFor example, my day trip to Waiheke Island was cut short because I arrived too late, not realizing that \"island time\" meant shops and wineries closed around 5 p.m.— even earlier than I'm used to back home on Maui.\n\nI decided to linger in the town of Rotorua since it had so many unique activities nearby: a Maori cultural experience, New Zealand's original geothermal spa, a redwood tree walk, and the Hobbiton movie set tour.\n\nWhen I stepped off the bus, I expected to see a bustling tourist spot. Instead, I thought Rotorua felt like a ghost town — one with a pungent sulphur smell that only worsened at night.\n\nWhen I got to my next destination, Taupo, I immediately wished I'd booked more time there. It had the same lakeside charm but with more life, fresher-smelling air, and more affordable food — including tons of options for my keto diet.\n\nNew Zealand is renowned for its stunning scenery, but some bus routes have better views on a particular side.\n\nBefore each ride, I wish I'd looked into which side offered the best vantage points instead of realizing halfway through that I was on the wrong one.\n\nI was eager to experience the TranzAlpine journey through New Zealand's Southern Alps — it's celebrated as one of the most scenic train rides in the world.\n\nThe views were wonderful, but I'm not sure doing a round trip on the train was the best, most interesting use of my time.\n\nLater, I realized it would have made more sense to get off in Greymouth and continue by bus down the West Coast to Queenstown.\n\nThat alternative route would have taken more time and required an overnight stay, but it would have given me a richer, more novel experience than simply looping back to Christchurch.\n\nI planned stays in Lake Tekapo and Te Anau hoping to glimpse the aurora australis, or southern lights, but canceled both due to cloudy forecasts that would have made aurora chasing impossible.\n\nAfter rerouting, I also canceled a hot pool and stargazing experience I'd confidently booked as non-refundable, which meant losing that money.\n\nTo fill this gap in my itinerary, I stayed longer in Queenstown, where I never expected to see the aurora because of light pollution. Ironically, that's exactly where I captured photos of the cosmic phenomenon.\n\nAll that said, next time I travel, I probably wouldn't book non-refundable excursions that are so contingent on weather.\n\nWhether it was because of weather, logistical mishaps, or my health, I ended up rescheduling and canceling a lot of excursions throughout my journey.\n\nThis included stays in several cities, a trip on the Coastal Pacific train route, a whale-watching flight, and more.\n\nIf I'd had more days in New Zealand, maybe things would've been different. However, I could've benefitted from narrowing down my plans off the bat to focus on what I truly wanted while creating more time for spontaneity.\n\nThat said, I'm grateful I gave myself the flexibility to back out of plans that no longer aligned without guilt or regret.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI is building a team to make sure bad ads don't mess up its highly anticipated introduction of advertising in ChatGPT.\n\nAn OpenAI job listing for a software engineer posted late January revealed the company is building an \"ads integrity\" team.\n\nThe ad describes the job as a high-impact role on \"a 0 → 1 team,\" a commonly used term in Silicon Valley and elsewhere to describe a team being built from scratch.\n\nThis person will be responsible for designing systems that enable OpenAI's ad business to grow without compromising user trust and safety, per the listing.\n\nIt's common for Big Tech companies with large ad businesses to create teams to combat ad fraud and address other issues, such as brand safety. OpenAI, which confirmed last month that it would soon begin testing ChatGPT ads, is building this part of its ad function early.\n\nThe job listing also says that its new ad integrity hire will work on developing \"know your customer\" (KYC) systems to verify advertisers' identities and assess their risk. KYC, a term most commonly used in the finance industry, is an important but labor-intensive discipline for cracking down on scam ads and other harmful content created by criminals and other bad actors. It's a particularly pressing issue for Big Tech companies with self-service ad platforms, as a recent Reuters investigation into Meta highlighted. Meta said in early December it had removed \"more than 134 million scam ads\" in 2025.\n\nAriella Garcia, chief operating officer of the Check My Ads Institute, said it would be interesting to see how substantive OpenAI's investment in its ads integrity team would be beyond the initial launch.\n\n\"KYC on advertisers is certainly a good foundation, but the materiality of the risk of a large volume of scam ads in the early days is far lower,\" Garcia said.\n\nThe job listing says that the new ads integrity hire will play a role in determining where and how ads are shown in ChatGPT. OpenAI will need to keep user trust in its organic answers as it ramps up its advertising business. At the same time, advertisers have said that OpenAI will need to prove that ads within AI answers can drive results for their businesses if it has any hope of scaling.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the company will run a small test of ads on ChatGPT's free version and its Go tier in the US, which users should begin seeing in the coming weeks.\n\nThe spokesperson said OpenAI is asking for a minimum spend of $200,000 on ChatGPT ads to participate in the program, confirming prior Adweek reporting. OpenAI will track clicks and impressions, but will likely explore further measurement options as its advertising experiments progress, the spokesperson said.\n\nOpenAI declined to comment on the ads integrity job ad.",

In December, he told a podcast host that he stayed on the island for one night on a trip connected to fundraising activities.\n\n\"Note to self: Google before going,\" Hoffman said on the podcast.\n\nHoffman's appearance in the Epstein files has helped reignite the billionaire's feud with Elon Musk.",

    "description": "Billionaire investor Ray Dalio said he believes gold is still a safe-haven asset, given its large presence in central bank reserves.",
    "fullText": "For Ray Dalio, gold hasn't lost its shine.\n\nWhile many metal investors are likely still shaken by gold's 12% plunge last Friday, the famed hedge fund founder said he wasn't fazed by gold's big drop. That's because bullion is still a safe-haven asset, Dalio said, making the case for why gold should still be a part of investors' portfolios at the World Governments Summit on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking at the conference in Dubai, the Bridgewater founder noted that gold was still held in large amounts by the world's central banks. Bullion surpassed the euro as the second-largest reserve asset last year.\n\n\"I think if people were to make — those who are running policies and so on — were to say, they would say gold is the safest money in this kind of environment,\" Dalio said.\n\nThe safety of the metal also doesn't \"change by the day,\" Dalio added, referring to the gold's long-standing status as a hedge against inflation and an alternative to fiat money.\n\nWhile gold is still down 7% from its all-time high, its price is up 71% in the last year.\n\n\"I think people make the mistake of thinking, 'Is it going to go up or down, and should I buy it?'\" Dalio said, suggesting that a better question would be how much an investor should allocate to gold as a percentage of their total portfolio.\n\nGold sold off hard alongside other metals last week as investors took in President Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh for Fed Chair. Investors quickly repriced their outlook for rates and the dollar, prompting a rapid unwind of their metal positions.\n\nPart of gold's allure in the past year has also been fueled by perceived economic risks, such as the fear that debt levels could rise to unsustainable levels or that the US dollar could weaken alongside other fiat currencies.\n\nDalio, who has regularly warned markets of such risks, said he still believes the US is \"on the brink\" of a capital war, a situation where geopolitical tensions make global investors hesitant to lend money to the US by buying its bonds.\n\n\"Gold is a diversifier. In other words, when the bad times come along, it does uniquely well,\" Dalio said. \"I'd say the most important thing is to have a well-diversified portfolio.\"\n\nDalio is known for being a proponent of gold investing. In the past, he's recommended that investors allocate 15% of their portfolios to gold and bitcoin, pointing to concerns about currency debasement.",

    "description": "Business Insider was on the scene at a WSJ conference that brought together leaders from Blackstone, Lazard, and Citi.",
    "fullText": "Most people flock to Palm Beach for sunshine and an escape. But on Tuesday, Wall Street's elite got 40-degree weather and nonstop talk about one company: Anthropic.\n\nAs the morning session of The Wall Street Journal's Invest Live event kicked off, the AI startup announced its new \"Claude Cowork\" legal plugins, a tool designed to automate contract triage and NDAs. The news unnerved investors, dragging down indexes like the Nasdaq and tech stocks from Palantir to Oracle. Thomson Reuters had dipped 20% by mid-afternoon, experiencing one of its worst single-day drops as investors panicked that software investments deemed cutting-edge a few years ago could soon be rendered passé.\n\nPeter Orszag, CEO of the investment bank Lazard and a former Obama administration official, offered a sobering macro view. \"The US economy and the equity market at this point are highly levered bets with regard to AI taking off,\" he said. \"What I think you're seeing is when people get nervous about whether that'll happen.\"\n\nThat said, he didn't contest the tech's future — just that some key players might not be around in a few years. \"You can bet on the technology paying off,\" he said, \"but that the firms making the investments today are not necessarily the ones that benefit.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Jon Gray, president of Blackstone, which manages over $1.3 trillion, emphasized the lucrative effects of the mini-economy that's sprung up to meet the physical and infrastructural demands of the artificial intelligence boom.\n\n\"To us, you don't necessarily have to know who the winners and losers are going to be,\" Gray said. \"You know that the data centers, the autonomous vehicles, the robots, they're all going to plug into the wall, and there's going to be a lot of need for digital infrastructure.\"\n\nSeveral attendees had recently returned from last month's World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps and were likely hoping to leave the chill behind. But alas, one woman I spotted was bundled up in fur, and I personally had to fish out a 10-year-old coat from the back of my closet to make it from my Uber to the event's entrance.\n\nAt lunchtime, we decamped to the courtyard for a salmon salad and sweet iced tea, and the conversation drifted between the rise of South Florida in the post-pandemic era and the outlook for financial sponsors' spending this year. But as we shuffled back to our seats for the afternoon's lineup of speakers, the chill returned as we caught up with the market's increasingly dour reaction to Anthropic's news.\n\nSteven Tananbaum, founder of GoldenTree Asset Management, saw an opportunity in the rout. For a credit specialist, \"indiscriminate selling\" is a chance to find value where others see only collapse. \"The idea that all software is the same is what's exciting,\" he said about the broad sell-off. \"There's just indiscriminate selling regardless of what the prospects are.\"\n\nThe day ended with a reminder that while the markets might be sweating over incremental news, the C-suite is playing a longer game.\n\nAs it happened, I got to ask the final question of the day's concluding speaker, Mark Mason, Citi's chief financial officer, who's stepping down from his role this spring. He pointed to the cost-saving potential of AI, which would free up more money for Citi to devote to advancing CEO Jane Fraser's mission: putting the bank's multiyear overhaul behind it. The bank is applying the tech to its most critical processes, he said.\n\n\"What will it take to actually drive greater efficiency in that process? And I think that's a much better approach than the way others have thought about use cases,\" he added, referring to other banks.\n\nEarlier in the day, Hemant Taneja, the CEO of General Catalyst, a major VC backer of Anthropic, conceded that the economy will shed jobs due to AI, urging attendees to focus on education to retrain workers. \"Never ever was there a case that every skill in any job can be better done by AI and robotics,\" he said, \"which is, I think, where we are headed in the next, not five, but 20 to 30 years.\"\n\nStill, some speakers, like billionaire activist Nelson Peltz, brought some levity to the proceedings. Peltz — famous for his high-profile corporate showdowns with executives like Disney's Bob Iger — expressed enthusiasm for technology that could pump out faster, simpler answers to his legal questions.\n\n\"Not being a lawyer, I'm sort of happy,\" he said, as anxious laughter coursed through the room.",

    "description": "Over 1,000 people have donated to a GoFundMe for laid-off Washington Post staffers, including several notable names.",
    "fullText": "Money is pouring in for workers impacted by Wednesday's layoffs at The Washington Post.\n\nAs of writing, over 1,000 supporters had donated more than $130,000 combined to a GoFundMe page set up for let-go journalists.\n\nThe fundraising push, launched just a few hours after company executives began cutting workers, was set up by Post reporter Rachel Siegel and the newsroom's union. Its top donor, tech journalist and former Post employee Kara Swisher, gave $10,000.\n\nSwisher, who recently made a push to buy the Post from its billionaire owner, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, wrote on Threads that she had the means to \"donate a decent chunk of dough to these hardworking employees,\" and urged others to follow.\n\nOther top donors appeared to be former Washington Post staffers, such as Eugene Robinson and Fred Barbash.\n\nThe Post's haul, and the speed at which it drew in six figures, make it an outlier among media layoff fundraisers. Laid-off staffers at Vox Media pulled in about $7,000 in their January GoFundMe, while Teen Vogue got about $41,000 after November layoffs.\n\n\"Post Guild members have come together to support their colleagues with this GoFundMe,\" said a spokesperson for the Washington Baltimore News Guild, which represents the paper's union. The spokesperson blamed \"inexcusable business decisions of top Post leadership\" for the cuts.\n\n\"The Washington Post is taking a number of difficult but decisive actions today for our future, in what amounts to a significant restructuring across the company,\" a Post spokesperson said in a statement on the layoffs. \"These steps are designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.\"\n\nAs donations flooded in, others in the media industry offered career support. Executives at the platforms Substack and Beehiiv posted on X (formerly Twitter) that they're offering fee waivers and training for any Post reporters who took the leap to go independent, for example.\n\nThe Post's layoffs, which its newsroom union said impacted hundreds of workers, were designed to trim costs and refocus its efforts around a smaller set of coverage areas, executive editor Matt Murray told employees over Zoom on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe company is shutting down its podcast, \"Post Reports,\" and letting go of journalists focused on sports, books, and foreign affairs. It's restructuring its D.C. metro coverage, and investing in areas like politics and national security that \"demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact,\" Murray wrote in a memo to staff, viewed by Business Insider.\n\n\"Today is about positioning ourselves to become more essential to people's lives in what has become a more crowded, competitive, and complicated media landscape,\" Murray told staffers during the call. \"For too long, we've operated with a structure that's too rooted in the days when we were a quasi-monopoly local newspaper.\"",

    "description": "Tech stocks are trading lower as investors assess whether AI could upend current software leadership. Analysts say the market reaction is overblown.",
    "fullText": "Bank of America analysts say Wall Street is blowing the latest AI fears out of proportion as the tech sell-off drags on.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down about 2% on Wednesday, extending losses from Tuesday's session. Analysts say recent losses, fueled by AI disruption worries and some poorly received earnings, are overblown and don't justify the broad sell-off.\n\nThe sell-off kicked off in the software sector after AI start-up Anthropic introduced a new plugin for its Claude Cowork AI agent. The new tool is said to be more automatic in completing clerical tasks than conversational chatbots, fueling worries that AI will replace software and dethrone existing market leaders.\n\nWilliam Blair analysts say these fears are overstated, calling the new AI tool the latest \"boogeyman in software.\"\n\nThe analysts say that while there will be some AI disruption in store for software makers, it will be how companies adapt to the AI era that sets apart the winners and losers.\n\n\"There will naturally be some disruption, especially for point solutions, nice to have tools (as opposed to mission-critical systems), and vendors that are not able or willing to adapt to the new tech paradigm,\" they wrote, noting, \"This does not justify the broad-based indiscriminate selling we are seeing across the sector.\"\n\nBank of America compared the recent tech sector nosedive to the January 2025 sell-off fueled by Chinese AI DeepSeek, which spurred major short-term losses for Wall Street and erased $1 trillion in market capitalization in one day.\n\n\"In several respects, the current indiscriminate selloff resembles the DeepSeek-driven decline of Jan'25, which ultimately proved unfounded and was followed by higher capex and accelerating AI token growth.\"\n\nDespite investors' panic that DeepSeek marked a turning point in the AI arms race, major indexes not only recovered but ended 2025 up by double digits, fueled in large part by AI momentum. The analysts also noted that global cloud capital spending grew 69% in 2025 from the year-ago period, above previous forecasts in spite of worries.\n\nSoftware's dramatic downturn reflects negative investor sentiment around the sector, not a change in fundamentals.\n\nIn fact, Bank of America underlined the incongruence of Wall Street's thinking, which is driving \"inconsistency in AI stock moves.\"\n\n\"Price action implies AI capex is deteriorating to the point of weak ROI and unsustainable growth, while simultaneously suggesting AI adoption will be so pervasive and productivity-enhancing that long-standing software workflows and business models become obsolete. Both outcomes cannot occur at once.\"\n\nWilliam Blair analysts echoed a view calling software weakness a \"sentiment problem.\" They highlighted the post-earnings price declines in Microsoft and ServiceNow stocks, despite the companies' fundamentally strong prints. AMD saw a similar drop after its stock fell over 17% on Wednesday, despite earnings beating on the top and bottom lines.",

    "fullText": "Nike is facing a federal probe over allegations that its DEI targets led to discrimination against white workers.\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Wednesday that it has asked a federal judge to require Nike to provide information for its investigation into alleged racial discrimination. The sportswear giant is accused of intentional systemic discrimination against white employees, with some requests for information dating back to 2018.\n\nA Nike spokesperson called the filing a \"surprising and unusual escalation.\"\n\n\"We have shared thousands of pages of information and detailed written responses to the EEOC's inquiry and are in the process of providing additional information,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThey added: \"We are committed to fair and lawful employment practices and follow all applicable laws, including those that prohibit discrimination.\"\n\nThe subpoena enforcement action stems from an investigation charge filed by EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas in May 2024. Lucas alleged that Nike violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 through unlawful employment practices, including layoff selection, training and development opportunities, hiring, and promotion, all of which were based, in whole or in part, on race.\n\nThe EEOC wants Nike to turn over its criteria for choosing employees for layoffs, and how it tracks and uses worker race and ethnicity data, including as a factor for setting executive pay, the agency said. It also wants more information about 16 programs accused of providing mentoring, leadership, or career development opportunities based on race.\n\nIn 2021, Nike announced a five-year road map for creating more diversity and inclusion in its workforce, which included tying executive pay to the company's progress in its DEI efforts. One of the objectives was to target 35% representation of racial and ethnic minorities in its US workforce by 2025. Nike employed 76,600 people as of May 2025.\n\nThe probe marks the latest move by President Donald Trump and his appointees to end DEI programs in the workforce. Last year, Trump signed an executive order to restrict DEI in the federal government and instructed agencies to probe companies over their DEI objectives.\n\n\"Thanks to President Trump's commitment to enforcing our nation's civil rights laws, the EEOC has renewed its focus on evenhanded enforcement of Title VII,\" Lucas said in Wednesday's press release.",

    "fullText": "An award-winning coder has been quietly working for Thinking Machines Lab, the AI startup founded by former OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati.\n\nNeal Wu is a three-time gold medal winner at an international programming Olympiad and a founding member of the AI coding startup Cognition, which is valued at $10 billion. He is the elder brother of Scott Wu, the CEO and cofounder of Cognition.\n\nThe move shows that Thinking Machines Lab, valued at over $10 billion, continues to attract star talent, even as it has been the target of aggressive AI poaching campaigns from rivals like Meta.\n\nThinking Machines Lab declined to comment. Wu and Cognition did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBusiness Insider reviewed internal correspondence describing Wu as a team member of Thinking Machines Lab, which helps developers train and customize AI models. Neither Wu nor the secretive startup, which is based in San Francisco, has publicly announced his role.\n\nIt's not clear what Wu's exact position is. His LinkedIn profile says he has been working as a cofounder and advisor on \"something new\" since January 2025, around the time Murati's startup emerged from stealth.\n\nThinking Machines Lab has seen top staff leave in the last few months.\n\nMeta's aggressive poaching effort last year saw the tech giant dangling huge offers worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Meta eventually hired cofounder Andrew Tulloch after offering him a compensation package of up to $1.5 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIn January, its CTO, Barret Zoph, along with two other founding members, abruptly jumped ship back to OpenAI.\n\nThinking Machines Lab has a strong staff pedigree, with employees coming from AI labs like OpenAI and Meta. It was valued at more than $10 billion and raised a $2 billion seed round before launching a product.\n\nThe startup was seeking funds at a $50 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported in November.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Hundreds of journalists at The Washington Post received dreaded emails in their inboxes on Wednesday morning informing them they'd been laid off. The emails also addressed another key question: how much severance the Post was offering.\n\nThe newspaper, owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, made sweeping cuts across the newsroom as part of a restructuring of its business. Journalists who cover sports, foreign affairs, books, or do audio reporting were particularly impacted. The company said in a statement that the changes were designed to \"strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart.\"\n\nAs some workers were shown the door, human resources sent over severance packages tied to how long they'd worked at the company. Business Insider viewed a copy of the offer terms.\n\nPost journalists aren't required to take the severance offer, and they could lose the package if they don't act professionally during the process, according to a memo sent to staff by human resources and viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe company also must negotiate separation terms with the newsroom's union, the Washington Post Guild. That means \"the exact terms of the separation program\" are not yet final, the memo said.\n\nThe Washington Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The newspaper's union also did not immediately respond.\n\nIn the memo, the Post's HR point person told affected staff that the decision to cut their jobs was in \"no way a reflection of your worth or dedication, but a necessary step in the evolution of our business.\"\n\nOutside of severance, Post workers may also receive financial support from a new GoFundMe page launched on Wednesday that has raised over $100,000, including $10,000 from Kara Swisher.",

    "description": "The first phase of the Pentagon's drone competition, Gauntlet, begins later this month. US drone operators will fly and test the systems.",
    "fullText": "Over two dozen companies, including two from Ukraine, have been selected to build and test their small one-way attack drone prototypes for the first phase of a new Pentagon program focused on drone dominance.\n\nThe evaluation, Gauntlet, begins later this month at Fort Benning in Georgia, where military personnel will fly the designs, putting them to the test to inform purchasing decisions. When the testing concludes in March, the department will put in roughly $150 million in prototype delivery orders.\n\nThe Pentagon aims to ultimately, by 2027, field hundreds of thousands of low-cost, one-way attack drones.\n\nThe Pentagon released the list of 25 companies involved on Tuesday. It includes a lot of start-ups like Performance Drone Works LLC, which was an offshoot of the Drone Racing League, as well as vendors like Kratos SRE Inc., a subsidiary of the larger Kratos Defense.\n\nTwo Ukrainian companies are also competing in the Gauntlet evaluations: Ukrainian Defense Drone Tech Corp and General Cherry Corp. Both are major developers with years of experience building and upgrading first-person view one-way attack drones for the Ukrainian military.\n\nGeneral Cherry Corp was established in Zaporizhzhia early on in Russia's war against Ukraine and has been developing small uncrewed aerial systems for its forces. Per the company, its first-person-view one-way attack drones are employed across 40 different brigades, and they regularly use soldier feedback to improve their systems.\n\nLate last year, the company revealed its new AIR Pro interceptor drone designed to strike Russian reconnaissance and attack drones. The company said that the AIR Pro had been used on the front lines and demonstrated a speed of around 125 miles per hour.\n\nOn Facebook, General Cherry said its \"participation in the American defense program is a recognition of our combat experience and shows a high level of trust in Ukrainian engineering solutions.\"\n\nThere's little to no information publicly available on the company the Pentagon identified as Ukrainian Defense Drone Tech Corp. Local Ukrainian media identified it as a Ukrainian manufacturer; however, reports said the name was unfamiliar.\n\nAll of the vendors will have their systems tested and evaluated by military drone operators at Fort Benning, Georgia, starting February 18 and leading into early March. Then, DoD will pick drones for prototyping, place delivery orders worth approximately $150 million, and receive the drones over the following five months.\n\nThe Defense Department publicly unveiled its Drone Dominance Program in early December, signaling a push to rapidly acquire large numbers of low-cost attack drones.\n\nThese systems — which have reshaped combat in Ukraine and are becoming an increasingly important part of US testing and operations — were singled out by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as critical because they provide a far cheaper alternative to high-end, expensive munitions.\n\nInitial planning indicates the department intends to spend $1.1 billion on the program over four phases and regularly buy drones to offer a consistent demand signal to the US defense industry.\n\nThe beginning of the program follows announcements from President Donald Trump in June on supporting the American drone industry and arming troops and a memo from Hegseth in July.\n\n\"Drones are the biggest battlefield innovation in a generation, accounting for most of this year's casualties in Ukraine,\" Hegseth said in the July 2025 memo, adding that \"US units are not outfitted with the lethal small drones the modern battlefield requires.\"\n\n\"We are buying what works,\" he said, \"fast, at scale, and without bureaucratic delay.\"\n\nThe full list of defense companies participating in the DoD's Gauntlet competition are: Anno.ai Inc., Ascent Aerosystems Inc., Auterion Government Solutions Inc., Dzyne Technologies LLC, Ewing Aerospace LLC, Farage Precision LLC, Firestorm Labs Inc., General Cherry Corp., Greensight Inc., Griffon Aerospace Inc., Halo Aeronautics LLC, Kratos SRE Inc., ModalAI Inc., Napatree Technology LLC, Neros Inc., Nokturnal AI, Paladin Defense Services LLC, Performance Drone Works LLC, Responsibly Ltd., Swarm Defense Technologies LLC, Teal Drones Inc., Ukrainian Defense Drones Tech Corp., Vector Defense Inc., W.S.

Discovery, though WBD chose Netflix as its preferred acquirer — a decision Paramount is challenging with shareholders and in the courtroom.\n\nUnder Ellison, Paramount has also called most employees back to the office five days a week, made changes to its data and insights team, and looked to jazz up Paramount+ by exploring the addition of short-form video and interactive features.\n\nPersonnel shake-ups are common at companies with new leadership. Another change saw Paramount's head of streaming product and tech, Vibol Hou, leave the company at the end of January, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nHave a tip or Paramount-related story idea?

    "fullText": "Alphabet beat on the top and bottom lines in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, and said it expects to significantly increase spending on artificial intelligence in 2026.\n\nThe stock fell as much as 3% in extended trading.\n\nHere's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:\n\nWall Street was also watching several other numbers in the report:\n\nAlphabet said it expects 2026 capital expenditures to be in the range of $175 billion to $185 billion. The top end of that forecast would be more than double its 2025 spend. The company said in October that it expected \"a significant increase\" to capex in 2026.\n\nThe company's capex spend will go toward investing in AI compute capacity for Google DeepMind and to meet \"significant cloud customer demand as well as strategic investments in other bets,\" Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi told analysts on a call Wednesday. She added that it would be used to \"improve the user experience and drive higher advertiser ROI in Google services.\"\n\nThe company saw revenue increase almost 18% year over year. Net income came in at $34.46 billion, up almost 30% compared to the year prior.\n\nAdvertising revenue came in at $82.28 billion, up 13.5% from a year ago. Revenue for YouTube ads increased almost 9% to $11.38 billion, but it fell short of analysts' expectations of $11.84 billion.\n\nAshkenazi said \"advertising results were negatively affected from the lapping of the strong spend on U.S. election in the fourth quarter of 2024.\"\n\nGoogle Cloud beat Wall Street's expectations, recording a nearly 48% increase in revenue from a year ago. Google's Cloud unit houses most of the company's AI services and products.\n\nThat business's backlog increased 55% sequentially and more than doubled year over year, reaching $240 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, said Ashkenazi.\n\nAlphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on the call Wednesday that its Gemini AI app now has more than 750 million monthly active users, up from 650 million monthly active users last quarter.\n\n\"As we scale, we are getting dramatically more efficient,\" Pichai said. \"We were able to lower Gemini serving unit costs by 78% over 2025 through model optimizations, efficiency and utilization improvements.\"\n\nOther Bets, which includes the company's life sciences unit Verily and self-driving car unit Waymo, reported revenue of $370 million during the quarter, down 7.5% from a year ago. Alphabet reported Other Bets' loss of $3.61 billion, a year-over-year increase of more than 200%.\n\nWaymo took a $2.1 billion stock-based compensation charge for the quarter, as it raised a new funding round at a $16 billion valuation. The majority of the charge was reflected in expenses for research and development, Ashkenazi said.\n\nThe self-driving wing of Alphabet ended 2025 having served 15 million trips in five major U.S. markets, including Austin, Texas; Atlanta; Los Angeles; Phoenix; and the San Francisco Bay Area. In January, Waymo began operating its service in Miami.\n\nWATCH: Google DeepMind CEO on state of the AI race, push towards AGI and AI impact on jobs",

    "description": "Amazon stock has been a laggard among its Magnificent Seven peers, but Wall Street is bullish that the latest results will show AI-driven strength.",
    "fullText": "Amazon will be the latest Magnificent Seven company to report earnings this week, with the e-commerce giant's results due on Thursday after the closing bell.\n\nAs analysts noted in their pre-earnings takes, Amazon has lagged behind most of its mega-cap tech peers for much of the past year. Yet, despite the lackluster performance, many investment banks are optimistic that the company will reveal fresh growth from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and provide key AI updates.\n\nWall Street expects Amazon tp post earnings-per-share of $1.96 for the quarter and revenue of $211.2 billion to $211.56 billion. Analysts anticipate that Amazon's earnings before interest and taxes will be $24.6 billion.\n\nHere's what analysts say they will be listening for on Amazon's earnings call.\n\nBofA analyst Justin Post expects Amazon to come in slightly above Wall Street estimates on key metrics, predicting revenue of $213 billion and EBIT of $26 billion. He also thinks that AWS growth will accelerate in 2026, helping Amazon regain some momentum.\n\n\"We expect 22% y/y AWS growth (above Street at 21% and an accel from 20% in 3Q) as greater capacity drives incremental sales, and we think investors could also be around 22% y/y,\" he said.\n\nWhile JPMorgan analysts remain bullish on Amazon heading into earnings, they do note some concerns regarding Amazon's position and strategy when it comes to AI. They find the recent AWS price increases encouraging, though, as they indicate strong demand.\n\n\"We remain bullish on AWS growth acceleration driven by core cloud growth & ramping AI contribution led by Project Rainier, Trn ramp, & new partnerships,\" they wrote.\n\nThe analysts added, though, that despite some concern, AWS' growth and the company's cost discipline should support strong free cash flow growth in the coming year, even as Amazon ramps up AI capex.\n\nDeutsche Bank analysts aren't expecting Amazon's Q4 earnings report to quickly juice the stock's performance, but they do anticipate a positive quarter overall, particularly in e-commerce demand and AWS-driven revenue growth.\n\n\"While we don't expect 4Q earnings to be the magic bullet that changes these fortunes, we do expect another positive earnings outcome to continue to chip away at this underperformance and believe Amazon can be one of the largest outperformers in our coverage in 2026,\" stated analyst Lee Horowitz.\n\nUBS analyst Stephen Ju and his team increased their estimates for both AWS growth and Amazon's capex, citing the company's plans to double capacity by 2027.\n\n\"As 4Q25 results marks the second quarter of AWS acceleration, we expect investor conviction to continue to rise and drive outperformance as capital continues to rotate into AMZN shares,\" Ju stated in a note to investors.\n\nHe added that his team expects Amazon to benefit from its investments in areas such as gross merchandise volume, advertising, and data, which are expected to help increase its free cash flow.\n\nAmazon remains a top pick for Mizuho, who sees it as a winner of the online advertising boom. Analyst Lloyd Walmsley also thinks it stands to benefit from ongoing demand both for its AI services and its e-commerce business.\n\n\"As GenAI compute demand increasingly shifts to inference this plays to Amazon's strength and should help further boost revenues at AWS,\" he noted. \"On retail, we see ongoing cost-to-serve improvements from more automation in fulfillment centers and continued improvement in logistics architecture, aided by rapid growth in advertising driving improving retail margins.\"\n\nCorrection: February 4, 2026 — An earlier version of this story misstated the date of Amazon earnings as Wednesday. The report is on Thursday.",

    "description": "The problem with billionaires like Jeff Bezos owning news properties like The Washington Post is they can decide one day to turn off the spigot.",
    "fullText": "The cuts at The Washington Post are brutal.\n\nThey are brutal for the paper's readers, who lose crucial coverage like sports and international reporting. And they are brutal for hundreds of Post employees, including lots of people whose work I pay to read with my Post subscription.\n\nThe Post's cuts have also led lots of people to point out the obvious — that Post owner Jeff Bezos, who is currently the world's fourth-richest man, worth an estimated $261 billion, could easily fund the paper's losses … forever, without ever noticing the tab.\n\nJeff Bezos wealth in 2024: $194 billion\n\nJeff Bezos wealth in 2025: $215 billion\n\nJeff Bezos wealth today: $249.4 billion\n\nNet increase in Bezos wealth since 2024: $55.4 billion\n\nCost of Bezos’s 417-foot superyacht: $500 million\n\nAmazon investment in \"Melania\": $75 million…\n\nThe Washington Post lost $77 million in 2023.\n\nJeff Bezos just spent at least $75 million on an infomercial named “Melania” — $40 million paid to the President and First Lady. \n\nPriorities. https://t.co/dsC29R0pVi\n\nJeff Bezos just fired hundreds of reporters at the Washington Post — including the Amazon reporter holding his OWN company accountable.\n\nReminder: Jeff Bezos' net worth is nearly $250,000,000,000.\n\nFor the record: I also wish that Bezos would take his loose change and spend it on journalism.\n\nNote that I didn't say \"journalism instead of\" because when you are talking about Bezos-level wealth, you don't have to choose: You can pay for journalism and rockets and superyachts and Venetian weddings and parties in St. Barts. (And yes, I realize that Bezos' Amazon expenditures on things like the \"Melania\" doc are different from Bezos' personal spending. The point is, he can afford it. In the same way that I can afford to buy a fancy coffee now and then.)\n\nI'm also not weighing in on how much of the Post's problems are the same problems facing every news organization, versus ones Bezos exacerbated by pivoting toward Trump. Or whether the new Post plan — focus on a handful of topics it thinks will resonate with a national audience, like politics and wellness — makes sense or is simply a too-late move already made by many Post competitors.\n\nBut the focus on Bezos underscores the problem the Post has been facing for years: It was a money-losing operation that relied on a billionaire's goodwill. First, to buy it from its previous owners, who let it go for the price of a Joe Rogan podcast deal, and then to fund its losses for years.\n\nMaybe Bezos really is sick of paying for the Post's losses. Maybe funding the Post no longer syncs with a turns out, Donald Trump is actually good now, worldview. The point is that the Post has been in the can't-win position of hoping Jeff Bezos would continue to fund those losses for years. Now he doesn't want to. (Bezos has yet to comment publicly on the cuts; Matt Murray, the Post's top editor, told his staff that the cuts are meant to help \"reinvent The Washington Post for this new era. This work is difficult, but is essential.\")\n\nWhich, again, points out how precarious a position just about every news organization in the US is in right now.\n\nThere are a handful of really excellent publications, which are controlled by billionaires or very wealthy families — The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Bloomberg News — that are aimed at an upscale, national audience, and they are doing well. There are some thriving startups and niche publications that tend to focus on topics that rich people — or their employers — will pay to learn more about. (Several of them, it turns out, are focused on power and Washington, DC — a sector the Post should have owned.) And there are various forms of aggregators that make a living by repackaging news other people generate, like newsletter publisher 1440.\n\nAnd that's … kind of it. The local news market is so bad we routinely use the word \"desert\" to describe it. There have been many attempts to solve that, and people keep trying new ways to tackle the problem. I wish all of them well because we really, really need local news. TV news is contracting because TV is contracting. Magazines are now frequently \"brands attached to hotels or travel agencies.\"\n\nFaced with this grim reality, it's natural to look at Bezos and think: Just pay for it. And again — I wish he would. But relying on billionaire goodwill is a hope, not a plan.\n\nJournalism — no matter how much we right-size, automate, and innovate — is expensive. And up until the internet, journalism usually existed in the US in spite of those costs because it was bundled with other things people (subscribers, advertisers) were willing to pay for.\n\nNow that bundle has been torn apart, so we need both new models that support what we have today — and ownership structures that will be satisfied with self-sustaining businesses, not ones with huge profit expectations. If I knew how to do that, I'd be doing it. I just know that hoping a billionaire will fix it isn't the answer.",

    "title": "5 of the biggest takeaways from Google's Q4 2025 earnings call",
    "description": "Alphabet's Q4 results beat estimates. Google plans to double capex in 2026, while search and cloud remained strong.",
    "fullText": "Google just reported another blockbuster quarter, with its fourth-quarter revenue soaring past Wall Street expectations,\n\nThat said, you might not think it to look at the stock, which took a dip after Google announced it planned to double its capital expenditure in 2026, predicting it will spend between $175 billion and $185 billion — far beyond analysts' prior expectations.\n\nSome upbeat numbers softened the blow, with Google's search advertising and cloud business running hot. Google announced its annual revenue had exceeded $400 billion for the first time, while quarterly revenue hit $113.8 billion, above estimates of $111 billion. Google Cloud became a particularly bright spot, with revenues up 48% year over year.\n\nHere are the biggest takeaways from Alphabet's earnings call.\n\nLet's get the big one out of the way. Google said on Wednesday that it expects capital expenditures of between $175 billion and $185 billion in 2026. That's the money going to data centers, chips, construction materials, and other components needed to build out and support Google's AI efforts.\n\nIt's a huge figure. Google previously warned that its capex spend would be higher than last year's, when it spent just over $90 billion. Its updated guidance for 2026 surpassed street expectations and sent the stock tumbling 2% after its otherwise very healthy earnings report.\n\nGoogle's capex estimate is even higher than Meta's, which last week said it expects to spend between $115 billion and $135 billion for 2026, nearly doubling its spend from last year.\n\nGoogle said its Gemini app now has over 750 million monthly active users. That's 100 million more than it had in October last year.\n\n\"We are also seeing significantly higher engagement per user, especially since the launch of Gemini 3 in December,\" said Google CEO Sundar Pichai on the call on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the graph trends in the right direction, it also suggests a slowdown, as Google said in October that it had gained 200 million extra users over Q3, aided by the rollout of its viral Nano Banana image generator.\n\nGoogle said on Wednesday that it now has over 325 million paid subscriptions across its consumer services, with Google One and YouTube Premium the most popular.\n\nTo put that number in perspective, Netflix announced last month it had also hit 325 million subscribers. It's not a total like-for-like comparison — Netflix doesn't have a cloud storage product, for one. Still, with YouTube clearly taking a big chunk of those users, it should be enough to alarm Netflix's leaders.\n\nGoogle likes to talk up its full-stack AI advantage. By owning everything from AI models to cloud servers and chips, Google gains more control over the technology and how it all fits together.\n\nOn Wednesday's call, Pichai flagged that Google was seeing significant benefits from this, lowering Gemini's serving unit costs by 78% over 2025 \"through model optimizations, efficiency, and utilization improvements.\"\n\nSoftware stocks took a hammering this week after Anthropic rolled out new features that could perform clerical and administrative tasks for people in the legal industry.\n\nCould this be another \"DeepSeek moment,\" as Evercore senior managing director Mark Mahaney suggested on the call? Pichai suggested the scramble this week might be overblown.\n\n\"I think it is an enabling tool, just like it has been an enabling tool for us across our products and services, be it Search, YouTube, etc,\" Pichai said of Gemini, saying that companies that are \"seizing the moment\" will \"have the same opportunity ahead.\"\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "An error occurred while preparing your download\n\nChlamydia pneumoniae—a common bacterium that causes pneumonia and sinus infections—can linger in the eye and brain for years and may aggravate Alzheimer’s disease, according to a study from Cedars-Sinai. Published in Nature Communications, the discovery suggests this bacterium can amplify Alzheimer’s disease and points to potential interventions including inflammation-limiting therapies and early antibiotic treatment.\n\nThe study shows for the first time that Chlamydia pneumoniae can reach the retina—the tissue lining the back of the eye—where it triggers immune responses linked to inflammation, nerve cell death and cognitive decline.\n\n“Seeing Chlamydia pneumoniae consistently across human tissues, cell cultures and animal models allowed us to identify a previously unrecognized link between bacterial infection, inflammation and neurodegeneration,” said Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui, PhD, professor of Neurosurgery, Neurology, and Biomedical Sciences at Cedars-Sinai Health Sciences University and the leading, senior author of the study. “The eye is a surrogate for the brain, and this study shows that retinal bacterial infection and chronic inflammation can reflect brain pathology and predict disease status, supporting retinal imaging as a noninvasive way to identify people at risk for Alzheimer’s.”\n\nTo conduct the study, researchers used advanced imaging, genetic testing and protein analysis to examine retinal tissue from 104 individuals, some with normal cognition, some with mild cognitive impairment and some with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nThey found significantly higher levels of Chlamydia pneumoniae in the retinas and brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease than they found in people with normal cognition. The higher the bacterial levels detected, the more severe the brain changes and cognitive decline investigators found.\n\nHigher levels of the bacterium were more common in people who carried the APOE4 gene variant, a known risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nInvestigators also studied human neurons in the lab and in laboratory mice with Alzheimer’s disease. In both, infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae increased inflammation, nerve cell death and cognitive decline, showing the bacterium can accelerate disease processes. The infection also triggered production of amyloid-beta, the protein that accumulates in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.\n\nThe findings were driven by co-first authors Bhakta Gaire, PhD, and Yosef Koronyo, MSc.\n\n“This discovery raises the possibility of targeting the infection-inflammation axis to treat Alzheimer’s,” said Timothy Crother, PhD, co-corresponding author of the study and research professor at Cedars-Sinai Guerin Children's and the Department of Biomedical Sciences at Cedars‑Sinai.\n\nThe findings suggest that targeting chronic bacterial infection—and the inflammation it triggers—could represent a new treatment strategy. The research also supports potential use of the retina as a noninvasive way to help diagnose and monitor the disease.\n\nAdditional Cedars-Sinai authors include Bhakta Gaire, Yosef Koronyo, Jean-Philippe Vit, Alexandre Hutton, Lalita Subedi, Dieu-Trang Fuchs, Natalie Swerdlow, Altan Rentsendorj, Saba Shahin, Daisy Martinon, Edward Robinson, Alexander V.

    "fullText": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation has so far been unable to access data from a Washington Post reporter’s iPhone because it was protected by Apple’s Lockdown Mode when agents seized the device from the reporter’s home, the US government said in a court filing.\n\nFBI agents were able to access the reporter’s work laptop by telling her to place her index finger on the MacBook Pro’s fingerprint reader, however. This occurred during the January 14 search at the Virginia home of reporter Hannah Natanson.\n\nAs previously reported, the FBI executed a search warrant at Natanson’s home as part of an investigation into a Pentagon contractor accused of illegally leaking classified data. FBI agents seized an iPhone 13 owned by the Post, one MacBook Pro owned by the Post and another MacBook Pro owned by Natanson, a 1TB portable hard drive, a voice recorder, and a Garmin watch.\n\nGovernment investigators want to read Natanson’s Signal messages, and were able to view at least some of them on her work laptop. The reporter has said she has a contact list of 1,100 current and former government employees in Signal, which she uses for encrypted chats.\n\nThe Justice Department described the search in a court filing that was submitted Friday in US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and noted in a 404 Media article today. The government filing opposes a motion in which the Post and Natanson asked the court to order the return of the seized devices. A federal magistrate judge previously issued a standstill order telling the government to stop searching the devices until the court rules on whether they must be returned.\n\n“The iPhone was found powered on and charging, and its display noted that the phone was in ‘Lockdown’ mode,” the government filing said. After the seized devices were taken to the FBI’s Washington field office, the Computer Analysis Response Team (CART) “began processing each device to preserve the information therein,” the filing said.\n\nCART couldn’t get anything from the iPhone. “Because the iPhone was in Lockdown mode, CART could not extract that device,” the government filing said.\n\nThe government also submitted a declaration by FBI Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky that said the agency “has paused any further efforts to extract this device because of the Court’s Standstill Order.” The FBI did extract information from the SIM card “with an auto-generated HTML report created by the tool utilized by CART,” but “the data contained in the HTML was limited to the telephone number.”\n\nApple says that LockDown Mode “helps protect devices against extremely rare and highly sophisticated cyber attacks,” and is “designed for the very few individuals who, because of who they are or what they do, might be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats.”\n\nIntroduced in 2022, Lockdown Mode is available for iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It must be enabled separately for each device. To enable it on an iPhone or iPad, a user would open the Settings app, tap Privacy & Security, scroll down and tap Lockdown Mode, and then tap Turn on Lockdown Mode.\n\nThe process is similar on Macs. In the System Settings app that can be accessed via the Apple menu, a user would click Privacy & Security, scroll down and click Lockdown Mode, and then click Turn On.\n\n“When Lockdown Mode is enabled, your device won’t function like it typically does,” Apple says. “To reduce the attack surface that potentially could be exploited by highly targeted mercenary spyware, certain apps, websites, and features are strictly limited for security and some experiences might not be available at all.”\n\nLockdown Mode blocks most types of message attachments, blocks FaceTime calls from people you haven’t contacted in the past 30 days, restricts the kinds of browser technologies that websites can use, limits photo sharing, and imposes other restrictions. Users can exclude specific apps and websites they trust from these restrictions, however.\n\nFBI agents had more success getting into Natanson’s other devices, though the Justice Department complained that “Ms. Natanson misled investigators about the devices that were seized. She misrepresented to officers that the devices could not be unlocked with biometrics, possibly in order to prevent the Government from reviewing materials within the scope of the search warrant.”\n\nThe Rozhavsky declaration said that during the home search, FBI agents “advised Natanson that the FBI could not compel her to provide her passcodes,” but “the warrant did give the FBI authority to use Natanson’s biometrics, such as facial recognition or fingerprints, to open her devices. Natanson stated that she did not use biometrics on her devices.”\n\nNatanson’s personal MacBook Pro was powered off when it was found by FBI agents. The Post-owned MacBook Pro was found in a backpack in the kitchen and was powered on and locked. The FBI said an agent “presented Natanson with her open laptop” and “assisted” her in unlocking the device with her finger. The declaration described what happened as follows:\n\nNatanson was reminded the FBI has authority to use her biometrics to unlock the laptop and Natanson repeated that she does not use biometrics on her devices. Natanson was told she must try, in accordance with the authorization in the warrant. The FBI assisted Natanson with applying her right index finger to the fingerprint reader which immediately unlocked the laptop.\n\nIn 2024, a federal appeals court ruled that the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination does not prohibit police officers from forcing a suspect to unlock a phone with a thumbprint scan. That case involved a traffic stop, rather than a home search authorized by a warrant.\n\nThe FBI has so far been unable “to obtain a full physical image” of Natanson’s work laptop, but did make a “limited partial live logical image,” the government filing said. At least some of Natanson’s Signal chat messages were set for auto-deletion, so FBI agents took photos and made audio recordings of the chats, but the government filing said this was done “only for preservation purposes and no substantive review has occurred.”\n\nThe FBI apparently hasn’t gotten any data from Natanson’s personal computer. “Natanson’s personal MacBook Pro is password protected and encrypted and therefore no imaging was effected. The FBI paused any further efforts because of [the] Court’s Standstill Order. No review has occurred,” Rozhavsky wrote.\n\nThe government said it processed data from the voice recorder and 1TB hard drive but has not reviewed the data yet. The Garmin watch wasn’t processed before the court issued a standstill order; “therefore, no processing will occur until further order of the Court,” the declaration said.\n\nThe investigation’s target is Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator in Maryland who has a top-secret security clearance and was arrested after being accused of taking classified intelligence reports home. The Justice Department said Washington Post articles contained classified information from those reports, and that the government should be allowed to review the Post reporter’s seized devices in preparation for Perez-Lugones’ trial.\n\nThe government said it was able to read at least some of the Signal messages by reviewing Perez-Lugones’ device. “Prior to his arrest, the FBI consensually reviewed messages between Mr. Perez-Lugones and Ms. Natanson sent via Signal on or around January 7 and 8, 2026… The messages discussed the classification level of certain documents, set forth details about which US government agencies had produced different reports, and explained how certain documents would be referenced in forthcoming news articles,” the Justice Department court filing said.\n\nThe Post argues that a wide-ranging government search of Natanson’s various devices violates the First Amendment and that the government’s legitimate interests could be satisfied with a more limited subpoena. The government claims in response that the Washington Post wants the court “to reimagine the First Amendment as a journalist’s exception to search warrants.”\n\n“Under the reasonableness standard of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g), the Government is entitled to maintain this evidence because it is relevant to an ongoing investigation and prosecution,” the Justice Department said. “In addition, the Government cannot be reasonably required to hand over to Movants devices that the Government has probable cause to believe contain its own highly classified information.”\n\nThe government said the Post’s suggestion of a subpoena for specific information from the devices “ignores the obvious risk that evidence could be lost either through a failure to preserve expiring Signal messages or bad faith conduct.” Natanson’s false claim that she did not use biometrics suggests that the Post and Natanson can’t be trusted to preserve documents, the brief said.\n\n“The record confirms the correctness of the Government’s choice to proceed with a search warrant,” the Justice Department said.\n\nThe Post/Natanson motion was supported in a brief filed by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. The FBI “seiz[ed] electronic devices that contain [Natanson’s] most sensitive work product alongside confidential communications with her sources,” the brief said. “Only a fraction of the information the Department seized is even imaginably relevant to its stated basis for that intrusion: the leak investigation of a government contractor who has already been identified, charged, and arrested.” The brief urged the court to stop federal agents from searching through “unrelated newsgathering material and doing irreparable damage to the confidentiality on which effective reporting depends.”",

    "title": "Samsung Has Killed Software Support for Most of the Galaxy S21 Series",
    "description": "Samsung's 2024 \"seven-year promise\" doesn't apply to previous models.",
    "fullText": "Starting with 2024's Galaxy S24 series, Samsung started promising seven years of software support for its new phones, following a precedent Google set with the Pixel 8. It was a surprisingly user-friendly and even environmentally conscious move, letting buyers more easily keep their phones for longer while also reducing e-waste generated from constant upgrades. Unfortunately, it didn't apply to previous models, and now we're starting to see the consequences of that.\n\nIn Samsung's February 2026 security updates (first spotted by SamMobile), the Galaxy S21, S21+, and S21 Ultra are nowhere to be seen, indicating that they've reached their end of support. The only phone from this line still listed was the S21 FE 5G, which makes sense, since it was released a year after the rest of the S21 line. That means these phones will no longer get regular monthly or quarterly security updates, although if a critical vulnerability pops up, Samsung might still issue an emergency fix.\n\nNone of this should be surprising, but it can still be confusing if you're an S21 owner. To be fair to Samsung, the company only ever pledged five years of support for the S21 series on release, and only four years of Android updates. But as far as hardware goes, your phone is probably still running just fine. The Snapdragon 888 chip powering the S21 series is snappy enough for casual use, even if it can be a bit power hungry. Do you really need to replace it, especially so soon after launch?\n\nAs far as browsing the internet, watching videos, and scrolling social media apps goes, your Galaxy S21 phone should still hold up well. Gaming and other more demanding tasks might suffer, but there shouldn't be anything physically wrong with your phone aside from aging. The problem comes when you start to consider safety.\n\nRegular security updates help patch holes hackers can use to get into your data or accounts. And these days, hackers have gotten pretty smart. While you might know to avoid sketchy websites or high-risk apps, there are exploits hackers can use now that don't need any interaction from you. Sometimes, all it takes is having a Bluetooth radio in your device, or for the hacker to know your phone number.\n\nGetting hit by one of these hacks might be rare, but it's not a good idea to leave yourself open to the possibility if you can avoid it. It's like driving in a car without a seatbelt—you probably won't get in a crash, but you'll wish you had one if you do. Upgrading to a phone getting official security updates from the manufacturer is the best way to ensure your handset has the most up-to-date safety, but if you can't, there are a few steps you can take to protect yourself.\n\nGetting over-the-air updates directly from your phone's manufacturer is the best way to stay safe while using your phone, but they're not the only way to get security updates. Starting with Android 10, which the Galaxy S21 series does fall under, Google's Project Mainline began delivering partial security updates via Google Play System Updates.\n\nThese won't close all vulnerabilities, but they do allow Google to patch holes in media codecs and components, permissions, and a few other features hackers like to exploit, even on devices that no longer get official manufacturer support. \"With Project Mainline, we can deliver faster security fixes for critical security bugs,\" the company said in a blog post. \"For example, by modularizing media components, which accounts for nearly 40% of recently patched vulnerabilities.\"\n\nProject Mainline can't fix everything, especially problems related to your specific device, but if you do find that your phone is out of date, it's worth ensuring your Google Play System Updates are updated to the most recent version until you can find a new one. How to check this will differ from device to device, but you'll generally find these updates under Settings > System > Software updates. Here, you'll see a date showing which Google Play system update your phone is running. These should normally update manually every month, but if the date looks a little old, you can simply tap it to search for a fresh update and download it.\n\nIdeally, you should take the end of software support as a sign to upgrade to a new phone, even if it appears to be working fine. But I get any hesitation you might be feeling. I'm still on Windows 10, which is facing its own security update issues, even though my device still works perfectly for everything I want from it. I'm glad to see companies catching on with extended security updates, so hopefully this will become less of an issue in the future. Tech timelines move fast, but a five-year upgrade cycle feels a lot more wasteful than even a seven-year one.\n\nFor now, though, keep in mind that any Samsung phone released before 2024 is going to face an end-of-life sooner than you might think, so it's time to start planning for it accordingly. The company might have moved on to seven years of updates now, but that promise doesn't apply retroactively. So Galaxy S22 owners, it's time to start thinking about what you'll do with your own devices next year.",

    "description": "The vision of human-level machine intelligence laid out by Alan Turing in the 1950s is now a reality. Eyes unclouded by dread or hype will help us to prepare for what comes next.",
    "fullText": "In 1950, in a paper entitled ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence’1, Alan Turing proposed his ‘imitation game’. Now known as the Turing test, it addressed a question that seemed purely hypothetical: could machines display the kind of flexible, general cognitive competence that is characteristic of human thought, such that they could pass themselves off as humans to unaware humans?\n\nThree-quarters of a century later, the answer looks like ‘yes’. In March 2025, the large language model (LLM) GPT-4.5, developed by OpenAI in San Francisco, California, was judged by humans in a Turing test to be human 73% of the time — more often than actual humans were2. Moreover, readers even preferred literary texts generated by LLMs over those written by human experts3.\n\nThis is far from all. LLMs have achieved gold-medal performance at the International Mathematical Olympiad, collaborated with leading mathematicians to prove theorems4, generated scientific hypotheses that have been validated in experiments5, solved problems from PhD exams, assisted professional programmers in writing code, composed poetry and much more — including chatting 24/7 with hundreds of millions of people around the world. In other words, LLMs have shown many signs of the sort of broad, flexible cognitive competence that was Turing’s focus — what we now call ‘general intelligence’, although Turing did not use the term.\n\nYet many experts baulk at saying that current AI models display artificial general intelligence (AGI) — and some doubt that they ever will. A March 2025 survey by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in Washington DC found that 76% of leading researchers thought that scaling up current AI approaches would be ‘unlikely’ or ‘very unlikely’ to yield AGI (see go.nature.com/4smn16b).\n\nWhat explains this disconnect? We suggest that the problem is part conceptual, because definitions of AGI are ambiguous and inconsistent; part emotional, because AGI raises fear of displacement and disruption; and part practical, as the term is entangled with commercial interests that can distort assessments. Precisely because AGI dominates public discourse, it is worth engaging with the concept in a more detached way: as a question about intelligence, rather than a pressing concern about social upheaval or an ever-postponed milestone in a business contract.\n\nIn writing this Comment, we approached this question from different perspectives — philosophy, machine learning, linguistics and cognitive science — and reached a consensus after extensive discussion. In what follows, we set out why we think that, once you clear away certain confusions, and strive to make fair comparisons and avoid anthropocentric biases, the conclusion is straightforward: by reasonable standards, including Turing’s own, we have artificial systems that are generally intelligent. The long-standing problem of creating AGI has been solved. Recognizing this fact matters — for policy, for risk and for understanding the nature of mind and even the world itself.\n\nWe assume, as we think Turing would have done, that humans have general intelligence. Some think that general intelligence does not exist at all, even in humans. Although this view is coherent and philosophically interesting, we set it aside here as being too disconnected from most AI discourse. But having made this assumption, how should we characterize general intelligence?\n\nA common informal definition of general intelligence, and the starting point of our discussions, is a system that can do almost all cognitive tasks that a human can do6,7. What tasks should be on that list engenders a lot of debate, but the phrase ‘a human’ also conceals a crucial ambiguity. Does it mean a top human expert for each task? Then no individual qualifies — Marie Curie won Nobel prizes in chemistry and physics but was not an expert in number theory. Does it mean a composite human with competence across the board? This, too, seems a high bar — Albert Einstein revolutionized physics, but he couldn’t speak Mandarin.\n\nA definition that excludes essentially all humans is not a definition of general intelligence; it is about something else, perhaps ideal expertise or collective intelligence. Rather, general intelligence is about having sufficient breadth and depth of cognitive abilities, with ‘sufficient’ anchored by paradigm cases. Breadth means abilities across multiple domains — mathematics, language, science, practical reasoning, creative tasks — in contrast to ‘narrow’ intelligences, such as a calculator or a chess-playing program. Depth means strong performance within those domains, not merely superficial engagement.\n\nHuman general intelligence admits degrees and variation. Children, average adults and an acknowledged genius such as Einstein all have general intelligence of varying level and profile. Individual humans excel or fall short in different domains. The same flexibility should apply to artificial systems: we should ask whether they have the core cognitive abilities at levels comparable to human-level general intelligence.\n\nRather than stipulating a definition, we draw on both actual and hypothetical cases of general intelligence — from Einstein to aliens to oracles — to triangulate the contours of the concept and refine it more systematically. Our conclusion: insofar as individual humans have general intelligence, current LLMs do, too.\n\nWe can start by identifying four features that are not required for general intelligence.\n\nPerfection. We don’t expect a physicist to match Einstein’s insights, or a biologist to replicate Charles Darwin’s breakthroughs. Few, if any, humans have perfect depth even within specialist areas of competence. Human general intelligence does not require perfection; neither should AGI.\n\nUniversality. No individual human can do every cognitive task, and other species have abilities that exceed our own: an octopus can control its eight arms independently; many insects can see parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that are invisible to humans. General intelligence does not require universal mastery of these skills; an AGI does not need perfect breadth.\n\nHuman similarity. Intelligence is a functional property that can be realized in different substrates — a point Turing embraced in 1950 by setting aside human biology1. Systems demonstrating general intelligence need not replicate human cognitive architecture or understand human cultural references. We would not demand these things of intelligent aliens; the same applies to machines.\n\nSuperintelligence. This is generally used to indicate any system that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in almost all areas. Superintelligence and AGI are often conflated, particularly in business contexts, in which ‘superintelligence’ often signals economic disruption. No human meets this standard; it should not be a requirement for AGI, either.\n\nWhat, then, is general intelligence? There is no ‘bright line’ test for its presence — any exact threshold is inevitably arbitrary. This might frustrate those who want exact criteria, but the vagueness is a feature, not a bug. Concepts such as ‘life’ and ‘health’ resist sharp definition yet remain useful; we recognize paradigm cases without needing exact boundaries. Humans are paradigm examples of general intelligence; a pocket calculator lacks it, despite superhuman ability at calculations.\n\nWhen we assess general intelligence or ability in other humans, we do not attempt to peer inside their heads to verify understanding — we infer it from behaviour, conversation and problem-solving. No single test is definitive, but evidence accumulates. The same applies to artificial systems.\n\nJust as we assess human general intelligence through progressively demanding tests, from basic literacy to PhD examinations, we can consider a cascade of increasingly demanding evidence that warrants progressively higher confidence in the presence of AGI.\n\nTuring-test level. Markers comparable to a basic school education: passing standard school exams, holding adequate conversations and performing simple reasoning. A decade ago, meeting these might have been widely accepted as sufficiently strong evidence for AGI.\n\nExpert level. Here, the demands escalate: gold-medal performance at international competitions, solving problems on PhD exams across multiple fields, writing and debugging complex code, fluency in dozens of languages, useful frontier research assistance as well as competent creative and practical problem-solving, from essay writing to trip planning. These achievements exceed many depictions of AGI in science fiction. The sentient supercomputer HAL 9000, from director Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, exhibited less breadth than current LLMs do. And current LLMs even exceed what we demand of humans: we credit individual people with general intelligence on the basis of much weaker evidence.\n\nSuperhuman level. Revolutionary scientific discoveries and consistent superiority over leading human experts across a range of domains. Such evidence would surely allow no reasonable debate about the presence of general intelligence in a machine — but it is not required evidence for its presence, because no human shows this.\n\nCurrent LLMs already cover the first two levels. As LLMs tackle progressively more difficult problems, alternative explanations for their capabilities — for instance, that they are gigantic ‘lookup tables’8 that retrieve pre-computed answers or ‘stochastic parrots’9 that regurgitate shallow regularities without grasping meaning or structure — become increasingly disconfirmed.\n\nOften, however, such claims just reappear with different predictions. Hypotheses that retreat before each new success, always predicting failure just beyond current achievements, are not compelling scientific theories, but a dogmatic commitment to perpetual scepticism.\n\nWe think the current evidence is clear. By inference to the best explanation — the same reasoning we use in attributing general intelligence to other people — we are observing AGI of a high degree. Machines such as those envisioned by Turing have arrived. Similar arguments have been made before10 (see also go.nature.com/49p6voq), and have engendered controversy and push-back. Our argument benefits from substantial advances and extra time. As of early 2026, the case for AGI is considerably more clear-cut.\n\nWe now examine ten common objections to the idea that current LLMs display general intelligence. Several of them echo objections that Turing himself considered in 1950. Each, we suggest, either conflates general intelligence with non-essential aspects of intelligence or applies standards that individual humans fail to meet.\n\nThey’re just parrots. The stochastic parrot objection says that LLMs merely interpolate training data. They can only recombine patterns they’ve encountered, so they must fail on genuinely new problems, or ‘out-of-distribution generalization’. This echoes ‘Lady Lovelace’s Objection’, inspired by Ada Lovelace’s 1843 remark and formulated by Turing as the claim that machines can “never do anything really new”1. Early LLMs certainly made mistakes on problems requiring reasoning and generalization beyond surface patterns in training data. But current LLMs can solve new, unpublished maths problems, perform near-optimal in-context statistical inference on scientific data11 and exhibit cross-domain transfer, in that training on code improves general reasoning across non-coding domains12. If critics demand revolutionary discoveries such as Einstein’s relativity, they are setting the bar too high, because very few humans make such discoveries either. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that human intelligence is not itself a sophisticated version of a stochastic parrot. All intelligence, human or artificial, must extract structure from correlational data; the question is how deep the extraction goes.\n\nThey lack world models. LLMs supposedly lack representations of their physical environment that are necessary for genuine understanding. But having a world model requires only the ability to predict what would happen if circumstances differed — to answer counterfactual questions. Ask a cutting-edge LLM what differs between dropping a glass or a pillow on a tile floor, and it will correctly predict shattering in one case and not the other. The ability of LLMs to solve olympiad mathematics and physics problems and assist with engineering design suggests that they possess functional models of physical principles. By these standards, LLMs already have world models. Furthermore, neural networks developed for specialized domains such as autonomous driving are already learning predictive models of physical scenes that support counterfactual reasoning and sophisticated physical awareness13.\n\nThey understand only words. This objection centres on the fact that LLMs are trained only on text, and so must be fundamentally limited to text-based tasks. Frontier models are now trained on images and other multimodal data, making this objection somewhat obsolete. Moreover, language is humanity’s most powerful tool for compressing and capturing knowledge about reality. LLMs can extract this compressed knowledge and apply it to distinctly non-linguistic tasks: helping researchers to design experiments — for example, suggesting what to test next in biology and materials science4 — goes beyond merely linguistic performance. We are yet to encounter the sharp limitations to LLM performance that this objection predicts.\n\nThey don’t have bodies. Without embodiment, critics argue, there can be no general intelligence. This reflects an anthropocentric bias that seems to be wielded only against AI. People would ascribe intelligence to a disembodied alien communicating by radio, or to a brain sustained in a vat. An entity that responds accurately to any question, but never moves or acts physically, would be regarded as profoundly intelligent. Physicist Stephen Hawking interacted with the world almost entirely through text and synthesized speech, yet his physical limitations in no way diminished his intelligence. Motor capabilities are separable from general intelligence.\n\nThey lack agency. It is true that present-day LLMs do not form independent goals or initiate action unprompted, as humans do. Even ‘agentic’ AI systems — such as frontier coding agents — typically act only when a user triggers a task, even if they can then automatically draft features and fix bugs. But intelligence does not require autonomy. Like the Oracle of Delphi — understood as a system that produces accurate answers only when queried — current LLMs need not initiate goals to count as intelligent. Humans typically have both general intelligence and autonomy, but we should not thereby conclude that one requires the other. Autonomy matters for moral responsibility, but it is not constitutive of intelligence.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-026-00285-6\n\nTuring, A. M.

    "title": "That Text About a Suspicious Apple Pay Transaction Is Probably a Scam",
    "description": "Apple doesn't reach out to its users that way.",
    "fullText": "A new phishing scam is targeting Apple Pay users, attempting to lock them into phony support calls or emails that could see them handing over their passwords and credit card numbers. The news was first highlighted by AppleInsider and involves warnings that look suspiciously like official Apple messaging. While AppleInsider's report doesn't link to any specific user complaints of this happening, it does include example screenshots, and reports matching AppleInsider's description have popped up on both Reddit and Apple's official support forums over the last 30 days.\n\nThe scam might come over either email or text, and usually warns the recipient about a potentially fraudulent purchase made using their Apple Pay at a physical Apple Store, while offering a phone number or email to contact to address the issue. According to AppleInsider, it might also include a case ID, timestamp, or other technical details in order to appear more legitimate. One user on Reddit, for instance, considered that the scam might be a legitimate text from Apple because it included the official sounding phrase \"If this was you, no action is needed.\"\n\nHowever, inconsistencies remain, such as the scam often referring to Apple Accounts as Apple IDs, a now outdated term. Additionally, while emails might use official looking letterhead that makes them appear to come straight from Apple, mistakes could remain. For instance, an email could open with \"Hello {Name}\" instead of being addressed to the recipient's actual name. It could come from a bogus address, but even appearing to come from a legitimate source like \"[email protected]\" isn't a strong indicator that it's real, as it's possible for scammers to spoof email addresses. Overall, the idea seems to be to speed the recipient into action with an urgent tone, while using Apple's logo and a professional writing style to mask any clues as to who is really sending these notices.\n\nIf you are receiving any texts or emails about your Apple Pay activity at all, chances are they probably aren't real—Apple doesn't reach out to its users in this way. Rather than sending texts or emails, communication instead comes directly from the Wallet app. Additionally, Apple Pay serves as a medium for payment rather than as a credit or debit account in and of itself. As such, if any fraudulent transactions are detected, notices would come from your bank or credit card provider rather than Apple itself.\n\nStill, it is worth keeping an eye out for any red flags as well. Look for small typos or unusual domain names, which can help give a fake message away, even if a lack of these isn't an indicator that a message is legitimate. Also, rather than calling any provided phone numbers, consider searching for them online to see whether they've been reported as being tied to a scam operation. At any rate, do not respond to these notices, and don't provide any information (such as passwords, which Apple will never ask for) to them if you've already reached out by accident. There are better ways to verify your Apple Pay activity.\n\nIf you think a message you've received is illegitimate, the best thing you can do is ignore it and verify it independently. Instead of responding to the suspicious text or email directly, or calling any provided phone numbers, double check any claims made in the statement through official Apple channels. You can see your recent Apple Pay purchases in the Wallet app by tapping on one of your registered cards, and opening the Settings app and navigating to Media & Purchases > View Account > Purchase History will show you any recent App Store purchases. If you don't see a transaction mentioned in one of these notices in your official payment history, chance are it never happened.\n\nIf you're still in doubt you have options. Rather than reaching out to an email or phone number linked in a potential scam notice, start fresh with a new message straight to Apple's official support. You can find the proper contact details, including an official Apple phone number for your region, on Apple's website. The company will be able to determine whether it's seen any suspicious activity tied to your account.\n\nFinally, once you're certain a message is part of a scam, you can forward it (or simply report it, if forwarding isn't possible) to Apple to help the company shut it down. The specific email address you'll want to use will differ based on the type of message, and you can find all your options on Apple's support website, under \"How to report suspicious emails, messages, and calls.\" Once you've sent the message to the correct channels, delete it from your inbox to keep yourself from accidentally clicking any compromised links. As added security, also consider changing your Apple Account password, or using a password manager.",

    "fullText": "Swansea Council says it has been told that regional rugby in Swansea will not exist beyond the end of next season if a takeover of Cardiff by Ospreys' owners Y11 Sport & Media is successful.\n\nIn a statement after a meeting with Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) and Ospreys officials, the council said it had issued a pre-action legal letter to the WRU and Y11, warning of legal action if the restructure of Welsh professional rugby was not paused.\n\nThe WRU wants to reduce the number of men's professional teams in Wales from four to three, which could be achieved by eliminating Ospreys as a top-tier side through a takeover process of Cardiff by Ospreys' owners Y11 Sport & Media.\n\nThe WRU said the Swansea Council statement was inaccurate, but confirmed it had received the pre-action legal letter.\n\nOspreys say \"no decisions have been made regarding Ospreys' future after the 2026-27 season, and no statements have been made by Lance Bradley [chief executive] or anyone else associated with Ospreys which contradict that.\"\n\nY11 have also been asked to comment.\n\nA public meeting to discuss the Ospreys' future was held on Wednesday evening hosted by Swansea Council, which former Ospreys players such as Alun Wyn Jones, James King, Andrew Bishop and Paul James attended along with hundreds of people.\n\nSwansea Council had said it would publish the minutes of the meeting, which took place on 22 January, but in its most recent statement claimed they had not done so because the WRU, Y11, and Ospreys objected to it.\n\nThe 22 January meeting included officials from Swansea Council, the WRU chief executive Abi Tierney, and Ospreys chief executive Lance Bradley.\n\nIn a statement, the council listed a number of what it called \"key facts\" that it claims were said at the 22 January meeting.\n\nThe statement includes that Bradley confirmed there would not be a professional Ospreys team playing regional rugby after 2027 if the takeover of Cardiff by Y11 went ahead.\n\nIt is claimed that Bradley also said a merger with Swansea RFC could follow, which would see a team competing in the semi professional Super Rygbi Cymru instead of the United Rugby Championship (URC).\n\nThe council statement said: \"Council representatives left the (22 January) meeting with a clear understanding that the basis of the WRU's and Y11's proposals for the future, if the acquisition of Cardiff Rugby by Y11 is completed, was that the Ospreys would not continue as a professional regional team after 2026-27.\n\n\"The council expressed deep frustration that, despite extensive and recent discussions about the redevelopment of St Helen's, it had not been informed earlier of these proposals. This lack of transparency and engagement is wholly unacceptable.\"\n\nThe council claim that the WRU's restructuring proposals would breach UK competition law and has issued pre-action letters to the WRU and Y11 requesting that they pause their plans.\n\nThe WRU has proposed cutting one of its four men's professional sides - Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets - to three.\n\nThe WRU has stated there will be one licence in Cardiff, one in the west and one in the east, with Llanelli-based Scarlets, and Dragons in Newport, expected to be handed those.\n\nOspreys fans ramp up protest against WRU and Y11\n\nWRU accused of 'malicious cultural vandalism'\n\nWelsh rugby crisis - Who, what, why and where next?\n\nOspreys will continue playing in the URC and Europe next season, but their future beyond the end of the 2026-27 campaign looks even \n\nThere has been ongoing uncertainty around what will happen with the £5m development St Helen's ground in Swansea, that was set to be the Ospreys' new home from the start of next season.\n\nSwansea Council, which is funding the project, said its legal action would be aimed at safeguarding the future of regional rugby in the city.\n\nIn its pre-action legal letter, Swansea Council said the decision to cut the number of regions was \"a restriction of competition and has not been carried out in a fair, transparent or non-discriminatory way\".\n\nIt also said that the WRU's ownership of Cardiff created a \"clear conflict of interest\".\n\nThe council has asked for a response to its pre-action letter by 13 February.\n\n\"Coming out of the meeting we were clear on what we were told, we felt the public had a right to understand what the conclusion of that meeting meant,\" said Rob Stewart, leader of Swansea council told BBC Wales.\n\n\"We've respected parts of the meeting, but there are some clear themes around the fact the decisions seems to have been made to end regional rugby here in Swansea.\n\n\"We felt the public of Swansea deserved to know what the proposals were.\n\n\"There was not an agreement to all parts of the minutes between the Ospreys and the WRU.\n\n\"So we felt it better to put out a statement that was not challengeable in terms of legal aspects, rather focus on the main themes and conclusions, which are not in doubt.\n\n\"We're continuing to support the Ospreys, to continue seeing them play regional rugby here in Swansea, but that does mean having a legal challenge towards the WRU and Y11.\"\n\nWhen asked whether a legal challenge was the best use of public money, Stewart said: \"For our region here, there's in excess of £12m of direct impact to the economy... All of that is at risk so it is in the public interest, and as a public body we have to stand up for what's right.\n\n\"We will continue to fight on behalf of the people of Swansea.\"\n\nThe WRU said: \"We can confirm that we have received a pre-action letter from Swansea Council, alongside a public statement which is inaccurate in reference to a recent meeting we attended.\n\n\"As you will understand we will be taking our own advice and so cannot comment on this at this time.\n\n\"This WRU board has worked in good faith since it took office some two years ago to create a new way forward for Welsh rugby given the significant financial and performance issues we are all facing.\n\n\"We appreciate that these are difficult issues for everyone concerned, but we have conducted ourselves with future long term success in mind.\"\n\nOspreys say they noted the statement from Swansea Council regarding discussions on the future of regional rugby in Wales.\n\nThe Ospreys statement said: \"As has been stated previously, Ospreys continues to operate as a professional club and is focused on supporting its players, staff, and supporters while competing in the URC under existing agreements.\n\n\"No decisions have been made regarding Ospreys' future after the 2026-27 season, and no statements have been made by Lance Bradley or anyone else associated with Ospreys which contradict that.\n\n\"Given the sensitivity of these matters, and the fact that they involve multiple parties and ongoing discussions, it would be inappropriate for Ospreys Rugby to comment on interpretations of meetings, unfinalised proposals, or legal correspondence.\n\n\"Ospreys Rugby remains committed to constructive engagement with all stakeholders and will communicate directly and transparently when there is confirmed information to share.\"",

We both know what we need to do,\" Chisora said.\n\n\"I don't want to sell this fight with violence, because there's too much violence in the world right now.\"\n\nChisora admitted the mood will switch in fight week, but also said he might go on holiday to Alabama, where Wilder lives, with his family after the bout.\n\nThe 42-year-old, who took to the stage draped in a UK flag and bandana, continually described Wilder as his \"brother\", while the American said the fight was \"must-win\" for him.\n\nChisora intends to retire after his 50th contest, while Wilder hopes to make a final run at becoming a two-time heavyweight champion.\n\n\"I need this fight. I need Derek more than he needs me because of what he brings to the table. I feel like I'm back,\" Wilder said.\n\n\"I've been broken down and built back up again. I'm looking forward to it and can't wait.\"\n\nThe heavyweight bout will intrigue the boxing public and is likely to draw a sellout crowd to the O2 as only the second time Wilder will fight in the UK, but will compete with two other shows for attention that weekend in the country.\n\nLauren Price defends her welterweight world title in Cardiff on the same night, before Caroline Dubois and Terri Harper contest a lightweight unification bout in London on 5 April.\n\nWilder, 40, stands at a career crossroads with four losses in his past six bouts.\n\nSuccessive defeats by Joseph Parker and then Zhilei Zhang prompted a year-long lay-off from the sport.\n\nWilder said he attended therapy during that period because of \"problems outside the ring\" and felt he was \"mentally done for\" preparing for his recent fights.\n\nHe returned in June last year to knock out the unheralded Tyrrell Anthony Herndon in seven rounds and could secure a world title fight with a win over Chisora.\n\n\"You want to fight Oleksandr Usyk, I am the gatekeeper,\" Chisora said.\n\nChisora intends to bring the curtain down on a professional career that has spanned 19 years and 346 rounds.\n\nIt is not the first time the two-time world title challenger has branded a fight as his swansong, but when promoter Frank Warren suggested there could be another bout in him if he wins, Chisora interrupted, saying: \"I am, please, please, please.\"\n\nThe first face-off passed without incident, Wilder and Chisora holding more of a conversation for a minute than a stare-down, before the Bronze Bomber brought proceedings to a close by shouting his catch phrase: \"Bomb squad.\"\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Seven years after they lifted a sixth Lombardi Trophy, the New England Patriots have come roaring back to relevance to make Super Bowl 60, and the rest of the NFL is nervous.\n\nFor two decades Tom Brady and Bill Belichick mercilessly terrorised the league year after year, winning those six Super Bowl titles from nine appearances in an era of unrivalled dominance.\n\nFinally relief came, as Brady departed, Belichick followed and the dynasty crumbled into obscurity as four-win also-rans with seemingly no way back.\n\nBut then, a meteoric return to the top this season, powered by head coach Mike Vrabel and quarterback Drake Maye, has plenty of NFL fans backing the Seattle Seahawks at Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara on Sunday, doing so out of pure fear at the thought of the league's 'evil empire' rising again.\n\nBill Belichick: A Super Bowl god's fall from grace\n\nBelichick's Hall of Fame exclusion 'ridiculous'\n\nIn a league built to promote parity, the Patriots continually found ways to win - missing the play-offs just twice during Brady and Belichick's 19 seasons together, and one of those the legendary quarterback missed through injury.\n\nThere were 18 divisional titles, 13 Conference Championship appearances leading to nine Super Bowls and Lombardis - a definition of dominance that still has NFL fans suffering with PTSD (Patriots Traumatic Stress Disorder).\n\nBelichick masterminded a top-10 defence 16 times and Brady led a top-eight offence for 14 straight years, including one of the best in history in 2007 that came up a Super Bowl short of a 19-0 perfect season.\n\nA snarling, hooded Belichick was all business all the time and slipped into the villain role with ease, so some NFL fans rejoiced when Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs came to the rescue, playing the role of Luke Skywalker and the rebel alliance to help defeat the evil Patriot empire.\n\nAnd that looked like it would be that as Belichick struggled without Brady. A rare first-round pick spent on Mac Jones in 2021 proved a false dawn as the Pats made the play-offs but were thrashed by Josh Allen's Buffalo.\n\nA 4-13 season saw the end of Belichick's tenure, and former Pats linebacker Jerod Mayo could only produce the same 4-13 finish that ended his stint after just one season.\n\nThree straight years without the play-offs was the team's longest run since the early 1990s, and in the final two they were not even close - ranking near the bottom of the league in almost every metric.\n\nOwner Robert Kraft turned to another former Patriots linebacker, but one with vital head coaching experience in Mike Vrabel, and he has led a record 10-win turnaround that has the Patriots back on their perch.\n\nAnd the rest of the NFL fearing that the empire could be about to strike back.\n\nKraft deserves credit for acting quickly and switching head coaches as Vrabel looked the perfect fit.\n\nSteeped in the 'Patriot way' of doing things, the three-time Super Bowl winner knows how to get he job done but, unlike Mayo, he had the crucial experience of leading the Tennessee Titans to the AFC Championship game during his spell in Nashville.\n\nVrabel was the most wanted head coach of the cycle last year and Maye has shown flashes during his rookie year that he had franchise quarterback potential. The two have proven to be a match made in heaven.\n\nA head coach who built on fierce defence, and a second-year quarterback with a knack for producing the right plays at the right time - that's just one of the similarities with the 2001 Patriots, the first Super Bowl win of the Brady-Belichick era.\n\nThe combination was promising enough for Kraft to sanction the biggest outlay in the league in free agency, with $364m splashed out on new talent - and crucially most of them have been hits.\n\nCoupled with some seriously good drafting, the new head coach and improving sophomore quarterback have landed in a perfect storm in a total Patriots reboot - with just 16 players left in the squad from a couple of years ago.\n\nThey had the second-most snaps played by rookies this season and a total of 416 regular season games by players in their first year in Foxborough - a record for a team reaching a Super Bowl.\n\nPerhaps Vrabel being new as well has helped so many new faces all knit together, but however it worked it's certainly been a recipe for success as they've all delivered.\n\nThe team's leading receiver Stefon Diggs, top tackler and defensive play-caller Robert Spillane, top sack leader Harold Landry and defensive giant Milton Williams all arrived in free agency last summer.\n\nTheir regular season rushing leader TreVeyon Henderson came out of the 2025 NFL Draft and the Patriots will be the first team ever to start two rookies on the offensive line in Will Campbell and Marcus Bryant.\n\nIt's been as clinical in the Patriots front office as it has on the field, and it has New England one game away from a record seventh Super Bowl title.\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'\n\nFor those who had their Super Bowl dreams dashed by the Patriots in the past, there are some uneasy similarities with how Vrabel and Maye have emulated the Brady and Belichick axis.\n\nAt just 23, Maye could become the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl so he's younger than Brady was, but both have made the big game in their second season.\n\nMaye is just the third quarterback to make the Super Bowl after generating under 17 points on offence in multiple play-off games - Brady's 2001 Pats offence failed to put 17 on the board in all three games.\n\nWeather played a part in all three play-off games but Vrabel's defence was still excellent and coming through such tight encounters like that in the post-season is exactly how Brady and Belichick made their names.\n\nIn fact, New England's win over Denver was just the fourth time since 2001 that a quarterback generated 14 points or fewer on offence and still won a Championship game or Super Bowl - Brady was part of the other three.\n\nMaye spreads the ball out like Brady used to, with nine players this season having at least 200 receiving yards, and often pops up with the crucial play at the crucial time, albeit more with his legs than his arm.\n\nOf Maye's 16 runs in the play-offs, 12 have gone for a touchdown or first down - Brady had the same kind of magic in his arm to lead his team's to glory.\n\nSo a tough, defensive coach, a talented, focused quarterback happy to win any way possible, some key drafting and expert free agent pick-ups have resulted in a team able to blow teams away or grind out tough play-off wins home and away.\n\nThat sure sounds familiar, and it will be a familiar sight in Santa Clara as the Patriots will have appeared in 20% of all Super Bowls come Sunday - and the concern for the rest of the NFL is that this could be just the start.\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nThe road to Super Bowl 60 - how Patriots and Seahawks got there",

    "description": "George Clinton, while working as a barber, recruited him. Mr. Nelson went on to name the group and, with his bandmates, to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.",
    "fullText": "Billy Bass Nelson, who turned a part-time job sweeping floors for a New Jersey barber named George Clinton into a gig as the first bassist for Funkadelic, Mr. Clinton’s groundbreaking band that melded R&B, funk and acid rock into a groovalicious exploration of the furthest reaches of the musical universe, died on Saturday. He was 75.\n\nHis death was announced by the Facebook page for George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic, which did not provide a location or cause. Mr. Nelson had been in hospice care. Some news outlets and other sources erroneously reported last week that he had died.\n\nFunkadelic, which eventually merged with its sibling band the Parliaments, represented an enormous leap forward in the fusion of musical styles taking place in the late 1960s and ’70s. What began with Mr. Nelson and two other musicians grew into a sprawling, rotating lineup of artists whose joyfully riotous music was matched by extravagant, drug-fueled live shows.\n\nMr. Nelson was among the 16 members of the Parliament-Funkadelic collective — or P-Funk — who were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nMr. Nelson began as the bassist in the backup band for the Parliaments, Mr. Clinton’s doo-wop quintet that entertained audiences across New Jersey in the late 1950s and ’60s. To play guitar, he recruited his friend Eddie Hazel, who also went on to star in various P-Funk lineups.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Clinton, who was later known for his outlandish onstage clothing choices — including no clothing at all — wore dinner jackets and had his hair straightened. Mr. Nelson, a decade younger, was \n\nTired of being in a nameless backup band, in 1967 Mr. Nelson came up with Funkadelic, drawing on the two genres that he was trying to meld: funk and psychedelic rock.\n\nThe balance of power between the crooners and the funksters in the group shifted in 1968, after a dispute with Motown, the Parliaments’ record label, prevented them from using the name the Parliaments, or simply Parliament, for several years.\n\nThe pragmatic Mr. Clinton, seeing the way the cultural tide was shifting, hung up his dinner jacket and embraced the new direction Mr. Nelson was charting.\n\nMr. Nelson’s influence is all over Funkadelic’s first three albums, “Funkadelic” (1970), “Free Your Mind … and Your Ass Will Follow” (1970) and “Maggot Brain” (1971). He co-wrote and sang on several tracks, including “Super Stupid,” one of the band’s first signature tracks, from the album “Maggot Brain.”\n\nHe also embraced Mr. Clinton’s no-limits approach to live performances. Tired of being considered the baby of the group — he was the youngest — Mr. Nelson devised an oversize diaper to wear onstage, a look that several bandmates later adopted.\n\n“I had these long braids, bare chested, the diaper and my combat boots,” he told LA Weekly in 1996. “And sometimes I had a tuxedo jacket and tails to go with it.”\n\nFollowing a financial dispute with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Nelson left the band soon after “Maggot Brain” was released. He then played backup for a number of other groups, most extensively the Temptations; his playing featured prominently in their last major hit, “Shakey Ground” (1975). He also occasionally rejoined Mr. Clinton, though the two never fully resolved their differences.\n\n“I’ll get the platinum and gold records if I get a chance,” Mr. Nelson told The Courier-News of Bridgewater, N.J., in 1997, following his induction into the Hall of Fame. “And I don’t need George. I could do it without George.”\n\nWilliam Nelson Jr. was born on Jan. 26, 1951, in Plainfield, N.J., to William and Cora Nelson.\n\nLike many neighborhood teens, he hung out at the local barbershop, where Mr. Clinton cut hair while trying to get the Parliaments off the ground. During practice sessions, Mr. Clinton recruited Mr. Nelson and other teenagers to play backup after several older musicians were drafted into the U.S. Army.\n\nMr. Clinton eventually signed a contract with Motown, but when the company declined to record the Parliaments, he signed with another label, Revilot, and produced what became the group’s first hit, “(I Wanna) Testify” (1967).\n\nThe Parliaments went on tour, taking along their young backup band, which now included Mr. Hazel, the guitarist Tawl Ross and the drummer Tiki Fulwood.\n\nFor a time, Funkadelic became something of an alter ego for the Parliaments; the same roster would perform under one name or the other, depending on the style of music being played.\n\n“We took the rhythm and blues and the funk that was already there, and we took it to another level,” Mr. Nelson said in the 2016 documentary “Tear the Roof Off: The Untold Story of Parliament Funkadelic.”\n\nMr. Clinton recovered the right to the Parliament name in 1974. He began to use the two names interchangeably, or in tandem, as Parliament-Funkadelic, or P-Funk for short. He also spun off a variety of subsidiary acts, like the female duo the Brides of Funkenstein.\n\nMr. Nelson returned in 1975 to play on Funkadelic’s song “Better by the Pound,” and in the 1990s to play live shows with the P-Funk All-Stars, which had evolved from the original band, though only Mr. Clinton remained from the original lineup.\n\nMr. Nelson also played bass for a number of R&B acts, including the Commodores, Lionel Richie and the ska-punk band Fishbone.\n\nAfter a brief hiatus to work as a computer operator, he released a solo album, “Out of the Dark,” under the name O.G. Funk, in 1994.\n\nMr. Nelson’s survivors include his daughter, Ebony Nelson, and his sister, Alise Nelson.\n\nLong after he left Funkadelic, Mr. Nelson continued to have strong ideas about the proper way to play funk.\n\n“Funk is meant to be played at a very specific tempo,” he told Guitar Player magazine in 1996. “A lot of groups play ‘funk’ licks and do ‘funk’ things, like thumbing the bass and all, but they play it all too fast. If you want to play that raw, serious funk, you have to slow it down.”",

    "fullText": "International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry says it must \"be better\" on climate change after receiving a petition signed by more than 21,000 people who want to stop fossil fuel companies from sponsoring winter sports.\n\nThe petition - delivered on Wednesday and with athletes among the signatories - comes as Italy's Eni, one of the world's seven biggest oil companies, is a 'premium partner' of the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nIt follows reports that the number of countries which could reliably host a Winter Olympics will hugely reduce in the future because of climate change.\n\nAsked by the BBC whether she is disappointed by the Games having high-carbon sponsors, Coventry said: \"It's really nice athletes have a platform to speak up.\n\n\"The petition, I know they met with our team today and we are having conversations in order to be better, and for our stakeholders to be better. But that takes time.\"\n\nChristophe Dubi, the IOC executive director for the Olympic Games, added: \"We make a point to receive those petitions, and we have to recognise climate is a challenge for all of us.\n\n\"What we have to do as an organisation is to be at the forefront of sustainability, and our principles are very clear.\"\n\nOne area the IOC is aiming to make the Olympics more sustainable is having Games take place over a wider area with more pre-existing facilities, and Coventry said Milan-Cortina is an acid test for whether this is a viable future.\n\nMilan-Cortina takes place in three hubs spread across northern Italy - in Milan, Cortina and Livigno - with only two newly built sporting facilities: the Santagiulia ice hockey arena and Cortina Sliding Centre.\n\nThe next two Winter Olympics - French Alps 2030 and Utah 2034 - will also have sports spread more widely, while the 2032 Summer Olympics in Brisbane is will have venues across Queensland.\n\nThis has caused issues however, with Brisbane organisers saying, external they will go beyond the originally stated budget of $4.9bn (£3.6bn).\n\n\"We are really experiencing a spread out Games here for the first time - we are going to learn a lot,\" Coventry said.\n\n\"We have taken this decision for sustainability reasons, climate and not having to have new venues. We are seeing there is an impact on National Olympic Committees because of the spreadness [sic], also for broadcast and media, making it harder to get around.\n\n\"What is really cool is that you get to see iconic venues in beautiful places - but now we have to weigh this up, the balance between a spread games for sustainability reasons but not shifting complexity and sustainability to different areas.\"\n\nWhile the action got underway on Wednesday with the start of the curling events, the 2026 Winter Olympics will officially start with the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nCoventry said she hoped all nations would be treated with respect by spectators, including the USA team amid criticism from Italian authorities about the presence of ICE agents in Milan.\n\n\"I hope the opening ceremony is seen by everyone as a chance to be respectful,\" she said.\n\n\"For me, when we went to the Olympic village that is the best reminder of how the Games should be. I hope the opening ceremony will do that.\"\n\nFear and Hall named 2026 Team GB flagbearers\n\nRussian athletes linked to pro-war activity\n\nQuiz: Name every sport at the 2026 Winter Olympics",

You could tell because there's a whole bunch of software companies whose stock prices are under a lot of pressure because somehow AI is going to replace them. It is the most illogical thing in the world and time will prove itself.\"\n\nHuang outlined his view that software is a tool for AI to use, rather than replace, explaining that AI will use the tools software offers rather than reinventing its own.\n\nThe CEO named Service Now, SAP, Cadence, and Synopsis, specifically as bright spots in the space.\n\nRecent weakness in the software sector comes amid a broader market rotation away from tech.

    "fullText": "Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola wants the English Football League to change their rules to allow Marc Guehi to play in the Carabao Cup final against Arsenal.\n\nGuehi was ineligible to play as City completed a 5-1 aggregate victory over Newcastle in Wednesday's semi-final second leg and is also set to miss out when they take on the Gunners on 22 March at Wembley.\n\nCity signed the 25-year-old England centre-back from Crystal Palace after their 2-0 first leg win over the Magpies.\n\nHowever, competition rules dictate that he had to have joined them \"prior to the closure of the Winter transfer window, or the first leg of the semi-final (whichever is sooner)\" to be eligible to play.\n\n\"Hopefully we can convince the Carabao Cup that Marc [Guehi] can play the final. I don't understand why he cannot play the final,\" Guardiola said.\n\n\"You buy a player for a lot of money and he is not able to play for a rule I don't understand. Hopefully they can change it,\" he added.\n\nCity's other January signing, winger Antoine Semenyo, arrived at the club from Bournemouth four days prior to their trip to the north east for the first leg against Newcastle, in which he scored.\n\n\"Antoine arrived before the first [game] so could play. And now it's the final. Why should he [Guehi] not play? Why not? We pay his salary, he is our player,\" Guardiola added.\n\n\"I said to the club, they have to ask, definitely. I don't understand the reason why he cannot play in the final in March, when I have been here for a long time.\n\n\"The rules to buy a player depends on Fifa, Uefa, the Premier League who say, OK the transfer window is open, when you buy a player you have to play, no? It's logic. Of course we are going to try to ask [for] him to play. Pure logic.\n\nAsked what he thought the answer will be from the EFL, City's Spanish boss, added: \"No. But we will try.\"\n\nCity have already benefited from one rule change this season that allowed players to play for two teams in the same competition, instead of being cup tied.\n\nThat allowed Semenyo and Max Alleyne to feature in the semi-final matches, despite appearing for Bournemouth and Watford respectively in previous rounds.\n\nInside Man City's rebuild and plan for life without Guardiola\n\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man City - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Consistency is the next step for Rangers winger Mikey Moore after a standout performance against Kilmarnock, says head coach Danny Rohl.",
    "fullText": "\"He's been the best player on the pitch.\"\n\nOn the night Andreas Skov Olsen netted his first Rangers goal, scoring in a win that took the Ibrox side to within three points of the Scottish Premiership summit, it was the winger on the opposite flank who staked his claim to become a guaranteed starter in Danny Rohl's side.\n\nIn the aftermath of Sunday's goalless draw at Hibernian, Rangers' lack of creativity from open play came into focus again.\n\nTeenage Mikey Moore, signed on loan from Tottenham Hotspur in the summer, was the only bright spark in Rohl's attack during a blunt display in Leith.\n\nIt was a cameo that had sections of the Rangers support questioning why the 18-year-old had not started, but he was presented that opportunity against Kilmarnock three days later.\n\nWithin three minutes, the teenager had perfectly threaded a pass through for Djeidi Gassama to win a spot-kick, resulting in an early red card for the visitors and a goal from captain James Tavernier.\n\nTerrorising the Kilmarnock defence throughout, the Spurs youngster then registered a second-half assist for Skov Olsen before capping off a sublime performance with a goal that proved to be the final kick of a thumping 5-1 win.\n\n\"It's what he deserves,\" former Rangers striker Steven Naismith said after Moore's left-foot strike hit the far corner.\n\nWatch: Rangers v Kilmarnock Sportscene highlights\n\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app\n\nA goal, an assist and five chances created.\n\nThat alone tells the story of a busy night for Moore, whose midweek appearance at Ibrox was just his 13th league start of the season.\n\nThe forward is building a promising relationship on the Rangers left with full-back Jayden Meghoma, while Rohl can also be encouraged with how he combined with winter signings Skov Olsen and Tuur Rommens during their exciting cameos.\n\nHowever, former Rangers forward Rory Loy was particularly impressed with the youngster's movement.\n\nDriving to the byeline, jinking in off the left, and also finding himself space in central areas, Loy described Moore's movement as \"nothing short of sensational\".\n\nSpeaking on BBC Sportsound, he added: \"Two or three passes before he gets the ball, defenders don't know where he is.\n\n\"It's been a masterclass in how to receive the ball in tight areas. He can go both ways, which keeps defenders guessing.\"\n\nFellow BBC Scotland pundit Naismith added: \"He's so direct, he's confident, he's going at [the Kilmarnock defence] and he's enjoying himself out there.\"\n\nMoore's team-mates created just seven chances between them at Hibs on Sunday.\n\nHe registered five alone on Wednesday, while his seven dribbles were also higher than any other player.\n\nGame state has to come into that, of course. At the weekend, Rangers were playing against 11 men, away to a top-six side. Struggling Kilmarnock were a man and a goal down after a few minutes on Wednesday.\n\nA goal-scoring performance from the England youth international in the Old Firm derby win at Celtic last month looked set to ignite his Ibrox career, but seven games without a goal contribution followed.\n\nDespite that, the Ibrox side just appear a livelier and more unpredictable proposition with Moore in the line-up.\n\nA mid-season injury and squad rotation has meant Moore has failed to feature in 12 of Rangers' 25 league matches, but Rohl is now demanding consistency as his side attempt to reel Hearts in.\n\n\"We know Mikey, that should be the level for him again and again,\" the Rangers head coach told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"This is the next step for him, consistency. But I will not speak about individual performances, it's about the team.\"",

    "fullText": "Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds overcame a power cut and the loss of the first end to get Team GB's Winter Olympics off to a winning start in the mixed doubles curling against Norway.\n\nThe Scottish duo, who are considered serious medal contenders in this event, cut relaxed figures inside the quirky, partially-wooden Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium in Italy, which was built for the 1956 Games.\n\nEven the loss of light in parts of the venue during an ugly opening end didn't discomfit last year's world silver medallists, who took three in the second end and would never trail again in the first of their nine round-robin matches.\n\nMouat and Dodds ultimately won 8-6 to right the wrongs of the 2022 semi-final, in which they spurned a lead to lose to the Norwegian pair before going on to be beaten by Sweden in the bronze-medal match.\n\nAnd it sets them up nicely for Thursday's ties against Estonia (09:05 GMT) and the Czechs (18:05) - both of whom lost their openers - live across the BBC.\n\nWinter Olympics day-by-day guide\n\n'Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower'\n\nThe pounding music and disco lights lent a sense of occasion to the first action of this year's Games in the high-end Italian resort of Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nThe snow which had hammered down all day in the Dolomites had turned to sleet by the time the four matches started in front of a healthy crowd inside the 3,500-capacity arena.\n\nBut many of those spectators were cast into darkness for four or five minutes early on until someone put some change in the meter, the scoring screens flickered back into life and play resumed.\n\n\"I didn't mind the lights going off,\" said Mouat. \"It was a bit of a boogie, a rave... it was like a nightclub.\"\n\nWhen the dancing stopped, Norway's husband and wife team of Magnus Nedregotten and Kristin Skaslien initially took control before the sides fell into a cagey contest.\n\nMouat and Dodds seized the initiative in a splendid second end - the final accounting reached after some lengthy deliberation with the measuring stick - and led 4-3 at the break after edging a tight fourth against the 2002 silver medallists.\n\nThe interval did check the momentum of the childhood friends a little, as Norway - who also won bronze in 2018 - drew level again.\n\nNedregotten's flawless play was keeping Norway in it - wife Skaslien's struggles threatening a little domestic disharmony - but even his efforts could not prevent Team GB snatching three in the sixth end thanks to a stunning Dodds throw.\n\nThat opened a three-shot lead with two ends to play.\n\nAnd, although the Norwegians invoked the powerplay to cut the deficit to one, Mouat and Dodds did likewise in the last end to close out a statement 8-6 win.\n\n\"It took us a bit of time to work out one end was curling more than the other, but once we did we took a step up in performance and took control from there,\" Dodds said.\n\n\"It's a good confidence builder to start the week.\"",

That's how one woman described the storm she's living through—financial, emotional, and structural—after discovering her husband was secretly funneling his \"fun money\" into conversations with a woman behind bars.\n\nThe story unraveled during a recent episode of \"The Ramsey Show,\" where co-hosts Rachel Cruze and George Kamel took a call from a woman named Caroline.

While he initially claimed he was \"trapped,\" Kamel pushed back hard: \"No, he wasn't trapped. He was willfully doing this on his own volition.\"\n\nCruze confirmed the obvious question: yes, it was the same incarcerated woman the entire time. The money, Caroline later learned, was used to fund commissary accounts or similar prison expenses.\n\n\"He just got caught up in it,\" she said. \"But he never told me—he just kept hiding it.\"\n\nAnd for Caroline, the emotional betrayal wasn't the only wreckage to deal with. Shortly after uncovering the truth, a tree fell on their home. \"So we were dealing with a hole in our marriage and a hole in our house,\" she said.

    "title": "Trump may have shot himself in the foot at the Fed, as Powell could stay on while Miran resigns from White House post",
    "description": "The Democrat roadblock was expected but “raises the prospect of Chair Powell staying on as FOMC chair (not Board of Governors chair) beyond May,” noted UBS.",
    "fullText": "President Trump’s plans for a more receptive Fed may have backfired so spectacularly that Jerome Powell may end up staying as chairman beyond the end of his term, while Stephen Miran, Trump’s most loyal supporter on the bank’s rate-setting committee, leaves the institution. \n\nTrump has repeatedly taken aim at the chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve—often via personal insults—since launching his presidential bid. First, he wanted Powell to hold interest rates higher to avoid boosting President Biden’s ratings on the economy. After he won the Oval Office, he began lobbying for lower rates and has gone to unusual lengths to shape monetary policy, including multiple legal threats.\n\nLast week, he achieved a key aim: finding a replacement for Powell (whose term as Fed chair ends in May) who is suitably dovish, but isn’t seen as so close to the White House that it would spook markets.\n\nWhat criminal investigations involve Fed officials currently?\n\nWhy are Democrats blocking Kevin Warsh's Fed nomination?\n\nWhy did Stephen Miran resign from CEA?\n\nHow might Powell stay beyond his May term?\n\nKevin Warsh, a former Fed governor under Ben Bernanke, didn’t upset markets beyond potentially adding to the decline in precious metal prices with his hawkish tone on the central bank’s balance sheet. But Warsh may not shape the tone of conversations on the base-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) as quickly as Trump might have hoped.\n\nThat’s because Warsh has to get through Senate Banking Committee hearings before being approved, and Democrats on the panel are refusing to proceed until criminal proceedings brought by the Trump administration against Fed members have been dropped.\n\n“We demand that you delay any nomination proceedings for Mr. Warsh until after the pretextual criminal investigations involving Chair Powell and Governor [Lisa] Cook have been closed,” banking committee Democrats said in a statement.\n\nCurrently, two members of the FOMC are facing court action: Powell himself and Fed Governor Cook. So far, the U.S. Supreme Court has barred President Trump’s September attempt to remove Cook from her post on the basis of claims that she had fraudulently secured favorable mortgage terms before she joined the Fed. Cook denies the allegations.\n\nEarlier this month, Powell also confirmed he was under criminal investigation by the Department of Justice over testimony he gave to a Senate committee about renovations to Federal Reserve buildings. The renovation costs have been a point of debate between Trump and Powell, and the duo argued in July (in front of the world media) over whether the budget had been exceeded.\n\nThe Democrats added: “The [Warsh] nomination comes after months of repeated efforts by President Trump and his administration to influence the Fed by intimidation, including by opening criminal investigations into Fed Governor Cook and Fed Chair Powell. These ongoing efforts by the president to control the Fed—which must be able to exercise independent judgment—undermine public confidence in any nomination for chair at this time.”",

    "description": "Bitcoin sank after Treasury Secretary Bessent said banks would not bail out crypto.",
    "fullText": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell 2% on Wednesday to around $73,000 per token after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the US government would not bail out the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn a heated back-and-forth during a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Bessent was asked if the US Treasury had the authority to buy bitcoin or other cryptos.\n\n\"I do not have the authority to do that, and as chair of FSOC, I do not have that authority,\" Bessent stated.\n\nThe decline on Wednesday was also fueled by the broader selling pressure in markets and a warning from notable investor Michael Burry that a sustained decline in bitcoin's price could \"set in motion a death spiral leading to massive value destruction.\"\n\n\"Bitcoin has been exposed as a purely speculative asset, and is not near the debasement trade hedge that gold and other precious metals are,\" Burry, who rose to prominence after predicting the 2008 financial crisis, wrote in his Substack.\n\nThe move lower only added to bitcoin's recent rout. The world's largest cryptocurrency is down 13% over the past five days.\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency dropped sharply last weekend, touching its lowest levels since last April and notching a fourth straight month of losses.\n\nThe move lower coincided with President Trump's announcement on Friday selecting Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve when Jerome Powell's term ends in May, a nomination markets view as hawkish.\n\nWhat are analysts saying about Bitcoin's support levels?\n\nHow has Bitcoin performed over recent months?\n\nWhat is Michael Burry's warning about Bitcoin's decline?\n\nWhy did Bitcoin drop after Treasury Secretary Bessent's comments?\n\nEther (ETH-USD) and other digital tokens also slid.\n\nWith bitcoin's next support level at $73,000, \"current flows suggest sentiment has shifted meaningfully,\" 10X Research strategists wrote in a recent note.\n\nThe firm's strategists pointed to flow and positioning data, which indicated \"investors are not yet positioned to buy the dip.\"\n\n\"While sentiment and technical indicators are approaching extreme levels, the broader downtrend remains intact,\" the researchers wrote. \"In the absence of a clear catalyst, there is little urgency to step in.\"\n\nThe firm noted that traders remain focused on deleveraging and unwinding their positions rather than on preparing for a typical snapback rally.\n\nPressure on digital assets reflected the broader fragility across the crypto market. Aside from a brief bounce last month, bitcoin has struggled since October, when whale selling and forced liquidations swept through the industry.",

    "fullText": "The downturn in the pizza restaurant sector is continuing into 2026 with major dining chains closing hundreds of locations, making it more difficult for consumers to get their favorite meal.\n\nPizza restaurants have faced severe economic headwinds over the last two years, as several chains have dealt with fierce competition, rising labor and food costs, and high lease rates requiring several companies to launch out-of-court restructurings, close locations, and in some cases, file for bankruptcy.\n\nSeattle-based Mod Pizza operated about 500 locations in 2024, but economic challenges forced it to close 27 units and sell its assets to Chatsworth, Calif.-based Elite Restaurant Group.\n\nThe restaurant chain did not solve its economic problems and has continued closing locations, as its website lists 448 units as of Feb. 4.\n\nOther smaller pizza chains filed for bankruptcy in 2025, including Bertucci's Restaurants, which filed for Chapter 11 protection on April 24, 2025, and Backdraughts, filing on July 23, 2025.\n\nMajor pizza restaurant franchisees also had financial difficulty last year and filed for bankruptcy protection, including Domino’s operator People First Pizza Inc., which filed Chapter 11 on March 26, 2025, and Little Caesars franchisee Red Door Pizza LLC, which filed its petition on July 15, 2025.\n\nDomino's holds the title of largest pizza chain in the U.S. with about 7,090 units through the third quarter of 2025, according to the \"Domino's 101: Fun facts\" on the company's website.\n\nLittle Caesars claims to be the third-largest pizza chain in the U.S., but doesn't list its total locations. The chain appears to have over 4,200 in the U.S., according to LocationsCloud.\n\nPizza Hut claims to operate over 6,700 locations in the U.S., according to its website, but the chain will soon be shrinking.\n\nGiant pizza dining chain Pizza Hut said it will close 250 underperforming restaurant locations as part of its Hut Forward plan in the first half of 2026, after reporting a 1% same-store sales decline globally in the fourth quarter and for the year in 2025, parent Yum! Brands' Chief Financial Officer Ranjith Roy said in the company's Q4 2025 earnings call Feb. 4.\n\nThe company, however, reported a 1% increase in same-store sales for Pizza Hut International, with strength in the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia.\n\nThe Hut Forward program consists of a vibrant marketing program, which includes a one-time Yum! marketing support contribution, modernization of certain technology and franchise agreements, and targeted closures of underperforming units, Roy said in the earnings call.",

    "description": "Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar, say they will not release billions in rebuilding aid until Hamas disarms and enforceable security guarantees are in place. The metal gates of the Rafah crossing swung open Monday morning for the first time in nearly two years.",
    "fullText": "Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar, say they will not release billions in rebuilding aid until Hamas disarms and enforceable security guarantees are in place.\n\nThe metal gates of the Rafah crossing swung open Monday morning for the first time in nearly two years. But just five medical patients and their companions, along with just over a dozen others who made it through that first day, were a stark illustration of how far the Gaza ceasefire remains from delivering on its promises.\n\nFamilies camped overnight in the cold outside the crossing, waiting through hours-long Israeli and Egyptian biometric security screenings.\n\nAmbulances lined up on both sides of the border, shuttling critical medical cases through checkpoints where European Union monitors supervised the processing. On the Egyptian side, aid staging areas sat empty. Humanitarian workers described confusion about coordination and next steps.\n\nThe slow processing and stringent security protocols reflect broader tensions. But the real battle isn't about border crossings. It's about weapons.\n\nPresident Donald Trump insists Hamas will disarm \"because they have no choice.\" His special envoy,Steve Witkoff, says the group \"will give up their AK-47s.\" Senior Hamas officials say that the conversation never happened.\n\n“Our priority has always been stopping the war and protecting civilians, not negotiating away weapons,” senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzook told Al Jazeera last week. US proposals ranging from freezing arms to full disarmament were discussed in theory, he said, but never became part of formal negotiations.\n\nThat disconnect now hangs over everything labeled “phase two”: reconstruction, governance, and long-term security. Phase two effectively came into focus last week with the return of the final Israeli hostage’s remains. What happens next, however, is still unclear.\n\nNo international force has been deployed to Gaza to collect or verify weapons. No mechanism exists to enforce disarmament. More than two dozen countries participate in coordination meetings about Gaza's future. None has committed troops.\n\n\"Phase Two has been announced, but in reality, it has not begun because Hamas rejects several core elements, and no one is forcing compliance,\" Edmund Fitton-Brown, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who previously coordinated the UN Security Council's monitoring team for Islamic State and al-Qaeda, told The Media Line. \"The announcement was premature. It reflected diplomatic optimism rather than facts on the ground.\"\n\n“Israel cannot demilitarize Hamas on its own, especially in areas where Israeli forces are no longer present,” Fitton-Brown said. “Enforced disarmament would require a transitional authority backed by an international stabilization force.”\n\n\"Without a monopoly on coercion, there is no government,\" Fitton-Brown said. \"If Hamas retains weapons and organized armed units, it retains power regardless of what administrative structures exist on paper.\"\n\nGetting countries to commit forces has proven impossible. Egypt has ruled out deploying troops inside Gaza. European countries will support governance structures but not provide combat forces. Turkey supports Hamas politically. Gulf states that might fund reconstruction won't commit forces.\n\n\"Many countries want their flag present but not their soldiers at risk,\" Fitton-Brown said. \"That defeats the purpose.\"\n\nIsrael will not compromise on demilitarization. “The Israeli government has made it very clear that it will not compromise on the demilitarization of Hamas,” Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official and founder of Inside the Middle East, told The Media Line. “This is not only the position of the current government. Any Israeli government would demand the dismantling of Hamas’s military capabilities.”\n\nAt the same time, Melamed said Israel does not expect Hamas to voluntarily disarm. “Nobody has any illusion that Hamas is going to disarm itself,” he said. “Demilitarization is not about removing every weapon. It is mainly about offensive weapons — rockets and advanced arms that can be used against Israeli territory. Israel’s priority is to eliminate Hamas’s ability to manufacture rockets and dismantle its command structure.”\n\nBut even that limited definition creates a practical dilemma. Achieving it would require renewed Israeli military operations, which would undermine the ceasefire, or the deployment of an external force willing to confront Hamas directly. Neither currently exists, short of renewed Israeli military action that would likely collapse the ceasefire.\n\nHamas is pressing to include its roughly 10,000-strong police force in the new governance architecture. According to multiple sources, Hamas has urged its civil and security personnel to cooperate with the US-backed National Committee for the Administration of Gaza while seeking to have its police formally incorporated. Israel has rejected the proposal. The force is inseparable from Hamas's broader security apparatus, Israeli officials argue.\n\nAn internal Hamas document obtained by Israeli broadcaster Kan reveals the group's strategy for maintaining control while appearing to cooperate. The directive tells administrators to maintain normal work routines while prohibiting them from attacking members of the new technocratic government on social media. The key instruction: \"No personal contact should be made, or information and news should be passed to them except through the relevant authority.\" Hamas itself retains control over all communication channels.\n\nIsraeli military intelligence assessments delivered to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warn that Hamas continues deepening its governance structures and taking concrete steps to preserve influence by integrating members into government ministries and the security apparatus, according to Israeli officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"Hamas does not want to openly reject the peace plan because doing so would provoke a decisive response from Washington and potentially from Israel,\" Fitton-Brown said. \"Instead, Hamas signals conditional cooperation while avoiding real compliance.\"\n\nHamas' messaging has been deliberately contradictory. Some figures say openly they will never disarm. Others suggest weapons might be placed in storage, a freeze rather than surrender. That reflected a tactical debate within Hamas, not a genuine willingness to disarm.\n\nHamas officials have blamed ongoing Israeli military operations for blocking the technocratic committee from functioning, arguing the group's priority is enabling the independent national committee to assume responsibilities in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli officials see this as confirmation that Hamas plans to maintain organized armed forces under a new administrative label.\n\nAssessing Hamas' remaining capabilities is difficult. Before October 2023, Israeli and American officials estimated Hamas possessed between 15,000 and 30,000 rockets, along with large stockpiles of small arms, anti-tank weapons, drones, and an extensive tunnel network. Israeli officials now say most capabilities have been destroyed or degraded, but acknowledge Hamas retains residual weapons, substantial underground infrastructure, and organized armed cells capable of limited attacks.\n\n“In the current context, rapid or forced disarmament is unrealistic and would require coordination with Hamas and a gradual process,” Adel al-Ghoul, a Palestinian political analyst and head of the Paris Center for Security Studies and International Relations, told The Media Line.\n\n“The approach most widely discussed internationally is not disarmament by force, but the gradual containment and neutralization of weapons through stronger Palestinian security institutions, improved economic conditions, and incentives for stability over chaos.”\n\nThe crossing reopening offered a glimpse of limited progress. Young men and elderly Palestinians waiting in line spoke of relief mixed with frustration. Glad to see any movement after nearly two years. Angry at how marginal the flows remain.\n\nMeanwhile, on-the-ground recovery proceeds incrementally. The UN Development Program has cleared approximately 50,000 tons of rubble since the ceasefire began in October, including at a new Khan Yunis crushing facility processing roughly 1,000 tons daily. But UN estimates suggest Gaza contains more than 40 million tons of debris that will take years to remove.\n\nBroader reconstruction remains stalled. A postwar redevelopment proposal promoted by Jared Kushner and unveiled at Davos last month envisions up to 100,000 housing units in a rebuilt \"New Rafah,\" along with schools, hospitals, and commercial zones. The plan explicitly conditions large-scale construction on verified Hamas disarmament.\n\nThe United States has not committed funding for large-scale reconstruction. Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar, say they will not release billions in rebuilding aid until Hamas disarms and enforceable security guarantees are in place. Requirements that have not yet been clearly defined or implemented.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes continue across Gaza despite the ceasefire. Health officials say more than 500 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began last October. Israel says the strikes target Hamas military operatives and weapons infrastructure.\n\nDiscussions about deploying international forces continue but remain entirely preliminary. No country has offered concrete troop commitments. The technocratic committee tasked with governing Gaza has been announced but has not yet begun to function in any meaningful way.\n\n“Hamas still maintains social and organizational influence on the ground, even where its military role has declined,” al-Ghoul said. “Any new administration would have to rely on indirect coordination or avoid direct confrontation.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A government lawyer who told a judge that her job “sucks” during a court hearing stemming from the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota has been removed from her Justice Department post, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nJulie Le had been working for the Justice Department on a detail, but the U.S. attorney in Minnesota ended her assignment after her comments in court on Tuesday, the person said. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter. She had been working for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement before the temporary assignment.\n\nAt a hearing Tuesday in St. Paul, Minnesota, for several immigration cases, Le told U.S. District Judge Jerry Blackwell that she wishes he could hold her in contempt of court “so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep.”\n\n“What do you want me to do? The system sucks. This job sucks. And I am trying every breath that I have so that I can get you what you need,” Le said, according to a transcript.\n\nLe's extraordinary remarks reflect the intense strain that has been placed on the federal court system since President Donald Trump returned to the White House a year ago with a promise to carry out mass deportations. ICE officials have said the surge in Minnesota has become its largest-ever immigration operation since ramping up in early January.\n\nSeveral prosecutors have left the U.S. Attorney’s office in Minnesota amid frustration with the immigration enforcement surge and the Justice Department’s response to fatal shootings of two civilians by federal agents. Le was assigned at least 88 cases in less than a month, according to online court records.\n\nBlackwell told Le that the volume of cases isn't an excuse for disregarding court orders. He expressed concern that people arrested in immigration enforcement operations are routinely jailed for days after judges have ordered their release from custody.\n\n“And I hear the concerns about all the energy that this is causing the DOJ to expend, but, with respect, some of it is of your own making by not complying with orders,” the judge told Le.\n\nLe said she was working for the Department of Homeland Security as an ICE attorney in immigration court before she “stupidly” volunteered to work the detail in Minnesota. Le told the judge that she wasn't properly trained for the assignment. She said she wanted to resign from the job but couldn't get a replacement.\n\n\"Fixing a system, a broken system, I don’t have a magic button to do it. I don’t have the power or the voice to do it,\" she said.\n\nHomeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Le was a probationary attorney.\n\n“This conduct is unprofessional and unbecoming of an ICE attorney in abandoning her obligation to act with commitment, dedication, and zeal to the interests of the United States Government,” McLaughlin said in a statement.\n\nLe and the U.S. Attorney's office in Minnesota didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nKira Kelley, an attorney who represented two petitioners at the hearing, said the flood of immigration petitions is necessary because “so many people being detained without any semblance of a lawful basis.”\n\n“And there’s no indication here that any new systems or bolded e-mails or any instructions to ICE are going to fix any of this,” she added.",

    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia Republican U.S. House member Barry Loudermilk, who has been active in efforts to discredit Democratic-led investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, announced Wednesday that he won't seek reelection this year.\n\nLoudermilk has served in Congress since 2015. He is part of a wave of incumbents exiting the House. So far, 50 are stepping down or running for some other office.\n\nFour Republican-held congressional seats in Georgia will change hands this year. In addition to Loudermilk, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene resigned from her seat in January, setting up a March special election. U.S. Reps. Buddy Carter and Mike Collins are both running for the GOP's U.S. Senate nomination, aiming to unseat incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff.\n\nLoudermilk, 62, said in a statement that he wanted to spend “more dedicated time” with his family.\n\n“I first ran for election to Congress in 2014 and, as I stated then, representing the people in Congress is a service, not a career,\" Loudermilk said. \"And although I continue to have strong support from the people of the 11th Congressional District, I believe it is time to contribute to my community, state, and nation in other ways.”\n\nThe 11th Congressional District, northwest of Atlanta, includes all of Bartow, Gordon and Pickens counties and parts of Cherokee and Cobb counties. The Cook Political Report ranks the district as the fifth-most strongly Republican district of the nine that the GOP holds in Georgia.\n\nBefore serving in Congress, Loudermilk served in the Air Force. He chaired the Bartow County Republican Party and then served six years in the Georgia state House of Representatives and two years in the state Senate.\n\nLoudermilk was scrutinized by the House Jan. 6 committee for giving a tour of parts of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021. The committee suggested that some tour participants may have been examining security measures. Loudermilk denied wrongdoing, saying it was a “smear campaign.”\n\nAfter Republicans took the majority, Loudermilk led a subcommittee that released a report alleging former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney acted improperly on the Democratic-led Jan. 6 committee and calling for her to be investigated for criminal witness tampering. Loudermilk currently leads another subcommittee that is charged with further investigating Jan. 6.",

    "fullText": "O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson’s daughter, Sydney Simpson, is living a quiet life in Florida following the death of her father.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, Sydney, 40, left Los Angeles for St. Petersburg, Florida, where she lives in a small, two-bedroom condo. The outlet reported that Sydney, who was just 8 years old when her mother was murdered, purchased the 955-square-foot unit for $135,000 cash in December 2020.\n\n“It’s lower-income, they’re poor. They’re on Medicare, Medicaid, you know, SNAP [benefits] if they can get them. There’s no job opportunities — there’s nothing in that section of town. Then you get into Downtown and head north, and that’s where the money is,” a man named Peter Gaunt — who has lived in the neighborhood for decades — told the outlet of the area.\n\nThe former Buffalo Bills running back shared Sydney and her brother Justin with his ex-wife, Nicole.\n\nNicole and friend Ron Goldman were brutally murdered outside her Brentwood home in June 1994.\n\nO.J. was charged with their murders, but was later acquitted by a jury. He died at age 76 on April 11, 2024, after a battle with prostate cancer.\n\nPresident Trump Reached Out to ‘Today’ Host Savannah Guthrie Amid Her Mom Nancy’s Disappearance\n\nIvanka Trump Reportedly 'Has Zero Intention of Seeing' Stepmother Melania's Eponymous Documentary\n\nElisabeth Hasselbeck Returning to 'The View' to Replace Alyssa Farah Griffin After Calling Out Joy Behar\n\nThis story O.J.
