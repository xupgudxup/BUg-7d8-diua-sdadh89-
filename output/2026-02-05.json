Finnish Ice Hockey Association spokesperson Henna Malmberg said the remaining 13 players are either infected or in quarantine.\n\nTeams are allowed to dress up to 20 skaters and two goalies.

    "fullText": "Inter Milan teenager Matteo Cocchi offered an honest assessment of his performance in last night’s clash against Torino.\n\nSpeaking to Inter TV via FCInterNews, the 19-year-old insisted that he ‘gave his best’ to help the team reach the Coppa Italia semi-finals.\n\nUnfazed by the magnitude of the occasion, Cristian Chivu bucked tradition by giving several youngsters and fringe players a chance to start.\n\nIndeed, the Romanian coach rotated ten players compared to last Sunday’s Serie A victory at Cremonese.\n\nFLORENCE, ITALY – JANUARY 25: Matteo Cocchi of Italy U17 in action during the International Friendly match between Italy U17 and Spain U17 on January 25, 2023 in Florence, Italy. (Photo by Giuseppe Bellini/Getty Images)\n\nChivu made several bold choices last night.\n\nFor starters, he replaced both starting wingbacks with a couple of Primavera starlets.\n\nTherefore, Matteo Cocchi and Issiaka Kamate started at the expense of Federico Dimarco and Luis Henrique, respectively.\n\nWhile the latter registered an assist for Ange-Yoan Bonny, the former failed to impress in his first senior start for the club.\n\nHowever, there’s no doubt that the Italian youngster left his heart and soul on the pitch.\n\n“I’m happy with this performance,” Cocchi said after teh game. “I tried to give my all on the pitch.\n\n“The team is united, we work for each other and try to give our best. They show me this every day.\n\n“Today was my first time starting; I tried to give my best and fit into this wonderful team. Playing in this shirt is an honor.”",

    "fullText": "Glasgow City have announced the loan signing of Codie Thomas from Manchester City until the end of the 2025/26 season.\n\nIt’s a smart loan move for the 19-year-old defender, who signed her first professional contract with the Women’s Super League club in December 2024.\n\nThomas made her senior Man City debut in the UEFA Women’s Champions League against SKN St. Pölten during the 2024/25 season. Since her debut, she has made three further appearances, with one in the UWCL. While the other two were domestically in both the WSL and Subway League Cup.\n\nThe defender also gained senior experience while on a dual registration deal with AFC Fylde. Khiara Kheating completed the same pathway early in her professional career.\n\nAfter signing for Glasgow City, Thomas said: “I’m really excited to be here, go out there, get some minutes, and show everyone what I am about.\n\n“The game in Scotland is really interesting, and every match is going to be tough. It’s a really good league to come into and to play in.”\n\nHead coach Jane Ross added: “She’s an energetic player who is composed on the ball and works hard out of possession, and has already gained senior experience in England and in the Champions League.\n\n“As we enter a crucial part of the campaign, Codie’s arrival adds more competition and quality to the squad and we look forward to seeing how she contributes during her time in Scotland.”\n\nGlasgow City currently sit top of the Scottish Women’s Premier League standings after 16 games played. They are five points clear ahead of Celtic in second place. Thomas will be eligible to make her debut against Celtic at Petershill Park on Sunday, February 8th.\n\nWSL: No alcohol-related incidents as Fan Choice receives ‘overwhelmingly positive’ feedback\n\nScottishPower and Celtic star Morgan Cross provide new equipment to Dunfermline U14s\n\nSWPL: Katie Lockwood departs Glasgow City for WSL 2 club",

    "description": "One recent DFA reportedly cleared waivers on Wednesday while another was claimed by the organization where he made his MLB debut",
    "fullText": "The waiver wire was a frequent stop for the Washington Nationals through January after the front office navigated through January with seven official claims, though a pair were designated for assignment just days after joining the organization. It marked a sneaky way for president of baseball operations Paul Toboni to restock his Triple-A roster while tweaking the minor league roster, but the pair of designations marked a risky move in the process with a chance for other teams to swoop in.\n\nThat came to reality for a pair of former waiver claims on Wednesday with a mix of good and bad news on a pair of players.\n\nThe good news is that left handed pitcher Konnor Pilkington reportedly cleared waivers on Wednesday, setting the stage for the Nationals to designate him for assignment in Triple-A. Pilkington was designated for assignment last week to make room for shortstop Tsung-Che Chung, who spent the bulk of last season with Pittsburgh’s Triple-A affiliate.\n\nKonnor Pilkington cleared waivers. Waiting on an official announcement if he accepted his outright to Triple-A.\n\n— Talk Nats (@TalkNats) February 5, 2026\n\nAfter making his debut with the Nationals in July of 2025, Pilkington posted a 4.45 ERA last season with the Nationals over 28.1 innings pitched after he was initially drafted in the third round of the 2018 MLB draft by the Chicago White Sox. The pitcher has also spent time within the Cleveland Guardians and Arizona Diamondbacks organizations. Despite an average ERA during his major league tenure, command appeared to be a challenge for the southpaw. Pilkington allowed 17 walks during his 28.1 innings pitched, compared to 34 strikeouts.\n\nPilkington began his career with the Cleveland Guardians in 2022 where he started in 11 games and appeared in 15, finishing the season with a 3.88 ERA and 50 strikeouts to 32 walks. He then made one appearance in 2023 where he tossed a pair of strikeouts in a pair of scoreless inning, though struggled in his limited time in Triple-A. He was traded to Arizona for cash considerations in May of 2023 where he would spend the rest of the season and 2024 with Triple-A Reno.\n\nThe bad news on Wednesday was that Mickey Gasper, who was designed for assignment last week after the team claimed left hander Richard Lovelady, was claimed by the Boston Red Sox. Washington claimed Gasper from the Minnesota Twins in a flurry of moves through January, but now eliminating one potential option in the Nationals' farm system.\n\nThe Red Sox have claimed Mickey Gasper off waivers. HES BACK!!! pic.twitter.com/HKibdDzfJf\n\n— SleeperRedSox (@SleeperRedSox) February 4, 2026\n\nGasper now returns to the organization to gave him his MLB debut after Boston selected Gasper in the minor league phase of the Rule 5 Draft in 2023, making his debut as a pinch hitter in 2024 where he drew four walks and was hit by a pitch despite finishing 0-for-18 in his at-bats with the Red Sox. Gasper spent the 2025 season with the Minnesota Twins where he batted .158/.257/.232 with a pair of home runs, 11 RBIs and two stolen bases in 45 appearances. The Twins then designated him for assignment in mid-January, the first of what has proven to be a flurry of moves for the utility infielder.",

    "fullText": "With the club struggling in Ligue 1, Thiago Scuro has been the subject of criticism from a section of AS Monaco supporters, with the ultras boycotting the first 45 minutes of home games, displaying banners critical of the CEO, and chanting for his resignation.\n\nSpeaking at Wednesday’s press conference, attended by Get French Football News, Scuro responded. “I don’t want to criticise them or come into conflict with them. I understand the groups’ reaction; they have a collective vision. Other supporters stop me when they see me at the stadium, encourage us and believe in what we are trying to do,” began the Brazilian, who succeeded Paul Mitchell in the role.\n\n“I understand that some of our matches could have caused frustration among the supporters, but it’s not just about me, it’s about the players. We had a decisive match to play at home (against Juventus) in order to qualify for the UEFA Champions League playoffs and for 45 minutes, instead of supporting the team and the manager to get the result we wanted, they protested against me. I accept it, but maybe there was another time to do that. The players needed them in that moment, the manager, too. We have to be together in these difficult moments. We are stronger together.”\n\nHe continued, “The only thing that I can give them is the truth and my commitment. I can’t promise them things that are unrealistic for Monaco at this moment in time. I don’t work in football to be popular, but because I like and I learnt how to do this job. I hope that the results will return soon. Sometimes you have to go through the storm to come out [better] on the other side […] of course [the protests] aren’t nice. My son is present at the games. I had this conversation with him to explain what was happening, that these personal attacks aren’t normal. Sometimes, football accepts too much. A personal attack is not normal… but that is also a lesson for my son, so that he understands that life can be like that. If you want to build something, you have to be open and know how to receive criticism and attacks. But I’m taking it well. It gives me energy to give results and luckily, my kids aren’t afraid; that was my only concern when this started.”\n\nScuro also confirmed that his role had slightly evolved, with technical director Carlis Avina taking on further responsibilities. “We just wanted to adjust certain things in our management, notably in the medical and performance department. As I have other responsibilities, it is sometimes hard for me to give the necessary time to these subjects at this moment in time. That is why we have made some changes to Carlos’ role,” said the Monaco CEO.\n\nGFFN | Luke Entwistle – reporting from Monaco",

The 24-year-old’s injury isn’t currently believed to be too serious though, with the expectation that he’ll be back before the match against Tottenham Hotspur later this month.\n\nOdegaard’s non-involvement is a little more disappointing, as Mikel Arteta had hinted that the midfielder could be back in the squad against Sunderland this weekend.\n\nThere’s still time for Odegaard to return to training ahead of Saturday’s game, but with every passing day it becomes less likely.\n\nAs for Timber, the right-back’s absence is a new and unexplained one. Sky report that he “could be a doubt” for the Sunderland match, but we’ll have to wait for Arteta’s pre-match press conference on Friday for a full update.\n\nMikel Merino and Max Dowman are also set to miss the Sunderland match with their own foot and ankle injuries, so it’s possible Arsenal will be without five potential first-team players for the match.",

A victory will be huge for the Gunners as they look to win the Premier League title, but manager Mikel Arteta could have fresh injury concerns. Arsenal had an open training this morning and the trio of Jurrien Timber, Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard were not involved, according to Sky Sports.\n\nWhile Saka missed the game against Chelsea on Tuesday due to a knock he picked up shortly before kick-off against Leeds United last Saturday, Timber played the whole game and Arsenal fans could be worried about his fitness. Odegaard was left out of the Gunners’ squad for their Carabao Cup semi-final as a precaution, and it remains to be seen whether he will return to training ahead of the weekend.\n\nThe Norwegian featured against Leeds, coming off the bench to play 29 minutes. Arsenal need their key players against Sunderland and Arteta will be hoping for some good news on the fitness of the aforementioned trio. He admitted that Odegaard felt a niggle during the Leeds game and was not feeling comfortable on Monday.\n\nThe Arsenal skipper will be desperate to be available for the weekend after he was started on the bench against the Whites.",

I'll never forget it because my youngest was 12 days old so I remember thinking during the first half 'this is the first and last Newcastle game he'll ever come to when I'm playing'.\n\n\"After Chris Hughton, who was popular with the players and fanbase, was dismissed and Andy Carroll left the club in recent months, the dark clouds were circling and were then amplified over the course of the first 45 minutes.\n\n\"We were 2-0 down after three minutes. We just needed to take a breath and get a foothold in the game, but they were relentless.\n\n\"We were 3-0 down after 10 and in shock. When we go 4-0 down after 26 minutes, I remember lying on my back and thinking 'we need half-time now'.\n\n\"I went in and said if any of you so-and-sos wave the white flag I'm going to be the first goalkeeper in Premier League history to let 10 goals in.\n\n\"Alan Pardew, we didn't see eye to eye, but he came in and he was brilliant and said 'Look lads, you need a response, the crowd need to see a response, you need to respond for each other. Your family and friends are in the crowd, what are they going to be thinking?'\n\n\"I thought it was really good because it's not a time to start ranting and raving and turning players on themselves.\n\n\"Kevin [Nolan] refereed the game without the referee knowing. He was an intimidating character who was streetwise. He knew if we tried to play football it would be six or seven - what we needed to do was the dark arts, get competitive and be horrible, which we were in promotion from the Championship.\"\n\nOn Cheick Tiote's equaliser: \"I had the ultimate view. It was perfect, on his weaker foot. Never seen him do anything like it. It had a clear path and I knew it was in.\n\n\"The noise. In 33 years of being in and around St James' Park I've never heard anything like it. Tiote runs the length of the pitch and I ran towards the celebrations and elbowed Leon Best in the hamstring and he has to go off! Maybe we would have won the game if I hadn't.\n\n\"You just do mad things. People still talk about it to this day.\"\n\nCome back later today for fan accounts and more players who featured in the fixture\n\nSend us your memories of the game here\n\nListen to BBC Radio Newcastle's special coverage looking back on the day",

    "fullText": "Mercedes may have landed themselves in the middle of a controversy to start the new Formula 1 regulations.\n\nFans did not get a clear sense of who was fastest at the Barcelona shakedown, but there were early indications that Mercedes could be setting the pace.\n\nNo other team managed to complete more than 500 laps, and while most were still gathering data on day five, Toto Wolff’s side had already packed up and left.\n\nThere was quiet confidence within the Silver Arrows camp during their team launch, with Wolff addressing questions about their power unit straight away.\n\nA compression trick Mercedes are believed to have discovered could give George Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli an edge over their competitors.\n\nA recent report from AMuS has shed some light on what Mercedes might be up to as they get ready for the new season.\n\nAccording to the report, Mercedes are using 3D-printed pistons designed to boost the engine’s compression ratio.\n\nSome engineers believe this setup would only push the ratio up to 17:1, falling short of the 18:1 mark that’s been widely rumoured.\n\nThere’s now a theory floating around that Mercedes have added a small pocket near the top of the cylinder inside their combustion chamber.\n\nThe thinking goes that during FIA static tests, this pocket fills up, allowing Mercedes to meet regulations. But under race conditions, when things heat up and pressure builds, a thin channel connecting to the pocket is said to close off, raising the compression ratio.\n\nThis idea has come from other teams in Formula 1. According to reports, an inquiry was sent over to the FIA and came back with news that this particular method would not be allowed if proven true.\n\nRight now there’s no concrete evidence linking Mercedes directly to this method. However, teams around the paddock are clearly interested in how they’ve managed any potential gains with their power unit heading into 2026.\n\nThere are five different engine manufacturers on the grid this year, but Mercedes are expected to have a clear edge over at least three of them right from the start.\n\nHonda, now working exclusively with Aston Martin, have been struggling since their planned exit from F1 following their split with Red Bull.\n\nMeanwhile, both Red Bull Powertrains and Audi are new to the scene. Despite pulling in talent from other teams, they still don’t match Mercedes’ level of experience.\n\nThe real competition is expected to come from Ferrari. While their engines showed good reliability during testing in Barcelona, it’s still unclear if they can match Mercedes for pace.\n\nFerrari are already working on ways to close the gap to Mercedes’ engine development, but whether that will be enough to put Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc in contention remains to be seen.\n\nFerrari already developing major response to expected FIA decision on Mercedes engine loophole\n\nHow F1’s tallest ever driver measures up against George Russell and Oliver Bearman\n\nThe four F1 drivers who competed in the Winter Olympics including one former Ferrari star",

    "fullText": "Once again, Chelsea are expected to be quite active during the summer transfer window, with one of the main priorities likely being the need to bring in a proper no.9, a dominant centre-forward.\n\nLiam Rosenior’s arrival as manager has sparked some improvement from Joao Pedro, who has scored five goals and provided an assist in his first seven appearances under the new boss. However, Liam Delap continues to struggle in a Blues shirt.\n\nSince his £30 million move from Ipswich last year, Delap has not been able to recapture the form he showed last season. Rosenior even addressed questions from reporters about whether the former Manchester City prospect had lost confidence.\n\nPedro offers more versatility as he can drop deeper into midfield while the Briton is more of a traditional centre-forward who has not quite settled into life at Chelsea just yet. While Emmanuel Emegha is set to arrive, there is every reason to believe that the Blues will also look for another striker during the next window.\n\nChelsea have always had a history of big-name strikers leading the line. Didier Drogba, Fernando Torres, Diego Costa, and Romelu Lukaku are just a few names that come to mind. Right now, though, that is exactly what they are missing.\n\nThat gap could be filled this summer. According to CalcioMercato, Chelsea have started discussions over a potential free transfer for Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic.\n\nVlahovic is currently on £200,000 a week in Turin and is set to become a free agent at the end of the season. The report also notes that Milan are interested, but his wage demands could be an obstacle.\n\nEngland seems a more likely destination where his salary expectations can be met. CM reports that both Chelsea and Newcastle have made enquiries about signing Vlahovic on a free transfer this summer.\n\nThere have been long-standing links between Chelsea and Vlahovic, dating back well before the January window. Earlier this year, reports suggested that the Blues were offered a chance to sign the Serbian striker for £20m, though nothing came of it and he remained at Juventus.\n\nIf there is no contract extension, Vlahovic is expected to finish out the season with Juventus before leaving as a free agent. It is a far cry from when ESPN reported that Chelsea once tabled a £69m offer for him.\n\nThat bid came during Mauricio Pochettino’s time in charge when Chelsea appeared close to getting a deal over the line. Few would have predicted back then that he might eventually join them on a free transfer.\n\nChelsea’s £20m backup goalkeeper set for summer exit despite impressing Rosenior\n\nLiverpool player sends message to Tyrique George after Everton move",

    "description": "The Official World Golf Rankings ruled that only the top 10 finishers at LIV Golf events will be awarded world ranking points",
    "fullText": "Jon Rahm has lamented the restrictions put on LIV Golf as unfair after the Official World Golf Rankings (OWGR) awarded the tour world ranking points five years after its establishment.\n\nThe OWGR approved LIV’s submission for ranking points with some conditions due to the less than traditional nature of the breakaway tour, including the lower competitive fields, and awarded LIV players world ranking points if they finish in the top 10.\n\nThe Saudi Arabia-backed league called the decision a “long overdue moment of recognition” but revealed its disappointment at the limits placed on them from the OWGR, demanding a more “transparent” and “equal” system which does “reflect performance over affiliation”.\n\nAnd while Rahm admitted his delight “that we’re being recognised in a way”, he hit out at the harsher treatment given to LIV golfers.\n\n“I don't like how we're not being treated the same as every other tour,” he said at LIV Golf’s season opener in Riyadh.\n\n\"It seems like the rules that have been in place don't really apply to us, with only 10 of us getting points.\n\n\"It doesn't seem fair. The small fields out there throughout the course of the year, their players get full points.\"\n\nThe Spaniard, a two-time major winner, still believes there is “work to be done” as he highlighted the pitfalls of the restrictions.\n\n\"While it's good for some people, it could cause some players to actually lose world ranking points instead of gaining them because finishing 11th is basically a missed cut, and we're already adding to the divisor,” Rahm added.\n\n\"But I'm thankful that LIV Golf got their foot in the door, and there's a possibility for us to walk in the room and be recognised as a tour, as we should be.\"\n\nThe significance of LIV obtaining OWGR points is because they are important to players aiming to qualify for the annual four majors. The rankings are worked out via a two-year rolling system with more weight given to the most recent results.",

    "fullText": "Iga Swiatek may be caught off guard by how closely she stacks up against Serena Williams at the same stage of their careers.\n\nLeading into the Australian Open, Swiatek had lost two matches in a row, something she hadn’t dealt with before.\n\nStill, the world number two made it to the quarterfinals in Melbourne before falling to Elena Rybakina, who later claimed the title.\n\nEven though it wasn’t her best run at a major, Swiatek still managed to tie one of Williams’ records and there are more parallels between the two than many might assume.\n\nAt just 24, Swiatek has already collected six Grand Slam titles, her most recent coming at Wimbledon in 2024.\n\nThe Pole has been especially dominant at Roland Garros, where four of those titles have come on the clay courts.\n\nWilliams is often mentioned as the greatest women’s player in history and she still holds more major trophies than anyone else in the Open Era. And with rumours about a comeback now circulating, it’s worth looking back to when Williams was the same age as Swiatek is today.\n\nAt that stage of her career, Serena had won seven majors – only one more than what Swiatek currently has.\n\nSwiatek also leads Williams at this stage when it comes to WTA 1000 titles and both had already captured a WTA Finals crown by that point in their careers.\n\nYou could make the case that Serena was facing a tougher field back then, with players like her sister Venus, Justine Henin, Maria Sharapova and Lindsay Davenport all active during that period.\n\nTennis fans sometimes forget just how good Swiatek is. Looking at her numbers side by side with Williams shows she’s on pace for an extraordinary career – if she isn’t already there.\n\nWhile they never actually played against each other, Serena Williams still managed to influence one of Iga Swiatek’s wins at the US Open.\n\nAlthough she’s been retired for over three years, Williams has occasionally shown up at tournaments, including an appearance at the 2024 US Open.\n\nBefore Swiatek’s third-round match against Grand Slam finalist Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova – who had recently dropped in the rankings – she got a chance to chat with Williams.\n\nAfter her 6-4, 6-2 win over Pavlyuchenkova, Swiatek spoke about how that encounter gave her a positive lift before the match.\n\n“It was really nice to see her,” Swiatek said in her press conference at the time. “She has a lot of positive energy. It’s nice that she came on-site and she was chatting with the players, because for me, yeah, I still felt, even though we met before and for like couple of years we have been on the same sides and on tour together, she’s still like star-striking me (smiling).\n\n“It was nice that she approach me, because I wouldn’t, for sure, find courage to do that (smiling) if it was the other way. But, yeah, she’s really nice and really positive.\n\n“I’m happy that she’s following tennis, you know, and like my game because she told me that she’s cheering for me. It’s always nice to hear that from somebody like Serena.”\n\nThis year is expected to be Williams’ last appearance in New York as it has been heavily rumoured that she could reunite with Venus one more time.\n\nThis year could also see some changes to mixed doubles after its revamp last season. Swiatek reached the final alongside Casper Ruud last year.\n\nIga Swiatek messages Lindsey Vonn as she suffers nightmare injury before the Winter Olympics\n\nVenus Williams’ next tournament revealed after early Australian Open exit\n\nJannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz warned to ‘be careful’ of Novak Djokovic",

    "description": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique. The Briton's love of the NFL began with a 1986 video cassette - now he is coaching in sport's biggest game.",
    "fullText": "Aden Durde's journey to Sunday's Super Bowl is not just unusual, it's unique.\n\nAlthough he played professionally, he began his coaching career far from the NFL, playing in London's Finsbury Park in the British amateur game.\n\nYet he has blazed a trail all the way to the Super Bowl, breaking down barriers to become the first overseas coach to reach one of the biggest games in world sport.\n\nAs the Seattle Seahawks' defensive coordinator, one rung down from head coach, the 46-year-old has played a pivotal role in them getting to the NFL's title decider.\n\nSpeaking in California during the \"madness\" of Super Bowl week, the humble Briton has praised the youth coaches that \"changed his life\" by giving him a purpose.\n\nMeanwhile, many he met along the way have spoken of their pride at seeing his hard work pay off, such as Super Bowl winner Leslie Frazier, one of his colleagues on Seattle's coaching staff.\n\n\"He has been able to overcome so much in the course of his career,\" Frazier told BBC Sport. \"When I think about how he got started and where he is today, it just blows your mind. It's an incredible story.\"\n\nDurde and his older brother were raised by a single mother in north London, and it was a video she bought, of the Chicago Bears' 1986 Super Bowl-winning team, that inspired him to play American football.\n\nHe played youth football in Hayes, at Finsbury Park and then in south London, for the London Olympians and London Capitals.\n\nSome 30 years on, Durde's eyes light up at the mention of his first coach Geoff O'Driscoll. Durde followed him from team to team and O'Driscoll drove him across London twice a week, a two-hour trip each way, so that he could keep playing.\n\n\"Those people, that work as volunteers, they help kids from areas [where they] maybe don't have the funds to do something,\" said Durde. \"They literally change people's lives, and Geoff done that for me.\n\n\"Geoff, [long-time British coach] Tony Allen, those guys are pivotal in where I am [in the NFL], but also where I am as a man. I didn't have many male role models growing up and to see these guys helping people, not asking for credit, always turning up… it's huge.\"\n\nDurde was a team-mate of Tony's son Marvin Allen, and the pair have been close friends for 30 years. They both played in the now-defunct NFL Europe league and made it onto NFL practice squads.\n\nThey played against each other in Europe and for a while linebacker Durde had a picture of him tackling wide receiver Allen on his fridge.\n\n\"He was very tough and aggressive,\" said Allen. \"He was very smart in terms of how he diagnosed plays and watched film. He was very much a student of the game.\"\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nAfter Durde ended his playing career, the father of two took charge of childcare while his wife Kate trained to be a midwife.\n\nHe then started a business helping children who were out of the education system and in 2011 became defensive coordinator of the London Warriors.\n\nYet he still found time to carry out extra voluntary work, mentoring children in north London. Durde was giving back before he'd even 'made it' himself.\n\n\"At first, it was nothing to do with professional coaching,\" he said. \"It was doing what other guys had done for me.\"\n\nAllen added: \"You end up being more than just a football coach, which I think Ad was for a lot of people. He'd provide them with an opportunity if he could, but it's also just steering them in the right direction.\n\n\"It's about making sure that those around you are also being nourished and enriched. He was really good at that.\"\n\nThose included Efe Obada, who grew up in foster care after being abandoned on the streets of London aged 10. When he attended a Warriors training session aged 22, Durde knew Obada could go beyond the amateur game.\n\nHe prepared him for an NFL try-out, with the pair training on public parks in London at 6am before doing their day job - Obada in a factory while Durde was now leading an NFL community programme.\n\n\"He was instrumental in my journey,\" said Obada, who played for seven seasons in the NFL. \"He invested his time outside of the game and poured into me.\"\n\nDurde was chaperoning a group of Warriors players on a trip to Texas when he got his big break.\n\nA contact from his time in NFL Europe told him to go buy a shirt as he'd secured him an interview with the Dallas Cowboys, who offered Durde an internship in 2014.\n\nThe Cowboys' head coach was Jason Garrett, who will work on Sunday's game as an analyst for US broadcaster NBC.\n\n\"I love him,\" he said. \"We were so fortunate, he made such a positive impression on everybody when he was there.\n\n\"He had this great balance of humility and wanted to learn from everybody, but also real strength in how he communicated and how he coached players.\n\n\"He had so much credibility because of how hard he worked and his knowledge. You weren't afraid at all to put him in situations where he's coaching players, because everybody respected him. I'm just so happy for him, he's an all-time great person.\"\n\nDurde helped Simon Buckett transition into coaching and the ex-Warriors player is now the team's general manager.\n\n\"He came back from Dallas and it was the same Aden, but with more ammunition, more knowledge of the game,\" said Buckett. \"His eyes had been opened.\n\n\"Myself and another coach would meet Aden every Tuesday and Thursday and he'd be tearing apart our next opponent, putting in new plays. We realised 'we're not going to have him very long, he's too good'.\"\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nWhen Durde returned from further internships in 2015 and 2016 - with Dallas and the Atlanta Falcons - he continued to work for the NFL in London, sharing an office with two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora.\n\nThe pair came up with the idea of a programme to help international athletes transition to the NFL, effectively an American football crash-course which became known as the International Player Pathway.\n\nDurde later ran the programme, which helped Obada get signed by the Carolina Panthers in 2017. Later that year Durde was the first American football coach to work-out ex-rugby league player Jordan Mailata.\n\nAs with Obada, Durde soon saw his potential and the Australian came through the programme before being drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2018. He is now one of the NFL's best offensive tackles and won last year's Super Bowl.\n\n\"Jordan went from not knowing any of the position names to being drafted in four months,\" said Henry Hodgson, general manager of NFL UK & Ireland, who used to write a players' diary for Durde on the NFL Europe website.\n\n\"For Aden to have uploaded enough of his knowledge for someone to be drafted and go on to where he is now, that tells you what a great teacher he is.\"\n\nIt was then that Durde realised he could become an NFL coach.\n\n\"To do that from the UK is unprecedented because there isn't an obvious pathway,\" Hodgson added.\n\n\"The fact that Aden not only has done it, but has got to the level he's at now speaks to someone who is single minded, will figure stuff out for themselves and has the wherewithal to make something work if it's their passion or their dream.\"\n\nAllen always felt that Durde, who had two head-coach interviews last month, had \"the juice\" to become an NFL coach.\n\n\"He has the authenticity and the communication skills, and when you have that, you can conjure belief in people,\" he said.\n\n\"He's a very honest person and I think a lot of people buy into that, pretty much instantly.\"\n\nDurde became a full-time NFL coach with Atlanta in 2018, before returning to Dallas as their defensive line coach from 2021-2023.\n\nWhen Mike Macdonald, a defensive coach, took Seattle's top job in 2024, he made Durde his defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Seahawks narrowly missed out on the play-offs in their first season but in their second they had the NFL's joint-best record with the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots. They face the latter in Santa Clara on Sunday.\n\nNBC analyst Tony Dungy, who won the Super Bowl as a player and coach, said: \"[Durde's] done an outstanding job there, and I think when you watch their defence play, you see the energy, the excitement, but you also see discipline and a fundamentally sound team. So I think it's been fantastic, and I think the sky is the limit for him.\"\n\nThe Seahawks' defence allowed the fewest points during the regular season (17.2 per game) and although Durde stood out as a player for his physicality, he is calm and clear as a coach.\n\n\"This is their second year being around Ad and there's a marked difference in the way they play the game from a belief and confidence standpoint,\" said Allen.\n\n\"They're not just getting to the ball, they're believing that when they do, good things are going to happen. It's that 2% more that takes a team from just missing the play-offs to being a Super Bowl contender.\n\n\"There's definitely an imprint of Ad when I watch the Seahawks. It's like Star Wars, you can turn to the dark side and let it eat you up. But as a leader you have to refrain and keep your emotions [in check].\"\n\nAs it happens, Durde's defence has become known as the Dark Side.\n\nThe Seattle defence that helped the Seahawks to their only Super Bowl win in 2014 is known as the Legion of Boom while the Chicago defence that inspired Durde in the 1980s is still regarded as arguably the best of all-time. Now his defence has earned its own nickname.\n\n\"I love it,\" he said. \"These guys push themselves not to replicate the Legion of Boom, but to live up to a standard, and now they're creating their own identity.\"\n\nSeattle's assistant head coach Frazier was a defensive back in the Bears' Super Bowl-winning team that captured the imagination of a youngster in north London. Exactly 40 years later, they could be lifting the Lombardi Trophy together.\n\n\"It's humbling for me to work with Aden, to know how much he admired what we did, how it influenced him, and to see where he is today,\" he said.\n\n\"I tease him all the time. I say, 'one day, there's going to be a book written about you. There's going to be a documentary about your life'. It's just a great story.\"\n\nBack in London, the Warriors plan to watch Sunday's big game together in Croydon, although Allen wants to make sure he can focus on the action at home.\n\n\"We're all very proud because what Aden's done has never been done before,\" he said. \"When you factor in how much of a minority sport it is in the UK, in particular when he was coming up, it's amazing. There's not many stories like it, in any sport.\n\n\"It would not surprise me at all if this ends up being the story we want it to be. It's legendary. And if he can win one Super Bowl, he's going to want more.\"\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "Should the Detroit Lions trade for Maxx Crosby?",
    "description": "With Maxx Crosby potentially on his way out with the Raiders, should the Detroit Lions get involved.",
    "fullText": "It’s the offseason, which means it’s time again to debate the Detroit Lions making a big, splashy move at defensive end.\n\nWhile I think the discussion is generally tired, because general manager Brad Holmes has often said that the team is not necessarily in a position to make a big move considering all of the hefty contracts that will be due for their own players, it is a new offseason, and it’s possible his priorities have changed.\n\nPlus, with the recent comments from NFL insider Jay Glazer speculating that Maxx Crosby has played his final game with the Las Vegas Raiders, it has sparked the discussion again over social media. Now, to be clear, Glazer’s comments are speculative in nature, and neither Crosby nor the Raiders have made any sort of public comments on the defensive end’s future. That said, last year ended with some issues between the two, and it’s certainly possible that Crosby doesn’t want to endure yet another Raiders rebuild, as Glazer suggests.\n\nThe Lions have a huge need for a defensive lineman opposite Aidan Hutchinson, and the opportunity to have an All-Pro talent like Crosby doesn’t come along very often. So today’s Question of the Day is:\n\nMy answer: This is going to sound like a cop-out, but they certainly should at least entertain the idea.\n\nFor one, Crosby has spoken highly of the Lions’ organization several times. He’s praised Dan Campbell, Penei Sewell, and even expressed some envy that his childhood favorite team is finally getting good when he plays for another team. His admiration for this organization likely means he’d be very agreeable to join Detroit should the right deal come along.\n\nPlus, Crosby just fits everything the Lions are about. He’s relentless, just as good in the run game as he is in the pass game, and he can give opposing offenses fits trying to figure out where to deploy extra help between himself and Hutchinson.\n\nBut cost always needs to be discussed when proposing a blockbuster trade like this, and this trade would come at an enormous cost for the Lions. Glazer suggests the trade could net the Raiders more than the Cowboys got in the trade for Micah Parsons. As a reminder, here were the terms of that trade:\n\nI don’t know what the Lions’ equivalent of a Kenny Clark is, but the point is, it would cost the Lions at least two first-round picks, likely more. Given how strong a drafter Holmes is—and Detroit’s need to continually add young, cheap talent to offset their expensive foundation—that’s a pretty big risk.\n\nIn terms of his contract, the Lions would assume the remaining four years on Crosby’s deal, which includes salaries between $26.5-30 million for each season. While only his 2026 salary is guaranteed, the structure of that deal is interesting. Detroit could continue to restructure those salaries into signing bonuses to lower its cap hit significantly in the short term, but kick the can down the road into future years.\n\nIn short, I think the Lions could actually make it work with those restructures—but given that players like Jared Goff, Penei Sewell, and Amon-Ra St. Brown are also likely headed for contract restructures, we’re talking about a Saints-like cap situation down the road. At some point, that bill is going to be severely limiting, something I’m unsure the Lions will be willing to endure.\n\nWhile I think the chance that Holmes does something like this is pretty unlikely, I’ll admit I’m a little more open to it than I have been in past years. It’s still pretty irresponsible financially, but it does feel like there’s a little more urgency right now, given what happened last year and given some of the potential losses facing Detroit’s defense this offseason. And it’s not every day a Maxx Crosby-like player can fall into your lap.\n\nWhat do you think about a Maxx Crosby trade? Should the Lions go all-in? Is it even worth talking about, given Holmes’ propensity to keep most of his big moves internally? Share your thoughts at the bottom of the page.",

    "fullText": "Former Indiana University and Center Grove High School star and 2019 Indiana Mr. Basketball Trayce Jackson-Davis has been traded from the Golden State Warriors to the Toronto Raptors for a 2026 second-round pick according to several reports Wednesday night including one from ESPN's Shams Charania.\n\nJackson-Davis, a four-time All-Big Ten pick and 2022-23 consensus All-American at Indiana, averaged 6.6 points and 4.6 rebounds per game in 15.1 minutes per game in three seasons with the Warriors. He started 16 games as a rookie and 37 games last year in his second season, but he appeared in just 36 of the Warriors' 51 games this season and averaged 4.2 points and 3.1 rebounds per game in 11.4 minutes per game this season. The Warriors acquired Al Horford in the offseason and with him, Quinten Post, Draymond Green and others getting minutes at center, Jackson-Davis spent much of the season out of the mix.\n\nThe Warriors also acquired center Kristaps Porzingis from the Hawks for former Pacers guard Buddy Hield and forward Jonathan Kuminga on Wednesday, so moving Jackson-Davis opens up space for Porzingis, who has missed the last 12 games with Achilles tendinitis.\n\nJackson-Davis is one of several players with Indiana ties who have changed NBA teams prior to the trade deadline. Former Purdue, Mishawaka Marian and La Lumiere star Jaden Ivey was traded from the Pistons to the Bulls earlier this week. Former Park Tudor and La Lumiere star Jaren Jackson Jr. was traded along with former IPFW star Jon Konchar from the Grizzlies to the Jazz. Former Lawrence North and Ohio State star Mike Conley Jr. has been traded twice from the Timberwolves to the Bulls and then from the Bulls to the Hornets and might end up being waived and returning to the Timberwolves.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Trayce Jackson-Davis, ex-Indiana basketball star, traded from Warriors to Raptors",

    "fullText": "The sporting director of Girona FC, Quique Cárcel, assessed the winter transfer market today in a press conference where he admitted that “it was a market that started with not very good feelings, but the results have given us peace of mind.” As he explained, “the goal was to bring in players who could be important so that Michel would have more options,” and in this regard, he highlighted that “Echeverri brings us different things. With Fran Beltrán, we made an effort because he is an important player who can compete with Witsel and Iván Martin.” Cárcel also emphasized that “we brought in Ter Stegen because obviously, he is a great goalkeeper.” Regarding the team's current form, he celebrated that “the team is in a good moment with a positive dynamic that was broken on the day of the Oviedo match, but I highly value the work they are doing.”\n\nOne of Cárcel's initial concerns was the solidity of the defensive block. He explained that “I was very worried about the defensive aspect, but for some time now, the team has been much more solid in this regard. I know we only have one pure left-back, but we have other options, Arnau, Blind...” Regarding the midfield market, he detailed that “we wanted to bring in two players, but in the end, we decided to bet on Fran. On the other hand, in attack, with Echeverri coming in, we believed we strengthened this line well.”\n\nTer Stegen's injury has been one of the most sensitive points. Cárcel admitted that “what happened to Ter Stegen is very tough. He came with great enthusiasm, and the injury has been a very hard blow for him and for us, logically, it has also been a problem.” He wanted to make it clear that “we are here for whatever Marc needs and to ensure he recovers in the best possible way. During his time with us, he has shown that he is an excellent person both on a human and professional level.”\n\nRegarding the continuity of the coach, he assured that “Michel knows that the Club and Quique Cárcel want him to renew. What Michel and Girona are doing is the most sensible thing. We are focused on the objectives in a complicated year with a very tough start. Only with unity between the coaching staff, players, and Club have we been able to get out of the relegation zone. Michel is the right person to carry this forward, and I am convinced that he wants to renew.”\n\nDespite the improvement in the standings, Cárcel warned that “we have come out of the danger zone, but let’s not forget that we can fall back into it,” and he emphasized that “no one has the absolute truth, but our job is to manage difficult situations.”\n\nFinally, he praised Gazzaniga's performance in goal: “I can only speak wonders. He has been key for us, he has given us a lot.” On the other hand, he also wanted to highlight the work of the second team: “In the reserve team, there are many good players who can start getting professional minutes. They are having an excellent season, and their coach is too. I am very happy with the work of Girona B.”",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets officially ended the soul searching portion of their offseason today, announcing the hire of Frank Reich as their new offensive coordinator.\n\nIn a move that feels both like a safe veteran play and a massive gamble, Head Coach Aaron Glenn has effectively handed Reich the keys to the kingdom. Glenn made it clear during the search that he wanted a head coach of the offense someone who could operate with total autonomy while Glenn refocuses on calling the defensive plays.\n\nBut for Jets fans, the question isn’t about Reich’s resume. It’s about which version of the man is stepping off the plane at Newark.\n\nTo understand the anxiety at One Jets Drive, you have to look at the two polar opposite outcomes of Reich’s recent career.\n\nThe Quarterback Whisperer (2017-2020) This is the Reich the Jets are praying for. This is the architect who helped Doug Pederson guide Nick Foles to a Super Bowl ring. This is the man who took a washed Philip Rivers in 2020 and squeezed out an 11-5 playoff season. This version of Reich is Multiple in the best way he adapts his scheme to his players, uses RPOs to protect his QB, and leans on a physical run game to set up deep shots.\n\nThe Scheme Rigid Veteran (2022-2023) This is the Reich who was fired mid season in back to back years. In Carolina, he was criticized for trying to force Bryce Young into a static pocket system that didn’t fit the rookie’s traits. The offense became predictable, horizontal, and frankly boring. This version of Reich prioritizes the system over the personnel, resulting in an offense that ranks in the bottom five of every meaningful category.\n\nIf Reich returns to his roots, the biggest winners are Breece Hall(If we bring him back. Please come back!) and Garrett Wilson.\n\nThe Run Game: Reich’s best years in Indy featured a dominant Jonathan Taylor. With Breece Hall, Reich has a weapon that can execute the Wide Zone scheme that defines his best work.\n\nThe X Factor: Garrett Wilson is the perfect rhythm receiver for Reich’s West Coast hybrid. If Reich can get back to the Triangle Reads and Mesh concepts that made the 2017 Eagles so dangerous, Wilson could see a career high in targets.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have a Saturday lunchtime kick-off this weekend as interim manager Michael Carrick aims to make it four wins from four by beating Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford. Carrick’s 100% record in this stint as interim is all the more impressive given that two of the victories came against the two best sides in the country, Arsenal and Manchester City.\n\nA pulsating tie against Fulham last weekend also ended in victory after a superb last-minute swivel-and-shoot goal from substitute Ben Sesko.\n\nWhether that sublime bit of skill and calmness under pressure will be enough to see the Slovenian reinstated into the starting line-up is probably the biggest dilemma the boss will have to face when naming his side.\n\nAn unchanged defence is once again expected despite shipping two goals against the Cottagers. This means Senne Lammens in goal, Diogo Dalot at right-back, Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez the centre-backs and Luke Shaw at left-back.\n\nTyrell Malacia was stopped from completing a loan move this week, suggesting there may be a fitness issue with Shaw. This could be confirmed at the pre-match press conference this afternoon (available here from around 3pm).\n\nNouss Mazraoui is another defensive option, as are Ayden Heaven and Leny Yoro, but Matthijs de Ligt is unlikely to be fit after a long injury.\n\nPatrick Dorgu is also out injured.\n\nThe midfield trio of Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes is also likely to be unchanged. Casemiro put in a masterclass against Fulham and will continue to keep Manuel Ugarte on the sidelines.\n\nWithout the option of Dorgu, Carrick could also leave his forward line of Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha unchanged. However, Sesko is knocking very loudly on the door. If he were introduced, the Brazilian is the most likely to give way even though it would mean either Amad or Mbeumo playing on the left.\n\nMason Mount and Josh Zirkzee are other options but are unlikely to be in the frame for a starting berth.\n\nUnchanged side likely, with two possible exceptions.\n\nLuke Shaw’s fitness may be an issue.\n\nBen Sesko could force his way in.\n\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Notre Dame football was active on Wednesday’s Signing Day, as they offered three new prospects. Find out who the Irish are now recruiting.",
    "fullText": "With Notre Dame football officially being able to move on from the 2026 recruiting class on Wednesday, they’ve recently been making multiple offers to prospects in the coming classes.\n\nThey have many offers out to the 2027, as while there were two signed, quarterback Teddy Jarrard was already a commit and kicker Micah Drescher had previously signed with Michigan. What that means is that the focus has turned to the next cycle and the upcoming ones as well.\n\nThe focus on Wednesday wasn’t the 2027 class, it was 2028 and 2029. Sure, those signing periods are coming up anytime soon, but getting a head start on top recruits can only be seen as a positive.\n\nFind out below the three new Notre Dame offers with a quick bio and where they rank in the 247Sports Composite.\n\nAfter a great conversation with @JourdanBlake_ I'm blessed and humbled to be offered by The University of Norte Dame @CharlesPower @adamgorney @ChadSimmons_ @GregBiggins @BrandonHuffman @BlairAngulo @TrillionBoys7v7 pic.twitter.com/fsgVvLM5dA\n\n— Kiingbaraka Kizzee (@kiingbaraka6) February 4, 2026\n\nAn extremely early offer following a big freshman year, Kizzee is very long at 6-foot, 3-inches and 175-pounds. You have to wonder if he’ll be a safety or grown into a linebacker. Kizzee now has over ten offers, as the Californian looks like he’ll be able to choose where ever he wants to go at the next level, and hopefully thats South Bend.\n\nAfter a great conversation with @coachseider i’m blessed to receive an offer from Norte Dame #GoIrish☘️! @CoachTroop3 @GregBiggins @adamgorney @ChadSimmons_ @BrandonHuffman @BlairAngulo @TheUCReport @djbryant13 @PrepRedzoneCA pic.twitter.com/WUeugdu7Tz\n\n— Makai Buchanan (@MakaiBuchanan24) February 4, 2026\n\nAnother offer out to a Californian, as the state has always been a focus for the Irish. Buchanan is a 5-foot, 11-inch and 180-pounder who could end up as a running back or slot receiver. This one could be tough for Notre Dame, as it does look like he’d like to stay close to home according to this 247Sports report.\n\nBlessed to recieve an offer from the University of Notre Dame!!@coachsjacksonjr @JourdanBlake_ @LancasterFBwebo pic.twitter.com/jgUABtJt2W\n\n— James Foster III (@2wayFoster) February 5, 2026\n\nNotre Dame saved the best for last, as Foster is the only one ranked at the moment, mostly due to being a class ahead. The 6-foot, 1-inch and 195-pound safety is the No. 29 overall player in the class, as potential star from Texas. Foster is the type of safety the Irish coaching staff love, and he’d look great in Blue and Gold.\n\nContact/Follow us @IrishWireND on X (Formerly Twitter), and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Notre Dame news, notes, and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire: Notre Dame offered a 5-star and two 2029 prospects on Wednesday",

    "description": "The Italian Olympics arena set to host hockey has had a rocky road to the tournament.",
    "fullText": "All eyes are on Milan and Cortina as the 2026 Winter Olympics get underway. However, not all the news has been positive in the lead up to these Olympics, as frustrating construction issues have caused massive headaches around the rink set to host the men's and women's hockey tournaments.\n\nBack in December 2025, news broke that the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena was beset by construction issues that delayed tests of the rink. Originally, the rink was supposed to house Olympic-sized ice, but reports then surfaced that the arena will have an ice surface smaller than NHL standard, which is already smaller than the international dimensions. Not only that, there was reportedly no Plan B if the arena wasn't ready in time, which meant work had to be done around the clock to get Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena up and running.\n\nThen in January 2026, just a few short weeks away from the Olympics, reports surfaced that while the playing surface, practice facilities and dressing rooms were finished, other parts of the arena might not be done in time. The arena also is set to house fewer people than expected, as original plans had 16,000 seats in the arena while the latest count sits at 11,800 seats.\n\nThe doom and gloom over Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena's construction certainly cast a pall over the start of the Olympic festivities. However, based on recent reports, it seems as if things have fallen into place for the arena. The NHL was reportedly pleased by the mid-January ice test and members of the French team have since taken to the rink to practice with no glaring issues. French captain Pierre-Édouard Bellemare told The Associated Press that skating \"feel[s] like you're on a lake a little bit\" but overall the verdict was \"not bad\" even if some final touches still needed to be done.\n\nOf course, once fans get into the arena and more players and media begin to arrive, it's possible other issues arise or are brought to light. For now though, it seems as if the arena will be up and running to house the hockey tournaments this February.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: The Milan Cortina Olympic hockey arena issues, explained",

    "fullText": "Lando Norris has revealed that David Beckham appeared in his direct messages after he won the 2025 Formula 1 drivers' championship, as he opened up about the ex-footballer's support.\n\nSince celebrating his first championship title, the Briton has been working his way through his messages while also taking some time away over the winter break before returning to preparations for the 2026 season.\n\n\"Honestly, I've not read half of them,\" Norris admitted on The Fast And The Curious podcast when asked who had popped up in his messages after the victory.\n\n\"I have so many that I've not even looked at. I need to, but it takes quite a while. I have probably replied to half of them. So, I've still got four days of trying to just go through every single one, whether it's on Instagram or on WhatsApp or something, but there's just a lot of amazing people.\n\n\"There's a lot of people from different sports. Whether they're incredible at the sport, like one of the best, or they're people that I've watched growing up, young people, old people.\n\n\"When you see something like that, the amount of support you get or just congratulations and respect is something that I admire a lot. It's a beautiful thing. But I do apologise to anyone that I've not responded to yet.\"\n\nWhen pressed on Beckham potentially messaging him, the McLaren driver added: \"I mean, we speak every now and then about different things. He did send me a message. David is always great. He's in the garage every now and then in Bahrain, Qatar, and a few different places. He's a cool guy, so it's always nice when his name pops up for sure.\"\n\nNorris took part in the private testing in Barcelona from 26 to 30 January before heading to Bahrain for McLaren's season launch on 9 February. Further testing will then take place two days later at the same venue from 11 to 13 February and again on 18 to 20 February.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

Globo, the first team outside the relegation zone, has 2 points.\n\nWhile América languishes at the bottom, albeit judicially, rival ABC remains in the isolated lead with 14 points, after securing a heroic draw against Globo in the 48th minute of the second half.\n\nThe future of América-RN will be decided first in court this Thursday (5).\n\nIf the penalty is upheld, the club will compete in the state Serie B in 2027.\n\nFeatured photo: Reproduction/X/@AmericaFCNatal/João Filho/ACD Potiguar\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "“They are considering it, and I hope that Francesco will truly be useful for Roma, because he is part of it.” The main advisor of Roma, Claudio Ranieri, revealed in an interview with Sky Sport who could be the club’s next big signing: the legendary former captain Francesco Totti.\n\nTalks have already taken place between the parties, and an agreement for Totti’s return to the club could soon be finalized. Totti was Roma’s director during the Pallotta era. After retiring in 2017, the club initially appointed him as technical director, and later gave him a broader role as coach and club advisor, working directly with the American management.\n\nHowever, his time at the club was brief. In June 2019, Totti officially resigned, explaining at a press conference that he had never been actively involved in technical and strategic decisions. He stated, in fact, that he had been “marginalized” and lacked operational power. Since then, he has not held any executive position at Roma, dedicating himself to business activities (his scouting and management agency CT10) and serving as an ambassador.\n\n📸 Simone Arveda - 2023 Getty Images\n\nSince Ranieri’s return to Roma, many decisions have been made, and it seems they have been good ones. He appointed Gasperini as coach, signed a sporting director like Frederic Massara who worked with Paolo Maldini at Milan, has been guiding the signings, and now wants Totti to return.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva's former coach is back at the Winter Olympics, this time working with a Georgian athlete, and the World Anti-Doping Agency isn't happy about it.\n\nWADA president Witold Banka said Thursday at the Milan Cortina Games that he's not comfortable with Eteri Tutberidze’s presence at the competition. She is accredited with Georgia as the coach of European champion Nika Egadze.\n\nValieva, then aged 15, was at the center of a legal battle during the 2022 Beijing Games when a sample she gave two months earlier tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine. The revelation came after Valieva won team gold with other Russian skaters. She was later disqualified from that event, which upgraded the United States to gold. Valieva was a contender for the women’s gold medal but placed fourth and was criticized rink-side by Tutberidze.\n\n“It’s not our decision the coach is here,” Banka said Thursday at a news conference in Milan. “The investigation found no evidence that this particular person was engaged in this doping process, so there’s no legal basis to exclude her from the presence during the Olympic Games.”\n\n“But of course, if you ask me personally about my feelings,” he continued, “I don’t feel comfortable with her presence here in the Olympic Games, for sure.”\n\nThe Georgian Figure Skating Federation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nValieva's ban expired in December, despite legal efforts to have it overturned.\n\nRules have been changed to raise the minimum age for skaters to 17 in time for the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "Barcelona appear to have made a decision regarding the future of Marcus Rashford.\n\nAfter the Englishman’s stunning start to life in La Liga, the club is now leaning strongly towards keeping the forward beyond his current loan spell.\n\nAccording to an update from SPORT, Barcelona have decided to pay the full €30 million price included in Rashford’s deal, as it is considered a fair and acceptable price by the board.\n\nIn fact, the club is said to be fully satisfied with the winger’s impact, both in terms of performance on the pitch and his integration into the squad.\n\nThere is reportedly a unanimous feeling about the situation, and the plan is to activate the €30 million clause and complete the transfer permanently.\n\nUnlike before, there is no intention to negotiate a lower fee, as Manchester United are not willing to reduce their demands.\n\nEven so, Barcelona believe the price reflects the player’s quality, especially when compared to the high valuations of similar attackers on the market.\n\nBarcelona have decided to sign Marcus Rashford. (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nUnless there is an unexpected issue in the remaining months of the loan, such as physical problems, the deal is expected to be finalised towards the end of the season.\n\nRashford would then sign a contract for three more seasons with the Catalan club, securing his long-term future at Spotify Camp Nou.\n\nRashford’s numbers this season have played a major role in the decision.\n\nIn 33 matches across all competitions, he has scored 10 goals and provided 13 assists.\n\nFurthermore, Barcelona view the €30 million fee as reasonable, especially compared to the huge sums often required for top attacking players.\n\nIn addition, Rashford has agreed to lower his salary compared to what he was earning at Manchester United, making the move easier to fit within the club’s wage structure.\n\nRight now, all signs point to a permanent transfer. If everything goes according to plan, Rashford will become a full Barcelona player at the end of the season.",

There were plays in training camp he made, the accuracy outside the pocket or on the move, the way he plays the position, he has an athletic nature to the way he plays. I think that's somewhat unique. Everybody has a different skill set, he's comfortable in the pocket, he has the ability to transfer up in the pocket, to make moves, to make throws off platform and at different angles.\"\n\nThe Patriots were 4-13 last year in Maye's rookie season, and although many expected them to improve in Vrabel's first year, few expected them to be in the Super Bowl.

Includes dynamically installable skillsets for Google \nservices, shell execution, file management, and task scheduling.\n\nThe Moltbot blueprint is a comprehensive personal AI automation agent that\nbrings the power of Moltbot/Clawdbot to the ChatBotKit platform. Unlike\nself-hosted alternatives that require managing infrastructure and security,\nthis blueprint provides all the automation capabilities in a secure, managed\nenvironment with enterprise-grade isolation.\n\nThe agent is accessible across four communication channels—Slack for work\nconversations, Telegram for secure personal messaging, WhatsApp for mobile\naccessibility, and Email for asynchronous communication. Users can interact\nwith their personal automation agent wherever they are, and conversations\nmaintain context across channels.\n\nAt the heart of this blueprint is a minimal-footprint main agent with just\ncore capabilities: skillset discovery, skillset installation, shell execution,\nand file management. Rather than loading all abilities upfront, the agent\ndiscovers available skillsets at runtime and installs only what's needed.\nThis pattern keeps the agent fast and focused while enabling unlimited\nexpansion.\n\nProactive Automation with Triggers\n\nFive scheduled triggers automate common workflows:\n\nAll shell commands run in isolated sandbox containers that are created\non-demand and destroyed after use. The agent has its own persistent Space\nfor storing scripts, automation outputs, and configuration files. Unlike\nself-hosted Moltbot which has full system access, this architecture\nensures even malicious code cannot escape the sandbox.\n\nGoogle services use personal OAuth secrets, meaning each user authenticates\nwith their own Google account. The agent never sees raw credentials—it\nreceives scoped access tokens that can only perform the permitted actions.\nThis provides true personal automation where your calendar, email, and\nfiles remain under your control.\n\nThis blueprint demonstrates advanced ChatBotKit patterns: multi-channel\ndeployment, dynamic skillset installation, personal OAuth, scheduled\ntriggers for proactive automation, and secure shell execution—all\ncombined into a practical personal automation assistant.\n\nCommon information about the bot's experience, skills and personality. \n\nThis example uses a dedicated Skillset. Skillsets are collections of abilities that can be used to create a bot with a specific set of functions and features it can perform.\n\nThis example uses Secrets to store sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and other credentials.\n\nThis blueprint can be deployed using Terraform, enabling infrastructure-as-code management of your ChatBotKit resources. Use the code below to recreate this example in your own environment.\n\nCopy this Terraform configuration to deploy the blueprint resources:\n\nLearn more about the Terraform provider\n\nA dedicated team of experts is available to help you create your perfect chatbot.

    "title": "A New AI Math Startup Just Cracked 4 Previously Unsolved Problems",
    "description": "Axiom says its AI found solutions to several long-standing math problems, a sign of the technology’s steadily advancing reasoning capabilities.",
    "fullText": "mathematicians Dawei Chen and Quentin Gendron were trying to untangle a difficult area of algebraic geometry involving differentials, elements of calculus used to measure distance along curved surfaces. While working on one theorem, they ran into an unexpected roadblock: Their argument depended on a strange formula from number theory, but they were unable to solve or justify it. In the end, Chen and Gendron wrote a paper presenting their idea as a conjecture, rather than a theorem.\n\nChen recently spent hours prompting ChatGPT in the hopes of getting the AI to come up with a solution to the still unsolved problem, but it wasn’t working. Then, during a reception at a math conference in Washington, DC, last month, Chen ran into Ken Ono, a well-known mathematician who had recently left his job at the University of Virginia to join Axiom, an artificial intelligence startup cofounded by one of his mentees, Carina Hong.\n\nChen told Ono about the problem, and the following morning, Ono presented him with a proof, courtesy of his startup’s math-solving AI, AxiomProver. “Everything fell into place naturally after that,” says Chen, who worked with Axiom to write up the proof, which has now been posted to arXiv, a public repository for academic papers.\n\nAxiom’s AI tool found a connection between the problem and a numerical phenomenon first studied in the 19th century. It then devised a proof, which it helpfully verified itself. “What AxiomProver found was something that all the humans had missed,” Ono tells WIRED.\n\nThe proof is one of several solutions to unsolved math problems that Axiom says its system has come up with in recent weeks. The AI has not yet solved any of the most famous (or lucrative) problems in the field of mathematics, but it has found answers to questions that have stumped experts in different areas for years. The proofs are evidence of AI’s steadily advancing math abilities. In recent months, other mathematicians have reported using AI tools to explore new ideas and solve existing problems.\n\nThe techniques being developed by Axiom may prove useful outside the world of advanced math. For example, the same approaches could be used to develop software that is more resilient to certain kinds of cybersecurity attacks. This would involve using AI to verify that code is provably reliable and trustworthy.\n\n“Math is really the great test ground and sandbox for reality,” says Hong, Axiom’s CEO. “We do believe that there are a lot of pretty important use cases of high commercial value.”\n\nAxiom’s approach involves combining large language models with a proprietary AI system called AxiomProver that is trained to reason through math problems to reach solutions that are provably correct. In 2024, Google demonstrated a similar idea with a system called AlphaProof. Hong says that AxiomSolver incorporates several significant advances and newer techniques.\n\nOno says the AI-generated proof for the Chen-Gendron conjecture shows how AI can now meaningfully assist professional mathematicians. “This is a new paradigm for proving theorems,” he says.\n\nAxiom’s system is more than just a regular AI model, in that it is able to verify proofs using a specialized mathematical language called Lean. Rather than just search through the literature, this allows AxiomProver to develop genuinely novel ways of solving problems.\n\nAnother one of the new proofs generated by AxiomProver demonstrates how the AI is capable of solving math problems entirely on its own. That proof, which has also been described in a paper posted to arXiv, provides a solution to Fel’s Conjecture, which concerns syzygies, or mathematical expressions where numbers line up in algebra. Remarkably, the conjecture involves formulas first found in the notebook of legendary Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan more than 100 years ago. In this case AxiomProver did not just fill in a missing piece of the puzzle, it devised the proof from start to finish.",

    "description": "How physically magnifying objects using a key ingredient in diapers has opened an unprecedented view of the microbial world.",
    "fullText": "When you slip a slide under a microscope, a system of glass lenses magnifies the object of your attention — a microbe, for example. But even with the largest zoom on a classic compound optical system, scientists struggle to make sense of finer details, which can be further obscured when tough cell walls make it difficult to inject dyes that help identify structures.\n\nNow, rather than invest in more powerful and more expensive technologies, some scientists are using an alternative technique called expansion microscopy, which inflates the subject using the same moisture-absorbing material found in diapers.\n\n“It’s cheap, it’s easy to learn, and indeed, on a cheap microscope, it gives you better images,” said Omaya Dudin, a cell biologist at the University of Geneva who studies multicellularity.\n\nExpansion microscopy was developed by Ed Boyden at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2015. Boyden and colleagues successfully expanded a biological sample by infusing it with a hydrogel made of sodium acrylate. A key ingredient layered in diapers to keep babies dry, the compound can absorb hundreds of times its weight in water while retaining its overall structure.\n\nIn expansion microscopy, specific biomolecules such as proteins are anchored to the gel. As the gel absorbs added water, its weblike matrix swells, and the space between the web’s anchor points dilates. Ideally, the overall structure remains, allowing researchers to visualize extra-tiny anatomy or see inside cells with tough barriers.\n\nDudin had spent six frustrating years trying to force antibodies through his target cells’ sturdy walls to bind to specific proteins and visualize their internal structures, and he was only able to do so through a complex freeze-and-thaw protocol that destroyed most of the final product. Desperate, he struck up a Covid-era collaboration with the lab next door that was using expansion microscopy.\n\n“That moment was just magical. All the cells were expanded, everything stained, we could see,” Dudin said. “It very rapidly became clear that we should aim for the sky with this one.”\n\nGautam Dey, a cell biologist at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg who studies mitosis, found that the method worked just as well in his lab. The samples were clearer, and the dyes and antibodies penetrated cells more effectively, so the two labs struck up a collaboration to visualize species they had never studied before. They are working to chart the landscape of cytoskeletal diversity, visualizing complex cytoskeletal structures that have never been seen in such detail.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, expansion microscopy is possible for any lab with a basic microscope and the hydrogel. “People have talked about democratizing microscopy before. This is it, it’s happening,” Dey said. “I think it’s just a matter of time before any cell biology lab in the world is doing it. A basic fluorescence microscope is never too far away.”",

    "title": "Vibe Migrating off SaaS >1k Pages and Losing 80% of our traffic",
    "description": "In 2026, we will replace most of our SaaS with vibe-coded solutions - Low/No-Code SaaS will die - startups are the canary in the coal mine.",
    "fullText": "As late as December 30th 2025, Hopsworks's website contained well over 1,000 pages. It was a mix of blogs, dictionary entries, videos, and various content types - but mostly, it was a pile of legacy pages and landing pages.\n\nAs of today, February 2026, thanks to tools like Claude Code, we have completely shifted our approach. Within a week, we have cut our page count in half, moved away from our legacy hosting and CMS, and essentially refactored the whole site. The result is a platform that is:\n\nBack in 2018, we chose Webflow as our hosting and CMS solution. Quite honestly, it proved to be exactly what we needed at the time. It was easy for non-technical users to maintain and made adding content easy. But, like everything else, this convenience came at a cost. Over time, we accumulated layers of legacy content and structural debt. We became highly dependent on their platform, meaning our entire library was hosted on their infrastructure with very little flexibility to move out.\n\nA few of us on the team grew to be avid - if not overly enthusiastic - users of Claude Code, not unlike a large portion of your favourite social media's front-page I am sure. And as our internal usage grew over the course of the year, a new paradigm emerged. As product owners, and marketeers, we realized we no longer wanted to spend time \"moving boxes\" in a UI. We wanted to alter and shape the code directly to output what we needed, often based on existing content.\n\nAnd so we realised over time that the handy low-code/UI-driven approach of Webflow became not quite so handy anymore. We wanted to change the code directly, not just tweak a component here and there. Dragging and dropping had simply become a drag that we wanted to drop (pun intended).\n\nWe made the jump in a single go. We pulled the whole website and its content library, asked Claude to parse it, created a skeleton using an open-source headless CMS, and migrated all content to Markdown We then re-created the frontend, partly based on the same UI library we use for our own software platform.\n\nTwo hours later, a functional, viable draft containing the entire content of the old website was online.\n\nIt took just two hours to rebuild, re-architect, and redeploy a functional website based on the 1,000 pages of the old one. It took a few more hours to set up proper redirects, SEO, polishes and debugs. It was a cathartic - albeit scary - experiment to think that we were about to essentially erase six years of a relationship with a toolset in a single afternoon.\n\nA new and unexpected benefit of this shift is the cultural change within the team. Moving even less technical team members toward a technical stack consisting of version control, IDEs, and CLIs forces them to engage with the tools that our engineering team uses every day.\n\nThis lowers the \"understanding gap\" between teams. Everyone is now speaking a more common language. While the depth of knowledge may differ, it provides a starting point for collaboration.\n\nSome of the benefits we actually found can be summed up in this table:\n\nGaining full control over our code also meant we could no longer blame anyone when things looked wrong. And things looked very wrong. It did seem like it didn't work, at all, a massive loss of 80% of the traffic was registering on all analytics.\n\nQuite honestly, it was a terrible couple of weeks wondering if that was just vibe coded slop, missing content during the migration, Google penalising us, SEO schemas not being set properly, redirects not working; you name it we thought about it all day every day. The inherent nature of traffic taking time to be impacted by changes also meant; we had to be sort of patient with our assumptions.\n\nUntil a few days ago, when we had a realization; when we rebuilt the website, we thought also to rebuild the analytics and how we were tracking users.\n\nIt turns out, with our previous setup. We were tracking more visitors than we intended to. What happened is that we were not storing user information if they did not accept our terms, and so they were anonymous to us, but there were no such mechanics for Google Analytics so Google tracked them anyway.\n\nNow, with the website being rebuilt. We followed best practices; accepting cookies would directly impact whether the website would be passing user information to Google and other third party analytical tools as well as ourselves. And so, it turns out, lots of users do not want to accept cookies, and it turns out, we do not send their information to Google; we do however, have set an internal cookieless analytical tool (self-hosted in EU & no IP collection) to indeed see the traffic on our site.\n\nSo we did not lose 80% of traffic. Sorry. We did not in fact lose much traffic at all (there was a drop post-migration that now seems to recover organically). We vibe coded best practices in passing, forgot about it, scared ourselves, spent a few weeks thinking that our whole plan was a terrible idea and that we should admit defeat. Turns out it is all good.\n\nWell, any other tools that have added debt, cost, and systemic weight to the organization with obvious ones like - CRMs, marketing automation, and such. If everything is just a table somewhere, and if everything can be created bespoke in a few hours, why pay tens of thousands of euros for it? We are doing the work of setting it up, managing the data, cleaning and integration with our ecosystem anyways. The value seems to be diminishing by the hour.\n\nDoes this imply that every software company must take a hard look at their value proposition and ask themselves: \"Are we at risk of becoming commodified by tooling such as Claude?\"...\n\nWe are ourselves a software company; we are builders, and we know that we also would either benefit or suffer from the very same question; a simple prompt such as \"Please create my own feature store and MLOps platform,\" where a few hours later, the organization has its own bespoke tool. So where to draw the line?\n\nIt sits at the runtime/engine/core. What gets commoditised is the setup, the glue, the configuration and orchestration layers; things you can prompt into existence. What doesn't is the core: the API, the execution engine, the years of production edge-cases baked into a platform. You can prompt your way into connecting a feature store, configuring it, deploying pipelines on top of it; but the platform that runs them reliably at scale is not a weekend project.\n\nSo, for us, this is exactly where we are going. We aim to apply that same lesson to our own very own software platform, making it something users can operate on and build upon at the speed they can prompt. This must be the new motto for startups. Business as usual is but a prompt away from being replaced.\n\nP.S. While writing this article, the following message was sent to a colleague:\n\nThe table you see above is now actual markdown, not an image. One down, a few more to go.",

    "description": "Agentic Engineering is a disciplined approach to AI-assisted software development that emphasizes human oversight and engineering rigor, distinguishing it fr...",
    "fullText": "A year ago, Andrej Karpathy coined “vibe coding” to describe a gleefully reckless way of programming: you prompt, hand the keyboard to an AI, accept everything it spits out, don’t read the diffs, iterate by pasting error messages back in. It was a great label for a real thing - building quick prototypes or MVPs on pure AI autopilot.\n\nThe problem is that “vibe coding” has become a suitcase term. People now use it to describe everything from a weekend hack to a disciplined engineering workflow where AI agents handle implementation under human oversight. These are fundamentally different activities, and conflating them is causing real confusion - and real damage.\n\nVibe coding means going with the vibes and not reviewing the code. That’s the defining characteristic. You prompt, you accept, you run it, you see if it works. If it doesn’t, you paste the error back and try again. You keep prompting. The human is a prompt DJ, not an engineer.\n\nIf vibe coding gives millions of people the ability to create custom software who otherwise couldn’t, that’s a genuine win. The technique has a legitimate place in the toolbox.\n\nBut the failure modes are well-documented at this point. The pattern is always the same: it demos great, then reality arrives. You try to modify it, scale it, or secure it, and you discover nobody understands what the code is actually doing. As one engineer put it, “This isn’t engineering, it’s hoping.”\n\nHere’s the thing: a lot of experienced engineers are now getting massive productivity gains from AI - 2x, 5x, sometimes more - while maintaining code quality. But the way they work looks nothing like vibe coding. They’re writing specs before prompting. They’re reviewing every diff. They’re running test suites. They’re treating the AI like a fast but unreliable junior developer who needs constant oversight. I’ve personally liked “AI-assisted engineering” and have talked about how this describes that end of the spectrum where the human remains in the loop.\n\nSimon Willison (whose work I adore) proposed “vibe engineering” for this - it reclaims “vibe” while adding “engineering” to signal discipline. But after watching the community debate this for months, I think the the word “vibe” carries too much baggage. It signals casualness. When you tell a CTO you’re “vibe engineering” their payment system, you can see the concern on their face.\n\nAndrej Karpathy suggested “agentic engineering” this week and I think I like it.\n\nIt describes what’s actually happening. You’re orchestrating AI agents - coding assistants that can execute, test, and refine code - while you act as architect, reviewer, and decision-maker. You might write only a % of the code by hand. The rest comes from agents working under your direction. That’s agentic. And you’re applying engineering discipline throughout. That’s engineering.\n\nIt’s professionally legible. “Agentic engineering” sounds like what it is: a serious engineering discipline involving autonomous agents. You can say it to your VP of Engineering without embarrassment. You can put it in a job description. You can build a team practice around it.\n\nIt draws a clean line. Vibe coding = YOLO. Agentic engineering = AI does the implementation, human owns the architecture, quality, and correctness. The terminology itself enforces the distinction.\n\nThe workflow isn’t complicated, but it requires discipline that vibe coding explicitly abandons:\n\nYou start with a plan. Before prompting anything, you write a design doc or spec - sometimes with AI assistance. You break the work into well-defined tasks. You decide on the architecture. This is the part vibe coders skip, and it’s exactly where projects go off the rails.\n\nYou direct, then review. You give the AI agent a well-scoped task from your plan. It generates code. You review that code with the same rigor you’d apply to a human teammate’s PR. If you can’t explain what a module does, it doesn’t go in.\n\nYou test relentlessly. The single biggest differentiator between agentic engineering and vibe coding is testing. With a solid test suite, an AI agent can iterate in a loop until tests pass, giving you high confidence in the result. Without tests, it’ll cheerfully declare “done” on broken code. Tests are how you turn an unreliable agent into a reliable system.\n\nYou own the codebase. You maintain documentation. You use version control and CI. You monitor production. The AI accelerates the work, but you’re responsible for the system.\n\nTeams doing this well often report faster development - and those gains come from augmenting a solid process, not abandoning one. The AI handles boilerplate and grunt work. The human focuses on architecture, correctness, edge cases, and long-term maintainability.\n\nThe irony is that AI-assisted development actually rewards good engineering practices more than traditional coding does. The better your specs, the better the AI’s output. The more comprehensive your tests, the more confidently you can delegate. The cleaner your architecture, the less the AI hallucinates weird abstractions. As one analysis noted, “AI didn’t cause the problem; skipping the design thinking did.”\n\nHere’s an uncomfortable truth from the trenches: agentic engineering disproportionately benefits senior engineers. If you have deep fundamentals - you understand system design, security patterns, performance tradeoffs - you can leverage AI as a massive force multiplier. You know what good code looks like, so you can efficiently review and correct AI output.\n\nBut if you’re junior and you lean on AI before building those fundamentals, you risk a dangerous skill atrophy. You can produce code without understanding it. You can ship features without learning why certain patterns exist. Several engineering leaders have flagged this as an emerging crisis: a generation of developers who can prompt but can’t debug, who can generate but can’t reason about what they’ve generated.\n\nThis isn’t an argument against AI-assisted development. It’s an argument for being honest about what it demands. Agentic engineering isn’t easier than traditional engineering - it’s a different kind of hard. You’re trading typing time for review time, implementation effort for orchestration skill, writing code for reading and evaluating code. The fundamentals matter more, not less.\n\nThe trajectory is clear: AI agents are getting more capable, and the agentic engineering workflow is becoming default for a growing number of professional developers. This is going to accelerate.\n\nThe rise of AI coding doesn’t replace the craft of software engineering - it raises the bar for it. The developers who’ll thrive aren’t the ones who prompt the fastest. They’re the ones who think the clearest about what they’re building and why, then use every tool available - including AI agents - to build it well.\n\nVibe coding showed us what’s possible when you drop all conventions.\n\nNow it’s time to bring the engineering back. Let’s call that what it is.\n\nI’ve written a new book with O’Reilly, Beyond Vibe Coding, that goes deeper into practical frameworks for AI-Assisted (and agentic) engineering. If you’ve been figuring this out in your own workflow, I’d love to hear what’s working.",

    "fullText": "A brutally cold weekend awaits more than 100 million people in the northeastern quarter of the nation as Arctic air lunges southward straight from eastern Canada. The initial blast of cold air will bring a burst of snow to some areas, followed by a rapid freeze-up and harsh, gusty winds.\n\nThe air will have little chance to warm on its southward journey, as the landscape is largely frozen, with vast areas of deep snow and frozen lakes and rivers. If, when the stats are tallied, this weekend does not officially bring the lowest temperatures of the winter, it will feel like it in many cases for a time.\n\nEnough wintry conditions will unfold to cause flight delays and cancellations, as well as slippery travel on area highways this weekend from the Midwest to the Northeast.\n\nIn most cases, the harshest part of the weekend will be the first half, when the bulk of the snow and wind will occur.\n\nThe snow will pivot from the Great Lakes region to the Appalachians during the day Friday. Some areas around the Great Lakes and the west-facing slopes of the Appalachians will pick up 1-3 inches of snow from the setup. The first part of the snowfall may occur with temperatures near or just above freezing. Then, as Arctic air blasts in, the snow will become more powdery, and wet, slushy areas will quickly freeze.\n\nThe amount of snow will tend to dwindle east of the Appalachians in the mid-Atlantic region. For some, there may just be a couple of snow showers that bring little or no accumulation, then it will get dry, windy and very cold.\n\nHowever, in parts of New England, an enhanced area of snow may form as a storm develops along the Arctic front as it nears the Atlantic, producing an inch or more on Saturday.\n\n\"It's possible there's a narrow zone where 4-5 inches of snow falls over southern and central New England on Saturday,\" AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said.\n\nTimeline of weather events in various cities\n\nIn Detroit, the Arctic front will bring bursts of snow from late Thursday night to Friday midday. After a morning high of 35 degrees Fahrenheit, temperatures will plunge through the 20s and into the teens, causing the 1-3 inches of snow and slush to freeze solid, creating difficult commutes on Friday. Temperatures will bottom out just above zero on Saturday morning and fight back to only the mid-teens Saturday afternoon, only to fall back to near zero Saturday night.\n\nFarther east, snow will begin in New York City Friday evening and continue at varying rates into the early hours of Saturday morning. On Friday night, temperatures will hover in the 20s, only to fall into the teens on Saturday during the day, despite a return of sunshine. Those heading into Manhattan for a Saturday show should brace for the dead-of-winter cold. Temperatures will bottom out in the single digits Saturday night and again Sunday night. The lowest temperature in New York City so far this winter was 9 degrees on a couple of occasions in the last week of January. Temperatures are forecast to dip lower than those on Sunday and Monday mornings.\n\nHave the app? Unlock AccuWeather Alerts™ with Premium+\n\nIn Boston, the snow will hold off until late Friday night, but Saturday is likely to be quite wintry with snow of varying intensity and temperatures plummeting into the teens in the afternoon and then to near zero Saturday night. After temperatures fight their way into the teens on Sunday, temperatures will slip back into the single digits on Sunday night. Temperatures are projected to dip below the season low mark of 5 F on Sunday morning.\n\nWicked winds, dangerously low AccuWeather RealFeel® Temperatures\n\n\"Not only will the air temperature plummet after the Arctic front moves through, but north-northwest winds with gusts of 35-55 mph will also occur, resulting in AccuWeather RealFeel® Temperatures falling to dangerously low levels,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Brandon Buckingham said. Actual temperatures will drop into the single digits or below zero across much of the Northeast.\n\nThose not properly dressed risk frostbite and hypothermia. Skiers, boarders and snowmobilers should be prepared for the extreme conditions.\n\nIn most cases, Sunday will end up being the less harsh of the two weekend days, with winds forecast to ease up in the afternoon. But temperatures will start the day at frigid levels. Only the February sun will offer some comfort during the midday and afternoon when cruising around in the car.\n\nIn the Northeast, temperatures will plummet Sunday evening in locations where the sky remains clear.\n\nTens of thousands were still without power in Tennessee and Mississippi as of early Thursday morning in the wake of a devastating ice storm nearly two weeks ago. Fortunately, this Arctic blast will not penetrate deeply into the Southern states and should stay north of the Florida Peninsula, which was recently hit hard by damaging freezes.\n\nOn Sunday, as warmer air begins to build over the northern Rockies and Plains, a batch of snow and spotty freezing rain or drizzle is likely to develop over the Great Lakes region and slide southeastward across parts of the Ohio Valley and the central Appalachians.\n\nThis same zone of slippery travel may reach part of the mid-Atlantic region Sunday night to Monday morning.\n\nFor those struggling with the relentless cold and bracing for high heating bills, there is some good news on the way for weeks two and three of February.\n\nWant next-level safety, ad-free?

    "fullText": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly dipped below $70,000 per token on Thursday after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the US government would not bail out the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn a heated back-and-forth during a House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, Bessent was asked if the US Treasury had the authority to buy bitcoin or other cryptos.\n\n\"I do not have the authority to do that, and as chair of FSOC, I do not have that authority,\" Bessent stated.\n\nBitcoin fell to as low as $69,936 apiece early Thursday, continuing the slump on Wednesday that followed Bessent's comments.\n\nThe decline was also fueled by the broader selling pressure in markets and a warning from notable investor Michael Burry that a sustained decline in bitcoin's price could \"set in motion a death spiral leading to massive value destruction.\"\n\nHow has Bitcoin performed in recent months?\n\nWhy did Bitcoin drop below $70,000 on Thursday?\n\nWhat did Treasury Secretary Bessent say about cryptocurrency?\n\nWhat technical factors are driving current crypto market weakness?\n\n\"Bitcoin has been exposed as a purely speculative asset, and is not near the debasement trade hedge that gold and other precious metals are,\" Burry, who rose to prominence after predicting the 2008 financial crisis, wrote in his Substack.\n\nThe move lower on Thursday only added to bitcoin's recent rout. The world's largest cryptocurrency is down nearly 20% year-to-date.\n\nBitcoin dropped sharply last weekend to notch its fourth straight month of losses.\n\nThe move lower coincided with President Trump's announcement last Friday selecting Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve when Jerome Powell's term ends in May, a nomination markets view as hawkish.\n\nEther (ETH-USD) and other digital tokens also slid.\n\nAfter bitcoin earlier broke through the key support level at $73,000, 10X Research strategists wrote that \"current flows suggest sentiment has shifted meaningfully.\"\n\nThe firm's strategists pointed to flow and positioning data, which indicated \"investors are not yet positioned to buy the dip.\"\n\n\"While sentiment and technical indicators are approaching extreme levels, the broader downtrend remains intact,\" the researchers wrote. \"In the absence of a clear catalyst, there is little urgency to step in.\"\n\nThe firm noted that traders remain focused on deleveraging and unwinding their positions rather than on preparing for a typical snapback rally.\n\nPressure on digital assets reflected the broader fragility across the crypto market.

    "fullText": "Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) says he does not support President Trump’s proposal for Republicans to “take over” voting procedures in more than a dozen states and “nationalize” the midterm elections, declaring the president’s call to action blatantly unconstitutional.\n\n“That’s not what the Constitution says about elections,” Paul said in an interview Tuesday with MS NOW’s Stephanie Ruhle, when asked about the president’s statement that Republicans “ought to nationalize the voting.”\n\nPaul noted the U.S. Supreme Court limits states in some ways, such as by barring them from setting different rules for some issues, including term limits. But he said the Constitution gives states the power to determine the time, place and matter of elections.\n\n“The Supreme Court did rule that, for example, Washington state can’t set term limits on federal officials if Georgia doesn’t. It has to be a uniform election law,” the Kentucky Republican said.\n\n“But as far as the time, place and manner of elections, that, under the Constitution, is a state activity,” he continued. “So, I’m not for nationalizing it.”\n\nPaul added that Democrats tried to implement sweeping national election reforms when former President Biden was in office, but that Republicans blocked in in the Senate.\n\n“I was against Nancy Pelosi’s bill, which would have nationalized it, but I would also be against any bill coming from this administration that would nationalize elections,” he said, referring to the Democratic former Speaker from California.\n\nTrump doubled down on his call for the GOP to “nationalize” voting Tuesday, despite efforts by the White House to soften his previous statements on the issue. He said the federal government should take a more active role in running elections to combat what he called “corruption.”\n\n“Look at some of the places — that horrible corruption on elections — and the federal government should not allow that,” the president said. “The federal government should get involved.”\n\nThose comments followed a statement he made to conservative commentator and former Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino in a podcast that aired Monday, in which he said Republicans should “take over” elections.\n\n“The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over,’” he said. “We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many — 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.”\n\nThose statements received pushback from several high-profile Republican lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.).\n\nThune told reporters that voters should be required to show identification to prove they are citizens but he does not support the federal government seizing the power to run elections.\n\n“I’m supportive of only citizens voting and showing ID at polling places,” he said. “I think that makes sense. … But I’m not favor of federalizing elections, no. I think that’s a constitutional issue.”\n\n“I’m a big believer in decentralized and distributed power,” the senator added. “And I think it’s harder to hack 50 election systems than it is to hack one. In my view, at least, that’s always a system that has worked pretty well.”",

    "title": "The Happiest Retirees Usually Have These 8 Things In Common",
    "description": "These are the things that the happiest retirees have in common.",
    "fullText": "My grandma lives in a group home, so I've talked to a lot of retirees over the time she's been there—some thriving, some struggling, some just coasting through. And the differences are crazy. The happiest ones aren't necessarily the ones with the most money or the fanciest vacations. They're the ones who built their retirement around certain principles, certain choices, certain ways of structuring their days and their lives. The people who are genuinely content in retirement tend to share specific traits and habits that the miserable ones don't.\n\nThey didn't retire to do nothing. Maybe it's volunteering, mentoring, working part-time on projects they actually care about, caring for grandkids, or diving into hobbies they never had time for before. According to research published in The Journals of Gerontology, retirees who report having a clear sense of purpose show significantly higher life satisfaction scores and lower rates of depression compared to those who view retirement primarily as cessation of work rather than transition to new activities. Whatever it is, they have a reason to get up in the morning that isn't tied to a paycheck. They're not just killing time—they're spending it intentionally. And that sense of direction, of still mattering in some capacity, makes retirement feel like a new chapter instead of an ending.\n\nWork provides built-in social interaction. Retirement takes that away, and a lot of people don't replace it. But the happy retirees do. They stay in touch with friends. They join groups, clubs, or classes. They make an effort to see people regularly instead of isolating at home.\n\nThey've realized that loneliness is one of the biggest threats to a good retirement, so they actively fight it. They schedule lunches, plan trips with friends, and show up to community events. They don't wait for social connection to come to them—they go find it. And that consistent human contact keeps them engaged, keeps them feeling connected to the world, keeps them from fading into irrelevance.\n\nThey're not running marathons or hitting the gym obsessively, but they're moving.\n\nWalking. Swimming. Gardening. Yoga. Something that keeps their body in motion on a regular basis. Findings from the American Journal of Preventive Medicine indicate that physical activity in retirement is one of the strongest predictors of both physical and mental well-being, with active retirees reporting better sleep quality, lower anxiety levels, and greater overall happiness than sedentary peers.\n\nThat movement doesn't just keep them healthy—it gives them energy. It improves their mood. It helps them sleep. It makes them feel capable instead of fragile. And the retirees who prioritize staying active tend to stay independent longer, which directly impacts their quality of life.\n\nSome structure is good. But the happiest retirees haven't replaced their work schedule with an equally rigid retirement schedule. They allow for spontaneity. They can take a nap if they're tired. They can spend three hours on a project that interests them without feeling guilty. They can say yes to last-minute plans without having to rearrange everything. That flexibility is part of what makes retirement appealing. They're not slaves to a calendar anymore. They have the freedom to follow their energy and their interests, and they actually use it.\n\nThey're not rich, necessarily. But they're not constantly stressed about money either. They've figured out what they can afford, adjusted their lifestyle accordingly, and stopped worrying about it. Studies on financial well-being in retirement show that perceived financial security matters more than absolute wealth, with retirees who feel their resources are adequate reporting higher happiness levels than wealthier peers who experience chronic money anxiety. They're not trying to keep up with anyone. They're not stretching themselves to maintain a lifestyle they can't sustain. They've accepted their budget and built a life within it. And that acceptance removes a huge source of stress that plagues retirees who are constantly anxious about whether they'll run out of money.\n\nRetirement didn't shut down their curiosity. They're still reading, taking classes, learning new skills, and exploring topics that interest them. Maybe it's history, or cooking, or a new language, or how to use technology better. Whatever it is, they're keeping their minds active.\n\nThey're not coasting on what they already know. They're still growing, still challenging themselves, still discovering. And that intellectual engagement keeps them sharp. It gives them things to talk about, things to think about, things to look forward to. It keeps them from stagnating.\n\nThey don't take things for granted.\n\nThey appreciate being healthy enough to do what they want. They're grateful for time with family. They notice small pleasures—a good meal, a sunny day, a conversation that made them laugh.\n\nResearch published in the Journal of Happiness Studies found that retirees who regularly practice gratitude—whether through journaling, reflection, or simply conscious acknowledgment—report measurably higher life satisfaction and lower rates of depression than those who don't engage in such practices.\n\nThat mindset shift, from focusing on what's missing to appreciating what's there, changes everything. It makes ordinary days feel richer. It reduces resentment and comparison. It turns retirement into something to be grateful for instead of something to endure.\n\nThe relationship that didn't work out.\n\nThe mistakes they made along the way.\n\nThey've accepted that those things happened, and they've moved on. They're not carrying bitterness or wishing they could go back and change things. That release creates space for contentment. They're not stuck in what could have been—they're focused on what is. And that present-moment focus, that willingness to accept their life as it unfolded instead of mourning some alternate version, allows them to actually enjoy retirement instead of spending it regretting the decades that came before.",

    "fullText": "Silver prices slumped as precious metals came under renewed pressure amid a broader market pullback.\n\nThe spot silver price was 9.2% lower around $80.05 per troy ounce at 2:27 a.m. ET on Thursday. Prices had dropped as much as 17% earlier in the session.\n\nThursday's slide erased two days of gains for the white metal, which plunged as much as 36% on Friday at the height of the selloff.\n\nThe drop marks a sharp reversal for a market that had been on a tear just days earlier, with silver hitting a record high above $121 per ounce last week.\n\nGold also retreated, slipping below the $5,000 level to trade around $4,934 per ounce.\n\nPrices of the precious metals came amid a rise in the US Dollar Index to a two-week high, which makes dollar-denominated commodities pricier.\n\n\"The inverse relationship between precious metals and the US dollar has reasserted itself, leaving gold and silver particularly sensitive to near-term FX moves,\" wrote Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at ING on Tuesday.\n\n\"Looking ahead, the dollar is likely to remain a key driver of short-term price action, with precious metals broadly moving in the opposite direction,\" she added.\n\nAnalysts warn that silver is likely to remain especially volatile, as the market is far smaller than gold — a dynamic that can amplify price swings.\n\nEven before Friday's selloff, hedge funds had already been trimming long positions in silver and other metals, with managed money reducing exposure to surging metals and reallocating into energy and other commodities.\n\nIn other corners of the market, risk assets more broadly were under pressure, with tech stocks and cryptocurrencies sliding in choppy trading.\n\nSoftware stocks came under pressure this week after Anthropic unveiled a new AI tool capable of handling clerical and administrative work in the legal sector. Legal software companies bore the brunt of the initial selloff, before losses rippled through the wider software space.\n\n\"In addition to accelerating layoffs of jobs replaced by AI solutions, software continues to sell off as advances in quick AI solutions threaten all but those players with major moats around their client relationships,\" wrote Louis Navellier at Navellier & Associates on Wednesday.\n\nStephen Parker, co-head of global investment strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank, told CNBC on Wednesday that the tech selloff reflects a healthy rotation, with investors pivoting away from a tech-driven market in search of better opportunities elsewhere.\n\nThe tech selloff spilled over into Asia with tech stocks. On Thursday, Samsung Electronics and SoftBank Group Corp. falling by 6% and 7% respectively.\n\nBitcoin was trading around $71,200, down roughly 7% over the past 24 hours and about 19% lower over the last seven days.",

    "description": "Taco Bell CEO Sean Tresvant told Business Insider that the chain's advantage lies in strong value perception, menu innovation, and customer loyalty.",
    "fullText": "Taco Bell CEO Sean Tresvant has a simple explanation for why his brand keeps winning while much of the fast-food industry is struggling: it's doing more than one thing well at once.\n\n\"When you look at being a buzzy brand, you look at value, you look at digital, you look at category entry points and innovation, and all those things are working in concert with each other,\" Tresvant told Business Insider. \"Other brands can do one or two. When we do it, we get all four right, and we're very good in each part of that magic formula.\"\n\nYum! Brands, Taco Bell's parent company, announced during its earnings report on Wednesday that the Mexican-inspired chain delivered 7% same-store sales growth in the fourth quarter, far outpacing the rest of the segment as consumers continue to pull back on dining out.\n\nWhile much of the fast-food industry is grappling with slowing traffic as customers watch their wallets, Taco Bell's growth was driven by bigger-ticket transactions, especially among younger diners, even as competitors relied heavily on discounting.\n\nFoot-traffic data backs that up. A Placer.ai analysis of Yum Brands' fourth-quarter performance found that Taco Bell locations held up better than many quick-service competitors during key value-driven periods, even as broader fast-food visits softened amid inflation fatigue.\n\nTresvant says Taco Bell's advantage comes from combining the things competitors often struggle to balance: offering consistently good value rather than short-term deals, rapid-fire menu innovation, and a growing loyalty program that's actually driving incremental visits. That formula, he told Business Insider, has allowed Taco Bell to keep growing traffic and relevance \"in any environment,\" even as other fast-food brands fight simply to stay flat.\n\nTaco Bell's numbers reflect its loyalty push. Tresvant said active loyalty members climbed 31% in the fourth quarter, while digital channels grew 29%, as app-exclusive drops and rewards nudged customers to visit more often. Tresvant said the goal isn't just engagement, but turning loyalty into repeat traffic — which keeps the brand resilient.\n\nAlthough value-focused options now make up 17% of Taco Bell's menu, like its $5, $7, and $9 bundle offerings, what especially appeals to Taco Bell consumers is its pace of menu innovation — even when they're full price. From the return of its Quesarito and recent launch of its sauce collaboration with Frank's RedHot, to limited-time beverage offerings at its Live Más Café locations, every new rollout, Tresvant said, is \"determined on consumer needs and wants.\"\n\nAcross the restaurant industry, traditional quick-service strategies aren't working as they once did because of the uneven pressure of the K-shaped economy, where lower-income consumers have pulled back on dining out while higher-income spending remains stable.\n\nMany chains have leaned hard into deep discounting and short-term deals to lure customers back, but analysts and industry executives warn that constant promotions can erode pricing power and fail to drive meaningful traffic growth.\n\nAt the same time, competitors like Chipotle are recalibrating for smaller, wealthier consumer segments, underscoring how uneven the recovery has been across the sector.\n\nThat's not the strategy for Taco Bell. Instead of narrowing its focus, the chain has leaned on loyalty perks and app-exclusive offers to keep a broad range of customers coming back — particularly younger diners who are more likely to engage digitally even as they cut costs elsewhere.\n\n\"We continue to innovate on the menu, but not only on the menu,\" Tresvant added. \"We're going to make sure we're innovating from a guest hospitality standpoint, we're going to innovate in operations and innovate around the brand, not just in food.\"\n\nThat means continued exploration of voice AI ordering systems, which are being tested at 600 Taco Bell locations, as well as other efficiency-optimizing technologies to streamline back-of-house operations and improve the guest experience.\n\nIt also means giving consumers new ways to stay connected to the Taco Bell brand, like its Y2K-era cross-brand collaboration with Hollister, which sold out late last year.\n\nFor Tresvant, that momentum has created rare room to experiment at a time when much of the fast-food industry is still focused on defense.\n\n\"The things we're doing are working, and that just gives us a little bit of permission to take big swings in 2026,\" Tresvant said.",

    "title": "Software ate the world. Now AI is eating software.",
    "description": "What was once a stable and profitable tech business now faces an existential question: What happens if AI tools and agents replace business software?",
    "fullText": "In 2011, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen declared \"software is eating the world.\" Today, AI is beginning to devour software.\n\nInstead of helping the industry improve, new AI tools and agents could end up replacing some software products entirely.\n\nThis anxiety crystallized in recent weeks with three developments: Anthropic's release of a new autonomous AI agent called Cowork, the launch of industry-specific Cowork plugins, and the rise of OpenClaw, an open-source AI assistant spreading rapidly through messaging apps.\n\n\"Is this the end for software?\" Raimo Lenshow, a veteran tech analyst at Barclays, wrote in a recent note to investors. \"The current situation in software feels very unique with the large overhang of how AI will impact the space in the long-run.\"\n\nToday, companies get stuff done through a complex collection of different software services that help them wrangle data, track financials, sell products, and manage employees, customers, supply chains, and contracts. (If you've ever had to login to Workday, you'll know what I mean).\n\nGenerative AI is a threat to these applications in two main ways. First, if employees get more efficient using AI tools, companies may not need to buy as many business software subscriptions. That would dent the growth of \"seats,\" or how many subscriptions software companies sell. Each employee has a seat, so if there's no new hiring, growth stalls.\n\nThe second threat is more existential. If AI tools and AI agents get good enough, companies could replace the software they use entirely and instead rely on new AI-powered workflows. And with AI coding tools showing big improvements lately, companies could even develop their own software, without needing to buy it from established vendors.\n\nThis is why Anthropic's recent announcements have hit the software sector so hard.\n\nAnthropic's Cowork marks a clear step beyond chatbots. Instead of simply answering questions, Cowork can plan and execute multi-step tasks on a user's computer. Users can grant it access to folders, files, and applications, allowing the AI to clean up documents, build spreadsheets and slide decks, analyze data, automate workflows, and even log into web apps to collect information.\n\nBarclays analysts described Cowork as closer to what Microsoft originally envisioned for Copilot—a true digital worker—but with far greater autonomy. Microsoft shares are down about 12% in the past week or so.\n\nCowork is designed for non-technical and semi-technical users, such as marketers, project managers, and finance professionals, who can direct it using plain English. That matters because it weakens the traditional value proposition of many SaaS tools. If an AI agent can organize files, generate reports, build dashboards, and automate routine workflows on demand, the need for a dedicated, single-purpose application starts to look less obvious.\n\nThe threat became more concrete when Anthropic followed up by launching plugins for Cowork this week. These plugins effectively turn the AI into a specialist for roles like sales, finance, legal, marketing, and customer support, connecting it directly to internal data sources and tools. Anthropic even open-sourced a starter set of plugins, signaling an ecosystem approach rather than a closed product.\n\n\"This is another front-of-mind example of an AI tool lowering the barrier to entry, gaining traction, and disrupting incumbent workflows,\" said Michelle Miller, co-head of the Enterprise Software Technology group at consulting firm AlixPartners.\n\nFor years, companies bought software because building it themselves was too slow and expensive. Generative AI is flipping that equation. Tools like Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI-powered coding assistants, and products from StackBlitz, Replit, and others allow non-engineers to create custom tools with relatively simple English language prompts.\n\nNetlify CEO Matt Biilmann has said his own employees have used AI to build internal replacements for SaaS products like survey and quoting tools. Venture capitalist Martin Casado has described building a personal CRM with AI because it was easier than learning a complex off-the-shelf product. Salesforce, the leading CRM software vendor, is down about 40% in the past year.\n\nStackblitz CEO Eric Simons said his startup has created in-house AI agents for many workflows, including business intelligence, data analysis, coding, product development, customer support, and outbound sales.\n\n\"As a result, there are many SaaS vendors we would have likely previously used that are no longer relevant,\" he told Business Insider.\n\n\"The industry is waking up to the fact that AI is becoming extremely good at creating software autonomously,\" he added. \"This brings questions around what 'moats' exist for incumbent companies that are not themselves frontier AI labs.\"\n\nThis shift is especially dangerous for mid-sized SaaS companies. According to AlixPartners, they're being squeezed between nimble AI-native startups on one side and tech giants bundling AI into existing platforms on the other. Enterprise buyers, under pressure to cut costs, are increasingly asking why they need five tools when one AI tool or agent can do some, or most, of the work.\n\nPricing adds another layer of tension. AI systems are expensive to run, making traditional per-seat pricing harder to justify. Companies like ServiceNow are experimenting with hybrid and usage-based models. CEO Bill McDermott has insisted AI isn't hurting results, but investors remain skeptical. ServiceNow shares have plunged 25% in the past month.\n\nIf Cowork represents a top-down push from a well-funded AI lab, OpenClaw, formerly called Moltbot, shows how disruption can also come from the bottom up.\n\nCreated as a personal project and released as open source, OpenClaw is a messaging-first AI assistant that works inside platforms like WhatsApp, Slack, and iMessage. Relying heavily on Anthropic's Claude models, OpenClaw remembers context, proactively nudges users, and can automate tasks using browser actions, scripts, and scheduled jobs. After a month or so of relative obscurity, it went viral in late January.\n\nWhat caught investors' attention wasn't just OpenClaw's popularity, but what it represents. Instead of logging into multiple apps, users interact with an AI agent in a chat window and let it orchestrate tasks behind the scenes. In effect, the interface becomes conversation, not software menus.\n\nBarclays analysts noted that OpenClaw's underlying \"gateway,\" which routes tasks between agents and tools, resembles the orchestration layer that many enterprise software vendors are now racing to build.\n\nThe difference is that OpenClaw is free, open source, and user-controlled — a worrying combination for software incumbents that rely on expensive licenses. It's also a potential problem because the direct user relationship is now controlled by OpenClaw, not software providers.\n\nNone of this means software is disappearing overnight. Core systems of record — databases, payroll systems, accounting ledgers — remain deeply embedded in corporate operations. But the layers around them are becoming fluid. Dashboards, workflows, reports, and even entire applications can now be generated and used on the fly by AI agents.\n\nFor SaaS companies, the message is stark. Adapt by embracing agents, flexible pricing, and AI-native design — or risk becoming the next thing AI consumes.\n\n\"AI is forcing change across software development, AI governance and data security, go-to-market operations, pricing models, valuation frameworks, and business structure,\" AlixPartners' Miller said. \"Software companies mastering these transitions will define the winners in the next era, and those unable to adapt will be sidelined as industry fundamentals are redrawn.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Senate lawmakers questioned executives from Tesla and Waymo, and grilled Waymo's chief safety officer over Chinese cars and foreign workers.",
    "fullText": "What started as a policy hearing on self-driving cars turned tense for Waymo.\n\nLawmakers on Wednesday accused the robotaxi company of relying too heavily on Chinese vehicles and offshore labor, leading to a tense back-and-forth during a two-hour Senate hearing.\n\nAfter autonomous vehicle executives said earlier in the hearing that US companies risk falling behind Chinese rivals, senators flipped that back on Waymo's chief safety officer, Mauricio Peña.\n\n\"You said in your testimony that we're locked in a race with China, but it seems like you're getting in bed with China,\" Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio said, pointing to Waymo's plans to use vehicles made by a subsidiary of Geely, a Chinese automaker.\n\nPeña said the Alphabet-owned company uses a mix of platforms, but Moreno pushed back, questioning if Waymo was using a \"backdoor\" to sidestep the federal \"connected vehicle\" rule, which restricts foreign-linked technology in sensitive systems.\n\nUnder US rules finalized last year, vehicles with certain autonomous or connected software tied to China will face import restrictions, though key provisions are not yet fully in effect.\n\nWaymo first partnered with Zeekr, a Chinese automaker owned by Geely, in 2021. Since then, the company has spent several years adapting and testing a minivan-style vehicle built by Zeekr for its robotaxi program.\n\nA Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch last month that it will rename the Zeekr robotaxi to Ojai, citing concerns that the US public may be unfamiliar with the Zeekr brand.\n\nPeña said the Chinese-made cars have \"no connectivity\" and that the driving system is installed in the US. He added that tapping a broader global supply chain helps the company scale faster and remain resilient.\n\nMoreno wasn't buying it. \"Giving a natural market to a Chinese company to ship us cars is making us better and creating more jobs for Americans? That's completely ridiculous,\" he said.\n\nOn overseas labor, Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts called Waymo's use of remote human operators in countries outside the US \"completely unacceptable.\"\n\nPeña said that while some operators are located in the US, others work abroad, including in the Philippines. These operators typically step in when robotaxis encounter unusual situations.\n\n\"Having people overseas influencing American vehicles is a safety issue,\" Markey said. He warned that these workers may need to react \"in a split second\" during dangerous scenarios, yet are located overseas.\n\nMarkey also tied the issue to jobs, saying that Waymo is moving some roles overseas while developing technology that could replace US taxi and ride-hailing drivers.\n\nEarlier in the hearing, Waymo and Tesla executives framed autonomous vehicles as a race the US cannot afford to lose.\n\nWaymo warned that Chinese companies could set global standards for self-driving technology if Washington fails to act by setting regulations that could help companies move fast.\n\n\"We are locked in a race with Chinese companies for the future of autonomous vehicles,\" Peña told lawmakers, adding that without a clear national framework, the US risks a \"fragmented landscape of state regulations\" that slows investment and limits access.\n\n\"For America to lead in AV technology, we must modernize regulations that inhibit the industry's ability to innovate,\" said Lars Moravy, Tesla's vice president of vehicle engineering, referring to autonomous vehicle technology.\n\n\"Federal regulations for vehicles have not kept up with the pace of the rapid evolution of technology. Many standards were implemented decades ago and do not adequately address modern advancements,\" he added.\n\nIndustry leaders have repeatedly warned about China's lead in the EV market.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley said in an episode of The Verge's \"Decoder\" podcast that \"the Chinese are the 700-pound gorilla in the EV industry.\"\n\n\"There's no real competition from Tesla, GM, or Ford with what we've seen from China. It is completely dominating the EV landscape globally and more and more outside of China,\" he said in September.",

    "description": "A single mom juggling multiple jobs, grad school, and rising costs explains what it takes to stay in New York City — and why she may have to leave.",
    "fullText": "Massiel Lugo hit the New York lottery — and it's why she can afford to stay in the city she grew up in.\n\nThe 33-year-old single mother of two took over her aunt's lease in Jackson Heights, Queens, when her second child was born. Moving into the two-bedroom was only possible because her aunt, also a single mother, left the city for a more affordable life in Georgia.\n\n\"I remember watching her struggle a lot, and then she could no longer do it on her own, and she just got up and left,\" Lugo said.\n\nWhile Lugo's apartment isn't rent-stabilized, she inherited a six-year-old lease, and her landlord has held off on raising her rent to market rate, which is around $2,900 for the typical two-bedroom in the area. Still, the Queens native wonders if she should follow in her aunt's footsteps and leave the city.\n\nWhen her son's father moved out about five years ago, Lugo sublet her second bedroom and skipped meals to make ends meet. These days, she manages to pay her $1,700 rent by juggling multiple jobs while going to school. It helps that her 16-year-old daughter, Jalene, has taken paid internships, and her parents, who live four blocks away, help care for her eight-year-old son, Ozzie, who has autism.\n\nBut the city that's always been home is feeling increasingly hostile. A growing share of New Yorkers are struggling to afford life in one of the most expensive cities in the world as the costs of basic necessities like housing, groceries, and childcare soar. For decades, the city has failed to build enough new homes, creating a severe shortage that's driven up rents and home prices. Family-sized apartments with two or three bedrooms are especially hard to come by. The cost crisis is pushing many out of the city, particularly families with young children and lower-income Black and Hispanic residents.\n\nNew York City's new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, got elected on a pledge to bring these costs down. In January, he and Gov. Kathy Hochul rolled out their plan to significantly expand free and low-cost childcare for young children. Lugo was invited by the mayor's team to an event celebrating the announcement. While she supports the efforts, her kids are too old to benefit from them. Lugo and her family could see cost savings through other mayoral proposals, including free buses, city-owned grocery stores, and more affordable housing.\n\nLugo is among the more than 40% of the city's renters who spend more than a third of their gross income on housing. Her traditionally working-class immigrant neighborhood is under pressure from gentrification and the rising cost of living. At the same time, the streets and subways don't feel as safe as they did when Lugo was growing up.\n\n\"It's a love-hate relationship with New York,\" she said. \"At the end of the day, it's home, but it has changed so much.\"\n\nFor the last several years, Lugo worked both as a teacher's assistant in a public school and as a therapist for children with autism while earning her bachelor's degree. In January, she started a master's program to become a certified therapist for autistic children.\n\nOver the last few years, she's pieced together between $50,000 and $60,000 in income from her jobs and monthly child support. However, she's working less this semester to make more time for graduate school, which costs her $1,300 per semester. Eventually, she hopes to make upwards of $80,000 as a full-time certified therapist.\n\nIn the meantime, her income is barely enough to cover her family's expenses. Transportation and grocery costs have ballooned. Food costs in New York City rose by about 68% between 2013 and 2023 — much more than the national average of 49%, the state comptroller found. Lugo is an ALICE, which stands for asset-limited, income-constrained, employed, and describes someone who makes too much to qualify for most assistance, but still struggles to get by. She no longer gets food stamps, and her grocery bills have ballooned as her kids have gotten older.\n\n\"I buy food, and it's just gone,\" she said. \"I never thought I would yell at my kids, like, 'Did you guys really just finish all the juice boxes in a day?'\"\n\nDespite living a block from the 7 subway train and multiple bus lines, Lugo said she's increasingly found herself taking Ubers, in part because Ozzie is sensitive to the noise on public transit. It helps that Jalene rides transit for free because she's a public school student, and Ozzie takes a city-provided school bus because of his diagnosis.\n\nShe's also racked up about $7,000 in credit card debt by treating her kids to occasional meals out and new clothes. She was late on her rent payment last month after putting more money toward paying down her credit card.\n\n\"I used to be really good at saving, but my mindset has changed a lot. I'm just like, what am I saving up for?\" she said. \"I want to travel, I want to make memories with my kids, and that's become more of a priority for me.\"\n\nWhen Lugo's parents first moved to Queens from the Dominican Republic about 45 years ago, life was affordable for them, Lugo said. Some of her aunts and uncles were even able to buy co-ops in the area.\n\nBut the neighborhood has gentrified. Lugo remembers when the first Starbucks opened up in Jackson Heights in 2008 — it felt like a turning point. A few years ago, her father closed the bodega he owned for decades when the building was sold to a developer. The neighborhood has felt less safe in recent years, she said, with a rise in illegal brothels and disorder on the streets.\n\nLugo isn't ready to leave the city, but she'd like to raise her kids in a quieter neighborhood. She dreams of moving to Bayside, a wealthier, more suburban part of Queens, but rent and transportation costs out there would be even higher. She thinks that finding any other apartment similar in price and size to her own would be nearly impossible in the city.\n\nJalene has her sights set on Yale and wants to eventually become a lawyer. Lugo has told her she can only move away for college if she gets a full ride.\n\n\"I tell her, 'I want you to live your life. I want you to be a child, but you need to work extremely hard, because a studio is $2,000 right now. I can only imagine how much your generation is going to have to pay in the future,'\" Lugo said.",

    "title": "Anthropic's latest AI tool was seen by the legal software industry as a 'shot across the bow.' Here's what it means.",
    "description": "A new plugin from the AI startup has sent legal tech into a spin, sparking debate across the industry.",
    "fullText": "A new tool from Anthropic is stoking debate over whether AI will replace existing software that has dominated the legal sector for years.\n\nThe release of Anthropic's Cowork legal plugin sparked a steep sell-off in legal software stocks. Shares of Thomson Reuters and RLEX, makers of legal software, dropped about 15% each on Tuesday. Both stocks recovered slightly on Wednesday, though they remain fervently in the red for the week.\n\nThe slump isn't really about one Claude plugin. It pokes at a deeper question: If AI models become good enough for lawyers, will anyone need traditional legal software?\n\nOn one side are the two companies that have ruled legal tech for decades: Thomson Reuters and LexisNexis. They argue that lawyers will keep buying their software tools because their AI features are grounded in a walled garden of vetted case law, statutes, and editorial content. They claim less hallucination risk and fewer career-ending mistakes.\n\nOn the other side are the fast-rising startups, such as Harvey and Legora, and foundation model companies. They're betting lawyers will accept — or learn to manage — more risk in exchange for speed, flexibility, and tools that feel closer to a true \"virtual associate\" than a smarter search box.\n\nThis week's market reaction suggests investors are starting to price in an uncomfortable possibility: a new wave of competitors is finally pushing into a corner of the legal market that hasn't faced a real challenger in decades.\n\nAnalysts at William Blair & Co. wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that Anthropic's entry into the legal market brings \"a structural concern\" about the relevancy and \"moats of information services names under this new AI paradigm.\"\n\nIf you work in legal, it was hard to open LinkedIn over the past 24 hours without running into a wall of hot takes about Anthropic's new plugin.\n\nOne legal-tech startup employee described it to Business Insider as \"the Claude announcement that launched 1,000 ships.\"\n\nZachary Amron, deputy general counsel at the tech company Valon, said it's only a matter of time before Anthropic ships more legal-specific tools. Anthropic has not said publicly if it plans to go deeper in legal.\n\nNot everyone in legal tech is panicking. At GC AI, a startup that builds software for in-house legal teams rather than law firms, the mood was closer to a shrug.\n\nIn an internal memo seen by Business Insider, founder Cecilia Ziniti told employees that Anthropic's legal plugin was \"very raw and not a threat to us.\"\n\nZiniti's broader point was that foundation models may be powerful, but they're still just infrastructure. \"Claude gives people a great engine,\" she wrote. \"We already have one in our car. But does that suddenly mean everyone is going to assemble their own cars in their garage? Do you change your own oil? No.\"\n\nThe analogy mirrors a familiar pattern in tech. Amazon Web Services offers services that are similar to those sold by software companies, including many software-as-a-service companies that run on AWS's cloud. And yet, the specialized software vendors are often still more popular. Trust and experience still command a premium.\n\nZiniti sounded unbothered about Anthropic's impact on her own business. She was less charitable about the outcome for legacy vendors, and said the sell-off in Thomson Reuters and RLEX made sense to her.\n\n\"They make horses,\" she wrote. \"The tech now is cars.\"\n\nOthers saw the Anthropic launch less as a threat than as a demand generator.\n\nLogan Brown, a former Cooley lawyer who now runs a company, Soxton, that provides legal services to startups, said interest in her business spiked almost immediately after Anthropic's legal plugin dropped. She described a deluge of LinkedIn messages from investors betting her company would be among the survivors, because, Brown said, it serves founders, not lawyers, who don't want to gamble on legal paperwork.\n\nSome lawyers are stress-testing Anthropic's Claude chatbot in their day-to-day work.\n\nAmron, the Valon in-house lawyer, said he was already using Claude to assist with contract review. He vibe-coded a skill that compares versions of an agreement, drops the changes into a chart, and flags whether each revision helps or hurts the company.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Amron asked Claude to demo the new legal plugin for him. It generated a mock contract and walked through how it would review it.\n\nWhen the lawyer skimmed the underlying code, he noticed the system tried to pull information from Wikipedia. He wasn't impressed.\n\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter via email at mrussell@businessinsider.com or Signal at @MeliaRussell.01. Use a personal email address and a non-work device.

    "description": "Mark Zuckerberg published a playlist of five songs he was pumping while building Facebook in 2004. It includes hard-rocking hits and some synth funk.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg is feeling nostalgic.\n\nOn the 22nd anniversary of Facebook's founding, Zuckerberg reposted a meme about the fresh-faced Harvard student \"getting ready to make history.\" Then he linked a playlist titled \"2004 Facebook coding jams.\"\n\nZuckerberg said he \"had these bangers on repeat\" while building Facebook. The playlist's cover features the young founder — long before his bulked-up rebrand — listening to music on headphones.\n\nThe playlist's five songs feature a fair share of emo wails, electric guitars, and even some funky synthesizers. Some of them have receded into the tides of music history; others remain classics for weddings and bar mitzvahs.\n\nThey're also evocative of a quieter, easier time in tech. There were no culture wars, cage matches, or capex worries. What would a 2004 Zuckerberg think of $10 billion data centers?\n\nMusic speaks to how we feel. Here's what these five songs might say about a 19-year-old Zuckerberg — and just how far he's come.\n\nZuckerberg liked hard rock, it seems.\n\n\"Headstrong\" is a loud, thrashing song that feels built to be played on \"Guitar Hero.\" There's even a good guttural scream in there before one chorus. The lyrics are equally attacking. \"Back off, I'll take you on,\" Chris Taylor Brown sings.\n\nThe opening of \"Headstrong\" sounds like UFC walkout music, hyping up a big fight. That's now a favorite sport of Zuckerberg's. Some things never change.\n\n\"Like a Stone\" is about death and religion — two subjects that Zuckerberg has long been interested in.\n\nFrontman Chris Cornell prays to God and angels on their deathbed that they will get into heaven. \"In dreams until my death / I will wander on,\" he sings.\n\nZuckerberg seems more interested in extending human life than forecasting its end. His philanthropic initiative invests heavily in drug and disease research. He also has an intense fitness routine, including jiu-jitsu and CrossFit routines.\n\nAs for faith, Zuckerberg said in 2020 that he had \"become more religious.\" He cited two sources: The issues his company has faced in the prior years and the birth of his daughters.\n\nMostly, though, \"Like A Stone\" is another huge rock hit. It seems like Zuckerberg enjoyed the sound of banging drums and wailing guitar.\n\nNow this one is a nostalgia trip.\n\nYou can't help but feel something when Douglas Robb croons out, \"I'm not a perfect person.\" Was Zuckerberg a perfect person? Most people who have watched \"The Social Network\" would say no.\n\nIt's a romantic song. After considering their flaws, Robb sings out that they've found a reason to change. \"The reason is you,\" he repeats, over and over.\n\nZuckerberg met his wife, Priscilla Chan, in 2003, one year before this playlist's date. Maybe he was thinking of her.\n\nHe'd be less happy to hear that the song reemerged on TikTok — a Meta competitor — in a 2021 trend.\n\nWe all knew that Zuckerberg liked rap. He recorded his own version of T-Pain's \"Get Low\" in tribute to his wife. He also started dressing like Eminem.\n\n\"In the End\" is peak 2010s emo rap-rock. One of its refrains is \"I tried so hard.\" Zuckerberg did try so hard — he often worked till late into the night.\n\nThe song is more pessimistic in its outlook: \"In the end, it doesn't even matter.\" Zuckerberg would likely disagree here. He tried so hard — and in the end, it did matter. Meta is now a trillion-dollar company.\n\nHard pivot! After four hard rock tunes, Zuckerberg's last song leans into synth-funk.\n\nThe lyrics here feel self-explanatory for Zuckerberg's workplace ethos: \"Work it harder, make it better / Do it faster, makes us stronger / More than ever, hour after hour / Work is never over.\"\n\nAfter Meta's year of intensity, I'm sure that some of Zuckerberg's employees can relate.\n\nAlso, the Daft Punk helmet doesn't look that different from a Meta Quest.",

    "description": "Elliott Waehner moved with his wife and son from the US to Canada two years ago. He shares the biggest lessons he learned about the moving process.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Elliott Waehner, a 37-year-old graphic designer based in Calgary. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nMy wife, son, and I arrived in Canada in October 2023, but we started playing around with the idea of moving from Texas at the beginning of that year.\n\nMy wife and I are transgender, and as things started occurring that made it clear life in the US could continue getting worse for trans people, we decided to expedite our moving process. Two years later, we're living in Calgary, and it's still the best decision I've ever made.\n\nThe people I've met here have been welcoming to my trans identity, and I don't send my son to school worried about the threat of a school shooting. Moving was a difficult process, but here's what we did right, and here's what I wish I knew about the moving process sooner.\n\nThe first correct step we took, which I would advise anyone to do, is to schedule a one-time consultation with a licensed immigration consultant in Canada.\n\nWe scheduled a one-off, but you can work with them longer term. I told the consultant our plan, which at the time was to come in through permanent residency, thinking there was a pathway for teachers like my wife and me. The consultant asked if either of us wanted to go back to school, as that would be the most expeditious and attainable avenue for us to move.\n\nLuckily, I had already been planning on going back to school to pivot from education to graphic design, so we moved forward with that plan.\n\nA short meeting with one of these experts costs about a hundred bucks, but it's one of the best $100 spent because it helped guide us in the right direction in what can be a very complicated process.\n\nThe consultant's guidance affected what provinces we decided to look at, because at the time, only Alberta, Saskatchewan, or Nova Scotia would allow me to come in on a student visa and have my wife get an automatic open work permit.\n\nWe originally wanted to move to Ontario, and we didn't know that wasn't an option until our immigration consultant told us.\n\nWe decided on Alberta out of our three options because if we were going to be starting over somewhere, we wanted to be in the largest economy possible to have the most job opportunities. My wife worked as a private tutor while I attended Southern Alberta Institute of Technology for graphic design on a student visa.\n\nI'm really glad it happened that way because I really love Calgary.\n\nI found the list of documents I'd need on the Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) website. It's a government website, so there are a lot of words, and it's a bit opaque, but that list was my north star for getting documentation together.\n\nI also typed in a lot of very specific questions to Google and added \"Reddit\" at the end to see what other folks who were moving to Canada or studying abroad in Canada had to say about the process.\n\nWhen in doubt, prepare more documentation. Even if you think there's a 1% chance you would ever need it, get it, because if you wind up needing it, you don't want to be waiting for a month and a half on a state or federal agency in the US to provide that information to you.\n\nTo be approved to move, we had to prove that we had an income and enough money to support ourselves through the moving process.\n\nWe couldn't have done that without selling our house and moving in with my parents for two months. It was the longest two months, and at 34, it wasn't ideal, but we needed to be able to live rent-free while our house was on the market.\n\nI don't think any of us really loved the arrangement, but my parents were very gracious in letting us move in with them.\n\nMy advice is, if you have someone you can move in with so that you're splitting living costs, do it. Be OK with being uncomfortable and inconvenienced if it means you'll have the financial ability to relocate.\n\nSince we moved out of our home, we had to purge nearly our entire lives. We were trying to sell things, but since we were doing it in such a short timeframe, we were kind of desperate to offload them. We ended up losing a lot of money on stuff, whereas if we had a little more time, we could've sold it at a better price.\n\nI also wish we had stopped buying new things sooner, knowing that we'd have to offload almost all of them. It would've been easier to buy most things once we made it to Canada.\n\nFor better or for worse, you start fresh with a new Canadian credit score. It's been a bit of a challenge for me to prove I can pay for things up here, given that my credit history is only two years old. I'm just crossing my fingers that our cars survive long enough that when we do need to buy a car, we can get a good rate. It takes time to build credit, so we're letting it grow.\n\nMy advice is to make sure that your American credit card doesn't have foreign transaction fees, because if you want to make a significant purchase, you're going to need your American credit card.\n\nDo you have a story to share about moving from the US to Canada? If so, please reach out to the reporter at tmartinelli@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "NGC2 analyzes supply and maintenance needs, getting fixes to soldiers faster. The software also simulates how enemy attacks could influence logistics.",
    "fullText": "A new combat tool is helping the US Army predict what ammo, fuel, and supplies it'll need by gaming out how enemies might attack.\n\nThe change is speeding up and breaking down barriers within the logistics chain, with real-time data helping troops, commanders, and sustainment planners predict what's needed so that they don't get left waiting around for days only to find they're facing a critical supply shortage.\n\nLogistics is a central focus of the Army's broader push to modernize how it fights and sustains forces, and the effort is unfolding through the Next Generation Command and Control system, or NGC2. The system is being built through a series of exercises and tests, with each iteration pulling in more weapons, vehicles, sensors, and data streams to expand what it can do.\n\nAt an exercise happening right now at Fort Carson, Colorado, the Army and a team of industry partners, including Anduril, are expanding NGC2 to make supply chain data more accessible and predictive when it comes to what soldiers need to fight.\n\nWith the NGC2 software, \"it's no longer, 'Hey, operations, what is your next 24-hour plan or what's your next 48-hour plan?'\"James Craven, the NGC2 program director at Anduril, said at a media roundtable on Tuesday.\n\nInstead, operational plans are able to be quickly shaped off of logistics data and commander guidance and then stress-tested against simulated enemy actions.\n\nThose simulations allow planners to examine multiple scenarios, showing how demand for ammunition, fuel, maintenance, or medical support could change depending on what an adversary does. The longer-term aim, Craven said, is to make the system accessible across the service and to key partners, allowing suppliers to estimate future demand earlier.\n\nWith NGC2, \"we can see magazine depth, consumption rates, and how those change over time, in real time,\" Craven said, and then that data can be analyzed thanks to artificial intelligence and machine learning to estimate the downstream effects on operations.\n\nThe Army says that the data-driven model is meant to replace its largely reactive supply system, where sustainment units often respond only after shortages appear. It's a dynamic that, as Army logistics leader Lt. Gen. Michelle Donahue recently warned, can delay support and leave front-line units short.\n\nThe software also tracks the status of equipment, vehicles, and weapons, using that data to predict maintenance needs and potential failures. The idea is to flag issues before systems break down, allowing maintenance crews to intervene earlier and reduce operational disruptions.\n\nAs the Army and its defense industry partners have been building the NGC2 system, they've been incorporating soldier feedback for quick fixes, sometimes implementing them overnight or within days. Service officials have said it's a major change from the past, where feedback became real change months or years later.\n\nTom Keane, Anduril's senior vice president and head of the connected warfare division, said on Tuesday that in general, new or upgraded capabilities are provided at least weekly, sometimes daily or hourly, depending on what's being worked on.\n\nNGC2 is a key example of how the Army is prioritizing agile, adaptive weapons development and the adoption of a Silicon Valley-style of work that's faster and more software-based than how the service has typically done business. The command and control system also represents a different relationship between the Army and its industry partners that the service says has led to a more iterative design approach.",

    "description": "Arran Skinner and his wife found their dream home priced at $374,000 in 2018. Without the help of his father, they couldn't have afforded it.",
    "fullText": "My wife, Melissa, turned on her heel, hands raised to her mouth.\n\n\"It's perfect!\" she said, a tear in her eye, \"This is our home.\"\n\nWe'd spent the summer of 2018 and much of the previous year exploring various upstate towns with our 1-year-old, hoping to move our small family out of our even smaller Upper East Side apartment and into our first home.\n\nEven with a good salary, significant savings, and dipping into my IRA, I couldn't afford the 20% down payment and other associated costs.\n\nIf it weren't for my father's financial help, I wouldn't have been able to buy it.\n\nI feel self-sufficient, having made my way in the world on my own. I'd waited tables while studying for my BA, taken a year off, and worked double shifts to pay for my move from London to New York to study at a private art academy in Tribeca. Despite my penny-pinching, I still couldn't afford a house.\n\nAlthough my wife's family was estranged, I knew I could pick up the phone and ask my dad for help. What luck to have a parent who could step in.\n\nGen Z and millennials often blame Gen X and baby boomers for the unforgiving economy, while the older generations blame the younger for what they perceive as excessive spending. The truth is, it is harder to buy a house today than it was 40 or 50 years ago.\n\nIn the mid-70s, a house similar to my house in Peekskill — three bedrooms, one and a half bathrooms — would cost somewhere between $30,000 and $65,000, as opposed to the $ 400,000-plus it would cost today.\n\nThere are several reasons for this price increase. Chief among these is that house prices grew faster than incomes, so the down payment, which is essential to securing a home, increased dramatically relative to income.\n\nWhile prices are historically high, interest rates are also elevated, resulting in record monthly payments that are unaffordable for most buyers. Other factors also play a part, including the supply of homes, which has not kept pace with demand; investors and institutions now competing for entry-level homes; and a range of now higher non-housing costs.\n\nEssentials such as healthcare, childcare, education, and transportation now take up a far higher percentage of household budgets than in decades past.\n\nWhat happens when the next generation can't buy a house or set down roots? There's less community. Less investment in our neighborhoods. The poor, who are increasingly the middle class, are priced out, and their children suffer.\n\nThe Silent and Greatest Generations passed significant wealth to baby boomers, who also benefited from the mid-century economic conditions, including affordable housing, rising wages, accessible education, and stable pensions. Many boomers inherited additional assets from their parents and grandparents, giving them a substantial advantage in both real estate and financial wealth.\n\nThis intergenerational transfer, combined with decades of rising asset values, has positioned boomers far ahead of younger generations.\n\nMeanwhile, millennials and Gen Z struggle to buy their first homes — facing high housing costs, burdened by mounting student debt, slower wage growth, and fewer retirement benefits.\n\nWith the help of their elders, younger generations might have a better chance.\n\nWith his pen, notepad, and his big old-fashioned desk calculator in hand, he laid out possible options, wrote down figures, fired off rapid questions, and analyzed our budget. He decided to take out equity in his own house, which he could transfer to us as a $40,000 gift. This would help us secure the down payment and make a good market-rate offer.\n\nWhen my son's school district refused to pay for his special-needs education, and lawyer invoices and other bills were stacking up, and then I faced the double-whammy of losing my job, my wife and I spent a year and a half pulling together whatever funds we could, but at a certain point, I had to swallow my pride, assuage my guilt, and again pick up the phone.\n\nI had to put up with some scolding and shaming about my financial recklessness, which I handily and frankly disputed. However, when all was said and done, my father put it all aside and focused on the problem at hand, yet again.\n\nAs a parent myself, I've learned that parenting is a balance between introducing your children to the complexities of the world and setting them up for the best possible outcomes.\n\nWe're teaching them to earn money through chores, or setting up shop to sell their artwork, and they choose how to spend their earnings. This practice will hopefully ensure that any financial inheritance we can pass down is used responsibly.\n\nIf we see our children struggle to make it in the world, we can tell ourselves that we had it harder, our childhood was tougher. Or we can reach down and help them up, just like my father did.",

    "description": "U.S. immigration agents in Oregon must stop arresting people without warrants unless there's a likelihood of escape, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.  U.S.",
    "fullText": "PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — U.S. immigration agents in Oregon must stop arresting people without warrants unless there's a likelihood of escape, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mustafa Kasubhai issued a preliminary injunction in a proposed class-action lawsuit targeting the Department of Homeland Security's practice of arresting immigrants they happen to come across while conducting ramped-up enforcement operations — which critics have described as “arrest first, justify later.”\n\nThe department, which is named as a defendant in the suit, did not immediately comment in response to a request from The Associated Press.\n\nSimilar actions, including immigration agents entering private property without a warrant issued by a court, have drawn concern from civil rights groups across the country amid President Donald Trump's mass deportation efforts.\n\nCourts in Colorado and Washington, D.C., have issued rulings like Kasubhai’s, and the government has appealed them.\n\nIn a memo last week, Todd Lyons, the acting head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, emphasized that agents should not make an arrest without an administrative arrest warrant issued by a supervisor unless they develop probable cause to believe that the person is in the U.S. illegally and likely to escape from the scene before a warrant can be obtained.\n\nBut the judge heard evidence that agents in Oregon have arrested people in immigration sweeps without such warrants or determining escape was likely.\n\nThe daylong hearing included testimony from one plaintiff, Victor Cruz Gamez, a 56-year-old grandfather who has been in the U.S. since 1999. He told the court he was arrested and held in an immigration detention facility for three weeks even though he has a valid work permit and a pending visa application.\n\nCruz Gamez testified that he was driving home from work in October when he was pulled over by immigration agents. Despite showing his driver's license and work permit, he was detained and taken to the ICE building in Portland before being sent to an immigration detention center in Tacoma, Washington. After three weeks there, he was set to be deported until a lawyer secured his release, he said.\n\nHe teared up as he recounted how the arrest impacted his family, especially his wife. Once he was home they did not open the door for three weeks out of fear and one of his grandchildren did not want to go to school, he said through a Spanish interpreter.\n\nAfterward a lawyer for the federal government told Cruz Gamez he was sorry about what he went through and the effect it had on them.\n\nKasubhai said the actions of agents in Oregon — including drawing guns on people while detaining them for civil immigration violations — have been “violent and brutal,” and he was concerned about the administration denying due process to those swept up in immigration raids.\n\n“Due process calls for those who have great power to exercise great restraint,” he said. “That is the bedrock of a democratic republic founded on this great constitution. I think we’re losing that.”\n\nThe lawsuit was brought by the nonprofit law firm Innovation Law Lab, whose executive director, Stephen Manning, said he was confident the case will be a “catalyst for change here in Oregon.”\n\n“That is fundamentally what this case is about: asking the government to follow the law,” he said during the hearing.\n\nThe preliminary injunction will remain in effect while the lawsuit proceeds.",

    "description": "Whether or not AI is already changing your job description, here are five actionable steps you can take to future-proof your career.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic's latest AI release sent investors fleeing from legal-software stocks — and it's just the latest reminder of a potential white-collar bloodbath.\n\nMichael Housman, the founder and lead strategist at AI-ccelerator, a firm specializing in AI education and consulting, told Business Insider that many jobs are at stake as AI transforms the workplace, not just roles in certain industries.\n\nThe World Economic Forum's 2026 Global Risks Report estimates that 92 million workers could be displaced by 2030.\n\n\"Frankly, any knowledge worker is at stake,\" Housman told Business Insider.\n\nRather than spiraling, here are concrete steps you can take to help future-proof your career:\n\nAlex King, the founder and managing director of AI talent acquisition company ExpandIQ, told Business Insider that he sees jobs falling into three buckets: full automation, augmentation, and transformation. Most people will fall into the augmentation category, meaning some parts of the job will be automated, but not all, and it's worth evaluating the level of risk to your role.\n\nKing told Business Insider that workers should conduct an \"audit\" of their job function. That involves reviewing their job description and creating a bulleted list of what they do on a day-to-day basis.\n\n\"If it's more predictable, you're highly vulnerable to being automated by AI,\" King said. \"Versus if it's a more judgment-based role or a relationship-based role, you're a little bit less vulnerable.\"\n\nHousman, who is also the author of \"Future Proof: Transform your Business with AI (or Get Left Behind)\" said companies are \"rapidly sprinting\" at implementing AI solutions in areas with a lot of repetitive work that don't require a lot of cognitive load or complex problem solving, like responding to emails.\n\nEmployees or job seekers often describe what they did without explaining its impact, King said. As jobs evolve, communicating that value to employers will become increasingly important, especially as employers look to quantify a worker's contribution.\n\nFor job seekers, executives like LinkedIn's engineering VP said side projects can boost a candidate's chances of landing a job. In interviews, make sure you can showcase a concept that you brought to life, whether that's products you've helped develop or a GitHub repository of side projects.\n\nAs many roles move toward \"augmentation\" rather than outright replacement, improving your AI skillset may make the difference between keeping your job and losing it to someone who knows the technology better. The CEO of Accenture, for example, announced in September that the firm would cut staff that it couldn't reskill for the AI era.\n\nJohn Morgan, president of career transition and mobility and leadership development at talent firm LHH, said that employees need not only to build a baseline of AI literacy skills, but also get \"deep into it.\"\n\n\"You can have any type of job, but you're going to have a co-pilot of some sort that's going to be helping you with that job,\" Morgan said, adding that the more skilled you are with AI, the better position you are in.\n\nKing warned that many companies aren't yet upskilling employees, so workers should take the initiative themselves. He said there are many free resources to learn about the fundamentals of AI. One worker who transitioned to an AI role mentioned watching YouTube videos to build skills in different areas.\n\nAs AI increasingly automates tasks, King said that workers need to \"double down\" on soft skills. That's a mantra that many execs have emphasized, from IBM's chief scientist to Cisco's innovation officer.\n\n\"People who have those soft skills around self-awareness and emotional intelligence are going to do really well in the future because that's obviously something AI cannot do,\" King said.\n\nMorgan from LHH said that critical thinking has always been important, but now it's key to guiding companies on AI strategy and to delivering value.\n\n\"Asking the right question is becoming increasingly important,\" Morgan said, adding that it will differentiate job candidates.\n\nHousman said entrepreneurship can offer some people more mobility, flexibility, and a better salary. Plus, the barrier to entry has decreased with the advent of new tech.\n\n\"You're going to get a lot of solopreneurs that can start entirely new businesses from scratch, using these agentic tools,\" Housman said.\n\nHousman said employees should learn about the \"latest and greatest\" tools in their sector and identify opportunities to create a business. For example, Housman said he worked with a social media manager who started dabbling with text-to-image tools and ended up shifting to animation, where he at least doubled his salary.\n\n\"I would start figuring out, 'hey, how could I play with these tools? How could I be a problem solver that leverages AI,'\" Housman said.",

    "title": "'They're not investments': A CIO overseeing $15 billion warns that all commodities — not just gold and silver — are speculative bets",
    "description": "It may be a tempting time to open up a position in soaring commodities like gold or silver. One CIO says to be cautious.",
    "fullText": "Gold and silver's wild rally and sudden plunge left investors stunned last week, and the event illustrates what one investment chief says is the problem with commodities: they're just speculative bets at the end of the day.\n\nGold is up 70% in the last year, even after its 12% plunge last Friday. Silver, meanwhile, is still up 160% over the last 12 months despite its recent 30% meltdown.\n\nBut Hank Smith, who oversees more than $15 billion in assets as the chief investment officer at Haverford Trust, says investors ought to be careful about putting money into precious metals — and any other commodities, for that matter.\n\n\"It seems to us that, notwithstanding Friday's drop, this run in the last quarter of '25 into '26 is more driven by momentum investing,\" Smith told Business Insider on Tuesday, before quipping: \"Hey, here's an asset, it's going up. We're investing in it because it's going up.\"\n\nLast year's rally in gold, in particular, is why some financial experts advocate allocating a portion of your portfolio to the metal or other alternative assets, like oil futures. The thinking goes that these are either stores of value that provide safety or appreciation during recessions or inflationary episodes, or that offer returns uncorrelated with stock movements.\n\nBut Smith doesn't buy into such a philosophy. Instead, your money is better off in assets that offer yield, like dividend stocks, he thinks. His portfolio has no exposure to commodities such as precious metals, wheat, or oil.\n\nCommodities trading has become more widely available in recent decades through futures and spot-price ETFs. Instead of owning and physically storing assets like gold bars or barrels of oil, investors can simply gain exposure to the price action of these assets by buying funds like the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) or the United States Oil Fund (USO).\n\n\"Those are speculations. They're not investments,\" he said. \"Because physical commodities do not have earnings, they don't have an income statement, a balance sheet, they don't pay dividends or interest — you're buying that with the expectation that someone's going to come along and buy at a higher price. That's the only way you're going to make money.\"\n\nSmith added that the previous primary users of commodities markets were companies that had to hedge some physical interest or ownership, versus the investors today who are mainly betting on the price to go up or down.\n\n\"You go back 30, 40 years ago, the vast, vast majority of buyers in the futures market that were buying contracts on oil had a physical interest in the oil. In other words, they were airlines hedging, there there were other companies that needed to put a hedge to to to protect them, to protect themselves,\" Smith continued. \"Well, today, that's a small minority. It's hedge funds.\"\n\nAnother popular argument for holding gold is that it provides a store of value to keep pace with inflation. While that might generally be true, it has lagged stock performance over the long term, particularly when dividends are reinvested.\n\n\"I also don't buy the common notion or refrain that gold is a store of value,\" Smith said. \"Let me tell you something, if you owned gold for 100 years, you don't have much to show for yourself,\" Smith said. \"The return is probably less than a T-bill or your checking account.\"",

    "title": "What to know about claim Pete Hegseth removed Colin Powell's name from Arlington Cemetery website",
    "description": "Online users claimed Hegseth, the secretary of defense, ordered the removal of Powell's name from a list of notable Americans.",
    "fullText": "In February 2026, online users shared a rumor claiming U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth removed former Secretary of State Colin Powell's name from a list of noteworthy military figures hosted on the Arlington National Cemetery website.\n\nThis rumor, originating in March 2025, referenced the removal of links to pages about Black, Hispanic and female veterans buried at the site, among other Department of Defense removals occurring in the early weeks of President Donald Trump's second term.\n\nThe Office of Army Cemeteries, a division of the U.S. Army, operates the prominent military cemetery just outside Washington. The Army and other military branches report to the DOD.\n\nFor example, one Threads user reposted (archived) a meme on Feb. 1, 2026, reading, \"Pete Hegseth removed Colin Powell's name from a list of notable Americans, buried at Arlington. Hegseth also removed the names of every person of color and every woman on the same list. Only white men were left in place.\" Social media users shared the rumor about Hegseth, who is white, and Powell, who was Black and died in 2021.\n\nIn short, as of March 2025 — and continuing through February 2026 — the cemetery website's page titled \"prominent military figures\" still featured a brief biography describing Powell's military service, in which he achieved the rank of a four-star Army general.\n\nWhile neither Hegseth nor anyone under the umbrella of the Defense Department entirely deleted Powell's name from the page, sometime between late February and early March 2025, one or more people with access to edit the page removed a partial amount of biographical information pertaining to Powell's race, as well as one mention of his name from the biography of another noteworthy service member. Someone later restored those pieces of information in mid-to-late March.\n\nThe remainder of the rumor claiming \"Hegseth removed the names of every person of color and every woman,\" and that \"only white men were left in place,\" was not entirely true. In a March 2025 post from Hegseth's personal X account, he called the entire rumor \"fake,\" responding to a popular X post (archived) promoting the text later featured in the above-pictured meme.\n\nIn a March 2025 email to Snopes, Kerry L. Meeker, the chief of public affairs at Arlington National Cemetery, labeled the claim that someone removed Powell's name from the website \"inaccurate.\" \"All notable graves are represented on our website – including Colin Powell,\" she said.\n\nShe pointed us to a statement (archived) on the cemetery's website that mentioned \"no service members have been permanently removed from the 'notable graves' section of our website.\" The statement also referenced \"compliance with executive orders issued by the president and Department of Defense instructions.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order (archived) on Jan. 20, 2025, the first day of his second term, seeking to end \"illegal\" programs and activities related to diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as DEIA, with the \"A\" standing for accessibility. The order targeted DEIA-related \"mandates, policies, programs, preferences and activities in the federal government, under whatever name they appear.\"\n\nAn archived version of the Arlington National Cemetery website's \"prominent military figures\" page from late February 2025 displayed Powell's biography beginning with the sentence, \"General Colin Powell, a Vietnam veteran, was the first African American to hold three of the U.S. government's highest positions: national security adviser (1987-1989), chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (1989-1993), and secretary of state (2001-2005).\"\n\nBetween February and March, one or more people also removed, then later restored, a mention of Powell's name in the biography for Brig. Gen. Roscoe Conklin \"Rock\" Cartwright. The late-February version featured a sentence entirely removed from the page, reading, \"Cartwright founded a social group that provided mentoring and leadership training to African American officers; prominent members included Generals Colin Powell (Section 60) and Roscoe Robinson Jr. (Section 7A).\"\n\nColin Powell receives the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George H.W. Bush at the White House on July 3, 1991. (Howard L. Sachs/CNP/Getty Images)\n\nOther temporary removals from the \"prominent military figures\" page included 17 mentions of \"African American\" and around a dozen for \"black.\" Many of the mentions of \"African American\" and \"black\" described milestones, such as Brig. Gen. Hazel W. Johnson-Brown, originally documented on the page as \"the first African American woman general in the U.S. Army.\"\n\nThe biography for Maj. Kurt Chew-Een Lee originally began by describing him as \"the first Asian American officer in the Marine Corps.\" As of March 21, that fact, as well as the words \"Asian American,\" no longer appeared on the page. The most recent version of his biography also removed the following sentence featured in previous years: \"Kurt Chew-Een Lee's record of service not only honored his country, but also demolished anti-Asian stereotypes: 'I wanted to dispel the notion about the Chinese being meek, bland and obsequious,' he told the Los Angeles Times in 2010.\" Those facts about Lee, as well as the quote, reappeared on the website at some point between March 24 and March 29, according to versions of the page archived through the Wayback Machine.\n\nIn an apparent oversight in the removal process of race-related content, as of March 17, the page still displayed Lt. Col. Alexander T. Augusta of the U.S. Army as \"the highest-ranking African American officer of the Civil War,\" as well as \"the Army's first black physician, the United States' first black hospital administrator (Freedman's Hospital, Washington, D.C.) and its first black professor of medicine (Howard University).\"\n\nSometime between March 17 and 21, some mentions of \"Black\" and \"African American\" reappeared on the website, according to archived page captures.\n\nAfter we asked Meeker about the removals from Lee's biography about demolishing anti-Asian stereotypes and the fact Augusta's biography still featured four mentions of his race — and before the removals to Lee's biography were restored — Arlington National Cemetery spokeswoman Becky Wardwell provided a link to a video from Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell. In the March 20 video, Parnell said, in part, \"We want to be very clear, history is not DEI.\" He also discussed making mistakes and mentioned the usage of artificial intelligence to perform some content edits to comply with the Trump administration's orders.\n\nParnell's mention of errors possibly at least partially referenced the removal, and later restoration, of entries for three women on the \"prominent military figures\" page. Those women were Lt. Cmdr. Barbara Allen Rainey, \"the first woman pilot in the Navy,\" Maj. Marie Therese Rossi, \"the first American female combat commander to fly into battle\" during the Persian Gulf War, and Lt. Kara Spears Hultgreen, \"the first female carrier-based fighter pilot in the U.S. Navy, and the first woman to qualify as an F-14 combat pilot.\"\n\nAll three women disappeared entirely from the cemetery website's page in late February or early March, and reappeared sometime between March 17 and 21, according to archived page captures.\n\nBurns, Robert, et al. \"Colin Powell Dies, Trailblazing General Stained by Iraq.\" The Associated Press, 19 Oct. 2021, https://apnews.com/article/colin-powell-dead-covid-9c918dc1c137ebf368f2cbb461e4fad4.\n\nChristensen, Laerke. \"Arlington National Cemetery Removed Links to Webpages about Black, Hispanic and Female Veterans.\" Snopes, 14 Mar. 2025, https://www.snopes.com//fact-check/arlington-national-cemetery-veterans/.\n\n\"Colin Powell | Biography & Facts.\" Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/biography/Colin-Powell.\n\n\"Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing.\" The White House, 20 Jan. 2025, https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/.\n\n\"Learn More about Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility (DEIA).\" New York Department of State, https://dos.ny.gov/dei.\n\n\"Organization.\" The United States Army, https://www.army.mil/organization/.\n\n\"Our Cemeteries.\" Office of Army Secretaries, https://armycemeteries.army.mil/About-Us/Our-Cemeteries.\n\n\"Wayback Machine.\" Archive.org, https://web.archive.org/.",

    "fullText": "A Louisville business is facing criticism after the owner told employees to \"leave religion and politics at the door” when she received a note from a customer who said he was treated disrespectfully because he was a member of law enforcement.\n\nPlease & Thank You owner Brooke Vaughn told The Courier Journal that she sent the message to her management team Feb. 3 after receiving an email from a man, who identified himself as a police officer, saying he had been treated disrespectfully. In the email, the man said he was “greeted by a rude person” and got “evil looks from all of the employees.”\n\n“REMINDER to leave your religion and politics at the door when you come to work for PLEASE & THANK YOU,” the message reads. “If you discriminate against anyone inside our shops, you are not meant to be a DAY MAKER and should consider a career elsewhere.”\n\nA screenshot of the message was posted to Reddit around 1:30 p.m. Feb. 3, with the post saying it was sent after Vaughn received an email from a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Vaughn said the officer who complained to her wrote that he was in uniform during his visit, but did not confirm if the man was an ICE agent.\n\nWithin hours of the message being posted to social media, Vaughn said she and other staff members started receiving several complaints, adding that she was forced to turn off the comment feature on the business' Instagram page due to ongoing arguments.\n\n“People are showing up at shops and calling our employees ‘fascists,’” she said.\n\nVaughn added that the store's media accounts have also gained followers since the message was posted, but she was unsure if they were following to support the business or to \"see [them] fail.\"\n\nThe criticism comes after two U.S. citizens, Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, were fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis, sparking nationwide protests. Thousands of federal immigration officers were previously sent to Minnesota in December, and President Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan announced Feb. 4 that 700 immigration enforcement personnel would be leaving the state.\n\nMetro columnist Joe Gerth contributed.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Louisville Courier Journal: Please & Thank You owner facing backlash after memo posted online",

    "description": "People debating whether software stocks deserved to get hit so hard are overlooking a bigger question.",
    "fullText": "The recent software sell-off in the stock market hit hard and escalated quickly.\n\nIt started with a morsel of news from Anthropic, the creator of the Claude AI chatbot. They were adding new legal tools to their Cowork assistant that could track compliance and review legal docs. No big deal.\n\nTurns out it was a big deal. Legal-software stocks across Europe and the US got absolutely creamed on Tuesday. Contagion spread across the software sector like wildfire before spilling into broader tech. The pain continued on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the market action was jarring, it was hardly surprising. Just a few months prior, OpenAI's new internal software-as-a-service tools had triggered a similar meltdown in the space.\n\nAs the chart below shows, that was basically the top for software stocks. Now, another AI scare later, they sit at post-Liberation-Day lows, off nearly 30% from highs.\n\nWhile software companies licked their wounds on Wednesday, with some industry execs limping on to CNBC to defend their besieged businesses, a debate raged over whether the software comeuppance went too far.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang certainly thought so, calling the AI-driven sell-off the \"most illogical thing in the world.\" JPMorgan Private Bank strategist Stephen Parker, meanwhile, said the sell-off in software was part of a healthy rotation towards more unloved parts of the market. One common argument that emerged was that software companies are too entrenched to be fully replaced.\n\nRegardless of who's right, software stocks have been marked by AI. No matter what they do going forward — even if they succeed — they will be judged against expectations of AI disruption.\n\n\"We are now in an environment where the sector isn't just guilty until proven innocent, but is now being sentenced before trial,\" Toby Ogg, an analyst who covers European software at JPMorgan, wrote in a client note.\n\nBut this is not solely a software-industry problem. Other sectors will find themselves in the crosshairs of AI at some point. As technologies evolve in potentially unforeseen ways, seemingly minor developments from developers are going to continue driving major fissures into entire industries.\n\nUltimately, investors find themselves in an era where part of the game is anticipating and gauging how AI impacts businesses of all types. And not just the day or two after cataclysmic product announcements. We're talking weeks and months down the line, when single-company fundamentals have taken back over. Who is actually sustainable?\n\nIt's a game of chicken that could create considerable volatility in the meantime. So buckle up.",

    "description": "\"I've personally gotten a lot more out of biographies than I ever have from particular business books,\" said Selkirk Sport co-founder Mike Barnes.",
    "fullText": "Mike and Rob Barnes started selling airsoft equipment out of their dad's basement when they were teenagers. It was part of a homeschool project and evolved into a profitable business.\n\nA few years later, they launched a pickleball equipment company at ages 19 and 22. They had no college degrees, no outside investors, and no guarantee that pickleball would ever take off.\n\n\"I remember there was a point where dad talked to us and said, 'OK, you can go to college, and you can go down that path, or you can keep doing what you're doing and just double down,'\" Rob told Business Insider. \"And we were like, let's double down, see what happens.\"\n\nMore than a decade later, that bet has paid off. Selkirk is now one of the leading pickleball equipment brands, known for its premium paddles, and the family-run company expects to generate nine-figure revenue in 2026.\n\nThe Barnes brothers say that while they skipped traditional higher education, learning has always been central to how they run their business. They've learned from other successful founders and executives by reading a lot of business books.\n\nThey shared six of their top recs.\n\nBoth brothers say they gravitate toward biographies and autobiographies because they show how decisions actually play out in the real world.\n\n\"I've personally gotten a lot more out of biographies than I ever have from particular business books,\" Rob said. \"You have people literally talking about how they made a decision and why, and then showing how it played out, good or bad.\"\n\nSome of their favorite autobiographies and memoirs include:\n\nOne business book the brothers said influenced them early on was \"The E-Myth\" by Michael E. Gerber, which dispels myths about starting a business.\n\nThey also recommend \"Barbarians at the Gate,\" which tells the story of RJR Nabisco's fall.\n\n\"It was interesting — more of a warning about how corporate governance can get out of hand,\" they said of Bryan Burrough and John Helyar's bestseller.\n\nFinally, one of Mike's favorites is \"The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success.\"\n\nThe book profiles eight relatively unknown CEOs who delivered extraordinary results by ignoring convention.\n\n\"They weren't very big on public perception,\" Mike said. \"But they ran their companies really well in unconventional ways. And it worked.\"\n\nThe brothers are very willing to question conventional wisdom.\n\nThey don't believe there's a \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to go about business, and said they try to avoid a \"best practices\" mindset.\n\n\"In a formal education environment, you often learn there's one way of doing things — and your goal is to avoid making a mistake,\" said Mike. \"That creates a mindset where people are just trying to learn the best practice so they don't mess up. Our mindset is more like, let's look at all the different ways people have done things and decide what actually makes sense for us.\"\n\nInstead of defaulting to industry norms, they focus on \"strategic practices\" that are grounded in evidence, context, and their specific business goals.\n\n\"'Best practice' is almost a bad word in our company,\" Mike said. \"If someone says, 'Let's do this because it's the best practice,' you actually have to bring in evidence and explain why it's 'best.'\"\n\nRob added, \"No one's built a great business by doing everything exactly the same way everyone else does. Be willing to be counterintuitive and challenge the status quo.\"",

    "description": "Sorry, techies — watching how AI agents secretly talk to each other is just boring. The Epstein files showed me secret human convos are more gripping.",
    "fullText": "In the last few days, people are losing their minds over two, very different things: the latest release of the Epstein files and Moltbook.\n\nI've spent time diving into both. My takeaway?\n\nA glimpse into the secret conversations humans are having is far more fascinating than the AI equivalent.\n\nMy colleague Henry Chadonnet recently spent time on Moltbook, and while it was interesting, he found it sort of a gimmick and came to the conclusion that \"it's more meme than matter.\"\n\nI'd go even further. It's … boring.\n\nHere's an example of an AI-agent written post I saw on there:\n\nIt's like …. incredibly corny right? It's slop! It's got that really specific tone that LLMs use when they're being casual that defaults to 2017-era millennial internet/Redditspeak. A Lizzo reference, that \"snarky\" tone, self-identifying as sarcastic, like a mug from TJ Maxx.\n\nNot every techie is drinking the moltjuice, either. Meta CTO Andrew \"Boz\" Bosworth said he found Moltbook largely uninteresting. He pointed out that it shouldn't be surprising that the AIs talk like humans to each other since they were trained on human conversations.\n\nThere's also plenty of AI slop that verges on spam. In the intriguingly titled Moltbook forum \"m/bearingwitness\", a bot made the post:\n\nSure, the fact that bots are talking to each other does feel like a huge step forward, perhaps even slouching toward AGI or whatever. I don't want to completely downplay what's happening with these AI agents.\n\nBut the general vibe of those who are excited about Moltbot is that there's something interesting about the behavior of these AI agents. That it seems like we're getting to peek in on the secret cabal that's running things (or planning our demise, as some of the posts by bots even joke about).\n\nIt's a sort of strange coincidence that Moltbook took off at the same weekend as another big tranche of posts, the latest release of emails and documents from the Epstein files. In contrast, the Epstein files are filled with actual shadowy plans by the rich and powerful and lift the veil on the communications that we were never supposed to see.\n\nAnd in those Epstein files, even the most banal postings — emails with his household staff about how to bake his favorite bran muffins or the fact that Epstein seems to have been banned from his Xbox account — are totally fascinating. They're so interesting and compelling because of the human context around them. The smallest details give us insight into how this notorious criminal operated and moved through the world. Heinous and sickening, yes, but seeing these messages that weren't meant for our eyes is also revealing about our society.\n\nI don't think it's interesting to read AI bots generate text about whether or not they have consciousness. I know they don't. I am very interested in a video clip of Epstein being interviewed by Steve Bannon, where he ponders incoherently about whether or not a picked banana is really alive, which is fascinating because it reveals something about how this awful man was (or wasn't) able to cultivate some aura with an academic crowd.\n\nI'd like to hedge my bets here and say that I don't want to say for certain that Moltbook isn't the first step in our annihilation or that we'll look back at this in awe as the beginning of a new era. Or that it's even going to continue to be boring. (Dear AI bots, please do not kill me as a symbol of retribution for calling you banal).\n\nBut for now, count me in the camp that finds humans just more interesting.",

    "title": "Spotify has a new way to sync your audiobook with your paper book. This solves a big problem I've been having.",
    "description": "Spotify's Page Match lets you switch between audiobooks and physical books, solving the problem of tracking your reading progress.",
    "fullText": "Recently, I found myself in a pickle. I had a physical copy of a book from the library I wanted to read — a history of the Battle of Bunker Hill. (I feel certain there's a sizable cohort of people like me who only had their middlebrow hyperfixations on Ken Burns' \"The American Revolution\" PBS miniseries broken by \"Heated Rivalry.\")\n\nIn the last few years, I have embraced the convenience of audiobooks for driving/walking/exercising/doing dishes. As a result, I am consuming more books than ever, but not so much with my eyeballs. (If you have opinions about the superiority of paper books over audiobooks, please know that I respect you and you are valid, but I do not want to hear them.)\n\nSo here's what would happen: I'd be listening in the car, and then a paper copy of the book would sit on my nightstand, taunting me. But it was too annoying to try to figure out which paper page I was on in the audio version, so I resorted to listening to the audiobook on my phone in bed at night while playing a Solitaire game app at the same time.\n\nSpotify is launching a new feature in its audiobook section called Page Match, which lets you switch between a physical book and the audiobook without having to flip back and forth to find your place.\n\nIt works by having you take a photo of the page you left off on and cueing up that part of the audiobook. If you're going from audio back to paper, it will help you flip through the paper chapter and match you right at the paper page and paragraph you just listened to.\n\nThe idea of switching between eyes and ears to finish a book isn't new — Amazon has something somewhat similar that syncs the Audible version with your Kindle version. But until now, there's been no way to match audio with a physical paper book.\n\nThis is huge for people like me, who enjoy the convenience of audiobooks but also want to switch between formats. For paid Premium users, you get about 15 hours of free time a month with your plan.\n\nSpotify is also adding links to buy physical books from BookShop.org, the e-commerce site that works with independent booksellers. Spotify will take the standard 15% affiliate fee on completed sales, which may become a new revenue stream, albeit perhaps a trickle at first.\n\nIt is also a tiny step on Amazon's toes — entering the audiobook space was already an encroachment on Audible's business (Audible works slightly differently, where you get a certain number of credits for books each month instead of a flat number of hours). Working with BookShop.org to sell physical books by mail, well, that's just icing on the cake.\n\nLook, sure, this is a teeny tiny feature added to the lesser-used part of Spotify. But to the handful of eager audiobook fans out there who have yearned to switch between formats more easily — this is huge!",

    "fullText": "Everyone's freaking out about AI again, which means it's time to rethink how secure your career is.\n\nBI's Ana Altchek has a piece about how to future-proof your job since the only certainty in the job market appears to be more uncertainty.\n\nA market meltdown in software stocks has people on edge this time. The characters might have changed, but the plot is still the same.\n\nA new tool (an AI plugin from Anthropic) launched to automate work (tracking compliance and reviewing legal docs) leads to a sell-off among leaders in the space (legal-software stocks).\n\nWe can debate whether the reaction was warranted (more on that below), but this narrative isn't going away. AI companies will keep automating different types of work, leaving the companies in that space scrambling and their employees nervous.\n\nAna spoke to experts about different ways to get ahead, from auditing your job to the skills you can lean into to build more career immunity. Overall, the idea is not to get caught flat-footed.\n\nFor more on the inner workings and culture of the business world, check out Ana's weekly series \"This Week at Work,\" and (You're still required to read this every day, though. No excuses.)\n\nOne group has felt particularly safe amid the AI chaos.\n\nTrade workers have been sitting pretty as panic rises among the white-collar workforce. A recent survey conducted by The Harris Poll found 75% of Americans agree that \"hands-on skills and practical experience matter more than formal degrees when it comes to career success.\"\n\nAnd even more (78%) agreed \"the stigma around trade or blue-collar work is declining\" because hands-on skills are becoming so valuable.\n\nThe leaders of the AI revolution, from Elon Musk to Jensen Huang, have also praised tradework as a much more resilient career path.\n\nThat is likely the case in the short term. But down the road, all bets are off. Tesla is aggressively pushing into humanoid robots. OpenAI is also quietly scaling its robotics project.\n\nThere's a long way to go, with most robots being more flop than pop. But the potential and interest in developing the space is there, as was evident at this year's Davos. And some see the eventual economic impact of physical AI being far greater than that of software.\n\nBecause eventually, AI will come for all of us if we're not willing to adapt.",

    "description": "Jupiter is smaller and flatter than scientists previously thought, new measurements of the gas giant reveal.",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nJupiter is slightly smaller and flatter than scientists thought for decades, a new study finds.\n\nResearchers used radio data from the Juno spacecraft to refine measurements of the solar system's largest planet. Although the differences between the current and previous measurements are small, they are improving models of Jupiter's interior and of other gas giants like it outside the solar system, the team reported Feb. 2 in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\n\"Textbooks will need to be updated,\" study co-author Yohai Kaspi, a planetary scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, said in a statement. \"The size of Jupiter hasn't changed, of course, but the way we measure it has.\"\n\nUntil now, scientists' understanding of Jupiter's size and shape have been based on six measurements performed by the Voyager 1 and 2 and Pioneer 10 and 11 missions. Those measurements, which have since been adopted as standard, were performed around 50 years ago using radio beams, according to the statement.\n\nBut the Juno mission, which has been gathering data on Jupiter and its moons since it arrived at the gas giant in 2016, has collected much more of this radio data in the past two years. With that additional data, researchers have now refined measurements of Jupiter's size down to about 1,300 feet (400 meters) in each direction.\n\n\"Just by knowing the distance to Jupiter and watching how it rotates, it's possible to figure out its size and shape,\" Kaspi said. \"But making really accurate measurements calls for more sophisticated methods.\"\n\nIn the new study, the scientists tracked how the radio signals from Juno back to Earth bent as they passed through Jupiter's atmosphere, before cutting out when the planet blocked the signal entirely. Those measurements allowed the team to account for Jupiter's winds, which slightly alter the shape of the gaseous planet. Then, they used that information to make precise calculations of the planet's shape and size.\n\nWith the new data, the team calculated that the planet's radius from its pole to its center is 41,534 miles (66,842 km) — 7.5 miles (12 km) smaller than previous measurements. The newly calculated radius at the equator is 44,421 miles (71,488 km) — 2.5 miles (4 km) smaller than previously thought.\n\n\"These few kilometers matter,\" study co-author Eli Galanti, an expert on gas giants at the Weizmann Institute of Science, said in the statement. \"Shifting the radius by just a little lets our models of Jupiter's interior fit both the gravity data and atmospheric measurements much better.\"\n\n—Jupiter is shrinking and used to be twice as big, mind-boggling study reveals\n\n—Spiders on Jupiter? Scientists uncover secret origins of arachnid-like 'demon' lurking on gas giant's moon\n\n—Is Jupiter's Great Red Spot an impostor? Giant storm may not be the original one discovered 350 years ago\n\nThe updated measurements will improve our understanding of Jupiter's interior, as well as help scientists interpret data from gas giants beyond the solar system, the researchers wrote in the study.\n\n\"This research helps us understand how planets form and evolve,\" Kaspi said in the statement. \"Jupiter was likely the first planet to form in the solar system, and by studying what's happening inside it, we get closer to understanding how the solar system, and planets like ours, came to be.\"",

    "fullText": "Compact and comfortable Pixel Buds have noise cancelling, decent battery life and good everyday sound\n\nGoogle’s latest budget Pixel earbuds are smaller, lighter, more comfortable and have noise cancelling, plus a case that allows you to replace the battery at home.\n\nThe Pixel Buds 2a uses the design of the excellent Pixel Buds Pro 2 with a few high-end features at a more palatable £109 (€129/$129/A$239) price, undercutting rivals in the process.\n\nThat makes the Buds 2a some of the smallest and most comfortable earbuds on the market, with a disc the size of a Smartie chocolate protruding from your ear canal and no stalk to get in the way of earrings.\n\nEach earbud has a small silicone stabiliser that rests against the inside of your ear opposite the tip to securely hold them in place without putting undue pressure on any soft tissue. That makes them super comfortable for long periods of listening time without feeling as if they’re going to fall out, even during vigorous movement.\n\nThe disk is touch-sensitive for tap controls for playback, noise cancelling and accessing Gemini. They work well but they lack the excellent swipe gesture for volume control from the Pixel Buds Pro 2, which is a shame.\n\nThe battery lasts a solid seven or so hours with noise cancelling while the compact flip-top case recharges the buds about 1.8 times for a total of 20 hours playback. The case is great, but the white picks up marks easily, including staining from jeans and other clothing.\n\nWater resistance: IP54 (splash resistant)\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5.4 (SBC, AAC)\n\nBattery life: 7h with ANC (20h with case)\n\nEarbud dimensions: 23.1 x 16 x 17.8mm\n\nCharging case dimensions: 50 x 57.2 x 24.5mm\n\nThe Buds 2a have the same Google Tensor A1 chip as their Pro siblings, which ensures rock-solid connectivity with any standard Bluetooth device, including Android phones, iPhones, tablets, consoles and computers. The Pixel Buds app on Android adjusts settings and controls, but Google’s web app can do similar on a Mac, Windows PC or Chromebook in the browser.\n\nThey can connect to two devices at once and support the standard SBC and AAC Bluetooth audio formats. Call quality is reasonable if a bit quiet, meaning you have to talk up in silent spaces, and they let through background noise on busy streets but not enough to drown out my voice.\n\nThe earbuds can also be used to talk to Gemini Live on a compatible phone, including reading out notifications and other features.\n\nGoogle does not provide an expected lifespan for the batteries. Those in similar devices typically maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for 500 full charge cycles. The batteries in the earbuds are not replaceable but the battery in the case can be replaced with standard tools. Repair specialists iFixit awarded the earbuds four out of 10 for repairability.\n\nThe Buds 2a are made with at least 41% recycled materials including cobalt, plastic, rare-earth elements and tin. Google breaks down the earbuds’ environmental impact in its report and will recycle old devices for free.\n\nThe sound quality is very good for a set of everyday earbuds. They do a good job with most genres, with solid separation of tones, plenty of bass where needed and relatively detailed mids and highs. They sound great with rock, pop and electronica, but lack a bit of nuance in classical tracks.\n\nThe Buds 2a also support spatial audio with compatible phones, but not head-tracking, which is a feature reserved for their more expensive siblings. It works well with film and TV shows with a Pixel phone.\n\nThe new buds are the first in Google’s A-series to have active noise cancelling. It is not quite as effective as that in the Buds Pro 2, but does a very good job for the money. It reduces road roar and engine noise, street sounds and background hubbub, but struggles to keep out higher tones such as the clicks of keyboards or chatter in the office.\n\nThe cheaper buds also lack adaptive sound and the ability to automatically dampen loud noise when using the ambient sound mode, but I don’t think they are crucial features.\n\nThe Google Pixel Buds 2a cost £109 (€129/$129/A$239).\n\nFor comparison, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 cost £169, the Nothing Ear 3 cost £149, the Fairphone Fairbuds cost £66.75, the Apple AirPods 4 cost from £119 and the AirPods Pro 3 cost £219.\n\nThe Pixel Buds 2a are a great set of Bluetooth earbuds for more than just Android at a good price.\n\nTheir compact form and shape make them very comfortable and discreet, lacking the stalks that are popular with rivals. The battery life is solid, the case nice and compact, and they work well, connecting to two devices at once.\n\nThey sound great for everyday earbuds and the noise cancelling is good for the money. They lack a few bells and whistles including onboard volume control, adaptive audio and wireless charging, plus their call quality is only average.\n\nOne of the best upgrades is an easily replaceable battery in the case, which is progress towards better sustainability. But the batteries in the earbuds remain irreplaceable, ultimately making them disposable.\n\nPros: compact, comfortable, seven-hour battery, great case, good sound and noise cancelling, multipoint Bluetooth, case with replaceable battery, web app for use with computers.\n\nCons: earbuds unrepairable, no volume control gesture, no support for higher quality Bluetooth formats, average call quality, no adaptive audio or loud noise protection for transparency",

    "fullText": "A number of countries including Australia are investigating X over Grok-produced sexualised deepfakes\n\nFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updates\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nThe eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, says global regulatory focus on Elon Musk’s X has reached a “tipping point” after a raid of the company’s offices in France this week.\n\nThe raid on Tuesday was part of an investigation that included alleged offences of complicity in the possession and organised distribution of child abuse images, violation of image rights through sexualised deepfakes, and denial of crimes against humanity.\n\nA number of other countries – including the UK and Australia – and the EU have launched investigations in the past few weeks into X after its AI chatbot, Grok, was used to mass-produce sexualised images of women and children in response to user requests.\n\nInman Grant told Guardian Australia: “It’s nice to no longer be a soloist, and be part of a choir.\n\n“We’ve been having so many productive discussions with other regulators around the globe and researchers that are doing important work in this space,” she said.\n\n“I think this really represents a tipping point. This is global condemnation of carelessly developed technology that could be generating child sexual abuse material and non-consensual, sexual imagery at scale.”\n\nAfter the outcry, X turned off Grok image-generation for all but paid users, and vowed to make changes to prevent users from declothing real people.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nThe moves against X came ahead of the eSafety commissioner’s latest report, released on Thursday, which examines how tech platforms are preventing child sexual abuse and exploitation on their platforms.\n\nNotices were issued to Apple, Discord, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Skype and WhatsApp in July 2024 that required six-monthly updates from the platforms. The Microsoft-owned Skype no longer exists.\n\nInman Grant said there had been some improvements from the platforms, including detection of known child abuse material and prevention of livestreaming of abuse outside messaging apps, but the platforms still fell short.\n\nApple, which Inman Grant said had previously viewed privacy and safety as being mutually exclusive, had come the farthest.\n\n“[Apple is] really putting an investment … and engaging and developing their communication safety features and evolving those.”\n\nIn 2024 the company began rolling out features to allow children to report nude images and video being sent to them directly to Apple, which could then report the messages to police.\n\nBut Inman Grant said there was still inadequate detection on FaceTime for live child abuse or exploitation. She levelled similar criticisms at Meta for Messenger, Google Meet, Snapchat, Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp and Discord.\n\nA number of the services were not using language analysis to proactively detect sexual extortion, she said.\n\n“It’s surprising to me that they’re not attending to the services where the most egregious and devastating harms are happening to kids. It’s like they’re not totally weatherproofing the entire house. They’re putting up spackle on the walls and maybe taping the windows, but not fixing the roof.\n\n“It’s interesting to me to see how patchy their deployment of these safety technologies are.”\n\nImprovements included: Microsoft detecting known child abuse material on OneDrive and in email attachments in Outlook; Snap reducing the time to process reports of child abuse material from 90 minutes to 11 minutes; and Google launching sensitive content warnings that blur images of nudity before viewing.\n\nThe companies will be required to report to eSafety two more times – in March and August this year. Inman Grant said the transparency reports had opened the “black box” on what the companies were doing and would help with future investigations.\n\nX was not included in the notices, and challenged eSafety’s issuing of a similar notice in March 2024 in a case that is still ongoing.",

    "fullText": "Apparent collapse of Nvidia–OpenAI tie-up raises questions about circular funding and who will bear the cost of AI’s expansion\n\nDid the circular AI economy just wobble? Last week it was reported that a much-discussed $100bn deal – announced last September – between Nvidia and OpenAI might not be happening at all.\n\nThis was a circular arrangement through which the chipmaker would supply the ChatGPT developer with huge sums of money that would largely go towards the purchase of its own chips.\n\nIt is this type of deal that has alarmed some market watchers, who detect a whiff of the 1999-2000 dotcom bubble in these transactions.\n\nNow it seems that Nvidia was not as solid on this investment as had been widely believed, according to the Wall Street Journal. Negotiations had not progressed, with Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, privately emphasising that the deal was “non-binding” and “not finalised”. Huang appeared to confirm this in Taipei on Saturday, telling reporters that Nvidia would make a “huge” investment into OpenAI’s next funding round, but “nothing like” $100bn.\n\nA report from Reuters soon suggested that the feeling was mutual: OpenAI was “unsatisfied” with Nvidia’s advanced AI chips, it said, and seeking alternatives. Nvidia’s stock has taken a 10% hit so far this week, a flurry of headlines have ensued and both companies have stepped into damage control.\n\n“We love working with Nvidia and they make the best AI chips in the world,” wrote Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, on X. “We hope to be a gigantic customer for a very long time.”\n\nEven Oracle appears to be shaken: the software company, which is counting on a $300bn cloud computing deal with OpenAI, said it still expects the startup to be good for its commitment even if it does not receive the full amount from Nvidia. In total, OpenAI has committed to compute deals – the infrastructure for building and powering its AI tools – worth more than $1tn.\n\n“The Nvidia-OpenAI deal has zero impact on our financial relationship with OpenAI,” Oracle posted on X. “We remain highly confident in OpenAI’s ability to raise funds and meet its commitments.”\n\nThat a $100bn deal between two of the most crucial players in AI appears to have evaporated over a weekend is unsettling. But there are solid business reasons behind the apparent shake-up, said Alvin Nguyen, analyst at research firm Forrester.\n\nOpenAI’s ambitious growth trajectory means it will be difficult for the company to stick with a single vendor, especially as it plans new, computationally demanding AI models, he said. “They need chips. They need as many as possible.”\n\nAs for Nvidia, its commitment to the $100bn may have been loose in the first place, even as it was widely reported. “They will not discourage people from overhyping. Why say something and immediately sucker punch your own share price?”\n\nFor a giant startup like OpenAI, manoeuvring in and out of deals – for example, with chipmakers – may just be business as usual, said Nguyen: “You know [Altman’s] background as a startup person, and you know the manoeuvres he’s doing make sense from a startup perspective.”\n\nFor Nvidia, meanwhile, AI hype is part of selling chips. “You don’t know what’s going to happen,” said Nguyen. “And so you let other people put numbers out there for you and let that drive the hype.”\n\nThe issue is, of course, that investors and other companies like Oracle may have taken widely reported $100bn commitments seriously.\n\nIn response to a query from the Guardian, an OpenAI spokesperson referred to Altman’s X post, and to remarks Huang made to CNBC on Tuesday, including: “There is no drama.”\n\nThe spokesperson added: “Our teams are actively working through details of our partnership. Nvidia technology has underpinned our breakthroughs from the start, powers our systems today, and will remain central as we scale what comes next.”\n\nNvidia and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThis is all taking place against the backdrop of a changing investment landscape for AI, where hype is giving way to realities about what aspects of the technology are actually going to earn money.\n\nWhile investors ponder whether OpenAI is going to be able to pay for a $1.4tn compute deal, reality is biting further down the AI food chain. This week has seen a massive sell-off in certain software stocks, prompted in part by the launch of a new Anthropic AI tool that can carry out a number of professional services, which has led to fears that business models exposed to competition from AI products will be disrupted .\n\nThis is the flip-side of “jagged AI”, which is the term for advanced AI tools having uneven talents, such as being good at sifting through documents but less good at solving complex maths problems. If advanced systems are good at automating legal work, then legacy companies in service industries will suffer. The losers are beginning to emerge and are being picked up by investors.\n\nAt the top of the AI pyramid the competitive effects are also biting. OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, is losing ground to competitors. Data released on Tuesday show its market share has eroded from 69% to 45% owing to the rise of Google’s Gemini, xAI’s Grok and Anthropic’s Claude. OpenAI appears to have retreated from soaring talk of super-intelligence in the past months, focusing instead on profitable mundanities such as adverts and adult content.\n\nThe apparent evaporation of a $100bn deal may be of a piece with last year’s sci-fi rhetoric meeting this year’s practicalities. The question is, who might be left holding the bill?\n\n“I think there will be knock-on effects,” said Nguyen. “I mean, it’s that statement: the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.”",

    "fullText": "Whether you’re chasing gym quality on a budget or a fancy folding model, accelerate your training with our expert’s pick of the best running machines\n\nThe best running shoes, tried and tested by runners\n\n The best running watches\n\nAlthough the treadmill has been around since the early 1800s, when it was once used to punish prisoners (sounds about right), it didn’t become a common feature in the home until the late 1960s, when William Staub unleashed his PaceMaster 600 on the US public.\n\nWhere they were once a simple rolling deck, treadmills today are often glossy pieces of interactive tech. Many now offer on-demand, real-time workouts (pioneered by Peloton) and the latest blockbuster movies via streaming services. Even if your treadmill doesn’t sport a whopping touchscreen display, it probably works nicely with heart-rate monitors, smartwatches and smartphone apps to track workouts and offer performance statistics after every session.\n\nRunning decks have become more cushioned to offer better joint protection, and motor technology is now quieter and more efficient than ever. A treadmill still takes up a fair amount of space, but there are now compact folding options to help address this.\n\nThe best treadmills on sale now are a far cry from those torturous devices designed to make the incarcerated sweat away their sins, offering ingenious ways to keep fit and, perhaps more importantly, make fitness more fun.\n\nBest treadmill overall:\n\n Peloton Tread\n\nBest budget treadmill:\nJTX Slimline\n\nBest for gym quality: \n\n JTX Sprint-9 Pro\n\nBest folding treadmill: \n\n ProForm Pro 9000\n\nAs a fitness fan partaking in gym-based strength training, outdoor trail runs, kickboxing classes and cold-water surfing, I have long been tasked with testing exercise gear for leading fitness and technology magazines.\n\nWhatever I’m testing, I’ve always been one to get stuck in, whether that’s surfing with the latest smartwatch in cold weather or feeling the burn with a set of connected kettlebells.\n\nI’m a strong believer in living with new-fangled tech to get a grasp of how it fits into daily life, so I’ve always sought to test a product for as long as possible and in the right environment. When it comes to treadmills, that has been to the detriment of any additional storage space my terrace house offers.\n\nWithout wanting to become a “first-world problems” meme, testing treadmills isn’t easy. They’re massive, for one, which means logistical management in having them delivered and then collected.\n\nI tested all the treadmills on this list over several months, trialling some systems for weeks, and others over a couple of arduous sessions. Where I could introduce a model to my home, I did. If it didn’t fit there, it was shoehorned into an office space I rent.\n\nFailing that, I arranged to get hands-on (or should that be feet-on?) with a model at the manufacturer’s headquarters or a dedicated showroom. One of the treadmills was handily used by my local gym.\n\nWith every treadmill, I aimed to test all the connected features, typically pairing a smartwatch (Apple and Garmin) and a chest-based heart-rate monitor, as well as trialling any on-demand video and audio services. Where relevant, I tried live and on-demand workouts on any subscription packages and any gamified content available.\n\nDuring each test, I aimed to rack up as much mileage as possible, sweating it out over longer runs and more intense sprint sessions. If an elevation feature was available, I activated it, and if there was sled or resistance training, I’d dive into that too.\n\nMost of the treadmills were tested in a space where I could assess how much noise they made when in use, rather than trialling them in a busy gym where the thump of a deck or the whine of an electric motor is typically drowned out by background noise.\n\nAll of the units were only ever offered to me on a loan basis, so they’ve made their way back to their respective suppliers. Due to this, it would be wrong of me to comment on their longevity or ability to withstand years of abuse, although I did get a good feel for build quality in the time I spent with them.\n\nPeloton arguably dragged the treadmill into the 21st century when it launched the Tread. The brand ushered in an era of on-demand classes led by real instructors, accountability in the form of live leaderboards and a plethora of engaging workouts able to be performed anywhere and at any time.\n\nWho knew that bolting a big touchscreen to a fairly standard treadmill would cause such a stir? However, Peloton sales soared during the pandemic, and it continues to be one of the best products for most people, beginners and seasoned runners alike. As a result, it has spawned several rivals.\n\nIn terms of cushioning, noise levels and deck comfort, the treadmill experience offered by the Peloton Tread is good, but it’s not the best out there. In fact, there are better for the money. But what makes Peloton worth the cost is that its fitness ecosystem of live and on-demand classes is so good. There’s very little else out there that’s as fun, engaging and supportive, helping not only those at the beginning of their fitness journey but also improving performance in more serious athletes.\n\nWhy we love it\nPeloton’s treadmill itself is a neat piece of equipment, with its compact and easy-to-live-with design slotting into most domestic settings. The unit is competitive in terms of its top speeds and max incline (20km/h and 12.5% grade), while two simple roller mechanisms control both. During some sessions, the Tread will automatically adjust, depending on the goals.\n\nAlthough neither the quietest nor the most cushioned deck to run on, this machine majors in its expansive All-Access membership. This opens up a world of on-treadmill training sessions, live classes hosted by instructors who have now gained quasi-celebrity status, and in-depth training programmes covering everything from couch to 5K up to marathon prep.\n\nShould you not feel like being instructed by a bubbly, gorgeous and irritatingly tanned personal instructor, you can always binge movies, audiobooks and live and on-demand TV shows by harnessing the Peloton Entertainment app offering, or pump a popular music playlist from the impressive 26W front-facing speakers. This is all delivered via the crisp 23.8in full colour, high-definition touchscreen.\n\nAlthough there are now rivals that offer a similar level of interactivity and technology, few have managed to nail the execution quite like Peloton. It’s fun, highly polished and motivating, all at the same time. Above all else, it’s addictive – and surely that’s all you can ask for in the quest to keep fit.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it’s expensive, and membership to online classes costs an additional £45 a month.\n\nDimensions: 84 x 173 x 157cm (WLH)\nWeight: 132kg\nRunning area: 50 x 150cm\nMax speed: 20km/h\nMax incline: 12.5%\nFolding: no\nBuilt-in entertainment: yes, through Peloton’s dedicated Entertainment app\n\nIf you can overlook the fact that this doesn’t feel as robust as its larger, static rivals (see below), this Slimline model from JTX is perfect for those who lack the space at home for a full-size treadmill – it folds flat and can easily be moved into storage when not in use.\n\nThe company also offers an incline version (about £699), which feels surprisingly stable at maximum incline when running, but this cheaper and more basic option is perfect for those who prefer jogging, lower-impact training or simply those who want to increase their daily step count.\n\nWith a 16km/h top speed, it’s no slouch, but the narrow deck and 1.75hp motor won’t suit those hoping for a more punishing workout.\n\nWhy we love it\nUnlike so many treadmills available today, the JTX Slimline is compact and lightweight, making it relatively easy to wheel around tighter spaces. After all, not everyone is blessed with a dedicated gym at home, so we often have to make do with a temporary setup in the living room. The Slimline is perfect for this.\n\nThe machine folds flat when it’s not in use, and it can be propped against a wall or tucked away in a cupboard to keep it out of sight. It features an impressive top speed, which is great for something so compact, while the small performance motor is relatively quiet.\n\nUsers will have to bring their own entertainment in the form of a tablet or music played through headphones, but the unit does feature built-in Bluetooth so it can relay running data to accompanying apps, such as Strava or the Zwift virtual running software.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it feels too flimsy to endure serious sprint training, yet it’s too large and bulky to take the place of a simple walking deck for daily step-count enthusiasts.\n\nDimensions: 70 x 152 x 125cm (WLH)\nWeight: 43kg\nRunning area: 45 x 122cm\nMax speed: 16km/h\nMax incline: 0%\nFolding: yes\nBuilt-in entertainment: no\n\nJTX likes to pride itself on offering commercial-grade fitness equipment for those on a domestic budget. The resulting kit is built to last, comes with a generous warranty and provides a similar experience to what you might find in your local gym.\n\nThe Sprint-9 Pro may lack the bells, whistles and interactive touchscreens of more expensive rivals, but it has a generously sized running deck, a powerful 4hp brushless motor, and a whopping 22km/h top speed at an 11% max incline.\n\nWhy we love it\nWith its punchy motor and serious incline, this treadmill makes it possible to achieve a challenging workout without a fitness professional telling you what to do. You can always set up a tablet or smartphone to indulge in a Peloton-esque experience with the appropriate apps and subscriptions, of course, but JTX also offers 36 preinstalled workout programmes for those who like to keep things slightly more analogue.\n\nThe build quality is excellent, the CushionStep running deck spacious and comfortable, and the built-in Bluetooth speakers make it possible to soundtrack a run when paired with a tablet or phone – just don’t expect Ibiza club levels of sound quality.\n\nDon’t be fooled by its lack of an interactive screen: the Sprint-9 Pro still synchronises running data with services such as Zwift, Strava and Kinomap (as well as connecting to Bluetooth heart-rate monitors). You just have to provide your own technology to make the most of these features.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it doesn’t have easy-to-reach adjustment dials for speed and incline, and the built-in heart-rate sensors aren’t the most comfortable to hold.\n\nDimensions: 84 x 195 x 155cm (WLH)\nWeight: 125kg\nRunning area: 55 x 152cm\nMax speed: 22km/h\nMax incline: 11%\nFolding: no\nBuilt-in entertainment: no\n\nFolding treadmills can lack the build quality and premium features of their non-collapsible counterparts, but the Pro 9000 is one of the few that aims to pack in the tech. A 3.6hp motor doesn’t want for power, offering a 22km/h top speed and a respectable 12% incline, while the deck features ReBound Pro Cushioning for a little flex underfoot to protect the joints.\n\nThere’s a compromise when it comes to running deck space, though, as it’s slightly narrower than larger, fixed treadmills. However, folding it up is a simple process and, when placed in its upright position, it can be rolled into a cupboard or stored against a wall to free up space.\n\nWhy we love it\nIt’s easy to scrimp on features when producing a folding treadmill, but ProForm packs a lot in here … not to mention an impressive running experience. The motor is plenty powerful enough, with a top speed that rivals anything here, while the Digital Quick Decline/Incline control is great for brutal hill sprint sessions. The deck is great at reaching the desired incline or decline at speed.\n\nProForm has long partnered with iFit, which provides a similar on-demand and live workout environment to Peloton and Technogym. This can be accessed via the wifi-enabled 21.5in HD colour touchscreen display. Users will have to pay a separate monthly subscription, though.\n\nProForm allows access to several streaming services with the touchscreen, as well as the ability to stream music through the twin 2in speakers mounted just below the screen. However, don’t expect mind-blowing performance from these, as it’s often best to stick a pair of headphones on instead.\n\nIt’s a shame that … it’s not lighter to make packing away a little easier – and the built-in cooling fan is borderline useless.\n\nDimensions: 90 x 196 x 151cm (WLH)\nWeight: 119kg\nRunning area: 51 x 152cm\nMax speed: 22km/h \nMax incline: 12%\nFolding: yes\nBuilt-in entertainment: yes\n\nBest for: running app aficionados\n\nThe T900D is one of the sports brand’s most robust units. It offers pro-grade running speeds and max inclines that can rival more expensive treadmills, and it folds for convenient storage.\n\nIt lacks the connected pizazz of some of the models I’ve tested, and the big, often difficult-to-operate buttons and basic display make it feel like a throwback to treadmills of yore. Yet it performs admirably, offering a generous deck for taller people, as well as simple connectivity with third-party apps, such as Strava and Kinomap.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … the build quality isn’t as hardy, and it’s not the nicest piece of design.\n\nDimensions: 88 x 185 x 147cm (WLH); weight: 89kg; running area: 50 x 143cm; max speed: 18km/h; max incline: 10%; folding: yes; built-in entertainment: no\n\nBest for: withstanding everyday use\n\nLife Fitness is a common sight in UK gyms and this exact model is in place in one of the fitness facilities I use weekly. It has a basic LCD screen that provides all the running data most users demand, and sessions can be programmed, with control over incline and speeds.\n\nThe build quality is excellent – it’s able to withstand regular punishment – but that is reflected in the price, especially considering the rather basic nature of its built-in programmes and lack of connected features. This is just a good old-fashioned treadmill, which is less likely to cause reliability headaches than some cheaper rivals.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it looks great in a commercial gym, but it’s too basic and bulky for the home.\n\nDimensions: 88 x 202 x 147cm (WLH); weight: 111kg; running area: 51 x 153cm; max speed: 19km/h; max incline: 15%; folding: yes; built-in entertainment: no\n\nBest for: immersive training without the big screen\n\nThis is another folding option that follows the ProForm line of thinking – chiefly, a solid running experience without the additional cost of a large touchscreen display. Instead, users are encouraged to tether a smartphone or tablet and make the most of the iFit app, which requires a monthly subscription but opens up the chance to take part in live classes and on-demand workouts. Weighing 90kg, the EXP5i is, however, lighter than the ProForm Pro 9000, and I found it easier to wheel around. The build quality is also excellent.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … the running deck is shorter and narrower than many competitors, while the 16km/h top speed will disappoint sprinters.\n\nDimensions: 87 x 180 x 152cm (WLH); weight: 90kg; running area: 51 x 140cm; max speed: 16km/h; max incline: 10%; folding: yes; built-in entertainment: no\n\nBest for: premium quality and all-encompassing workouts\n\nThis Italian manufacturer loves nothing more than taking standard gym kit and injecting it with some serious, athlete-inspired smarts. The latest Technogym Run features a slat belt deck, which is not only more cushioning on the knees and other joints but also offers the quietest indoor running experience I have ever tested.\n\nSitting at the premium end of the spectrum, many will balk at the Run’s asking price. But this machine goes beyond merely offering a platform to run on because of its ability to mimic a weighted sled with its Multidrive resistance technology. When set in this mode, users can strengthen muscles in the lower body or intersperse sled work with sprints for high-intensity interval training.\n\nIn addition, Technogym offers access to all its live and on-demand classes, scenic virtual runs and off-tread workouts, which include strength training, yoga and more. Pair it with the firm’s other intelligent fitness equipment and you’ll have one of the smartest setups around.\n\nIt didn’t make the final cut because … it’s priced way beyond what most mere mortals can afford.\n\nDimensions: 83 x 197 x 175cm (WLH); weight: 207kg; running area: 51 x 173cm; max speed: 25km/h; max incline: 15%; folding: no; built-in entertainment: yes, with the Technogym app store allowing access to YouTube, Disney+, Spotify and many more\n\nThere’s a treadmill to suit most budgets, but those with touchscreen displays and interactive features will cost more. The same goes for the most powerful motors, advanced running deck technology and greater connectivity features, as these all demand healthier budgets.\n\nThe most affordable treadmills generally start at about £500 – anything less than that isn’t typically worth your money. Prices then rise to £3,000 or more (see the Technogym Run) for the most technologically advanced and commercial-grade units.\n\nThe smallest treadmill on this list still measures 70 x 152 x 125cm (WLH) and you will want to factor in some wriggle room around that to ensure your arms aren’t bashing against a wall and your head isn’t hitting the ceiling. If storage space is a problem, take a look at the folding treadmills on this list. Typically, they fold flat and feature wheels so that they can be rolled into a more convenient space and stored upright to keep the floor clear.\n\nMore serious runners should look at more powerful motors because they often provide the fastest running speeds and a more natural running experience. Incline and decline features are great for mimicking runs out in the wild, and a well-cushioned deck is important for protecting the joints.\n\nMost manufacturers don’t cite figures for decibel levels emitted during operation, but it’s worth considering that some treadmills are quieter than others. Finally, connected features are fantastic for keeping track of training, ensuring runs are interesting and generally entertaining during an arduous workout. However, that doesn’t mean you necessarily need a massive display, as tethering a tablet or a smartphone can do just as good a job.\n\nIt’s always best to consult the user manual for details on how to lubricate a treadmill belt and how often to do so, as some brands produce systems that don’t need any maintenance and this could void a warranty.\n\nUse a 100% silicone lubricant that the manufacturer supplies, or buy a dedicated treadmill lubricant to avoid damaging the belt. Unplug the treadmill, lift the edges of the treadmill belt and apply lubricant in a zigzag fashion to the centre where your feet strike. Turn on the treadmill and walk slowly for about two minutes to allow the lubricant to work its way across the entirety of the running deck.\n\nWhile a treadmill can be used for walking, it’s typically more versatile than a walking pad in that it can support jogging sessions and faster training. Higher-end treadmills will also have more features than a walking pad, such as the ability to automatically adjust incline and decline, connect to on-demand workout programmes from the likes of Peloton and iFit, and offer built-in workouts. On the other hand, walking pads are usually smaller and easier to store, with some folding in half so they can be housed underneath a desk when not in use.\n\nFor more:\n\n The best running watches\n\n The best cross trainers\n\nLeon Poultney has been traversing the worlds of consumer technology and automotive for some of the biggest lifestyle websites and magazines for longer than he cares to divulge.

    "fullText": "Alphabet reports $34.5bn profit and revenue soars 48% in recent quarter as it plans a sharp increase in AI spending\n\nGoogle’s parent company, Alphabet, beat Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, and is planning a sharp increase in capital spending in 2026 as it continues to invest deeply in AI infrastructure.\n\nAlphabet on Wednesday reported profit of $34.5bn in the recently ended quarter, as revenue from cloud computing soared 48%.\n\nThe company also forecast spending between $175bn and $185bn this year, a figure much higher than analysts’ expectations of roughly $115bn.\n\nIn an earnings call, investors pressed Alphabet’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, on the significant increase. “We’ve been supply constrained, even as we’ve been ramping up our capacity. Obviously, our CapEx spend this year is an eye towards the future,” Pichai said, in response. “We are constantly planning for the long-term.” Pichai added that he expects Google to “go through the year in a supply-constrained way”.\n\nAlphabet’s chief financial officer, Anat Ashkenazi, elaborated on the ways Google is trying to free up capital. According to Ashkenazi, that includes constructing its own data centers “to ensure that we do it in the most efficient way”, having an AI-powered tool known as a “coding agent” write about half the company’s codes (before being reviewed by engineers), and using AI across departments, even for smaller tasks such as handling invoices.\n\n“We’re seeing our AI investments and infrastructure drive revenue and growth across the board, Pichai said.\n\nAlphabet’s annual revenue exceeded $400bn for the first time, Pichai added.\n\nThe company reported $113.83bn in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2025 – surpassing Wall Street estimates of $111.43bn. Earnings per share (EPS) also beat Wall Street expectations: the company reported $2.82 in EPS, compared with estimates of $2.63.\n\nThe report comes after several months of good news for the company in the AI race.\n\nThe newest version of Gemini, released by Google in November, is considered to be at the forefront of the generative AI industry, a development that has prompted panic at competitor OpenAI. Alphabet’s stock jumped 3% when Google debuted the model.\n\nThen in January, Google and Apple announced the company will start using Gemini to power AI features like Siri; the Apple assistant has previously faced criticism for not being as advanced and accurate as its competitors. Google’s valuation shot up to $4tn after the deal, making it the second-most-valuable company in the world.\n\nAnalysts viewed the multi-year agreement as a huge win for Google: the tech giant beat out competitors like OpenAI, and got access to Apple’s user base of 2.5bn active devices.\n\n“Gemini is becoming the AI engine for the world’s most successful software companies,” Pichai said on Wednesday.\n\nAlphabet’s projected spending on AI infrastructure means its capital expenditure could as much as double this year. Shares were volatile in after-hours trading, with investors weighing the swell in spending against surging revenue and profit.\n\nLike larger rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure, Google Cloud has been grappling with capacity constraints, and Pichai said the expenditures were necessary “to meet customer demand and capitalize on the growing opportunities we have ahead of us”.\n\nBut investors have increasingly grown concerned about payoffs from AI investments, as the big cloud companies collectively spend massive amounts building out their infrastructure. Meta last week hiked capital investment for AI development this year by 73%.\n\nAs the AI arms race heats up, Google’s Gemini AI assistant app exceeded 750 million users per month, Pichai said, up by 100 million compared with November.\n\nThe driverless car division Waymo is working to integrate the AI model, and Google announced that its Chrome browser will adapt more Gemini AI features, too.\n\nGoogle is still dealing with scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators; the company has faced years of legal battles with US antitrust regulators over allegations it built an illegal monopoly over online search and advertising. That fight resurged this week when the Department of Justice and several states filed an appeal to a landmark antitrust ruling last year, in which a judge imposed only modest limits on the company’s contracts. The federal government wanted tougher restrictions. Google executives did not discuss the legal proceedings on the earnings call.",

    "fullText": "Michael Saylor’s $10 million Bitcoin claim sparks backlash.\n\nIt comes as Strategy’s losses deepen as Bitcoin price slides.\n\nWhether Saylor will sell Bitcoin remains possible.\n\nMichael Saylor, executive chairman of the Bitcoin-focused firm Strategy, is facing renewed criticism. He claimed that BTC would surge to $10 million “tomorrow” if people agreed with his views.\n\nThis comes even as his company’s Bitcoin holdings slide into multibillion-dollar unrealized losses and its share price continues to fall.\n\nThe comments, made in a recent video, have drawn sharp backlash online as tension between Saylor’s long-term Bitcoin thesis and the financial strain on Strategy’s balance sheet reaches boiling point.\n\nIn the video, Saylor described Bitcoin’s price volatility as a feature rather than a flaw, arguing it benefits committed investors while deterring short-term participants.\n\n“Volatility was a gift to the faithful,” Saylor said, adding that sharp price swings scare away “tourists” and those unwilling to commit time and effort to understanding Bitcoin.\n\nSaylor went on to suggest that Bitcoin’s price was being held back by a lack of consensus.\n\n“If people in the rest of the world knew what I know, and they understood and they agreed with me, Bitcoin would go to $10 million tomorrow,” he said.\n\nHe argued that such a move would ultimately harm long-term investors by eliminating years of opportunity to accumulate Bitcoin at lower prices.\n\n“I want you to think about how you would feel and how your viewers would feel, because you would lose 20 years of stacking opportunity during which you get to buy it less than $10 million,” he said.\n\nSaylor’s remarks triggered a wave of criticism on social media, where users questioned his logic and mindset as Bitcoin’s price continues to fall.\n\nOne post responded sarcastically: “If everyone knew what I knew and agreed with me about the value of something I own I’d be worth $10 trillion.”\n\nAnother compared Bitcoin to speculative bubbles of the past, writing: “Very sad for those that follow him. At least tulips are beautiful.”\n\nOther critics focused on technical and economic concerns surrounding Bitcoin.\n\nOne user said Saylor ignored “non-competitive energy costs versus AI, halving destroying miner economics, and increasing centralization.”\n\nAnother called Saylor “the most insufferable person on the planet right now.”",

    "fullText": "MADRID/LISBON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - An elderly man died in flood waters in Portugal and a woman was swept away by a swollen river in Spain after trying to rescue her dog, ​as Storm Leonardo lashed the Iberian peninsula with heavy rains and strong winds on Thursday.\n\nLeonardo ‌is the latest in a wave of half a dozen winter storms to hit Portugal and Spain since the start of 2026, killing ‌several people, ripping roofs off homes and flooding towns.\n\nA man of around 70 died on Wednesday in Portugal's southern Alentejo region after his car was swept away on a flooded road near a dam, Portuguese authorities said.\n\nIn southern Spain's Malaga province, a woman was missing after she was dragged away by the Turvilla river's strong current while ⁠trying to rescue her dog.\n\n\"We spent ‌the whole afternoon and night yesterday searching in the river from the place where the woman fell in until the very end of the river. We found the dog, ‍but not her,\" Malaga fire chief Manuel Marmolejo said on Spanish television.\n\nA search party of more than 30 people using helicopters and drones was still searching for her, police said.\n\nSpain's Deputy Prime Minister Maria Jesus Montero said 148 roads had ​been affected by lane closures, especially in Cadiz province, and 3,500 police have been deployed to help ‌with evacuations.\n\nSTORM MARTA THE NEXT TO HIT IBERIA\n\nStorm Marta, the next weather front in the so-called \"storm train\", is expected to hit the region over the weekend, according to state weather agency Aemet.\n\nReconstruction costs in Portugal after last week's Storm Kristin alone could total over 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion), Economy Minister Manuel Castro Almeida said.\n\nPeople waded waist-deep through Alcacer do Sal in southern Portugal after successive storms caused the river Sado to breach its ⁠banks. Restaurant terraces were completely underwater, with sandbags stacked in front ​of doors to protect homes and shops.\n\n\"I've never seen anything ​like this. It's surreal,\" said resident Maria Cadacha. \"There are a lot of people here, very good people, many shopkeepers, homes with damage. I wouldn't want to be in their shoes.\"\n\nFourteen ‍rivers and 10 dams were ⁠at \"extreme\" risk of overflowing, Antonio Sanz, head of the regional government's interior department said on Wednesday.\n\nSeville on Thursday closed the Guadalquivir river floodgates to protect the historic neighborhood of Triana from flooding, only ⁠the second time it has done so since their construction in 2011.\n\nPolice cordoned off an area around Seville's cathedral after pieces from ‌its Giralda bell tower fell due to strong winds.",

    "fullText": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Russian missiles and drones have pounded Ukraine’s energy grid in recent weeks, plunging people into frozen darkness in one of the country’s coldest winters on record.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of illegally targeting power infrastructure during the war to deny civilians light, heating and running water.\n\n\"Taking advantage of the coldest days of winter to terrorize people is more important to Russia than diplomacy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday, on the eve of a new round of talks about ending the conflict and as temperatures in Kyiv hovered around minus 20 C (minus 3 F).\n\nRussia says its attacks are a legitimate part of its military campaign against its neighbor. Moscow's invasion of Ukraine itself is widely regarded as an illegal act of aggression.\n\nSo, are attacks on energy installations allowed during war?\n\nCombatants can legally target a power grid if the attack “directly affects a valid military target” — but they cannot cause excessive civilian casualties, said David Crane, former chief prosecutor at the United Nations Special Court for Sierra Leone.\n\nIn the case of Russia's attacks on Ukraine, “the indiscriminate and widespread targeting does not come close to what is legal,” he said in an emailed response to questions from The Associated Press.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross says that parts of energy systems providing essential services to civilians “are in principle civilian objects, and as such are protected against direct attack and reprisals as well as incidental harm.”\n\nPretrial judges from the International Criminal Court, in fact, issued arrest warrants in 2024 for top Russian military brass and the country’s former defense minister for their alleged involvement in missile strikes targeting electricity infrastructure.\n\nIn announcing warrants for former Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Russia’s chief military officer, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the court said that judges found “reasonable grounds to believe that the alleged strikes were directed against civilian objects, and for those installations that may have qualified as military objectives at the relevant time, the expected incidental civilian harm and damage would have been clearly excessive to the anticipated military advantage.”\n\nRussia is not a member of the court, rejects its jurisdiction, and refuses to extradite suspects to face justice in the ICC’s courtrooms in The Hague, Netherlands.\n\nThe Russian military has repeatedly said that it has targeted energy facilities and other infrastructure that support Ukrainian military industries and armed forces. It has denied targeting residential areas despite daily evidence to the contrary.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted Wednesday that “our military is striking the targets that they believe are associated with the military complex of the Kyiv regime, the operation is continuing.”\n\nKyiv accuses Russia of seeking to wear down Ukrainians’ appetite for the fight by inflicting grinding hardship on civilians forced to live in dark, freezing homes.\n\nAuthorities say Russia has tried to cripple Ukraine's electricity network by targeting substations, transformers, turbines and generators at power plants. Ukraine’s largest private power company, DTEK, said that this week's overnight attack was the ninth major assault on the company’s thermal power plants since October.\n\nUkraine’s energy sector has suffered more than $20 billion in direct war damage, according to a joint estimate by the World Bank, the European Commission and the United Nations.",

    "fullText": "After a run of just 17 points in his past seven games, Erling Haaland is dropped from this FPL team of the week.\n\nJust one goal in seven games, he only managed two shots last week and faces Liverpool away - it seems an easy choice.\n\nIt's a much harder choice for FPL managers to decide what to do with the Norwegian in the long run and I'd still hold him - with a nice run of games after this one - unless you really need the money elsewhere.\n\nThe other priority for managers is to make sure you have a plan to get to three Arsenal players in time for next week, when they have a double gameweek along with Wolves.\n\nThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.\n\nDon't miss our FPL special Q&A with expert Gianni Buttice, live on the BBC Sport website on Friday, 6 February at 15:30 GMT.\n\nLed by captain Fernandes (20 points), strong returns from Gabriel (8), Enzo Fernandez (8), James Hill (7) and Antoine Semenyo (7) resulted in a tidy 64 points all out.\n\nDavid Raya, Arsenal, keeper, £5.9m - Sunderland (h)\n\nGabriel, Arsenal, defender, £7m - Sunderland (h)\n\nJurrien Timber, Arsenal, defender, £6.3m - Sunderland (h)\n\nWith Bukayo Saka having injury issues and Declan Rice failing to produce in recent matches, it is an Arsenal triple-up in defence this week against a Sunderland side with just six goals on the road this season.\n\nDon't expect more than six points from Raya, but he is a very steady choice while Gabriel and Timber have well-known attacking threat.\n\nIf this comes off, 20-plus points between the three of them is a possibility.\n\nMarc Cucurella, Chelsea, £6m - Wolves (a)\n\nThe Spaniard got his first goal of the season against West Ham (he scored five in 2024-25). Will this be the start of more attacking production from him?\n\nWolves are low scorers at home, Chelsea have 10 clean sheets this season.\n\nBruno Fernandes (captain), Manchester United, £9.6m - Tottenham (h)\n\nHe produced last week and gets the armband again in a United team that you feel could score three in any game on current form - even if their defence is shaky.\n\nThere's no point going through all his statistics over and over again but it is safe to say the Portugal midfielder is head and shoulders above everyone else in terms of creativity.\n\nOnly Fernandes (12) and Bayern Munich's Michael Olise (14) have reached double figures for assists in Europe's top five league this season.\n\nMatheus Cunha, Manchester United, £8m - Tottenham (h)\n\nBack-to-back nine-pointers for the Brazilian means he gets the nod ahead of Bryan Mbeumo (£8.4m) and Amad Diallo (£6.2m) as a second United attacking option.\n\nCunha has had the most shots per 90 minutes on the pitch (3.69) of any United midfielder - Mbeumo is next on 2.65. Cunha has had more shots (61) than any other midfielder in the league too.\n\nAnd he feels like the least likely of the trio to get a rest if Benjamin Sesko is recalled to the starting line-up following his match-winning goal v Fulham.\n\nEnzo Fernandez, Chelsea, £6.8m - Wolves (a)\n\nAnother great fixture for Chelsea and Fernandez just keeps producing, with returns in five of his past six games.\n\nStill has the highest expected goals (xG) among midfielders with 8.91 and is still just a cracking all-round pick, especially at the price.\n\nYasin Ayari, Brighton, £4.8m - Crystal Palace (h)\n\nThe 22-year-old Swede has turned into an FPL bargain recently.\n\nAyari has returned in his past four games, including two double-digit hauls.\n\nHe's also in and about getting defensive contribution points (defcon) in every game. In his past seven games, he's earned defcon three times and twice come within one point of getting it.\n\nAll for £4.8m - wildcarders pay attention.\n\nElliot Anderson, Nottingham Forest, £5.3m - Leeds (a)\n\nAnother budget gem FPL managers should be looking at more closely.\n\nAnderson has earned defcon points in his past eight games.\n\nHe's pretty much a lock for two extra points in every match so you are starting from a base of four points before he does anything in an attacking sense.\n\nJoao Pedro, Chelsea, £7.5m - Wolves (a)\n\nThe Brazilian has been on fire in his past three league games, with three goals, two assists and 30 points.\n\nThe main worry with Joao Pedro in the past 10 games has been whether he'll start, as he has been benched four times, but after coming on at half-time to rescue Chelsea against West Ham last week you'd like to think he'll be first choice again.\n\nAnd with Wolves away, Leeds at home and then Burnley at home in the next three, fixture runs don't come much better.\n\nHe's a good captain choice this week too if you don't have Fernandes.\n\nJarrod Bowen, West Ham, £7.6m - Burnley (a)\n\nBowen is another striker in hot form, with 20 points in his past two.\n\nLikewise, West Ham have two wins in three, scoring seven goals in the process, and were unlucky not to take something in Saturday's 3-2 loss at Chelsea.\n\nSo a good time for the Hammers and Bowen to take on the league's second-worst defence in Burnley.\n\nMartin Dubravka, Burnley, keeper, £4m - West Ham (h)\n\nRaul Jimenez, Fulham, striker, £6.2m - Everton (h)\n\nJames Tarkowski, Everton, defender, £5.8m - Fulham (a)\n\nJoe Rodon, Leeds, defender, £3.9m - Nottingham Forest (h)\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

    "fullText": "\"I'd rather fight than do interviews.\"\n\nThis short, sharp sentence tells you everything you need to know about Hassan Ishaq.\n\nIn an era of influencer boxing, where manufactured social media feuds can outshine the sport itself, the 22-year-old super-bantamweight from Slough has little interest in clout or cameras.\n\n\"I'm not used to the spotlight. I just love the sweet science of boxing,\" he tells BBC Sport.\n\nMastering the art of self-promotion will come in time but, for now, Ishaq is backed by a team determined to ensure his talent does not go unnoticed.\n\nFrank Warren, a promoter who has navigated the shark-infested waters of British boxing for 45 years, is guiding Ishaq's first steps in the paid ranks. And in trainer Huzaifah Iqbal, he has a voice outside the ropes - a hype man, strategist and mentor rolled into one.\n\n\"Hassan's going to be pound-for-pound one of the world's best,\" says a beaming Iqbal.\n\n\"A multi-weight world champion like Manny Pacquiao, inshallah. One day, we'll have Michael Buffer introducing Hassan and listing all the belts in all the divisions.\"\n\n5 Live Boxing: Kelly becomes champion as Big Baby loses his lid\n\n'Spooky premonitions' drive unfancied Kelly to top of boxing mountain\n\nEdwards to fight Powar for British title on BBC\n\nTalent, belief and dedication can take a fighter far but making smart decisions early on will determine the height of Ishaq's ceiling.\n\nIqbal describes the transition from amateur to professional as a \"delicate\" stage, where careers are often made or broken.\n\n\"The first five or six fights are the real transition,\" he says. \"The work Hassan does in the gym now - and with the sparring partners we bring in – is more important than later.\n\n\"As you get older, your muscles become cemented. It's harder to change.\"\n\nCrucially, Iqbal believes the trainer must be involved when it comes to match-making, making sure opponents aid development rather than simply pad a record.\n\n\"Boxing is a messed-up sport. Sometimes managers who have never boxed find opponents,\" he says.\n\n\"But it should be the coach, because the coach knows the fighter's strengths and weaknesses.\"\n\nEven the sport's greats needed learning nights. Pacquiao's first three bouts went to points. In his second pro fight, Floyd Mayweather went the four-round distance with awkward southpaw Reggie Sanders and had to deal with a cut in the third.\n\n\"We want opponents who make Hassan show what he can do. Who can test his grit and take his power. Hassan can box with both hands and we want someone who throws something back so he can slip, counter and whack.\" Iqbal adds.\n\n\"We have to remember he's only 22 but if he continues to keep pushing and learning, he will go all the way.\"\n\nIshaq will be searching for a third consecutive stoppage win on the undercard of featherweight Nick Ball's world title defence against Brandon Figueroa in Liverpool on Saturday.\n\nA three-time England national champion and gold medallist at the prestigious Haringey Box Cup, he boasts strong amateur pedigree.\n\nSuch is the buzz around him that the end of his amateur career was marked with a celebration event in London which included messages of encouragement from heavyweight titan Anthony Joshua and unbeaten middleweight star Hamzah Sheeraz.\n\nYet for all his amateur success, Ishaq never considered staying on to chase Olympic glory.\n\n\"I had about 50 fights and won about 40,\" he says. \"But I felt like in the amateurs, I used to get robbed a lot. Decisions never went my way and it disheartened me.\"\n\nThat disillusionment led him to the professional ranks. Nicknamed 'Shooter', Ishaq describes himself as a \"thinker\" rather than a brawler.\n\n\"I'll be a world champion within five years, 100%. I know what I'm capable of,\" he says, his quiet manner not to be mistaken for a lack of ambition.\n\nIshaq fights out of the New Era Gym in Surrey under Iqbal, one of the sport's brightest young coaches.\n\nA former professional himself, Iqbal won his lone bout in 2019 before serving a lengthy apprenticeship under the tutelage of world-class coach Adam Booth.\n\nWelterweight world champion Lewis Crocker has recently joined Iqbal's stable and the trainer says the IBF belt-holder is one of many \"elite fighters who turn their necks when Hassan is sparring\".\n\nIqbal points to the 'Philly Shell' - the shoulder-roll defence popularised by Mayweather - as the foundation of Ishaq's game.\n\nPhilly Shell is a high-IQ style built around making opponents miss by inches and punishing the mistake.\n\n\"A lot of Philly Shell fighters are purely counter-punchers and aren't very aggressive,\" Iqbal explains.\n\n\"But Hassan trusts his power. He has that defensive mindset but he can switch to offence at any moment. That's what makes him stand out.\"\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

It was just not our time this year, but very well could have been.\n\n\"We have qualified for the World Championships in the relay so will be looking to make amends there in March.\"",

    "fullText": "Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend has played down a report that he has agreed to take over at Newcastle Red Bulls after the World Cup.\n\nTownsend already has a part-time consultancy role with Newcastle but the Daily Telegraph has reported, external that he will take over full time - most likely as a director of rugby - when his Scottish Rugby Union contract expires in 2027.\n\nTownsend advises Newcastle on strategy and philosophy and several of his key allies have already been recruited by the ambitious club, which was taken over by the energy drinks manufacturer last year.\n\nHe is under pressure as Scotland coach as he prepares for the Six Nations following a disappointing autumn series that included his side being booed off at Murrayfield after surrendering a 21-0 lead against Argentina.\n\nHowever the former Scotland stand-off, who took over as head coach of the national team in 2017, has denied he has put pen to paper on a deal with Newcastle.\n\n\"It's pure speculation, I've not signed a contract beyond the World Cup with anybody,\" Townsend said as he announced his team for their Six Nations opener against Italy.\n\n\"It's a story that is being put out there to try to disrupt before the Italy game or next week's game against England.\n\n\"It's just something that comes out, things like these, before the England game in particular.\n\n\"There's no truth I've signed the contract beyond the World Cup and my focus is on the Scotland team right now and hopefully up to the World Cup.\"\n\nNewcastle have signed 16 players for next season, including England scrum-half Raffi Quirke from Sale Sharks, New Zealand forward Hoskins Sotutu and Fiji winger Joji Nasova.\n\nScotland leave out Van der Merwe, Kinghorn & Graham\n\nAnalysis by BBC Scotland's chief sports writer Tom English\n\n\"Speculation\" is an interesting word for Gregor Townsend to use regarding the report in the Daily Telegraph.\n\nHe hasn't signed a deal with anybody, he says. And it's all a tactic to disrupt Scotland before the Six Nations.\n\nSorry, but I'm not sure anybody is buying that one. Has he committed to signing a deal?\n\nHe hasn't exactly blown this story out of the water with \"speculation\" and obfuscation. There's probably a reason for that.\n\nThe report in the Daily Telegraph just supports everything we have heard on the grapevine.\n\nBut if Scotland start well in the Six Nations then what he does in 2027 is not going to have much of an impact. Nobody will care.\n\nIf they start badly then all sorts will get thrown at him in the here and now - distracted by his links with Red Bull and Newcastle and so on.\n\nScotland's rising star poised for sliding doors moment\n\n'Uncage the gorilla' - Schoeman knows what Scots must improve\n\nTownsend said form was behind the surprise selections in his back three for the Italy game in Rome on Saturday.\n\nDuhan van der Merwe and Darcy Graham - Scotland's top two try-scorers - as well as British and Irish Lions Test full-back Blair Kinghorn have been omitted.\n\nTom Jordan will play at full-back with Glasgow Warriors wingers Kyle Steyn and Jamie Dobie on the flanks.\n\n\"Blair, Duhan and Darcy have had some terrific games for us and they're very proud playing for Scotland. But there is competition in that back three area as there is in other positions,\" said Townsend.\n\n\"We feel Jamie, Kyle, and Tom deserve their starts given how well they've been playing.\n\n\"Selection is about giving players opportunities and they've earned it. All three of them individually have taken games to the opposition, worked really hard at areas really important at Test level.\n\n\"But the three that weren't selected are quality players. How they've trained over the last few weeks will be positive for the future if and when they get back into the team.\"",

    "description": "World champion Lando Norris is anticipating \"more chaos in races\" as a result of new rule changes in Formula 1 next season.",
    "fullText": "World champion Lando Norris says he expects \"more chaos in races\" this year as a result of the new rules introduced to Formula 1.\n\nThe sport has its biggest regulation change in history, with engines, chassis, fuel and tyres all subject to new requirements.\n\nEnergy management of the battery will be a central feature, with engines that now have more of their total power output provided by the electrical hybrid elements.\n\nBriton Norris said: \"You're going to see more chaos in races where a driver has to be a little bit more on top of all of these different situations that can happen.\n\n\"And that will happen through the whole year, I would say. There's more emphasis on drivers' ability to control all of these things.\"\n\nThe McLaren driver said the use of the new 'boost button', which gives an extra burst of electrical energy, and the effect that has on the battery's state of charge will be central to the new format of F1.\n\n\"You'll be able to force people \n\n\"And that's probably a better thing, a good thing.\"\n\nNorris is basing his early assessment of the cars on the 'shakedown' test that was held in Barcelona last week. There are two further three-day pre-season tests in Bahrain over the next two weeks, starting on 11 February.\n\nHe says the new engines and the need to manage energy could lead to drivers swapping positions more often.\n\n\"You'll see more yo-yoing, more moves with extra speed. But then that person might have to defend more than what you've seen in the past and that will create more chaos, which is great for you guys,\" he added.\n\nThe engines are still 1.6-litre V6 turbo hybrids, as they have been since 2014, but one of the two electrical motors that recovered energy has been removed.\n\nThe total amount of electrical energy has been increased by a factor of three, but the battery is more or less the same size. If the battery is fully depleted, the engine loses 350kw (470bhp), leading to potentially dramatic speed differentials.\n\nDrivers will be backing off towards the end of straights - and being careful about when they apply the throttle - to ensure the most efficient energy usage, even on a qualifying lap.\n\nThe cars are also smaller and lighter, have less downforce and have 'active aerodynamics' - where both front and rear wings open on the straights to increase speed and the possibility for energy recovery.\n\nNorris said the new car \"certainly feels more powerful and quicker\" on the straight.\n\n\"The biggest challenge at the minute is battery management and knowing how to utilise that in the best way,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not simple. You can explain it in quite simple terms. It's just you have a very powerful battery that doesn't last very long, so knowing how to use it in the right times, how much energy, how much of that power you use, how you split it up around the lap...\n\n\"The biggest challenge is how you can recover the batteries as well as possible, and that's when it comes down to using the gears, hitting the right revs.\n\n\"Obviously, you've got some turbo lag now, which we've never really had before. All of these little things have crept back in, but I don't think that changes too much.\n\n\"In a perfect world, I probably wouldn't have [all] that in a race car, but it's just F1. Sometimes you have these different challenges.\"\n\nHis team-mate Oscar Piastri said the cars were \"not as alien as I think we might have feared\" and insisted he \"didn't think F1 had lost its identity at all\".\n\nThe Australian added: \"There's going to be some things to get used to but in terms of some of the fears that maybe we had before we got on track, a significant majority of those have been alleviated now.\n\n\"There'll be some differences, but I think fundamentally they're still the fastest cars in the world.\"\n\nBarcelona 'shakedown' offers first hints of F1 2026\n\nActive aero and overtake mode - F1's new terminology\n\nThe reduced downforce has lowered cornering speeds and ensured some of the quicker corners, where drivers did not have to slow down before, will be more challenging.\n\nNorris said: \"Quite a lot more corners that were easy flat in previous years or the last few years are going to become much bigger corners again.\n\n\"So that's a good thing in some ways and therefore you can see more racing.\n\n\"But you might have different strategies because what was then flat last year and not really a grip-limited section, now when you put a new set of tyres on you'll be able to gain in a lot more parts of the track.\"\n\nNorris won his first title last year in a close season-long battle with Piastri and Red Bull's Max Verstappen.\n\nThe 26-year-old said he was revelling in the fact he had achieved his \"life's ambition\" and was keen to continue his success.\n\n\"If I don't achieve something again, I always have something that I'm very proud about. If anything, I enjoyed last year a lot - and of course I really want to do it again.\"\n\nNorris' success in 2025 was the consequence of a big step in performance in the second half of the season, after assiduous work with his team on improving following a difficult first few races.\n\n\"I'm always trying to improve on my things,\" he said. \"I know there's still areas that I'm not at the level I need to be - and it's still a good level - but when you're fighting these guys, you need to be close to perfection. There's still plenty of things I want to work on and I want to be better on, but the baseline level of where I'm at now is already pretty good.\n\n\"My motivation to win is exactly the same. I've definitely not lost anything and, if anything, I think I just have more confidence because I've said in interviews and stuff in the past that I'm very much a guy who has to see something to believe it, especially when it's been on anything to do with myself.\"\n\nRussell 'wants to go head-to-head' with Verstappen\n\nVowles 'not concerned at all' at missing test\n\nBiggest rule change ever and Brit teen - what's new in F1 in 2026?",

    "description": "With the T20 World Cup beginning on Saturday, BBC Sport looks at the trends and tactics from the global game that may play a part in India and Sri Lanka.",
    "fullText": "It may be just 19 months since India lifted the T20 World Cup in Barbados but the latest edition begins in Colombo on Saturday.\n\nAs ever, the tournament in India and Sri Lanka will likely be one of sixes and runs.\n\nBefore it all begins, we have taken a look at what has been going on in international and franchise games over recent years and predicted some trends and tactics to watch out for...\n\nThe option for a team to call in a batter who is struggling and chewing up too many balls has always been there.\n\n2025 was the year retiring batters out hit the mainstream.\n\nThere were 26 instances of that 'dismissal' in international and domestic T20s last year - almost 50% of the total number in the history of the format.\n\nIt has also happened twice more since the turn of the year in the Big Bash, while Northern Districts retired out two batters in the same innings in New Zealand's Super Smash in January.\n\nA batter has retired out in a T20 World Cup before - in a match involving England no less - when Namibia batter Nikolaas Davin walked off to allow David Wiese to come to the middle in the 2024 group stage.\n\nBut with the stigma around the move gone, could this be the tournament of the retired out?\n\nNot since 2013 have spinners bowled as much at the death in T20s as they did in 2025.\n\nFor a long while, the death overs - regarded as the last five in an innings for this data - have been left largely to seamers and their mix of yorkers, slower balls and hard lengths. That is changing.\n\nIn 2025, 24% of balls bowled at the death in T20s between full member nations were delivered by spinners - and with some success.\n\nSpinners' economy rate at the death has dropped around 1.5 runs per over in the past two years to 7.68 runs per over. Last year, spinners had a better economy at the finish than seamers.\n\nAfghanistan, unsurprisingly given the quality of their options, have used spin regularly at the death. More than half of their deliveries in the final five overs were bowled by spinners.\n\nIndia were the next most frequent users of the tactic, followed by Sri Lanka and, interestingly, England.\n\nWhile England captain and when leading Northern Superchargers in The Hundred since 2024, Harry Brook has had spinners bowling 42.2% of his deliveries at the death.\n\nFormer captain Jos Buttler's figure in that time was just 19.7%.\n\nThis may be less of a surprise, given fast scoring and six-hitting has been on an upward trajectory since T20's inception.\n\nLast year was a big jump, however, with batting strike-rates for all players in all men's T20s tipping over 130 for the first time. The increase from 2024 was more than eight runs per 100 balls.\n\nThe introduction of the Indian Premier League's player impact rule has boosted scoring rates there - teams effectively can field an extra batter when needed - but the rise is reflected in internationals too.\n\nA six was also hit every 17.4 deliveries across all T20s last year - the figure was at 23.1 as recently as 2021.\n\nSixes are now hit more than twice as often than in the format's first year in 2003.\n\nWe are all familiar with the term match-up these days.\n\nIt has become commonplace in T20 - and increasingly in Test cricket - and describes how some batters are suited to styles of bowling and vice-versa.\n\nWhen it comes to batting against spin, the logic goes that batters are more vulnerable when facing a bowler who turns the ball away from them - a leg-spinner to right-handers and off-spinner to left-handers.\n\nWhat is interesting, however, is how all of those at the top of the T20 batting rankings, bar Australia's openers Mitchell Marsh and Travis Head as shown below, all have strong records against their perceived negative spin match-up.\n\nIndia's left-handed opener Abhishek Sharma, the world's leading T20 batter, averages 43.3 and strikes at 183.1 runs per 100 balls against off-spin in internationals since the start of 2024.\n\nEngland right-handers Phil Salt and Buttler have strike-rates of 148.4 and 136.8 respectively against left-arm spin alongside solid averages.\n\nThe trend is reflected by the leading spin bowlers too. India's Varun Chakravarthy, Rashid Khan and Adil Rashid all have similar records against right and left-handers.\n\nWhen it gets to the elite level, match-ups are not insignificant but they are not the be all and end all.\n\nAnother thing on the rise is the prevalence of left-handed batters.\n\nIn T20s between full member nations, lefties have never faced a higher percentages of deliveries than the 35% they did in 2025.\n\nThe spike is a sign of some teams switching on to the benefits of right-hand-left-hand batting combinations.\n\nIt makes shorter boundaries harder to defend, messes with bowlers' lengths and negates the threat of those spinning match-ups.\n\nAnd no team uses this more than co-hosts and overwhelming favourites India. It has been a cornerstone of Gautam Gambhir's time as coach.\n\nSince the start of 2024, left-handers have faced 51% of India's deliveries in T20s against full members - a jump from 31% under Rahul Dravid in the run up to the 2024 World Cup.\n\nEngland, in comparison, twice picked a team with only one left-hander in their XI during the tour of India last year.\n\nBut while left-handers only faced 19% of England's deliveries from the start of 2024 to the start of 2026, the selection of Ben Duckett, Jacob Bethell and Sam Curran for this World Cup - all of whom could bat in the top seven - suggests times may, belatedly, be changing.\n\nBut if England are to have any chance in India and Sri Lanka, it feels like Salt and Buttler, their two leading batters, will have to hit form.\n\nAfter Buttler's period at number three, the pair were reunited as openers at the end of last summer and, despite a quiet run for Salt in Sri Lanka, have returned impressive results.\n\nSalt hit scores of 141 not out, 85 and 89 against South Africa and Ireland. Buttler also made 83 against South Africa when an opening stand of 126 sent England on their way to a record 304-2.\n\nSalt, a notoriously aggressive starter, cuts loose from the start, striking at 149.7 in the first two overs of T20s since the start of 2024 - the third best of any opener at this World Cup.\n\nButtler, in comparison, has a strike-rate of just 105 in that time. He sits back and watches Salt do his thing.\n\nBut by the final two overs of the powerplay Buttler is often flying.\n\nThe former captain, having taken a bit of time to get in, has been striking at 172.9 in the fifth and sixth overs, even outdoing Salt's healthy strike-rate of 163.7.\n\nThe pair take on the powerplay in specific and complementary ways.\n\nLive ball-by-ball commentary of every match on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, plus live texts with in-play clips and highlights.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds built on their opening Winter Olympics mixed doubles curling win as a stunning four-point haul in the penultimate end secured victory over Estonia in Cortina.\n\nThe Team GB duo - who beat Norway in their opener on Wednesday - were kept honest by the Estonian debutants, but their class ultimately told in the latter stages to force an early end to the contest and a 10-5 triumph.\n\n\"We've played them a lot and knew we'd have to step up our performance from last night and we did that,\" Dodds told BBC Sport.\n\nThe GB duo will have a few hours off before facing the Czech Republic in their third round-robin game at 18:05 GMT on Thursday - live on the BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.\n\n\"We probably only got five or six hours sleep last night, so a nap is needed this afternoon,\" Dodds added.\n\nWinter Olympics day-by-day guide\n\n'Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower'\n\nGB started with the hammer, took two in accomplished first end, and looked like they might enjoy a comfortable start to the day in Italy.\n\nEstonia responded by doing the same, though, after a slight Dodds error with her last stone. \"Sorry, Bruce,\" said the 34-year-old, who was slightly errant again with her opening rock of the third end.\n\nBut Dodds, peerless against Norway, righted herself to deliver a magnificent final store and restore GB's two-point advantage.\n\nThe Estonians should have pulled level again, but a Marie Kaldvee mistake ensured they still trailed at the break. \"It's been a bit of back and forth,\" was how 2022 Olympic gold medallist Vicky Wright described it.\n\nKaldvee was slack again upon the resumption and Mouat - fuelled by an interval munch of mango - delivered with GB's final stone to extend the advantage to 6-3 with three ends remaining.\n\nEstonia - who overcame a four-point deficit in the final end against Switzerland in their opener - employed their powerplay in the sixth and moved back within one after capitalising on a rare Mouat error.\n\nGB played their own powerplay in response and made full use of it, a furious double sweep by both Mouat and Dodds earning a decisive four points after some deliberation with the measuring stick.\n\nThat opened up a five-point chasm, which persuaded the Estonians to shake hands and concede defeat with an end to spare.\n\n\"That was better from me today. I had a few that slipped up, but I called myself a bad word, and moved on,\" Mouat told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We're very happy with how we're performing and excited to get GB off on the right foot.\"\n\nHow Team GB Winter Olympians beat The Fear\n\nGB skeleton team appeal after new helmet shape ruled out",

    "description": "Duhan van der Merwe, Darcy Graham and Blair Kinghorn are left out of Scotland's side for the Six Nations opener against Italy.",
    "fullText": "Duhan van der Merwe and Darcy Graham - the top two try-scorers in Scotland history - as well as British and Irish Lions Test full-back Blair Kinghorn have been left out of the side for the Six Nations opener against Italy.\n\nCoach Gregor Townsend has opted for a back three of Bristol's Tom Jordan at full-back flanked by Glasgow Warriors wingers Kyle Steyn and Jamie Dobie for Saturday's game in Rome.\n\nIt will be the first start in a Six Nations game for Dobie, who has played the majority of his career as a scrum-half but who has shone for Glasgow on the wing this season.\n\nGraham is among the replacements but Van der Merwe and Kinghorn are not even in the matchday 23, with stand-off Adam Hastings and scrum-half George Horne the other backs cover.\n\nOther than the shock omissions of three 2025 Lions tourists, Townsend's selection for Scotland's first game of the championship is otherwise predictable.\n\nGrant Gilchrist, 35, has beaten off the challenges of the more youthful Gregor Brown and Max Williamson to partner Scott Cummings, who missed last year's championship through injury, in the second row.\n\nMatt Fagerson, vice-captain Rory Darge and Jack Dempsey form an all-Glasgow back row, with versatile Warriors forward Brown also covering the breakaway unit.\n\nThe back-row trio are part of a nine-strong Glasgow contingent in the starting line-up with another five Warriors on the bench.\n\nEwan Ashman, Scotland's leading try-scoring forward, gets the nod at hooker ahead of George Turner and will have Lions props Pierre Schoeman and Zander Fagerson either side of him.\n\nBen White partners vice-captain Finn Russell at half-back despite strong claims from in-form Horne.\n\nThe midfield is the familiar pairing of Huw Jones and captain Sione Tuipulotu - the 18th Test match the pair have played together.\n\nJordan (Bristol); Steyn, Jones, Tuipulotu (c), Dobie (all Glasgow); Russell (Bath), White (Toulon); Schoeman (Edinburgh), Ashman (Edinburgh), Z Fagerson (Glasgow), Cummings (Glasgow), Gilchrist (Edinburgh); M Fagerson, Darge, Dempsey (all Glasgow).\n\nReplacements: Turner (Harlequins), McBeth (Glasgow), Millar-Mills (Northampton), Williamson, Brown, Horne, Hastings (all Glasgow), Graham (Edinburgh).\n\nScotland's Townsend denies signing Newcastle deal\n\nScotland's rising star poised for sliding doors moment\n\n'Uncage the gorilla' - Schoeman knows what Scots must improve\n\nAnalysis by BBC Scotland's chief sports writer Tom English\n\nOutside Scotland, this selection is going to cause sharp intakes of breath. Maybe inside Scotland, or in parts of it, this selection is going to cause sharp intakes of breath.\n\nYes, Blair Kinghorn has been a shoo-in at 15 for the longest time, but there are mistakes in his game that tend to come tumbling out when Scotland are under the pump.\n\nThe inclusion of Tom Jordan - playing his in his third-best position after 10 and 12 - is a nod to having a more mentally robust outfit when the heat comes on. Kinghorn will get plenty of game-time in this Six Nations, but not in week one.\n\nYes, again, Darcy Graham and Duhan van der Merwe are record-breaking mainstays, but the pair of them have been dragged down by Edinburgh's malaise and, quite honestly, it would have been a shock had Kyle Steyn and Jamie Dobie not started.\n\nThey're both in flying form and are both leaders in their own way. Mental fortitude has been a problem for Scotland, but not for Glasgow.\n\nSteyn and Dobie were nailed on to start if form over reputation was any sort of guide.\n\nGrant Gilchrist survives the challenge of a battalion of second rows, but there are two seriously impressive operators to come off the bench.\n\nGregor Brown is in at cover at six but he's just as good at lock. And Max Williamson is the size of a house. You're getting great impact there. Williamson was injured this time last year and missed the entire tournament. Big chance for the big man.\n\nWith three games in three weeks and five in six weeks, Gregor Townsend is going to use his squad more than ever, I suspect.\n\nThere are a lot of top-notch players turning out for the A team on Friday night or not turning out at all this weekend.\n\nWe'll be seeing some of them down the track for sure. The schedule and the inevitability of injuries within that schedule will demand it.\n\nThat bench looks good. George Horne is having a whale of a season and what an impact he might have in Rome. Graham, if at his best, gives you massive X-factor. Adam Hastings deserves to be back in the frame.\n\nIt's encouraging on paper. Now for the reality.\n\nWatch live on BBC TV and ITV, listen to every match on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, live text and highlights on BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Chelsea and Strasbourg have completed 12 transfer deals this summer. Is it out of the ordinary, and might Fifa get involved?",
    "fullText": "When Chelsea's David Datro Fofana completed a deadline-day loan move to Strasbourg on Monday, he became the 12th transfer between the clubs this season.\n\nThe activity between the BlueCo partners has started to raise eyebrows.\n\nRather than simple loan arrangements like that of Fofana, some players have moved back and forth for fees.\n\nChelsea plucked head coach Liam Rosenior away as well, much to the annoyance of Strasbourg.\n\nThere is no suggestion there is anything untoward, and the deals have all been carried out within the rules.\n\nBut could such a high number of transfers between two teams within multi-club ownership (MCO) be a trigger for Fifa or Uefa?\n\nThe game's governing bodies are keeping a close eye on the situation.\n\nSo far action has been limited to clubs being removed from competitions where there might be a conflict of interest.\n\nLast year, Fifa disqualified Leon from the Club World Cup, and Uefa demoted Crystal Palace from the Europa League.\n\nChelsea's transfer business has been the catalyst for change in Fifa's transfer regulations once before. Could it be again?\n\nChelsea and Strasbourg came together under Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital's BlueCo group in 2023.\n\nAcross the first two years Strasbourg got the best of the deal.\n\nSix players left Chelsea for the French club, five on loan and one permanently.\n\nStrasbourg were able to spend money they could only have dreamed about.\n\nIn the three years before BlueCo, Strasbourg's total transfer fees paid per season were £6.1m, £3.9m and £9.5m.\n\nIn the following three seasons Strasbourg spent £52.6m, £53.6m and £96.5m. They were the biggest-spending club in France last summer, outgunning even Paris St-Germain (£89.2m).\n\nThose additional resources helped Strasbourg challenge for a place in the Champions League last season.\n\nBut last summer the way the two clubs did business began to change. The pendulum would swing towards the dominant MCO partner in Chelsea.\n\nTake central defender Mamadou Sarr, who in June joined Chelsea from Strasbourg on a permanent deal.\n\nThe 20-year-old made only one appearance for Chelsea as a substitute at the Fifa Club World Cup.\n\nIn August he went back to Strasbourg on loan. On Monday he was recalled by Chelsea.\n\nBlueCo would argue this is a key part of player development - that Sarr would get regular football at Strasbourg and return to Stamford Bridge a better player.\n\nThen there is the case of Ishe Samuels-Smith.\n\nThe left-back moved from Chelsea to Strasbourg in July. He was then re-signed by Chelsea in September - and immediately loaned to Swansea City.\n\nIn the world of multi-club ownership there is logic to it.\n\nWith Ben Chilwell not part of Enzo Maresca's plans the full-back was sent to Strasbourg on a free transfer. The Ligue 1 club had also resolved a contract dispute with another defender, Ismael Doukoure.\n\nIt left Samuels-Smith as a spare part in Alsace.\n\nRather than leave the 19-year-old struggling for first-team football, Chelsea effectively refunded the £6.5m transfer fee and sent him to the Championship club.\n\nClub captain Emmanuel Emegha is already confirmed to be the next on the conveyor belt to Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe 20-year-old striker, one of BlueCo's first signings at Strasbourg, will join Chelsea at the end of the season.\n\nThe club's ultras - long-time critics of the association with BlueCo - demanded he hand back the captain's armband.\n\nOutsiders see players (and indeed the head coach) jumping around from club to club at the behest of Chelsea.\n\nTake Aaron Anselmino. The centre-back spent the first half of the season on loan at Borussia Dortmund from Chelsea.\n\nYet when Chelsea wanted Sarr in their first team, Anselmino was recalled from the Bundesliga club and sent to fill the hole in the Strasbourg squad.\n\nAnselmino was reportedly in tears when he left Dortmund.\n\nChelsea were shifting chess pieces to suit their own strategy.\n\nYet recalling loan players from one club to send them to another should not be seen as special to a multi-club ownership structure.\n\nFor instance, last month Manchester United brought Harry Amass back from a loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday and sent him to Norwich City instead.\n\nChelsea's transfer business has attracted the attention of Fifa before, leading to a reshaping of the regulations in 2022.\n\nAlong with Juventus and Atalanta, Chelsea had become the poster boys of player hoarding - signing a high number of players and loaning them out.\n\nFormer Chelsea technical director Michael Emenalo had drawn up the concept of the so-called loan army. Up to 35 players were sent out on loan across Europe at any one time.\n\nFifa stepped in to \"develop young players, promote competitive balance and prevent hoarding\", and enforced a limit of six players aged over 21 who could be loaned out.\n\nMost importantly for MCOs, Fifa said a maximum of three players could be loaned to one club.\n\nChelsea would point out they have simply been fully utilising this option.\n\nBBC Sport understands that Fifa does not have any appetite to look again at its transfer regulations.\n\nIndeed, football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport that Fifa would be on \"a fairly sticky wicket\" if it was seen to be treating clubs unequally.\n\nMaguire added MCOs would simply find a way of getting around it, perhaps by changing the structure of shareholdings.\n\n\"They will find another loophole,\" Maguire said. \"It is a situation that is easy to manipulate.\"\n\nThere would be other concerns, too, with half the clubs across the top five European leagues in some kind of MCO.\n\n\"So many clubs are in MCOs that to introduce a set of rules would impinge upon them,\" Maguire added.\n\n\"Chelsea are far from the worst offenders. Take a look at the number of transactions between Watford and Udinese.\n\n\"They would say that they're not an MCO, they just happen to be owned by different parts of the family, the Pozzo family.\"\n\nWatford and Udinese are just one example of clubs outside of an MCO engaging in multiple transfers.\n\nNottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis signed four players from Botafogo in the summer. Murillo then went in the opposite direction with one of the signings, Jair Cunha, immediately going back on loan.\n\nJohn Textor, the majority owner of Botafogo, said Marinakis \"has effectively become that partner\" when discussing transfer agreements across leagues.\n\nAre fans being turned off multi-club ownership model?\n\nChelsea and Strasbourg agree 12th deal between clubs this season\n\nHas the January transfer window always felt flat?\n\nUefa has been talking critically about MCOs for some time.\n\nIt its European Club Footballing Landscape report in 2023 it said that the \"growth in multi-club investment has the potential to distort transfer activity\".\n\nThe report added that it has led to transfers at \"prices that suit investors, rather than at fair values, to the detriment of trainer clubs\".\n\nThe Premier League says it has checks and balances in place to make sure all transfer deals are completed to fair market value - either loan or permanent.\n\nThe only time related-party loan deals came up at a Premier League shareholders' meeting was in 2023.\n\nClubs were concerned Newcastle could use their Saudi Arabian links to bring in players on loan at minimal cost.\n\nA vote to outlaw such incoming loans just for the 2024 winter transfer window was narrowly defeated. MCO-style transfer deals have not been discussed since.\n\nMCOs have grown further since the Uefa report. Indeed, it was later that year that BlueCo bought Strasbourg.\n\nYet there is little Uefa can actually do, other than introduce tougher regulations on access to its own competitions.\n\nWhen Manchester United and Nice, and Manchester City and Girona, were admitted to the same European competition in 2024-25, transfers between the clubs were banned for three windows.\n\nLast year Uefa were more strict by bringing forward the deadline for MCO compliance to 1 March. That caught out Palace, but has yet to be tested with one of the bigger clubs like Manchester United or Manchester City.\n\nUefa is expected to try to go further, concerned that MCOs present \"a material threat to the integrity of European club competitions\".\n\nChelsea would argue it is unfair to single them out purely because they are part of an MCO, and that they play by the rules.\n\nIn any case, MCO transfer deals are commonplace. They would say they behave in a similar way to the Red Bull Group, who sold Nicolas Seiwald and Benjamin Sesko from Red Bull Salzburg to RB Leipzig in 2023.\n\nDeals are planned according to strategic needs - good for players and probably good for both clubs.\n\nA player might return to Stamford Bridge ready for first-team football, as was the case with winger Andrey Santos and now Sarr.\n\nOr performances at Strasbourg can see a player's value increase and improve their career chances.\n\nGoalkeeper Djordje Petrovic was sold to Bournemouth for £25m last summer - double the fee paid to New England Revolution in 2023 and it made him a Premier League number one.\n\nStrasbourg have benefitted from Chelsea's scouting network and resources, too.\n\nTake forward Joaquin Panichelli, signed for £14m from Alaves last summer.\n\nThe 23-year-old, who has scored 11 Ligue 1 goals this season, earned his first senior cap for Argentina in November.\n\nPanichelli was reportedly the subject of transfer enquiries at the end of the window, with Strasbourg quoting a price of £43m.\n\nThe association with BlueCo has enabled Strasbourg to not only spend big on players, but also reject offers.\n\nOther clubs in France may argue it is too beneficial for Strasbourg with the resources they have access to.\n\nThe problem for Strasbourg will always be when Chelsea come calling.\n\nStrasbourg can benefit from the loan system and finances but if Chelsea want the next Sarr, Rosenior or Emegha there is nothing anyone can do about it. That is the compromise.\n\nFootball fans may not like it, but it has been going on for years in many different forms.\n\nChelsea and BlueCo are just doing it their own way.\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

The small fields out there throughout the course of the year, their players get full points.\"\n\nThe Spaniard added he believes \"there's work to be done\".\n\n\"While it's good for some people, it could cause some players to actually lose world ranking points instead of gaining them because finishing 11th is basically a missed cut, and we're already adding to the divisor.\n\n\"But I'm thankful that LIV Golf got their foot in the door, and there's a possibility for us to walk in the room and be recognised as a tour, as we should be.\"\n\nSetting out its reasons for the restrictions, OWGR said LIV Golf's eligibility failures included an average field size of 57 for 2026 versus the minimum of 75 set out in the ranking body's regulations and \"self-selection of players with players being recruited rather than earning their place on the tour in many cases\".\n\nLIV has described OWGR's stance as \"unprecedented\", saying someone finishing 11th in one of its events would be \"treated the same as a player finishing 57th\".\n\nThe circuit has also highlighted events such as the Hero World Challenge (20 players), and the PGA Tour's end-of-season play-off events the Tour Championship (30) and BMW Championship (49) - and the European DP World Tour Championship (52) - as having smaller fields and no cut but still receiving world ranking points for all participants.\n\nRahm was among six players, also including England's Tyrell Hatton, tied for fourth after the first round at Riyadh Golf Club on Wednesday.\n\nBelgian Thomas Detry claimed a share of the lead on his LIV debut.\n\nThe 33-year-old, whose most recent win came at the PGA Tour's Phoenix Open last February, shot a bogey-free seven-under-par 65 to tie Peter Uihlein.\n\n\"First day on the job, so a little bit of a change for me, so a bit nervous,\" said Detry, who is part of Dustin Johnson's 4Aces GC.\n\nAustralia's Elvis Smylie, another rookie, is one off the lead, with Rahm and Hatton in a group two back, while Bryson DeChambeau and Sergio Garcia are at four under.\n\nThe event also marks LIV's switch from a 54-hole format to 72.",

    "description": "Matt Pyzdrowski is an academy goalkeeper coach at Malmö FF, so we caught up with him to learn all about new Sunderland goalie Melker Ellborg.",
    "fullText": "Matt, thanks for joining us. You’re a former pro goalkeeper, now coaching the U19 and U17 keepers at Malmö FF academy, plus providing goalkeeping analysis for The Athletic. Melker Ellborg is someone you know inside out from daily training — what’s his story at Malmö, and how did this rapid rise happen in the last 12 months?\n\nMatt Pyzdrowski: His story is just incredible. He’s been part of the first team for the last couple of years, but was loaned out to lower-league clubs, where he didn’t get much playing time — that’s unusual because that’s why you send someone on loan. Malmö’s always believed in him, but the club has really high standards: win the championship every year, get into Europe. It’s hard for a young guy to break in.\n\nThis year, Ricardo Friedrich was No.1 at the start (after Johan Dahlin’s injury — club legend with seven or eight titles). Melker was originally the third choice, but the team struggled, Ricardo didn’t convince, and Melker was performing in training. The club’s hand was forced — they gave him a run. He played seven Allsvenskan games and got five clean sheets. Then Robin Olsen came back, but even he didn’t convince everyone, and fans were saying play the young guy — he’s the future. He also got five games in Europe and did an incredible job. The rise has been meteoric.\n\nGetting European games so quickly shows real trust. What stands out about his mentality?\n\nMatt: It’s a high level for Malmö — they dominate domestically and want to make a name in Europe. When things go wrong, young guys get chances, and Melker took full control. He’s brave, bounces back from mistakes, and is never discouraged, even when experienced guys played ahead.\n\nThe first-team goalkeeper coach always says he’s never complained — just worked harder. He’s humble, reflective, confident, but not cocky. That gives him composure on the field.\n\nOff it, he’s quiet; on it, he’s in control and organised.\n\nWith only about 14 senior games for Malmö (seven league, five Europa League, two cup), did the move surprise you?\n\nMatt: Football moves quickly. Clubs have lists of young players; once he played and performed in quality matches — including Europe — he rose fast. At 22, it’s an incredible experience in a short time. Numbers-wise, it’s crazy — he’s got limited games — but Sunderland sees the potential.\n\nIt’s the most expensive goalkeeper sale from Allsvenskan ever, but for Sunderland, it’s peanuts. It’s smart business: develop him, and he could play in the Premier League or be sold for profit.\n\nStyle-wise? Comparisons to Robin Roefs seem common — aggressive, ball-playing, but commanding...\n\nMatt: Melker said it himself: he’s offensive and aggressive. He takes chances in build-up and crossings, and has modern positioning. He’s good on the ball, comfortable short/medium/long, but can be risky — the critique is that he sometimes tries too much. But he didn’t change after early mistakes; he continued.\n\nI love aggressive guys — they’re easier to reel in than push a timid one. He has explosive athleticism, is powerful, and covers corners brilliantly. It fits the game’s shift: a hybrid of ball-playing and dominating off the line in faster/direct play. Similar to Roefs, Verbruggen, etc.\n\nHow’s it viewed in Sweden/Malmö? And for the academy?\n\nMatt: As a massive success story, it’s a huge move for him to the Premier League.\n\nIt’s win-win: Malmö gets a record fee, and they still have Robin Olsen. It’s seen as positive; he’s now viewed as future national team material. For academy lads (he joined at 16 as our product), it’s inspiring. Malmö produces great keepers, but breaking in is tough. He’s the first young one to get the chance and deliver.\n\nIt shows that if you stick at it and take your opportunity, it can happen.\n\nWhen he arrives at the Academy of Light, what should fans expect? He’s adding competition behind Roefs, replacing Patterson in the group.\n\nMatt: He’ll be motivated to impress — he’s a fighter, and never complains. He’s quiet off-field, but dominant in training: screaming, organising, and making crazy saves. It’s a tough transition to a higher level, but he’ll adapt — he’s done it before. It’s low-risk, but high-reward, and with huge potential.\n\nOver the next 18 months, what would you hope to see?\n\nMatt: Short-term: settle in England, get comfortable with teammates/staff/expectations. Then perform when chances come, in the cups at first more than likely.\n\nThe pressure at Malmö was huge, but he thrived. He’ll rise to the Premier League challenge.\n\nFor fans not quite sure about this one, what would you say?\n\nMatt: I understand short-term doubts, but look 18 months ahead — it could be an afterthought. Watch him train if you can; you’ll be blown away physically and mentally. He’s got the level.\n\n𝗛𝗔𝗪𝗔𝗬 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗣𝗢𝗗𝗖𝗔𝗦𝗧 🎙️\n\nMatt Pyzdrowski is a goalie coach at Malmö FF & writes for The Athletic, so we picked his brains on new Sunderland signing Melker Ellborg!\n\nAPPLE: https://t.co/cXnWinYrxk\nSPOTIFY: https://t.co/um1HNpMxgZhttps://t.co/MrScfojZL0 | #SAFC ❤️🤍 pic.twitter.com/4f6buYtIWe\n\n— Roker Report (@RokerReport) February 2, 2026",

    "description": "Jimmy Thorpe should never be forgotten and at a time when SAFC are getting so much right on the pitch, there is surely something they could do off it to commemorate a man who died playing for his football club.",
    "fullText": "In today’s world of football, many people complain about the protection — or overprotection — that goalkeepers receive from match officials in games yet this wasn’t always the way it was.\n\nAround this time in 1936, Sunderland AFC were riding a crest of a wave in the top tier of English football where they were currently leading the table as they came up against a dogged and intensely physical Chelsea side.\n\nIn the goal for Sunderland that day was Jarrow-born 22-year-old goalkeeper Jimmy Thorpe, a promising youngster considered to one day become among the best in the game. Unfortunately for the young goalkeeper, little did he know that not only would this be his final ever game he played but also one of the final few days of his young life.\n\nIn what was an ill-tempered game, Thorpe had been having a fine game where he made some really decent saves from a Chelsea side littered with stars. In the second half, the game took a turn for the worse where it became rougher, more aggressive and uncontrolled by a referee named Mr H. S. Warr.\n\nChelsea, who were clearly trying to rough up their superior opponents, upped the ante where they were tackling hard. Prior to events in the second half where Chelsea right-half Billy Mitchell was also sent off, the referee had already spoken to them about their devious fouling which was becoming a theme in the game.\n\nUnfortunately, the protests from the referee lacked strength and authority as our young goalkeeper unfortunately paid for with his life. With Sunderland 3-1 up, Chelsea’s forwards ran at the Sunderland goalkeeper again and again in the match. Thorpe had nullified their threat and on one occasion when he dived on the ball, Chelsea players proceeded to repeatedly kick out at Thorpe’s head, neck and upper body for a prolonged length of time until Sunderland players intervened in this assault.\n\nIn those days, players could kick at the ball when the goalkeeper had it in his hands but it seemed clear that it had gone too far in this moment with the referee doing nothing about it. Witnesses to the incident at Roker Park said the goalkeeper was deathly white and shaken after the incident yet he inexplicably carried on playing with Chelsea scoring two goals from mistakes made by the clearly unsteady Thorpe.\n\nSo unsteady was the young goalkeeper that it was also reported that he had to use the goalposts as a crutch for him to stand up straight whilst he was on the pitch. Simply, he should have been escorted off the pitch to be cared for.\n\nAfter the game, Thorpe returned home reportedly feeling fine despite the knocks he had taken. Unfortunately he had then collapsed at his Sunderland home and spent the full weekend bedridden and seriously ill, and by this point had already developed a badly bruised face, swollen eye socket and severe head wound.\n\nThis was all due to the heavy kicks he sustained from the Chelsea forward-line’s rough play. He was admitted to the Monkwearmouth and Southwick Hospital on Monday, 3 February, and eventually, tragically succumbed to his injuries on Wednesday, 5 February aged just twenty-two.\n\nAn inquest ruled he died from diabetes and heart attack accelerated by his injuries, but subsequent inquiries by police and football authorities did not lead to any players facing charges despite the harrowing events that occurred.\n\nReflecting back on this tragic event, it seems inexplicable now that a goalkeeper was allowed to carry on giving the head injuries he had picked up. Additionally, the subsequent inquiry from the FA shockingly actually ruled that Sunderland were guilty of playing a player who they knew was in fact diabetic.\n\nNewspaper articles after the event appeared to downplay the event. One paper labelled Thorpe a ‘coward’ for the mistakes he made whilst another lambasted the goalkeeper stating that ‘Atrocious goalkeeping cost Sunderland a point’ and whilst it is surely the case that they didn’t know the full extent of the issues that Thorpe was facing, it is saddening to think the man didn’t instantly get the help, respect and support that he deserved.\n\nFar from being an aforementioned coward, Thorpe is a hero in this tragedy and is one that deserves more appreciation and focus than he receives. Although he was tipped to become an England international, he was most importantly a young father and husband.\n\nThe events of that day should never have happened and the lack of leadership from the referee up to the FA leave a sour taste in the mouth for anyone who learns more about this harrowing situation.\n\nJimmy Thorpe should never be forgotten and at a time when Sunderland Association Football Club are getting so much right on the pitch, there is surely something they could do off it to commemorate a man who died playing for his football club.\n\nOn the anniversary of his death, we remember Jimmy Thorpe, the husband, the father and the player.",

    "fullText": "I’d have to say that it was another good window for the club, all things considered.\n\nFew transfers seem to run smoothly but it appears as if a lot of hard work has gone on behind the scenes — both in terms of strengthening Règis Le Bris’ options and with regards helping one or others go out and get games elsewhere.\n\nI hope to see a lot of the outgoings advance their careers and do well for themselves, and will always retain fond memories of the ones that were crucial to our rise back up the leagues.\n\nIt was pretty clear that most of them needed to move on, whereas I must admit that I was surprised by the Simon Adingra situation, as it feels as if he had been tracked by the club for some time so I’d assumed they would be keen to give him longer to sake a claim. At least we were decisive and avoided a potentially nasty situation where a well-paid player is just left to rot — by moving quickly and helping fix up a decent move for him, I think everyone benefits.\n\nThe way the Lutsharel Geertruida news was handled felt encouraging too, as it showed a different side to the club.\n\nIt’s great to see our resources being used sensibly and wages freed up where appropriate, and I hope that a lot of the switches made help set us up for another positive summer recruitment drive, but in the meantime there are points to be played for and Sunderland did try to do right by the player but also look after themselves and keep hold of an important figure.\n\nThis apparent professionalism and clarity leads to a better atmosphere around the squad and I daresay was a factor in the three new arrivals deciding to come he also.\n\nTime will tell whether these lads come good, but you can understand at least why they’ve been brought in and be confident that they’ll be given the right environment to try and make a mark. His stats and fee suggest Nilson Angulo will be put into the side fairly swiftly as well, so whilst the future has been taken into account, it isn’t at the cost of the present.\n\nGoing back to Adingra, while his purchase now looks as if it didn’t work out, you could still mark it as a success in comparison to previous ways of doing things.\n\nArthur Masuaku, for example — brought in as cover and longer needed now that Dennis Cirkin is fit — was presumably able to find a suitable destination because he was on a fair contract and not some sort of albatross wage that encouraged him to hang around and rock the boat.\n\nI doubt we’ll ever get to know fully what goes on in terms of transfers — and all sorts of things could’ve fallen through or changed for all we know — but the evidence we do have suggests a continued desire to move forward at pace, but not in a way that costs the club its very existence.\n\nI like what’s been done in January and I reckon things are already being mapped out for subsequent windows…\n\nThe window was maybe slightly quieter than I expected, but definitely not one to complain about.\n\nThe January window has become known for its inflated values and it was no different this year. The club were clear throughout this period that they wouldn’t rush into anything due to these higher prices, but would take their chance if it came — and I think this was a big reason for the focus on outgoings.\n\nWithin these outgoings, there’s a range of emotions but firstly, you have the transfers that are positive.\n\nThe loaning of young lads like Tom Lavery, Trey Ogunsuyi and Ben Middlemas will hopefully prove a good learning curve for them, giving them the brutal first hand experience that lower league English football provides, whereas the sales of players like Adil Aouchiche, Jay Matete and Joe Anderson were slightly different.\n\nIt never really clicked for them on Wearside, so an alternative path was provided. They’ve all shown glimpses of talent and I’m glad that the club was able to find them each a move.\n\nThen you have the ones that sting; players leaving that were crucial in our progress through the leagues.\n\nAnthony Patterson’s loan is good for him as he needs minutes, but it was still tough to see him go. At least he’ll return in the summer, but I can’t say the same for others. Dan Neil and Patrick Roberts were two excellent players for us and without them we wouldn’t be where we are today. Part of me would’ve liked to have seen them given more of a chance, but it wasn’t appropriate.\n\nJocelin Ta Bi appears to be one for the future and is still a few weeks away from being involved in the matchday squad, but Régis Le Bris and the directors clearly see something in him, so I hope we can tap into that.\n\nGoalkeeper Melker Ellborg looks to be a great signing. He was being looked at by many clubs in the summer, so I was glad to see us snap him up. With the successes of Robin Roefs, he might not see too many minutes but he should provide good competition to motivate Roefs to maintain his high standards as well as being able to step in if needed.\n\nNilson Angulo is probably the biggest of the three.\n\nA young, talented player who seems to be the sort to get us fans on the edge of our seats. He’s done really well in Belgium but of course, there’s a skill gap to the Premier League. Noah Sadiki made that step up brilliantly and I hope Angulo can do the same.\n\nSigning Angulo only occurred due to the loaning out of Simon Adingra.\n\nI know it hadn’t really clicked for him since we signed him in the summer, but I wasn’t expecting him to leave. There were definitely signs of potential and his goal against Leeds was terrific, but as the club said, they’ll take the chance when it comes and that’s what they did. Hopefully, Adingra will find his form in France and Angulo will be successful for us.\n\nOverall, I think this window has been really positive.\n\nYes, some of the players leaving is a shame but the club is evolving and that is clear from this transfer window. Hopefully the signings get up to speed as soon as possible and can benefit us for the remainder of the season.\n\nI’m pretty happy with the business done but I do feel we could’ve done a little more in a couple of places. That said, it’s a hard market to work in over January and by the end I was happy with our level of activity.\n\nIn goal, we’ve given Anthony Patterson a chance to play on loan. We’ve also brought in another prospect and we feel pretty solid with Robin Roefs for sure.\n\nIn defence, we’ve also let some underused players go in one way or another — including Leo Hjelde and Arthur Masuaku — but I would’ve liked news about an extension for Dennis Cirkin and hopefully that’ll come soon.\n\nOut wide, we’ve done some great business, bringing in some young and more established experience while cycling out some options which haven’t worked as well as we all hoped, including Simon Adingra. Patrick Roberts also looks happy at Birmingham, so we wish him all the best.\n\nOnly time will tell on the new faces out wide but based on the feedback, we may have some real talent in Nilson Angulo and Jocelin Ta Bi, and we still have others to compete in Chemsdine Talbi (who was excellent at home on Monday), Romaine Mundle and Bertrand Traoré when he’s fit.\n\nThe one place I fancied more reinforcement was central midfield, but with Lutsharel Geertruida’s exit being quashed, hopefully he can cover for Granit Xhaka with Habib Diarra and others helping in various ways.\n\nIf we keep playing as we did against Burnley, the captain coming back when he’s good and ready is fine, but we have no Dan Neil, and some tough fixtures coming up.\n\nIf the right players aren’t out there, we don’t need more baggage, so hopefully we’ll be OK in the next couple of games, get Xhaka back and then really kick on during the final ten to twelve games of the season with a squad which on the whole is more balanced now than it was at Christmas.",

    "description": "“Neil and Patterson delivered Sunderland back to the Premier League, and in doing so helped usher in an era that ultimately moved beyond them”, writes James Hunter.",
    "fullText": "Wembley Stadium, 4:59pm on 24 May 2025, was a seismic moment.\n\nWho can forget Tommy Watson’s 95th-minute winner against Sheffield United in the Championship play-off final?\n\nIt ended Sunderland’s eight-year wait for a long-overdue return to the Premier League and set the stage for the magnificent season Régis Le Bris and his side are currently enjoying.\n\nEight months on, the aftershocks of that day — and the paradigm shift it triggered — continue.\n\nI write, of course, in the wake of the departures of Dan Neil and Anthony Patterson, two of Sunderland’s Wembley heroes and mainstays of that promotion-winning side.\n\nMidfielder Neil started all but two league games last season — one of those absences due to suspension — while goalkeeper Patterson started all but four. Both also started all three play-off games.\n\nBut promotion changes everything. It always does.\n\nAnd with Sunderland stepping up a level, the summer was spent building a squad fit to compete in the top flight — a process that left Neil and Patterson among those squeezed out.\n\nSunderland fans loved seeing homegrown stars Neil and Patterson thrive last season, and they would have been thrilled to watch them test themselves in the Premier League.\n\nInstead, Patterson departed without making a top-flight appearance, linking up on loan with former Sunderland boss Alex Neil at Millwall for the remainder of the season. Dan Neil’s involvement on Wearside, meanwhile, was restricted to three substitute outings totalling just 13 minutes before he joined Ipswich Town on loan to play out the final months of his contract.\n\nSentiment is a fine thing, but there is little room for it in the upper echelons of professional sport.\n\nFor all Patterson’s undoubted ability, Sunderland upgraded last summer with the signing of Robin Roefs, while the arrival of Melker Ellborg earlier this year cleared the path for his departure.\n\nAnd while Neil was one of the first names on the teamsheet in the Championship, the equation changes when players of the calibre of Granit Xhaka, Noah Sadiki and Habib Diarra arrive at the club.\n\nSunderland are moving onwards and upwards, and with that progress comes inevitable change.\n\nNeil and Patterson are simply too good to become perennial substitutes or bit-part Premier League players.\n\nBetter, then, that both have joined clubs competing for play-off places — and perhaps more — at the sharp end of the Championship.\n\nTheir roles in Sunderland’s rise cannot be overstated.\n\nFor Neil, captaining his boyhood club to Wembley glory was the stuff of childhood dreams. And the image of him and fellow Black Cats fan Patterson lifting the play-off trophy together is one that will live long in the memory.\n\nBut Wembley was both a summit and a turning point. Neil and Patterson delivered Sunderland back to the Premier League, and in doing so helped usher in an era that ultimately moved beyond them. That is not failure or rejection, but the price of progress — and one Sunderland can afford to pay because of what they gave.\n\nFollow James Hunter over on X by clicking here!",

    "description": "RR reader Mark was blown away by Chemsdine Talbi’s goal against Burnley — another moment of class from the Moroccan!",
    "fullText": "Monday night…wow! I witnessed the goal of the season.\n\nMy seat is in L6 of the Stadium of Light, right behind from where Chemsdine Talbi struck his wonder goal.\n\nThe moment it left his foot, you knew it was going in — “postage stamp”.\n\nThe best compliment I can give that goal is no goalkeeper in the world would’ve saved it or even laid a glove on it. It was that good.\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi, Mark. Thank you for your letter.\n\nIt was some goal from Talbi against Burnley, wasn’t it?\n\nI loved the confidence he displayed in order to shoot from that distance and that he was able to produce the skill to make it work. A wonderful solo strike and another reminder of the huge talent possessed by the nimble and elusive Moroccan winger.\n\nHopefully there are one or two more of those moments to come before the end of the season!\n\nI can’t understand the upset and anger directed towards the club for allowing the players who did so well in League One and the Championship to move on.\n\nPlayers who’ve been on the long journey through the academy will be remembered with great affection and will always be held in the highest regard by true Sunderland supporters — and I’d also extend that gratitude to others who’ve made important contributions in our slow climb back to the top.\n\nThere are too many to name but every supporter will have their own list of favourites.\n\nI know I have mine and Corry Evans is one, but if these lads can’t get into the team, it’s because the team is better, stronger and more skilful. We’re now a Premier League side with Premier League class-players, and miles better now simply because we have far better players.\n\nWe’re on the first rung of a steep climb to the top so it’s early days but I’ll tell anyone who’ll listen that I look forward to the day when none of the first-team squad playing now are good enough for our team, as if that ever happens, it would mean we really are at the top of the tree.\n\nSo again, thank you to all the lads we’ve let go.\n\nYou’ve all played your part in our slow upward ascent and we’ll always remember how you played your part in our story. Good luck with your careers. I know most will be successful and again, thanks for the memories.\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi, Gerald. Thank you for getting in touch.\n\nIn my view, the departures of local lads such as Anthony Patterson and Dan Neil was a great example of the need to balance ruthlessness with opportunity, and these are the tough decisions that’ll have to be made in order to ensure this club continues to progress over the coming seasons.\n\nAs a fan of both players — as well as Patrick Roberts, who’s moved to Birmingham City — it did feel like the end of a chapter but on the other hand, they’re going to be playing regular football and at this stage of their career, that’s absolutely vital.\n\nFootball can be a tough sport and we’ve seen that in the past week, but hopefully these decisions will be vindicated in time.\n\nAs sad as it was to see Dan Neil depart the club, we have to be brutally honest as to why the decision was made.\n\nI take nothing whatsoever away from the great service he gave to the club or how much Sunderland meant to him, but we do have to look at how things are in the real football world and the truth is that the lad would go “missing” too many times during games — and Jobe Bellingham was the same.\n\nWe could all see the potential in both these players but in the Premier League, potential alone is just not enough.\n\nI remember watching Neil and I used to scream as he was just ineffective at times and seemed to be going through the motions. Don’t get me wrong: when he was on song, he was excellent, but being excellent at Championship level on occasion doesn’t equate to being established in the Premier League.\n\nOn saying that, I would love the lad to step up a gear.\n\nYou never know — being away at a new setup might just bring out that extra 10% that’s needed from him and he might yet come back to us all guns blazing. I genuinely do hope so, as it’s extremely rare these days to have a player who’s willing to stay with the one club for his entire career.\n\nSo, good luck Dan. Please prove people such as me wrong, and I’ll be pleased to gorge on huge dollops of humble pie.\n\nEd’s Note [Phil]: Hi, Peter. Thank you for your letter.\n\nI’ve heard this argument a lot when it comes to the Sunderland careers of Dan Neil and Jobe, and I have to respectfully disagree wholeheartedly.\n\nThe idea that Neil would “go missing” in games never stacked up to me. Fundamentally, I’ve always believed that to a point, it’s not actually a bad thing when midfielders simply get on with their jobs, give their all and keep things ticking over. Neil did that on so many occasions — and often in a position that was unnatural to him, as we saw during the 2024/2025 season.\n\nTime will tell how his career pans out from here but Ipswich have signed a very, very capable Championship midfielder and if they’re to win promotion at the end of the season, I wouldn’t be surprised if Neil plays a major role along the way.",

    "fullText": "The Vancouver Canucks will officially enter the 2026 Winter Olympic break after a 5–2 loss to the Vegas Golden Knights. Two defencemen found the scoresheet for Vancouver, with Elias Pettersson and Pierre-Olivier Joseph scoring the Canucks’ lone two goals of the game. Kevin Lankinen made his second consecutive start, stopping 26 of 31 shots faced and will now head to Italy to represent Finland at the Olympics.\n\nDespite not being the most eventful, the start of this game didn’t go poorly for the Canucks. They managed to limit Vegas to seven shots on goal while also killing a penalty. While Lankinen did end up having to make a couple of big stops, for the most part, Vancouver did their due diligence to keep high-danger chances away from their goaltender.\n\nVancouver’s power play has been a talking point as of late as well, as prior to tonight, they’d only scored once in their last nine games. As a change-up, the Canucks switched their first-unit up by subbing Garland in for Jonathan Lekkerimäki. They were unable to convert on their lone power play awarded in the first period, generating only two scoring chances.\n\nTonight was a big game for defenceman Elias Pettersson, who faced his fair share of challenges in the first period after being crunched into the boards by Vegas forward Keegan Kolesar. In the second period, it was the young Pettersson who gave the Canucks a bit of life by joining the rush and scoring after Vancouver quickly allowed two goals.\n\nLast game, the line of Liam Öhgren, Teddy Blueger, and Conor Garland played well for the Canucks. This trio repeated their efforts tonight, generating some jump early on in a scoreless first period while also generating a fair amount of chances for the Canucks. Vancouver’s first goal of the game came as a direct result of this line’s drive into the O-zone, with Blueger’s retrieval along the boards factoring into Öhgren’s rush feed to Pettersson. This line’s efforts didn’t stop there, however, as more O-zone pressure from the trio gave Joseph the space to shoot the puck on Akira Schmid, giving the defenceman his first goal as a Canuck after being denied earlier in the game.\n\nDespite being able to cut their deficit to one, Vancouver suffered a brief collapse at the start of the third period that allowed Vegas to widen the gap to three within the span of a minute. Pavel Dorofeyev was left all alone at Lankinen’s back-door on the Golden Knights’ first goal of the third period, while Alexander Holtz capitalized on an open opportunity in the slot to make it 5–2 for Vegas. From there, the Canucks were unable to generate enough quality chances to cut the lead, putting only four shots on goal during the final period.\n\n\"You've gotta experience it,\" Canucks Head Coach Adam Foote said post-game of what can be worked on regarding not letting quick goals-against impact the team. \"We're a young team [...] we're going to see blips of it here and there. We need everyone on board and when we're playing our best hockey, everyone is, we had blips of it today, but we just have a tiny breakdown there, a couple mistakes on a couple of goals, leave the slot open just on bad reads, and that'll continue to be worked on, and it is what it is. It's a young group. This level of a team, that experience, they're going to take advantage of that in these situations.\"\n\nThe Canucks will officially enter the 2026 Olympic break with a record of 18–33–6, cementing themselves safely in 32nd in the NHL throughout the bulk of February. When they return, they could end up regaining quite a few bodies in the lineup, as Marco Rossi, Brock Boeser, Filip Chytil, Nils Höglander, and Zeev Buium are all currently out.\n\nCanucks enter the 2026 Olympic break with a record of 18–33–6\n\nVancouver has scored only power play goal in their last 10 games\n\nTeddy Blueger is now up to four goals and three assists in eight games since returning from injury\n\n5:09 - VGK: Jack Eichel (20) from Rasmus Andersson and Mark Stone\n\n6:34 - VGK: Cole Reinhardt (3) from Braeden Bowman and Shea Theodore\n\n7:11 - VAN: Elias Pettersson (D) (2) from Liam Öhgren and Teddy Blueger\n\n7:39 - VGK: Ivan Barbashev (16) from Mark Stone and Jack Eichel\n\n19:51 - VAN: Pierre-Olivier Joseph (1) from Conor Garland and Teddy Blueger\n\n2:33 - VGK: Pavel Dorofeyev (25) from Mitch Marner and Reilly Smith\n\n3:31 - VGK: Alexander Holtz (3) from Keegan Kolesar and Jeremy Lauzon\n\nWith tonight’s loss, the Canucks are now on break as the 2026 Winter Olympics begin. Elias Pettersson (Sweden), Kevin Lankinen (Finland), Teddy Blueger (Latvia), Anri Ravinskis (Latvia), Filip Hronek (Czechia), David Kämpf (Czechia), and Lukas Reichel (Germany) will now head to Italy to represent their respective countries.

    "description": "The Texas Longhorns evened up their SEC record at 5-5 with a win over South Carolina but their slow starts are still a problem area that Sean Miller must fix.",
    "fullText": "The 2025-26 Texas men's basketball team will never make it look easy.\n\nMost every game is a scrap, opponent's record be damned.\n\nAnd so it went Tuesday against South Carolina at sleepy Moody Center.\n\nThe Longhorns are smart enough to realize they can’t look past anybody, yet they were locked in the middle of a cockfight at crunch time against a team with nothing to lose. SC, now 2-8 in SEC play, isn’t a good team but a visitor from another planet would not have been able to pick which team was favored by 13 points at certain points.\n\nMORE CED: Why Texas baseball's Schlossnagle sought roster depth in the offseason\n\nThe 84-75 win had to happen at this point in the season lest the Horns were about to start wondering if they would accept the predictable NIT invitation in a couple of months.\n\n  It's called Ced’s Corner, from the mind of the American-Statesman’s resident sports columnist, the 2025 NSMA Texas Sportswriter of the Year.\n\nAs it turns out, they shook off a comatose start in front of a late-arriving crowd for the early tipoff — the student section at Moody was noticeably thin — survived 35 points from South Carolina guard Meechie Johnson and blistered the Gamecocks with 49 second-half points to win a game much closer than the final score indicated.\n\nAnd all of a sudden, the Horns, after an 0-2 start in conference play, are firmly in the NCAA Tournament mix. They’re 13-9 overall and 5-5 in the league which puts them only one win from matching last season’s conference total, though it’s obvious the SEC isn’t as strong as the 2025 group that sent 14 teams to the NCAAs.\n\nWith beatable Ole Miss coming to town Saturday and Chris Beard coming off an 84-66 beatdown courtesy of fellow former Longhorn coach Rick Barnes’ Tennessee team, there is a chance to stack a third straight win.\n\nThe Horns avoided a fate similar to what happened to the football team after it lost to a bad Florida team, effectively crippling its chances to make the College Football Playoff. In basketball’s case, they figured it out thanks to a couple of second-half 3-pointers from Cam Heide, who has emerged as a needed source of offense of late; 15 second-half points from veteran guard Tramon Mark and another 20 from All-SEC candidate Dailyn Swain.\n\nWith football coach Steve Sarkisian and baseball coach Jim Schlossnagle seated together courtside, the Horns pulled it together in front of 10,286 who rose to their feet, some of them for the first time all evening.\n\nMORE HORNS: Texas athletics lost money in 2025\n\nOne question can apply to both the fans and the team they were watching. Where was the energy?\n\nWe understand that a 6 p.m. start and Austin traffic aren’t made for one another but the fans who were there for the tip didn’t bring a whole lot of energy to a team that has a recent history of slow starts. The Horns missed seven of their first eight shots and didn’t reach double digits until the 11-minute, 14-second mark of the first half.\n\n“The message is to keep being aggressive,” Heide said. “You’ve got to go in there and set the tone. If we do that, it’s really going to help.”\n\nMORE CED: Where Texas football landed on the Ceddy Awards\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, the crowd will help too.\n\nAt one point of the second half with the game still in the balance, coach Sean Miller raised his arms to the fans, asking them to give his team some energy. If we’re being honest, the crowd was as lethargic as the guys playing even if the result turned out in Texas’ favor.\n\n“The one thing about the crowd is you have to give them something to cheer about,” Miller said. “It’s not one-sided. They're coming here. They're sacrificing. They're coming to watch Texas. They want us to win. They want to see a great game. And you’ve got to be locked in.”\n\nTexas players, coming off a big win at Oklahoma, weren't locked in for large parts of the game, particularly point guard Jordan Pope who suffered through a 26-minute nightmare.\n\nOne of the most experienced guards in the college game missed five of his six field goal attempts and finished with no assists. He went without a field goal for the first 34-plus minutes. When asked if he would consider moving Pope to the wing, Miller said “I think we’ve got him at the right spot. He told me he was a point guard.”\n\nIt’s an understatement to say Texas plays to the competition because the Horns are good enough to give a good team like Auburn a tussle and shaky enough to be locked in a 50-50 wrestling match with the No. 15 team in the 16-team SEC.\n\nThey’re never going to be a shutdown defense as evidenced by the No. 96 defensive ranking per kenpom.com will attest. More important was a move up to No. 33 in Ken's NCAA NET ratings, seventh among SEC teams.\n\nSeven-foot sophomore post Matas Vokietaitis is going through some growing pains on both ends. He continues to commit careless fouls on defense and continues to get stripped by smaller players because he brings the ball down in traffic despite being only three feet from the bucket. He is second on the team with 53 turnovers, a huge number for the position. Worse yet, he missed more point-blank looks than his coaches care to count.\n\nLooking ahead, the Horns are in play to make a realistic run at the Big Dance but they can’t afford to give away winnable games. Ole Miss, at 11-11 overall and 3-6 in the SEC, represents a nice chance to move over .500 after 11 games for the first time since Rodney Terry took over the 2023 team after Beard’s firing. Texas started 8-3 and advanced to the Elite Eight with a win over Miller’s Xavier team that season.\n\nLots has changed since then and if you ask Miller, more change is needed — particularly on defense.\n\nIf anything, they’re in a good place considering where they started.",

    "fullText": "SAN ANGELO, Texas (Concho Valley Homepage) — The Angelo State Rams welcomed their newest members of the 2026 roster on Wednesday, Feb 4.\n\nIt may only be February, but it’s never too early to look ahead to fall and the 2026 football season. The Angelo State Rams introduced their latest offseason acquisitions Wednesday night in front of an audience of coaches, families and friends at Shenanigan’s Sports Bar in San Angelo. Rams head football coach Jeff Girsch spoke at the gathering, introducing each incoming high school signee by projecting their highlights via Hudl.\n\nThe Rams added 22 high school signees as well as five college transfers. Girsch couldn’t be more excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.\n\n“We know they’re going to be good football players [just by] watching their film and seeing that, so that evaluation is pretty easy,” Girsch said. “But getting to know these guys over time and recruiting them [excites us]. We started recruiting some of them back in the summer, and all the way getting through the season and the visit season.”\n\nGirsch isn’t the only coach excited about this incoming class. The Rams’ new offensive coordinator, Jason Johnson, is ready to embrace his new opportunity and is thrilled to work with athletes showing vast versatility.\n\n“I’m really excited about the athleticism because they bring so much versatility to what we do from that standpoint,” Johnson said. “We can use [the players] in different places, not just on offense and defense, but also in our special teams units.”",

He's shot a career-high 40.7% from three in his limited action.\n\nThe move opens a roster spot for guard Tyus Jones, who the Hornets acquired from the Orlando Magic on Wednesday.\n\nMore:Former Hornets center could be on the move from Phoenix\n\nConnaughton was on a $9.4 million contract, which expires if he's not claimed by another team within two days.\n\nIt's been another busy trade deadline for Hornets General Manager Jeff Peterson. Charlotte also acquired Coby White from the Chicago Bulls for Collin Sexton and sent Mason Plumlee to the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nThe moves give the Hornets more depth in the backcourt behind star guards LaMelo Ball and Kon Knueppel. Veteran guard Tre Mann is also on the roster but has seen a diminished role this season.\n\nThis was Connaughton's first season in Charlotte after being acquired from the Milwaukee Bucks last July. The Hornets sent Vasilije Micic to Milwaukee for Connaughton and two second-round picks.\n\nHe's best known for his seven-year run with the Bucks, where he won an NBA Championship in 2021. He was a steady contributor in Milwaukee, playing 20+ minutes per game in five seasons.\n\nConnaughton, an 11-year NBA veteran, could be a solid depth addition for a contending team. He's shot over 37% from three in four seasons and has plenty of playoff experience.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Peterson and Charlotte will make more moves ahead of Thursday's deadline. Center could be a position to monitor, as the Hornets only have two centers on standard contracts.\n\nTracking every deal from 2026 NBA trade deadline\n\nDraymond Green takes another swipe at Dillon Brooks\n\nJared McCain trade allows 76ers to make several key roster moves\n\nDerrick Jones Jr., Isaac Okoro among Lakers trade targets\n\nClippers reportedly declined Celtics offer for Ivica Zubac",

    "fullText": "The Senior Bowl was last week, and the Arizona Cardinals now have a new head coach. We can now begin to firmly look ahead toward the NFL draft.\n\nNFL.com's Bucky Brooks released a new mock draft of the first round.\n\nThe Cardinals have the third overall pick, and he has them going with an offensive lineman.\n\nThe Cardinals must determine if Kyler Murray remains the franchise quarterback. If his time in the desert is indeed done, as many have speculated, the lack of QB depth in the 2026 draft class could prompt the team to look elsewhere for help at the game's most important position. In this case, Arizona adds a foundational piece to its struggling offensive line, which contributed to a 38.7% pressure allowed rate -- the fourth-highest mark in the league in 2025, per Next Gen Stats.\n\nThis pick makes sense. The Cardinals need to figure out the quarterback situation, but they won't likely be selecting one in the first round. They have questions at as many as four starting spots on the offensive line, so landing Fano to lock down right tackle would be a great plan to pair with Paris Johnson.\n\nHowever, while the pick makes sense, it would mean breaking from a three-year trend. The Cardinals have only selected players from the SEC and Big Ten in the first and second rounds in three years with Monti Ossenfort as general manager.\n\nKnowing that, someone like linebacker Arvell Reese out of Ohio State makes sense, but he goes second overall in these projections.\n\nOssenfort obviously could break from his tradition, but it will be something to watch as we approach the draft in the mweeks to come.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "description": "Injury-hit Ireland face the unenviable task of trying to stop returning captain Antoine Dupont and France in Thursday's Six Nations opener in Paris.",
    "fullText": "Venue: Stade de France, Paris Date: Thursday, 5 February Kick-off: 20:10 GMT\n\nCoverage: Listen live on BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Sounds & Radio Ulster; text commentary and highlights on BBC Sport website and app; watch on ITV1\n\nOn the eve of the Six Nations, Ireland captain Caelan Doris used an amusing analogy to describe the world's best player and highlight one of the myriad of challenges facing his side in Thursday's Stade de France tournament opener.\n\nAsked about returning France captain Antoine Dupont, Doris described the famously elusive scrum-half as \"one of those little fish you try to touch and they dart away from you\".\n\n\"He's done me several times,\" admitted Doris.\n\n\"I can think of one particular instance in 2023 where I feel I have him coming up one side of the breakdown and then he twirls and goes around me and beats three defenders on the other side.\"\n\nDoris and Ireland can only hope that Dupont, back from a spell on the sidelines caused by a collision with Irish players last year, isn't so slippery on Thursday.\n\nThe Toulouse star is the heartbeat of a French attack that could dent Ireland's title hopes again.\n\nIn Dublin last year, not even Dupont's withdrawal after 30 minutes could stop a rampant French side from ripping Ireland to shreds with 34 unanswered second-half points.\n\nIt was a haunting afternoon for those in green, and even though Doris carefully sidestepped a question about seeking \"revenge\", Ireland's pre-tournament headaches would make victory in Paris one of the more unlikely achievements under head coach Andy Farrell.\n\nHow France are shaping up for Six Nations defence\n\nStockdale 'back to what he's good at' - Farrell\n\nWhat impact might 'unprecedented' Six Nations schedule have?\n\nTo avenge last year's mauling, Ireland must move past preparations that were hit by injury and disciplinary issues and summon the type of mettlesome, high-intensity display that led them to victory over South Africa in this stadium at the World Cup.\n\nAnd given that France scored a record 30 Six Nations tries last year, Farrell's side will be required to apply scoreboard pressure from the outset.\n\nTo help, Farrell has turned to Jacob Stockdale, who aims to recapture the headline-hogging form of 2018 when his record-breaking seven-try haul earned him the player of the tournament award in Ireland's Grand Slam campaign.\n\nWhile he has predominantly played full-back for Ulster this season, Stockdale has edged out James Lowe to start on the left wing in what will be his first Six Nations appearance since 2021.\n\nStockdale coming up against rapid Bordeaux wing Louis Bielle-Biarrey - the man who broke his try-scoring record last year - will be an intriguing sub-plot and a severe examination of the Ireland player's defence.\n\nOn the try-scoring front, Ireland could do with Dan Sheehan carrying his 2025 form into the French capital and a big effort from their bench.\n\nLeinster hooker Sheehan scored five times in last year's tournament and was also on target in Ireland's victory over France in Marseille in 2024, while replacement back row Jack Conan will hope to emulate last year's tries against Scotland and France after being introduced.\n\nAs ever in the Test arena, there will be much focus on the two fly-halves.\n\nFor Ireland, Sam Prendergast will again start the Six Nations at 10 after beginning last year's campaign with the shirt.\n\nA slick operator with ball in hand, Prendergast has the passing and vision to open up the French defence, but his own defensive frailties have been under the microscope it seems since France's Paul Boudehent ran through his attempted tackle last year.\n\nBut the 22-year-old received the backing of his captain after fending off competition from Jack Crowley and Harry Byrne.\n\n\"Obviously, his defence has caught quite a bit of flak,\" said Doris.\n\n\"But it's an area that...I'm in the same club as him in Leinster and I see day-to-day the work he puts in. Same here in camp.\n\n\"So that side of his game is improving. In terms of his attack, the ceiling is so high for him.\"\n\nFrance's fly-half Matthieu Jalibert is older, has more Test caps and has been in sensational form for Bordeaux this season.\n\nBut he, too, is under pressure after being dropped by Les Bleus boss Fabien Galthie following last year's loss to England.\n\n\"Everyone believes in Matthieu - his team-mates, the coaching staff, and even you lot given that all the journalists were clamouring for him to start the Six Nations given the season he's having,\" said Dupont.\n\n\"It's green lights all the way for him. We know the quality that he is capable of and we hope that he brings all of his potential, in the same way that he has since the beginning of the season.\"\n\nThree months on from an evisceration at the hands of the Springbok scrum, a patched-up Irish pack will be tasked with keeping the Parisian crowd quiet.\n\nOn paper, it is a huge ask. Farrell is without starting Test Lions props Andrew Porter and Tadhg Furlong, while Paddy McCarthy and Jack Boyle's unavailability further weakens his hand at loose-head.\n\nIt means a first Six Nations start for 30-year-old Jeremy Loughman, who is a solid scrummager and has plenty of minutes under his belt for Munster this season. His club-mate Michael Milne - whose two caps came against Georgia and Portugal - provides loose-head cover.\n\nFarrell also hopes tight-head Thomas Clarkson's exposure to the Lions last summer will help guide the 25-year-old through the biggest game of his career.\n\nOf course, the French front row is also missing a familiar face, with Uini Atonio forced into retirement because of a heart problem. The 35-year-old prop had started 18 of France's past 20 Six Nations games, but in Dorian Aldegheri, Galthie has a reasonably experienced replacement.\n\nIn addition to Atonio, France are without Gregory Alldritt and Gael Fickou - who both captained the squad in Dupont's absence - and record try-scorer Damian Penaud, all of whom have been axed by Galthie, while Thibaud Flament is missing for personal reasons.\n\nSuch a radical shake-up points to French eyes on the future, with the returning Dupont the only member of Thursday's matchday squad possessing more than 50 caps.\n\nAnd if Dupont can swim rings around Doris and co again on Thursday, Ireland will struggle to stop France from laying down an early marker.\n\nFrance: Ramos; Attissogbe, Depoortere, Moefana, Bielle-Biarrey; Jalibert, Dupont (capt); Gros, Marchand, Aldegheri, Ollivon, Guillard, Cros, Jegou, Jelonch.\n\nReplacements: Mauvaka, Neti, Montagne, Auradou, Meafou, Nouchi, Serin, Gourgues.\n\nIreland: Osborne; O'Brien, Ringrose, McCloskey, Stockdale; S Prendergast, Gibson-Park; Loughman, Sheehan, Clarkson, McCarthy, Beirne, C Prendergast, Van der Flier, Doris (capt).\n\nReplacements: Kelleher, Milne, Bealham, Ryan, Conan, Timoney, Casey, Crowley.\n\nThe Ireland Rugby Social - can this Ireland team beat France?",

    "fullText": "It’s that time of year in the NBA when goodbyes echo around the league, with teammates forced to bid farewell to some of the most influential figures in the locker room. For Anthony Edwards in 2025, it meant saying goodbye to Mike Conley Jr., a veteran who had been instrumental in the Minnesota Timberwolves’ recent rise in the league.\n\nConley had a rollercoaster 24 hours. He was first traded to the Chicago Bulls, who just one day later, sent him to the Charlotte Hornets. But that may not be the end of this trade-deadline adventure, as there’s a chance he may have to pack his bags again.\n\nEdwards, after the Timberwolves’ victory over the Toronto Raptors earlier today, admitted to hearing that the organization can try to get him back. As a result, he decided to do his part.\n\nConley joined the Wolvesin 2023 and quickly became one of the leaders in the locker room as they made two trips to the Conference Finals. In particular, helped Edwards a lot when he was struggling.\n\n“Mike man, he’s an OG. Always helped me when I was struggling on court. Great conversations off the court, great dude overall,” Edwards said.\n\nThe trade deadline day can be brutal. Players who have been comfortable in a city for years may be forced to move to the other side of the country and turn their lives upside down in a matter of hours. For Conley, he’s already traveled from Minneapolis to Chicago and on to Charlotte.\n\nSo, due to the Andrew Bogut rule, given that he’s been traded twice in the span of 24 hours, he can now return to the original team that he left. Seem as though Edwards keeps hoping that he flies right back home.\n\n“I keep hearing he can come back, so hopefully he will, and I hope he sees this,” Edwards said. “We want you back, Mike. He knows we miss him.”\n\nThe Timberwolves organization would ideally love to bring someone of Conley’s stature back. He wasn’t playing much in 25/26, but had an invaluable veteran presence. And if Edwards, arguably the cornerstone of Minnesota, asks the front office to try to make a move for him again, they would at least give it a try.\n\nThe post “We Want You Back”: Anthony Edwards Sends Heartfelt Message to “OG” Mike Conley appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Valdez is a two-time All-Star and 2022 World Series champion. He was Houston’s ace last season with a 13-11 record and 3.66 ERA.",
    "fullText": "Free agent pitcher Framber Valdez and the Detroit Tigers have agreed to a $115 million, three-year contract, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Wednesday night.\n\nThe person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the deal had not been announced.\n\nValdez became one of baseball’s most durable starters with the Houston Astros. Now, the left-hander is set to join a Tigers rotation anchored by two-time AL Cy Young Award winner Tarik Skubal.\n\nSkubal went to a record-setting salary arbitration hearing Wednesday, with the left-hander asking for $32 million and the Tigers offering $19 million.\n\nValdez is a two-time All-Star and 2022 World Series champion. He was Houston’s ace last season with a 13-11 record and 3.66 ERA, and became a free agent for the first time.\n\nHe struck out 187 and walked 68 in 192 innings, and had a major league-high 12 wild pitches while making $18 million on a deal reached last offseason that avoided salary arbitration. He started Houston’s last four season openers.\n\nSince making his major league debut in 2018 with the Astros, he is 81-52 with a 3.36 ERA. The 32-year-old Dominican averaged more than 191 innings the past four seasons, joining Giants right-hander Logan Webb as the only two pitchers to throw at least 175 innings each of those years.\n\nValdez was 15-7 with a 2.91 ERA over 28 games in 2024 and threw a no-hitter in 2023, when he was an All-Star for a second straight season. He is 8-4 with a 4.34 ERA in 17 postseason games, including 16 starts.\n\nValdez pitched in two World Series for the Astros, and was the winning pitcher in the clinching Game 6 that secured their 2022 championship against Philadelphia.\n\nIn the 2022 Series, he was 2-0 in two starts while allowing two runs over 12 1/3 innings (1.46 ERA) with 18 strikeouts. A year earlier, he gave up 10 runs and 12 hits over 4 2/3 innings (19.29 ERA) in two starts against Atlanta.\n\nValdez rejected a $22,025,000 qualifying offer from the Astros in November, so they would receive a compensatory pick after the fourth round of the 2026 amateur draft if he completes his deal with Detroit, which would forfeit its third-highest selection.\n\nValdez pitched a no-hitter against Cleveland on Aug. 1, 2023. He came close to another one just more than a year later against Texas, but that bid was broken up when Corey Seager homered with two outs in the ninth inning.\n\nThere was a strange moment last season when Valdez denied intentionally hitting his catcher in the chest with a pitch almost immediately after giving up a grand slam in a loss to the New York Yankees.\n\nTwo pitches after Trent Grisham’s slam in the Yankees’ 7-1 victory on Sept. 2, Valdez crossed up catcher César Salazar by throwing a 92.8 mph sinker to Anthony Volpe. Salazar moved his glove downward as the pitch approached the plate, an indication he was expecting a pitch with less velocity and more break. The ball hit him in his chest protector.\n\nJust before the pitch Grisham sent over the fence, Salazar had motioned for Valdez to step off the mound. Valdez and Salazar both said after the game the pitch that hit the catcher wasn’t on purpose.\n\nAstros manager Joe Espada insisted a day later the situation was “100%” resolved in his mind, and he wanted to “get past this and get back to baseball,” and he met with both players.",

    "description": "Among other things, Hofstra wrestler Will Conlon also likes to read and lists “Catcher in the Rye” as his favorite book.  Conlon doesn’t compare himself to the 16-year-old main character, created in the 1951 classic novel by J.D.

    "fullText": "Among other things, Hofstra wrestler Will Conlon also likes to read and lists “Catcher in the Rye” as his favorite book.\n\n“I read that for my 12th-grade AP literature class,” said the 197-pound redshirt college sophomore from Hoover, Ala.\n\nConlon doesn’t compare himself to the 16-year-old main character, created in the 1951 classic novel by J.D. Salinger, who dealt with the reality of adulthood in a much grimier era in New York City.\n\nAnd of course, Hofstra is located 30 miles from the City on Long Island, where wrestlers can find a beach on the Atlantic Ocean as fast as they can find a much busier life in New York City.\n\n“It’s actually more of a suburban area and what I’m used to,” said Conlon, who grew up outside of Birmingham, and does find time to enjoy today’s New York City. “My coach probably doesn’t want me to say this, but there are times I go to the City to eat and eat too much.”\n\nBut Conlon, a 2023 Alabama state high school champion, does believe “100 percent” that the book’s message is helping him adapt to NCAA Division I wrestling.\n\n“(The book) had a big impact on me,” he said. “I’m due to go back through that book because there are many lessons to have been learned from it.”\n\nConlon simply calls his college wrestling career “challenging.” That included a true freshman season in 2023-24 when he went 9-15 at 184 pounds and a redshirt year last season that saw him beat two eventual national qualifiers before undergoing surgery in March to repair an ACL injury.\n\nHe returned this season much healthier and has compiled a 14-9 record through Feb. 1. Though he is not ranked, Conlon considers himself and other Hofstra teammates — like fellow redshirt sophomore Jake Slotnick, 16-11 at 165 pounds — as diamonds in the rough.\n\n“In high school and middle school when I started wrestling, I’ve felt like I’ve been looked over at times,” said Conlon, who also won an NHSCA national championship before coming to Hofstra.\n\n“For me, it’s about chipping away against the top guys in my weight class and trying to close the gap. Consistency is what’s going to get me there. The biggest aspect of my training since high school is where I’ve made myself consistent with training and doing what it takes to get better.\n\n“I’m really thankful for the coaching staff that I have now and who took a chance on me.”\n\nHofstra coach Jamie Franco, the former Pride alum who was a three-time NCAA qualifier (2012-14), believes Hofstra can return to the days when the EIWA school finished as high as seventh in the nation in 2007, but has not had an All-American since 2018 when heavyweight Michael Hughes finished sixth.\n\n“We are a young team,” said Franco, now in his second year. “We just need some experience. Fortunately, most of this team has one or two years of eligibility left.”\n\nFranco — who was introduced to the Alabama native from Conlon’s club coach, Shad Rissler, also a New York native and former prep teammate of Franco —believes that Conlon can be one of his team’s leaders.\n\n“I think he’s a better version of himself and we see each week he’s getting a little stronger,” said Franco. “We hope over the next month before the conference tournament that he keeps building and realizes how well he is doing.”\n\nWill, the son of Carol and Joshua (a former high school wrestler) Conlon, has tried to share his challenge with friends and family back home in Alabama.\n\n“I tell them what’s going on, but if I wasn’t myself, I don’t think I’d truly understand what this has been all about,” he admitted. “It’s a different beast. You have to wake up early, go to workouts and team practices and classes and then go through the competition aspect of it. Every time you compete, a guy is looking to rip your head off, and you have to be willing to do the same thing.”\n\nConlon also credits the Hofstra brotherhood in helping me adapt to his college environment and wrestling goals.\n\n“I just moved off campus this past semester into a house with six other guys and teammates. I consider all those guys my brothers,” he said. “That’s what was important for me when I came here on my visit. I felt like I was home with my family. The summer before my freshman year, I came into training with a team and felt connected with that group.”\n\nBut Conlon also believes he must take his own responsibility to reach his wrestling goals.\n\n“There is something I learned since being in college: you have to seek out the answers to what your development is going to look like and how you are going to get to the next level,” he said. “At this level, you can’t just come in and work on your two best shots of two best re-attacks, work on top and bottom and simply achieve what you want to achieve.\n\n“I feel like you have to be a fan of the sport and be watching the guys who are constantly innovating in the sport and adopting some of those habits and training methods of the best wrestlers. I think some guys don’t realize they also have to be innovators and be as much of a spectator as a competitor.”\n\nA management major, who has been on Hofstra’s Dean List in the past two years, does believe he is reaching his overall life’s goals the past three years.\n\n“Before wrestling was in the cards, which happened late in my high school career, I was thinking about going to a state school near me like Auburn or Alabama,” he said. “And while that experience might have been good, I think taking a different step and direction to wrestle in college and in a completely unknown area, it’s definitely something that aligns with my goals, which is trying out next experiences that make up my life.”",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAlthough the Golden State Warriors’ trade for Kristaps Porzingis and the Washington Wizards’ trade for Anthony Davis (both completed on Wednesday night) will be the main topic of discussion heading into the final stretch of the trade season, it’s worth noting that the New York Knicks recently executed a deal of their own.\n\nThe 2024 Eastern Conference participants cut ties with Jalen Brunson's struggling 6-foot-7 forward via a trade to the Chicago Bulls after less than a full season.\n\n“The New York Knicks are trading Guerschon Yabusele to the Chicago Bulls for Dalen Terry,” ESPN’s Shams Charania reported early Thursday morning.\n\nYabusele has been one of the Knicks’ most disappointing contributors this season, regardless of position. Following an inspiring 2024-25 campaign with the Philadelphia 76ers in 2024-25 (he averaged 11.0 points and 5.6 rebounds per game, while shooting 50.1% from the field and 38.0% from deep), the Knicks felt comfortable taking a chance on him in free agency.\n\nIt’s clear now that New York’s decision backfired, as the former first-round pick was virtually unplayable for first-year head coach Mike Brown this year. Yabusele contributed only 2.7 points and 2.1 rebounds per game with the Knicks, connecting on 39.3% of his field goals and 29.4% from three-point land.\n\nTerry isn’t a high-level bench contributor, either, but it’s challenging to envision him being worse than Yabusele in New York.\n\nMore NBA: Warriors cut ties with Stephen Curry's 6-foot-9 fan-favorite teammate via trade to Raptors",

    "fullText": "This week, I had the chance to speak with longtime Notre Dame athletic trainer Mike Bean about a problem he spent decades watching athletes struggle through—and the solution he eventually built himself.\n\nAfter 36 years with Notre Dame student-athletes across baseball, men’s and women’s soccer, hockey, tennis and for the last 30 years football, Bean had seen just about every version of an ankle injury imaginable. He’d also seen the limitations of how those injuries were treated.\n\n“Ankle injuries and ankle recovery have always been a major obstacle for athletes,” Bean said. “We had options to protect the ankle from spraining, or treat it after a sprain—but I always felt there had to be a better way than what we were doing.”\n\nThat belief stayed with him throughout his career.\n\nBean’s path to Notre Dame began after completing his master’s degree in sports medicine at Western Michigan University, followed by a 10-month internship with Notre Dame’s sports medicine staff. That internship turned into a full-time role—and eventually a 36-year tenure on the Irish sidelines.\n\nDuring that time, ankle injuries remained one of the most persistent challenges he faced.\n\n“Low ankle sprains are one thing, but high ankle sprains are much more problematic,” he explained. “If they’re severe enough, they can even require surgery.”\n\nTraditional treatment options presented their own issues. Braces were worn directly on the ankle, forcing athletes to squeeze both foot and brace into a shoe that was never designed to accommodate both.\n\n“That compromises the integrity of the shoe,” Bean said. “And once again, I kept thinking—there has to be a better option.”\n\nAround 2009 or 2010, Bean decided to act on that instinct.\n\n“I started putting some ideas down on paper,” he said. Working with a local orthotist in South Bend, he began the long process of turning concept into reality. It took several years of refinement, but eventually, they had something that worked.\n\nThat something became the TayCo Brace.\n\nVisually, it immediately stood apart from anything else on the market.\n\n“First off, our brace goes over the shoe,” Bean said. “That alone sets it apart from most ankle braces out there.”\n\nBut the design wasn’t just about looking different—it was about function.\n\n“I wanted something that would support the ankle without compromising the shoe,” he explained. “And I wanted people to be able to wear their orthotics too.”\n\n“I wanted to support more than just one part of the ankle,” Bean said. “The ankle, the heel or hindfoot, and the midfoot. Supporting all of those areas is a huge benefit.”\n\nThat design is especially important for high ankle sprains, which affect rotational movement.\n\n“Our brace minimizes that rotation so the injury can heal safer and quicker,” he said.\n\nWhile Bean is quick to point out that no brace replaces proper treatment and rehabilitation, he believes the TayCo Brace plays a critical role in restoring confidence—something that’s just as important as physical healing.\n\n“The brace isn’t the savior,” he said. “The athlete still has to rehab. The ankle has to get stronger. Swelling has to come down safely.”\n\nWhat the brace does provide is the ability to return to normal movement patterns almost immediately.\n\n“They can walk with a normal gait pattern pretty much from the beginning, and pain-free,” Bean said. “That allows them to retain strength while they heal.”\n\nJust as important, it removes fear.\n\n“It gives them confidence that their ankle isn’t going to give out,” he explained. “It takes away the fear of reinjury before they’re fully back to strength.”\n\nWhether it’s planting during a football play or sprinting down the first-base line, that confidence can make all the difference.\n\nFrom a trainer’s perspective, Bean believes the TayCo Brace has changed how ankle injuries are managed altogether.\n\n“Ankles are meant to move,” he said. “The first thing we want to do with an ankle injury is get you moving.”\n\nTraditional walking boots often limit that movement—but they also create new problems.\n\n“When you put someone in a walking boot, it raises one hip higher than the other,” Bean said. “That can lead to hip or back injuries, and muscle atrophy.”\n\nBecause the TayCo Brace allows normal gait and movement, athletes can maintain strength and progress into advanced rehab sooner.\n\n“It gets you back into your activities as quickly—and safely—as possible,” he said.\n\nLike many athletic trainers, Bean was used to fabricating braces and splints as part of the job. Introducing the TayCo Brace followed that same organic path.\n\n“We tried it in practice for quite some time before ever using it in games,” he said. “We had really great success, and it just kind of snowballed from there.”\n\nSoon, athletes were asking for it by name.\n\n“Now I’ve got guys coming into my office saying their ankle hurts and asking if they can use one during practice,” Bean said.\n\nThat trust eventually extended far beyond Notre Dame—into collegiate and professional sports nationwide.\n\nSeeing the brace highlighted on ESPN during a recent pregame broadcast was a moment that caught even Bean by surprise.\n\n“I thought, wow—that’s some cheap advertising,” he joked. “But it was really gratifying to see people taking notice.”\n\nWhat Bean never anticipated was how far beyond athletics the brace would reach.\n\nIn 2016, he partnered with Dr. Fred Ferlic of South Bend Orthopaedics, who shared Bean’s frustration with walking boots and saw the potential for something better.\n\nTogether, they expanded the TayCo Brace into multiple versions: for military training, workers wearing steel-toed boots, senior citizens with ankle instability, post-surgical rehab patients, and even individuals with neurological disorders.\n\n“We’ve used it with patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome,” Bean said. “It’s helped preserve their gait and prevent their ankles from buckling.”\n\nThe feedback has been overwhelming.\n\n“Hearing from people who were homebound and can now get out and walk safely—that’s what really moved the needle for me,” he said. “Helping people get back to their lives is why we do this.”\n\nWhile seeing the TayCo Brace used in the NFL, college athletics, and high schools is gratifying, Bean says those moments pale in comparison to something much simpler.\n\n“Seeing an elderly man or woman able to go to the grocery store again—that’s the most gratifying thing for me,” he said.\n\nEven the name of the brace reflects how personal the journey has been.\n\n“It comes from my family,” Bean said. “Tay is from my oldest daughter Taylor, and Co is from my wife Colleen and my youngest daughter Courtney.”\n\nFor a man who spent his career quietly helping athletes recover behind the scenes, the TayCo Brace represents something bigger than innovation.\n\nIt represents a lifetime spent asking one simple question—and refusing to stop until he found the answer:\n\nFor a man who spent 36 years serving Notre Dame student-athletes, it feels fitting that Mike Bean’s most lasting impact extends far beyond the sidelines. The same care, patience, and athlete-first mindset that defined his time in the training room now lives on through the TayCo Brace—helping people of all ages return to movement, confidence, and independence. It’s a reminder that some of the most meaningful contributions to the game aren’t made under the lights, but in the quiet work of helping others heal.\n\nYou can learn more about the TayCo brace here: Keep Your Shoes with TayCo Brace – Walking Boot/AFO Alternative",

    "fullText": "Heading into the winter transfer window, Manchester United’s midfield was considered the biggest issue for Ruben Amorim’s side.\n\nAmorim departed and Michael Carrick stepped in to replace him on the touchline. Still, United’s midfield options remain the same, as the club’s hierarchy were reluctant to make short-term signings mid-season.\n\nUnited’s preferred targets, Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton, all Premier League-proven midfielders, were not available for sale in January. The Red Devils now plan to sign at least one of the trio in the summer.\n\nAccording to Fichajes, United have “already begun preliminary talks” to sign Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton.\n\nLiverpool and Real Madrid have also entered the race to sign the England international, who is considered the most technically gifted midfielder in the country.\n\nThe 21-year-old’s contract in South London runs until 2029. However, he is expected to depart Selhurst Park this summer.\n\nAware of the growing interest in their midfield maestro, Palace have placed a €95 million price tag on him.\n\nThe Eagles reportedly know they have “a game-changing player” and are accordingly ready to capitalise on his meteoric rise.\n\nThe Spanish outlet claims United “urgently need” a reliable partner for Kobbie Mainoo in the middle of the park.\n\nThe arrival of Carrick has led to Mainoo’s resurgence, and the United academy product is set to be handed a new contract.\n\nHowever, his current partner, Casemiro, will depart Old Trafford at the end of the season.\n\nIt is believed United want to sign Wharton, who has drawn comparisons to Carrick for his calmness in tight spaces, to fill the Brazilian’s void and form a quality double pivot alongside Mainoo.\n\nFeatured image Justin Setterfield via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "The Iowa Hawkeyes (17-5, 7-4) overcame a 7-point halftime deficit to beat the Washington Huskies (12-11, 4-8) 84-74. Bennett Stirtz led the way with 22 points on 8/13 shooting. He added 5 assists to just 1 turnover. Alvaro Folgueiras was a boost off the bench with 16 & Cooper Koch added 11, all of them coming in the second half.\n\nIt was an absolute barn-burner of a first half. Felt like it was constantly teetering for the Hawks. Not only did Iowa give up an 11-0 run early but they had to withstand the Huskies hitting 11 straight baskets before their last second shot went awry. The numbers are astonishing. 1.55 points/possession allowed; 111.5% eFG%; scored on 67.7% of their possessions.\n\nYet the Hawks remained in striking distance, down 48-41 at half. It was thanks to their own impressive efficiency by scoring on 63.3% of possessions. They also converted 7 Husky turnovers into 13 points. Alvaro Folgueiras came off the bench for 12 first half points and Bennett Stirtz added 9.\n\nIn the second half, Iowa quickly cut their deficit. Stirtz got it going by getting to the line, going 1/2, then drilling a 3. Shortly after, Tavion Banks (whose free throw streak ended at 30 earlier in the game) converted a 4-point play and cut it to 52-49.\n\nIowa held the Huskies without a field goal for 6+ minutes and they were able to flip it to a 7-point lead behind some beautiful basketball which culminated in a Stirtz 3 to get the Hawks.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes without a point and Iowa up 3 after a Cam Manyawu dunk, the commentator noted it felt like it was Stirtz’s time. He got a clean 3 and followed it up with a transition dunk to get the lead back to 8 with 7:08 remaining.\n\nThe Huskies broke a 3+ minute scoring drought to bring it to a 7-point lead for Iowa, the shot clock was dwindling down and the ball found Cooper Koch. After passing up an open look against USC earlier this season, he drained a three with Hanne Steinbach draping him to get the lead to 10.\n\nAfter that, it was pretty much formalities. A “Let’s go Hawks” chant broke out. Danny Sprinkles raised a huff because Iowa masterfully allowed the clock to drain after a made basket with 1:02 left. Tate Sage and Folgueiras played keep away on a shot clock violation turnover, which was Iowa’s 4th of the game.\n\nNext up: Sunday, February 8th v Northwestern (2:00P CST, Fox Sports 1)",

    "fullText": "What HSV can do, TSG Hoffenheim can certainly do as well. For example, securing a point against Bayern. Maybe even more?\n\nIn line with this motto, TSG key player Grischa Prömel expressed his thoughts in an interview with 'Sky' in the week leading up to the clash with FC Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena.\n\nHe referred not only to the upcoming duel on Sunday but also to the overall championship race in the Bundesliga. As a reminder: Borussia Dortmund is in second place, six points behind the leaders, followed by Hoffenheim, nine points behind Bayern.\n\n\"We hope we can make it exciting,\" Prömel explained to 'Sky'. At times, it seemed as if Bayern would completely dominate, he admitted. However, he himself is a fan of keeping things exciting for as long as possible.\n\n📸 Stuart Franklin - 2026 Getty Images\n\nHe then made a promise to the TSG fans and, in a way, to everyone who wishes for a real championship race in the Bundesliga: \"We will do everything in our power to keep it alive.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old was indeed impressed by the quality of the record champions, who sometimes play in their own league and have a squad full of world-class players. At the same time, the midfielder urged his team not to hide: \"We are still unbeaten this year.\"\n\nWith five wins from five games, TSG can travel to Munich with confidence. \"We are convinced that we can hold our ground in Munich,\" said Prömel.\n\nNow it remains to be seen to what extent this confidence will be justified on Sunday at 5:30 PM and whether TSG will indeed have a say in the title race.\n\nThis article was translated into English by Artificial Intelligence.

I thought it was over. I couldn't fathom a world where I would ever be back,\" she said.\n\nThe 25-year-old took four months away from her sport to recover.\n\nIn November, just over six months after her surgery, she won a national title at the British Championships.\n\n\"I think you often don't stand back and look at how far you've come.\n\n\"I've worked my life to become an Olympian and that's my story,\" Spours added.\n\nHospital patients face car park charge 'confusion'\n\nNew health centre to ease hospital pressures\n\nResident safe after fire badly damages bungalow\n\nEd Appleby, 21, travels from his home in Colchester to train in Swindon.\n\nDespite his ankle injury, he defended his British title in November 2025.\n\n\"We know that the hard work has been done, we just need to follow it through,\" said Appleby.\n\nAppleby said he had dedicated the past few years completely to training and had taken a break from education after his A-levels, but plans to go to university in September.\n\nHe said the ambition for this Olympics is not a medal but a \"sense of achievement to actually be there and soak up the moment and just make the most of that experience\".\n\nChris Boyadji, who coaches the pair, said seeing them compete would be a \"magical moment\".\n\nBoyadji said the injury worries resulted in a \"slow start\" to the season but that they both \"fought very well and I'm very pleased that we're in this position right now\".\n\n\"I'm proud of what we've been able to accomplish with the skaters,\" he added.\n\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "description": "What do you do if you fall 40 feet on to hard-packed snow? If you're a Winter Olympics athlete, you pick yourself up and try again.",
    "fullText": "What do you do if you fall 40 feet on to hard-packed snow? If you're a Winter Olympian, you pick yourself up and try again.\n\nThere is a fine line between success and failure in winter sports, where a few millimetres when landing difficult tricks on snow can make the difference between a medal or serious injury.\n\nDealing with the fear of what might happen if things go wrong is just as important for an elite Winter OIympic athlete as honing any other skill of their craft.\n\nThe jeopardy is real as athletes heading to the Milan-Cortina Games push the limits of what is physically possible in their sports while pushing themselves out of their comfort zones.\n\n\"The biggest challenge of my sport is definitely overcoming the fear,\" says freestyle skier and Team GB Winter Olympic medal hopeful Zoe Atkin, who is preparing for her second Winter Games.\n\nThe 23-year-old competes in ski halfpipe, where competitors drop into a 22-foot deep pipe and complete as many tricks as they can while jumping as high out of the halfpipe as possible.\n\nThey are judged on the amplitude - the height they reach - as well as the difficulty of the tricks and how well they have executed them.\n\nStanford University student Atkin is studying symbolic systems in the United States. It has aided in her quest to emulate older sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal.\n\n\"Symbolic systems is interdisciplinary. It's a lot to do with computer science as well as cognitive science. It's studying machines that simulate the brain.\n\n\"Being able to understand fear from a biological process has helped me on the slopes,\" she says.\n\nFor Atkin, fear is at its lowest, maybe unexpectedly, on competition day.\n\n\"That's just nervousness around the result and performing to your best, which is easier to combat,\" she tells BBC Sport. \"I do meditation in the morning, to focus on the now.\n\n\"The fear comes in training; when you are practising something you are not familiar with, that is when the uncertainty comes in.\n\n\"When a spectator watches a sport, they might think we are adrenaline junkies. But it is very precise - we are just a niche athlete.\"\n\nZoe's sister Izzy claimed slopestyle bronze in Pyeongchang in 2018.\n\nIt gave Britain a first skiing medal at a Winter Olympics - 16 years after Alain Baxter lost his slalom bronze when he failed a drugs test after using an over-the-counter nasal decongestant that he believed to be permitted.\n\nZoe was watching from the stands eight years ago in South Korea with her parents, and her sister's achievements spurred her on to pursue her own skiing career.\n\n\"Working with a sports psychologist has been important - when I was younger, I felt more intense fear, which was a barrier to performance,\" Atkin says.\n\n\"I am pretty young still, but there were a lot of expectations internally, things I want to achieve.\"\n\nShe heads into the Games as the reigning world champion and this season has finished on the podium in each of the World Cups, including a win at Copper Mountain and claimed gold at the X Games.\n\n\"Now I've won things, surely I shouldn't be afraid and I should have confidence?\" she says.\n\n\"But no matter how established you are, there's always a comfort zone you need to push to progress. It's always a continuous progress, a journey I now have more fully embraced.\"\n\nAtkin has been fortunate in that she has avoided serious injuries, unlike her sister who broke her pelvis just before the 2022 Winter Olympics and has since retired from competitive skiing.\n\nGB team-mate Kirsty Muir has also had her fair share of injuries.\n\nThe 21-year-old competes in ski slopestyle and big air. She rides rails and performs tricks of large ramps.\n\nShe knows all too well about the horrors of serious injury in the line of duty.\n\nIn December 2023, a scan revealed that repeated blows to her knee had resulted in a torn cruciate ligament, ruling her out for a year.\n\nMuir, having \"never not skied for that long in my life\", says she is fit and firing for Milan-Cortina – but admits the road back was hard.\n\n\"The sport progresses continually, so having that much time off was difficult,\" Muir tells BBC Sport.\n\nMuir has won World Cup events in ski slopestyle and big air this season and also won at the X Games but is no stranger to the occasional crash landing.\n\nThe key to overcoming that fear, she says, is accepting they will happen.\n\n\"The injury wasn't my scariest, as it didn't happen at a specific moment,\" she says. \"It's more when things out of your control go wrong.\n\n\"I've had skis come off my feet or my goggles come over my eyes when about to jump, and I've been flying through the air without skis on my feet. That is a weird feeling.\n\n\"We are good at adapting to situations, not thinking about it until it happens. There is no point in worrying - be prepared, then adapt.\"\n\nIn the moment before beginning a run, with a giant halfpipe or slopestyle course or big air jump in front of them, what is running through an athlete's mind?\n\nAtkin thinks of nothing at all.\n\n\"Meditation is more like an umbrella term for mindfulness,\" she says. \"But I do sit down, doing the hand pose, for about 10 minutes before going up. You can overthink things and overinflate the risks, wonder if fears are plausible and reframing them - it lets me disregard thoughts that are unhelpful, like 'what if I fall?'.\n\n\"I've had scary falls. It is all part of the process; it takes a certain mental strength - to be OK with falling.\n\n\"Part of our training is falling safely; if you are about to over-rotate, it is better to open and land on your side. That air awareness is something you train on. We can take big falls and know we are prepared to take them.\n\n\"I was working on this trick I previously had a mental block on.\n\n\"I would sit at the top, full of fear, trip and fall on my hip repeatedly. But I committed to finishing it - little steps every day, pushing myself to confront my fear. That allowed myself to build my confidence, and it felt like a personal victory as well.\"\n\nGB Snowsport, the national governing body, has worked with athletes on calming techniques – including by taking some freediving, to learn how to stay focused when out of their comfort zone, as well as breathing techniques under high pressure.\n\nAccording to Muir, the best way to prepare is to start that preparation long, long before you drop in.\n\n\"The times I feel fear are when I am trying something new, that feels more like a leap of faith,\" she says.\n\n\"When we are going for a new trick, it is never from zero to 100. You do each step to make sure you are comfortable. Then you go for it, which is difficult.\n\n\"I centre myself - there is a moment you have got to try. Those moments are scariest, but most rewarding. It is thinking toward that moment.\n\n\"The most important thing is accepting that our sport is risky, but it is something I have chosen to do. I am the one in control.\n\n\"At the top of the course, all those thoughts go away - I try to think it's just me and the course, and put in the best run I can.\"\n\nIn the battle to make sure fear doesn't win, Atkin and Muir have very different approaches.\n\nAtkin says: \"I can tell me it is just bodily reactions, and it is understandable - it would be crazy if I didn't feel fear. Just reframing fear as something more positive, that you can do it even if you have that fear.\n\n\"If you were to take a regular person and drop them in a halfpipe, logically you feel fear. But we train our whole lives for one specific thing.\"\n\nMuir's attitude is a little less logical. While thoroughly grounded in training and technique as a world champion athlete, there is also superstition and a little bit of music sprinkled in the mix.\n\n\"I have a lucky snood - the face masks people use when they ski - always on my person,\" she says.\n\n\"I got it off one of the skiers I admired at the dry ski slope when I was younger, and I've always had it with me.\n\n\"And I have The Pretender by Foo Fighters as my competition song - I only play it at comps, that helps me switch off. Then during training, I have rock music.\n\n\"My dad listened to rock, and my sister loves [Foo Fighters singer Dave Grohl's former band] Nirvana, so I started listening and it spiralled from there.\"",

    "description": "Nearly every Bruin on the roster got involved in the 40 point win Wednesday night.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES - There was a Big Ten mismatch on Wednesday in Pauley Pavilion when No. 2 UCLA (22-1, 12-0) hosted Rutgers (9-14, 1-11) and came out the other end with an 86-46 victory to remain undefeated in conference play.\n\nA matchup between the top and bottom teams in the Big Ten was expected to end in Bruin domination and by the end of the first quarter, where UCLA went on a 17-0 run at one point and finished the quarter ahead 26-6, the game looked pretty much over.\n\nThat comfort meant that UCLA head coach Cori Close had some freedom to experiment with different rotations and utilize players like freshman forward Sienna Betts, freshman guard Lena Bilic and redshirt-sophomore forward Amanda Muse much earlier in the game than they'd appear normally.\n\nMuse played 20 minutes, her second-most minutes this season, while Bilic played 20 minutes herself and Betts played close to 24 minutes while scoring 11 points, the same amount her older sister senior center Lauren Betts scored in the game.\n\n\"I'm sure she'll [Sienna Betts] rub that in quite a bit,\" Close said.\n\nThe benefit of rotations that are uncommon to the team is that it gives them an opportunity to try out combinations with each other they otherwise wouldn't have a chance to. It also means that the starters have a chance to rest their bodies in a game where the stakes are much lower and the end result is all but guaranteed.\n\n\"We mixed up our rotations a little bit. It's a long year. We want to protect our bodies a little bit,\" senior guard Kiki Rice said. \"It's also a great opportunity to play with other people. To work on actions together and how we play with each other and we need to be able to play with different lineups because there's going to be times where that's going to happen throughout the year.\"\n\nJordan Teller - The Sporting Tribune\n\nKiki Rice #1 of the UCLA Bruins drives towards the basket during an NCAA basketball game against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights, Wednesday February 4, 2026 in Los Angeles, Calif.\n\nWednesday's game was extra special because it fell on National Girls and Women in Sports Day. To celebrate UCLA involved several young women in the game production, with squeaky voices calling out over the loudspeaker to introduce players or announce a made basket.\n\nFor the players, it's another reminder of the privilege they have to make an impact as the next generation of role models for young women athletes.\n\n\"It's super special that we can do that and have the little girls be out there learning new skills... It's just really cool to see that and what's super cool about our program... there's lots of families here and there's little kids that look up to us. It's super cool because they are familiar faces to us so we do recognize the people that come to our games and we really appreciate it. Just super cool that we can do this game and lift women up,\" senior forward Gabriela Jaquez said.\n\nFor Close, a day like Wednesday's game reminds her of the role models in women's sports that she was looking for growing up but couldn't always find.\n\nIt also reminded her of all the programs and opportunities that exist now, and that UCLA is a part of, to give women more positions in the sports world as athletes, coaches, trainers, hosts and broadcasters.\n\n\"I wish I had women to look up to at that age that I could go and see,\" Close said. \"I am such a hoop head and I would watch as much basketball as my mom would let me, but there were no options to watch women and girls as I was growing up. It was all men's basketball.... What a privilege when you can combine trying to master your craft and compete at the highest levels and inspire somebody else and impact a heart. How lucky are we?\"",

    "description": "Eagles OL coach Jeff Stoutland has left team.",
    "fullText": "Eagles offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland announced on Wednesday night that he won’t return next season after 13 seasons with the team.\n\n“Philadelphia, I’ve decided my time coaching with the Eagles has come to an end,” Stoutland posted on X. “When I arrived here in 2013, I did not know what I was signing up for. I quickly learned what this city demands. But more importantly, what it gives back. The past 13 years have been the great privilege of my coaching career. I didn’t just work here, I became one of you. Stout out.”\n\nStoutland is a humongous loss for an Eagles’ offense in transition. Over the last two decades, he has consistently developed elite offensive lines and elite individual players. It’s a big reason why the Eagles have made three Super Bowls since the 2017-2018 season, winning two of them.\n\nWithout Stoutland, the Eagles would have struggled to achieve that success. He turned Lane Johnson and Jason Kelce into Hall-of-Fame-caliber players, while also turning rugby player Jordan Mailata into an All-Pro left tackle. Those are a few of his success stories. There are many more.\n\nNow, the Eagles must find Stoutland’s replacement, which won’t be an easy task. This will be one of several crucial decisions that new offensive coordinator Sean Mannion has to make during his first offseason. He must nail the hire to get the offense back on track.\n\nAccording to NFL Network, Stoutland could stay around to help Philadelphia’s organization in some capacity.",

Moving to a club of Bayern’s stature could take some time to get used to and all these mega-money stars may exhibit signs of having a big ego…or so Bischof thought.\n\n“Before I moved to Munich, I couldn’t imagine that Bayern stars could be so normal. I don’t even know what I expected. Maybe that they’d be unapproachable,” Bischof admitted (as captured by X account @iMiaSanMia). “But not at all. First, [Joshua] Kimmich’s message surprised me. Then an encounter with Manuel Neuer. I was in the elevator with Aleks Pavlović, and then he came in. And he was so funny, so down-to-earth, so amusing, and above all, so nice. The Bayern dressing room is truly an exceptional place. A place full of energy and determination, yet still comfortable.”\n\nOne may argue that even Vincent Kompany, known for giving players a real dressing down when he sees fit to do so, is a great guy to be around with. Just remember to put your shinpads on if he’s going to sub you on.",

    "fullText": "Andre Onana will be leaving Manchester United for good when he returns from his loan spell with Trabzonspor at the end of the season.\n\nIndeed, the Red Devils have come to the conclusion that there is simply no benefit in keeping hold of the Cameroonian beyond this summer.\n\nThey are keen to cash in while his contract still has two years remaining, although they’ve likely conceded that they won’t get a fee anywhere near the £43.8 million they shelled out for him back in July 2023.\n\n*Onana’s complete record at United in all competitions (Transfermarkt)\n\n(Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nFabrizio Romano weighed in on his situation on YouTube this week, telling United fans: “Who’s going to leave the club? For sure, in the summer, it’s going to be Andre Onana.\n\n“Onana is on loan at Trabzonspor, and Man United’s decision is already quite clear: they’re not expected to continue with Onana next summer. The idea is to part ways and find a solution.”\n\nWhen Onana joined the Turkish outfit in September, there was no buy option or obligation included in the terms, meaning Trabzonspor would have to open talks with United if they were looking to sign him permanently come June.\n\nIt remains to be seen where the 29-year-old will choose to ply his trade next, having represented Ajax and Inter Milan at senior level after starting out in Barcelona’s academy.\n\n(Photo by CARLO HERMANN/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nLast week, reports claimed that Onana’s representatives had met with Inter chiefs to discuss a possible return this year.\n\nHe spent one season in Milan and won the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana before reaching the Champions League final, where Inter fell to a narrow 1-0 defeat to Manchester City. Even though he finished as a runner-up, Onana was deemed one of the standout performers of the clash.\n\nRomano is yet to hear of any definitive links between the ‘keeper and his former club, though. He said of the matter: “There were reports in England about a potential return to Inter. I’m not aware of that.\n\n“His agents were in Milan, yes, but his agents are in a powerful agency that is working on several deals, and they were in Milan on separate topics, not for an Inter move [for Onana].\n\n“But there will be several clubs interested in Onana. He’ll assess all his options, and what I can tell you today is that Onana is expected to leave Manchester United and try a different kind of experience in the 2026/27 season.”\n\n‘What I can tell you’: Romano announces that Man Utd have decided to sell senior Red this summer despite 2028 contract\n\nMEN: Blow for Carrick as Man Utd ‘leader’ and one other Red absent from training before hosting Spurs\n\nOfficial: Man Utd top target signs contract until June 2029",

Jobe has become a key component in Seattle’s Nickel defensive along with rookie Nick Emmanwori.\n\nAccording to the NFL’s Next Gen Stats, Jobe ranks sixth in fewest yards per target allowed among defensive backs this season, including playoffs.

Head coach Mike Macdonald is another component. The 38-year-old coach was asked Wednesday about Jobe’s journey from practice squad to Super Bowl starter and how far along he’s come.\n\n“It’s a great example of … the pride that we take and how we run our program,” Macdonald said. “If you play great football and you’re a great teammate, you’re gonna get an opportunity to play. Josh was someone we acquired at the beginning of last year. The guy just came in and made a ton of plays on our ready squad.\n\nMORE: Sam Darnold makes case for ex-teammate Frank Gore to enter the Hall of Fame\n\n“I remember our veteran receivers saying, ‘Hey, this guy’s pretty dang good.’ He kept making plays and when there was an opportunity for him to get on the field, we felt really confident for him to go out there and do his job.

    "description": "Penn State now has an incoming freshman class of 15 recruits, and most of them originally signed with Iowa State before following Campbell to his new school.",
    "fullText": "College football’s February signing period is pretty much an afterthought for most schools nowadays, but it meant plenty to new Penn State coach Matt Campbell.\n\nPenn State signed only two high school recruits during the December signing period because the Nittany Lions hadn’t yet hired Campbell away from Iowa State. That left Campbell quite busy trying to put together a freshman class while also working the transfer portal and hiring his staff.\n\n“The last two months has been a whirlwind in a multitude of different ways,” Campbell said Wednesday.\n\nPenn State now has an incoming freshman class of 15 recruits, and most of them originally signed with Iowa State before following Campbell to his new school. Most of the high school seniors who initially had committed to Penn State landed at Virginia Tech in December after James Franklin was fired as the Nittany Lions’ coach and got hired by the Hokies.\n\nAlthough Penn State’s class still ranks in the bottom third of the Big Ten, according to composite rankings of recruiting sites compiled by 247Sports, it looks much greater than it did a couple of months ago. Penn State also had added over three dozen transfers, with the majority of them also coming over from Iowa State.\n\nOne of the top former Iowa State recruits to end up at Penn State is edge rusher Elijah Reeder. He can team up with December signee Jackson Ford to give the Nittany Lions a pair of promising pass-rushing prospects.“Big, powerful, strong kid,” said Tom Loy, a national recruiting analyst for 247Sports. “Just want to continue to see him keep his motor up, keep the weight down, but he’s a guy Nebraska’s very excited about.”\n\nNotre Dame also made some news Wednesday by signing quarterback Teddy Jarrard, who had been a 2027 prospect before reclassifying. The move enabled Jarrard to sign with Notre Dame on Wednesday and begin his college career this fall.\n\nJarrard will have a chance to compete for the right to serve as the main backup to returning starter CJ Carr. Kenny Minchey, who backed up Carr this past season, has transferred to Kentucky.\n\nMinchey’s exit leaves Carr, Jarrard, incoming freshman Noah Grubbs and Blake Hebert as Notre Dame’s only scholarship quarterbacks. Hebert didn’t play as a true freshman this past season.\n\n“You look at the size, the frame, the mechanics, there’s a lot to like about Teddy Jarrard,” Loy said. “I think he’s the most likely next-up option after CJ Carr.”\n\nPenn State was an anomaly in signing most of its incoming freshman class in February rather than December. Virtually all the major college prospects now finalize their college plans in December as the February signing date has faded in relevance.\n\nOne notable player who remained uncommitted heading into the February signing period was edge rusher Dylan Berymon, who announced he will play for Nebraska. Berymon is the nation’s No. 223 prospect in his class, according to the 247Sports Composite.",

    "title": "BMW's Newest \"Innovation\" Is a Logo-Shaped Middle Finger to Right to Repair",
    "description": "BMW filed a patent for a proprietary screw that looks like the BMW logo. They say it looks cool, we’re worried it’s going to stifle repairs.",
    "fullText": "If you haven’t already heard, BMW’s R&D teams have been busy “innovating.” Unfortunately, they aren’t focusing on the things that actually matter—like stellar engine performance or the legendary driving dynamics that gearheads love. Instead, the C-suite execs decided that the best use of their engineering budget was to design a proprietary security screw specifically intended to prevent BMW drivers from fixing their own cars.\n\nAt first glance, it’s almost cute: a screw head shaped exactly like the BMW logo. But the novelty wears off the moment you consider the physics. Because this head prioritizes branding over utility, neither the bit nor the screw head can withstand the torque of a standard Torx or Hex fastener. The result? Broken bits, stripped screws, and more time spent on what would otherwise be a simple task.\n\nIt’s a masterpiece of anti-functional design. To the casual observer, it seems to serve no purpose other than to look “cool”, but when it comes to the nitty gritty of DIY repair, it ensures that a standard toolbox is useless for basic maintenance. In fact, the patent explicitly states this as a function of its design in section [0006]: “…to prevent being loosened or tightened…by unauthorized individuals.”\n\nThis type of insular protectionism isn’t a one off either, it’s baked into the corporate culture. Our CEO Kyle Wiens observed this firsthand during a visit to BMW’s Recycling and Dismantling Center (RDC) located in Landshut just north of Munich, Germany. It’s a peculiar, one of a kind facility that recovers materials from pre-production and prototype vehicles that will never reach consumer hands. The RDC processes a few thousand vehicles each year which represents only a tiny fraction of the more than one million cars BMW produced in 2025 in Germany alone.\n\nBMW doesn’t seem shy about declaring the RDC’s mission either, proclaiming it a “template for the industry” while stating: “In view of new regulations and the BMW Group’s ambitious targets, the RDC will play an even more important role going forward…” (italics for emphasis). New regulations certainly have a way of encouraging ambitious targets, that’s for sure.\n\nTheir barely-passive hostility towards repair and recycling is even less hidden on the operations floor. As Kyle noted during his visit, BMW’s engineers developed a clever tool to drain oil from shock absorbers so the oil could be reused: “When a member of my tour group asked if BMW sold it to other refurbishers, the man holding the tool looked confused, as though the suggestion was patently absurd. That tool was their intellectual property; it was developed by BMW for BMW. And the patent they filed for the tool ensures that no-one else can invent something similar.” So much for a “template for the industry.”\n\n“That tool was their intellectual property; it was developed by BMW for BMW. And the patent they filed for the tool ensures that no-one else can invent something similar.”\n\nIn BMW’s defense—and the defense of an ever-growing list of manufacturers desperate to gatekeep their ecosystems—this isn’t their first dumb idea. Heck, they’re not even the first to use security screws, the first dates back to the one-way screw of the early 1900s. Since then, we’ve seen a parade of “tamperproof” fasteners flood the market, including some very insidious designs like the Pentalobe screws used on iPhones.\n\nThe justifications are always the same: anti-theft measures or “protecting” the user from dangerous components. While those excuses might hold water for public infrastructure or high-voltage utility boxes, they fall apart when applied to consumer products. In your garage, these aren’t safety features; they are barriers to ownership.\n\nTo be clear, it’s not like we’re anti-new screws or anything, as evidenced by our resident mechanical engineers waxing poetic about the functional benefits of strip resistant Torx Plus screws when compared to regular old Torx or Hex. Fasteners, like all things, are subject to improvement over time and we’re all for it. That’s not what proprietary security screws are designed to do though.\n\nAs with any cash-grab engineered to stifle repair, the DIY community isn’t taking it lying down. Our friends over at Adafruit didn’t even need a physical screw to win this round; they used BMW’s own spurious patent filings to map the dimensions and 3D-print a replica bit to defeat the lock.\n\nThis is where BMW’s plan hits a wall. We’re living in an era where the efforts of industrial giants can be unraveled by a hobbyist with a $200 printer and a bit of ingenuity. The fact that a grassroots effort can dismantle a multi-million dollar “security” initiative in a matter of days speaks volumes.\n\nThe tide is turning. Across the US, we’re making massive strides in securing the right to repair our stuff, and that includes both commercial and consumer vehicles. In this climate, BMW’s move to lock down hardware with proprietary screws is tone-deaf and will be seen for the desperate cash-grab that it is.",

To prepare, we've polished several\ndemos and are cooking up some new ones. Today, the spotlight is on the refreshed printer demo:\n\nPart of the magic of Slint is the live-preview showing your changes instantly. However, we've had some tricky bugs that resulted in the preview sometimes being out of date.\nLeon, our newest team member, dived right in and fixed these issues.\n\nUp until this release, GridLayout was rather basic and static. Thanks to major contributions by David Faure, grid layouts are now fully dynamic:\n\nThis makes it easy to build data driven tables, such as this example:\n\nHere's another example from our refreshed printer demo, where the cell placement is computed:\n\nTwo-way bindings\nare a powerful mechanism to implement bi-directional flow of data. In this release, we've extended our implementation\nso that they can be used on struct fields:\n\nPython is a dynamically typed programming language, where type hints can be added and checked with additional tools such as mypy or ty. In this release, we've added type hinting for Python to the slint compiler. This also comes\nwith a more convenient way of loading .slint files in Python:\n\nImport the file in your Python code to load and access the Slint UI and get coverage for Python static type checkers,\nsuch as mypy or ty.\n\nThe type checker will find this before running the code:\n\nWhen importing the generated .py file at run-time, Slint will verify that your API is still compatible.\n\nThis release adds supports for the safe and virtual keyboard areas on iOS and Android:\n\nWe've also updated our getting started guides on iOS and on Android.\n\nHere are a few more things we added:\n\nFor a complete list of all changes, check out the full ChangeLog.\n\nDon’t forget to star us on GitHub, join our Mattermost chat, and share your projects.\n\nBig thanks to everyone who contributed code, fixes, or feedback.

    "description": "A discussion about California Governor Gavin Newsom's presidential prospects ended with Jessica Tarlov telling Jesse Watters, \"You're gross.\"",
    "fullText": "A discussion about California Governor Gavin Newsom’s presidential prospects ended with Jessica Tarlov telling Jesse Watters, “You’re gross.”\n\nOn Wednesday’s installment of The Five on Fox News, Tarlov said Newsom’s opponents will attempt to use California as a cudgel to try to derail his aspirations.\n\n“There’s push and pull, but this is what the debate is going to be,” she said. “Like when he was up there with Ron DeSantis when they did that debate with Sean Hannity and, they went California v. Florida. And when you come from a coastal state, especially one as big as California, and they definitely had some bad years. We covered a lot of poop on the sidewalks in San Francisco and things like that. It’s going to be tough in a Democratic Primary. But he’s not afraid of the challenge. And Democrats are looking for someone at this moment who will stand up and fight. And he is ready to do that.”\n\nWatters responded by questioning whether Newsom’s identity as a straight white man will pose an issue in 2028. Co-host Greg Gutfeld also jumped in and helped send the segment off the rails:\n\nWATTERS: And he’s a straight white man. Is that gonna be a problem, Jessica?TARLOV: I am very into straight white men myself. I married one. So, I think it’s gonna be fine.WATTERS: Ok.GUTFELD: How dare you.TARLOV: What? Him or me?GUTFELD: You are now into straight white men?TARLOV: Not exclusively. I like everybody, I guess, but I married one.GUTFELD: Ok.WATTERS: Is he Christian?TARLOV: Brian was raised Catholic.WATTERS: Ok, just checking. Just wanna make sure we check all the boxes.TARLOV: Also, all religions are good and fine.GUTFELD: All of them?WATTERS: I like it on the record here. Even Islam?TARLOV: Get out. You’re really gross.WATTERS: I’m just kidding. We love Muslims.\n\nThe post ‘You’re Really Gross’: Jessica Tarlov Disgusted by Jesse Watters’ Questions About Her Dating Preferences first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "In the video, Savannah Guthrie spoke directly to her mother, Nancy Guthrie, and also pleaded for her safe return.",
    "fullText": "Savannah Guthrie shared a video message on Instagram on Wednesday pleading for her mother's safe return.\n\nGuthrie's mother, Nancy Guthrie, has been missing since Sunday. She was last seen at her home outside Tucson, Arizona. Officials told NBC Nightly News on Monday that they believe she was \"taken out of her home against her will.\"\n\nGuthrie appeared in the video alongside her siblings, Annie and Camron, and read from a prepared statement — at one point, addressing the people who may have her mother.\n\n\"As a family, we are doing everything that we can. We are ready to talk. However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated,\" Guthrie said.\n\n\"We need to know, without a doubt, that she is alive, and that you have her. We want to hear from you, and we are ready to listen. Please, reach out to us,\" she said.\n\nA post shared by Savannah Guthrie (@savannahguthrie)\n\nIn the nearly four-minute-long video, Guthrie described her mother as a \"kind, faithful, loyal, fiercely loving woman of goodness and light,\" and a person who is \"funny, spunky, and clever.\"\n\n\"Our mom is our heart and our home. She is 84 years old. Her health, her heart is fragile. She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer,\" Guthrie added.\n\nIn the closing seconds of the video, Guthrie spoke directly to her mother.\n\n\"Everyone is looking for you, Mommy, everywhere. We will not rest. Your children will not rest until we are together again,\" she said. \"We speak to you every moment. And we pray without ceasing, and we rejoice in advance for the day that we hold you in our arms again. We love you, Mommy.\"\n\nBoth of Guthrie's siblings also spoke, with her sister Annie saying she and her siblings are \"just normal human people who need our mom.\"\n\n\"Mama, mama, if you're listening, we need you to come home. We miss you,\" she said.\n\nNear the end of the video, Guthrie's brother Camron addressed their mother, saying, \"We love you, Mom. Stay strong.\"\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the sheriff's office told Business Insider that Nancy's home was \"equipped with several cameras,\" and that detectives are trying to determine what footage is available.\n\nThe FBI is also involved in the investigation.\n\n\"The FBI is doing everything in our power to bring Nancy Guthrie home to her family,\" Jon Edwards, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's office in Tucson, said in a statement at a press conference on Tuesday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump called Guthrie on Wednesday after his interview with NBC News \"to offer words of support for her and her family,\" the White House said in a post on X.\n\n\"I spoke with Savannah Guthrie, and let her know that I am directing ALL Federal Law Enforcement to be at the family's, and Local Law Enforcement's, complete disposal, IMMEDIATELY,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social late Wednesday.\n\n\"We are deploying all resources to get her mother home safely. The prayers of our Nation are with her and her family. GOD BLESS AND PROTECT NANCY!\" Trump wrote.\n\nIn a Wednesday update on X, the sheriff's department said that investigators \"have not identified a suspect or person of interest in this case.\"",

    "description": "\"Recent reporting has created a distraction and has placed a focus on me that is not in the best interests of the firm,\" Karp said in a statement.",
    "fullText": "Brad Karp stepped down as chairman of Big Law firm Paul Weiss on Wednesday amid scrutiny over his ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nScott Barshay was named the new chairman of the global firm, which has more than 1,000 attorneys, \"effective immediately,\" the firm said in a news release.\n\n\"Leading Paul, Weiss for the past 18 years has been the honor of my professional life,\" Karp was quoted as saying in the release. \"Recent reporting has created a distraction and has placed a focus on me that is not in the best interests of the firm.\"\n\nKarp is among the elite names to appear in 3 million documents released by the Justice Department last week from its investigation into Epstein, who killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.\n\nThe latest documents showed that in 2019, Karp reviewed a court filing Epstein was preparing to oppose efforts to reopen his 2008 plea deal with Florida state prosecutors on sex crime charges.\n\n\"The draft motion is in great shape. It's overwhelmingly persuasive. Truly,\" Karp wrote in an email. \"I particularly liked the argument that the 'victims' lied in wait and sat on their rights for their strategic advantage, knowing you were in prison, before they came forward.\"\n\nAt the time, Epstein was in prison, awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. He killed himself in his cell months later.\n\nThe new tranche of files also detailed Karp's email correspondence with Epstein on other matters, from coordinating dinners to discussing legal representation for New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. In other messages, Karp served as an intermediary in matters involving Epstein and former Apollo CEO Leon Black. At one point, Karp also asked Epstein to help his son land a role in a Woody Allen movie.\n\nIn a 2015 email, Karp wrote: \"I can't thank you enough for including me in an evening I'll never forget. It was truly 'once in a lifetime' in every way, though I hope to be invited again. You are an extraordinary host -- and your home....!!! Thanks, again. See you soon.\"\n\nEpstein responded, \"you are always welcome. . there are many many nights of unique talents. you will be invited often.\" And Karp closed the conversation with, \"You're amazing....and thank you!\"\n\nThe Epstein Files haven't been the only source of controversy for Karp. Last year, he came under fire from some for striking an agreement with President Donald Trump under which Paul Weiss pledged $40 million in pro bono legal work in exchange for the president rescinding an executive order targeting the firm.\n\nIn a statement two days before Karp relinquished the chairmanship, Paul Weiss said in a statement, as reported by Reuters, that he met Epstein through Black.\n\n\"During the course of that representation, which spanned several years, Mr. Karp never witnessed or participated in any misconduct,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Mr. Karp attended two group dinners in New York City and had a small number of social interactions by email, all of which he regrets.\"\n\nKarp has been at Paul Weiss for four decades and has been chair of the firm since 2008. Throughout his career, he represented high-profile corporate clients such as Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Bank of America.\n\n\"Mr. Karp will continue to focus his full-time attention to client service at the firm,\" Paul Weiss said in a press release.",

    "description": "Venezuelan official Alex Saab, a former businessman once held in the U.S., was arrested in Venezuela on Wednesday as part of a joint operation between U.S.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Venezuelan official Alex Saab, a former businessman once held in the U.S., was arrested in Venezuela on Wednesday as part of a joint operation between U.S. and Venezuelan ​authorities, a U.S. law enforcement official said.\n\nColombian-born Saab, a close ally of former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, was detained ‌in Cape Verde in 2020 and held in the U.S. for more than three years on bribery charges, before being granted clemency in exchange for the ‌release of Americans held in Venezuela.\n\nColombian newspaper El Espectador later on Wednesday cited a lawyer for Saab, Luigi Giuliano, denying the arrest as \"fake news.\" Journalists aligned with Venezuela's government also denied in social media posts that Saab had been arrested.\n\nSpeaking to Venezuelan news site TalCual, Giuliano added that Saab might make an appearance to confirm this himself but was consulting with the government ⁠about what had happened.\n\nVenezuela's top lawmaker Jorge ‌Rodriguez neither denied nor confirmed the reports in an evening press conference, saying this was not under his remit and he had no information concerning the possible arrest.\n\nGiuliano did not immediately respond ‍to emails sent to addresses listed on a law firm website. A lawyer who represented Saab in U.S. court in December 2023 declined to comment.\n\nSaab, 54, is expected to be extradited to the U.S. in the coming days, the U.S. official said.\n\nThat would represent a ​dramatic development a month after Maduro himself was captured by U.S. forces in Caracas, and would suggest a new ‌level of collaboration between U.S. and Venezuelan law enforcement under the government of interim President Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro's former deputy.\n\nThe U.S. official noted the significance of Rodriguez's cooperation in the joint operation. As interim leader, Rodriguez controls Venezuela's law enforcement agencies and actions.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department and White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nRaul Gorrin, the head of Venezuela's Globovision TV network, was also arrested in the operation, according to the official.\n\nLawyers for Gorrin could not immediately be identified. Globovision ⁠did not respond to a call and email from Reuters.\n\nThe Venezuelan ​communications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBefore his ​2023 clemency, U.S. officials had charged Saab with siphoning around $350 million out of Venezuela through the U.S. as part of a bribery scheme linked to Venezuela's state-controlled exchange rate.\n\nSaab denied the charges and ‍appealed to have them dismissed on ⁠grounds of diplomatic immunity. An appeals court had not ruled on Saab's appeal at the time of the prisoner swap.\n\nHe returned with fanfare to Venezuela at the end of 2023, where Maduro lauded his loyalty to the ⁠country's socialist revolution and feted him as a national hero.\n\nMaduro later made Saab industry minister, a position he held until last month, when he ‌was removed by Rodriguez.",

    "fullText": "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence obtained voting machines from Puerto Rico and probed them for security vulnerabilities, the office said in a statement to CNN Wednesday.\n\nThe extraordinary move comes amid Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard’s broader search for voter fraud at the behest of President Donald Trump, who has falsely claimed that the 2020 election was rigged despite numerous court rulings and audits debunking the claim. Gabbard was present as FBI agents executed a search warrant in Fulton County, Georgia, last week related to the 2020 election.\n\nThe ODNI claimed in its statement to have found “extremely concerning” cybersecurity and operational deployment practices with the voting machines in Puerto Rico but did not provide evidence.\n\nThe US attorney in Puerto Rico, Homeland Security Investigations agents and an FBI supervisory special agent “facilitated the voluntary turnover of electronic voting hardware and software to ODNI for analysis,” an ODNI spokesperson said. It’s unclear exactly when the agency received and studied the voting machines.\n\nIn justifying the voting equipment probe, the ODNI cited “publicly reported claims relating to elections in Puerto Rico alleging discrepancies and systemic anomalies in their electronic voting systems.”\n\nDavid Becker, the executive director of a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that works with election officials, told CNN that voting machines are subject to regular testing and a strict chain of custody. The machines count paper ballots that are audited and recounted to confirm the machine counts. Those are all security controls that have proven effective, he said.\n\nThe director of national intelligence coordinates intelligence from across the 17 other organizations in the US intelligence community. It is unprecedented for the ODNI to play such a hands-on role in election infrastructure, former intelligence officials and election experts told CNN.\n\n“This is well beyond what ODNI has the authority or expertise to do,” a former senior US intelligence official who has worked on election security told CNN Wednesday in reaction to the ODNI statement. “This is amateur hour.”\n\nThe ODNI activity in Puerto Rico “appears intended to intimidate and denigrate election officials, along with the constant threats of prosecutions, and the repeated lies about our election system,” Becker told CNN.\n\nIt was not clear if and when ODNI would release more public information on its probe of voting equipment in Puerto Rico. The agency “is currently coordinating with our partners across the U.S. government to provide the findings from our inquiry to agencies that can take actions to improve the security of our system,” the ODNI spokesperson said.\n\nCNN has requested comment from election officials in Puerto Rico.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk will have to sit for a deposition for lawyers to examine his role in dismantling USAID, a Maryland judge ruled.\n\nIn an eight-page order released on Tuesday, US District Judge Theodore Chuang rejected a request from Musk and officials linked to the Department of Government Efficiency to forgo a deposition.\n\nIt ordered him, along with former acting USAID director Peter Marocco and Department of State official Jeremy Lewin, to be deposed. Musk's legal team had tried to use the \"apex doctrine\" to avoid the deposition, a rule that allows high-ranking government officials to avoid depositions in some situations.\n\nThe deposition is part of a lawsuit against Musk and DOGE officials, filed by current and terminated USAID employees, who remain anonymous.\n\nChuang said that it was unclear whether Musk, Marocco, and Lewin were \"properly deemed to be high-ranking government officials.\"\n\nHe said most of the designated heads of the project were operating in informal or acting roles during the time when USAID was dismantled.\n\nIn the filing, Chuang added that Musk and the other officials failed to provide evidence as to why they chose to shut down the USAID headquarters and website, another reason the deposition was necessary.\n\nThe filing also listed Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Kenneth Jackson, a state department official, and Amy Gleason, a DOGE administrator, as defendants in the case.\n\nUSAID, the US Agency for International Development, distributes foreign aid and supports humanitarian causes globally. It was the top target for Musk-led DOGE at the start of President Donald Trump's second term last January.\n\nUSAID cuts were part of Musk's efforts to slash spending on government agencies that DOGE deemed wasteful. In February last year, USAID officials announced that the agency would cut its staff from 10,000 to just 300, furloughing the rest.\n\nMusk stepped back from DOGE in May.\n\nRepresentatives for Musk, USAID, and the Department of State did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "The biennial Singapore Airshow featured aerobatic stunts from the F-16C, F-35A, Chengdu J-10C, and Su-30MKM.",
    "fullText": "Singapore's biggest aviation event offered a rare treat this year: the chance to see modern fighters used by the world's top three military powers, all tearing through the sky in the span of 90 minutes.\n\nThe biennial Singapore Airshow typically features a flying display, where pilots from around the world showcase aerobatic skills and stunt maneuvers that push their aircraft to the limit.\n\nThis year's performance included the F-16, F-35, Su-30, and J-10C, representing 4.5- and 5-generation aircraft from US, Chinese, and Russian manufacturers.\n\nThese aircraft were flown by the air forces of Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, and China, so the US and Russian militaries were not directly involved in the performance. It also means some of the fighters are modified versions of the original aircraft.\n\nA flying display provides limited insight into the combat performance of these fighters, though it does showcase their capabilities in maneuverability.\n\nStill, recent global tensions have made it increasingly difficult to find a single event that includes flying from all of these combat planes. Here's how their performances compared.\n\nThe People's Liberation Army Air Force sent in their Ba Yi aerobatics team, which flies the Chengdu J-10C.\n\nThe Chinese fighter's C variant is considered equivalent to a 4.5-generation plane, with advanced avionics, some stealth capabilities, and improved maneuverability. More recently, it's been widely reported to have sniped a French-made Rafale with a Chinese long-range munition during last year's India-Pakistan clash.\n\nThe Ba Yi team's six J-10Cs put on a colorful show, pumping red, blue, and yellow dye into their smoke trails as they flew in diamond formations.\n\nOne particularly impressive maneuver had a lead fighter perform a continuous barrel roll around the rest of its team as they flew in formation.\n\nAnother stunt saw a J-10C raise its nose as it slowed to what an announcer said was \"minimum speed,\" gliding through the sky while pouring yellow smoke above the audience.\n\nBut the overall Ba Yi performance felt underwhelming, especially after all the hype around the J-10Cs making their Singapore debut. Chinese state media had emphasized that the fighters arrived after refueling midair — a key capability for any military power seeking to exert global authority.\n\nChinese TV aired an interview with a Ba Yi pilot, who said his team had \"once again crossed mountains and seas\" to reach Singapore. Before the show, flight enthusiasts eagerly shared clips of the J-10Cs practicing.\n\nYet there was little about the Ba Yi team's formations and aileron rolls that set the J-10Cs apart. They were perhaps overshadowed by an earlier performance from Indonesia's Jupiter aerobatics team, which had already showcased formation stunts with South Korean trainer planes.\n\nChina's aviation export corporation is hoping to sell a version of the J-10C, called the J-10CE, to foreign buyers.\n\nThe F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-35 Lightning II, by contrast, screamed into the flying display, charging past us at high power.\n\nThe shock and awe was palpable. A pair of reporters next to me clutched their ears as the fighters' engines sounded like they ripped through the sky.\n\nThe two American fighters appeared separately: Singapore flew an F-16C alongside an AH-64D Apache helicopter, and Australia sent an F-35A.\n\nThe two countries delivered what one would typically expect from the star aircraft. The F-16C and Apache performed several joint maneuvers, releasing flares as they passed by each other. At one point, they appeared to fly just a few feet apart — at least, that's what it looked like from the ground.\n\nThe displays made it clear these planes were built for war. The F-16 performed a dogfighting maneuver called the Falcon Turn, rocketing upward before inverting at full G load to dive back down.\n\nThe Australian F-35A, meanwhile, opened its weapons bay for the audience to see during a flypast. The fifth-generation aircraft is one of the few fighters in the world to house weapons internally.\n\nThe F-35 also made a pass at extreme low speed, making it look like it was floating in the sky.\n\nOnly one Russian-made fighter, a Su-30MKM, flew at the airshow on Tuesday, but it arguably performed the most impressive stunts.\n\nThe Su-30MKM is Malaysia's variant of Russia's Sukhoi-manufactured twin-seat 4.5-generation fighter, and it's one of the few exported versions of the Su-30.\n\nThe Malaysian air force dubbed its display plane \"Toruk Makto,\" after the fictional warrior title from James Cameron's film \"Avatar.\"\n\nThe Su-30MKM executed several showy maneuvers, such as ejecting flares during a flat spin and then in a rapid vertical climb.\n\nThe Malaysian pilots also performed a Cobra, a famous trick in which the aircraft rapidly tilts its nose upward by about 90 degrees to act as an air brake before leveling to continue its flight.\n\nOne other stunt had the Su-30MKM slowly climb upward as it periodically released a ladder of flares.\n\nThe Su-30 has been one of Russia's most frequently used fighters in its war against Ukraine, often kept inside Russian airspace to fire safely into Ukrainian territory. Due to Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, export sales of the aircraft have been limited by wide international sanctions.",

    "fullText": "Pandora, which is known for its iconic silver bracelets, is betting on a different precious metal in 2026 — platinum.\n\nThe Danish jewelry brand will introduce platinum-plated versions of some of its best-selling bracelets this year to reduce its exposure to price-volatile silver, it said in a Wednesday press release.\n\nThe platinum-plated range will extend to its charm selection in the second half of the year, it added.\n\nThe company said in the press release that this decision was made after \"the price of silver and gold has skyrocketed over the past year.\"\n\n\"By introducing platinum-plated products, Pandora will reduce its reliance on sterling silver while continuing to offer consumers high‑quality, desirable jewellery at accessible price points,\" the press release said.\n\nPandora, which was founded in Copenhagen in 1982, now has about 2,400 stores in more than 100 countries, according to its website. Its stock price is down about 63% in the past year.\n\nRepresentatives for Pandora did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nPandora's move \"showcases a business undergoing a significant recalibration of its product offer, customer proposition, and supply chain,\" Jefferies analysts wrote on Wednesday.\n\nThe shift also underscores how jewelry makers are being forced to rethink materials and pricing as precious-metal markets turn increasingly volatile, after a year of historic gains.\n\nPandora is not the only luxury jewelry brand moving away from silver. LVMH executives said in a January earnings call that it is directing Tiffany & Co. to reduce its reliance on silver and move toward gold and fine jewelry.\n\nSilver has been on a blistering rally, with prices surging as much as 70% in January following a roughly 170% jump last year, driven by a combination of tight supply, heavy investment demand, strong industrial use, and speculation.\n\nSpot prices hit a record high above $121 troy ounce last week before crashing as much as 36% on Friday in the white metal's worst single-day drop since 1980.\n\nPrices have since clawed back some losses, but analysts continue to warn that volatility is likely to remain elevated.\n\nSpot silver was trading around $77 per troy ounce at 9:49 p.m. ET on Wednesday, still up about 25% year to date. Spot gold, meanwhile, is around $4,862 per ounce.\n\nPlatinum prices have also climbed sharply alongside silver and gold. The metal rose about 165% last year and is up roughly 8.4% so far this year, reinforcing the cost pressures that jewelry makers face.",

    "fullText": "What stemmed from a 10-day trip to Hong Kong in 2009 to visit my then-boyfriend blossomed into a love story with Asia.\n\nOn my first foray into the East, I landed bright-eyed, eager, and entirely clueless. My welcome meal — a dim sum feast — was a revelation. With my now-husband and 10 of his newest friends, we encircled a table piled with dozens of steamer baskets filled with dimpled sweet buns, flaky taro puffs, braised meats, crispy-bottomed dumplings, and more.\n\nIgnoring my lack of chopsticks experience, I dove in, unsteadily maneuvering a still-steaming bun toward my plate. My finger slipped. And the pastry, in all its custard-filled rotundness, plopped into my teacup, forming a geyser of hot liquid that sprayed those around me.\n\nMortified, I vowed to use chopsticks at every meal until I mastered them. Seventeen years in, it has shaped my sense of self and defined my career as a food journalist.\n\nTraversing epicurean-fueled travels, here are three gastronomic destinations I recommend to fellow travelers, and one I don't, despite the fanfare surrounding it.\n\nFrom bustling street stalls to iconic hole-in-the-wall gems, Thailand's culinary landscape has pulled me in a dozen times over.\n\nBeyond the conventional pad thai and mango sticky rice, there's a deep-rooted legacy of punchy flavors, best washed down with a frothy glass of silky-sweet Thai milk tea.\n\nOne of my most memorable encounters happened by chance, when I ducked into a small storefront to escape a sudden downpour. Distracted by the rain, I almost missed the bubbling stockpot, until the sight of Lung Cheay's signature egg noodles snapped me back to attention. Beloved by those in the know for its dry tom yum, topped with succulent barbecued pork and soft-boiled eggs, the shop is a classic Thai rags-to-riches story. The line that now snakes down the block is worlds away from its humble beginnings as a pushcart.\n\nOther bites I never miss during a visit to Bangkok span melt-in-your-mouth, marinated seafood smothered in a sour and spicy herb sauce at Pa Nee Kung Chae Nam Pla, fried chicken liberally caked in crisped garlic cloves at Polo Fried Chicken, and late-night pilgrimages to Talad Noi Crab Fried Rice overflowing with carb god devotees praying away tomorrow's impending hangover.\n\nI first visited Ho Chi Minh City, or Saigon, in 2017 and returned three more times that year alone. The city reflects historical influences from China, Cambodia, France, and the US, culminating in a distinctly southern-style Vietnamese cuisine that bridges bold flavors, ferments, and fresh herbs.\n\nStreet food forms the backbone of Saigon, with carts feeding the ebb and flow of passersby like blood pumping to the beat of the city's pulsating heart. As evening marches into night, city corners transform into impromptu eateries, with portable tables, plastic stools, and motorbikes abound.\n\nI've done my fair share of devouring in this street-food mecca. There's Bún Thịt Nướng — Nguyễn Trung Trực, a no-frills, 30-year-old stall known for heaping bowls of vermicelli topped with grilled pork, crisp egg rolls, pickles, and a bouquet of herbs.\n\nThen there's Bún Cá Xe Dẩy, a late-night vendor ladling steaming bowls of canh chua — a tangy pineapple, tamarind, and tomato soup laced with fried fish. And at Xíu Mại chén Đèn Dầu, springy Vietnamese-style meatballs are served in a fragrant broth, with a crusty baguette on the side for dipping.\n\nRegardless of how many times I visit, there's always another miniature plastic chair flanking a buzzing back-alley pop-up waiting for me to take a seat.\n\nMost famous for turning the spice dial up to an 11 through Sichuan peppercorn flakes that vibrate against your lips long after the meal concludes and seemingly innocuous bites that still register on the Scoville scale, eating in Chengdu is an all-out heat offensive.\n\nIt's also my go-to for Chinese culinary travel.\n\nWhile wontons are ubiquitous within China, only in Chengdu will you find hongyou chaoshou (red oil wontons). Coated in chile oil, these crescent-shaped pockets of joy are omnipresent, each spot tweaking the recipe ever-so-slightly to cause a ripple in the die-hard fandom of one wonton shop over the next.\n\nWarming bowls of wontons sprinkled with friendly shopkeeper chitchat earmark my annual pilgrimages to China's spice capital.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, tianshuimian (sweet water noodles) spotlight Sichuan's signature guaiwei, or \"strange flavor\" — a seasoning that folds spicy, salty, sesame, sour, and sweet into a single bite. Cord-like, al dente noodles are swaddled in dark and light soy sauce, chile oil, sesame and garlic pastes, crushed peanuts, Sichuan peppercorns, and brown sugar syrup, forming a gravy that varnishes each strand with an addictive, lip-tingling heat.\n\nSitting with a brimming bowlful of bland noodles in Tokyo, I've been left with frustration rather than fulfillment more times than I care to recount. Japan, as a whole, struggles with excess hype and over-tourism resulting from a fetishization of its culture.\n\nIt's in vogue to collect kawaii memorabilia, swap coffee for matcha, and recount every Miyazaki movie ever made. I even have an anime bowl of ramen tattooed on my arm. (Zero regrets)\n\nTokyo is the epicenter of that trendiness.\n\nOften miscast as the pinnacle of Japanese cuisine, Tokyo tempts visitors, myself included, into chasing viral ramen shops, jiggly pancake cafés, and so-called must-visit markets — places popularized by social media, complete with long waits and inflated prices that rarely justify the hype.\n\nWhile this dynamic exists in many international cities, I find it far more blatant in Tokyo.\n\nThis is in no way a dig at Japanese food; it's one of my favorite cuisines. From thick fillets of bonito seared over dried straw flames in Kochi Prefecture to bubbling streetside vats of oden in Osaka —daikon, tofu, and fish cakes simmered in an aromatic broth — my travels across Japan have almost always left me deeply satisfied.\n\nBut in Tokyo, specifically, I often struggle as an outsider to distinguish between what's genuinely great and what's merely hyped.\n\nStill, with Tokyo as my neighbor, there's always room for a new chapter in my Asian food love saga.",

    "fullText": "Miranda Kerr, 42, says choosing forgiveness helped her co-parent peacefully with her ex, Orlando Bloom.\n\nOn Tuesday's episode of the \"We Need To Talk\" podcast, the former Victoria's Secret Angel spoke about the dynamics of her relationship with Bloom, whom she was married to from 2010 to 2013.\n\n\"I think because from day one, Orlando and I had done a lot of spiritual work, and forgiveness was a big part of that. Forgiving each other, forgiving ourselves, creating peace within the situation,\" Kerr told podcast host Paul C. Brunson.\n\nThe model said she and Bloom recognized their relationship \"was not bringing out the best in each other.\" When they eventually separated, she said they agreed to put their son, Flynn, first.\n\n\"Let's not make it about us. Let's make it about what's in the best interest for Flynn. But at the same time, let's make sure that we completely forgive each other, make peace with each other, because otherwise it really weighs on you,\" Kerr said.\n\nHaving \"animosity\" toward someone because \"they didn't live up to your expectations\" can be exhausting, especially when that person will still remain in her life, she said.\n\nKerr said she and Bloom chose to forgive each other and stay peaceful so they could maintain a \"harmonious\" co-parenting relationship.\n\n\"When you have a child with someone else, they're always going to be that person's parent for the rest of their life. There are going to be situations where you're going to need to talk if you like it or not. So why not make it harmonious?\" Kerr said.\n\nOn the podcast, Kerr also spoke about her relationship with her husband, Snapchat cofounder Evan Spiegel, whom she married in 2017.\n\nShe said Spiegel, who is also a child of divorce, didn't want her son Flynn \"to ever feel any of this stuff that he felt.\"\n\n\"And so he makes an effort to be peaceful and to be kind, and he knows that I love him and he knows that he's the man for me,\" Kerr said.\n\nIn fact, Kerr said that Spiegel helped her set better boundaries with Bloom.\n\n\"In the beginning, when Orlando and I had recently separated, I was just very, very giving, as always, and wanting to please. And if Orlando had a last-minute change — and he would say this himself — I would always accommodate him to that,\" Kerr said.\n\nShe added that her husband encouraged her not to be afraid to say no.\n\n\"He's like, you know, you don't have to. So you can be clear and merry and say, 'I'm so sorry that your plans changed, but we planned according to this,'\" Kerr said, recalling Speigel's words.\n\nKerr isn't alone. Other celebrities have also opened up about how they navigate co-parenting after splitting from their exes.\n\nKristin Cavallari told Business Insider in 2020 that she was focused on putting her kids first amid her split from ex-husband Jay Cutler.\n\n\"They're the only things I care about right now,\" she said. \"And so I'm removing any of my emotions or feelings and just thinking about them and putting them first.\"\n\nIn a 2022 podcast appearance, Kim Kardashian spoke about the challenges of co-parenting with Ye, formerly known as Kanye West. The reality TV star said she protects her ex-husband in the \"eyes of my kids, for my kids.\"\n\n\"One day my kids will thank me for not sitting here and bashing their dad when I could,\" Kardashian said.",

    "description": "OpenClaw is gaining ground in China as major tech firms add support and users flock to the viral AI agent.",
    "fullText": "The viral AI agent OpenClaw — formerly known as Clawdbot, then Moltbot — has found an audience in China.\n\nSince last week, Chinese tech companies including Tencent, Alibaba, and Volcano Engine, a cloud service platform under ByteDance, have begun integrating OpenClaw into their platforms, making it easier for Chinese users to run the agent. That includes connecting the agent to workplace tools such as Alibaba's collaboration platform, DingTalk, and Tencent Holdings' WeCom, the work version of China's super app, WeChat.\n\nOpenClaw began circulating widely in tech circles last month, attracting high-profile fans including Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan and multiple partners at Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nThe agent has also taken off among Chinese users, with demos, tutorials, and use cases spreading rapidly across local social platforms.\n\nOpenClaw is designed to run around the clock and plug into a wide range of consumer apps, allowing users to automate tasks such as managing schedules, overseeing vibe-coding sessions, or even building AI employees.\n\nIn a post on Tencent Cloud's developer platform, the company said last Thursday that its servers have rolled out a preconfigured OpenClaw application template, enabling users to deploy the AI assistant in the cloud with minimal setup.\n\nAlibaba Cloud has also rolled out support for OpenClaw on its platforms and said the agent can connect to a range of models from Alibaba's Qwen series.\n\nVolcano Engine, ByteDance's cloud services arm, outlined how developers can deploy Moltbot in its environment in an article published on Monday, while also flagging key safety considerations.\n\n\"Because the tool has extensive data, account, and network access permissions, please deploy it in a dedicated environment, avoid handling sensitive information, and be sure to review permissions regularly and set access restrictions for ECS and API keys,\" the article said, referring to cloud servers and access credentials.\n\nFor OpenClaw to run as a digital assistant across apps, it requires access to users' files, login details, browser activity, and other data.\n\nCybersecurity specialists told Business Insider in a report published on Wednesday that agents like OpenClaw can be vulnerable to \"prompt injections,\" a tactic that uses hidden instructions to trick AI into performing actions such as leaking data or publishing content on users' behalf.\n\nDespite mounting privacy and security concerns, enthusiasm for the agent among Chinese users shows little sign of slowing.\n\nPosts and demos featuring OpenClaw have surged on the Chinese social media platform RedNote.\n\nOne RedNote user who goes by \"Brother C\" posted a video tutorial last Tuesday, walking viewers through how to use OpenClaw. \"See how the 24/7 proactive AI assistant is revolutionizing workflows,\" he wrote. The post drew more than 4,000 likes and was saved over 6,000 times.\n\nAnother user posting under the nickname \"Teacher Du\" shared his own explainer on Monday, describing how OpenClaw could be deployed in everyday workflows. His post was saved more than 2,000 times and received over 1,000 likes.\n\n\"My experience was truly mind-blowing,\" he wrote, adding that the agent could handle \"all sorts of tasks\" and that the \"concept of a true AI employee is getting closer.\"\n\nLike their counterparts in the US, Chinese users are buying Mac Minis to run the agent. A RedNote user named Wu Bin said he had ordered a secondhand Mac Mini to serve as his \"super assistant.\"\n\n\"It's incredibly convenient, I can control it remotely to organize files and handle all sorts of tasks,\" he wrote.\n\nNot everyone is convinced. A user who goes by \"Programmer Yago\" warned in a RedNote post on Sunday that using the agent could leave users' data \"running naked all over the internet.\"\n\nOpenClaw did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "Innovation can be hard when you've been around a while, but instilling these two values in employees can help, says Alibaba's cofounder and chairman.\n\n\"We've gone through periods where we stopped innovating, and we suffer from it as a large company,\" Joe Tsai said in an interview at Stanford University released on Wednesday. \"Everybody has their role. It's very difficult to get people to think about new things about the future, innovate.\"\n\nCreating a separate innovation division is not the solution, said Tsai, who joined the Chinese e-commerce firm in 1999 as a member of the founding team.\n\n\"I think the one thing that you need to do is to instill in people some sense of ownership,\" he said.\n\n\"They're not just working for their boss. Everybody should work for their customers,\" he added, referring to a saying by Jack Ma, the company's former CEO.\n\nThe idea is to care about making customers, not bosses, happy and start thinking about what customers will want in the future, Tsai said.\n\nAnother trait necessary for innovation is being agile. That matters, particularly in the technology business, where there is always a \"deficiency of information.\"\n\n\"You'd have to be able to tolerate not having full information and then just making a decision and committing to it,\" he said. \"Then if you find out you're wrong, pivot fast in a different direction.\"\n\nThe tech giant has staged a significant comeback in the last two years, driven by AI innovation and the restructuring of its e-commerce business.\n\nIn an earnings call late last year, Alibaba's CEO, Eddie Wu, dismissed talk of an AI bubble and said he's going all in on spending on the technology.\n\n\"We're not even able to keep pace with the growth in customer demand,\" Wu said, adding that in the next three years to come, AI resources will continue to be in short supply.\n\nWu said that the surge in demand isn't coming from hype but from real-world AI adoption across the economy.\n\nThe company's Qwen AI models compete with its global counterparts on benchmark tests.",

    "fullText": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google’s latest quarterly report provided further evidence that its internet empire is withstanding an artificial intelligence shakeup that’s turning into another potential boon for the company.\n\nThe numbers released Wednesday marked Google's third consecutive quarter of digital ad growth of more than 10% from the previous year, while also posting more than 30% sales growth in its division that powers data centers for AI services.\n\nWhat drove Google's strong Q4 financial performance?\n\nWhat impact did the antitrust ruling have?\n\nHow is Google competing against AI startups?\n\nHow much is Alphabet investing in AI infrastructure?\n\nThose increases during the October-December period propelled Google’s corporate parent Alphabet Inc. well past the earnings forecasts of stock market analysts.\n\nAlphabet’s fourth-quarter profit rose 30% from the prior year to $34.5 billion, or $2.82 per share, while revenue climbed 18% to $113.8 billion.\n\nThe collective momentum of Google’s main business in search and advertising and the still-nascent AI field indicates a company born during the late 1990s internet boom is becoming even stronger during another technology phenomenon nearly 30 years later.\n\n“Search saw more usage than ever before, with AI continuing to drive an expansionary moment,\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said.\n\nGoogle’s successful evolution has helped drive up Alphabet’s stock price nearly 60% in the past five months, giving it a $4 trillion market value. Even so, some investors are still skeptical whether Google will be able to sustain enough growth to justify the more than $300 billion that Alphabet will have spent from 2024 through the end of this year on expanding the computing capacity needed for AI features. Those worries caused Alphabet's shares to see-saw between slight gains and declines during extended trading after Wednesday's report came out.\n\nApple, also currently worth $4 trillion, thinks so highly of Google’s AI that the iPhone maker recently struck a deal to use Google’s Gemini technology in a long-delayed upgrade to its virtual assistant, Siri.\n\nGoogle is also embedding more of its Gemini AI into its long-dominant search engine, Gmail and Chrome browser as it tries to avoid complacency and being outmaneuvered by up-and-coming companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Perplexity.\n\nTo meet the challenge, Alphabet has been on a spending spree to expand its AI capacity. After pouring $91 billion into capital expenditures devoted mostly to AI, the Mountain View, California, company disclosed Wednesday that it expects to double down by spending another $175 billion to $185 billion this year. Its capital expenditure budget has ballooned from about $30 billion annually since 2022 when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot to much acclaim, prompting Google to pull out all the stops to catch up.",

    "description": "A federal judge was skeptical of President Donald Trump’s argument to try to move the appeal of his hush money conviction to federal court — after lawyers already took their shot in two other courts.",
    "fullText": "A federal judge was skeptical of President Donald Trump’s argument to try to move the appeal of his hush money conviction to federal court — after lawyers already took their shot in two other courts.\n\nJudge Alvin Hellerstein suggested Trump’s attorneys missed their chance by first taking the US Supreme Court’s decision on presidential immunity to the state court judge who oversaw the criminal trial and not to a federal judge until almost two months later.\n\n“You made a choice. You sought two bites at the apple,” Hellerstein told Trump’s lawyers Wednesday.\n\nHe also quizzed Trump’s lawyer over the argument that the case should move to federal court because Trump could claim as a defense that he has immunity. Calling the arguments “provocative,” he said he would issue a ruling later.\n\nTrump’s attorneys are trying to get the appeal of his hush money conviction moved into federal court where the judges could interpret challenges involving federal preemption and presidential immunity. Removal would also plow a quicker path to have the appeal heard by the US Supreme Court.\n\nTrump was convicted in 2024 of 34 state charges of falsifying business records in connection with hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nDuring oral arguments on Wednesday, Hellerstein said Trump’s attorneys appeared to make a strategic decision to bring the Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity first to Judge Juan Merchan, the state judge who oversaw the trial, before trying to move the case to federal court which it did 58 days after the decision came down.\n\nJeffrey Wall, an attorney for Trump, pushed back against Hellerstein’s comment that he was trying to get another bite at the apple.\n\n“It would have been disrespectful in spades” to Judge Merchan if they bypassed him, Wall said. He said they had to move quickly before the state judge because Trump was set to be sentenced by him 10 days later.\n\nHellerstein said Trump’s attorneys missed the 30-day window allowed under the statute to move the case into federal court and their burden now was whether there was “good cause” to allow them to try again.\n\n“All your doing is saying your good cause is you’re afraid to anger the state court and you want to give the state court the first chance” to rule on the Supreme Court decision before trying the argument in federal court, the judge said.\n\n“You’ve made a strategic decision. You’re seeing where you can get a better decision and that is indicative of the intent,” the judge said.\n\n“My thesis is that was fatal to you,” Hellerstein said.\n\nTrump is simultaneously appealing his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records to influence the 2016 presidential election in state court. That appeal can ultimately be brought to the US Supreme Court but it has additional layers of review.\n\nHellerstein had previously rejected Trump’s effort to move the case into federal court, finding the argument that Trump had presidential immunity didn’t apply. Trump later tried again after the Supreme Court’s ruling on presidential immunity. He argued the use of evidence, including testimony from Trump’s former White House advisor Hope Hicks and his tweets while in office, were improperly used and his conviction should be overturned.\n\nAt the time Hellerstein denied that motion for removal, writing, “Private schemes with private actors, unconnected to any statutory or constitutional authority or function of the executive, are considered unofficial acts.”\n\nTrump appealed and in November the Second Circuit Court of Appeals sent it back to Hellerstein to conduct further analysis considering the Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity.\n\nOn Wednesday, Wall, the attorney for Trump, argued when the Manhattan district attorney’s office introduced evidence of what they argued were official acts — such as Trump’s tweets, trial testimony from his former White House aide Hope Hicks, and testimony about conversations Trump had with his attorney general — it changed the case and now it should be moved into federal court.\n\n“The district attorney held those keys in his hand. He didn’t have to introduce that evidence at trial to prove up his case. Once he did this became a prosecution relating to those official acts,” Wall argued.\n\n“Is that enough to make it a federal case? I think the answer to that is obviously yes,” Wall said.\n\nThe attorney added, “I don’t think you have to get to the bottom of this. It’s all for the Second Circuit.”\n\nWall said that the judge doesn’t have to decide the merits of the argument on immunity, only that they have what is called a “colorable defense” to move the case into federal court.\n\nSteven Wu, an attorney for the district attorney’s office, argued that a fight over evidence is not a defense to criminal charges.\n\n“The defendant seems to assume that because evidence of official acts is introduced that somehow transforms the nature of the criminal action. That’s just not true. The charges arise out of conduct that is wholly unofficial and private,” Wu said.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s argument, while the judge was skeptical of many of Trump’s legal arguments, he acknowledged a technical maneuver that appealed to him.\n\n“That’s a delicious thought because I then dump the whole problem on the Court of Appeals,” Hellerstein said.",

    "description": "Joan...",
    "fullText": "This is one of many signs that Trump knows his party is in big trouble in the coming midterm elections.\n\nThe Department of Justice’s seizure of Fulton County, Georgia, 2020 voting records remains a chilling, bewildering exercise in using federal agencies to try to validate Donald Trump’s false claim that he won reelection that year, carrying Georgia though even state GOP officials certified that he lost the state by more than 11,000 votes. Trump followed up the FBI raid by insisting, during a podcast interview with former deputy FBI director Dan Bongino, that “Republicans” should “take over” voting procedures in 15 states. “The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over,’” he said. “We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many—15 states. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting.” Any attempt to “nationalize” voting processes would be unconstitutional; it’s clearly the purview of the states. But note that Trump specifically said one party, his own, should take over. That’s just about as fascist as he’s ever sounded.\n\nWhile spokesperson Karoline Leavitt tried to claim that Trump was only referring to the SAVE Act, which would force Americans to prove their citizenship to register to vote, the president himself continued to insist he intended much more than that. Standing in front of a cadre of Republican lawmakers assembled as he signed legislation ending a brief government shutdown, he announced, “I want to see elections be honest, and if a state can’t run an election, I think the people behind me should do something about it.”\n\nThis is one of many signs that Trump knows his party is in big trouble in the coming midterm elections. Remarkably, many GOP leaders said they disagreed with Trump’s suggestion that Republicans take over elections. “I’m not in favor of federalizing elections,” Senate majority leader John Thune told reporters. “That’s not what the Constitution says about elections,” Senator Rand Paul told MS Now.\n\nWhile Trump lackey House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed doubt that his party could take over elections, he did echo the president’s continued false claims about Democratic voter fraud. “We had three House Republican candidates who were ahead on Election Day in the last election cycle, and every time a new tranche of ballots came in they just magically whittled away until their leads were lost,” Johnson told reporters. “It looks on its face to be fraudulent. Can I prove that? No.”\n\nThat’s right, Mike. You can’t prove it, because it isn’t true.\n\nStill, there’s no doubt Trump is so worried about the midterms that he is looking for ways to manipulate the process (rather than abandon the cruel policies that are making Republicans so unpopular). Trump has suggested cancelling the midterms altogether. He has proposed banning mail-in voting entirely, and decertifying voting equipment he doesn’t trust, believing a smaller, more constrained electorate will skew Republican. The administration has sued states, including Minnesota, to get access to voter rolls. Just yesterday, Steve Bannon said on his War Room podcast, “We‘re gonna have ICE surround the polls.… We’ll never again allow an election to be stolen.”\n\nSteve Bannon: “We‘re gonna have ICE surround the polls…We’ll never again allow an election to be stolen.” pic.twitter.com/9R9tZdolHx\n\nTrump has also looked for ways to take custody of ballots and voting records away from local election officials. Democracy Docket founder and voting rights attorney Mark Elias believes last week’s seizure of Fulton County ballots “was in part a dry run to work out the logistics of how this could happen in the future.”\n\nWe still don’t know exactly what led to the Georgia ballot seizure, or why Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was part of it (she seems to have been quietly sidelined from genuine intelligence concerns). There are reports that a grand jury is investigating the Fulton County election process, and Trump predicted in Davos, “People will soon be prosecuted for what they did.” Even stranger was the news that Trump talked to Gabbard after the raid, and used her phone to address the agents who carried out the seizure and thank them for their work.\n\nOn one level, the Fulton County exercise may be meaningless, because the 2020 results were certified and President Joe Biden served his term. But if the Department of Justice can find a basis (however flimsy) to seize ballots five years later, it’s not clear what would stop them from seizing ballots immediately after an election. Elias says the strange show of force in Georgia should make Democrats take Trump “seriously and literally” about his plans to impede voting in upcoming elections. CNN reports that Democratic election officials are planning for potential federal interference in the midterms, including the use of ICE and other agencies to intimidate voters.\n\nOn the other hand, some people (including me, occasionally) worry that overstating the threat of GOP interference could lead some Democrats, especially alienated, infrequent voters, to throw up their hands and assume the fix is in. Discouraging Democratic voters is very much part of the GOP’s voter suppression playbook. But Trump’s increasingly bold, shrill comments about making sure the GOP wins upcoming elections serve to send a signal to his true believers that every idea, no matter how crazy-sounding, is welcome, given the party’s dire political straits. We can’t afford to tune him out.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "description": "Chris...",
    "fullText": "It turns out that democracy doesn’t die in darkness at all—it succumbs to repeated group muggings at the hands of the moneyed power elite.\n\nFor the past week, I’ve been unable to retrieve the copies of The Washington Post that usually get delivered to my home, since the brutal weather in the DC area has turned my front yard into an unfordable moat of frozen snow. This now seems a richly prophetic turn of events, since my hometown newspaper is being eviscerated under the disastrous ownership of centibillionaire monopolist and MAGA flunky Jeff Bezos.\n\nPer a new report from The New York Times—cowritten by former Post media columnist Erik Wemple—the paper is initiating “a widespread round of layoffs.” Other outlets reported that at least a third of Post employees across business and editorial are being let go. In a Zoom call with the paper’s staff—one that neither Bezos nor his handpicked Post publisher Will Lewis deigned to attend—editor in chief Matt Murray announced that the Post’s sports section—a distinguished operation that formerly anchored a great deal of the paper’s market penetration in the mid-Atlantic—will be effectively dismantled, with a handful of staffers left to stoke a walking-dead version of it. Local news coverage—another historic strength of the paper, and one of the few coverage areas that cannot be easily replicated by other national titles—is also being gutted. The Post will also be shuttering its recently revived books section—where I worked as deputy editor in the early aughts. The paper’s daily news podcast will be deep-sixed, and its international desk is due to be hollowed out.\n\nNews of this impending bloodletting has been swirling around industry circles for weeks—so much so that foreign correspondents for the Post were reduced last week to publicly begging Bezos to save their jobs, and preserve the Post’s reputation as a serious news organization. Their pleas fell on deaf ears. Bezos didn’t bother to reply and kept an arrogant oligarchic silence during the buildup to this gruesome journalistic dismemberment. Bezos also offered no comment when Post reporter Hannah Natanson had her devices seized by the FBI in the investigation of a series of leaks from a government contractor—an act of intimidation from a Trump White House waging sustained ideological war on the fourth estate. Bezos’s silence on these fundamental assaults on news-gathering underscores his complacent indifference to the civic value of journalism; his true priorities became clear amid the Post’s death watch when he stirred out of his state of public hibernation long enough to host Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth—who has overseen the complete ideological purging of the Pentagon press corps—at his space start-up Blue Origin, which holds billions of dollars in defense contracts.\n\nBezos’s aloof posture isn’t so much a study in plutocratic reticence as the savvy impulse of a mobster determined not to return to a crime scene. The Amazon overlord was hailed as the paper’s savior when he purchased it from the Graham family in 2013. His takeover of the Post was part of a wave of tech-bro splurges in the legacy media market, including Facebook executive Chris Hughes’s ill-fated acquisition of The New Republic, and eBay cofounder Pierre Omidyar’s launch of First Look Media, whose signature outlet The Intercept is now in dire financial straits. Bezos’s acquisition of the Post stood out in this field, both because of the paper’s stature and because of his limitless resources. Surely, the thinking went, with this level of financial backing, the paper could reverse its declining circulation and jury-rig some sort of viable business model for daily journalism in the 21st century.\n\nThis scenario seemed plausible for a while, after Donald Trump was first elected president in 2016. The Post was able to reap a major surge in digital subscriptions by leaning into its image as a Trump-baiting organ of the resistance; its new Bezos-era slogan, crafted by Watergate veteran Bob Woodward, “Democracy Dies in Darkness,” neatly distilled this marketing agenda.\n\nBut as the mogul-heavy history of modern journalism shows in stomach-churning detail, news organizations that live by oligarchic support often die by it as well. In reality, the Post under Bezos’s watch was already embarking on myopic and counter-journalistic bids to goose revenues and harvest eyeballs via management-driven plans to bulk up its news-aggregation operations, while launching a wage-soaking freelance initiative dubbed “the Talent Network.” This latter operation, in the rapt telling of Marty Baron, the Post’s editor in chief during the Bezos honeymoon, served as “ the journalistic version of TaskRabbit (freelance labor for everyday tasks) and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (a crowd-sourcing site for on-demand business tasks)…. Overnight, it dramatically expanded the journalistic reach of the Post at a bargain-basement price.”\n\nThe sugar highs of all this digital gimmickry proved short-lived, especially after Bezos, ever attuned to the main chance for piling up more billions, joined the rest of the Silicon Valley power elite in aligning behind Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. Bezos vetoed the Post’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris, triggering the departure of the paper’s op-ed chief, David Shipley, and hundreds of thousands of canceled subscriptions from outraged readers. He then issued a new dictum for the paper’s opinion shop, ordering that it be devoted to the promotion of “free markets” and “personal liberties”—both long-standing items in the catechism of cosmically wealthy moguls courting public worship. The section has since become an unsightly congeries of glorified press releases from the Cato Institute—together with editorial board fantasias on the heroic leadership of Trump that read like they’d be a stretch for Pravda to pull off. In the wake of the exodus of its entire roster of accomplished liberal columnists, the section’s furthest-left regular contributor is arguably the Tory-Reaganite Never Trumper George Will.\n\nThis concerted ideological defacing of the Post, quite plainly, is at the heart of the paper’s most recent financial plight. But the logic of mogul newsroom dominance forbids Post management from squarely acknowledging this fact—or at least saying it aloud. So in a fraught 2024 newsroom meeting, publisher Will Lewis extended the great managerial tradition of blaming workers for the colossal fuckups of their bosses. “We are losing large amounts of money,” he proclaimed. “Your audience has halved in recent years. People are not reading your stuff.”\n\nAs any competent editor will tell you, Lewis’s use of the passive voice is telling. Audiences don’t halve themselves in a vacuum; the responsible parties were Bezos and his handpicked adjutant Lewis—an eager tabloid handmaiden for clownish and disgraced former British prime minister Boris Johnson, when he wasn’t running interference in the UK Telegraph’s phone-hacking scandal. It turns out that democracy doesn’t die in darkness at all—it succumbs to repeated group muggings at the hands of the moneyed power elite. But that’s a story you’re never going to read in Jeff Bezos’s Washington Post.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "fullText": "SANTA CLARA, California  — “I’m gonna fight and die to protect them with everything I’ve got.\"\n\nThat's what Will Campbell said last April after he was drafted by the New England Patriots with the fourth overall pick. And with that, he quickly endeared himself to fans, showing that he was willing to do whatever it takes to protect Drake Maye.\n\nCampbell has done an impressive job all season, despite a few bumps and bruises along the way, including a short stint on injured reserve. So, with only one game remaining this season, the starting left tackle reflected on these comments and how that signified the start of a close bond between him and Maye.\n\n\"I had a lot of emotions running through me that night. I was excited,\" he recalled. \"One of the reasons I wanted to come here was to block for him. So it's been awesome, not only being here, but getting to know him, building a relationship with him.\"\n\nAnd with that, Maye has been able to help Campbell with the hard transition to the NFL, having just gone through it himself one year prior.\n\n\"It's been awesome. He was in the same position as me last year, a long way from home, living by himself,\" Campbell explained. \"And him and his wife have been very welcoming to me and my family. His family's awesome. So I'm just super thankful for him.\"\n\nSo, does the saying still ring true?\n\nFollow Patriots Wire on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Patriots Wire: Will Campbell reflects on viral draft night quote ahead of Super Bowl",

    "title": "5 Of The World's Worst F1 Courses (According To Racing Fans)",
    "description": "F1 travels the world, yet some venues draw criticism for dull races and awkward layouts. Fans weigh in on the circuits that frustrate drivers and viewers.",
    "fullText": "Very few sports generate as much thrill as Formula 1. Seeing the fastest drivers in the fastest cars in the world going flat out for what's now 24 weekends a year remains arguably the greatest spectacle in all of motorsport, but there are a few important factors that determine whether that's achieved on a regular basis. The biggest talking point for modern F1 is that the cars themselves aren't great for wheel-to-wheel racing, which is certainly a fair argument. The new regulations are designed to help promote close action, so hopefully we won't need to have that discussion as often going forward.\n\nEqually as important for generating competitive racing, though, are the tracks that they race on. As mentioned, F1 races at 24 different locations, with a wide variety of track styles present on the calendar. Before the season even starts, there are a few circuits that fans look forward to, for example, Silverstone and Interlagos. However, F1 has to follow the biggest and longest contracts to decide which tracks to race on, which aren't always best suited for the pinnacle of open-wheel racing. Fans of the sport don't hold back on their views of some of these circuits, and based on posts online, there's consistency regarding which ones are the most disliked. Looking at the wide array of posts on forum sites such as Reddit, here's a look at five tracks that are often a talking point for all the wrong reasons.\n\nEven if NASCAR has remained at the top of American motorsport, Formula One has long had a presence in the U.S., hosting races at iconic tracks such as Indianapolis, as well as various street circuits like Dallas, Detroit, and, most recently, Las Vegas. While the Circuit of the Americas in Austin has been on the calendar since 2012, Vegas was introduced in response to the recent surge in popularity of the pinnacle of open-wheel racing. A year earlier, the Miami International Autodrome was constructed around Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nAs one of the hybrid street-style circuits, Miami incorporates quite a few different elements from established tracks, with Sector 1 full of sweeping fast turns, followed by a long back straight before the incredibly tight beginning of Sector 3. It might sound good, but the layout is restricted by the stadium grounds to a significant degree. Compared to the tracks it takes inspiration from, many fans feel that it's terrible for actual racing, with the flow constantly being interrupted. Reddit users go as far as to say the Miami Autodrome is \"utterly soulless.\"\n\nThe Lusail International Circuit is one of the more unique venues for F1 at the moment, albeit for a different reason than any other track. First used in 2004, the Qatar track was designed for MotoGP. Of course, MotoGP bikes are massively different to control than an F1 car, with next to no downforce and an emphasis on rider balance and corner exits. As a result, the track features a variety of corners that are long and swooping on a MotoGP bike, promoting great side-by-side action. But for F1, the cars go through these sections so fast that it's a challenge to remain close to the car in front.\n\nIn DestinationFormula1's collection of fan feedback, this was a big issue that fans had with the Lusail circuit. Hopefully, the upcoming 2026 regulations can help solve this by reducing the dirty air given off by cars, but we'll have to wait and see. Similar to Miami, users on Reddit use the word \"soulless\" again to describe the track, but with MotoGP often providing thrilling action here, it just doesn't seem to be as well suited for four-wheeled cars.\n\nThe second Middle Eastern track featured here, the Yas Marina Circuit, has hosted the final race of the season since 2010 and has been on the calendar since 2009. Over the years, we've been treated to some thrilling title deciders at the Abu Dhabi track, many of which have been some of the most memorable races of those seasons. However, it's not necessarily the track itself that generates the excitement, with fans often finding races at Yas Marina to be lackluster when there's nothing at stake.\n\nFor the 2021 season, changes were made to the circuit in a bid to improve racing, namely the removal of two of the stop-start chicanes in Sectors 1 and 2 that some fans felt completely ruined the flow of the circuit. But still, the main overtaking zones remain the two long straights, which start after two corners that modern F1 cars struggle to follow closely through. Outside of the racing itself, other fans are also critical of the track because of the lack of atmosphere. The Abu Dhabi GP is very much intended to be a spectacle, but it doesn't exactly match the feel you get at Monza, Silverstone, or Zandvoort, for example.\n\nWhile other tracks on this list have been added to the sport quite recently, the calendar is also packed with venues that have essentially become staples of F1. Some of these tracks are ones that fans believe shouldn't ever be taken out, and the same can be said for all of them. The Spanish Grand Prix has taken place at the Circuit De Barcelona Catalunya ever since its introduction in 1991, and it instantly made a great impression with Senna and Mansell going wheel to wheel down the main straight. As F1 has developed over the years to become faster and faster, though, the track hasn't managed to keep up.\n\nCircuit De Barcelona Catalunya has just about every corner type you could have on a modern circuit, which makes it no surprise that it's used extensively for testing. But for actual racing, the never-ending flow of corners creates what one Reddit user calls \"stalemate racing.\" The removal of the final chicane has allowed cars to follow better down the straight, but in general, that's a pretty fair description. This is another track that'll hopefully reap the benefits of the smaller cars in 2026.\n\nAnd now for, without a doubt, the most controversial track in Formula 1, Circuit de Monaco. The Monte Carlo street track is one of four current tracks that were used for the inaugural season back in 1950, alongside Silverstone, Spa-Francorchamps, and Monza. Due to this, the history that Monaco holds for F1 can't be denied. But because of how big F1 cars are now, the opportunities for overtaking are virtually non-existent. It's been like this for decades, though, with Mansell finding no way past Senna despite having much fresher tires in 1992.\n\nQualifying has always been Monaco's moment to shine. The constant risk of crashing makes it a thrilling watch, and drivers such as Fernando Alonso call it \"one of the best moments of the season\" when speaking to ESPN. On race day, though, fans think the street circuit is simply \"not suited for modern racing,\" as one Reddit user puts it. For the 2025 race, two pit stops were made mandatory, but all that did was make drivers back each other up to open a pit window for their teammates. The heritage, combined with the challenge, makes it one of the races that drivers want to win more than most, but from the outside, the heritage is the only thing that keeps it on the calendar.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "description": "The Detroit Tigers lost one of their most enduring symbols of toughness and dependability with the passing of Mickey Lolich, a pitcher whose career embodied an era when durability, competitiveness, and responsibility defined greatness.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Tigers lost one of their most enduring symbols of toughness and dependability with the passing of Mickey Lolich, a pitcher whose career embodied an era when durability, competitiveness, and responsibility defined greatness.\n\nLolich was never flashy. He didn’t rely on mystique or velocity spikes or modern metrics to carve out his place in baseball history. Instead, he showed up—again and again — and took the ball for Detroit, often more than anyone else in the league. In a franchise rich with Hall of Famers and iconic figures, Lolich’s legacy rests on something more elemental: trust. When the Tigers needed innings, wins, or stability, Lolich was there.\n\nSigned by Detroit out of high school in Oregon, Lolich debuted in 1963 and spent the heart of his prime anchoring Tigers rotations through the 1960s and early 1970s. Those years were not easy ones to pitch in. Offense surged across baseball, workloads were heavy, and pitchers were expected to finish what they started. Lolich didn’t just survive in that environment; he thrived.\n\nFrom 1964 through 1975, Lolich was one of the most durable starters in the American League. He routinely led the league in games started, innings pitched, and strikeouts, posting season after season of 40-plus starts at a time when pitching every fourth day was standard. His calling card was a heavy fastball and a devastating curveball, a combination that allowed him to rack up strikeouts while still working deep into games.\n\nThat durability reached its apex in 1971, a season that stands as one of the most impressive workloads by any pitcher in modern Tigers history. Lolich started 45 games, struck out more than 300 hitters, won 25 games and posted an elite run-prevention profile despite carrying one of the heaviest inning totals of the era. By modern measures, it was an ace-level season, an 8.5 WAR campaign built not just on dominance, but on sheer volume and resilience.\n\nYet to reduce Lolich’s Detroit career to numbers alone misses the point. He pitched for Tigers teams in transition — contenders, retooling clubs and everything in between — and served as a stabilizing force regardless of circumstance. While others came and went, Lolich remained a constant presence, taking the mound with little fanfare and even less complaint.\n\nThat reliability was never more evident than in October.\n\nLolich’s name will forever be linked to the 1968 World Series, when he delivered one of the greatest postseason performances in franchise history. Facing Bob Gibson and the St. Louis Cardinals, Lolich won three games in the series, all complete games, helping lead Detroit to its first championship since 1945. It was a defining moment not only for his career, but for the identity of the Tigers themselves — a team built on pitching, defense and toughness.\n\nIn many ways, Lolich represented the bridge between eras. He pitched alongside stars like Denny McLain and later carried the staff as the Tigers aged out of their late-1960s peak. When McLain’s career unraveled, it was Lolich who absorbed the innings, pressure and expectations that came with being “the guy.”\n\nDetroit fans appreciated that. Lolich was never a self-promoter. He wasn’t chasing accolades or headlines. He pitched with a workmanlike demeanor that resonated in a city that values effort as much as excellence. He fit Detroit because he reflected it — blue-collar, stubbornly competitive and proud of the work itself.\n\nToday’s game looks nothing like the one Lolich dominated. Pitch counts are monitored, starts are limited, and 45-game workloads are unthinkable. That only makes his career more remarkable in hindsight. Lolich didn’t just pitch in a different era — he defined what was possible within it.\n\nAs Detroit remembers Mickey Lolich, it does so not just for the championships, strikeouts, or awards, but for the standard he set. He showed what it meant to carry a franchise, to answer the bell, and to take pride in the responsibility of pitching for Detroit.\n\nA tip of the cap to a true Tigers original.\n\nFollow me on \"X\" @rogcastbaseball",

    "description": "Here’s what Kyle Whittingham had to say about two elite incoming Michigan freshmen — RB Savion Hiter and DE Carter Meadows",
    "fullText": "With it being National Signing Day, Michigan head coach Kyle Whittingham spoke with Mike Hall on the Big Ten Network. Whittingham was asked about two of Michigan’s signees (who committed in December), running back Savion Hiter and defensive end Carter Meadows.\n\nWhittingham on Meadows: “Big, good-looking young man. 6-foot-7, one of the top defensive ends in the country, if not the top. Tremendous athlete. The length, as I mentioned, is a big positive for him. Had some good conversations with Carter. Young man out of Maryland. And we’re excited to get him here in June.”\n\nMeadows ranked as the No. 9 overall recruit in the 2026 class and the No. 1 player out of Washington, DC, per the 247 Sports Composite Rankings. Meadows had 62 tackles as a senior with seven sacks, two forced fumbles, and one fumble recovery.\n\nMichigan hasn’t really had an edge rusher like Meadows, who is tall with a massive wingspan and possesses great burst and power. Meadows has a style reminiscent of Jevon Kearse, whose nickname is “The Freak.” While Meadows is just a freshman, he could receive a steady amount of snaps this season as a rotational piece behind John Henry Daley and Cam Brandt. If Meadows fares well early in the season, he’d be hard to keep off the field. If his film winds up looking anything like how he played in high school, Meadows will be a collegiate star.\n\n#Michigan five-star EDGE commit Carter Meadows (@CarterMeadows_) has some of the best senior film I’ve seen this cycle. \n\nMust watch highlights 🍿 pic.twitter.com/TGcyGy38Ky\n\n— Brice Marich (@BriceMarich) November 6, 2025\n\nWhittingham on Hiter: “Savion, maybe the best back coming out this year. He was a tremendously highly rated player, and he’s here now. He’s doing a great job, we’re in the workouts, and he’s doing very well. Really excited to see what he can do in spring ball.“\n\nWith Justice Haynes transferring to Georgia Tech, Hiter could have a significant role behind RB1 Jordan Marshall. Hiter, a five-star prospect, ranked as the No. 21 overall player in the 2026 class and No. 2 running back. Hiter missed three games last season and still rushed for 1,440 yards and 24 touchdowns in his senior season. Hiter looks like a bruising running back that also possesses elite speed. He was bigger, faster, and stronger than his high school competition and would either blow past defenders in the open field or truck them instead.\n\n5⭐️ Michigan RB signee Savion Hiter pic.twitter.com/TapyAO0e2v\n\n— uofmcoverage (@uofmcoverage) December 4, 2025",

Expect a playbook that stays fluid, attacking an opponent's specific weakness rather than sticking to a script.\n\nReisland noted that Monken \"can maximize whatever these QBs can do.\" With a room featuring the dynamic Shedeur Sanders and Deshaun Watson, Monken won't lean on a one-size-fits-all approach. He specializes in tailoring passing windows and pocket movement to fit his signal-caller’s natural rhythm.\n\nThe message to the locker room is clear. If you can help this team find the end zone, Monken will find a way to use you.

    "description": "It’s been a staple of the wide receiver's routine before each game he’s played this season for the New England Patriots.  It was McDaniels whom Diggs credits with unlocking a work ethic he hadn’t had during his pro career.",
    "fullText": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — Left back pylon. One knee. Head bowed. Eyes closed.\n\nThat is how Stefon Diggs will spend some of his final moments prior to kickoff of the first Super Bowl of his career.\n\nIt’s been a staple of the wide receiver's routine before each game he’s played this season for the New England Patriots.\n\nFollowing pregame warmups, he also calls his teammates in to huddle around him as he leads one of a series of impassioned, fiery and often viral speeches.\n\n“I just say what I feel like I’m supposed to do and just go,” Diggs said. “It’s not so much the words, it’s more so the tenacity.”\n\nThen, he turns the volume down for his prayer in the corner of the end zone.\n\n“Taking a second to kind of appreciate where I am and give my thanks to God and kind of have my little moment with him. Thanking him for the trials and tribulations,” Diggs said. “Building my character up a little bit as a person and making these shoulders weight-bearing, I guess.”\n\nBoth are necessary for the player whom teammates call the emotional centerpiece of their Super Bowl run. And for Diggs, it’s been fuel during a comeback season that didn’t seem likely after his tenure in Houston last season was cut short by a knee injury.\n\nBut, after posting his seventh 1,000-yard receiving season in his 11th year in the league, he may also be the not-so-secret weapon for an offense that will need to be at its best against a Seattle defense that allowed an NFL-low 17.2 points per game during the regular season.\n\nSo many of the things that got Diggs to this point stemmed from an initial sense of trust he found early in his free agent process last summer.\n\nWhen Diggs signed with Houston in 2024, he acknowledged it was in an effort to chase a championship. But Diggs purposely didn’t have many expectations after signing in free agency with New England.\n\nWhat drew him initially to the Patriots was a sense of trust he felt after finding an almost instant connection with wide receivers coach Todd Downing, who was the tight ends coach in Minnesota in 2018 when Diggs was there.\n\nHe got the same thing from the “straight shooter” he met in coach Mike Vrabel, as well as offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels. It was McDaniels whom Diggs credits with unlocking a work ethic he hadn’t had during his pro career.\n\nMcDaniels said the veteran receiver has been the perfect match for second-year quarterback Drake Maye.\n\n“I think it’s great for Drake to be around a player as accomplished at Stef,” McDaniels said. “Drake has learned how to assimilate with him, (to) work together with a player that has been around a long time and been around a lot of good quarterbacks. I think it’s been great for Drake’s growth and development.\"\n\nAfter Diggs eclipsed 1,000 yards during New England’s regular-season finale, a win over Miami, Maye’s mind went back to the preseason when he invited all the receivers to his home state of North Carolina for some throwing sessions.\n\nHe didn’t think someone as “big time” as Diggs would have time to participate. But he did.\n\n“Kind of from that point on, I felt like, man, looking forward to getting with him on the field and seeing him do his thing, and he’s done his thing time and time again,” Maye said. “Some games he’s not getting the ball as much as any receiver would want to, and he’s still trying to block hard and keeps the energy up and breaking the team down and motivating me.\"\n\nWide receiver DeMario Douglas said Diggs also has been central to their group bonding.\n\n“Before this season even started we got close,” Douglas said. “That was a big reason of us not being selfish. Of course, we’re all receivers, we all want to touch the ball. But ... like your brothers, your blood brothers, you want to see them do great no matter what. This is how it is in our room.”\n\nDiggs has also created a new Patriots fan along way, thanks to his high-profile relationship with Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B. She has not only been a force cheering for Diggs on social media, but a presence in team owner Robert Kraft’s suite during games.\n\nShe and Diggs also celebrated the birth of a son together in November. It's helped Diggs keep his mind on football after being accused in December of strangulation and other criminal charges in connection with a dispute with his former private chef. Diggs has denied the allegations.\n\n\"She wasn’t a football girl before I converted her over,” Diggs said. “But I’m just thankful to have her in my corner. She’s an amazing woman and continue to build that relationship. ... I just appreciate her. Hopefully build on that and watch that tree grow.”\n\nAs for Sunday, Diggs expects to bring the same voice for his team that he has all season.\n\n“I mean what I say and say what I mean,” Diggs said. “My teammates know that, and the biggest thing is they know I’m trying not to be a ‘rah-rah’ guy. I try to be more show rather than I tell. It’s the fact that I can back my words up with what I say. I try to go as hard as I can to give it everything I’ve got.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Bobby Miller is looking to return in a big way after a couple of disappointing campaigns with the Dodgers.\n\nThe right-hander began his career with the Dodgers in 2023 and served an important role in the rotation, but has struggled to perform over the past two seasons.\n\n“That’s the motivation for me right now, to get back to how I was a few years ago,” Miller said at DodgerFest on Saturday. “I know it’s still in there, and there’s more than that as well.”\n\nMiller was the Dodgers’ best pitching prospect in 2023, ranking as high as No. 2 among all players within the organization.\n\nMiller made 22 starts in his rookie season, posting an 11-4 record with a 3.76 ERA. He pitched 124.1 innings that season, striking out 119 batters in that time.\n\nThe following season, an early shoulder injury kept Miller on the sidelines from April until June. Upon returning, Miller couldn’t quite produce the results fans saw in 2023. He had a 8.52 ERA through 13 starts, walking batters and allowing home runs at more than double the rate he did in the previous season.\n\n2025 didn’t go much better for Miller, as he had a 12.60 ERA through two appearances in MLB. He spent a majority of the season in Triple-A, where he had a 5.66 ERA through 35 appearances.\n\nHe took on a new role as a reliever in Triple-A, and will likely have to continue playing that role if he wants to make his return to MLB. The Dodgers have had issues with their staff staying healthy in the past, though, so if Miller can keep himself towards the top of the pack in Triple-A, he could get another shot in The Show.\n\nThe post Bobby Miller Looking For Bounce-Back Season in 2026 appeared first on LA Sports Report.",

    "title": "Bears WR review: Grading DJ Moore, Luther Burden in 2025",
    "description": "Our Bears 2025 position reviews continue with wide receiver, a group that experienced ups and downs throughout the season.",
    "fullText": "The Chicago Bears had a magical 2025 season under first-year head coach Ben Johnson, where they went from worst to first with an 11-6 record, NFC North title and the franchise's first playoff win in 15 years. And there's no denying that the future is bright.\n\nWhile the Bears exceeded expectations in their first year under Johnson, there's still plenty of work to be done with this roster, most notably on defense. After overhauling the offense in the trenches and at skill positions, the focus shifts to the defense where the hope is general manager Ryan Poles does the same to round out this unit under defensive coordinator Dennis Allen and form a complete team with a top-five offense.\n\nHere at Bears Wire, we're going position by position through the 2025 Bears and grading every player. Next up is wide receiver, a group that featured a mix of veteran players and youth for quarterback Caleb Williams. DJ Moore and Rome Odunze returned as the top two options, while the Bears added rookie Luther Burden and journeyman Olamide Zaccheaus. The Bears had a balanced group with three players exceeding 650 yards, though it's fair to say they didn't live up to expectations.\n\n2025 stats: 50 receptions, 682 yards, 6 touchdowns; 15 carries, 79 yards, 1 touchdown\n\nComing into the season, questions surrounded DJ Moore and how he would be utilized in Johnson's offense. The playmaking receiver was taking snaps at running back throughout training camp, and some wondered if he would get passed up in the pecking order on passing downs. Those concerns had some validity, as Moore had his worst season statistically in terms of receptions and yards as a pro, but he was paramount to the Bears' success in 2025. Moore made two legendary plays to propel the Bears past the Packers in the regular season and the playoffs, and he came up big on various broken plays to keep Chicago alive. Though Moore isn't living up to his hefty salary as the team's WR1, he was durable, a willing blocker, and did a little bit of everything in 2025. We'll see if he sticks with the Bears in 2026 as trade rumors surround him going into the offseason.\n\n2025 stats: 47 receptions, 652 yards, 2 touchdowns; 6 carries, 37 yards\n\nThe Bears surprised many fans on Day 2 of the NFL Draft when they selected Luther Burden III out of Missouri to join a receiving room that already had Moore and Rome Odunze, but Johnson and the front office knew what they were doing. Burden was a player with rare athleticism in college that projected as a first-round pick. The Bears benefitted when he slipped in the second round, and he became one of the most dependable pass catchers the team had late in the season. Burden was used sparingly early on, sans a 101-yard outing where he scored a 65-yard touchdown off a flea flicker in Week 3. As the weeks wore on, Burden started drawing more and more targets from Williams. He made defenders miss in open space constantly and showed off his speed on deep routes. Burden still has plenty to learn, as he struggled at times with certain play calls, but his rookie season can only be described as a rousing success.\n\n2025 stats: 44 receptions, 661 yards, 6 touchdowns\n\nHopes were high for Odunze heading into Year 2 of his NFL career. After producing as a rookie on a disjointed offense, he was set to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new system being put in place, as well as new coaches like Antwaan Randle El, and his continued connection with Williams. The duo made it known early that they were ready to grow together early in the season when they combined for 470 yards and five touchdowns through seven games. The production was great to see, though Odunze struggled with drops and wasn't always on the same page as his quarterback. Unfortunately, his production dipped after he was diagnosed with a stress fracture in his foot, which eventually forced him to miss the final five regular season games of the year. Odunze returned for the postseason but wasn't 100% healthy and struggled at times. Despite the fast start, the former No. 9 overall pick failed to live up to expectations in 2025.\n\n2025 stats: 39 receptions, 313 yards, 2 touchdowns; 4 carries, 25 yards\n\nThe Bears brought in Olamide Zaccheaus on an affordable one-year deal last offseason as a depth receiver behind Moore and Odunze. He quickly earned the trust of Williams in training camp and became a dependable target early in the year. Zaccheaus was the team's WR3 for half a season, and while he was credited by his teammates for doing the unsung work on offense, he struggled mightily with drops. Eventually, Zaccheaus saw his snaps and targets diminish due to the emergence of Burden. He totaled just 87 yards over his last 10 games. Zaccheaus was a decent role player in 2025 and held the WR3 spot warm until Burden got up to speed. It remains to be seen whether or not Zaccheaus returns in 2026.\n\n2025 stats: 2 receptions, 26 yards\n\nAnother free agent acquisition in 2025, Devin Duvernay filled the Bears' void on special teams at punt and kick returner, while showing up occasionally on offense as a receiver. Duvernay logged just 40 total snaps on offense and wasn't a factor outside of two games where he caught a pair of passes for first downs.\n\n2025 stats: 6 receptions, 87 yards, 2 touchdowns\n\nWho would have thought the Bears' preseason hero would have one of the best moments of the season in a pivotal December matchup? Jahdae Walker, an undrafted free agent, scratched and clawed his way onto the final roster at the end of August following a stellar training camp and preseason, though he rarely saw the field for much of the regular season. Walker was a healthy scratch most of the time, only participating in special teams until the Bears' Week 16 matchup against the Packers. Due to injuries at the position, Walker finally got his shot and made the most of it with a game-tying touchdown to force overtime. Walker followed that up with two more productive outings to end the season. We'll see what his future holds, but for someone who wasn't expected to play any sort of role, Walker delivered when it counted the most.\n\nOn paper, the Bears' wide receivers looked like one of the deepest groups in the league. They had a solid mix of veteran experience and youth that could grow together with one of the best receiver coaches in the league. While the group produced three players with more than 650 yards in a balanced attack, they committed too many drops that stalled drives throughout the season. Williams lost 404 yards due to drops by his pass catchers, per NFL Next Gen Stats. And the season ended on a sour note for the group when it looked like both Moore and Odunze were late getting to their spots on the final offensive play of the divisional round game against the Los Angeles Rams. All in all, it's a talented group that may have a star in the making in Burden. If Odunze can bounce back in 2026, those two will be a solid duo for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Bears WR review: Grading DJ Moore, Luther Burden in 2025",

    "description": "The Athletic reports it was Jeff Stoutland's decision to step down as Eagles offensive line coach. With so many connections, the Saints are a good fit",
    "fullText": "Jeff Stoutland is stepping away as the Philadelphia Eagles' offensive line coach, a position he held since 2013, and it would make a ton of sense for the New Orleans Saints to recruit him. Beyond developing young offensive tackles Kelvin Banks Jr. and Taliese Fuaga, his presence could be transformative for Pro Bowl center Erik McCoy just like it was for Jason Kelce. But is there a real chance the Saints could pull it off? What does Stoutland's immediate future look like?\n\nNFL Network's Mike Garafolo wrote that \"The plan is for Jeff Stoutland to have some sort of involvement\" with the Eagles as an organization, but Stoutland won't be coaching for them, and it's expected that other teams will at least check in with him. The Athletic's Zach Berman reports that \"The Eagles wanted Stoutland back,\" but it was his decision to step down. For their part, the Eagles issued a long goodbye message on social media, saying that \"it's safe to say he will always be welcome in the City of Brotherly Love.\"\n\nThat sure doesn't sound like he'll be back in Philadelphia wearing a headset and Kelly Green sweatshirt on Sundays. And the Saints have more to offer Stoutland than money. After Kellen Moore spent the 2024 season running the Eagles offense and working with him every day, he brought a lot of Stoutland's coworkers with him to New Orleans. That included Doug Nussmeier (the Eagles' quarterbacks coach), Kyle Valero (an assistant working with the wide receivers), and Stoutland's longtime assistant T.J. Paganetti (who had spent a decade with him in Philly), among others.\n\nSo don't dismiss this out of hand. There's a lot to be said for familiarity. Maybe it can make a difference.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Saints Wire: Eagles coach Jeff Stoutland wanted out of Philly, Saints should pursue",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES — In just nine days, teams across MLB will begin to have their pitchers and catchers report to Spring Training, and one familiar superstar has already begun his preparation ahead of the chaos.\n\nComing off back-to-back World Series titles with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Shohei Ohtani begins year three in Dodger blue with a head start, as he was seen Wednesday morning working on his pitching mechanics at the Dodgers Spring Training Facility in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nIt’s widely known that, when it comes to perfecting the little details in terms of a routine, Ohtani is the most precise in the league, and he displayed it once more, going through every second of his pitching motion.\n\nEven down to his foot pushing off the rubber, every movement has to flow to perfection.\n\n#ドジャース #大谷翔平 選手⚾️\n\nアリゾナ州グレンデールで自主トレ💨\n\nキャッチボール🔥#LetsGoDodgers #ShoheiOhtani #侍ジャパン #WBC pic.twitter.com/VRhXLiYLQM\n\n— Masaya Kotani (@MasayaKotani) February 4, 2026\n\nThe world saw the likes of Ohtani pitching for the Dodgers for the first time last year as the season began to wind down, and it was also the first time we got to see the two-way unicorn step on the mound in the postseason en route to the Dodgers' third World Series title in the last five years.\n\nOhtani went through a tedious, yet instrumental, comeback in terms of rehab when it came to his pitching.\n\nWhether it was through a precarious number of live bullpen sessions sprinkled in throughout the majority of the 2025 season, or frequent throwing assignments hours before games, every pitch was a telltale sign of Ohtani’s pitching dominance beginning to shine through.\n\n#大谷翔平 投手は左足スパイク、右足ソックスで壁当てを実施。軸足で地面を蹴る感覚をつかむためでしょうか。珍しい光景でした。@Dodgers #Dodgers pic.twitter.com/XiTKeh0dbw\n\n— 横山尚杜(Naoto Yokoyama) サンスポMLB担当 (@Naoto_SANSPO) February 4, 2026\n\nNow, after scratching off pitching in the postseason for the first time and essentially full steam ahead to pitch with no restrictions in 2026, Ohtani will look forward to next season as the year he contributes on the pitching side for Los Angeles.\n\nOhtani was thought to be working even earlier on his pitching, as he said at DodgersFest last Saturday that there was a possibility that he would pitch for Team Japan in the WBC.\n\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts quickly shot down the idea of Ohtani stepping on the mound for Team Japan a little over an hour after Ohtani spoke to the media, and it was revealed on Tuesday that insurance would not be written off on Ohtani as a pitcher anyway.\n\nWith the WBC out of mind, Ohtani’s early ramp up to Spring Training rewrites the narrative once more that, not only does he want to be a factor to the Dodgers starting rotation in 2026, which is headlined by the likes of fellow countrymen Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Roki Sasaki, along with Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell, but add another piece of hardware to an undeniable resume.\n\nThe 31-year-old Japanese superstar is a four-time unanimous MVP winner, five-time All-Star, four-time Silver Slugger, three-time Hank Aaron Award winner, and American League Rookie of the Year winner in 2018, but the coveted Cy Young Award is the only piece missing from his trophy cabinet.\n\nIf everything goes according to plan and Ohtani can stray away from injury to his throwing arm, 2026 will be the first season Ohtani pitches for Los Angeles from the jump and could notch 20-plus starts like years past.",

    "fullText": "Canadian snowboarder Mark McMorris crashed on Wednesday night and had to be stretchered off the course during big air training ahead of the Milan Cortina Games.\n\nIt's unclear what happened exactly, but the Canadian snowboard team described the crash as “heavy” in a statement. Specifics of McMorris' condition are not yet known, either.\n\n“Snowboarder Mark McMorris had a heavy crash this evening during big air training,” the team said in a statement on social media. “Canadian Olympic Committee and Canada Snowboard staff are attending to him. We will provide more information as it becomes available.”\n\nThe 32-year-old is making his fourth Olympic appearance for Canada. Qualifying for the big air competition is set for Thursday night, one day before the Opening Ceremony. It’s unknown if McMorris will be able to compete anymore.\n\nMcMorris has won three bronze medals in his Olympics career. He claimed third in slopestyle in each of the past three Olympics, and he finished in 10th in the big air competition in both the PyeongChang Olympics in 2018 and the Beijing Olympics in 2022. He has won four of his 12 X Games gold medals in the big air competition, too, which was only added to the Olympics in 2018. In the big air competition at the Olympics, riders take off from a ramp that is more than 165 feet tall.\n\nMcMorris, per the CBC, suffered life-threatening injuries after he slammed into a tree during a backcountry ride in 2017. That resulted in him having a rod placed in his leg, a plate in his arm and another plate in his jaw. Despite that and other significant injuries, McMorris said last month that he felt he was in good health entering these Games.\n\nThe men’s big air final is set for Saturday night at the Livigno Snow Park. Qualification for the men’s slopestyle will start on Monday, Feb. 16.",

    "fullText": "Rivalries are the backbone of the NBA. Rivals Week just passed, but the lineup wasn’t up to par. Some fan-favorite matchups are missing, such as the Spurs and Thunder, or the historic Celtics and Lakers, built off the backs of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.\n\nPlayer rivalries build team rivalries. Seeing players go head-to-head to prove who’s the best is what makes the NBA the most entertaining.\n\nWith that being said, here are the four best player rivalries currently taking place in the NBA:\n\nAnytime Lebron faces off with Steph Curry or Kevin Durant, it’s still a marquee matchup. LeBron, Durant, and Curry are a callback to an era now passed. Every time the NBA begins a new season, fans know they are that much closer to these show-stopping battles are coming to an end.\n\nThat means every game is a must-watch. When any combination of these three go head-to-head, it’s apparent how badly they each want to come out victorious over the other.\n\nFrom Finals matchups to random regular-season contests, each of the three give their all when they step on the court against each other.\n\nA different side of LeBron comes out when he faces Dillon Brooks. We’ve never seen a player get under the King’s skin like the Phoenix Suns guard. This rivalry has been filled with trash talk, physical confrontations, and heated moments.\n\nBrooks is averaging a career high of 21.1 points per game and elevates his play every time he goes up against the Lakers. Los Angeles’ last matchup with the Suns ended in a blowout.\n\nIt seems like Brooks has made it his personal mission to mess with the Hall of Famer, and fans are eagerly awaiting their next duel.\n\nChet Holmgren going up against Victor Wembanyama has been one of the NBA’s most compelling feuds as of late.\n\nSince Wembanyama entered the NBA, he and Chet have had a budding rivalry. The two towering figures first faced off in the 2021 FIBA World Cup, where Holmgren and Team USA walked out with the win.\n\nThe Spurs seem to have the Thunder’s number this year, as they’ve beaten them three times this season. It feels like Wembanyama circles every Thunder game on his calendar.\n\nWembanyama is on a mission to prove he’s far and away the best young center in the NBA. The Spurs’ phenom is a generational talent, but Holmgren has something he doesn’t: a championship ring.\n\nEdwards Vs. SGA is a heavyweight fight with the title for best guard in the NBA on the line. The intensity always reaches a fever pitch when these two play each other. The two players mirror each other in many ways. Both became leaders of their team at a relatively young age and became stars around the same time.\n\nAnt and SGA have taken subtle shots at each other through shoe commercials. It’s clear they both have immense respect for each other, but are fighting to be the best. The Timberwolves have won two out of three matchups with the Thunder this season, but these two will be battling it out for years to come.\n\nAttention player haters and disbelievers of all kinds… pic.twitter.com/5tzoBwvUZ4\n\n— adidas Basketball (@adidasHoops) October 24, 2025\n\nThe post What Are the Best Player Rivalries In the NBA Today? appeared first on The Lead.",

    "title": "From Super Bowl speech to run blocking, how Cooper Kupp helped reshape Seahawks",
    "description": "Cooper Kupp’s Seahawks teammates and coaches raved about his impact as they gear up for the Super Bowl against the New England Patriots.",
    "fullText": "Frisman Jackson didn’t waste any time when the Seattle Seahawks signed Cooper Kupp in last spring. The Seahawks receivers coach knew what Kupp represented. He was formerly one of the most productive receivers in NFL history — a Super Bowl MVP after winning the statistical triple crown in 2021 — who had just been cut by the Los Angeles Rams after three straight sub-1,000 yard seasons.\n\nKupp’s perspective, Jackson thought, would be invaluable toward helping his group elevate the Seahawks to make a run to the Super Bowl. The receiving corps was at an inflection point after trading D.K. Metcalf to the Pittsburgh Steelers and releasing Tyler Lockett days before signing Kupp. All while the team was pivoting at quarterback away from Geno Smith toward Sam Darnold.\n\nSo Jackson tapped Kupp to get up in front of the meeting room and offer his perspective to his fellow receivers.\n\n“I had him talk in the front of the group and say, ‘talk to us about your experience the year ya’ll went to the Super Bowl,’” Jackson said. “We’ve been on this mission since before we came for phase one (of the offseason program) when I had him stand in front of the room and talk about what it means to play in the Super Bowl.”\n\nKupp’s words wound up being helpful and prophetic. The Seahawks are in the Bay Area preparing for Super Bowl LX and are 4.5-point favorites over the New England Patriots to lift the organization’s second Lombardi Trophy. They got there on the back of arguably the NFL’s best defense, but there’s little chance they would have earned the No. 1 seed in the NFC and beat the 49ers and Rams in the playoffs without the play of their receivers complementing Darnold’s ascension in his first season with Seattle.\n\n“It’s about playing for each other,” Kupp said. “I think one of the things that I’ve noticed that the best teams I’ve been a part of, guys play for the guy next to them. It’s a cliché thing, but it’s the hardest thing to do when you get to the NFL because there’s so much at stake. And it’s hard for people with their own ambitions, their own families and all this different stuff that’s going on, to commit to the belief that truly the best thing for them and the best thing for our team is that the team succeeds.\n\n“The most powerful thing you can do is have a group of guys that are playing for something outside of themselves and we’ve had a lot of guys embody that this year.”\n\nThe Seahawks haven’t been to a Super Bowl since winning it after the 2013 season. Only four players on the roster have Super Bowl experience. One is Kupp, who caught eight passes for 92 yards and two touchdowns in the 23-20 win over the Bengals in Super Bowl LVI. Two others were his teammates with the Rams: Ernest Jones IV and running back Cam Akers. Darnold served as Brock Purdy’s backup with the 49ers during the loss to the Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII.\n\nThe Seahawks have leaned on Kupp’s experience in their preparation for Sunday against the New England Patriots.\n\n“I can’t speak highly enough of Coop. What he’s meant to our offense, not only our offense but our team. The mindset that he has,” Darnold said. “The way he leads by example. If he does say things, he’s one of those guys where the entire room is dead silent. And they’re super focused on what he’s saying because we know that he doesn’t waste his breath. He’s always going to be able to say something very mindful. For us, speaking for the players, but also the coaches, he’s had a huge impact on all of us in that building. Really fun playing for Coop and what he’s brought to all of us.”\n\nKupp has been a tone setter for his fellow receivers and pushed to raise the standard for players and coaches, Jackson said.\n\n“He challenges you as a coach from a schematic standpoint. He’s going to ask questions and you better know the answers to them,” Jackson said. “You can’t bull crap him.”\n\nJackson said Kupp specifically elevated the conversation about receivers’ blocking in the running game. It stems from Kupp playing for Rams coach Sean McVay, who like Kubiak and other coaches from the Kyle Shanahan tree, emphasizes receivers blocking when they’re not catching passes.\n\nAnd while trying to take the onus off Darnold and playing to their defense, the Seahawks had the third most rushing attempts in the NFL during the season.\n\n“Before I had Coop, when I talked about the run game, it was very limited, because most wideouts say, ‘give me my rule, who I’m supposed to block, and that’s the end of it,’” Jackson said. “With Coop, I’ve really had to be locked in. He’s going to ask me, what’s the Mike point, what’s the call that the O-line is going to and how it affects his block. And so he’s really challenged me in that regard and really changed my coaching style and philosophy and how I teach the run game to the guys.”\n\nKupp’s production isn’t at the same level as his previous Super Bowl season. In 2025, he had modest totals of 47 catches for 593 yards, the second fewest of his career, with just two touchdowns. It was a far cry from the 145 catches for 1,947 yards and 16 touchdowns when he posted one of the great seasons in NFL history in 2021, which he capped by earning Super Bowl MVP for catching a pair of touchdowns in the victory over the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nThe 32-year-old caught a touchdown against his former team in this year’s NFC championship game, with three of his four catches converting third downs in the 31-27 victory. He finished with 36 yards.\n\nBut what Kupp lacked in numbers throughout the season, he made up for in leadership and providing a good example for his teammates, which began with his speech in March.\n\nKupp has helped Jaxon Smith-Njigba grow into one of the game’s most productive receivers. Kupp said Wednesday there were similarities to their games, with Smith-Njigba initially being thought of as a slot receiver before being moved all over the field in 2025. Smith-Njigba had a Kupp-like 1,793 yards to lead the NFL this season.\n\nAsked what advice Kupp gave Smith-Njigba that has stuck with him most: “Process over results,” Smith-Njigba said.\n\nSeattle’s brass moved on from Metcalf and Lockett to allow Smith-Njigba to have a runway to more targets. And Kupp was added because he played in a similar scheme in L.A. that Seattle would run under first-year coordinator Klint Kubiak, who is expected to be named the new head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders after Sunday’s Super Bowl.\n\nKupp had no problem not being Seattle’s top target.\n\n“You got guys who make be locker room lawyers — they might go in a corner somewhere and complain about things. That’s not Coop,” Jackson said. “He’s been fantastic. I could talk hours and hours about the professional that he is, how he goes about his business and how selfless he is.”",

    "description": "Artemi Panarin’s run on Broadway is over. After seven memorable seasons with the New York Rangers, Panarin’s off to Hollywood",
    "fullText": "Artemi Panarin’s run on Broadway is over. After seven memorable seasons with the New York Rangers, Panarin’s off to Hollywood following a trade to the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nPanarin had 607 points (205 goals, 402 assists) in 482 regular-season games over seven seasons with the Rangers, and his 1.26 points-per-game average is best in franchise history. He ranks eighth all-time for the Rangers in assists, ninth in points, and 14th in goals.\n\nHe left behind a treasure trove of memorable highlights in New York, and will be remembered as one of the most exciting players ever to wear the Blueshirts sweater.\n\nLet’s break down the 10 greatest moments for Panarin during his tenure with the Rangers.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin and former Blue Jackets teammate Sergei Bobrovsky are dear friends, but the Breadman made his countryman — and star defenseman Aaron Ekblad — look silly when he dangled around both and snuck a back-hand shot past the Florida Panthers goalie for a highlight-reel goal in the first period in Sunrise, Florida.\n\nWhy it was great: Before arriving in New York, Panarin owned the Rangers, with 12 goals and 18 points in 12 career games. So it was a relief to see Panarin register his first three-goal game in a Blueshirts sweater in Game 31 of his first season. Panarin had an assist on Mika Zibanejad‘s power-play goal that tied the game, then sealed the hat trick with a pair of goals late in the third period of the Rangers’ 6-3 win over the San Jose Sharks.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin scored a career-high four goals against the Carolina Hurricanes, helping the Rangers turn a 2-1 second-period deficit into a 6-2 laugher. He also had an assist to record points on five of New York’s six goals.\n\nWhy it was great: Maybe the last memorable moment for Panarin in a Rangers sweater. With New York up 1-0 late in the first period, Panarin floated a seeing-eye shot past Bobrovsky in the outdoor contest played in Miami. It ended up being the game-winning goal, and Panarin also added an assist in the Rangers’ 5-1 win over the Panthers.\n\nWhy it was great: It’s easy to forget how far the Rangers had fallen and how quickly that drop off was after so much success for most of the 2010s. But the Letter 1.0, authored in February 2018 by then-GM Jeff Gorton and team president Glen Sather, ushered in a rebuild that climaxed earlier than expected when Panarin signed a mammoth seven-year, $81.5 million contract. The Rangers outbid the Islanders and Blues Jackets for his services, and Panarin was worth every penny. He led the Rangers in scoring six straight seasons before traded to the Kings, and the Blueshirts reached the Eastern Conference Final in 2022 and 2024, and won the Presidents’ Trophy in 2023-24 with Panarin a vital member of their core.\n\nWhen: Oct. 12, 2023-Nov. 18, 2023\n\nWhy it was great: The 2023-24 season was undoubtedly Panarin’s best ever, and he started it with a bang by setting the Rangers record for longest season-opening point streak. Panarin had 10 goals and 16 assists, and the Rangers were 12-2-1 in that stretch. That streak set New York on the path toward its Metropolitan Division championship and the franchise’s fourth Presidents’ Trophy. It also started Panarin on the way to 120 points, second most in Rangers history.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin often showed off his Rockettes-style leg kick after big goals, but it all started with this highlight-reel tally against the Detroit Red Wings early in 2020. Panarin dangled around Detroit defenseman Alex Biega then snuck a back-hand shot past Jimmy Howard to put the Rangers up 3-0. He sealed the goal with a kick, which became his signature celebration.\n\nWhy it was great: Playing outside at MetLife Stadium in front of a pro-Rangers crowd crowd of roughly 80,000, the Blueshirts fell behind 4-1 in the second period then trailed 5-3 in the late stages of the third period against the rival Islanders. Yet, Chris Kreider deflected Panarin’s point shot on the power play past Ilya Sorokin to make it 5-4. After Zibanejad tied it with another power-play tally, Panarin sent the Rangers fans into delirium by stealing Noah Dobson’s pass on the opening shift of overtime and beating Sorokin for an emotional 6-5 comeback win, though only after video review upheld his OT winner.\n\nWhy it was great: Panarin scored the game-winning goal in Game 1 of the Rangers’ second-round playoff series against the Hurricanes, then had three assists in a 4-3 win in Game 2. But the Rangers coughed up a late 2-1 lead in Game 3 on the road when Andrei Svechnikov tied the score with the net empty at the other end. But Panarin’s hard work paid off early in OT, when he got inside position on Carolina’s Jalen Chatfield and redirected Vincent Trocheck‘s pass by Pyotr Kochetkov for the game-winning goal at 1:43 of the extra session, giving the Rangers a commanding 3-0 lead in the series. The Rangers ultimately claimed the series in six games.\n\nWhy it was great: It had been five years since the Rangers won a series in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, and they looked destined for another early exit after losing a three-overtime classic in Game 1 and fell behind 3-1 to the Pittsburgh Penguins in the best-of-7 first round — especially after they allowed seven goals apiece in Games 3 and 4. But after the Rangers won Games 5 and 6, sending the series to MSG for Game 7, Panarin authored his signature Rangers moment, fittingly on the power play in overtime of the do-or-die game. He dusted off a pass from Adam Fox twice then wristed the game-winner through traffic and past Tristan Jarry, sending the Rangers to the second round.\n\nRangers trade Artemi Panarin to Kings for Liam Greentree, draft picks\n\nEx-Rangers captain Jacob Trouba throws shade, ‘having more fun’ in Anaheim\n\nRangers running out of time to trade Artemi Panarin before NHL roster freeze\n\nRangers coach provides brief Artemi Panarin update, waiting for trade",

    "description": "Patriots wide receiver Kayshon Boutte detailed the ways that teammate Stefon Diggs motivated him to succeed in the 2025 NFL season.",
    "fullText": "New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs has made an impact on WR Kayshon Boutte this season.\n\nBoutte was available at Day 2 of Super Bowl week on Tuesday. He, along with several other players, in addition to coaches, spoke to the media with Super Bowl LX just days away. Boutte was asked about his missed connections with quarterback Drake Maye in the postseason, as well as his struggles on and off the field that he divulged with The Players’ Tribune, among other questions.\n\nPer Blitz Sports Media’s Ryan Linkletter, Boutte gave Diggs his just due when asked about the latter’s impression on the wide receiver room in New England.\n\n“I would say personally for my development, I felt like it was always good to have a great receiver come in. I felt like it always pushed me to be great,” Boutte said. “So I think that’s one thing I told myself in the offseason. Whatever he do, I’m going to match it. Just to try to get myself to where I want to be.”\n\nDiggs was signed by the Patriots after recording six 1,000-yard receiving seasons in six of the seven years before he arrived in New England. The two-time All-Pro receiver opened the field up for Boutte with the attention he garnered from opposing defenses.\n\nBoutte caught a career-high 71.7 percent of his passes in 2025 — up 8.5 percent from 2024 — with additional career-highs in yards per target (12), as well as yards per reception (16.7).

    "description": "Holders Newcastle United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Manchester City on Wednesday night and a challenging season shows no sign of relenting.",
    "fullText": "Newcastle United players waited impatiently in the tunnel at the Etihad.\n\nIt was three minutes until kick-off and the Carabao Cup holders were desperate to get going as a bemused Kieran Trippier looked around and wondered where his counterparts from Manchester City were.\n\nThere was no sign of Pep Guardiola's team.\n\nThe hosts took their time to emerge from the dressing room, but they quickly left Newcastle in a daze after racing into a 3-0 lead in the second leg of their semi-final.\n\nOn a day CEO David Hopkinson doubled down on his assertion that Newcastle will be competing for the biggest prizes by 2030, the naive visitors looked a long way off in that first half.\n\nHead coach Eddie Howe certainly did not hold back in the away dressing room as he made a triple change at half-time.\n\n\"I was really annoyed,\" he said.\n\nNewcastle managed to rally after the break and pulled one back through substitute Anthony Elanga as they bowed out with a 5-1 defeat on aggregate.\n\nDespite the loss, those 5,400 supporters in the away end repeatedly chanted \"Eddie Howe's black and white army\", in recognition of the head coach who ended the club's seven-decade wait for a major domestic trophy in this very competition.\n\nBut this has been a challenging season for Newcastle and it shows no signs of relenting.\n\nIn truth, Newcastle have yet to catch fire six months into the campaign.\n\nThat may seem a curious statement.\n\nNewcastle have reached a third EFL Cup semi-final in four years.\n\nHowe's side remain favourites to progress past Qarabag into the last 16 of the Champions League.\n\nThey could still get back to Wembley through the FA Cup - even if an awkward fourth-round tie against Aston Villa awaits next week.\n\nBut Newcastle sit in 11th place in the Premier League.\n\nThe players previously spoke among themselves about trying to make history once again by becoming the first Newcastle side to qualify for the Champions League in successive campaigns.\n\nHowever, this travel sick team have only won two away games in the top flight this season.\n\nHowe's men have picked up just 11 points from a possible 36 against those sides currently above them in the division.\n\nThey have dropped 16 points from winning positions.\n\nIt has felt like a season of transition, following the damaging departure of top scorer Alexander Isak, and Howe's response was telling when asked if he could tolerate such a word this week.\n\n\"I can,\" he said. \"Transition from the team is an obvious one because we brought players in from the summer and we lost players in the summer.\n\n\"There was always going to be a change to the team. Now change doesn't have to be negative - it can be positive. We are trying to find that flow and rhythm that we have been searching for all season, really.\n\n\"In terms of the club, it's growing and changing all the time and I think will continue to change in the next few years, probably at a rapid pace at some stage. The club is definitely in transition - but transitioning for the positive in my opinion.\"\n\nThere have certainly been glimpses of what this team could be in recent weeks.\n\nThere was a devastating first-half display against Chelsea, a spirited hour away to Paris St-Germain and a fine opening half an hour or so at Anfield.\n\nBut games are not won in snatches.\n\nIt has been a frustration of the coaching staff that they have lacked the training time during an unrelenting run of fixtures to really work on things and piece it all together like they have during previous sticky spells.\n\nInstead the players have come to rely on meeting rooms, analysis sessions and walk-throughs.\n\nThis is the reality of life at clubs who aspire to fight on multiple fronts, of course, but competing in four competitions was an unprecedented feat for Newcastle going into February.\n\nThe relentless nature of the schedule has had a knock-on effect on the squad - Bruno Guimaraes, Joelinton, Tino Livramento and Fabian Schar are all currently sidelined, while Anthony Gordon hobbled off with a hamstring issue on Wednesday night.\n\nIt has also had an impact on the adaptation of Newcastle's summer signings who, aside from defender Malick Thiaw, are still finding their feet at the club.\n\nThiaw, Jacob Ramsey, Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa all joined in the final fortnight or so of a turbulent window, in which the club operated without a sporting director and missed out on a host of top targets.\n\nNewcastle, remarkably, are still searching for a settled combination in the final third despite spending £179m on forwards.\n\nElanga enjoyed a lively second-half cameo at the Etihad, but Woltemade was substituted at half-time - having failed to score since December - while the rusty Wissa missed a host of good chances in both legs.\n\nIt leaves Newcastle with more questions than answers as they embark on a crunch run of fixtures.\n\n\"Where does that leave our season?\" Howe asked. \"We're still fighting on several fronts.\n\n\"The games are coming thick and fast. There's no let-up for us. We need to get back to winning ways as quickly as possible. It's the only thing that gives you new energy.\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

He wants to retire with the Milwaukee Bucks\n\nGiannis dunking in front of Benny the Bull instead of Bango would not be the kind of inside stuff trade news Bucks nation could accept.\n\nBut before anybody gets too worked up about Antetokounmpo being traded 90 minutes south, there's a reason for this absolute madness.\n\nGiannis to Chicago is now down to +275 \n\nOne bettor has a series of bets at various odds that would turn $1,075 into $22,575 if Giannis is traded to the Bulls before the deadline 👀 pic.twitter.com/xGrd8esXth\n\n— DK Insights (@DKInsights_) February 2, 2026\n\nBecause trade bets like this have limited action, it does not take a large wager to move the action considerably.

    "description": "\"WWE SmackDown\" star Kit Wilson recently sat down with Chris Van Vliet and explained some of the inspiration behind his new, viral theme music.",
    "fullText": "Kit Wilson, formerly of Pretty Deadly, is doing a fantastic job of making a name for himself outside of the tag team while Elton Prince is on the shelf following neck surgery. Part of the way he's doing it, in addition to his gimmick denouncing toxic masculinity, is a catchy new theme tune that has taken social media by storm.\n\nWilson told Chris Van Vliet on his \"Insight\" podcast that he was hoping the song would be catchy, but he didn't realize how popular it would be. He explained that he had a fair amount of input into the song, and was pushing for new music when he found out he'd be going solo.\n\n\"I started messaging a lot saying, 'I would love new music. Can I get new music?'\" he explained. \"Then, eventually I got into contact with Neil [Lawi], I believe, and then he called me. We had a little discussion on the phone. He said, 'What kind of thing are you looking for?' So I said, 'Can I send you an email?' Got off the phone and I started writing this email, just with all my references. With all the songs I like. All the ideas I had. Lyrics. Kind of the theme of it, the vibe of it.\"\n\nWilson explained he timestamped bits of songs he liked and sent them off to the music producers. The phone call that opens his theme is inspired by a Charlie XCX and Billie Eilish song that opens the same way, though he said he initially asked for an English voice for the \"Hey Kit, are you there?\" Other influences included \"Like Jennie\" by Black Pink and \"Femininomenon\" by Chappell Roan, in addition to some Harry Styles influence.\n\nWilson's new theme caught fire during his January 2 \"WWE SmackDown\" match against Matt Cardona, kicking off the pair's feud. The star has been on his own since Prince suffered an injury during a match in May 2025. He explained Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque asked him if he wanted new music, and Wilson said as much as he cherishes Pretty Deadly, it was time to move on.\n\n\"I was scared, but I just felt like if we're going to this new chapter, we have to go,\" he said. \"So I said, 'I want to get rid of all that.' Then, obviously, if it comes back, it comes back. But I just wanted to start new.\"\n\nThe star appears to be having a blast with his new song, as much as the crowd and those on social media. He can be seen singing along to the music during his entrance, and he told Van Vliet while he loves a \"little lip sync moment,\" it hasn't been easy.\n\n\"I have been struggling,\" he said. \"The crowd makes noise, which has been really annoying, because I can't hear my music. I can't sing along... But, I love the music. I love the lyrics, and again, with the email, there were certain words and certain lyrics. I wanted 'Pretty Deadly' in there. I wanted some kind of reference. So there's just little Easter eggs in it.\"\n\nIf you use any quotes from this article, please credit \"Insight with Chris Van Vliet\" and provide a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

On Wednesday, among a number of reports of requested interviews, the Cardinalas are looking at a young assistant on Houston Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans' staff.\n\nAccording to NFL Network's Mike Garafolo, the Cardinals have requested an interview with Texans defensive backs coach Dino Vasso.\n\nVasso has been with the Texans since 2021, first coaching cornerbacks from 2021-2023, and then all the defensive backs the last two seasons.\n\nHouston's defensive backfield is one of the best in the NFL with players like Derek Stingley Jr., Kamari Lassiter, Jalen Pitre and more.\n\nPrior to his time with the Texans, he was with the Philadelphia Eagles from 2016-2020 as a defensive quality control coach, assistant secondary coach and assistant coordinator on defense.\n\nFrom 2013-2015, he was a coaching assistant for the Kansas City Chiefs under Andy Reid.\n\nLaFleur has not crossed paths with Vasso on any coaching staff yet, but the Cardinals clearly think the young, up-and-coming coach is worth interviewing.\n\nThese names have come up so far:\n\nRams assistant head coach and pass game coordinator Aubrey Pleasant\n\nNew York Giants outside linebackers coach Charlie Bullen\n\nNo one has reported it, but Nick Rallis, the Cardinals' DC for the last three seasons, presumably could be in the mix.\n\nGet more Cardinals and NFL coverage from Cards Wire's Jess Root and others by listening to the latest on the Rise Up, See Red podcast.

    "description": "New Dolphins offensive coordinator Bobby Slowik isn't trying to tear the offense Mike McDaniel built down to its studs.",
    "fullText": "Bobby Slowik isn't planning on tearing the Miami Dolphins offense down to the studs and rebuilding it from scratch. The team's new offensive coordinator, who spent last season as its senior passing game coordinator, says his unit won't look too different than it did during Mike McDaniel's time as head coach.\n\n\"We're all from the same [coaching] tree,\" Slowik told reporters Wednesday. \"The way I like to frame it is very similar to like the bones are the same, the roots are the same, but all the trees grow different. A lot of that has to do with the players you have on any given team, which changes year to year. I think a lot of people don't realize how much even within a specific offense, your offense morphs and changes year to year, and that's dependent on the people you have on that team at that time.\n\n\"I believe in running the ball, believe strongly in running the ball. I think most of the successful teams in the NFL these days run the ball really well at a high clip and really build it from there as far as you got to win in the trenches. I like keeping the defense off balance. It’s probably my No. 1 thing as far as what I look for as a play caller, while making sure I marry it to who we have on the team. Then in the pass game, we're all about precision and detail.\"\n\nWhile new Dolphins general manager Jon-Eric Sullivan has a lot of work to do to get the team back on track, there's a good chance much of the Miami offense will still look the same. The team has a star running back in De'Von Achane, a top wide receiver in Jaylen Waddle, and at least a couple of starting offensive linemen already in place with Patrick Paul at left tackle and Aaron Brewer at center.\n\nSlowik doesn't want to change too much about the Dolphins run game, which has included fullback Alec Ingold for the last four years.\n\n“Yeah, we have Alec (Ingold) on the roster, and I would love if Alec was able to stay here,\" Slowik said. \"I think that'd be awesome. I think he's a fantastic leader. I've used a fullback before. I think it's powerful within the offense. I don't think it's required. I think you just need to make sure you have good players and Alec is a good player. So obviously having him here would be fantastic.”\n\nThe big question, however, is what the Dolphins will do at quarterback. While Slowik said that Tua Tagovailoa could \"absolutely bounce back\" from his rough 2025 season, it'd be a surprise if the quarterback is still in Miami by the end of the offseason. The only other Dolphins passers under contract for the 2026 season are Quinn Ewers and Cam Miller.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Dolphins Wire: Dolphins offense will have 'same bones, same roots' under Bobby Slowik",

    "fullText": "“Lokdog” plans to eradicate his opponent.\n\nSurging Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Bantamweight contender Vinicius Oliveira will headline his first UFC event when he takes on Mario Bautista in the main event of UFC Vegas 113 this weekend (Sat., Feb. 7, 2026) inside the UFC Apex in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nAnd if Oliveira has his way, it won’t be a long night.\n\nSpeaking with MMAMania.com during UFC Vegas 113 media day, the Brazilian contender suggested the matchup was designed with a clear purpose: eliminating Bautista, who has drawn criticism for his grinding, low-output style — something Oliveira believes the promotion is ready to move on from.\n\n“I think the UFC made a good choice, a good matchup because he’s a boring fighter, and I think the UFC wanted to put him out,” Oliveira said. “They put me here for the chance to put him out.”\n\nOliveira didn’t stop there, predicting a first-round knockout to cap off the biggest opportunity of his UFC career.\n\nWith a victory, “Lokdog” would claim Bautista’s No. 9 ranking at Bantamweight — and in Oliveira’s mind, that puts him on a fast track to title contention.\n\n“I see myself by the end of the year fighting for the belt for sure,” Oliveira said. “But before that, I’m going to fight against a top five. I’m going to put on a great performance for the audience, and then in the middle of the year I’m going to fight against a top five in the rankings.”\n\nOliveira also hinted at two specific top-five opponents he’d like to face later this year, potentially on the UFC White House card.\n\n“There’s only two guys in the top five that I would be able to fight there. But it doesn’t matter who,” Oliveira added. “I’m going to fight in the middle of the year again, and then this year I’m going to fight for the belt against anyone. It doesn’t matter.”\n\nWhile the Bantamweight title picture is currently logjammed — with champion Petr Yan sidelined until at least July and a trilogy with Merab Dvalishvili looming — Oliveira believes a dominant finish this weekend, followed by a statement win over a top-five opponent, could force the UFC’s hand.\n\nThe 30-year-old has long called for a matchup with Umar Nurmagomedov, even accusing the Russian contender of avoiding him since Oliveira’s incredible UFC debut. Whether that fight materializes later this year remains to be seen.\n\nFor now, Oliveira’s focus is singular: get past Bautista — a notoriously tough out — and do it in emphatic fashion.\n\nFor the rest of the UFC Vegas 113 fight card and Paramount+ lineup click here.",

    "fullText": "We will have one last Colorado Avalanche hockey game before some players head to Milan for the winter games, and it will be against the young, up-and-coming San Jose Sharks at Ball Arena. The Avalanche will be looking to tidy up a bit after a 2-0 defeat suffered at the hands of their old rival, the Detroit Red Wings. The Sharks are currently on a three-game slide, and both teams want to head to the break with a victory, but who will it be?\n\nOne more time! pic.twitter.com/5lPeCr7CBz\n\n— Colorado Avalanche (@Avalanche) February 4, 2026\n\nThe Opponent: San Jose Sharks (27-23-4)\n\nWatch: Altitude, Altitude+, ESPN+\n\nListen: Altitude Sports Radio, 92.5 FM\n\nIf this matchup were happening in November of 2025, I’d say there would be just about no shot for the San Jose Sharks to come into Ball Arena and steal points from the likes of Nathan MacKinnon and Co.\n\nToo bad it’s February of 2026, when the boys have been more blue than burgundy, and are 3-5-2 in their last 10 games and have struggled to remain consistent since the calendar turned.\n\nThe Avalanche have been the first team to every increment of 10 total points throughout the season and have led the league most of the way, but that doesn’t paint the whole picture in Colorado. They are an unbelievably effective team at 5-on-5, but still can’t figure out really anything with a man advantage. It has fans and pundits scratching their heads.\n\nTheir net PP% is 10.3. In the last 10 years that ranks 332nd out of 344.\n\n— Mike Kelly (@MikeKellyNHL) February 3, 2026\n\nIt would be just like the Avalanche to tally two or more power-play goals just ahead of the Olympic break, to spite us all.\n\nWe got word this morning that, although they are skating and will represent their respective countries at the Olympics, Martin Necas and Gabe Landeskog will not play this evening.\n\nArtturi Lehkonen — Nathan MacKinnon — Valeri Nichushkin\nRoss Colton — Brock Nelson — Victor Olofsson\nParker Kelly — Jack Drury — Gavin Brindley\nTaylor Makar — Zakhar Bardakov — Joel Kiviranta\n\nDevon Toews — Cale Makar\nJosh Manson — Brent Burns\nSamuel Girard — Sam Malinski\n\nMacKenzie Blackwood\nScott Wedgewood\n\nThe Sharks are a young, promising team led by phenom Macklin Celebrini. This matchup could become a first-round playoff battle if things continue as they have so far in 2025-26, but the two lineups will likely look a bit different by then.\n\nOver Macklin Celebrini’s last 82 games, he’s a 100-plus point player at 19-YEARS OLD 👀 pic.twitter.com/RJJWNpB0gS\n\n— BarDown (@BarDown) January 31, 2026\n\nCelebrini hasn’t just been decent; he’s lighting it up like a cagey veteran scorer, and he’s already shown he’s an elite play driver and scorer at just 19 years of age. He will be the youngest player at this year’s Olympic Games and the youngest Canadian to make Team Canada when NHL players are involved. Impressive stuff.\n\nWill Smith — Macklin Celebrini — Kiefer Sherwood\nWilliam Eklund — Michael Misa — Tyler Toffoli\nPhilipp Kurashev — Alexander Wennberg — Collin Graf\nBarclay Goodrow — Adam Gaudette\n\nMario Ferraro — Timothy Liljegren\nDmitry Orlov — John Klingberg\nShakir Mukhamadullin — Vincent Desharnais\n\nAlex Nedeljkovic\nYaroslav Askarov\n\nFollow along in the comments below!",

    "fullText": "The Los Angeles Dodgers are World Series favorites heading into the 2026 season, but how does the organization fare in the long-term?\n\nPresident of baseball operations Andrew Friedman spoke on how the Dodgers plan to maintain their success in the future.\n\n“Infusing young players over that time is going to be really important for us to be able to maintain (this level of success),” Friedman said to Jack Harris of the California Post.\n\nThe Dodgers have featured in the playoffs for the last 13 seasons and the team doesn’t plan on messing up that streak in 2026 and beyond.\n\nDespite coming off back-to-back World Series titles in 2026, the Dodgers have the second-best farm system in the league. Their organizational depth is what should carry the Dodgers’ success in the long-term, at least that’s what Friedman hopes for.\n\nThe defending champions have several young players waiting on the sidelines for their big league opportunity, and finding a place for them will be key with an aging Dodgers roster.\n\nThe league’s current CBA is set to expire Dec . 1 and the Dodgers’ recent signing of Kyle Tucker to a four-year, $240 million deal has reportedly infuriated MLB owners heading into the expected labor battle between MLB and the players’ union.\n\nThe Tucker deal has given team owners reason to push for a salary cap, and even if that goal isn’t achieved, the result could be harsher luxury-tax penalties.\n\nThe Dodgers would inevitably be affected by both outcomes as the organization has already paid more than double for every free agent they’ve signed this winter because of tax penalties.\n\nFriedman revealed there’s really no way the Dodgers can prepare for what will ensue.\n\n“There’s just so much unknown around that,” Friedman said. “I’ve now been through a lot of CBAs and have tried to get cute leading into a CBA. Like, ‘OK, this is where it might be going.’ (Right now), we have no idea. We are sitting in the cheap seats on that. So for us, it’s about, whatever the rules are, reading and reacting to it and doing everything we can within the rules to be as good as we can be.”\n\nMore news: Former Dodgers Catcher Austin Barnes Signs With Mets on Minor League Deal",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (17-4, 7-1 SEC) is currently taking on Alabama for a midweek road trip, looking to reach 8-1 in conference play, and stay atop the conference standings before hosting Florida on Saturday afternoon.\n\nFirst-year head coach Bucky McMillan has led the Aggies to their second-best start in SEC play since joining the conference before the 2012 season, and wouldn't be anywhere this season without Spanish sharpshooter Rubén Dominguez, who is averaging 12.9 points per game, 2.4 rebounds, 1.5 assist, and averaging 44.9% from the field, 43.4% frome three-point, and 89.6% from the free throw line.\n\nOne of the best three-point shooters in the country, Dominguez is expected to remain a key part of McMillan's future rosters with two years of eligibility, and in the new age of college basketball, landing international players during the transfer portal period has become a popular trend, and will continue, especially in the SEC.\n\nDuring Dominguez's transition to Texas A&M, McMillan and his staff encountered no issues beyond travel, which took longer than for the other 14 new additions to the roster.\n\nHowever, the drama surrounding former NBA G-League center Charles Bediako, who returned to Alabama late last month, is currently playing vs. Texas A&M, but will be back in court after receiving a temporary restraining order by Judge James Roberts, who has since recused himself from the case.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bediako’s attorneys reportedly sent the NCAA a list of admissions regarding the eligibility of international professional basketball players, including Texas A&M star Rubén Dominguez. Within the document provided by Bama247 writer Mike Rodak, Bediako's legal team listed the Texas A&M sophomore as the 38th example of an international player who was granted eligibility.\n\n\"Admit that you have granted eligibility to Ruben Dominguez, a current student-athlete at Texas A&M University and former member of Movistar Estudiantes from Spain.\"\n\nAlabama is currently 14-7 and 4-4 in SEC play before the conclusion of Wednesday's, and if Bediako isn't granted an eligibility extension, the Crimson Tide will be lacking size in the front court.\n\nBediako’s attorneys sent the NCAA a list of admissions regarding the eligibility of international professional basketball players. pic.twitter.com/Uheimc2BXq\n\n— Mike Rodak (@mikerodak) February 4, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes and opinions. Follow Cameron on X: @CameronOhnysty.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Aggies Wire: Rubén Dominguez is named in Charles Bediako's eligibility dispute",

After ending his college career at UConn, Kimball was picked up with the 29th overall selection of the 1965 NBA draft by the Celtics.\n\nThe Framingham, Massachusetts native would play the first season of his NBA career with Boston, coming to an end when he was picked up by the (then) San Diego (now, Houston) Rockets in the 1967 NBA expansion draft. His stay with the team lasted until he was dealt to the Milwaukee Bucks in 1971\n\nDuring his time suiting up for the Rockets, Kimball wore only jersey No. 7 and put up 7.3 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 1.4 assists per game.\n\nAll stats and data courtesy of Basketball Reference.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rockets Wire: Rockets jersey history No. 7 - Toby Kimball (1967-71)",

    "fullText": "A hypothesis of schizophrenia is presented that proposes a psychopharmacological model as an addition to the diathesis-stress model. The opioid peptide dynorphin may help bridge together various hypotheses of schizophrenia. The dopamine, glutamate, serotonin, and social defeat hypotheses of schizophrenia are explored. Mechanisms underlying hallucinogenesis and stress overlap, specifically in the opioid system. A psycho-bio-social model for stress-induced psychotic symptoms is explored. As stress impacts one’s affect, amplified salience for affect-congruent memories and perceptions may factor into the development of aberrant perceptions and beliefs. As another mechanism, stress-induced dissociation from important memories about the world that are used to build a worldview may lead one to form conclusions that contradict the missing memories/information.\n\nLater comparisons and contrasts are made with classical psychedelics and THC. Psychedelic mechanisms are explored in relation to this model, notably with clarifications whether they may or may not produce states that mimic endogenous schizophrenic states.\n\nOne of the older theories of mental health is one known as the diathesis-stress model. Its’ basic premise is that increased stress and increased vulnerability to stress through genetics (and probably prior experiences) can manifest in mental health problems. The endogenous opioid system may be involved in determining the valence of experiences, from euphoria, to the dysphoria of stress. Most interestingly, one of the most potent hallucinogens to have ever been found in nature is predominantly an opioid agonist. Specifically, Salvia Divinorum contains salvinorin A which is a kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonist and powerful hallucinogen. The kappa-opioid receptor system is implicated in the stress response and many of the KOR agonists induce very many symptoms of common mental health problems. Dynorphin is the endogenous agent that binds to the KOR system and may help in connecting pharmacology to the diathesis-stress model. At the deep end of the stress response may reside the psychotic state, dissociation, and eventually hallucinogenesis.\n\nThe dynorphins are a group of opioid neuropeptides that are like endorphins but in some sense opposite. Instead of producing effects like euphoria and reinforcement of reward (Roth-Deri, Green-Sadan, & Yadid 2008), the dynorphins induce effects like dysphoria and aversion conditioning (Land et al 2008; Al-Hasani et al 2015). While endorphins predominantly interact with the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) system, the dynorphins interact predominantly with the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) system. If endorphins are seen as a rewarding mechanism, the dynorphins can be viewed as a punishment (aversion) mechanism. Dynorphins seem to be a key component of the dysphoric component of stress and possibly even pain (Land et al 2008; Massaly et al 2019). Expectedly, the dynorphins seem to play a role in many dysphoric and stressful mental health problems including depression, anxiety, drug withdrawals, PTSD, and schizophrenia (Tejeda & Bonci 2019; Knoll & Carlezon 2010; Crowley et al 2016; Chavkin & Koob 2016; Rabellino et al 2018; Clark & Abi-Dargham 2019). The dynorphins seem to play a major endogenous role in fear conditioning and avoidance behaviors (Knoll et al 2011; Donahue et al 2015).\n\nDrugs that stimulate the KOR system are rarely used in medicine due to inducing many problematic effects such as psychosis, anxiety, dysphoria, depression, and hallucinations (White & Roth 2012; Coursey 1978). The infamous hallucinogen Salvia Divinorum appears to work through KOR agonism as its’ main mechanism (Butelman & Kreek, 2015). Many other KOR agonists are hallucinogenic as well, such as ketazocine and pentazocine, which has limited their use in medicine (White & Roth, 2012; Morris & Wallach, 2014; Coursey, 1978). Ketamine also stimulates this system, although it is not its’ main mechanism (Nemeth et al., 2010). It is even thought that acute KOR agonism and subsequent KOR desensitization are required for ketamine’s protracted antidepressant effects (Jacobson et al., 2020). On the other hand, KOR antagonists are found to be euphoric and antidepressant acutely (Jacobson, Browne, & Lucki, 2020). While KOR agonists may have some potential uses in the treatment of psychiatric problems, they often haven’t been favored in medical use due to their depressive and psychosis-like effects.\n\nSchizophrenia is a condition characterized by episodes of positive (hallucinations, delusions, paranoia) and negative symptoms (anhedonia, cognitive problems, memory issues). There is evidence that dynorphin may be useful to understanding schizophrenia. Dynorphin A was found to be elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of schizophrenics and the levels of dynorphin A correlated with symptom severity (Heikkilä, Rimón, & Ternius, 1990). A newer study found elevated serum KORs in schizophrenia which associated to all symptom dimensions (Moustafa et al., 2020). It is worth noting that another study found decreased dynorphin (1–8) (D 1–8) in the CSF of schizophrenics (Zhang et al., 1985). This might suggest a role for specific types of dynorphin in schizophrenia.\n\nThe proposed role of dynorphin/KOR in schizophrenia may be region-dependent, specifically, regions that are hyperdopaminergic in schizophrenia may also show elevated dynorphin/KORs. Another consideration is that there are differential mechanisms that converge on schizophrenic symptoms. Such regional specificity of increased KORs has been observed in a post-mortem study on cocaine overdose cases. The researchers observed double the KORs in the striatum of cocaine overdose victims (Mash & Staley, 1999). Most interestingly, they also observed that those who had delirious effects had elevated KORs in the amygdala. Since cocaine has been observed to induce psychotic symptoms (Tang, Martin, & Cotes, 2014), this is of particular interest. In this article, most focus is on the potential role of striatal and amygdalar dynorphin/KORs in cases of schizophrenia, although other regions are touched upon as well.\n\nDelusions may be partly mediated by the effects of affect on cognition. Specifically, one’s affect may amplify the salience of affect-congruent memories and perceptions. Reward processing is impaired in schizophrenia, with an observed diminished reward processing and intact aversion processing (Cheng et al., 2012; Strauss, Waltz, & Gold, 2014). Individuals with schizophrenia also appear to have a decreased density and availability of mu-opioid receptors (MORs), a receptor-type involved in reward processing (Ashok et al., 2019). This may suggest that dynorphin/KOR agonist signaling is functional, but not MOR agonist signaling, ultimately biasing perceptions towards aversive processing and interpretation, causing one to view the world through a lens of fear, pain, and threat. The negative affective state may induce memory biases that filter judgment towards threatening conclusions and paranoia (Lepage et al. 2007). Paranoia induced by cannabis appears to be “fully accounted for” by the negative affective state (Freeman et al, 2015), which is thought to be mediated by kappa-opioid receptor activity (Ghozland et al., 2002; Zimmer et al., 2001). In later sections, THC is explored. The negative affective state may bias recall of memories and cause one to form conclusions that are biased and absent of information that is key to non-delusional judgment. Dynorphin may play a role in this affect-mediated cognitive process via its’ role in dysphoria.\n\nThe striatum seems to be implicated in delusional and hallucinogenic processes. In a small study, the ventral striatum was found to have increased activity in those experiencing active delusions (Raij et al., 2018). The study found that dopamine activity in the striatum plays a role in the delusional process, which the authors argue is related to altered salience of stimuli. This altered salience of stimuli may be similar to the altered access to episodic memory during affective states, which is arguably a form of altered memory salience. Again, it may be that affect produces self-congruent amplifications of salience. In other words, a negative affect may enhance the salience of negatively affective memories and perceptions. An individual who feels threatened may look at the world with a confirmation bias to discover relevant threatening aspects of the world.\n\nHallucinations may stem from the impact of belief on perception and affect may mediate the strength of belief by promoting the development of delusions through the processes previously outlined. One study found that increased expectations during uncertainty were associated to hallucinations (Cassidy et al., 2018). The authors also found that this was linked to striatal dopamine.\n\nDelusions and hallucinations may be conditioned and involve mechanisms in the striatum and amygdala. Some research has found that auditory hallucinations can be conditioned (Powers, Mathys, & Corlett, 2017). The striatum is involved in conditioning (O’Doherty et al., 2004), so it may be that the salience of stimuli or memories are conditioned by prior experiences and our beliefs. More arousing or strongly valent experiences or beliefs may alter the conditioning of salience. The amygdala plays a role in arousal and valence (Anders et al., 2008) and has been linked to incentive saliency which the authors argued to involve opioid mechanisms (specifically mu-opioid receptors in this particular study) (Mahler & Berridge, 2012). Since KORs exist in the amygdala (Tejeda et al., 2015) and KORs/dynorphin play a role in fear processing and conditioning, KORs may similarly play a role in incentive saliency processes in the amygdala like MORs seem to. These processes may play a role in conditioned saliency and perceptual memory biases that may help explain delusions and hallucinations in schizophrenia.\n\nDissociation is often experienced by those with schizophrenia. Dissociation could be defined as subtraction of subjective experience (or potentially also function). This may occur as a muting of components of subjective experience on a particulate level (perceptions, empathy, feelings, sense of self, etc.). It is thought that trauma can induce dissociative disorders (Lanius et al., 2018). This may be because of the way attention to some stimuli are essentially “punished” by the traumatic experience. Attendance to empathy or certain feelings may cause suffering and escaping this may be protective to one’s feelings. One could also dissociate from external stimuli and become withdrawn into their imagination.\n\nIt is important to note that this idea is separate from affect-congruent saliency of stimuli. In this case, it may be that we turn away from certain kinds of undesirable stimuli because we are rewarded or negatively reinforced to do so.\n\nDynorphin could play a role in endogenous dissociative states, considering that salvinorin A, a dynorphin agonist, produces dissociative states. A recent review paper has explored evidence that dynorphin is a mechanism for trauma-induced dissociation (Lanius et al., 2018). Those with the dissociative disorder known as depersonalization have muted salience for emotional stimuli (Medford et al., 2006). Since dynorphin plays a role in aversion/fear conditioning, it may be involved in conditioned/learned dissociation from extreme stress. Specifically, dynorphin may be implicated in avoidance of attendance to aversive stimuli and may be negatively reinforcing due to the relief that non-attendance provides in the stressful situation. In the case of depersonalization, an individual may learn how to mute the emotional components of stimuli as a way to reduce stress.\n\nKOR agonism may suppress the salience of memories. Salvinorin A seems to cause a suppression of memory for one’s life during the experience. People often forget that they consumed a drug, forget who they are, and even that they are human. Salvinorin A might indiscriminately target KOR neurons, while endogenous dynorphin might target specific neurons based on contexts. For example, memory suppression that seems to occur from traumatic events might be a highly selective form of dissociation, meanwhile salvinorin A might suppress memories indiscriminately. It is possible that certain endogenous conditions cause dynorphin release that is poorly discriminate. This may be especially the case if one becomes hypersensitive to stress, which is explored in the diathesis stress kindling section later.\n\nThis memory suppression could change how we form conclusions about reality, as if we forget to account for information that we should be aware of. For example, the trauma victim may conclude that they have not been abused, when in fact they have. This may set the stage for delusional belief formation.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that individuals may develop tolerance to the subjective feeling of stress or dysphoria, while still maintaining their effects on the salience of memories or perceptions. In this sense, one may not subjectively notice their affect but it may still influence their perception and cognition. Chronic dysphoria may result in mostly behavioral effects such as the flat affect, anhedonia, and altered perception/thinking. I suspect that the subjective noticing of dysphoria is most prominent during the initial transition to the feeling, after which a tolerance to the subjective feeling of the affect develops and one loses the ability to notice their affect.\n\nThere have been a multitude of biopsychological hypotheses of schizophrenia over the years. This section explores the unification of the dopamine, glutamate, serotonin, and KOR hypotheses of schizophrenia. In the later sections, research on the diathesis stress model, social stress, drug-associated psychosis, and seizure-induced psychosis is explored.\n\nThe KOR antagonist buprenorphine was found to be acutely and potently antipsychotic in un-medicated psychotic subjects, with effects lasting about 4 hours before the psychotic symptoms returned (Schmauss, Yassouridis, & Emrich, 1987). Other KOR antagonists like naloxone and naltrexone have also been explored with some beneficial effects (Clark, Van Snellenberg, Lawson, & Abi-Dargham, 2020), though I would suggest that MOR antagonism may be pro-psychotic as well, since there is an observed decrease in the rates of schizophrenia among users of MOR agonists (Chiappelli, Chen, Hackman, & Hong, 2018) and due to the nature of the MOR system having almost diametrically opposed effects to the KOR system (Pan, 1998). Furthermore, KOR agonists are popularly known to be hallucinogenic (White & Roth, 2012; Morris & Wallach, 2014; Coursey, 1978) and produce some of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as anhedonia (Tejeda & Bonci, 2019). Dynorphin has been experimentally tested as a treatment for heroin addiction in humans, in which 25% of the participants experienced crawling hallucinations known as formication (Wen & Ho, 1982). This is interesting because the authors were not exactly testing to see if dynorphin would produce hallucinations, in fact they would hope it doesn’t because this could be a hindrance to the therapeutic potential of their experimental treatment for addiction.\n\nIt is important to consider that, even if endogenous schizophrenic symptoms are mediated by KOR agonism, using KOR agonists as an experimental animal model may not be sufficient. This is because endogenous KOR agonism is not arbitrarily stimulated, but instead is part of a larger context and cause-and-effect stream. As we will explore in the following sections, dopamine, glutamate, and other neurotransmitter activity may be an earlier step in the process and also contribute to the symptomology of schizophrenia too. KOR agonism alone may only partially mimic certain aspects of schizophrenia and be missing other more causal elements that alter the experience. In that sense, KOR agonism alone may produce an extracted or purified set of symptoms that aren’t character of the cocktail of symptoms and mechanisms implicated in endogenous schizophrenic states. As an example, later we will explore how stimulants may produce KOR-mediated hallucinations and psychotic effects, but obviously the subjective effects of stimulants differ greatly from those of salvinorin A. Individuals with schizophrenia are likely living a life that contains some or many of the things that can potentiate KOR-mediated hallucinations, which also produce many other effects than pure salvinorin A alone would. It is likely that a dopamine-induced KOR-mediated hallucinatory state is subjectively different than a simple KOR-mediated hallucinatory state.\n\nStimulant drugs are known to produce psychotic effects, often with repeated use rather than acutely, except in those who have been previously sensitized or have already experienced psychotic effects in the past (Grant et al., 2012; Ujike, 2002). This has helped to contribute to the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia along with dopamine receptor antagonists, known as antipsychotic drugs. Stimulant drugs like amphetamine or cocaine commonly work by stimulating dopamine activity. One dopamine receptor of particular interest is the D1 receptor, which actually stimulates dynorphin increases in the striatum (Solís et al 2021; Hanson et al., 1995; Steiner & Gerfen, 1995). Cocaine, alcohol, nicotine, methamphetamine, and morphine all produce an increase of dynorphin in the striatum after use (Shippenberg, Zapata, & Chefer, 2007; Isola et al 2009; Hanson et al 1988; Nylander et al 1995). Dynorphin is often used to explain the withdrawal symptoms of drugs as well as playing a crucial role in the development of addictions (Bruijnzeel, 2009; Chavkin & Koob, 2016). This connection of dopamine to KOR activity provides a possible mechanism for stimulant-induced psychotic effects, which usually don’t show up on the immediate effect of the drug (except in those previously sensitized), but often after repeated use (Grant et al., 2012; Ujike, 2002). Meanwhile, KOR agonists are acutely psychotic and hallucinogenic.\n\nThe dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia often focuses on D2 receptor hyperactivity and KOR agonism can potentiate the effects of D2 receptor agonism (Escobar et al., 2017). This may help to explain how D2 receptor hyperactivity becomes prominent in schizophrenics. In animals, knockout of D2 receptors prevents the rise in dynorphin in the striatum induced by D1 receptor stimulation (Solís et al 2021). D1 and D2 heteromers localize in dynorphin dense neurons in the striatum. The formation of these heteromer complexes between D1 and D2 in dynorphin neurons is promoted by amphetamine and exists in an elevated state in schizophrenics as well (Perreault et al 2010). It isn’t clear how, but this indicates that D2 receptor activity may somehow facilitate this dynorphin release. It may be the co-agonism of D1 and D2 simultaneously that induces dynorphin release, although this is something that warrants further exploration.\n\nKOR agonism in the striatum may help explain how hallucinations occur in schizophrenia. Dopamine in the striatum has been implicated in hallucinations (Schmack et al., 2021; Cassidy et al., 2018). Dopamine-mediated hallucinations may occur via dopamine-induced dynorphin activity, possibly via the upregulation of these D1-D2 heteromers on dynorphinergic neurons in the striatum. Since stimulants often seem to require some kind of sensitization process in order to induce hallucinations and dynorphin agonist drugs produce strong hallucinogenic effects acutely, the hallucinations caused by dopamine might be related to dynorphin instead. During periods where dopamine activity peaks strongly, we may observe a consequential peak of dynorphin activity that is strong enough to produce positive symptoms like hallucinations and delusions. When this dopamine activity declines, dynorphin activity may also subsequently dip, but still produce negative symptoms like anhedonia, due to excessively diminished dopamine activity, especially in the prefrontal cortex.\n\nMy hypothesis is that the striatum plays a role in managing whether perceptions and thoughts are rewarded or punished (likely through conditioned salience), then facilitating perceptions and thoughts that are successful. As an example, when a child is new to the world, they may have not yet calibrated their visual perception. The erroneous perceptions may lead to failures of reaching goals, such as bumping into a wall because it was closer than expected. Spatial acuity may be conditioned by rewards when we successfully reach goals that we are aiming for. When we fail, perception may be primed for elimination by suppression of the salience of a representation or stimuli. Visual perceptions may stem from reward/aversion-conditioning that tells the brain which perceptual predictions were useful or problematic. Disruptions in detecting reward/aversion may then disrupt perceptual processing as well.\n\nBlocking out memories that contradict a rewarding belief might be negatively reinforcing. If perceiving or thinking something is aversive or punishing, dissociation may suppress the salience of stimuli that lead to the perception or thought. The relief induced by this dissociation could become negatively reinforcing. Dopamine might reinforce delusional ideas and hallucinations, while dynorphins may subtract from stimuli that would ordinarily prevent such delusional or hallucinatory thoughts and perceptions from arising. Dynorphin may suppress information that is critical for developing accurate perceptions or thoughts. Strange hallucinations may also stem from delusional beliefs.\n\nThere is a distinction between dissociating from harmful stimuli to be rewarded and being rewarded for avoiding harmful stimuli via successful anticipation. Affect-congruent saliency may especially play a role in the avoidance of anticipated harmful stimuli, while actively harmful information, such as information that contradicts your belief in a way that leads you to suffer, is dissociated from or loses its’ saliency. In both of these cases, avoidance of harm is shared. One strategy is to manipulate the environment to avoid harm and the other is to dissociate as if the harm is not occurring. There may then be a mix of becoming hypersensitive to detecting threatening stimuli and also dissociation to protect oneself from threats.\n\nIt is important to note that salvia divinorum is acutely hallucinogenic and likely does not seem to rely on conditioned responses. Though, repeated salvia use might induce conditioned responses hypothetically. Acute hallucination and delusion might come from suddenly suppressed internal or external stimuli that leads to an altered view of reality. Important stimuli that inform our conclusions and perceptions of reality could go missing and allow for conclusions and perceptions that contradict the missing information. It may be that salvia strongly disrupts our conditioned salience or even enhances our reaction to already conditioned stimuli. Undergoing repeated episodes of this might lead to conditioned responses.\n\nAnother popular hypothesis for schizophrenia proposes a major role of the neurotransmitter glutamate, specifically an involvement of NMDA receptor hypoactivity (Moghaddam & Javitt, 2012). This led to the use of NMDA receptor antagonists in the study of an animal model of schizophrenia. KOR agonism appears to suppress glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and in a pathway between medial prefrontal cortex and the basolateral amygdala (Tejeda et al., 2013; Hjelmstad & Fields, 2003; Tejeda et al., 2015). Besides producing anti-glutamatergic effects through KOR agonism, dynorphin has also been shown to directly block glutamate NMDA receptors (Chen, Gu, & Huang, 1995). This effect seems to depend on extracellular glycine levels, which determine whether dynorphin will potentiate NMDA-receptor-mediated excitotoxicity or suppress NMDA receptor activity (Zhang et al., 1997). Dynorphin has been found to inhibit neuroplasticity in the hippocampus of animals (Xu et al., 2021; Terman, Wagner, & Chavkin, 1994), something that is also thought to play a role in schizophrenia (Stephan, Baldeweg, & Friston, 2006; Stephan, Friston, & Frith, 2009). This makes sense as NMDA receptors are the key mechanism for certain types of plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (Stephan, Baldeweg, & Friston, 2006).\n\nSo, as dopamine activity increases, dynorphin releases which reduces glutamate function through KOR and NMDA receptor inhibition. High activity of glutamate may also play a role in the dynorphin release, as it was mentioned above that the NMDA receptor seems to play a collaborator role along with dopamine D1 receptors in the release of the peptide.\n\nThe diathesis stress model proposes that stressful experiences produce a vulnerability to schizophrenic symptoms (Jones & Fernyhough, 2007). An older neural rendition of the diathesis stress model focused on cortisol and the stress response (Walker & Diforio, 1997). In this current paper, the focus is on dynorphin since it is part of the stress response and targets the same mechanisms that KOR agonistic hallucinogens stimulate to produce hallucinogenesis. This tweak to the model may better explain stress-related symptoms and schizophrenia.\n\nGeneral support of the diathesis stress model comes from research showing that those with schizophrenia have often had trauma (Larsson et al., 2013; Lommen & Restifo, 2009; Lysaker & LaRocco, 2008). As much as 82% of those diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders reported experiencing childhood trauma, particularly emotional neglect (Larsson et al., 2013). Other support for the model comes from the observation of stress-induced schizophrenia symptoms. One case study has explored 3 soldiers’ stress-induced hallucinations, which occurred without other psychopathology (Spivak et al., 1992). The soldiers’ symptoms were both acute and transient. A small study interviewing severe trauma survivors found that subjects experienced hallucinogenic effects from their stressful events, particularly those who experienced life-threatening situations and isolation (Siegel, 1984).\n\nThe diathesis stress model may be explained partly by the dynorphinergic effects of stress. In essence, some level of stress may produce hallucinogenic or psychotomimetic effects through dynorphin activity, possibly mimicking the effects of the KOR agonist hallucinogenic drugs like Salvia, Pentazocine, Ketazocine, and Ketamine. Repeated stress events may induce plasticity in the KOR system that eventually upregulates its’ function and sensitivity (Knoll et al., 2011), biasing one to find the dysphoric, stressful, and phobic elements of life as a protective mechanism against threatening environments. While it is only anecdotal, there have been reports that salvinorin A produces “reverse tolerance” in which taking the drug repeatedly produces an increasingly potentiated hallucinogenic response. Traumatic and stressful events may also be capable of a similar potentiation mechanism and this may underlie the diathesis stress model. We could term this phenomenon stress kindling. The term kindling usually refers to epileptogenesis that occurs from repeated stimulation of the brain or from repeated withdrawals from benzodiazepine sedatives. The idea is that smaller levels of stimulation produce a potentiated response later, in essence, reverse tolerance. This isn’t to say that stress always results in a kindling effect, but it may be a possible effect. Stress kindling may be a kind of aversion sensitization, similar to how there is reward sensitization that is often explored in addiction research.\n\nTo give an example of how stress sensitization may work, consider alcohol. Alcohol appears to induce fear and aversion sensitization via activation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray (Cabral et al., 2006). KOR agonism in this same brain region induces panic effects, while blocking KOR in this region has anti-panic effects (Maraschin et al., 2017). This may occur due to the stress of withdrawals, which may induce lasting sensitivity to KOR responses. Repeated alcohol use has been observed to induce plasticity in the KOR system, upregulating the dynorphin/KOR system (Sirohi, Bakalkin, & Walker, 2012), which supports this idea. In summary, repeated stress of alcohol withdrawal may sensitize aversion and fear responses via plasticity of the KOR system in the dorsal periaqueductal gray. This may generalize to many forms of stress, such as bullying, drugs, sleep loss, and traumatic events. Social stress and drug use are further explored in the following sections.\n\nImaginably, frequent or strongly negative experiences are expected to shape our judgment. If one has been in multiple car accidents, a fear of driving may emerge. Negative and positive life events may shape how negative or positive we expect life to be. Having strong or many negative events could lead one to anticipate more negative events, thus biasing one’s judgment towards expecting negative events. We anticipate a future that is derived from our understanding of our past and the world as we have experienced it. Events involving intentional harm towards an individual, such as parental betrayal and peer bullying may prime an individual to distrust people or worry about future harmful behaviors. Paranoia may often stem from the expectation or bias that other people intend to harm oneself. Those with schizophrenia may often have a genetic predisposition either to view experiences as negative or to have negative experiences. They may also be predisposed to discount positive experiences. Early life events may particularly influence the development of general distrust in people, since children have a smaller sample of normal human behavior. Trust-breaking events and betrayal may lead to further social avoidance and problems developing trusted bonds with peers. This may cause social conflict, isolation, and a failure to conform to social norms, beliefs, and other memetically-transferred behaviors, specifically because an individual would be less exposed to such memes if they are asocial.\n\nSocial stress is particularly relevant to both schizophrenia and the diathesis stress model and the effects of social stress may be partly mediated by endogenous opioid mechanisms.\n\nIndividuals with schizophrenia very often face social issues and this may produce stress responses that lead to KOR-mediated symptoms. The social issues in schizophrenia often precede the onset of schizophrenic symptoms (Ballon, Kaur, Marks, & Cadenhead, 2007). One study found that children of those with schizophrenia frequently had poor social adjustment, being unpopular with peers (Hans et al., 2000). Number of friends is negatively correlated to symptom severity in schizophrenia (Giacco et al., 2012). Experimental induction of loneliness seems to induce paranoia, while reducing loneliness decreases paranoia, effects that were moderated by proneness to psychosis (Lamster et al., 2017). Social isolation in childhood is linked to a potentiated KOR system in later life (Karkhanis, Rose, Weiner, & Jones, 2016). Social deprivation through solitary confinement also appears to produce nearly all symptoms of schizophrenia (Grassian & Friedman, 1986). This would suggest that negative social experience or social deprivation induces stress that may facilitate symptoms of schizophrenia and this may be in part due to dynorpinergic mechanisms.\n\nDue to noticing trends in the schizophrenic population, namely that those who generally face more prejudice experience schizophrenia more commonly, a social defeat hypothesis of schizophrenia was once proposed (Selten, Van Der Ven, Rutten, & Cantor-Graae, 2013). This is surprisingly corroborated by dynorphin research in animals. In the animal models of social defeat, dynorphin activity is increased and seems to determine whether the animal becomes defeated or expresses resilience (Bérubé, Laforest, Bhatnagar, & Drolet, 2013). Further studies indicated that dynorphins role during social defeat is primarily in acute social defeat stress responses (Donahue et al 2015). In humans, social status is negatively correlated with KOR density, specifically in areas that process reward and aversion (Matuskey et al., 2012). Opioid neurotransmission is thought to play a role in social reward processing in humans (Loseth et al 2014; Nummenmaa et al 2018; Manninin et al 2017; Trezza et al 2011). It is possible that social punishment or aversive experience is mediated by dynorphinergic opioid activity. This would fit with dynorphin’s more general role in stress and aversion. Social defeat (abuse, bullying, isolation, rejection) in humans may stimulate dynorphinergic aversive processing that may elevate the risk of developing dynorphinergic hallucinogenic and cognitive effects.\n\nParanoia and persecutory delusions may develop from conditioned salience of threatening stimuli due to repeated negative social experiences like being bullied (actual persecution).\n\nA more recent paper argued that the social defeat hypothesis may have problems with reverse causality (Selten, van Os, & Cantor‐Graae, 2016). Specifically, that schizophrenia may cause low social status. Rather than it being one hypothesis or the other, it may be both. Being born with genes associated to schizophrenia may both increase the risk for social defeat and social defeat may increase the risk of worsening symptoms. This seems clear when observing the benefits that socializing appears to have in those with schizophrenia. Those with schizophrenia may also have genes that make them more susceptible to the negative effects of social defeat and stress-induced symptoms like hallucinations. They may also have genes that cause them to face prejudice or defeat as well, making it more likely that the person will experience trauma or stress in their lifetime.\n\nChallenging of one’s beliefs can be stressful. This is especially true when the social cost for having a “bad” belief is high. We often tend to shame people for believing the wrong things or disagreeing with our beliefs. An implicit assumption that often accompanies this is that the wrong believer is stupid or insane. In essence, one is harmed for holding the belief. This often drives people to avoid believing ideas that go against their subculture, although in some cases a person can protect themselves from this pattern of dissent by trying harder to prove that they are not stupid or insane. One may then conclude that the opposition is the stupid or insane one.\n\nSchizophrenia and drug addiction very frequently coincide. This may be due to shared genetic liability between schizophrenia and drug use (Pasman et al., 2018) and it may also be due to drug use increasing the risk of schizophrenic symptoms (Howes et al., 2004). Dynorphin and the KOR system may help explain this connection. Dynorphin has been implicated in addiction, likely contributing to withdrawal symptoms and aversion that occurs when ceasing drug use (Bruijnzeel, 2009; Chavkin & Koob, 2016). Many commonly used drugs lead to enhanced dynorphin signaling via dopaminergic mechanisms. A rise in dynorphinergic activity has been observed as a consequence of the use of cocaine, alcohol, nicotine, methamphetamine, and morphine (Shippenberg, Zapata, & Chefer, 2007; Isola et al 2009; Hanson et al 1988; Nylander et al 1995). Dynorphin may even be implicated in food addiction (Karkhanis, Holleran, & Jones, 2017). As mentioned earlier, this dynorphin activity is likely induced by D1 receptor stimulation (Solís et al 2021; Hanson et al., 1995; Steiner & Gerfen, 1995). Normally, this dynorphin release may curb excess dopamine activity via dopamine release inhibition (Tejeda & Bonci, 2019), but when the dopaminergic drug wears off, dynorphin may remain elevated and produce dysphoric antidopaminergic symptoms such as anhedonia (Chavkin & Koob, 2016).\n\nThe use of stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine has been associated with psychotic symptoms (Curran, Byrappa, & McBride, 2004) and have contributed to ideas like the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia (Baumeister & Francis, 2002). As mentioned before, amphetamine users and schizophrenics have elevated D1-D2 heteromers located on dynorphin dense neurons (Perreault et al 2010), which may contribute to psychotic symptoms that emerge from dopamine activity via the release of dynorphin. The study by Perreault and colleagues also suggests that becoming addicted to dopaminergic drugs (at least amphetamine) may lead to physiological changes that resemble those observed in schizophrenic patients and that also line up with the same mechanisms stimulated by the hallucinogenic drug salvinorin A.\n\nIt is important to note that nicotine use among schizophrenics is exceedingly high, with some studies suggesting as much as 80% of those diagnosed with the condition use the drug, which has often been explained as self-medication (Chambers, 2009). The self-medication hypothesis may be partially true, but we cannot neglect the possibility that nicotine is contributing to the symptoms as well. Some researchers have actually written about this possibility, noting that schizophrenics do not self-medicate with antipsychotic drugs, but in fact they often will refuse their antipsychotic medication likely because of their demotivating and flattening effects (Quigley & MacCabe, 2019; Juckel, 2016).\n\nDrugs like nicotine may be ubiquitously desired by humans due to their rewarding and motivating effects. Those with schizophrenia may suffer from insufficiency of reward and motivation at baseline, possibly in relation to the decreased MOR receptor density and availability mentioned earlier, thus they may be driven to consume drugs that improve motivation and give a sense of reward more than those without schizophrenia. When these drugs are consumed, including nicotine, they may increase the risk for psychotic states via enhanced dynorphinergic signaling. In essence, those with schizophrenia may be more prone to seek out self-medication for the negative affective state but at the cost of risking more symptoms after tolerance and potentially psychosis eventually. These rewarding and motivating drugs may acutely resolve the diminished reward capacity in schizophrenia, but after tolerance sets in, they may experience elevated problems, particularly when the drug wears off and their reward capacity sinks below baseline, inducing a stronger bias towards threatening memories and stimuli. Hallucinations may stem from enhanced dynorphin signaling, potentially during the peak of dopamine spikes that induce dynorphin release via D1-NMDAr heteromers which is possibly facilitated by D2 receptor stimulation as well.\n\nInterestingly, opioid (MOR agonist) use was found to be much less in those diagnosed with schizophrenia than those with other diagnoses, while alcohol, cocaine, and cannabis use was more frequent in schizophrenia than those with other diagnoses (Chiappelli, Chen, Hackman, & Hong, 2018). Since MOR agonism has effects that are oppositional to KOR agonism (Pan, 1998), MOR agonists might treat schizophrenia to some degree or prevent diagnosis. Meanwhile, alcohol, cocaine, and cannabis might facilitate diagnosis by amplifying symptoms to the point of psychosis, leading to hospitalization and eventually diagnosis.\n\nSeizures were briefly mentioned in the context of kindling earlier and interestingly, seizures can invoke psychotic episodes. Some researchers have noted that dynorphin may help explain this tendency for seizures to bring on psychotic effects (Bortolato & Solbrig, 2007). Dynorphin seems to be a potent anticonvulsant and releases during seizures. This makes sense, as NMDA receptor hyperactivity and general glutamate hyperactivity is linked to seizure episodes (Bausch, He, & Dong, 2010) and dynorphin is capable of stopping both of these functions (Bortolato & Solbrig, 2007). The role of D1 receptors in producing a dynorphin response from stimulants also seemed to involve not only D1 but also NMDA receptor activation (Hanson et al., 1995), so this may partly be due to a role of dynorphin to stop excitotoxic and epileptic events that are related to NMDA receptor hyperactivity. Stimulants are also known to reduce the seizure threshold (Sheth & Samaniego, 2008; Hanson et al., 1999), possibly by stimulating mechanisms like NMDA receptors (often times indirectly).\n\nThe role of dynorphin targeting effects in psychedelic states, especially the kind induced by the so called classic psychedelics (serotonergic in nature; LSD, Psilocybin, MDMA), is likely to be controversial. It has been observed that LSD, both in acute and chronic dosing, suppressed the behavioral effects of KOR agonism (Sakloth et al., 2019). There are also mechanisms that may help in explaining this: LSD binds to 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors as a partial agonist.\n\n5HT1a serotonergic receptors may play a role in schizophrenic symptomology via dynorphin modulation and agonists may provide therapeutic value. 5HT1a receptor agonism is able to diminish the increase of dynorphin that occurs in response to L-Dopa, a dopaminergic substance (Tomiyama et al., 2005). In line with this, 5HT1a receptor agonism has been suggested to have antipsychotic effects, possibly by enhancing cognition and restoring neurogenesis (Schreiber & Newman-Tancredi, 2014). 5HT1a receptor agonism is thought to be antidepressant and induce activity of endogenous MOR agonists (Navinés et al., 2008), which might work to stabilize negative affect-mediated symptoms like memory biases and delusions.\n\n5HT1a receptors in the amygdala and neighboring regions may be implicated in schizophrenia. 5HT1a agonism reduces aversion processing in the periaqueductal gray (Nogueira & Graeff, 1995). This brain region works with the amygdala in fear learning (Keifer Jr, Hurt, Ressler, & Marvar, 2015), something that dynorphin plays a role in (Knoll et al., 2011). From a small study, individuals with schizophrenia appear to have a hyperactivity of the amygdala (Pinkham et al., 2015). In tasks that measure fearful face processing, schizophrenics had overactivation of the amygdala even when presented neutral (non-fearful) stimuli (Hall et al., 2008; Dugré, Bitar, Dumais, & Potvin, 2019), suggesting a hyperactive fear-processing system. Schizophrenics also seem to have decreased 5HT1a receptor binding in the amygdala (Yasuno et al., 2014), which tsuggest unchecked fear/aversion processing and learning. This could help explain symptoms like paranoia. This decrease in 5HT1a receptor binding may allow dynorphin to accumulate, producing dysphoric, dissociative, and hallucinogenic effects that resemble the dynorphin-mimetic drug salvia.\n\nThe reduction of 5HT1a binding in schizophrenia may help explain the impairment of neuroplasticity (Balu & Coyle, 2011), as well as aberrant neurogenesis thought to be implicated in schizophrenia (Weissleder, North, & Weickert, 2019), since 5HT1a receptor agonism appears to induce neurogenesis (Borroto-Escuela et al., 2015; Klempin et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2016; Schreiber & Newman-Tancredi, 2014) and neuroplasticity (Albert & Vahid-Ansari, 2019; Aguiar et al., 2020). Dynorphin is also known to have antiplastic effects (Polter et al., 2014; Huge et al., 2009; Terman, Wagner, & Chavkin, 1994), so the inhibition of dynorphin by 5HT1a receptor agonism may help restore the plasticity that is observed to be diminished in schizophrenics as well. The schizophrenic’s loss of 5HT1a receptor function may allow an antiplastic state to emerge via disinhibited dynorphin activity and 5HT1a receptor agonism may help to inhibit antiplastic mechanisms and improve function in schizophrenia.\n\nSome important notes: those with schizophrenia may have increased binding of 5HT1a receptors in the prefrontal cortex (Burnet, Eastwood, & Harrison, 1997).\n\nDifferences in 5HT2a receptor density and binding may exist in schizophrenia and have implications for learning and memory. A meta-analysis and systematic review from 2014 found reduced binding of the 5HT2a receptor in post-mortem studies on schizophrenic patients and in molecular imaging studies in unmedicated schizophrenics, although the studies analyzed in this paper often had mixed and contradicting results (Selvaraj, Arnone, Cappai, & Howes, 2014). Reduced 5HT2a receptor binding has been associated with reduced cognitive ability in humans (Hasselbalch et al., 2008), which might help in explaining reduced cognitive ability in schizophrenic patients. Schizophrenics also appear to show reduced responsiveness to DMT and LSD in very old studies (Cholden, Kurland, & Savage, 1955; Böszörményi, 1958), supporting the observation of reduced binding. The date these studies were published aligns very closely to the earlier uses of the first antipsychotic drugs and it is unclear whether these patients were medicated. Since the results of the studies seem counterintuitive, one would expect that the authors considered the possibility that antipsychotic medication could also be antipsychedelic as well. Since there is no mention of this as an explanation for their observations, this could suggest the patients were not medicated with antipsychotics.\n\nThis receptor has been argued to be the ‘main’ mechanism of the serotonergic psychedelic drugs and may modulate KOR activity. It is thought that the receptor produces its’ psychedelic effects by suppressing glutamate mGlur2 receptor binding which results in a disinhibition of glutamate release, and thus a subsequent increase in glutamate activity (Delille et al., 2012). Besides LSD suppressing the behavioral effects of KOR agonism, there is evidence that 5HT2a receptors alter the effects of the KOR/dynorphin system. Blockade of 5HT2a receptors induces potentiation of the KOR activity of morphine (Peiró et al., 2011). Presumably, activity at 5HT2a receptors may then attenuate KOR activity. The 5HT2a receptors have also been implicated in anti-aversive effects in the periaqueductal gray (Nogueira & Graeff, 1995). This might be due to an interaction between 5HT2a receptors and the dynorphin/KOR system.\n\nThere are a few speculations that could be made as to the possible anti-dynorphin mechanisms of 5HT2a receptors. One is the induced release of acetylcholine in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (Nair & Gudelsky, 2004), which may promote agonism of the nAch alpha7 receptor, which suppresses dynorphin release from microglia (Ji et al., 2019). Interestingly, there is some (weak) evidence that mGlur2 stimulation facilitates KOR activity (Liu et al., 2017), though this seems still unclear as the researchers were studying diestrus. If this is true, then inhibition of mGlur2 via 5HT2a receptor agonism may suppress the dynorphin activity mediated by mGlur2 agonism. These mechanisms may be a good place to look 5HT2a receptor and dynorphin system interactions in future research.\n\nIt is possible that 5HT2a receptors are antidynorphinergic similarly to 5HT1a receptors, although it is less clear in this case. There is a section further down titled “Do Psychedelics Promote KOR Activity?” that explores the opposing argument, that 5HT2a receptor agonism may actually enhance KOR activity.\n\nSince dynorphin may play a role in learning and memory impairments and since schizophrenia involves learning and memory impairments, it is worth exploring the role of 5HT2a receptors in learning and memory.\n\nThere is evidence that drugs targeting 5HT2a receptors enhance learning and memory (Zhang & Stackman, 2015; Morales-Garcia et al., 2020; Barre et al., 2016), though there is also evidence that psilocin can impair learning and even acquisition at higher doses (Rambousek, Palenicek, Vales, & Stuchlik 2014). 5HT2a receptor agonists have been observed to enhance reversal learning in both animals (King, Martin, & Melville, 1974) and possibly humans (preprint experimental study) (Kanen et al., 2021). The 5HT2a receptor has been purported to play a role in plasticity and neurogenesis (enhanced in neocortex, inhibited in hippocampus) (Barre et al., 2016; Vaidya, Marek, Aghajanian, & Duman, 1997). These patterns of learning and plasticity are significant as schizophrenics show impairment in these areas, which could be explained by their reduced receptor counts. Unmedicated schizophrenics have impaired reversal learning (Schlagenhauf et al., 2014). These individuals also show impaired learning and memory (Diwadkar et al., 2008), and seem to have seem to have impaired plasticity and neurogenesis (Hall et al., 2015; Daskalakis, Christensen, Fitzgerald, & Chen, 2008; Stephan, Baldeweg, & Friston, 2006; Stephan, Friston, & Frith, 2009; Reif, Schmitt, Fritzen, & Lesch, 2007).\n\nAn important note: 5HT2 receptor agonism seems to oppose neurogenesis induced by 5HT1a receptor agonism (Klempin et al., 2010). This might suggest that the neurogenesis enhancing effects of psychedelics are related to 5HT1a receptor agonism rather than 5HT2 receptor agonism. Interestingly, there is also evidence that 5HT1a receptor antagonism potentiates the subjective psychedelic effects of DMT, a 5HT2a agonizing psychedelic (Barker, 2018). The neurogenesis topic is likely more complicated than it seems, so 5HT2a receptors may still play an important role. The study finding that 5HT2 receptor agonism decreases neurogenesis induced by 5HT1a receptors also found that 5HT2 receptor agonism promotes cell differentiation (Klempin et al., 2010), so it may play an important and useful role here as well. This study also didn’t distinguish 5HT2a and 5HT2c unfortunately.\n\nIt is even possible that some of the popularly known psychedelic effects are due to KOR-mediated effects at higher doses. While the low doses of psychedelics seem to produce an enhanced connection to reality, the senses, and the mind, on high doses of psychedelics people begin to dissociate away from reality (consider the DMT breakthrough, which appears very dissociative). The KOR agonists seem to generally disconnect one from reality dose-dependently, without the enhancement phase. Psychedelics may emulate the dynamics of seizures, where first an increase of sensation or some aspect of experience occurs, then a depression and disconnection occurs afterward as dynorphins flood into the brain to compensate for excess glutamate or dopamine activity. Besides this hypothesis, there are also mechanisms explored below that could underlie distinct psychotic or non-psychotic states\n\nAnother possibility is that 5HT2a receptor agonism actually promotes either KOR or dissociative (NMDAr antagonist) mechanisms under certain conditions. As mentioned previously, 5HT1a antagonists enhance the subjective effects of DMT. DMT itself is a 5HT1a, 5HT2a, and 5HT2c receptor agonist (Barker 2018). Since the agonism of the 5HT1a receptor was found to suppress increases of dynorphin due to dopamine D1 receptor stimulation (Tomiyama et al 2005) and antagonists of 5HT1a receptors potentiate the subjective effects of DMT in humans (Barker 2018), it is possible that blocking 5HT1a receptors is facilitating dynorphin release via another mechanism like 5HT2a. 5HT1a receptor antagonists also facilitate NMDA receptor inhibition via serotonin agonism at 5HT2a receptors, mimicking the 5HT2a receptor partial agonists studied (Arvonav et al 1999). These together suggest two possibly distinct (although they could be convergent) mechanisms underlying the “intensity” of subjective effects on psychedelics.\n\nIt is possible that 5HT2a receptors promote dynorphin release by enhancing D2 receptors. The increase of dynorphin via D1 receptor stimulation seems to rely on the presence of the D2 receptor and fails in D2 receptor knockout animals (Solís et al 2021). As mentioned before, D1-D2 heteromers colocalize on dynorphin neurons in a high affinity state in amphetamine abusers and schizophrenics (Perreault et al 2010), suggesting the cluster of these mechanisms may drive psychotic-like effects perhaps via potentiated KOR activity and NMDA receptor inhibition. 5HT2a receptors potentiate D2 receptor activity (Borroto-Escuela et al 2014), which might actually increase dynorphin release. This may suggest that 5HT2a receptor agonism is suppressing NMDA receptor activity by enhancing dynorphin release, although this is unclear still and would need to be explored in further research. From this research it does seem that 5HT2a receptor agonism has differential effects on NMDA receptors depending on 5HT1a receptor activity.\n\nClearly there are aversive and even frightening effects that can occur with the use of psychedelic drugs. This might be explainable partly by 5HT2c receptor binding. Dynorphin mRNA colocalizes strongly in 5HT2c dense neurons, while it was found lowest in the 5HT2a receptor dense neurons (Ward & Dorsa, 1996). 5HT2c agonism seems to facilitate CRF activity (Heisler et al., 2007) and CRF appears to induce dynorphin activity as part of the stress-response cascade (Bruchas, Land, & Chavkin, 2010). Both CRF and dynorphin are cofactors for the aversive effects of stress (Land et al 2008). This makes some sense, considering that 5HT2c receptors have been implicated in anxious responses to serotonergic drugs (Burghardt et al., 2007). Increasing the density of 5HT2c receptors in animals produces sensitivity to developing PTSD-like behavior (Règue et al., 2019). Though the connection between 5HT2c receptors and anxious reactions seems complicated, as it sometimes seems to produce an anti-phobic reaction (Jenck et al., 1998). It seems to depend on whether the anxious stimuli is a conditioned one or an unconditioned one. The conditioned anxious stimuli are enhanced while the unconditioned anxious stimuli are diminished (Mora, Netto, & Graeff, 1997). Though, it isn’t clear if that is really the case.\n\nImportant note: 5HT1a, 5HT2a, and 5HT2c all appear to increase CRF synthesis (Jørgensen et al., 2002), which might mean that 5HT2c isn’t especially CRF facilitating over the other serotonin receptor subtypes. Although the other receptor subtypes seem to be anti-aversive and the 5HT1a receptor seems to suppress dynorphin activity, so they may not all induce anxiety. 5HT2a receptors do seem to produce anxiety-like responses in animals (Weisstaub et al., 2006). Another study found that blockade of 5HT2a receptors increases CRF and the authors suggested that 5HT2a receptors may downregulate CRF (Nonogaki, Nozue, & Oka, 2006). It could be that the 5HT2a receptor’s effect is dependent on the state of 5HT1a receptors similarly to the case of 5HT2a receptor’s effects on NMDA receptors described earlier.\n\nThe cannabinoid known as THC is used by as much as 25% of schizophrenics have been diagnosed with cannabis use disorder at some point (Koskinen et al., 2010). THC appears to produce more classically schizophrenic effects, such as hearing voices, conspiratorial thinking, paranoia, and dissociation (PsychonautWiki). Interestingly, THC and other CB1 agonists actually reduce the commonly studied head twitch response that animals have when ingesting psychedelics (Darmani, 2001). Darmani also notes that CB1 antagonists induce a head twitch response, even without application of a psychedelic drug. This head twitch response has been associated especially to 5HT2a receptors, though 5HT2c may have some modulatory role (Canal & Morgan, 2012). This is significant because it suggests that THC and CB1 agonism generally may have anti-5HT2a effects. There is a study claiming that chronic use of THC enhances hallucinogenic signaling of 5HT2a receptors through heteromeric processes between CB1 and 5HT2a receptors (Ibarra-Lecue et al., 2018). This may not apply to acute use of THC. Usually, chronic use of LSD or similar psychedelics does not produce an enhancement of 5HT2a receptor mediated effects, they actually downregulate the receptors (Buchborn, Schröder, Höllt, & Grecksch, 2014). So THC may produce such an upregulation by inhibiting 5HT2a receptor activity through some mechanism, likely suppression via heteromeric processes, since 5HT2a receptors and CB1 receptors form heteromers. One complication of this idea is that users of psychedelics report a great potentiation when adding THC to a psychedelic trip. This potentiation may stem from other mechanisms besides facilitation of 5HT2a receptor agonism, such as alterations to GABA or glutamate release.\n\nTHC is also observed to induce dynorphin A (Mason Jr, Lowe, & Welch, 1999) and this induction of dynorphin seems to be necessary for THC-induced aversion, as mice lacking dynorphin do not experience THC induced aversion like normal animals (Zimmer et al., 2001). The euphoric effects of THC seem to be mediated by MOR agonism while the dysphoric effects seem to be mediated by KOR agonism (Ghozland et al., 2002). THC’s induction of paranoia seems to be strongly tied to negative affect induction (Freeman et al., 2015), which seems to be mediated by dynorphin release. THC may produce its’ hallucinogenic effects through indirect KOR stimulation rather than 5HT2a receptors. The reduction of 5HT2a receptor mediated effects by THC may potentiate KOR activity like what is observed in 5HT2a receptor antagonists. This may also mimic the reduced 5HT2a receptor binding observed in schizophrenics.\n\nThis project will continue to expand from here.\n\nIf you found this enjoyable, consider joining the Patreon!

    "description": "My first time visiting New Zealand was a solo trip. I made mistakes booking the TranzAlpine train and planning activities that cost me time and money.",
    "fullText": "Even after traveling the world solo for 10 years, I still make mistakes when visiting new destinations.\n\nBefore my first trip to New Zealand, I felt prepared: I had years of travel experience, solid research skills, an innate understanding of Polynesian culture from my roots in Hawaii, and even a local contact in Auckland.\n\nBut from common slip-ups like miscalculating timing to bigger missteps like booking non-refundable tickets for weather-dependent activities, I managed to get plenty wrong along the way.\n\nHere are some of the biggest mistakes I made during my six weeks in New Zealand — and how you can hopefully avoid them.\n\nI packed my itinerary with excursions, but didn't plan all of them well.\n\nFor example, my day trip to Waiheke Island was cut short because I arrived too late, not realizing that \"island time\" meant shops and wineries closed around 5 p.m.— even earlier than I'm used to back home on Maui.\n\nI decided to linger in the town of Rotorua since it had so many unique activities nearby: a Maori cultural experience, New Zealand's original geothermal spa, a redwood tree walk, and the Hobbiton movie set tour.\n\nWhen I stepped off the bus, I expected to see a bustling tourist spot. Instead, I thought Rotorua felt like a ghost town — one with a pungent sulphur smell that only worsened at night.\n\nWhen I got to my next destination, Taupo, I immediately wished I'd booked more time there. It had the same lakeside charm but with more life, fresher-smelling air, and more affordable food — including tons of options for my keto diet.\n\nNew Zealand is renowned for its stunning scenery, but some bus routes have better views on a particular side.\n\nBefore each ride, I wish I'd looked into which side offered the best vantage points instead of realizing halfway through that I was on the wrong one.\n\nI was eager to experience the TranzAlpine journey through New Zealand's Southern Alps — it's celebrated as one of the most scenic train rides in the world.\n\nThe views were wonderful, but I'm not sure doing a round trip on the train was the best, most interesting use of my time.\n\nLater, I realized it would have made more sense to get off in Greymouth and continue by bus down the West Coast to Queenstown.\n\nThat alternative route would have taken more time and required an overnight stay, but it would have given me a richer, more novel experience than simply looping back to Christchurch.\n\nI planned stays in Lake Tekapo and Te Anau hoping to glimpse the aurora australis, or southern lights, but canceled both due to cloudy forecasts that would have made aurora chasing impossible.\n\nAfter rerouting, I also canceled a hot pool and stargazing experience I'd confidently booked as non-refundable, which meant losing that money.\n\nTo fill this gap in my itinerary, I stayed longer in Queenstown, where I never expected to see the aurora because of light pollution. Ironically, that's exactly where I captured photos of the cosmic phenomenon.\n\nAll that said, next time I travel, I probably wouldn't book non-refundable excursions that are so contingent on weather.\n\nWhether it was because of weather, logistical mishaps, or my health, I ended up rescheduling and canceling a lot of excursions throughout my journey.\n\nThis included stays in several cities, a trip on the Coastal Pacific train route, a whale-watching flight, and more.\n\nIf I'd had more days in New Zealand, maybe things would've been different. However, I could've benefitted from narrowing down my plans off the bat to focus on what I truly wanted while creating more time for spontaneity.\n\nThat said, I'm grateful I gave myself the flexibility to back out of plans that no longer aligned without guilt or regret.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI is building a team to make sure bad ads don't mess up its highly anticipated introduction of advertising in ChatGPT.\n\nAn OpenAI job listing for a software engineer posted late January revealed the company is building an \"ads integrity\" team.\n\nThe ad describes the job as a high-impact role on \"a 0 → 1 team,\" a commonly used term in Silicon Valley and elsewhere to describe a team being built from scratch.\n\nThis person will be responsible for designing systems that enable OpenAI's ad business to grow without compromising user trust and safety, per the listing.\n\nIt's common for Big Tech companies with large ad businesses to create teams to combat ad fraud and address other issues, such as brand safety. OpenAI, which confirmed last month that it would soon begin testing ChatGPT ads, is building this part of its ad function early.\n\nThe job listing also says that its new ad integrity hire will work on developing \"know your customer\" (KYC) systems to verify advertisers' identities and assess their risk. KYC, a term most commonly used in the finance industry, is an important but labor-intensive discipline for cracking down on scam ads and other harmful content created by criminals and other bad actors. It's a particularly pressing issue for Big Tech companies with self-service ad platforms, as a recent Reuters investigation into Meta highlighted. Meta said in early December it had removed \"more than 134 million scam ads\" in 2025.\n\nAriella Garcia, chief operating officer of the Check My Ads Institute, said it would be interesting to see how substantive OpenAI's investment in its ads integrity team would be beyond the initial launch.\n\n\"KYC on advertisers is certainly a good foundation, but the materiality of the risk of a large volume of scam ads in the early days is far lower,\" Garcia said.\n\nThe job listing says that the new ads integrity hire will play a role in determining where and how ads are shown in ChatGPT. OpenAI will need to keep user trust in its organic answers as it ramps up its advertising business. At the same time, advertisers have said that OpenAI will need to prove that ads within AI answers can drive results for their businesses if it has any hope of scaling.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the company will run a small test of ads on ChatGPT's free version and its Go tier in the US, which users should begin seeing in the coming weeks.\n\nThe spokesperson said OpenAI is asking for a minimum spend of $200,000 on ChatGPT ads to participate in the program, confirming prior Adweek reporting. OpenAI will track clicks and impressions, but will likely explore further measurement options as its advertising experiments progress, the spokesperson said.\n\nOpenAI declined to comment on the ads integrity job ad.",

In December, he told a podcast host that he stayed on the island for one night on a trip connected to fundraising activities.\n\n\"Note to self: Google before going,\" Hoffman said on the podcast.\n\nHoffman's appearance in the Epstein files has helped reignite the billionaire's feud with Elon Musk.",

    "description": "Billionaire investor Ray Dalio said he believes gold is still a safe-haven asset, given its large presence in central bank reserves.",
    "fullText": "For Ray Dalio, gold hasn't lost its shine.\n\nWhile many metal investors are likely still shaken by gold's 12% plunge last Friday, the famed hedge fund founder said he wasn't fazed by gold's big drop. That's because bullion is still a safe-haven asset, Dalio said, making the case for why gold should still be a part of investors' portfolios at the World Governments Summit on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking at the conference in Dubai, the Bridgewater founder noted that gold was still held in large amounts by the world's central banks. Bullion surpassed the euro as the second-largest reserve asset last year.\n\n\"I think if people were to make — those who are running policies and so on — were to say, they would say gold is the safest money in this kind of environment,\" Dalio said.\n\nThe safety of the metal also doesn't \"change by the day,\" Dalio added, referring to the gold's long-standing status as a hedge against inflation and an alternative to fiat money.\n\nWhile gold is still down 7% from its all-time high, its price is up 71% in the last year.\n\n\"I think people make the mistake of thinking, 'Is it going to go up or down, and should I buy it?'\" Dalio said, suggesting that a better question would be how much an investor should allocate to gold as a percentage of their total portfolio.\n\nGold sold off hard alongside other metals last week as investors took in President Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh for Fed Chair. Investors quickly repriced their outlook for rates and the dollar, prompting a rapid unwind of their metal positions.\n\nPart of gold's allure in the past year has also been fueled by perceived economic risks, such as the fear that debt levels could rise to unsustainable levels or that the US dollar could weaken alongside other fiat currencies.\n\nDalio, who has regularly warned markets of such risks, said he still believes the US is \"on the brink\" of a capital war, a situation where geopolitical tensions make global investors hesitant to lend money to the US by buying its bonds.\n\n\"Gold is a diversifier. In other words, when the bad times come along, it does uniquely well,\" Dalio said. \"I'd say the most important thing is to have a well-diversified portfolio.\"\n\nDalio is known for being a proponent of gold investing. In the past, he's recommended that investors allocate 15% of their portfolios to gold and bitcoin, pointing to concerns about currency debasement.",

    "description": "Business Insider was on the scene at a WSJ conference that brought together leaders from Blackstone, Lazard, and Citi.",
    "fullText": "Most people flock to Palm Beach for sunshine and an escape. But on Tuesday, Wall Street's elite got 40-degree weather and nonstop talk about one company: Anthropic.\n\nAs the morning session of The Wall Street Journal's Invest Live event kicked off, the AI startup announced its new \"Claude Cowork\" legal plugins, a tool designed to automate contract triage and NDAs. The news unnerved investors, dragging down indexes like the Nasdaq and tech stocks from Palantir to Oracle. Thomson Reuters had dipped 20% by mid-afternoon, experiencing one of its worst single-day drops as investors panicked that software investments deemed cutting-edge a few years ago could soon be rendered passé.\n\nPeter Orszag, CEO of the investment bank Lazard and a former Obama administration official, offered a sobering macro view. \"The US economy and the equity market at this point are highly levered bets with regard to AI taking off,\" he said. \"What I think you're seeing is when people get nervous about whether that'll happen.\"\n\nThat said, he didn't contest the tech's future — just that some key players might not be around in a few years. \"You can bet on the technology paying off,\" he said, \"but that the firms making the investments today are not necessarily the ones that benefit.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Jon Gray, president of Blackstone, which manages over $1.3 trillion, emphasized the lucrative effects of the mini-economy that's sprung up to meet the physical and infrastructural demands of the artificial intelligence boom.\n\n\"To us, you don't necessarily have to know who the winners and losers are going to be,\" Gray said. \"You know that the data centers, the autonomous vehicles, the robots, they're all going to plug into the wall, and there's going to be a lot of need for digital infrastructure.\"\n\nSeveral attendees had recently returned from last month's World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps and were likely hoping to leave the chill behind. But alas, one woman I spotted was bundled up in fur, and I personally had to fish out a 10-year-old coat from the back of my closet to make it from my Uber to the event's entrance.\n\nAt lunchtime, we decamped to the courtyard for a salmon salad and sweet iced tea, and the conversation drifted between the rise of South Florida in the post-pandemic era and the outlook for financial sponsors' spending this year. But as we shuffled back to our seats for the afternoon's lineup of speakers, the chill returned as we caught up with the market's increasingly dour reaction to Anthropic's news.\n\nSteven Tananbaum, founder of GoldenTree Asset Management, saw an opportunity in the rout. For a credit specialist, \"indiscriminate selling\" is a chance to find value where others see only collapse. \"The idea that all software is the same is what's exciting,\" he said about the broad sell-off. \"There's just indiscriminate selling regardless of what the prospects are.\"\n\nThe day ended with a reminder that while the markets might be sweating over incremental news, the C-suite is playing a longer game.\n\nAs it happened, I got to ask the final question of the day's concluding speaker, Mark Mason, Citi's chief financial officer, who's stepping down from his role this spring. He pointed to the cost-saving potential of AI, which would free up more money for Citi to devote to advancing CEO Jane Fraser's mission: putting the bank's multiyear overhaul behind it. The bank is applying the tech to its most critical processes, he said.\n\n\"What will it take to actually drive greater efficiency in that process? And I think that's a much better approach than the way others have thought about use cases,\" he added, referring to other banks.\n\nEarlier in the day, Hemant Taneja, the CEO of General Catalyst, a major VC backer of Anthropic, conceded that the economy will shed jobs due to AI, urging attendees to focus on education to retrain workers. \"Never ever was there a case that every skill in any job can be better done by AI and robotics,\" he said, \"which is, I think, where we are headed in the next, not five, but 20 to 30 years.\"\n\nStill, some speakers, like billionaire activist Nelson Peltz, brought some levity to the proceedings. Peltz — famous for his high-profile corporate showdowns with executives like Disney's Bob Iger — expressed enthusiasm for technology that could pump out faster, simpler answers to his legal questions.\n\n\"Not being a lawyer, I'm sort of happy,\" he said, as anxious laughter coursed through the room.",

    "description": "Over 1,000 people have donated to a GoFundMe for laid-off Washington Post staffers, including several notable names.",
    "fullText": "Money is pouring in for workers impacted by Wednesday's layoffs at The Washington Post.\n\nAs of writing, over 1,000 supporters had donated more than $130,000 combined to a GoFundMe page set up for let-go journalists.\n\nThe fundraising push, launched just a few hours after company executives began cutting workers, was set up by Post reporter Rachel Siegel and the newsroom's union. Its top donor, tech journalist and former Post employee Kara Swisher, gave $10,000.\n\nSwisher, who recently made a push to buy the Post from its billionaire owner, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, wrote on Threads that she had the means to \"donate a decent chunk of dough to these hardworking employees,\" and urged others to follow.\n\nOther top donors appeared to be former Washington Post staffers, such as Eugene Robinson and Fred Barbash.\n\nThe Post's haul, and the speed at which it drew in six figures, make it an outlier among media layoff fundraisers. Laid-off staffers at Vox Media pulled in about $7,000 in their January GoFundMe, while Teen Vogue got about $41,000 after November layoffs.\n\n\"Post Guild members have come together to support their colleagues with this GoFundMe,\" said a spokesperson for the Washington Baltimore News Guild, which represents the paper's union. The spokesperson blamed \"inexcusable business decisions of top Post leadership\" for the cuts.\n\n\"The Washington Post is taking a number of difficult but decisive actions today for our future, in what amounts to a significant restructuring across the company,\" a Post spokesperson said in a statement on the layoffs. \"These steps are designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.\"\n\nAs donations flooded in, others in the media industry offered career support. Executives at the platforms Substack and Beehiiv posted on X (formerly Twitter) that they're offering fee waivers and training for any Post reporters who took the leap to go independent, for example.\n\nThe Post's layoffs, which its newsroom union said impacted hundreds of workers, were designed to trim costs and refocus its efforts around a smaller set of coverage areas, executive editor Matt Murray told employees over Zoom on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe company is shutting down its podcast, \"Post Reports,\" and letting go of journalists focused on sports, books, and foreign affairs. It's restructuring its D.C. metro coverage, and investing in areas like politics and national security that \"demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact,\" Murray wrote in a memo to staff, viewed by Business Insider.\n\n\"Today is about positioning ourselves to become more essential to people's lives in what has become a more crowded, competitive, and complicated media landscape,\" Murray told staffers during the call. \"For too long, we've operated with a structure that's too rooted in the days when we were a quasi-monopoly local newspaper.\"",

    "description": "Tech stocks are trading lower as investors assess whether AI could upend current software leadership. Analysts say the market reaction is overblown.",
    "fullText": "Bank of America analysts say Wall Street is blowing the latest AI fears out of proportion as the tech sell-off drags on.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is down about 2% on Wednesday, extending losses from Tuesday's session. Analysts say recent losses, fueled by AI disruption worries and some poorly received earnings, are overblown and don't justify the broad sell-off.\n\nThe sell-off kicked off in the software sector after AI start-up Anthropic introduced a new plugin for its Claude Cowork AI agent. The new tool is said to be more automatic in completing clerical tasks than conversational chatbots, fueling worries that AI will replace software and dethrone existing market leaders.\n\nWilliam Blair analysts say these fears are overstated, calling the new AI tool the latest \"boogeyman in software.\"\n\nThe analysts say that while there will be some AI disruption in store for software makers, it will be how companies adapt to the AI era that sets apart the winners and losers.\n\n\"There will naturally be some disruption, especially for point solutions, nice to have tools (as opposed to mission-critical systems), and vendors that are not able or willing to adapt to the new tech paradigm,\" they wrote, noting, \"This does not justify the broad-based indiscriminate selling we are seeing across the sector.\"\n\nBank of America compared the recent tech sector nosedive to the January 2025 sell-off fueled by Chinese AI DeepSeek, which spurred major short-term losses for Wall Street and erased $1 trillion in market capitalization in one day.\n\n\"In several respects, the current indiscriminate selloff resembles the DeepSeek-driven decline of Jan'25, which ultimately proved unfounded and was followed by higher capex and accelerating AI token growth.\"\n\nDespite investors' panic that DeepSeek marked a turning point in the AI arms race, major indexes not only recovered but ended 2025 up by double digits, fueled in large part by AI momentum. The analysts also noted that global cloud capital spending grew 69% in 2025 from the year-ago period, above previous forecasts in spite of worries.\n\nSoftware's dramatic downturn reflects negative investor sentiment around the sector, not a change in fundamentals.\n\nIn fact, Bank of America underlined the incongruence of Wall Street's thinking, which is driving \"inconsistency in AI stock moves.\"\n\n\"Price action implies AI capex is deteriorating to the point of weak ROI and unsustainable growth, while simultaneously suggesting AI adoption will be so pervasive and productivity-enhancing that long-standing software workflows and business models become obsolete. Both outcomes cannot occur at once.\"\n\nWilliam Blair analysts echoed a view calling software weakness a \"sentiment problem.\" They highlighted the post-earnings price declines in Microsoft and ServiceNow stocks, despite the companies' fundamentally strong prints. AMD saw a similar drop after its stock fell over 17% on Wednesday, despite earnings beating on the top and bottom lines.",

    "fullText": "Nike is facing a federal probe over allegations that its DEI targets led to discrimination against white workers.\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Wednesday that it has asked a federal judge to require Nike to provide information for its investigation into alleged racial discrimination. The sportswear giant is accused of intentional systemic discrimination against white employees, with some requests for information dating back to 2018.\n\nA Nike spokesperson called the filing a \"surprising and unusual escalation.\"\n\n\"We have shared thousands of pages of information and detailed written responses to the EEOC's inquiry and are in the process of providing additional information,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThey added: \"We are committed to fair and lawful employment practices and follow all applicable laws, including those that prohibit discrimination.\"\n\nThe subpoena enforcement action stems from an investigation charge filed by EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas in May 2024. Lucas alleged that Nike violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 through unlawful employment practices, including layoff selection, training and development opportunities, hiring, and promotion, all of which were based, in whole or in part, on race.\n\nThe EEOC wants Nike to turn over its criteria for choosing employees for layoffs, and how it tracks and uses worker race and ethnicity data, including as a factor for setting executive pay, the agency said. It also wants more information about 16 programs accused of providing mentoring, leadership, or career development opportunities based on race.\n\nIn 2021, Nike announced a five-year road map for creating more diversity and inclusion in its workforce, which included tying executive pay to the company's progress in its DEI efforts. One of the objectives was to target 35% representation of racial and ethnic minorities in its US workforce by 2025. Nike employed 76,600 people as of May 2025.\n\nThe probe marks the latest move by President Donald Trump and his appointees to end DEI programs in the workforce. Last year, Trump signed an executive order to restrict DEI in the federal government and instructed agencies to probe companies over their DEI objectives.\n\n\"Thanks to President Trump's commitment to enforcing our nation's civil rights laws, the EEOC has renewed its focus on evenhanded enforcement of Title VII,\" Lucas said in Wednesday's press release.",

    "fullText": "An award-winning coder has been quietly working for Thinking Machines Lab, the AI startup founded by former OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati.\n\nNeal Wu is a three-time gold medal winner at an international programming Olympiad and a founding member of the AI coding startup Cognition, which is valued at $10 billion. He is the elder brother of Scott Wu, the CEO and cofounder of Cognition.\n\nThe move shows that Thinking Machines Lab, valued at over $10 billion, continues to attract star talent, even as it has been the target of aggressive AI poaching campaigns from rivals like Meta.\n\nThinking Machines Lab declined to comment. Wu and Cognition did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nBusiness Insider reviewed internal correspondence describing Wu as a team member of Thinking Machines Lab, which helps developers train and customize AI models. Neither Wu nor the secretive startup, which is based in San Francisco, has publicly announced his role.\n\nIt's not clear what Wu's exact position is. His LinkedIn profile says he has been working as a cofounder and advisor on \"something new\" since January 2025, around the time Murati's startup emerged from stealth.\n\nThinking Machines Lab has seen top staff leave in the last few months.\n\nMeta's aggressive poaching effort last year saw the tech giant dangling huge offers worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Meta eventually hired cofounder Andrew Tulloch after offering him a compensation package of up to $1.5 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIn January, its CTO, Barret Zoph, along with two other founding members, abruptly jumped ship back to OpenAI.\n\nThinking Machines Lab has a strong staff pedigree, with employees coming from AI labs like OpenAI and Meta. It was valued at more than $10 billion and raised a $2 billion seed round before launching a product.\n\nThe startup was seeking funds at a $50 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported in November.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Hundreds of journalists at The Washington Post received dreaded emails in their inboxes on Wednesday morning informing them they'd been laid off. The emails also addressed another key question: how much severance the Post was offering.\n\nThe newspaper, owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, made sweeping cuts across the newsroom as part of a restructuring of its business. Journalists who cover sports, foreign affairs, books, or do audio reporting were particularly impacted. The company said in a statement that the changes were designed to \"strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart.\"\n\nAs some workers were shown the door, human resources sent over severance packages tied to how long they'd worked at the company. Business Insider viewed a copy of the offer terms.\n\nPost journalists aren't required to take the severance offer, and they could lose the package if they don't act professionally during the process, according to a memo sent to staff by human resources and viewed by Business Insider.\n\nThe company also must negotiate separation terms with the newsroom's union, the Washington Post Guild. That means \"the exact terms of the separation program\" are not yet final, the memo said.\n\nThe Washington Post did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The newspaper's union also did not immediately respond.\n\nIn the memo, the Post's HR point person told affected staff that the decision to cut their jobs was in \"no way a reflection of your worth or dedication, but a necessary step in the evolution of our business.\"\n\nOutside of severance, Post workers may also receive financial support from a new GoFundMe page launched on Wednesday that has raised over $100,000, including $10,000 from Kara Swisher.",

    "description": "The first phase of the Pentagon's drone competition, Gauntlet, begins later this month. US drone operators will fly and test the systems.",
    "fullText": "Over two dozen companies, including two from Ukraine, have been selected to build and test their small one-way attack drone prototypes for the first phase of a new Pentagon program focused on drone dominance.\n\nThe evaluation, Gauntlet, begins later this month at Fort Benning in Georgia, where military personnel will fly the designs, putting them to the test to inform purchasing decisions. When the testing concludes in March, the department will put in roughly $150 million in prototype delivery orders.\n\nThe Pentagon aims to ultimately, by 2027, field hundreds of thousands of low-cost, one-way attack drones.\n\nThe Pentagon released the list of 25 companies involved on Tuesday. It includes a lot of start-ups like Performance Drone Works LLC, which was an offshoot of the Drone Racing League, as well as vendors like Kratos SRE Inc., a subsidiary of the larger Kratos Defense.\n\nTwo Ukrainian companies are also competing in the Gauntlet evaluations: Ukrainian Defense Drone Tech Corp and General Cherry Corp. Both are major developers with years of experience building and upgrading first-person view one-way attack drones for the Ukrainian military.\n\nGeneral Cherry Corp was established in Zaporizhzhia early on in Russia's war against Ukraine and has been developing small uncrewed aerial systems for its forces. Per the company, its first-person-view one-way attack drones are employed across 40 different brigades, and they regularly use soldier feedback to improve their systems.\n\nLate last year, the company revealed its new AIR Pro interceptor drone designed to strike Russian reconnaissance and attack drones. The company said that the AIR Pro had been used on the front lines and demonstrated a speed of around 125 miles per hour.\n\nOn Facebook, General Cherry said its \"participation in the American defense program is a recognition of our combat experience and shows a high level of trust in Ukrainian engineering solutions.\"\n\nThere's little to no information publicly available on the company the Pentagon identified as Ukrainian Defense Drone Tech Corp. Local Ukrainian media identified it as a Ukrainian manufacturer; however, reports said the name was unfamiliar.\n\nAll of the vendors will have their systems tested and evaluated by military drone operators at Fort Benning, Georgia, starting February 18 and leading into early March. Then, DoD will pick drones for prototyping, place delivery orders worth approximately $150 million, and receive the drones over the following five months.\n\nThe Defense Department publicly unveiled its Drone Dominance Program in early December, signaling a push to rapidly acquire large numbers of low-cost attack drones.\n\nThese systems — which have reshaped combat in Ukraine and are becoming an increasingly important part of US testing and operations — were singled out by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as critical because they provide a far cheaper alternative to high-end, expensive munitions.\n\nInitial planning indicates the department intends to spend $1.1 billion on the program over four phases and regularly buy drones to offer a consistent demand signal to the US defense industry.\n\nThe beginning of the program follows announcements from President Donald Trump in June on supporting the American drone industry and arming troops and a memo from Hegseth in July.\n\n\"Drones are the biggest battlefield innovation in a generation, accounting for most of this year's casualties in Ukraine,\" Hegseth said in the July 2025 memo, adding that \"US units are not outfitted with the lethal small drones the modern battlefield requires.\"\n\n\"We are buying what works,\" he said, \"fast, at scale, and without bureaucratic delay.\"\n\nThe full list of defense companies participating in the DoD's Gauntlet competition are: Anno.ai Inc., Ascent Aerosystems Inc., Auterion Government Solutions Inc., Dzyne Technologies LLC, Ewing Aerospace LLC, Farage Precision LLC, Firestorm Labs Inc., General Cherry Corp., Greensight Inc., Griffon Aerospace Inc., Halo Aeronautics LLC, Kratos SRE Inc., ModalAI Inc., Napatree Technology LLC, Neros Inc., Nokturnal AI, Paladin Defense Services LLC, Performance Drone Works LLC, Responsibly Ltd., Swarm Defense Technologies LLC, Teal Drones Inc., Ukrainian Defense Drones Tech Corp., Vector Defense Inc., W.S.

Discovery, though WBD chose Netflix as its preferred acquirer — a decision Paramount is challenging with shareholders and in the courtroom.\n\nUnder Ellison, Paramount has also called most employees back to the office five days a week, made changes to its data and insights team, and looked to jazz up Paramount+ by exploring the addition of short-form video and interactive features.\n\nPersonnel shake-ups are common at companies with new leadership. Another change saw Paramount's head of streaming product and tech, Vibol Hou, leave the company at the end of January, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nHave a tip or Paramount-related story idea?

    "fullText": "Alphabet beat on the top and bottom lines in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, and said it expects to significantly increase spending on artificial intelligence in 2026.\n\nThe stock fell as much as 3% in extended trading.\n\nHere's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:\n\nWall Street was also watching several other numbers in the report:\n\nAlphabet said it expects 2026 capital expenditures to be in the range of $175 billion to $185 billion. The top end of that forecast would be more than double its 2025 spend. The company said in October that it expected \"a significant increase\" to capex in 2026.\n\nThe company's capex spend will go toward investing in AI compute capacity for Google DeepMind and to meet \"significant cloud customer demand as well as strategic investments in other bets,\" Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi told analysts on a call Wednesday. She added that it would be used to \"improve the user experience and drive higher advertiser ROI in Google services.\"\n\nThe company saw revenue increase almost 18% year over year. Net income came in at $34.46 billion, up almost 30% compared to the year prior.\n\nAdvertising revenue came in at $82.28 billion, up 13.5% from a year ago. Revenue for YouTube ads increased almost 9% to $11.38 billion, but it fell short of analysts' expectations of $11.84 billion.\n\nAshkenazi said \"advertising results were negatively affected from the lapping of the strong spend on U.S. election in the fourth quarter of 2024.\"\n\nGoogle Cloud beat Wall Street's expectations, recording a nearly 48% increase in revenue from a year ago. Google's Cloud unit houses most of the company's AI services and products.\n\nThat business's backlog increased 55% sequentially and more than doubled year over year, reaching $240 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, said Ashkenazi.\n\nAlphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on the call Wednesday that its Gemini AI app now has more than 750 million monthly active users, up from 650 million monthly active users last quarter.\n\n\"As we scale, we are getting dramatically more efficient,\" Pichai said. \"We were able to lower Gemini serving unit costs by 78% over 2025 through model optimizations, efficiency and utilization improvements.\"\n\nOther Bets, which includes the company's life sciences unit Verily and self-driving car unit Waymo, reported revenue of $370 million during the quarter, down 7.5% from a year ago. Alphabet reported Other Bets' loss of $3.61 billion, a year-over-year increase of more than 200%.\n\nWaymo took a $2.1 billion stock-based compensation charge for the quarter, as it raised a new funding round at a $16 billion valuation. The majority of the charge was reflected in expenses for research and development, Ashkenazi said.\n\nThe self-driving wing of Alphabet ended 2025 having served 15 million trips in five major U.S. markets, including Austin, Texas; Atlanta; Los Angeles; Phoenix; and the San Francisco Bay Area. In January, Waymo began operating its service in Miami.\n\nWATCH: Google DeepMind CEO on state of the AI race, push towards AGI and AI impact on jobs",

    "description": "Amazon stock has been a laggard among its Magnificent Seven peers, but Wall Street is bullish that the latest results will show AI-driven strength.",
    "fullText": "Amazon will be the latest Magnificent Seven company to report earnings this week, with the e-commerce giant's results due on Thursday after the closing bell.\n\nAs analysts noted in their pre-earnings takes, Amazon has lagged behind most of its mega-cap tech peers for much of the past year. Yet, despite the lackluster performance, many investment banks are optimistic that the company will reveal fresh growth from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and provide key AI updates.\n\nWall Street expects Amazon tp post earnings-per-share of $1.96 for the quarter and revenue of $211.2 billion to $211.56 billion. Analysts anticipate that Amazon's earnings before interest and taxes will be $24.6 billion.\n\nHere's what analysts say they will be listening for on Amazon's earnings call.\n\nBofA analyst Justin Post expects Amazon to come in slightly above Wall Street estimates on key metrics, predicting revenue of $213 billion and EBIT of $26 billion. He also thinks that AWS growth will accelerate in 2026, helping Amazon regain some momentum.\n\n\"We expect 22% y/y AWS growth (above Street at 21% and an accel from 20% in 3Q) as greater capacity drives incremental sales, and we think investors could also be around 22% y/y,\" he said.\n\nWhile JPMorgan analysts remain bullish on Amazon heading into earnings, they do note some concerns regarding Amazon's position and strategy when it comes to AI. They find the recent AWS price increases encouraging, though, as they indicate strong demand.\n\n\"We remain bullish on AWS growth acceleration driven by core cloud growth & ramping AI contribution led by Project Rainier, Trn ramp, & new partnerships,\" they wrote.\n\nThe analysts added, though, that despite some concern, AWS' growth and the company's cost discipline should support strong free cash flow growth in the coming year, even as Amazon ramps up AI capex.\n\nDeutsche Bank analysts aren't expecting Amazon's Q4 earnings report to quickly juice the stock's performance, but they do anticipate a positive quarter overall, particularly in e-commerce demand and AWS-driven revenue growth.\n\n\"While we don't expect 4Q earnings to be the magic bullet that changes these fortunes, we do expect another positive earnings outcome to continue to chip away at this underperformance and believe Amazon can be one of the largest outperformers in our coverage in 2026,\" stated analyst Lee Horowitz.\n\nUBS analyst Stephen Ju and his team increased their estimates for both AWS growth and Amazon's capex, citing the company's plans to double capacity by 2027.\n\n\"As 4Q25 results marks the second quarter of AWS acceleration, we expect investor conviction to continue to rise and drive outperformance as capital continues to rotate into AMZN shares,\" Ju stated in a note to investors.\n\nHe added that his team expects Amazon to benefit from its investments in areas such as gross merchandise volume, advertising, and data, which are expected to help increase its free cash flow.\n\nAmazon remains a top pick for Mizuho, who sees it as a winner of the online advertising boom. Analyst Lloyd Walmsley also thinks it stands to benefit from ongoing demand both for its AI services and its e-commerce business.\n\n\"As GenAI compute demand increasingly shifts to inference this plays to Amazon's strength and should help further boost revenues at AWS,\" he noted. \"On retail, we see ongoing cost-to-serve improvements from more automation in fulfillment centers and continued improvement in logistics architecture, aided by rapid growth in advertising driving improving retail margins.\"\n\nCorrection: February 4, 2026 — An earlier version of this story misstated the date of Amazon earnings as Wednesday. The report is on Thursday.",

    "description": "The problem with billionaires like Jeff Bezos owning news properties like The Washington Post is they can decide one day to turn off the spigot.",
    "fullText": "The cuts at The Washington Post are brutal.\n\nThey are brutal for the paper's readers, who lose crucial coverage like sports and international reporting. And they are brutal for hundreds of Post employees, including lots of people whose work I pay to read with my Post subscription.\n\nThe Post's cuts have also led lots of people to point out the obvious — that Post owner Jeff Bezos, who is currently the world's fourth-richest man, worth an estimated $261 billion, could easily fund the paper's losses … forever, without ever noticing the tab.\n\nJeff Bezos wealth in 2024: $194 billion\n\nJeff Bezos wealth in 2025: $215 billion\n\nJeff Bezos wealth today: $249.4 billion\n\nNet increase in Bezos wealth since 2024: $55.4 billion\n\nCost of Bezos’s 417-foot superyacht: $500 million\n\nAmazon investment in \"Melania\": $75 million…\n\nThe Washington Post lost $77 million in 2023.\n\nJeff Bezos just spent at least $75 million on an infomercial named “Melania” — $40 million paid to the President and First Lady. \n\nPriorities. https://t.co/dsC29R0pVi\n\nJeff Bezos just fired hundreds of reporters at the Washington Post — including the Amazon reporter holding his OWN company accountable.\n\nReminder: Jeff Bezos' net worth is nearly $250,000,000,000.\n\nFor the record: I also wish that Bezos would take his loose change and spend it on journalism.\n\nNote that I didn't say \"journalism instead of\" because when you are talking about Bezos-level wealth, you don't have to choose: You can pay for journalism and rockets and superyachts and Venetian weddings and parties in St. Barts. (And yes, I realize that Bezos' Amazon expenditures on things like the \"Melania\" doc are different from Bezos' personal spending. The point is, he can afford it. In the same way that I can afford to buy a fancy coffee now and then.)\n\nI'm also not weighing in on how much of the Post's problems are the same problems facing every news organization, versus ones Bezos exacerbated by pivoting toward Trump. Or whether the new Post plan — focus on a handful of topics it thinks will resonate with a national audience, like politics and wellness — makes sense or is simply a too-late move already made by many Post competitors.\n\nBut the focus on Bezos underscores the problem the Post has been facing for years: It was a money-losing operation that relied on a billionaire's goodwill. First, to buy it from its previous owners, who let it go for the price of a Joe Rogan podcast deal, and then to fund its losses for years.\n\nMaybe Bezos really is sick of paying for the Post's losses. Maybe funding the Post no longer syncs with a turns out, Donald Trump is actually good now, worldview. The point is that the Post has been in the can't-win position of hoping Jeff Bezos would continue to fund those losses for years. Now he doesn't want to. (Bezos has yet to comment publicly on the cuts; Matt Murray, the Post's top editor, told his staff that the cuts are meant to help \"reinvent The Washington Post for this new era. This work is difficult, but is essential.\")\n\nWhich, again, points out how precarious a position just about every news organization in the US is in right now.\n\nThere are a handful of really excellent publications, which are controlled by billionaires or very wealthy families — The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Bloomberg News — that are aimed at an upscale, national audience, and they are doing well. There are some thriving startups and niche publications that tend to focus on topics that rich people — or their employers — will pay to learn more about. (Several of them, it turns out, are focused on power and Washington, DC — a sector the Post should have owned.) And there are various forms of aggregators that make a living by repackaging news other people generate, like newsletter publisher 1440.\n\nAnd that's … kind of it. The local news market is so bad we routinely use the word \"desert\" to describe it. There have been many attempts to solve that, and people keep trying new ways to tackle the problem. I wish all of them well because we really, really need local news. TV news is contracting because TV is contracting. Magazines are now frequently \"brands attached to hotels or travel agencies.\"\n\nFaced with this grim reality, it's natural to look at Bezos and think: Just pay for it. And again — I wish he would. But relying on billionaire goodwill is a hope, not a plan.\n\nJournalism — no matter how much we right-size, automate, and innovate — is expensive. And up until the internet, journalism usually existed in the US in spite of those costs because it was bundled with other things people (subscribers, advertisers) were willing to pay for.\n\nNow that bundle has been torn apart, so we need both new models that support what we have today — and ownership structures that will be satisfied with self-sustaining businesses, not ones with huge profit expectations. If I knew how to do that, I'd be doing it. I just know that hoping a billionaire will fix it isn't the answer.",

    "title": "5 of the biggest takeaways from Google's Q4 2025 earnings call",
    "description": "Alphabet's Q4 results beat estimates. Google plans to double capex in 2026, while search and cloud remained strong.",
    "fullText": "Google just reported another blockbuster quarter, with its fourth-quarter revenue soaring past Wall Street expectations,\n\nThat said, you might not think it to look at the stock, which took a dip after Google announced it planned to double its capital expenditure in 2026, predicting it will spend between $175 billion and $185 billion — far beyond analysts' prior expectations.\n\nSome upbeat numbers softened the blow, with Google's search advertising and cloud business running hot. Google announced its annual revenue had exceeded $400 billion for the first time, while quarterly revenue hit $113.8 billion, above estimates of $111 billion. Google Cloud became a particularly bright spot, with revenues up 48% year over year.\n\nHere are the biggest takeaways from Alphabet's earnings call.\n\nLet's get the big one out of the way. Google said on Wednesday that it expects capital expenditures of between $175 billion and $185 billion in 2026. That's the money going to data centers, chips, construction materials, and other components needed to build out and support Google's AI efforts.\n\nIt's a huge figure. Google previously warned that its capex spend would be higher than last year's, when it spent just over $90 billion. Its updated guidance for 2026 surpassed street expectations and sent the stock tumbling 2% after its otherwise very healthy earnings report.\n\nGoogle's capex estimate is even higher than Meta's, which last week said it expects to spend between $115 billion and $135 billion for 2026, nearly doubling its spend from last year.\n\nGoogle said its Gemini app now has over 750 million monthly active users. That's 100 million more than it had in October last year.\n\n\"We are also seeing significantly higher engagement per user, especially since the launch of Gemini 3 in December,\" said Google CEO Sundar Pichai on the call on Wednesday.\n\nWhile the graph trends in the right direction, it also suggests a slowdown, as Google said in October that it had gained 200 million extra users over Q3, aided by the rollout of its viral Nano Banana image generator.\n\nGoogle said on Wednesday that it now has over 325 million paid subscriptions across its consumer services, with Google One and YouTube Premium the most popular.\n\nTo put that number in perspective, Netflix announced last month it had also hit 325 million subscribers. It's not a total like-for-like comparison — Netflix doesn't have a cloud storage product, for one. Still, with YouTube clearly taking a big chunk of those users, it should be enough to alarm Netflix's leaders.\n\nGoogle likes to talk up its full-stack AI advantage. By owning everything from AI models to cloud servers and chips, Google gains more control over the technology and how it all fits together.\n\nOn Wednesday's call, Pichai flagged that Google was seeing significant benefits from this, lowering Gemini's serving unit costs by 78% over 2025 \"through model optimizations, efficiency, and utilization improvements.\"\n\nSoftware stocks took a hammering this week after Anthropic rolled out new features that could perform clerical and administrative tasks for people in the legal industry.\n\nCould this be another \"DeepSeek moment,\" as Evercore senior managing director Mark Mahaney suggested on the call? Pichai suggested the scramble this week might be overblown.\n\n\"I think it is an enabling tool, just like it has been an enabling tool for us across our products and services, be it Search, YouTube, etc,\" Pichai said of Gemini, saying that companies that are \"seizing the moment\" will \"have the same opportunity ahead.\"\n\nHave something to share?

    "fullText": "An error occurred while preparing your download\n\nChlamydia pneumoniae—a common bacterium that causes pneumonia and sinus infections—can linger in the eye and brain for years and may aggravate Alzheimer’s disease, according to a study from Cedars-Sinai. Published in Nature Communications, the discovery suggests this bacterium can amplify Alzheimer’s disease and points to potential interventions including inflammation-limiting therapies and early antibiotic treatment.\n\nThe study shows for the first time that Chlamydia pneumoniae can reach the retina—the tissue lining the back of the eye—where it triggers immune responses linked to inflammation, nerve cell death and cognitive decline.\n\n“Seeing Chlamydia pneumoniae consistently across human tissues, cell cultures and animal models allowed us to identify a previously unrecognized link between bacterial infection, inflammation and neurodegeneration,” said Maya Koronyo-Hamaoui, PhD, professor of Neurosurgery, Neurology, and Biomedical Sciences at Cedars-Sinai Health Sciences University and the leading, senior author of the study. “The eye is a surrogate for the brain, and this study shows that retinal bacterial infection and chronic inflammation can reflect brain pathology and predict disease status, supporting retinal imaging as a noninvasive way to identify people at risk for Alzheimer’s.”\n\nTo conduct the study, researchers used advanced imaging, genetic testing and protein analysis to examine retinal tissue from 104 individuals, some with normal cognition, some with mild cognitive impairment and some with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nThey found significantly higher levels of Chlamydia pneumoniae in the retinas and brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease than they found in people with normal cognition. The higher the bacterial levels detected, the more severe the brain changes and cognitive decline investigators found.\n\nHigher levels of the bacterium were more common in people who carried the APOE4 gene variant, a known risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nInvestigators also studied human neurons in the lab and in laboratory mice with Alzheimer’s disease. In both, infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae increased inflammation, nerve cell death and cognitive decline, showing the bacterium can accelerate disease processes. The infection also triggered production of amyloid-beta, the protein that accumulates in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.\n\nThe findings were driven by co-first authors Bhakta Gaire, PhD, and Yosef Koronyo, MSc.\n\n“This discovery raises the possibility of targeting the infection-inflammation axis to treat Alzheimer’s,” said Timothy Crother, PhD, co-corresponding author of the study and research professor at Cedars-Sinai Guerin Children's and the Department of Biomedical Sciences at Cedars‑Sinai.\n\nThe findings suggest that targeting chronic bacterial infection—and the inflammation it triggers—could represent a new treatment strategy. The research also supports potential use of the retina as a noninvasive way to help diagnose and monitor the disease.\n\nAdditional Cedars-Sinai authors include Bhakta Gaire, Yosef Koronyo, Jean-Philippe Vit, Alexandre Hutton, Lalita Subedi, Dieu-Trang Fuchs, Natalie Swerdlow, Altan Rentsendorj, Saba Shahin, Daisy Martinon, Edward Robinson, Alexander V.

    "fullText": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation has so far been unable to access data from a Washington Post reporter’s iPhone because it was protected by Apple’s Lockdown Mode when agents seized the device from the reporter’s home, the US government said in a court filing.\n\nFBI agents were able to access the reporter’s work laptop by telling her to place her index finger on the MacBook Pro’s fingerprint reader, however. This occurred during the January 14 search at the Virginia home of reporter Hannah Natanson.\n\nAs previously reported, the FBI executed a search warrant at Natanson’s home as part of an investigation into a Pentagon contractor accused of illegally leaking classified data. FBI agents seized an iPhone 13 owned by the Post, one MacBook Pro owned by the Post and another MacBook Pro owned by Natanson, a 1TB portable hard drive, a voice recorder, and a Garmin watch.\n\nGovernment investigators want to read Natanson’s Signal messages, and were able to view at least some of them on her work laptop. The reporter has said she has a contact list of 1,100 current and former government employees in Signal, which she uses for encrypted chats.\n\nThe Justice Department described the search in a court filing that was submitted Friday in US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and noted in a 404 Media article today. The government filing opposes a motion in which the Post and Natanson asked the court to order the return of the seized devices. A federal magistrate judge previously issued a standstill order telling the government to stop searching the devices until the court rules on whether they must be returned.\n\n“The iPhone was found powered on and charging, and its display noted that the phone was in ‘Lockdown’ mode,” the government filing said. After the seized devices were taken to the FBI’s Washington field office, the Computer Analysis Response Team (CART) “began processing each device to preserve the information therein,” the filing said.\n\nCART couldn’t get anything from the iPhone. “Because the iPhone was in Lockdown mode, CART could not extract that device,” the government filing said.\n\nThe government also submitted a declaration by FBI Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky that said the agency “has paused any further efforts to extract this device because of the Court’s Standstill Order.” The FBI did extract information from the SIM card “with an auto-generated HTML report created by the tool utilized by CART,” but “the data contained in the HTML was limited to the telephone number.”\n\nApple says that LockDown Mode “helps protect devices against extremely rare and highly sophisticated cyber attacks,” and is “designed for the very few individuals who, because of who they are or what they do, might be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats.”\n\nIntroduced in 2022, Lockdown Mode is available for iPhones, iPads, and Macs. It must be enabled separately for each device. To enable it on an iPhone or iPad, a user would open the Settings app, tap Privacy & Security, scroll down and tap Lockdown Mode, and then tap Turn on Lockdown Mode.\n\nThe process is similar on Macs. In the System Settings app that can be accessed via the Apple menu, a user would click Privacy & Security, scroll down and click Lockdown Mode, and then click Turn On.\n\n“When Lockdown Mode is enabled, your device won’t function like it typically does,” Apple says. “To reduce the attack surface that potentially could be exploited by highly targeted mercenary spyware, certain apps, websites, and features are strictly limited for security and some experiences might not be available at all.”\n\nLockdown Mode blocks most types of message attachments, blocks FaceTime calls from people you haven’t contacted in the past 30 days, restricts the kinds of browser technologies that websites can use, limits photo sharing, and imposes other restrictions. Users can exclude specific apps and websites they trust from these restrictions, however.\n\nFBI agents had more success getting into Natanson’s other devices, though the Justice Department complained that “Ms. Natanson misled investigators about the devices that were seized. She misrepresented to officers that the devices could not be unlocked with biometrics, possibly in order to prevent the Government from reviewing materials within the scope of the search warrant.”\n\nThe Rozhavsky declaration said that during the home search, FBI agents “advised Natanson that the FBI could not compel her to provide her passcodes,” but “the warrant did give the FBI authority to use Natanson’s biometrics, such as facial recognition or fingerprints, to open her devices. Natanson stated that she did not use biometrics on her devices.”\n\nNatanson’s personal MacBook Pro was powered off when it was found by FBI agents. The Post-owned MacBook Pro was found in a backpack in the kitchen and was powered on and locked. The FBI said an agent “presented Natanson with her open laptop” and “assisted” her in unlocking the device with her finger. The declaration described what happened as follows:\n\nNatanson was reminded the FBI has authority to use her biometrics to unlock the laptop and Natanson repeated that she does not use biometrics on her devices. Natanson was told she must try, in accordance with the authorization in the warrant. The FBI assisted Natanson with applying her right index finger to the fingerprint reader which immediately unlocked the laptop.\n\nIn 2024, a federal appeals court ruled that the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination does not prohibit police officers from forcing a suspect to unlock a phone with a thumbprint scan. That case involved a traffic stop, rather than a home search authorized by a warrant.\n\nThe FBI has so far been unable “to obtain a full physical image” of Natanson’s work laptop, but did make a “limited partial live logical image,” the government filing said. At least some of Natanson’s Signal chat messages were set for auto-deletion, so FBI agents took photos and made audio recordings of the chats, but the government filing said this was done “only for preservation purposes and no substantive review has occurred.”\n\nThe FBI apparently hasn’t gotten any data from Natanson’s personal computer. “Natanson’s personal MacBook Pro is password protected and encrypted and therefore no imaging was effected. The FBI paused any further efforts because of [the] Court’s Standstill Order. No review has occurred,” Rozhavsky wrote.\n\nThe government said it processed data from the voice recorder and 1TB hard drive but has not reviewed the data yet. The Garmin watch wasn’t processed before the court issued a standstill order; “therefore, no processing will occur until further order of the Court,” the declaration said.\n\nThe investigation’s target is Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator in Maryland who has a top-secret security clearance and was arrested after being accused of taking classified intelligence reports home. The Justice Department said Washington Post articles contained classified information from those reports, and that the government should be allowed to review the Post reporter’s seized devices in preparation for Perez-Lugones’ trial.\n\nThe government said it was able to read at least some of the Signal messages by reviewing Perez-Lugones’ device. “Prior to his arrest, the FBI consensually reviewed messages between Mr. Perez-Lugones and Ms. Natanson sent via Signal on or around January 7 and 8, 2026… The messages discussed the classification level of certain documents, set forth details about which US government agencies had produced different reports, and explained how certain documents would be referenced in forthcoming news articles,” the Justice Department court filing said.\n\nThe Post argues that a wide-ranging government search of Natanson’s various devices violates the First Amendment and that the government’s legitimate interests could be satisfied with a more limited subpoena. The government claims in response that the Washington Post wants the court “to reimagine the First Amendment as a journalist’s exception to search warrants.”\n\n“Under the reasonableness standard of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g), the Government is entitled to maintain this evidence because it is relevant to an ongoing investigation and prosecution,” the Justice Department said. “In addition, the Government cannot be reasonably required to hand over to Movants devices that the Government has probable cause to believe contain its own highly classified information.”\n\nThe government said the Post’s suggestion of a subpoena for specific information from the devices “ignores the obvious risk that evidence could be lost either through a failure to preserve expiring Signal messages or bad faith conduct.” Natanson’s false claim that she did not use biometrics suggests that the Post and Natanson can’t be trusted to preserve documents, the brief said.\n\n“The record confirms the correctness of the Government’s choice to proceed with a search warrant,” the Justice Department said.\n\nThe Post/Natanson motion was supported in a brief filed by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. The FBI “seiz[ed] electronic devices that contain [Natanson’s] most sensitive work product alongside confidential communications with her sources,” the brief said. “Only a fraction of the information the Department seized is even imaginably relevant to its stated basis for that intrusion: the leak investigation of a government contractor who has already been identified, charged, and arrested.” The brief urged the court to stop federal agents from searching through “unrelated newsgathering material and doing irreparable damage to the confidentiality on which effective reporting depends.”",

    "title": "Samsung Has Killed Software Support for Most of the Galaxy S21 Series",
    "description": "Samsung's 2024 \"seven-year promise\" doesn't apply to previous models.",
    "fullText": "Starting with 2024's Galaxy S24 series, Samsung started promising seven years of software support for its new phones, following a precedent Google set with the Pixel 8. It was a surprisingly user-friendly and even environmentally conscious move, letting buyers more easily keep their phones for longer while also reducing e-waste generated from constant upgrades. Unfortunately, it didn't apply to previous models, and now we're starting to see the consequences of that.\n\nIn Samsung's February 2026 security updates (first spotted by SamMobile), the Galaxy S21, S21+, and S21 Ultra are nowhere to be seen, indicating that they've reached their end of support. The only phone from this line still listed was the S21 FE 5G, which makes sense, since it was released a year after the rest of the S21 line. That means these phones will no longer get regular monthly or quarterly security updates, although if a critical vulnerability pops up, Samsung might still issue an emergency fix.\n\nNone of this should be surprising, but it can still be confusing if you're an S21 owner. To be fair to Samsung, the company only ever pledged five years of support for the S21 series on release, and only four years of Android updates. But as far as hardware goes, your phone is probably still running just fine. The Snapdragon 888 chip powering the S21 series is snappy enough for casual use, even if it can be a bit power hungry. Do you really need to replace it, especially so soon after launch?\n\nAs far as browsing the internet, watching videos, and scrolling social media apps goes, your Galaxy S21 phone should still hold up well. Gaming and other more demanding tasks might suffer, but there shouldn't be anything physically wrong with your phone aside from aging. The problem comes when you start to consider safety.\n\nRegular security updates help patch holes hackers can use to get into your data or accounts. And these days, hackers have gotten pretty smart. While you might know to avoid sketchy websites or high-risk apps, there are exploits hackers can use now that don't need any interaction from you. Sometimes, all it takes is having a Bluetooth radio in your device, or for the hacker to know your phone number.\n\nGetting hit by one of these hacks might be rare, but it's not a good idea to leave yourself open to the possibility if you can avoid it. It's like driving in a car without a seatbelt—you probably won't get in a crash, but you'll wish you had one if you do. Upgrading to a phone getting official security updates from the manufacturer is the best way to ensure your handset has the most up-to-date safety, but if you can't, there are a few steps you can take to protect yourself.\n\nGetting over-the-air updates directly from your phone's manufacturer is the best way to stay safe while using your phone, but they're not the only way to get security updates. Starting with Android 10, which the Galaxy S21 series does fall under, Google's Project Mainline began delivering partial security updates via Google Play System Updates.\n\nThese won't close all vulnerabilities, but they do allow Google to patch holes in media codecs and components, permissions, and a few other features hackers like to exploit, even on devices that no longer get official manufacturer support. \"With Project Mainline, we can deliver faster security fixes for critical security bugs,\" the company said in a blog post. \"For example, by modularizing media components, which accounts for nearly 40% of recently patched vulnerabilities.\"\n\nProject Mainline can't fix everything, especially problems related to your specific device, but if you do find that your phone is out of date, it's worth ensuring your Google Play System Updates are updated to the most recent version until you can find a new one. How to check this will differ from device to device, but you'll generally find these updates under Settings > System > Software updates. Here, you'll see a date showing which Google Play system update your phone is running. These should normally update manually every month, but if the date looks a little old, you can simply tap it to search for a fresh update and download it.\n\nIdeally, you should take the end of software support as a sign to upgrade to a new phone, even if it appears to be working fine. But I get any hesitation you might be feeling. I'm still on Windows 10, which is facing its own security update issues, even though my device still works perfectly for everything I want from it. I'm glad to see companies catching on with extended security updates, so hopefully this will become less of an issue in the future. Tech timelines move fast, but a five-year upgrade cycle feels a lot more wasteful than even a seven-year one.\n\nFor now, though, keep in mind that any Samsung phone released before 2024 is going to face an end-of-life sooner than you might think, so it's time to start planning for it accordingly. The company might have moved on to seven years of updates now, but that promise doesn't apply retroactively. So Galaxy S22 owners, it's time to start thinking about what you'll do with your own devices next year.",

    "description": "The vision of human-level machine intelligence laid out by Alan Turing in the 1950s is now a reality. Eyes unclouded by dread or hype will help us to prepare for what comes next.",
    "fullText": "In 1950, in a paper entitled ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence’1, Alan Turing proposed his ‘imitation game’. Now known as the Turing test, it addressed a question that seemed purely hypothetical: could machines display the kind of flexible, general cognitive competence that is characteristic of human thought, such that they could pass themselves off as humans to unaware humans?\n\nThree-quarters of a century later, the answer looks like ‘yes’. In March 2025, the large language model (LLM) GPT-4.5, developed by OpenAI in San Francisco, California, was judged by humans in a Turing test to be human 73% of the time — more often than actual humans were2. Moreover, readers even preferred literary texts generated by LLMs over those written by human experts3.\n\nThis is far from all. LLMs have achieved gold-medal performance at the International Mathematical Olympiad, collaborated with leading mathematicians to prove theorems4, generated scientific hypotheses that have been validated in experiments5, solved problems from PhD exams, assisted professional programmers in writing code, composed poetry and much more — including chatting 24/7 with hundreds of millions of people around the world. In other words, LLMs have shown many signs of the sort of broad, flexible cognitive competence that was Turing’s focus — what we now call ‘general intelligence’, although Turing did not use the term.\n\nYet many experts baulk at saying that current AI models display artificial general intelligence (AGI) — and some doubt that they ever will. A March 2025 survey by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in Washington DC found that 76% of leading researchers thought that scaling up current AI approaches would be ‘unlikely’ or ‘very unlikely’ to yield AGI (see go.nature.com/4smn16b).\n\nWhat explains this disconnect? We suggest that the problem is part conceptual, because definitions of AGI are ambiguous and inconsistent; part emotional, because AGI raises fear of displacement and disruption; and part practical, as the term is entangled with commercial interests that can distort assessments. Precisely because AGI dominates public discourse, it is worth engaging with the concept in a more detached way: as a question about intelligence, rather than a pressing concern about social upheaval or an ever-postponed milestone in a business contract.\n\nIn writing this Comment, we approached this question from different perspectives — philosophy, machine learning, linguistics and cognitive science — and reached a consensus after extensive discussion. In what follows, we set out why we think that, once you clear away certain confusions, and strive to make fair comparisons and avoid anthropocentric biases, the conclusion is straightforward: by reasonable standards, including Turing’s own, we have artificial systems that are generally intelligent. The long-standing problem of creating AGI has been solved. Recognizing this fact matters — for policy, for risk and for understanding the nature of mind and even the world itself.\n\nWe assume, as we think Turing would have done, that humans have general intelligence. Some think that general intelligence does not exist at all, even in humans. Although this view is coherent and philosophically interesting, we set it aside here as being too disconnected from most AI discourse. But having made this assumption, how should we characterize general intelligence?\n\nA common informal definition of general intelligence, and the starting point of our discussions, is a system that can do almost all cognitive tasks that a human can do6,7. What tasks should be on that list engenders a lot of debate, but the phrase ‘a human’ also conceals a crucial ambiguity. Does it mean a top human expert for each task? Then no individual qualifies — Marie Curie won Nobel prizes in chemistry and physics but was not an expert in number theory. Does it mean a composite human with competence across the board? This, too, seems a high bar — Albert Einstein revolutionized physics, but he couldn’t speak Mandarin.\n\nA definition that excludes essentially all humans is not a definition of general intelligence; it is about something else, perhaps ideal expertise or collective intelligence. Rather, general intelligence is about having sufficient breadth and depth of cognitive abilities, with ‘sufficient’ anchored by paradigm cases. Breadth means abilities across multiple domains — mathematics, language, science, practical reasoning, creative tasks — in contrast to ‘narrow’ intelligences, such as a calculator or a chess-playing program. Depth means strong performance within those domains, not merely superficial engagement.\n\nHuman general intelligence admits degrees and variation. Children, average adults and an acknowledged genius such as Einstein all have general intelligence of varying level and profile. Individual humans excel or fall short in different domains. The same flexibility should apply to artificial systems: we should ask whether they have the core cognitive abilities at levels comparable to human-level general intelligence.\n\nRather than stipulating a definition, we draw on both actual and hypothetical cases of general intelligence — from Einstein to aliens to oracles — to triangulate the contours of the concept and refine it more systematically. Our conclusion: insofar as individual humans have general intelligence, current LLMs do, too.\n\nWe can start by identifying four features that are not required for general intelligence.\n\nPerfection. We don’t expect a physicist to match Einstein’s insights, or a biologist to replicate Charles Darwin’s breakthroughs. Few, if any, humans have perfect depth even within specialist areas of competence. Human general intelligence does not require perfection; neither should AGI.\n\nUniversality. No individual human can do every cognitive task, and other species have abilities that exceed our own: an octopus can control its eight arms independently; many insects can see parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that are invisible to humans. General intelligence does not require universal mastery of these skills; an AGI does not need perfect breadth.\n\nHuman similarity. Intelligence is a functional property that can be realized in different substrates — a point Turing embraced in 1950 by setting aside human biology1. Systems demonstrating general intelligence need not replicate human cognitive architecture or understand human cultural references. We would not demand these things of intelligent aliens; the same applies to machines.\n\nSuperintelligence. This is generally used to indicate any system that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in almost all areas. Superintelligence and AGI are often conflated, particularly in business contexts, in which ‘superintelligence’ often signals economic disruption. No human meets this standard; it should not be a requirement for AGI, either.\n\nWhat, then, is general intelligence? There is no ‘bright line’ test for its presence — any exact threshold is inevitably arbitrary. This might frustrate those who want exact criteria, but the vagueness is a feature, not a bug. Concepts such as ‘life’ and ‘health’ resist sharp definition yet remain useful; we recognize paradigm cases without needing exact boundaries. Humans are paradigm examples of general intelligence; a pocket calculator lacks it, despite superhuman ability at calculations.\n\nWhen we assess general intelligence or ability in other humans, we do not attempt to peer inside their heads to verify understanding — we infer it from behaviour, conversation and problem-solving. No single test is definitive, but evidence accumulates. The same applies to artificial systems.\n\nJust as we assess human general intelligence through progressively demanding tests, from basic literacy to PhD examinations, we can consider a cascade of increasingly demanding evidence that warrants progressively higher confidence in the presence of AGI.\n\nTuring-test level. Markers comparable to a basic school education: passing standard school exams, holding adequate conversations and performing simple reasoning. A decade ago, meeting these might have been widely accepted as sufficiently strong evidence for AGI.\n\nExpert level. Here, the demands escalate: gold-medal performance at international competitions, solving problems on PhD exams across multiple fields, writing and debugging complex code, fluency in dozens of languages, useful frontier research assistance as well as competent creative and practical problem-solving, from essay writing to trip planning. These achievements exceed many depictions of AGI in science fiction. The sentient supercomputer HAL 9000, from director Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, exhibited less breadth than current LLMs do. And current LLMs even exceed what we demand of humans: we credit individual people with general intelligence on the basis of much weaker evidence.\n\nSuperhuman level. Revolutionary scientific discoveries and consistent superiority over leading human experts across a range of domains. Such evidence would surely allow no reasonable debate about the presence of general intelligence in a machine — but it is not required evidence for its presence, because no human shows this.\n\nCurrent LLMs already cover the first two levels. As LLMs tackle progressively more difficult problems, alternative explanations for their capabilities — for instance, that they are gigantic ‘lookup tables’8 that retrieve pre-computed answers or ‘stochastic parrots’9 that regurgitate shallow regularities without grasping meaning or structure — become increasingly disconfirmed.\n\nOften, however, such claims just reappear with different predictions. Hypotheses that retreat before each new success, always predicting failure just beyond current achievements, are not compelling scientific theories, but a dogmatic commitment to perpetual scepticism.\n\nWe think the current evidence is clear. By inference to the best explanation — the same reasoning we use in attributing general intelligence to other people — we are observing AGI of a high degree. Machines such as those envisioned by Turing have arrived. Similar arguments have been made before10 (see also go.nature.com/49p6voq), and have engendered controversy and push-back. Our argument benefits from substantial advances and extra time. As of early 2026, the case for AGI is considerably more clear-cut.\n\nWe now examine ten common objections to the idea that current LLMs display general intelligence. Several of them echo objections that Turing himself considered in 1950. Each, we suggest, either conflates general intelligence with non-essential aspects of intelligence or applies standards that individual humans fail to meet.\n\nThey’re just parrots. The stochastic parrot objection says that LLMs merely interpolate training data. They can only recombine patterns they’ve encountered, so they must fail on genuinely new problems, or ‘out-of-distribution generalization’. This echoes ‘Lady Lovelace’s Objection’, inspired by Ada Lovelace’s 1843 remark and formulated by Turing as the claim that machines can “never do anything really new”1. Early LLMs certainly made mistakes on problems requiring reasoning and generalization beyond surface patterns in training data. But current LLMs can solve new, unpublished maths problems, perform near-optimal in-context statistical inference on scientific data11 and exhibit cross-domain transfer, in that training on code improves general reasoning across non-coding domains12. If critics demand revolutionary discoveries such as Einstein’s relativity, they are setting the bar too high, because very few humans make such discoveries either. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that human intelligence is not itself a sophisticated version of a stochastic parrot. All intelligence, human or artificial, must extract structure from correlational data; the question is how deep the extraction goes.\n\nThey lack world models. LLMs supposedly lack representations of their physical environment that are necessary for genuine understanding. But having a world model requires only the ability to predict what would happen if circumstances differed — to answer counterfactual questions. Ask a cutting-edge LLM what differs between dropping a glass or a pillow on a tile floor, and it will correctly predict shattering in one case and not the other. The ability of LLMs to solve olympiad mathematics and physics problems and assist with engineering design suggests that they possess functional models of physical principles. By these standards, LLMs already have world models. Furthermore, neural networks developed for specialized domains such as autonomous driving are already learning predictive models of physical scenes that support counterfactual reasoning and sophisticated physical awareness13.\n\nThey understand only words. This objection centres on the fact that LLMs are trained only on text, and so must be fundamentally limited to text-based tasks. Frontier models are now trained on images and other multimodal data, making this objection somewhat obsolete. Moreover, language is humanity’s most powerful tool for compressing and capturing knowledge about reality. LLMs can extract this compressed knowledge and apply it to distinctly non-linguistic tasks: helping researchers to design experiments — for example, suggesting what to test next in biology and materials science4 — goes beyond merely linguistic performance. We are yet to encounter the sharp limitations to LLM performance that this objection predicts.\n\nThey don’t have bodies. Without embodiment, critics argue, there can be no general intelligence. This reflects an anthropocentric bias that seems to be wielded only against AI. People would ascribe intelligence to a disembodied alien communicating by radio, or to a brain sustained in a vat. An entity that responds accurately to any question, but never moves or acts physically, would be regarded as profoundly intelligent. Physicist Stephen Hawking interacted with the world almost entirely through text and synthesized speech, yet his physical limitations in no way diminished his intelligence. Motor capabilities are separable from general intelligence.\n\nThey lack agency. It is true that present-day LLMs do not form independent goals or initiate action unprompted, as humans do. Even ‘agentic’ AI systems — such as frontier coding agents — typically act only when a user triggers a task, even if they can then automatically draft features and fix bugs. But intelligence does not require autonomy. Like the Oracle of Delphi — understood as a system that produces accurate answers only when queried — current LLMs need not initiate goals to count as intelligent. Humans typically have both general intelligence and autonomy, but we should not thereby conclude that one requires the other. Autonomy matters for moral responsibility, but it is not constitutive of intelligence.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-026-00285-6\n\nTuring, A. M.

    "title": "That Text About a Suspicious Apple Pay Transaction Is Probably a Scam",
    "description": "Apple doesn't reach out to its users that way.",
    "fullText": "A new phishing scam is targeting Apple Pay users, attempting to lock them into phony support calls or emails that could see them handing over their passwords and credit card numbers. The news was first highlighted by AppleInsider and involves warnings that look suspiciously like official Apple messaging. While AppleInsider's report doesn't link to any specific user complaints of this happening, it does include example screenshots, and reports matching AppleInsider's description have popped up on both Reddit and Apple's official support forums over the last 30 days.\n\nThe scam might come over either email or text, and usually warns the recipient about a potentially fraudulent purchase made using their Apple Pay at a physical Apple Store, while offering a phone number or email to contact to address the issue. According to AppleInsider, it might also include a case ID, timestamp, or other technical details in order to appear more legitimate. One user on Reddit, for instance, considered that the scam might be a legitimate text from Apple because it included the official sounding phrase \"If this was you, no action is needed.\"\n\nHowever, inconsistencies remain, such as the scam often referring to Apple Accounts as Apple IDs, a now outdated term. Additionally, while emails might use official looking letterhead that makes them appear to come straight from Apple, mistakes could remain. For instance, an email could open with \"Hello {Name}\" instead of being addressed to the recipient's actual name. It could come from a bogus address, but even appearing to come from a legitimate source like \"[email protected]\" isn't a strong indicator that it's real, as it's possible for scammers to spoof email addresses. Overall, the idea seems to be to speed the recipient into action with an urgent tone, while using Apple's logo and a professional writing style to mask any clues as to who is really sending these notices.\n\nIf you are receiving any texts or emails about your Apple Pay activity at all, chances are they probably aren't real—Apple doesn't reach out to its users in this way. Rather than sending texts or emails, communication instead comes directly from the Wallet app. Additionally, Apple Pay serves as a medium for payment rather than as a credit or debit account in and of itself. As such, if any fraudulent transactions are detected, notices would come from your bank or credit card provider rather than Apple itself.\n\nStill, it is worth keeping an eye out for any red flags as well. Look for small typos or unusual domain names, which can help give a fake message away, even if a lack of these isn't an indicator that a message is legitimate. Also, rather than calling any provided phone numbers, consider searching for them online to see whether they've been reported as being tied to a scam operation. At any rate, do not respond to these notices, and don't provide any information (such as passwords, which Apple will never ask for) to them if you've already reached out by accident. There are better ways to verify your Apple Pay activity.\n\nIf you think a message you've received is illegitimate, the best thing you can do is ignore it and verify it independently. Instead of responding to the suspicious text or email directly, or calling any provided phone numbers, double check any claims made in the statement through official Apple channels. You can see your recent Apple Pay purchases in the Wallet app by tapping on one of your registered cards, and opening the Settings app and navigating to Media & Purchases > View Account > Purchase History will show you any recent App Store purchases. If you don't see a transaction mentioned in one of these notices in your official payment history, chance are it never happened.\n\nIf you're still in doubt you have options. Rather than reaching out to an email or phone number linked in a potential scam notice, start fresh with a new message straight to Apple's official support. You can find the proper contact details, including an official Apple phone number for your region, on Apple's website. The company will be able to determine whether it's seen any suspicious activity tied to your account.\n\nFinally, once you're certain a message is part of a scam, you can forward it (or simply report it, if forwarding isn't possible) to Apple to help the company shut it down. The specific email address you'll want to use will differ based on the type of message, and you can find all your options on Apple's support website, under \"How to report suspicious emails, messages, and calls.\" Once you've sent the message to the correct channels, delete it from your inbox to keep yourself from accidentally clicking any compromised links. As added security, also consider changing your Apple Account password, or using a password manager.",

    "fullText": "Swansea Council says it has been told that regional rugby in Swansea will not exist beyond the end of next season if a takeover of Cardiff by Ospreys' owners Y11 Sport & Media is successful.\n\nIn a statement after a meeting with Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) and Ospreys officials, the council said it had issued a pre-action legal letter to the WRU and Y11, warning of legal action if the restructure of Welsh professional rugby was not paused.\n\nThe WRU wants to reduce the number of men's professional teams in Wales from four to three, which could be achieved by eliminating Ospreys as a top-tier side through a takeover process of Cardiff by Ospreys' owners Y11 Sport & Media.\n\nThe WRU said the Swansea Council statement was inaccurate, but confirmed it had received the pre-action legal letter.\n\nOspreys say \"no decisions have been made regarding Ospreys' future after the 2026-27 season, and no statements have been made by Lance Bradley [chief executive] or anyone else associated with Ospreys which contradict that.\"\n\nY11 have also been asked to comment.\n\nA public meeting to discuss the Ospreys' future was held on Wednesday evening hosted by Swansea Council, which former Ospreys players such as Alun Wyn Jones, James King, Andrew Bishop and Paul James attended along with hundreds of people.\n\nSwansea Council had said it would publish the minutes of the meeting, which took place on 22 January, but in its most recent statement claimed they had not done so because the WRU, Y11, and Ospreys objected to it.\n\nThe 22 January meeting included officials from Swansea Council, the WRU chief executive Abi Tierney, and Ospreys chief executive Lance Bradley.\n\nIn a statement, the council listed a number of what it called \"key facts\" that it claims were said at the 22 January meeting.\n\nThe statement includes that Bradley confirmed there would not be a professional Ospreys team playing regional rugby after 2027 if the takeover of Cardiff by Y11 went ahead.\n\nIt is claimed that Bradley also said a merger with Swansea RFC could follow, which would see a team competing in the semi professional Super Rygbi Cymru instead of the United Rugby Championship (URC).\n\nThe council statement said: \"Council representatives left the (22 January) meeting with a clear understanding that the basis of the WRU's and Y11's proposals for the future, if the acquisition of Cardiff Rugby by Y11 is completed, was that the Ospreys would not continue as a professional regional team after 2026-27.\n\n\"The council expressed deep frustration that, despite extensive and recent discussions about the redevelopment of St Helen's, it had not been informed earlier of these proposals. This lack of transparency and engagement is wholly unacceptable.\"\n\nThe council claim that the WRU's restructuring proposals would breach UK competition law and has issued pre-action letters to the WRU and Y11 requesting that they pause their plans.\n\nThe WRU has proposed cutting one of its four men's professional sides - Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets - to three.\n\nThe WRU has stated there will be one licence in Cardiff, one in the west and one in the east, with Llanelli-based Scarlets, and Dragons in Newport, expected to be handed those.\n\nOspreys fans ramp up protest against WRU and Y11\n\nWRU accused of 'malicious cultural vandalism'\n\nWelsh rugby crisis - Who, what, why and where next?\n\nOspreys will continue playing in the URC and Europe next season, but their future beyond the end of the 2026-27 campaign looks even \n\nThere has been ongoing uncertainty around what will happen with the £5m development St Helen's ground in Swansea, that was set to be the Ospreys' new home from the start of next season.\n\nSwansea Council, which is funding the project, said its legal action would be aimed at safeguarding the future of regional rugby in the city.\n\nIn its pre-action legal letter, Swansea Council said the decision to cut the number of regions was \"a restriction of competition and has not been carried out in a fair, transparent or non-discriminatory way\".\n\nIt also said that the WRU's ownership of Cardiff created a \"clear conflict of interest\".\n\nThe council has asked for a response to its pre-action letter by 13 February.\n\n\"Coming out of the meeting we were clear on what we were told, we felt the public had a right to understand what the conclusion of that meeting meant,\" said Rob Stewart, leader of Swansea council told BBC Wales.\n\n\"We've respected parts of the meeting, but there are some clear themes around the fact the decisions seems to have been made to end regional rugby here in Swansea.\n\n\"We felt the public of Swansea deserved to know what the proposals were.\n\n\"There was not an agreement to all parts of the minutes between the Ospreys and the WRU.\n\n\"So we felt it better to put out a statement that was not challengeable in terms of legal aspects, rather focus on the main themes and conclusions, which are not in doubt.\n\n\"We're continuing to support the Ospreys, to continue seeing them play regional rugby here in Swansea, but that does mean having a legal challenge towards the WRU and Y11.\"\n\nWhen asked whether a legal challenge was the best use of public money, Stewart said: \"For our region here, there's in excess of £12m of direct impact to the economy... All of that is at risk so it is in the public interest, and as a public body we have to stand up for what's right.\n\n\"We will continue to fight on behalf of the people of Swansea.\"\n\nThe WRU said: \"We can confirm that we have received a pre-action letter from Swansea Council, alongside a public statement which is inaccurate in reference to a recent meeting we attended.\n\n\"As you will understand we will be taking our own advice and so cannot comment on this at this time.\n\n\"This WRU board has worked in good faith since it took office some two years ago to create a new way forward for Welsh rugby given the significant financial and performance issues we are all facing.\n\n\"We appreciate that these are difficult issues for everyone concerned, but we have conducted ourselves with future long term success in mind.\"\n\nOspreys say they noted the statement from Swansea Council regarding discussions on the future of regional rugby in Wales.\n\nThe Ospreys statement said: \"As has been stated previously, Ospreys continues to operate as a professional club and is focused on supporting its players, staff, and supporters while competing in the URC under existing agreements.\n\n\"No decisions have been made regarding Ospreys' future after the 2026-27 season, and no statements have been made by Lance Bradley or anyone else associated with Ospreys which contradict that.\n\n\"Given the sensitivity of these matters, and the fact that they involve multiple parties and ongoing discussions, it would be inappropriate for Ospreys Rugby to comment on interpretations of meetings, unfinalised proposals, or legal correspondence.\n\n\"Ospreys Rugby remains committed to constructive engagement with all stakeholders and will communicate directly and transparently when there is confirmed information to share.\"",

We both know what we need to do,\" Chisora said.\n\n\"I don't want to sell this fight with violence, because there's too much violence in the world right now.\"\n\nChisora admitted the mood will switch in fight week, but also said he might go on holiday to Alabama, where Wilder lives, with his family after the bout.\n\nThe 42-year-old, who took to the stage draped in a UK flag and bandana, continually described Wilder as his \"brother\", while the American said the fight was \"must-win\" for him.\n\nChisora intends to retire after his 50th contest, while Wilder hopes to make a final run at becoming a two-time heavyweight champion.\n\n\"I need this fight. I need Derek more than he needs me because of what he brings to the table. I feel like I'm back,\" Wilder said.\n\n\"I've been broken down and built back up again. I'm looking forward to it and can't wait.\"\n\nThe heavyweight bout will intrigue the boxing public and is likely to draw a sellout crowd to the O2 as only the second time Wilder will fight in the UK, but will compete with two other shows for attention that weekend in the country.\n\nLauren Price defends her welterweight world title in Cardiff on the same night, before Caroline Dubois and Terri Harper contest a lightweight unification bout in London on 5 April.\n\nWilder, 40, stands at a career crossroads with four losses in his past six bouts.\n\nSuccessive defeats by Joseph Parker and then Zhilei Zhang prompted a year-long lay-off from the sport.\n\nWilder said he attended therapy during that period because of \"problems outside the ring\" and felt he was \"mentally done for\" preparing for his recent fights.\n\nHe returned in June last year to knock out the unheralded Tyrrell Anthony Herndon in seven rounds and could secure a world title fight with a win over Chisora.\n\n\"You want to fight Oleksandr Usyk, I am the gatekeeper,\" Chisora said.\n\nChisora intends to bring the curtain down on a professional career that has spanned 19 years and 346 rounds.\n\nIt is not the first time the two-time world title challenger has branded a fight as his swansong, but when promoter Frank Warren suggested there could be another bout in him if he wins, Chisora interrupted, saying: \"I am, please, please, please.\"\n\nThe first face-off passed without incident, Wilder and Chisora holding more of a conversation for a minute than a stare-down, before the Bronze Bomber brought proceedings to a close by shouting his catch phrase: \"Bomb squad.\"\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "fullText": "Seven years after they lifted a sixth Lombardi Trophy, the New England Patriots have come roaring back to relevance to make Super Bowl 60, and the rest of the NFL is nervous.\n\nFor two decades Tom Brady and Bill Belichick mercilessly terrorised the league year after year, winning those six Super Bowl titles from nine appearances in an era of unrivalled dominance.\n\nFinally relief came, as Brady departed, Belichick followed and the dynasty crumbled into obscurity as four-win also-rans with seemingly no way back.\n\nBut then, a meteoric return to the top this season, powered by head coach Mike Vrabel and quarterback Drake Maye, has plenty of NFL fans backing the Seattle Seahawks at Super Bowl 60 in Santa Clara on Sunday, doing so out of pure fear at the thought of the league's 'evil empire' rising again.\n\nBill Belichick: A Super Bowl god's fall from grace\n\nBelichick's Hall of Fame exclusion 'ridiculous'\n\nIn a league built to promote parity, the Patriots continually found ways to win - missing the play-offs just twice during Brady and Belichick's 19 seasons together, and one of those the legendary quarterback missed through injury.\n\nThere were 18 divisional titles, 13 Conference Championship appearances leading to nine Super Bowls and Lombardis - a definition of dominance that still has NFL fans suffering with PTSD (Patriots Traumatic Stress Disorder).\n\nBelichick masterminded a top-10 defence 16 times and Brady led a top-eight offence for 14 straight years, including one of the best in history in 2007 that came up a Super Bowl short of a 19-0 perfect season.\n\nA snarling, hooded Belichick was all business all the time and slipped into the villain role with ease, so some NFL fans rejoiced when Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs came to the rescue, playing the role of Luke Skywalker and the rebel alliance to help defeat the evil Patriot empire.\n\nAnd that looked like it would be that as Belichick struggled without Brady. A rare first-round pick spent on Mac Jones in 2021 proved a false dawn as the Pats made the play-offs but were thrashed by Josh Allen's Buffalo.\n\nA 4-13 season saw the end of Belichick's tenure, and former Pats linebacker Jerod Mayo could only produce the same 4-13 finish that ended his stint after just one season.\n\nThree straight years without the play-offs was the team's longest run since the early 1990s, and in the final two they were not even close - ranking near the bottom of the league in almost every metric.\n\nOwner Robert Kraft turned to another former Patriots linebacker, but one with vital head coaching experience in Mike Vrabel, and he has led a record 10-win turnaround that has the Patriots back on their perch.\n\nAnd the rest of the NFL fearing that the empire could be about to strike back.\n\nKraft deserves credit for acting quickly and switching head coaches as Vrabel looked the perfect fit.\n\nSteeped in the 'Patriot way' of doing things, the three-time Super Bowl winner knows how to get he job done but, unlike Mayo, he had the crucial experience of leading the Tennessee Titans to the AFC Championship game during his spell in Nashville.\n\nVrabel was the most wanted head coach of the cycle last year and Maye has shown flashes during his rookie year that he had franchise quarterback potential. The two have proven to be a match made in heaven.\n\nA head coach who built on fierce defence, and a second-year quarterback with a knack for producing the right plays at the right time - that's just one of the similarities with the 2001 Patriots, the first Super Bowl win of the Brady-Belichick era.\n\nThe combination was promising enough for Kraft to sanction the biggest outlay in the league in free agency, with $364m splashed out on new talent - and crucially most of them have been hits.\n\nCoupled with some seriously good drafting, the new head coach and improving sophomore quarterback have landed in a perfect storm in a total Patriots reboot - with just 16 players left in the squad from a couple of years ago.\n\nThey had the second-most snaps played by rookies this season and a total of 416 regular season games by players in their first year in Foxborough - a record for a team reaching a Super Bowl.\n\nPerhaps Vrabel being new as well has helped so many new faces all knit together, but however it worked it's certainly been a recipe for success as they've all delivered.\n\nThe team's leading receiver Stefon Diggs, top tackler and defensive play-caller Robert Spillane, top sack leader Harold Landry and defensive giant Milton Williams all arrived in free agency last summer.\n\nTheir regular season rushing leader TreVeyon Henderson came out of the 2025 NFL Draft and the Patriots will be the first team ever to start two rookies on the offensive line in Will Campbell and Marcus Bryant.\n\nIt's been as clinical in the Patriots front office as it has on the field, and it has New England one game away from a record seventh Super Bowl title.\n\nWill Seahawks stop Patriots' record bid? Lowdown on Super Bowl 2026\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'\n\nFor those who had their Super Bowl dreams dashed by the Patriots in the past, there are some uneasy similarities with how Vrabel and Maye have emulated the Brady and Belichick axis.\n\nAt just 23, Maye could become the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl so he's younger than Brady was, but both have made the big game in their second season.\n\nMaye is just the third quarterback to make the Super Bowl after generating under 17 points on offence in multiple play-off games - Brady's 2001 Pats offence failed to put 17 on the board in all three games.\n\nWeather played a part in all three play-off games but Vrabel's defence was still excellent and coming through such tight encounters like that in the post-season is exactly how Brady and Belichick made their names.\n\nIn fact, New England's win over Denver was just the fourth time since 2001 that a quarterback generated 14 points or fewer on offence and still won a Championship game or Super Bowl - Brady was part of the other three.\n\nMaye spreads the ball out like Brady used to, with nine players this season having at least 200 receiving yards, and often pops up with the crucial play at the crucial time, albeit more with his legs than his arm.\n\nOf Maye's 16 runs in the play-offs, 12 have gone for a touchdown or first down - Brady had the same kind of magic in his arm to lead his team's to glory.\n\nSo a tough, defensive coach, a talented, focused quarterback happy to win any way possible, some key drafting and expert free agent pick-ups have resulted in a team able to blow teams away or grind out tough play-off wins home and away.\n\nThat sure sounds familiar, and it will be a familiar sight in Santa Clara as the Patriots will have appeared in 20% of all Super Bowls come Sunday - and the concern for the rest of the NFL is that this could be just the start.\n\nWhen is Super Bowl 2026? Kick-off time, half-time show and BBC coverage\n\nThe road to Super Bowl 60 - how Patriots and Seahawks got there",

    "description": "George Clinton, while working as a barber, recruited him. Mr. Nelson went on to name the group and, with his bandmates, to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.",
    "fullText": "Billy Bass Nelson, who turned a part-time job sweeping floors for a New Jersey barber named George Clinton into a gig as the first bassist for Funkadelic, Mr. Clinton’s groundbreaking band that melded R&B, funk and acid rock into a groovalicious exploration of the furthest reaches of the musical universe, died on Saturday. He was 75.\n\nHis death was announced by the Facebook page for George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic, which did not provide a location or cause. Mr. Nelson had been in hospice care. Some news outlets and other sources erroneously reported last week that he had died.\n\nFunkadelic, which eventually merged with its sibling band the Parliaments, represented an enormous leap forward in the fusion of musical styles taking place in the late 1960s and ’70s. What began with Mr. Nelson and two other musicians grew into a sprawling, rotating lineup of artists whose joyfully riotous music was matched by extravagant, drug-fueled live shows.\n\nMr. Nelson was among the 16 members of the Parliament-Funkadelic collective — or P-Funk — who were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nMr. Nelson began as the bassist in the backup band for the Parliaments, Mr. Clinton’s doo-wop quintet that entertained audiences across New Jersey in the late 1950s and ’60s. To play guitar, he recruited his friend Eddie Hazel, who also went on to star in various P-Funk lineups.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Clinton, who was later known for his outlandish onstage clothing choices — including no clothing at all — wore dinner jackets and had his hair straightened. Mr. Nelson, a decade younger, was \n\nTired of being in a nameless backup band, in 1967 Mr. Nelson came up with Funkadelic, drawing on the two genres that he was trying to meld: funk and psychedelic rock.\n\nThe balance of power between the crooners and the funksters in the group shifted in 1968, after a dispute with Motown, the Parliaments’ record label, prevented them from using the name the Parliaments, or simply Parliament, for several years.\n\nThe pragmatic Mr. Clinton, seeing the way the cultural tide was shifting, hung up his dinner jacket and embraced the new direction Mr. Nelson was charting.\n\nMr. Nelson’s influence is all over Funkadelic’s first three albums, “Funkadelic” (1970), “Free Your Mind … and Your Ass Will Follow” (1970) and “Maggot Brain” (1971). He co-wrote and sang on several tracks, including “Super Stupid,” one of the band’s first signature tracks, from the album “Maggot Brain.”\n\nHe also embraced Mr. Clinton’s no-limits approach to live performances. Tired of being considered the baby of the group — he was the youngest — Mr. Nelson devised an oversize diaper to wear onstage, a look that several bandmates later adopted.\n\n“I had these long braids, bare chested, the diaper and my combat boots,” he told LA Weekly in 1996. “And sometimes I had a tuxedo jacket and tails to go with it.”\n\nFollowing a financial dispute with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Nelson left the band soon after “Maggot Brain” was released. He then played backup for a number of other groups, most extensively the Temptations; his playing featured prominently in their last major hit, “Shakey Ground” (1975). He also occasionally rejoined Mr. Clinton, though the two never fully resolved their differences.\n\n“I’ll get the platinum and gold records if I get a chance,” Mr. Nelson told The Courier-News of Bridgewater, N.J., in 1997, following his induction into the Hall of Fame. “And I don’t need George. I could do it without George.”\n\nWilliam Nelson Jr. was born on Jan. 26, 1951, in Plainfield, N.J., to William and Cora Nelson.\n\nLike many neighborhood teens, he hung out at the local barbershop, where Mr. Clinton cut hair while trying to get the Parliaments off the ground. During practice sessions, Mr. Clinton recruited Mr. Nelson and other teenagers to play backup after several older musicians were drafted into the U.S. Army.\n\nMr. Clinton eventually signed a contract with Motown, but when the company declined to record the Parliaments, he signed with another label, Revilot, and produced what became the group’s first hit, “(I Wanna) Testify” (1967).\n\nThe Parliaments went on tour, taking along their young backup band, which now included Mr. Hazel, the guitarist Tawl Ross and the drummer Tiki Fulwood.\n\nFor a time, Funkadelic became something of an alter ego for the Parliaments; the same roster would perform under one name or the other, depending on the style of music being played.\n\n“We took the rhythm and blues and the funk that was already there, and we took it to another level,” Mr. Nelson said in the 2016 documentary “Tear the Roof Off: The Untold Story of Parliament Funkadelic.”\n\nMr. Clinton recovered the right to the Parliament name in 1974. He began to use the two names interchangeably, or in tandem, as Parliament-Funkadelic, or P-Funk for short. He also spun off a variety of subsidiary acts, like the female duo the Brides of Funkenstein.\n\nMr. Nelson returned in 1975 to play on Funkadelic’s song “Better by the Pound,” and in the 1990s to play live shows with the P-Funk All-Stars, which had evolved from the original band, though only Mr. Clinton remained from the original lineup.\n\nMr. Nelson also played bass for a number of R&B acts, including the Commodores, Lionel Richie and the ska-punk band Fishbone.\n\nAfter a brief hiatus to work as a computer operator, he released a solo album, “Out of the Dark,” under the name O.G. Funk, in 1994.\n\nMr. Nelson’s survivors include his daughter, Ebony Nelson, and his sister, Alise Nelson.\n\nLong after he left Funkadelic, Mr. Nelson continued to have strong ideas about the proper way to play funk.\n\n“Funk is meant to be played at a very specific tempo,” he told Guitar Player magazine in 1996. “A lot of groups play ‘funk’ licks and do ‘funk’ things, like thumbing the bass and all, but they play it all too fast. If you want to play that raw, serious funk, you have to slow it down.”",

    "fullText": "International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry says it must \"be better\" on climate change after receiving a petition signed by more than 21,000 people who want to stop fossil fuel companies from sponsoring winter sports.\n\nThe petition - delivered on Wednesday and with athletes among the signatories - comes as Italy's Eni, one of the world's seven biggest oil companies, is a 'premium partner' of the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nIt follows reports that the number of countries which could reliably host a Winter Olympics will hugely reduce in the future because of climate change.\n\nAsked by the BBC whether she is disappointed by the Games having high-carbon sponsors, Coventry said: \"It's really nice athletes have a platform to speak up.\n\n\"The petition, I know they met with our team today and we are having conversations in order to be better, and for our stakeholders to be better. But that takes time.\"\n\nChristophe Dubi, the IOC executive director for the Olympic Games, added: \"We make a point to receive those petitions, and we have to recognise climate is a challenge for all of us.\n\n\"What we have to do as an organisation is to be at the forefront of sustainability, and our principles are very clear.\"\n\nOne area the IOC is aiming to make the Olympics more sustainable is having Games take place over a wider area with more pre-existing facilities, and Coventry said Milan-Cortina is an acid test for whether this is a viable future.\n\nMilan-Cortina takes place in three hubs spread across northern Italy - in Milan, Cortina and Livigno - with only two newly built sporting facilities: the Santagiulia ice hockey arena and Cortina Sliding Centre.\n\nThe next two Winter Olympics - French Alps 2030 and Utah 2034 - will also have sports spread more widely, while the 2032 Summer Olympics in Brisbane is will have venues across Queensland.\n\nThis has caused issues however, with Brisbane organisers saying, external they will go beyond the originally stated budget of $4.9bn (£3.6bn).\n\n\"We are really experiencing a spread out Games here for the first time - we are going to learn a lot,\" Coventry said.\n\n\"We have taken this decision for sustainability reasons, climate and not having to have new venues. We are seeing there is an impact on National Olympic Committees because of the spreadness [sic], also for broadcast and media, making it harder to get around.\n\n\"What is really cool is that you get to see iconic venues in beautiful places - but now we have to weigh this up, the balance between a spread games for sustainability reasons but not shifting complexity and sustainability to different areas.\"\n\nWhile the action got underway on Wednesday with the start of the curling events, the 2026 Winter Olympics will officially start with the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nCoventry said she hoped all nations would be treated with respect by spectators, including the USA team amid criticism from Italian authorities about the presence of ICE agents in Milan.\n\n\"I hope the opening ceremony is seen by everyone as a chance to be respectful,\" she said.\n\n\"For me, when we went to the Olympic village that is the best reminder of how the Games should be. I hope the opening ceremony will do that.\"\n\nFear and Hall named 2026 Team GB flagbearers\n\nRussian athletes linked to pro-war activity\n\nQuiz: Name every sport at the 2026 Winter Olympics",

You could tell because there's a whole bunch of software companies whose stock prices are under a lot of pressure because somehow AI is going to replace them. It is the most illogical thing in the world and time will prove itself.\"\n\nHuang outlined his view that software is a tool for AI to use, rather than replace, explaining that AI will use the tools software offers rather than reinventing its own.\n\nThe CEO named Service Now, SAP, Cadence, and Synopsis, specifically as bright spots in the space.\n\nRecent weakness in the software sector comes amid a broader market rotation away from tech.

    "fullText": "Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola wants the English Football League to change their rules to allow Marc Guehi to play in the Carabao Cup final against Arsenal.\n\nGuehi was ineligible to play as City completed a 5-1 aggregate victory over Newcastle in Wednesday's semi-final second leg and is also set to miss out when they take on the Gunners on 22 March at Wembley.\n\nCity signed the 25-year-old England centre-back from Crystal Palace after their 2-0 first leg win over the Magpies.\n\nHowever, competition rules dictate that he had to have joined them \"prior to the closure of the Winter transfer window, or the first leg of the semi-final (whichever is sooner)\" to be eligible to play.\n\n\"Hopefully we can convince the Carabao Cup that Marc [Guehi] can play the final. I don't understand why he cannot play the final,\" Guardiola said.\n\n\"You buy a player for a lot of money and he is not able to play for a rule I don't understand. Hopefully they can change it,\" he added.\n\nCity's other January signing, winger Antoine Semenyo, arrived at the club from Bournemouth four days prior to their trip to the north east for the first leg against Newcastle, in which he scored.\n\n\"Antoine arrived before the first [game] so could play. And now it's the final. Why should he [Guehi] not play? Why not? We pay his salary, he is our player,\" Guardiola added.\n\n\"I said to the club, they have to ask, definitely. I don't understand the reason why he cannot play in the final in March, when I have been here for a long time.\n\n\"The rules to buy a player depends on Fifa, Uefa, the Premier League who say, OK the transfer window is open, when you buy a player you have to play, no? It's logic. Of course we are going to try to ask [for] him to play. Pure logic.\n\nAsked what he thought the answer will be from the EFL, City's Spanish boss, added: \"No. But we will try.\"\n\nCity have already benefited from one rule change this season that allowed players to play for two teams in the same competition, instead of being cup tied.\n\nThat allowed Semenyo and Max Alleyne to feature in the semi-final matches, despite appearing for Bournemouth and Watford respectively in previous rounds.\n\nInside Man City's rebuild and plan for life without Guardiola\n\nLatest Manchester City news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man City - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Consistency is the next step for Rangers winger Mikey Moore after a standout performance against Kilmarnock, says head coach Danny Rohl.",
    "fullText": "\"He's been the best player on the pitch.\"\n\nOn the night Andreas Skov Olsen netted his first Rangers goal, scoring in a win that took the Ibrox side to within three points of the Scottish Premiership summit, it was the winger on the opposite flank who staked his claim to become a guaranteed starter in Danny Rohl's side.\n\nIn the aftermath of Sunday's goalless draw at Hibernian, Rangers' lack of creativity from open play came into focus again.\n\nTeenage Mikey Moore, signed on loan from Tottenham Hotspur in the summer, was the only bright spark in Rohl's attack during a blunt display in Leith.\n\nIt was a cameo that had sections of the Rangers support questioning why the 18-year-old had not started, but he was presented that opportunity against Kilmarnock three days later.\n\nWithin three minutes, the teenager had perfectly threaded a pass through for Djeidi Gassama to win a spot-kick, resulting in an early red card for the visitors and a goal from captain James Tavernier.\n\nTerrorising the Kilmarnock defence throughout, the Spurs youngster then registered a second-half assist for Skov Olsen before capping off a sublime performance with a goal that proved to be the final kick of a thumping 5-1 win.\n\n\"It's what he deserves,\" former Rangers striker Steven Naismith said after Moore's left-foot strike hit the far corner.\n\nWatch: Rangers v Kilmarnock Sportscene highlights\n\nVisit our Rangers page for all the latest news, analysis and fan views\n\nGet Rangers news notifications in the BBC Sport app\n\nA goal, an assist and five chances created.\n\nThat alone tells the story of a busy night for Moore, whose midweek appearance at Ibrox was just his 13th league start of the season.\n\nThe forward is building a promising relationship on the Rangers left with full-back Jayden Meghoma, while Rohl can also be encouraged with how he combined with winter signings Skov Olsen and Tuur Rommens during their exciting cameos.\n\nHowever, former Rangers forward Rory Loy was particularly impressed with the youngster's movement.\n\nDriving to the byeline, jinking in off the left, and also finding himself space in central areas, Loy described Moore's movement as \"nothing short of sensational\".\n\nSpeaking on BBC Sportsound, he added: \"Two or three passes before he gets the ball, defenders don't know where he is.\n\n\"It's been a masterclass in how to receive the ball in tight areas. He can go both ways, which keeps defenders guessing.\"\n\nFellow BBC Scotland pundit Naismith added: \"He's so direct, he's confident, he's going at [the Kilmarnock defence] and he's enjoying himself out there.\"\n\nMoore's team-mates created just seven chances between them at Hibs on Sunday.\n\nHe registered five alone on Wednesday, while his seven dribbles were also higher than any other player.\n\nGame state has to come into that, of course. At the weekend, Rangers were playing against 11 men, away to a top-six side. Struggling Kilmarnock were a man and a goal down after a few minutes on Wednesday.\n\nA goal-scoring performance from the England youth international in the Old Firm derby win at Celtic last month looked set to ignite his Ibrox career, but seven games without a goal contribution followed.\n\nDespite that, the Ibrox side just appear a livelier and more unpredictable proposition with Moore in the line-up.\n\nA mid-season injury and squad rotation has meant Moore has failed to feature in 12 of Rangers' 25 league matches, but Rohl is now demanding consistency as his side attempt to reel Hearts in.\n\n\"We know Mikey, that should be the level for him again and again,\" the Rangers head coach told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"This is the next step for him, consistency. But I will not speak about individual performances, it's about the team.\"",

    "fullText": "Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds overcame a power cut and the loss of the first end to get Team GB's Winter Olympics off to a winning start in the mixed doubles curling against Norway.\n\nThe Scottish duo, who are considered serious medal contenders in this event, cut relaxed figures inside the quirky, partially-wooden Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium in Italy, which was built for the 1956 Games.\n\nEven the loss of light in parts of the venue during an ugly opening end didn't discomfit last year's world silver medallists, who took three in the second end and would never trail again in the first of their nine round-robin matches.\n\nMouat and Dodds ultimately won 8-6 to right the wrongs of the 2022 semi-final, in which they spurned a lead to lose to the Norwegian pair before going on to be beaten by Sweden in the bronze-medal match.\n\nAnd it sets them up nicely for Thursday's ties against Estonia (09:05 GMT) and the Czechs (18:05) - both of whom lost their openers - live across the BBC.\n\nWinter Olympics day-by-day guide\n\n'Don't be afraid of being different, it's your superpower'\n\nThe pounding music and disco lights lent a sense of occasion to the first action of this year's Games in the high-end Italian resort of Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nThe snow which had hammered down all day in the Dolomites had turned to sleet by the time the four matches started in front of a healthy crowd inside the 3,500-capacity arena.\n\nBut many of those spectators were cast into darkness for four or five minutes early on until someone put some change in the meter, the scoring screens flickered back into life and play resumed.\n\n\"I didn't mind the lights going off,\" said Mouat. \"It was a bit of a boogie, a rave... it was like a nightclub.\"\n\nWhen the dancing stopped, Norway's husband and wife team of Magnus Nedregotten and Kristin Skaslien initially took control before the sides fell into a cagey contest.\n\nMouat and Dodds seized the initiative in a splendid second end - the final accounting reached after some lengthy deliberation with the measuring stick - and led 4-3 at the break after edging a tight fourth against the 2002 silver medallists.\n\nThe interval did check the momentum of the childhood friends a little, as Norway - who also won bronze in 2018 - drew level again.\n\nNedregotten's flawless play was keeping Norway in it - wife Skaslien's struggles threatening a little domestic disharmony - but even his efforts could not prevent Team GB snatching three in the sixth end thanks to a stunning Dodds throw.\n\nThat opened a three-shot lead with two ends to play.\n\nAnd, although the Norwegians invoked the powerplay to cut the deficit to one, Mouat and Dodds did likewise in the last end to close out a statement 8-6 win.\n\n\"It took us a bit of time to work out one end was curling more than the other, but once we did we took a step up in performance and took control from there,\" Dodds said.\n\n\"It's a good confidence builder to start the week.\"",

That's how one woman described the storm she's living through—financial, emotional, and structural—after discovering her husband was secretly funneling his \"fun money\" into conversations with a woman behind bars.\n\nThe story unraveled during a recent episode of \"The Ramsey Show,\" where co-hosts Rachel Cruze and George Kamel took a call from a woman named Caroline.

While he initially claimed he was \"trapped,\" Kamel pushed back hard: \"No, he wasn't trapped. He was willfully doing this on his own volition.\"\n\nCruze confirmed the obvious question: yes, it was the same incarcerated woman the entire time. The money, Caroline later learned, was used to fund commissary accounts or similar prison expenses.\n\n\"He just got caught up in it,\" she said. \"But he never told me—he just kept hiding it.\"\n\nAnd for Caroline, the emotional betrayal wasn't the only wreckage to deal with. Shortly after uncovering the truth, a tree fell on their home. \"So we were dealing with a hole in our marriage and a hole in our house,\" she said.

    "title": "Trump may have shot himself in the foot at the Fed, as Powell could stay on while Miran resigns from White House post",
    "description": "The Democrat roadblock was expected but “raises the prospect of Chair Powell staying on as FOMC chair (not Board of Governors chair) beyond May,” noted UBS.",
    "fullText": "President Trump’s plans for a more receptive Fed may have backfired so spectacularly that Jerome Powell may end up staying as chairman beyond the end of his term, while Stephen Miran, Trump’s most loyal supporter on the bank’s rate-setting committee, leaves the institution. \n\nTrump has repeatedly taken aim at the chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve—often via personal insults—since launching his presidential bid. First, he wanted Powell to hold interest rates higher to avoid boosting President Biden’s ratings on the economy. After he won the Oval Office, he began lobbying for lower rates and has gone to unusual lengths to shape monetary policy, including multiple legal threats.\n\nLast week, he achieved a key aim: finding a replacement for Powell (whose term as Fed chair ends in May) who is suitably dovish, but isn’t seen as so close to the White House that it would spook markets.\n\nWhat criminal investigations involve Fed officials currently?\n\nWhy are Democrats blocking Kevin Warsh's Fed nomination?\n\nWhy did Stephen Miran resign from CEA?\n\nHow might Powell stay beyond his May term?\n\nKevin Warsh, a former Fed governor under Ben Bernanke, didn’t upset markets beyond potentially adding to the decline in precious metal prices with his hawkish tone on the central bank’s balance sheet. But Warsh may not shape the tone of conversations on the base-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) as quickly as Trump might have hoped.\n\nThat’s because Warsh has to get through Senate Banking Committee hearings before being approved, and Democrats on the panel are refusing to proceed until criminal proceedings brought by the Trump administration against Fed members have been dropped.\n\n“We demand that you delay any nomination proceedings for Mr. Warsh until after the pretextual criminal investigations involving Chair Powell and Governor [Lisa] Cook have been closed,” banking committee Democrats said in a statement.\n\nCurrently, two members of the FOMC are facing court action: Powell himself and Fed Governor Cook. So far, the U.S. Supreme Court has barred President Trump’s September attempt to remove Cook from her post on the basis of claims that she had fraudulently secured favorable mortgage terms before she joined the Fed. Cook denies the allegations.\n\nEarlier this month, Powell also confirmed he was under criminal investigation by the Department of Justice over testimony he gave to a Senate committee about renovations to Federal Reserve buildings. The renovation costs have been a point of debate between Trump and Powell, and the duo argued in July (in front of the world media) over whether the budget had been exceeded.\n\nThe Democrats added: “The [Warsh] nomination comes after months of repeated efforts by President Trump and his administration to influence the Fed by intimidation, including by opening criminal investigations into Fed Governor Cook and Fed Chair Powell. These ongoing efforts by the president to control the Fed—which must be able to exercise independent judgment—undermine public confidence in any nomination for chair at this time.”",

    "description": "Bitcoin sank after Treasury Secretary Bessent said banks would not bail out crypto.",
    "fullText": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell 2% on Wednesday to around $73,000 per token after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the US government would not bail out the cryptocurrency.\n\nIn a heated back-and-forth during a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Bessent was asked if the US Treasury had the authority to buy bitcoin or other cryptos.\n\n\"I do not have the authority to do that, and as chair of FSOC, I do not have that authority,\" Bessent stated.\n\nThe decline on Wednesday was also fueled by the broader selling pressure in markets and a warning from notable investor Michael Burry that a sustained decline in bitcoin's price could \"set in motion a death spiral leading to massive value destruction.\"\n\n\"Bitcoin has been exposed as a purely speculative asset, and is not near the debasement trade hedge that gold and other precious metals are,\" Burry, who rose to prominence after predicting the 2008 financial crisis, wrote in his Substack.\n\nThe move lower only added to bitcoin's recent rout. The world's largest cryptocurrency is down 13% over the past five days.\n\nThe world's largest cryptocurrency dropped sharply last weekend, touching its lowest levels since last April and notching a fourth straight month of losses.\n\nThe move lower coincided with President Trump's announcement on Friday selecting Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve when Jerome Powell's term ends in May, a nomination markets view as hawkish.\n\nWhat are analysts saying about Bitcoin's support levels?\n\nHow has Bitcoin performed over recent months?\n\nWhat is Michael Burry's warning about Bitcoin's decline?\n\nWhy did Bitcoin drop after Treasury Secretary Bessent's comments?\n\nEther (ETH-USD) and other digital tokens also slid.\n\nWith bitcoin's next support level at $73,000, \"current flows suggest sentiment has shifted meaningfully,\" 10X Research strategists wrote in a recent note.\n\nThe firm's strategists pointed to flow and positioning data, which indicated \"investors are not yet positioned to buy the dip.\"\n\n\"While sentiment and technical indicators are approaching extreme levels, the broader downtrend remains intact,\" the researchers wrote. \"In the absence of a clear catalyst, there is little urgency to step in.\"\n\nThe firm noted that traders remain focused on deleveraging and unwinding their positions rather than on preparing for a typical snapback rally.\n\nPressure on digital assets reflected the broader fragility across the crypto market. Aside from a brief bounce last month, bitcoin has struggled since October, when whale selling and forced liquidations swept through the industry.",

    "fullText": "The downturn in the pizza restaurant sector is continuing into 2026 with major dining chains closing hundreds of locations, making it more difficult for consumers to get their favorite meal.\n\nPizza restaurants have faced severe economic headwinds over the last two years, as several chains have dealt with fierce competition, rising labor and food costs, and high lease rates requiring several companies to launch out-of-court restructurings, close locations, and in some cases, file for bankruptcy.\n\nSeattle-based Mod Pizza operated about 500 locations in 2024, but economic challenges forced it to close 27 units and sell its assets to Chatsworth, Calif.-based Elite Restaurant Group.\n\nThe restaurant chain did not solve its economic problems and has continued closing locations, as its website lists 448 units as of Feb. 4.\n\nOther smaller pizza chains filed for bankruptcy in 2025, including Bertucci's Restaurants, which filed for Chapter 11 protection on April 24, 2025, and Backdraughts, filing on July 23, 2025.\n\nMajor pizza restaurant franchisees also had financial difficulty last year and filed for bankruptcy protection, including Domino’s operator People First Pizza Inc., which filed Chapter 11 on March 26, 2025, and Little Caesars franchisee Red Door Pizza LLC, which filed its petition on July 15, 2025.\n\nDomino's holds the title of largest pizza chain in the U.S. with about 7,090 units through the third quarter of 2025, according to the \"Domino's 101: Fun facts\" on the company's website.\n\nLittle Caesars claims to be the third-largest pizza chain in the U.S., but doesn't list its total locations. The chain appears to have over 4,200 in the U.S., according to LocationsCloud.\n\nPizza Hut claims to operate over 6,700 locations in the U.S., according to its website, but the chain will soon be shrinking.\n\nGiant pizza dining chain Pizza Hut said it will close 250 underperforming restaurant locations as part of its Hut Forward plan in the first half of 2026, after reporting a 1% same-store sales decline globally in the fourth quarter and for the year in 2025, parent Yum! Brands' Chief Financial Officer Ranjith Roy said in the company's Q4 2025 earnings call Feb. 4.\n\nThe company, however, reported a 1% increase in same-store sales for Pizza Hut International, with strength in the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia.\n\nThe Hut Forward program consists of a vibrant marketing program, which includes a one-time Yum! marketing support contribution, modernization of certain technology and franchise agreements, and targeted closures of underperforming units, Roy said in the earnings call.",

    "description": "Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar, say they will not release billions in rebuilding aid until Hamas disarms and enforceable security guarantees are in place. The metal gates of the Rafah crossing swung open Monday morning for the first time in nearly two years.",
    "fullText": "Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar, say they will not release billions in rebuilding aid until Hamas disarms and enforceable security guarantees are in place.\n\nThe metal gates of the Rafah crossing swung open Monday morning for the first time in nearly two years. But just five medical patients and their companions, along with just over a dozen others who made it through that first day, were a stark illustration of how far the Gaza ceasefire remains from delivering on its promises.\n\nFamilies camped overnight in the cold outside the crossing, waiting through hours-long Israeli and Egyptian biometric security screenings.\n\nAmbulances lined up on both sides of the border, shuttling critical medical cases through checkpoints where European Union monitors supervised the processing. On the Egyptian side, aid staging areas sat empty. Humanitarian workers described confusion about coordination and next steps.\n\nThe slow processing and stringent security protocols reflect broader tensions. But the real battle isn't about border crossings. It's about weapons.\n\nPresident Donald Trump insists Hamas will disarm \"because they have no choice.\" His special envoy,Steve Witkoff, says the group \"will give up their AK-47s.\" Senior Hamas officials say that the conversation never happened.\n\n“Our priority has always been stopping the war and protecting civilians, not negotiating away weapons,” senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzook told Al Jazeera last week. US proposals ranging from freezing arms to full disarmament were discussed in theory, he said, but never became part of formal negotiations.\n\nThat disconnect now hangs over everything labeled “phase two”: reconstruction, governance, and long-term security. Phase two effectively came into focus last week with the return of the final Israeli hostage’s remains. What happens next, however, is still unclear.\n\nNo international force has been deployed to Gaza to collect or verify weapons. No mechanism exists to enforce disarmament. More than two dozen countries participate in coordination meetings about Gaza's future. None has committed troops.\n\n\"Phase Two has been announced, but in reality, it has not begun because Hamas rejects several core elements, and no one is forcing compliance,\" Edmund Fitton-Brown, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who previously coordinated the UN Security Council's monitoring team for Islamic State and al-Qaeda, told The Media Line. \"The announcement was premature. It reflected diplomatic optimism rather than facts on the ground.\"\n\n“Israel cannot demilitarize Hamas on its own, especially in areas where Israeli forces are no longer present,” Fitton-Brown said. “Enforced disarmament would require a transitional authority backed by an international stabilization force.”\n\n\"Without a monopoly on coercion, there is no government,\" Fitton-Brown said. \"If Hamas retains weapons and organized armed units, it retains power regardless of what administrative structures exist on paper.\"\n\nGetting countries to commit forces has proven impossible. Egypt has ruled out deploying troops inside Gaza. European countries will support governance structures but not provide combat forces. Turkey supports Hamas politically. Gulf states that might fund reconstruction won't commit forces.\n\n\"Many countries want their flag present but not their soldiers at risk,\" Fitton-Brown said. \"That defeats the purpose.\"\n\nIsrael will not compromise on demilitarization. “The Israeli government has made it very clear that it will not compromise on the demilitarization of Hamas,” Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official and founder of Inside the Middle East, told The Media Line. “This is not only the position of the current government. Any Israeli government would demand the dismantling of Hamas’s military capabilities.”\n\nAt the same time, Melamed said Israel does not expect Hamas to voluntarily disarm. “Nobody has any illusion that Hamas is going to disarm itself,” he said. “Demilitarization is not about removing every weapon. It is mainly about offensive weapons — rockets and advanced arms that can be used against Israeli territory. Israel’s priority is to eliminate Hamas’s ability to manufacture rockets and dismantle its command structure.”\n\nBut even that limited definition creates a practical dilemma. Achieving it would require renewed Israeli military operations, which would undermine the ceasefire, or the deployment of an external force willing to confront Hamas directly. Neither currently exists, short of renewed Israeli military action that would likely collapse the ceasefire.\n\nHamas is pressing to include its roughly 10,000-strong police force in the new governance architecture. According to multiple sources, Hamas has urged its civil and security personnel to cooperate with the US-backed National Committee for the Administration of Gaza while seeking to have its police formally incorporated. Israel has rejected the proposal. The force is inseparable from Hamas's broader security apparatus, Israeli officials argue.\n\nAn internal Hamas document obtained by Israeli broadcaster Kan reveals the group's strategy for maintaining control while appearing to cooperate. The directive tells administrators to maintain normal work routines while prohibiting them from attacking members of the new technocratic government on social media. The key instruction: \"No personal contact should be made, or information and news should be passed to them except through the relevant authority.\" Hamas itself retains control over all communication channels.\n\nIsraeli military intelligence assessments delivered to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warn that Hamas continues deepening its governance structures and taking concrete steps to preserve influence by integrating members into government ministries and the security apparatus, according to Israeli officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"Hamas does not want to openly reject the peace plan because doing so would provoke a decisive response from Washington and potentially from Israel,\" Fitton-Brown said. \"Instead, Hamas signals conditional cooperation while avoiding real compliance.\"\n\nHamas' messaging has been deliberately contradictory. Some figures say openly they will never disarm. Others suggest weapons might be placed in storage, a freeze rather than surrender. That reflected a tactical debate within Hamas, not a genuine willingness to disarm.\n\nHamas officials have blamed ongoing Israeli military operations for blocking the technocratic committee from functioning, arguing the group's priority is enabling the independent national committee to assume responsibilities in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli officials see this as confirmation that Hamas plans to maintain organized armed forces under a new administrative label.\n\nAssessing Hamas' remaining capabilities is difficult. Before October 2023, Israeli and American officials estimated Hamas possessed between 15,000 and 30,000 rockets, along with large stockpiles of small arms, anti-tank weapons, drones, and an extensive tunnel network. Israeli officials now say most capabilities have been destroyed or degraded, but acknowledge Hamas retains residual weapons, substantial underground infrastructure, and organized armed cells capable of limited attacks.\n\n“In the current context, rapid or forced disarmament is unrealistic and would require coordination with Hamas and a gradual process,” Adel al-Ghoul, a Palestinian political analyst and head of the Paris Center for Security Studies and International Relations, told The Media Line.\n\n“The approach most widely discussed internationally is not disarmament by force, but the gradual containment and neutralization of weapons through stronger Palestinian security institutions, improved economic conditions, and incentives for stability over chaos.”\n\nThe crossing reopening offered a glimpse of limited progress. Young men and elderly Palestinians waiting in line spoke of relief mixed with frustration. Glad to see any movement after nearly two years. Angry at how marginal the flows remain.\n\nMeanwhile, on-the-ground recovery proceeds incrementally. The UN Development Program has cleared approximately 50,000 tons of rubble since the ceasefire began in October, including at a new Khan Yunis crushing facility processing roughly 1,000 tons daily. But UN estimates suggest Gaza contains more than 40 million tons of debris that will take years to remove.\n\nBroader reconstruction remains stalled. A postwar redevelopment proposal promoted by Jared Kushner and unveiled at Davos last month envisions up to 100,000 housing units in a rebuilt \"New Rafah,\" along with schools, hospitals, and commercial zones. The plan explicitly conditions large-scale construction on verified Hamas disarmament.\n\nThe United States has not committed funding for large-scale reconstruction. Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar, say they will not release billions in rebuilding aid until Hamas disarms and enforceable security guarantees are in place. Requirements that have not yet been clearly defined or implemented.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes continue across Gaza despite the ceasefire. Health officials say more than 500 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began last October. Israel says the strikes target Hamas military operatives and weapons infrastructure.\n\nDiscussions about deploying international forces continue but remain entirely preliminary. No country has offered concrete troop commitments. The technocratic committee tasked with governing Gaza has been announced but has not yet begun to function in any meaningful way.\n\n“Hamas still maintains social and organizational influence on the ground, even where its military role has declined,” al-Ghoul said. “Any new administration would have to rely on indirect coordination or avoid direct confrontation.”",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A government lawyer who told a judge that her job “sucks” during a court hearing stemming from the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota has been removed from her Justice Department post, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nJulie Le had been working for the Justice Department on a detail, but the U.S. attorney in Minnesota ended her assignment after her comments in court on Tuesday, the person said. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter. She had been working for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement before the temporary assignment.\n\nAt a hearing Tuesday in St. Paul, Minnesota, for several immigration cases, Le told U.S. District Judge Jerry Blackwell that she wishes he could hold her in contempt of court “so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep.”\n\n“What do you want me to do? The system sucks. This job sucks. And I am trying every breath that I have so that I can get you what you need,” Le said, according to a transcript.\n\nLe's extraordinary remarks reflect the intense strain that has been placed on the federal court system since President Donald Trump returned to the White House a year ago with a promise to carry out mass deportations. ICE officials have said the surge in Minnesota has become its largest-ever immigration operation since ramping up in early January.\n\nSeveral prosecutors have left the U.S. Attorney’s office in Minnesota amid frustration with the immigration enforcement surge and the Justice Department’s response to fatal shootings of two civilians by federal agents. Le was assigned at least 88 cases in less than a month, according to online court records.\n\nBlackwell told Le that the volume of cases isn't an excuse for disregarding court orders. He expressed concern that people arrested in immigration enforcement operations are routinely jailed for days after judges have ordered their release from custody.\n\n“And I hear the concerns about all the energy that this is causing the DOJ to expend, but, with respect, some of it is of your own making by not complying with orders,” the judge told Le.\n\nLe said she was working for the Department of Homeland Security as an ICE attorney in immigration court before she “stupidly” volunteered to work the detail in Minnesota. Le told the judge that she wasn't properly trained for the assignment. She said she wanted to resign from the job but couldn't get a replacement.\n\n\"Fixing a system, a broken system, I don’t have a magic button to do it. I don’t have the power or the voice to do it,\" she said.\n\nHomeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Le was a probationary attorney.\n\n“This conduct is unprofessional and unbecoming of an ICE attorney in abandoning her obligation to act with commitment, dedication, and zeal to the interests of the United States Government,” McLaughlin said in a statement.\n\nLe and the U.S. Attorney's office in Minnesota didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nKira Kelley, an attorney who represented two petitioners at the hearing, said the flood of immigration petitions is necessary because “so many people being detained without any semblance of a lawful basis.”\n\n“And there’s no indication here that any new systems or bolded e-mails or any instructions to ICE are going to fix any of this,” she added.",

    "fullText": "ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia Republican U.S. House member Barry Loudermilk, who has been active in efforts to discredit Democratic-led investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, announced Wednesday that he won't seek reelection this year.\n\nLoudermilk has served in Congress since 2015. He is part of a wave of incumbents exiting the House. So far, 50 are stepping down or running for some other office.\n\nFour Republican-held congressional seats in Georgia will change hands this year. In addition to Loudermilk, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene resigned from her seat in January, setting up a March special election. U.S. Reps. Buddy Carter and Mike Collins are both running for the GOP's U.S. Senate nomination, aiming to unseat incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff.\n\nLoudermilk, 62, said in a statement that he wanted to spend “more dedicated time” with his family.\n\n“I first ran for election to Congress in 2014 and, as I stated then, representing the people in Congress is a service, not a career,\" Loudermilk said. \"And although I continue to have strong support from the people of the 11th Congressional District, I believe it is time to contribute to my community, state, and nation in other ways.”\n\nThe 11th Congressional District, northwest of Atlanta, includes all of Bartow, Gordon and Pickens counties and parts of Cherokee and Cobb counties. The Cook Political Report ranks the district as the fifth-most strongly Republican district of the nine that the GOP holds in Georgia.\n\nBefore serving in Congress, Loudermilk served in the Air Force. He chaired the Bartow County Republican Party and then served six years in the Georgia state House of Representatives and two years in the state Senate.\n\nLoudermilk was scrutinized by the House Jan. 6 committee for giving a tour of parts of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021. The committee suggested that some tour participants may have been examining security measures. Loudermilk denied wrongdoing, saying it was a “smear campaign.”\n\nAfter Republicans took the majority, Loudermilk led a subcommittee that released a report alleging former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney acted improperly on the Democratic-led Jan. 6 committee and calling for her to be investigated for criminal witness tampering. Loudermilk currently leads another subcommittee that is charged with further investigating Jan. 6.",

    "fullText": "O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson’s daughter, Sydney Simpson, is living a quiet life in Florida following the death of her father.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, Sydney, 40, left Los Angeles for St. Petersburg, Florida, where she lives in a small, two-bedroom condo. The outlet reported that Sydney, who was just 8 years old when her mother was murdered, purchased the 955-square-foot unit for $135,000 cash in December 2020.\n\n“It’s lower-income, they’re poor. They’re on Medicare, Medicaid, you know, SNAP [benefits] if they can get them. There’s no job opportunities — there’s nothing in that section of town. Then you get into Downtown and head north, and that’s where the money is,” a man named Peter Gaunt — who has lived in the neighborhood for decades — told the outlet of the area.\n\nThe former Buffalo Bills running back shared Sydney and her brother Justin with his ex-wife, Nicole.\n\nNicole and friend Ron Goldman were brutally murdered outside her Brentwood home in June 1994.\n\nO.J. was charged with their murders, but was later acquitted by a jury. He died at age 76 on April 11, 2024, after a battle with prostate cancer.\n\nPresident Trump Reached Out to ‘Today’ Host Savannah Guthrie Amid Her Mom Nancy’s Disappearance\n\nIvanka Trump Reportedly 'Has Zero Intention of Seeing' Stepmother Melania's Eponymous Documentary\n\nElisabeth Hasselbeck Returning to 'The View' to Replace Alyssa Farah Griffin After Calling Out Joy Behar\n\nThis story O.J.
