    "description": "A remarkably well-preserved Roman sarcophagus has been unearthed in Hungary’s capital, offering a rare window into the life of the young woman inside and the world she inhabited around 1,700 years ago.  Archaeologists with the Budapest History Museum discovered the limestone coffin during a large-scale excavation in Óbuda, a northern district of the city that once formed part of Aquincum, a bustling Roman settlement on the Danube frontier.  Untouched by looters and sealed for centuries, the sarcophagus was found with its stone lid still fixed in place, secured by metal clamps and molten lead.",

    "description": "Research has shown that sponsorship tends to benefit junior employees, but its impact on sponsors is less understood. A new study, the first to examine sponsorship from a leadership perspective, reveals that men and women differ in their approaches. Men tend to pursue few goals in sponsorship, and largely pursue those that benefit their own career development. Additionally, men are more likely to leverage sparse, unconnected networks, giving them opportunities to strengthen their own connections alongside their protégé. Women, however, juggle multiple, conflicting goals, which can be mentally taxing.",

    "description": "Many of today’s toughest strategic challenges are “wicked problems”—issues shaped by tangled variables, shifting outcomes, and stakeholder complexity that overwhelm traditional analytics. Quantum modelling offers a new way forward. Even without quantum computers, quantum-inspired models running on conventional hardware can evaluate interdependent variables simultaneously, revealing patterns linear, regression-based tools can’t capture. Unlike traditional models that assume independent causes, quantum modelling analyzes entangled combinations of variables to explain outcomes more accurately. To make use of this technology, companies need to start small, partner smartly, and build quantum literacy.",

    "description": "The era of console wars seems to be nearing its end, but one of its key players, Peter Moore, who led the charge during the launch of the Xbox 360, is sharing his memories of his time on the gaming frontlines. When it came to pitting the Xbox 360 against the PlayStation 3, Moore says 10 million was the magic number--\"You've got this flywheel effect ... of [if] your mate in the school yard's got one, you better get one.\"\nSpeaking to Eurogamer, Moore explained that getting the Xbox 360 into the market ahead of the PS3 was key to its strong performance, saying that the first 10 million sales were vital. \"I think it was really important to get it out first,\" Moore said.",
