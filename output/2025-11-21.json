Sassoon, who graduated from Harvard College in 2008 and from Yale Law School in 2011, was adamant that she never suggested such a deal and had gone to great lengths to insist to the woman’s lawyers that no deal like that was possible.",

Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of 3 open-weight LLM judges, whose binary safety assessments were validated on a stratified human-labeled subset.",

To get information out of them, IBM has to figure out how to transform information in stationary \"qubits\" -- the fundamental unit of information in a quantum computer -- into what Jay Gambetta, director of IBM Research and an IBM fellow, told Reuters are \"flying\" qubits that travel as microwaves.",
